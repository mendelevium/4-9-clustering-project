/user_details?userid=ykuDGEj5J1PKs-0huwiVVg,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a great Indian fusion restaurant. It's in the heart of St. Henri walking distance to the Atwater market. More important now than ever to support local restaurants. They're currently offering takeout during the pandemic. When things go back to normal definitely sit outside on their terrace during the spring, summer and fall months they have one of the nicest ones on the entire street. If Indian cuisine isn't up your alley this restaurant will completely change your mind! Check them out."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favourite restaurants. It's Indian fusion which means they have some dishes that aren't traditional Indian in case you're not into India food (although is that possible?!). I usually make reservations with my girl friends on Wednesday nights because they have a great deal where you eat for free off from a selected menu when you order a bottle of wine for two people. This time I went on a Saturday and was very excited to try some other items on the menu.They take reservations on open table and I suggest making them ahead of time. The staff is always very friendly and bilingual. Quick service as well. The decor of this place makes it seem like a much more expensive restaurant and gives it a nice charm. Very good drinks menu with cocktails and wine available by the glass or bottle. For food we started with the tuna tartar which was so nice and fresh. For mains we ordered the chicken fried rice and the chicken jalfrezi with some garlic naan bread. We were blown away by every dish! The portions seems small when they arrived but we were barely able to finish. Will be coming back here soon!
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"If you never had Indian food, it's a good place to start.I would typically say that I'm not a huge fan of Indian food because lots of the dishes are in mushy form and don't look appetizing.Rasoï is a fusion Indian restaurant with great flavours. Once you get in the restaurant, it is very clean, modern with a touch of Indian history. Because like it or not, most Indian restaurant in park ex are not the cleanest or nicest restaurant in town...and it's always more pleasant to be in a place that looks nice and clean.The menu has a lot to choose from. We started with the venison samosas. Flavours were good but was expecting a bit more...especially after trying their fish and chip dish. The fish was so flaky and full of flavour...best dish of the entire night. Venison samosas were different from your typical veges samosas. If you can take gamy taste, you will like it.We the had a chicken in sauce dish which was excellent, shrimps and scallops which was decadent and a side of rice and garlic and coriander naan bread. To my surprise, the naan bread was my least favourite...All in all, I really enjoyed my experience in this Indian fusion restaurant. Service was also very nice so no complaints there."
/user_details?userid=2YWHVzV9QGuaTA527kQUIw,Agunik M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Loved this place! I got a gift card to come here from good friends and I am left feeling pretty thrilled! Our waitress (with long curly hair) was extremely nice and sociable and it felt like the rest of the staff really cared to make our experience great. Food: really good! The recommended was to get two starters and two mains (tapas style) and it was the perfect quantity. The actual food itself was definitely westernized but still had an authentic touch to it (had the deer samosas, fish pakora, lamb with almonds [SPICY!], and butter chicken). Drinks: good but nothing too special--does the job! Definitely would like to come back 10/10."

Keep in mind that they are building a bar in their basement and are therefore now 18+ (so this is not good for a family meal).Our waitress was extremely kind and knowledgable about the menu. They say that you should order two plates since they are tapas style but I had the goat vindaloo and was more than full for the rest of the night. The goat was extremely tender and flavourful. I also tried the tandoori chicken, which was tasty- but not as good as the goat! The prices are pretty steep but totally worth it! It was a fantastic meal and I look forward to going back very soon!!"
/user_details?userid=o3_t6wfB5BctyOQym_775g,Patrick B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"All right so we held our company Christmas party at this restaurant. So I did not get the full restaurant experience. I can confirm the place is clean and we were afforded the downstairs room which can be reserved and comfortably accommodated 30 people.Staff was friendly and helpful. Decor and atmosphere is warm with lots of dark woods.Beer selection was limited and uninspired with the only 1 Indian option the rest of it being at all those up wonderful of Molson products. which brings me to the somewhat disappointing at part of the evening which was the actual food. Although not inedible or disgusting in any way ... the Tapas Style menu is somewhat bland and far from anything resembling authentic Indian cuisine.  It's more like a ""white bread"" take on Indian cuisine.So overall up pretty decent however would advise other options if looking for an authentic Indian experience"

We had the onion bhaji, lamb curry, chicken chipotle and NAAN yes obviously.Everything was so delicious i kept smiling the whole time.Only thing I didn't like is the fact that the waitresses came in pair that was odd & pushy in a way lol.Other than that LOVED IT.

/user_details?userid=JDUKmC223wYPLsmem-ItrQ,Miles B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went here at the recommendation of a friend as was very impressed! Great food, great cocktails, and great service!!The food was not traditional Indian fare but a surprising take on many classics that were well thought out and flavourful. To start, we had fish pakoras and house chips (lots of flavor in the pakoras that transferred onto the chips -yum!) With a yoghurt tartar sauce. We also had the deer samosas which were suprising and delightful! They definitely did not skimp on the deer, which was exciting. The side ""kachumber"" salad with the samosas was a mix of chickpeas, rice noodles, cucumber, and spice and paired well with the deer in the samosas. The sauces were great: gumbo mustard had a nice heat while the mango chutney was refreshing and cool - they balanced each other well.As mains, we had butter chicken, and almond butter lamb curry. The butter chicken was delicious, and the marinade was visible in the chicken. The lamb had an explosion of spice, and flavourful, with a nice strong heat. Accompanying that was the garlic and cilantro naan, and a regular naan (both the same price, which was really nice to not see an upcharge for changing flavours for naan).As cocktails, we had a few:The Cajun bloody ceasar (with bacon!) was really well spiced, and refreshing. The tech support had a nice sweetness and flavour from the spruce beer. The Robin Hood was a beauty with sweetness of peach, and tart from the grapefruit. The last cocktail was an off-menu one whose name escapes me, but it was cool and delicious, like an iced chai tea.The service was impeccable. Friendly and nice, the service alone would make me go back!We dined on the terrace, which had high walls blocking the street which was much appreciated. It gave the feeling of being in a back garden terrace!"

Btw, it's perfect for small + large rooms and has a fully equipped bar and DJ station.The food is good. It's definitely not the most authentic Indian food you'll come by, but I don't get the impression that's what they're going for. Many of the items on their menu are fun, modern twists using traditional ingredients.  I'd also suggest going with a group of friends; their plates and portions are perfect for sharing. And let's be honest, who doesn't want to try a little bit of everything?Funny enough, out of all of the dishes that I've tasted, my absolute favourite was the most traditional, the Goat Vindaloo.I've returned many times and chances are, I'll return again."

Went for a birthday and had a tasting menu done & it was okay, for the price, but wouldn't do the tasting menu again, it was good, but its better to just get what you actually want instead of what the waiter picks for you! Would recommend"

The food comes in smaller tapas-size portions but it's packed full of flavour, best to order many and share with friends, loved ones or just for yourself!I tried the onion bahji, the chana masala and the aubergine dish, they are all vegan and super delicious (and spicy!)! The cocktails are very imaginative, I was there once with friends and some of them ordered the odd one that had tomato juice and celery salt, but it was really well balanced and the flavours came through nicely, I was actually sold!"
/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wish we could give half stars. Rasoï gets a 3 1/2 in my books. I've been here a total of 4 times and so my review is an amalgamation of my 4 experiences. So first of the ambiance is rustic, romantic.. very rue notre dame hipster. It lacked lighting for me personally but I get the mood they're going for. The service was good, and the majority of my stars are for service. I've got to hand it to Rasoï, good service is hard to come by in the city and the servers along with the busboys were courteous, quick and kind. Our server had a decent knowledge of the menu items although lacked in depth knowledge of what ingredients some items consisted for a connoisseur. Our water glasses were always full, empty plates were swiftly picked up and our naans were quickly replenished. Finally for the food, I give it a 3. We had the goat curry, butter chicken, fig pizza and fish pakoras. There wasn't anything fusion about the curries.. nor the Fish pakoras. The fig pizza was good but a little on the sweeter side. Overall, It's good enough to try but not a place I'd crave to go back."
/user_details?userid=l5QUFf1R8FnvYivAigOAiA,Jillian G.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"My experience at Rasoï was a bit off, but I still left happy + full delish food. WARNING - I am not an Indian food expert by any means. Im a typical white North American in that I merely tried butter chicken at a wedding once and was hooked, and have tried a handful of Indian restaurants since that moment about 5 months ago. Annnnyyyways I headed to Rasoi with a group of 7 gals. We sat at the large table by the window, a great cozy spot in the corner. The place was just loud enough to create an enjoyable atmosphere, and like prior reviews have said, the decorations are unbelieveable - even the bathrooms! If you can find themMy group had many that were late, and we all trickled in over an hour between 6&7. I attribute this to the SLLLLLOW service. I think. I feel like I have to blame it on something. The drinks were flowing, but once we placed our order, it took over an hour to receive our food. The waiter checked in once to let us know the food would be coming, and then disappeared for 30 minutes until the food came. I ordered the Almond Butter Lamb. The lamb was great. Suuuper tender. But the flavors weren't anything special. Good, but that's about it. I also got the garlic naan, which I could've eaten 4lbs of if I wasn't around others who would definitely be repulsed by such an act. The winning act was the server apologized for the food delay & brought our table dessert. A mix of delicious brûlée's that were SO good Anyways - all in all I enjoyed my dinner here, and appreciated the restaurants kind act to make up for the delay of dinner"

The staff was super nice the waitress helped us what to order since it was our first time and she gave us recommendations and they repeatedly came and asked us if we were alright. The food was great it was Indian food but with a modern twist unfortunately I didn't take any pics :( but it was all good portions and really filled us up. I got the Chipotle chicken tikka masala and it was sooo good and tasty especially with the naan that I ordered. I love how they had vegan options because two of my friends are vegan and they also loved their food. I reallly recommend this place you won't regret it :)

The room was very dark, music very loud. Beautifully decorated but made it very hard to socialize. Onion bhajis were good, nothing over the top. The spring rolls were pretty good. The fig pizza was AMAZING on this crust naan. It is a must have, you will not be disappointed. I couldn't have a salad because there was no b vegetarian option unfortunately. I was quite disappointed with their lamb korma. The curry was too sweet, didn't taste like korma at all. I didn't end up eating it. My friends tasted it and all agreed that it was too sweet. The naans were fresh and very soft. They had a few mocktail options, I had one but can't remember the same and it was great! Overall a great fusion restaurant. Definitely plan on going there to try other items on the menu."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Dining in Rasoi was an enjoyable and flavourful experience. We were party of nine and our long table was in process of being set up when we arrived, so the bar was the obvious place to attack with an immediate demand for Bloody Caesar. The smiling bartender fixed a pretty good drink for some of us, mine being non virgin and non vegetarian spicy version with beautiful piece of bacon. Once seated our orders were collected promptly. Bring a magnifier if you have one as the menu is written in the smallest possible script and it may be hard to read the detailed descriptions of the dishes. Appetizers and mains arrived orderly, and were served with a smile, even the chef checked on us. The arugula salad was nice mix of fresh ingredients and could be ordered without the few fried calamari pieces, which I realized too late. For mains I tried two of the traditional Indian vegetarian dishes: okra masala and chick peas. Both were absolutely delicious and quite spicy, definitely not spicy hot, but seasoning was used generously. The food was served in small bowls and its quantity is more of a tapas size, but I find it sufficient in terms of value for money. The interior design of Rasoi is to write for, there are a lot of nice cultural elements incorporated in the brick walls that indicate the ethnicity of the cuisine you would try, but the ceiling is what made me smile that night. Its colourful hippy flowers remind the 70s and made me sing in my mind ""love, peace, freedom, happiness"". My only complaint is the fact that my cloths smelled curry the next day, obviously the ventilation in the kitchen can be improved, but this is not a good reason to remove rating starts. Great dining option in the area!"

/user_details?userid=DKXCQJQupcIUnBdNATXbdg,Oumou K.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Background: I visited Montreal for a week and was pretty much open to eating and trying anything. I've never been disappointed with Indian food so I decided to try this place! As my appetizer, I had lamb poutine. As my entree, I had garlic naan with chicken tikka masala. Pros1. Friendly and welcoming staff2. Not a long wait time to be seated3. Great ambiance 4. Comfortable seating Cons1. Food took a while to come out (35+ mins)2. Basmati rice does not come with your meal Overall: Everything was GREAT. Although I love lamb I was very hesitant on trying the lamb poutine for many reasons. But since poutine is on the Montreal ""must eat"" list, I couldn't allow myself to leave without trying. I ate it and definitely could've eaten another plate. Lamb was made to perfection. The right amount of gravy (not too little and not too much) and the cheese curds was also a perfection additional. The garlic naan was fresh and extremely tasty. The chicken tikka masala was tender, juicy, and made with soooooooo much LOVEEEE. Do note that if you want rice, you have to order it separately. It does not come with your meal. I would highly recommend this place!!"
/user_details?userid=AdWHssUZ1UAQogNys7uweA,Glenn S.,"Peterborough, Canada",1 star rating,"Overpriced, limited selection of authentic Indian food and very small portions for the amount of money that they charge.Was also a bit offended that they started the conversation and talked to us in english assuming that we did not speak french.The owner pushed the fact that he is expanding his basement into a bar.  Assume based on the restaurant, that your drinks will cost a lot and be small."

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was a really pleasant surprise. I booked the table by the window at the request of my friend. The ambiance definitely gets full points! It has a traditional vibe with large paintings of Indian women with a lounge-like feel. Very upscale and modern with a tasteful amount of Indian culture. The doors leading into the dining room are grand and the wall by the bar is made of rice bags and oh so cool. The bathrooms downstairs are also very nice. If you're looking for an Indian restaurant that has proper cloth napkins and cutlery (not like the typical plastic plates and paper napkins) take a reservation here. The food is an ode to the chef's Indian heritage with a western twist. All the dishes have some kind of twist. We started with venison samosa and the onion bhaji- both mediocre. The samosa could use more spice and cilantro or mint. For our main meals, we tried the chipotle chicken tikka masala, the goat curry, the chili paneer, and the baighan with naan. Everything was delicious but some of the dishes didn't feel authentic to the title. For instance, the chicken was a cross between chicken jalfrezi and something with chipotle smokiness, but nothing really like tikka masala. I liked the planner best because it had a good spiciness to it. My partner liked the baighan most and it really was far better than the one I make. To end our meal, we shared a gulab jamun. Gummy and not like the soft gulab jamun it should have been but the presentation was nice and the scoop of ice cream was good. Also it had too much rose flavor in the syrup. I wouldn't order it again. But I think I'll be back here to try more dishes. My friend also had a virgin cucumber drink that was delicious, but slightly pricey. Overall, a good experience and decent on the wallet- we each spent about $25 (4 people) for a medium sized meal."

We dined in for ladies night where ladies receive a free appetizer and entree with the purchase of a bottle of wine between two people. The bottles included in this Wednesday deal start at $50.00 - so shared you're looking at $25.00 each. Food: Excellent. I started with the fish pakoras which were served like classic fish and chips (in a newspaper with kettle cooked chips). They didn't skimp on the amount of fish included in the pakoras and the batter and filling were flavourful and delicious. I then went with the Fig, Basil and Paneer naan pizza. They were able to lock down delicious Indian flavours on the pizza while still allowing the toppings to shine and work together to make a delicious plate!Service was great! Our waiters were attentive, helpful and patient to a table of seven girls!How dare I forget the decor. Beautiful!

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: On Notre-Dame West, a few minutes away from the Lionel-Groulx station. Street parking is available but metered. You may find free parking in some of the partially zoned areas (residential) but check the signage. The place: I LOVED the Indian-ispired decor: gorgeous brick walls, beautiful furniture + lighting, and the large sculpture of Ganesha complete the look and offer up a warm and cozy atmosphere. Let's not forget those crazy colourful ceilings, either!The food: After reading great reviews, I'd bookmarked Rasoi as a place to try. When the opportunity arose to do lunch with a friend, we decided to stop in. Having had two breakfasts (OK, don't judge), I kept my order small - I went with the Tuna Tartar [on mango and avocado served with a spiced mango puree and tortilla chips]. There was nothing Indian about this dish at all. Now, did I know this when I ordered? Yes. However, I expected this wouldn't matter since I'm a big fan of literally, all the above ingredients. While the presentation was pretty, the food itself was bland. I'm talking zero use of seasoning or spices, here. There's only so much you can do with raw tuna, but avocado and mango? You can totally spice/flavour that sh*t up. I'm not sure if the tortillas were store-bought or homemade, but they were also lacking in flavour. My side of naan was good but again, the flavour was missing. On the flip side, my friend ordered the vegetarian Thali and loved it. I could smell the amazing flavours emanating from her dish and regretted not ordering the same thing. The onion Bhaji was great, as were the chick peas. There was Basmati and naan served with this dish, along with a few other things that I don't recall - my date seriously enjoyed everything but the pickled carrots. I had a taste and I'm not sure if these guys were pickled in wine or cider but umm, no. Totally didn't work. Service: Under normal circumstances, this is where I would dock stars but our waiter was alone on the floor, and the place literally filled up right after we arrived.  I'm sure Rasoi staffs accordingly during rush hour, but it was unfortunate to see our poor server running around trying to cater to everyone, while apologizing repeatedly for delays. Price point: Depends what you order - my Tartar (it was an appetizer not a main) + naan was $20 with tax. The Thali ranges between $15-$21 though I'm not sure why. I'm going to presume this has to do with whether or not there's meat involved...."

Our waitress was energetic, extremely helpful in providing suggestions, and very friendly. The time it took between getting the menus and being able to put our order through was a little long, but the overall experience more than made up for it.The food was DELICIOUS. There were 4 of us, and we got to try about 7 different dishes, each equally impressive, flavourful and satisfying. The tandoori chicken on sizzling plate with rum-marinated pineapple was definitely a highlight. It was a great setting for a dinner with friends; perfectly noisy and cozy. Overall quality to price ratio is among the best I've seen in this kind of restaurant. It came out to around 25$ each before tip and drinks, which is more than reasonable. I definitely recommend!"

My sister had the curry poutine and she loved it, I didn't  think it was that great to be honest.  The meal does not come with basmati rice so make sure you ask for it. I ended up get the Chicken Tikka Saag Paneer for a  appetizer and the Chicken Tikka Masala for my main course, I believe she got lamb curry, we also ordered garlic naan and regular naan.

It was a Friday after work so delivery seemed like a nice treat.We were disappointed by tiny portions of both the $12 Butter Chicken (I counted six inch-sized cubes of Chicken which arrived in a small styrofoam cylinder mostly full of lukewarm non-spicy sauce) and also the $14 Vindaloo Goat Curry (which, to be fair, had tasty sauce, but was marred by a lack of goat and had two large bones which gave the illusion of the container being full.)The $4 marinated carrots were okay but unremarkable.The Garlic Naan was tasty but only one small piece for $3, so I ran out mid-meal and had to resort to using a fork.BTW no rice is included with the prices above. Expect to just get nearly full, lilliputian Styrofoam containers with questionable meat to sauce ratio.When you add in the $2.99 delivery fee, safe to say that I won't be ordering from there again. I wonder if the in house experience would be better? But if so, why treat some customers better than others?"

We weren't allowed to only have portions for the number of people who showed up. We were stuck with the portions for 15 people despite telling them a day in advance and despite telling them at the time we were less people. It's a Friday night. It's IMPOSSIBLE that the food UNCOOKED would have gone bad before their next service. ENTIRELY un-effing-acceptable. I couldn't believe a restaurant would act so recklessly when it comes to people buying 7+ $8 drinks on top of 6 bottles of wine and gave advanced notice of a possibly smaller group. Then they decided to ""be nice"" and only charge us for 13 people. When the confirmation call for the reservation was made, we were told we could move chairs, and that a change in numbers wouldn't be a problem. As if that was some huge favor. They also accepted a reservation for 830, knowing that their service takes so long and that they were ""doing us a favor"" by staying open late while we waited for our food. Our main dishes hadn't even come by 10:50. The last service, the actual main dishes, they gave us only 3 portions instead of the 4. So they're charging us for 13 ""as a favor"" but giving us portions for 12. So much for a favor... and these dishes aren't even enough to be mains for individuals, sincerely nothing impression in regards to portion size. The appetizers were good. The salads were awful. $12.80 bottle of SAQ wine for $38? That's way more than mark up.Would I come back as a a group? F*** no. As a couple? I would certainly come in and enjoy a couple of dishes with someone who could offer good conversation. The way this was treated as a smaller than expected group was entirely unacceptable and clearly avoidable. We tried to compensate with other purchases (like over priced wines and drinks) yet we were met with nothing more than callous disregard for repeat business. I would like to say that I wish the business the best of luck, but sincerely, I don't. $110 (18% added to the bill for tip despite the service by the waitress being less than prime to say the least) later I am SERIOUSLY disappointed. Certainly no desire to return beyond the decor and maybe 2-3 plates to share. To quote another reviewer (Blake) ""The food: over priced, overwrought,  unimaginative, tepid and unfulfilling."""

Staff was barely present as we had to continuously get up to ask for service. Food was good but not amazing. We were a table of 10 and  they had sat us near the uninsulated window where we all had to eat with our winter jackets on. We asked to be moved while the restaurant was still empty as we had 3 young children with us and the answer was no. Hopefully they step up their staff game again.

Sorry, but Rasoi sucks."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located right in St-Henri Rasoi is a restaurant that focuses on Indian fusion.  They have plenty of dishes that are considered traditional Indian food but they also have a few that combine Indian cuisine with that of another country.  Prices are reasonable for the area.The decor is Indian-inspired but also very warm and inviting.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly host who seated us immediately.  Our waitress was also efficient and welcoming.  The only minor complaint I have is that after our main dishes were cleared we weren't asked if we wanted dessert, coffee or tea and we had to flag her down to get the bills.To start I had Street Cart Spring Rolls which were traditional spring rolls with an Indian twist.  They had been seasoned with curry which was different but added a nice touch.  I topped it off with a naan pizza which was loaded with tandoori chicken, yogourt, cheese and onions.  The pizza was quite heavy but I really liked the chicken on it.  Most restaurants play it safe with the spice but these guys don't and I like that!They have happy hour specials on beer and wine seven days a week.  We were able to split a bottle of wine for $30 which was pretty reasonable.  Also take note that the restaurant was fairly packed so it is best to play it safe and reserve (which you can easily do from the Yelp app FYI)."

After the appetizer, we waited almost 40 minutes for our food.Ordered the tuna tartar, the avocado and mango were noticeably unripe - crunchy. The chef should know not to serve food that isn't ripe. In all there were about three tablespoons worth of tuna. On a plate that costs $15, that is just not acceptable.That said, the serving staff is always very friendly.Rasoï is medium-high on the price scale, but I don't think the portions or the culinary craft can really justify it."
/user_details?userid=IfWEkD4BNE4WVyldHX94vg,Peka Pie S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,Some may say that I travel around the world to find the best paneer. Found some! Let's just say the paneer tikka appetizer was amazing!! This is not your traditional Indian Restaurant it's fusion. For someone that loves a good traditional Indian meal this place still hit the spot. I would recommend the paneer tikka (dry) and chipotle chicken tikka masala (with gravy). The cocktails were also good and the service was exceptional! Thanks Rex and team for making our dining experience awesome!

/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"{rasoI} = KITCHEN (Noun)Everyone has  that certain cuisine that they love. Anytime there is celebration or a special meal, it is the cuisine your friends and family always turn to. For us that is Indian food. Now we have all tried the standard fare, butter chicken, daal, Paneer Tikka Masala just to name a few. But when you try the food at Rasoi  there is nothing standard about it.Immediately upon entering the establishment the first thing you notice is the decor. From the brick walls displaying a scattering of mirrors to the exquisite lamps it is a feast for the eyes. It is not until you sit and look up at the ceiling that you are able to see the extent of the beauty of this restaurant. The dining area is split in two, divided by an elaborate hallway with the bar located at the back. The floor just below boasts a large room available for groups, and is equally exquisitely decorated. Including the elaborately designed washroom doors.Now that we have had a feast for our eyes, it was time to wet our whistles. The drink of the month was the Robin Hood, an exotic twist on the Dark and stormy. So how could we resist. We also sampled the mango mojito. As mojitos go, it was one of the best ones we have ever tasted.Having enjoyed our libations and viewed the entire restaurant, our excitement was building. How good would the food be? Well we were about to find out. Our first dish was the yellow fin tuna tartar, served with avocado and mango salsa, it was a spicy and sweet and divine.This is Montreal, so it is never a surprise to be served a twist on the traditional Quebec dish, poutine. Ours  was a lamb madras poutine, house cut french fries, topped with a Madras curry gravy, served over lamb and topped with cheese curds. Yes, it tasted as delicious as it sounds. Next came the naan pizza topped with figs, paneer and basil, light and tasty, it was the most unique pizza we have ever had the privilege to try.Our next two plates arrived together, the goat vindaloo, we were so excited about this dish we almost missed the Mediterranean sea bass. Both the offerings were accompanied by rice and naan bread. As we write this review, and are thinking back to these dishes, the taste, the spices, the perfect fusion of ingredients, our words cannot do justice to these marvelous creations. You truly have to try them to know you are tasting perfection. Finally, time for our favorite part of dinning, dessert. We know, how could we possibly eat anything else after such an exquisite meal. The question is, how could we not? Creme brulee made with kulfi (an Indian ice cream). It was the only way to finish such a meal.We would like to thank Rex Patel and the amazing staff at Rasoi for an interesting adventure into a unique twist on Indian cuisine. Be sure to join the crew for Ladies night on Wedensdays, we recommend reservations as it fills up fast and deservedly so."

Everything was extremely bland - I thought this was an Indian restaurant? Drinks were underwhelming and 85% ice. The decor is tacky (although the ceiling is cool). There is this weird partition with holes in it, great for customers waiting for their tables to stare at you while you enjoy an intimate dinner! And then the bill came! Not only was it extremely overpriced, we had to wait forever to pay the server - by that time we really wanted out of there!

Being referred to as guys, fellas, boys, gents and les gars by a waiter who is ten years younger than the youngest at table, ca fait mal. Being asked 'How about starting with some appys boys?' brought to mind the worst chain restaurants and this brand of overly familiar service persisted until he was too embarassed even to come to the table because the drinks and then the food took forever. The food: over priced, overwrought,  unimaginative, tepid and unfulfilling.This place was so bad the hashtags on display on many of the surfaces in the dining room almost inspired three non-twitterers to open twitter accounts just to be able to trash the place.If you live in St Henri spend the money on a cab, go up to Jean Talon, eat like a king, get in another cab to come home and still come out on top."

/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've wanted to review this place for a while, but I kept holding off because my experiences have varied so widely that I was never quite sure where I stood. When I've eaten in I've found the food to be quite good and fresh tasting, although the service was slow. (The last time I went we waited 45 minutes for our dinner.) However, I've had take-out now a few times, and each time the food has gotten worse. The onion bhajis are delicious in-house, but when we order for pick-up, they're extremely dry and old tasting. It has honestly left me wondering if they serve different food for take-out. Day-old bhajis? I can only speculate on the reason, but the last batch I ordered was so terrible I ended up throwing half of them out. Now the other dishes were tasty enough that I was still planning on returning to Rasoi (while refraining from ordering any more bhajis) when I found a piece of meat in the vegetarian dish I was eating. While this might not sound like a huge deal, to me it's indicative of a bigger problem. Does Rasoi claim to serve vegetarian/vegan meals while cooking them on unwashed equipment where they also cook meat? Is the restaurant so sloppy that someone else's food ended up in mine? I can deal with a lot of restaurant shortcomings, including slow service and a couple of mediocre dishes, but cross-contamination (due to presumably unwashed cookware) points to a lack of respect for the customer, and that's the last straw for me. Unfortunately, Rasoi has lost a couple of regular customers, and if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies or are concerned about knowing what's in your food, I would also encourage you to think twice about eating here."

It's an eclectic menu with freshly prepared food a friendly, chill vibe. We went for an early-ish dinner (6PM) so it wasn't too crowded and were able to snag an outdoor table. The mango salad was terrific (but be warned: even though the menu says it comes with tuna, what they don't tell you is that they charge you an extra $6 unless you tell them you don't want it). Nice curries, freshly cooked naan, great appetizers too. Definitely worth a stop here. Be patient tho -- the food takes awhile (cause it's fresh!).

The music was very nice too and at  the right volume. Ordered cocktails and was immediately drawn to Hot Lips for its spicy ingredients. But alas, it fell short on both punch and bite. Ordered 4-5 bunch of typical indian appetizers and they were all pretty good. Followed up with typical indian main courses. Overall the food is best described as 'indian food for beginners'  Flavors were muted and kept very conservative. Not very spicy nor very imaginative, but good healthy sized portions and we left satisfied. Finished off with the Gulab Jaman. No, not the best indian food you will have, but a good place to take the unitiated for a nice evening out. You want the real deal and authentic flavors go elsewhere. But this was a decent spot for a casual meal. Not cheap, but a pleasant dinner spot with introductory Indian cuisine."

We had a $35 4 course fixed menu. I knew we were off to a bad start when one of the group members showed up late and missed the first course.. and the servers refused to serve her the food she missed. Oh sorry, or she could PAY EXTRA to get the first course. We are talking about an onion bahji here... One little fried appetizer! Would it have been a trouble for them to bring it to her? Absolutely not. Service is off to a great start. From there things just went from bad to worse. The time between courses was a good 20-30 minutes, and the portions were oh so small! For a table of 4, we were served 3 pieces of shrimp. Three. When we inquired about the missing shrimp, we were told it was not missing. You only get 3 shrimp for 4 people, and 4 shrimp for 6 people... What!!! We were served lots of bland vegetables to fill in space. Finally we got the naan pizzas.. they were very tasty, but once again very small and not enough food. When we complained this time, the manager agreed to bring us an extra pizza. Wow finally doing something to accommodate! The curry dishes were good but by this time (I had probably been at the restaurant for almost 3 hours now), everyone was just pissed and it was hard to enjoy the meal. All the servers were so rude. It is unfortunate because the food is actually delicious but I will NEVER go back due to the extremely poor service.. these people don't know how to treat customers. Of course then we were forced to tip well thanks to the service being included as we were a group... thanks for stealing more of my money!!"
