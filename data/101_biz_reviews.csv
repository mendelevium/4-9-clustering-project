/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"If your food is cheap, fast and mouth-wateringly delicious, you're getting 5 stars. If it hits all those criteria AND the service is incredible, you get an additional star emoji . I've never been upset with the food here, but the katsu steals the show. Honestly though, you'll be happy no matter what you order."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place truly is as cute as a button. I'm additionally in outright awe of the two-woman show that was their Friday lunch rush today. The cook in me almost wanted to jump in and help them out but I know I wouldn't be able to keep up with the elderly lady power hour that is Haru Hana at lunch time. With that, I'll mention, be patient with the service- it's slow but worth it.As other reviewers have mentioned, this place really excels with its affordability. The surrounding neighbourhood is kinda hit or miss when it comes to cheap eats and drinks so they really shine in that department.As for the eats, I'll agree that it was super tasty. The takoyaki my brother and I shared was perfectly plated and absolutely delicious otherwise. That being said, I'm not sure the bulgogi rice bowl blew my mind like other Korean places in Mtl. As a regular of Japote perhaps my standards for affordable Asian plates is too high but I think Haru Hana could up their game a smidgen.All things considered, I will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had seen this come up on my Yelp searches for a while and I finally decided to try it because I realized it's super close to where I live. The menu had so many things on it that I love it was hard to choose! There's a lot of Korean/Japanese dishes that are my favorite kinds of comfort food for the cold weather and the prices are reasonable. My favorite thing we ordered was the ddeokbokki (rice cakes) with cheese and tonkatsu. My Korean roommate in college use to make ddeokbokki with cheese for me, but I've actually never seen it in a restaurant. Super good, great flavor and the tonkatsu was perfect (even after bringing it home because it was takeout.)I also got the Japanese ramen with pork which was good although a little small for me. There wasn't hardly any broth (not even enough to cover the noodles/toppings when I poured it into a bowl) but the flavor was good. The noodles reminded me more or less the same as instant ramen.The last thing we shared was the Oyakodon (chicken/egg/rice bowl) which also had good flavor but was a bit oversalted. A good portion of chicken and egg though. My to-go order was prepared very quickly and i would definitely come here again!"
/user_details?userid=aHkn3tnOEyA1grHpcDZEew,Sharon L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Small place and they verbally said that menu changed.The food tasted like premaid. I received spicy noodle when asked for non spicy and the rice dish lack flavour. My sister had to add soya sauce in the rice. The dumplings tasted frozen and bought from the store. Service was slow since there was only 2 ppl. Most food cost under $15. I didn't see any Asian people set foot in this Japanese restaurant while we were there for almost 47 minutes. Makes you wonder....

/user_details?userid=sLhx_e9CveYKWQXUzUeCfg,Sunshine M.,"Northern California, CA",2 star rating,"Close to my air BnB. Read reviews and was certain it would be a filling, tasty lunch. Small, clean space. Immediately sat and was able to give order. The portion size was decent, the quality of meat ( chicken) was not enticing in the least. It looked like chicken parts rather than chicken slices. The cost was not worth it. Paid 17.25 CAD for that and a pop. Would not come back. A place like this should have a lunch menu. I would have paid maybe 7.00CAD  oh well. And your coat will smell like the place too - ugh"

/user_details?userid=LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg,Kathy H.,Hong Kong,5 star rating,"suuuuuper delicious food!!! It's a small and cozy restaurant with friendly staff. It's so nice to run away from the rush hour crowds. The food is gooooooooooooood. Ok I don't know traditional Korean food, Haru Hana is just delicious and I love coming back.Jigae / stew:Dak bokkeum tang is the spicy chicken stew but it tastes more like vegetable soup, with a few pieces of dry chicken. It isn't spicy but it's very good.Budae jjigae is the beef stew with gochujang broth. Lots of sausages, rice cake, and quite spicy!! And the ground beef is gathered in a small ball. I like this one!Meat + rice:Grilled pork shoulder is soooooooooooo good. It comes with a different sauce on the side, but the pork was just so good by itself! I didn't finish the sauce so I added it in the gochujang soup and drank it.Ohsam bulgogi is pork and grilled calamari with gochujang sauce. There wasn't a lot of calamari but the pork was nice!!"
/user_details?userid=HPtNvEBZTZzD6XhNMSdWEA,Andrea A.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try this weekend because it looked tasty and affordable. I'm really glad we did, because we never would have found it otherwise! We were one of only two couples there at 8pm on a Saturday evening. Really cute interior with hip metal chairs + cushions, neat lighting, and a TV playing K-pop music videos.The menu was mostly Korean with some Japanese stuff, and some that were a mix. I decided on one of these: bulgogi ramen -- the server warned me it would be spicy, and I nodded enthusiastically. Andrew tried the bibimbap. Our food came out quite quickly and was super duper delicious! We frequently traded bowls so we could try bites and slurps of each other's food. The bibimbap had a nice selection of veggies and the sauce was just spicy enough to make our mouths water. The ramen broth was soooooooooo good, not too much meat, and the portions for each dish were just right.The trilingual server made friendly conversation in English while he was ringing us up, and seemed really pleased to hear that we'd found the place through Yelp! We were really happy to have found this place and will have to try other dishes from their menu when we return!"
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been there quite a few times already for lunch. I always order their Chicken Katsu with rice cakes (11.50 tax included) for takeout. The price is reasonable. Simply love it. It is a bit spicy but bearable. The staff are koreans. Lovely people. The place is small, could fit around 15 people. But I definitely recommend it for a quick meal!"
/user_details?userid=F5P_YyFeucqKu00lmJJHIg,Steve S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here a few times and had a chance to try a few of their menu items and have to say that this tiny little resto is a hidden gem. So shhhhhhhhhhhh !!.. keep it to yourself because I don't like waiting in line to get in ;-)Among other dishes, I've tried the bibimpap (yum!), soondubu jjigae (fantastic!), okonomiyake (very good!), ramen soup and the best Dak Galbi and have been thrilled each and every time. The staff is friendly and polite, the dude at the cash has a memory of an elephant so don't be surprised if he remembers you and what you had last time, the restaurant is quaint and the service is quick. They even have a counter that overlooks the street for lone wolfs looking to get a quick meal at lunch. Bottom line, this is good honest food, fast and cheap, so if you have a hankering for kimchi then swing on by, you won't regret it and who knows you may become a regular. As for me, would I go back? Well, I've already checked in 4 times, so chances are pretty good !"
/user_details?userid=-Yb1srF4RYtpn-6Yp8ojRg,A A.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Best Korean food quality and prep in a small family owned setting at very reasonable prices.  Place is nondescript but very clean and friendly English speaking staff.We have paid 3x as much for 1/2 the quality of what we got here.A good find near ste catherine which is never easy.
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",2 star rating,"This is a review of take out, the food quality wasn't great nor were the flavours. I decided to order the Rice cakes with chicken Katsu which was labeled spicy. Didn't feel the spice nor was the sauce that flavourful, was kinda disappointed after seeing the great reviews on here. My friends ordered the Jigae stew with bulgogi and complained that the bulgogi was of really bad quality and very chewy."
/user_details?userid=WSS_IdtIg42NvpxF7_jvJw,Jonny T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious superb homemade food at its best. This hidden little gem was a great find. There is very little seating space and food does take long if this place is full luckily on a Thursday evening at 6pm the place was quiet but started to get busy. We ordered the Katsu tempura menchies thing and ramen korean spicy. The flavouring was so good. They try to give best service just remember there's only one server and one cook food takes long but worth it they closed weekends which kinda let down I was hoping to eat here everyday during my trip overall great food and I can tell it was favoured as there was a lot of take out and foodara orders. Highly recommended.

/user_details?userid=sXiyLWpfhSzKcvjkfVk5jg,April K.,"Downey, CA",5 star rating,"I am from California. I stayed in downtown Montreal for 10 days with my baby during my husband's business trip. My 17 months old baby was not eating much since he has been eating mainly Korean food at home. I searched for Korean food on Yelp and found this place and decided to walk from Hyatt Regency hotel. I want to say it was 20 minutes of walk. Or less. I donno. I also stopped by the Fountain Park.I got to this place with a stroller and a kind looking lady opened the door for me so i can bring the stroller in. I immediately ordered a soy bean paste soup called DenJangJJiKye. I asked the lady to make it super mild since my baby was going to eat this.She brought in a miso soup for my baby to taste. I thought that was very kind of her. She then brought rolled up egg for my baby to win over the waiting time. Unfortunately he is allergic to eggs so i had to refuse but that was very nice of her to offer. My baby literally finished one full bowl of rice with soup. Yes one bowl. A 17 months old baby. I tasted the soup and it was pretty good. Californians are known to be spoiled with many varieties of foods. You can pretty much get anything you want within 5 minutes vicinity; good ones, too. Maybe i did not expect too much but it was pretty good. Could be better tho, but it did the job for my baby and thats all i needed. This lady was super nice and I would totally go back if I get to visit again."

It was a struggle to pick something from the menu because everything looked so GOOD. In the end, we went for japchae, a pork belly bun, and the chicken katsu with cheese tteokbokki. The food was excellent! Super flavorful mmmmm. I look forward to trying more of their dishes!"
/user_details?userid=qUqyWV4DnxEChu1xk24DqA,Melissa A.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We found this place thanks to Yelp but were a little bit worried on arrival as the one guy manning the cash register, the delivery orders, and the dining room seemed pretty overwhelmed. It was just him and a couple of ladies in the kitchen, and he was pretty backed up with orders. He pointed us to a table and served us some water and then was running around for a while, and just when we thought about leaving, he came by to take our order.I'm so glad we stayed as the food was excellent. I ordered the Doenjang Jjigae beef stew and my husband got the chicken katsu and both of us really enjoyed our meals. Our orders came pretty promptly considering the initial chaos, and once things calmed down a bit, we even had a pleasant chat with the waiter. The restaurant is pretty small so if you dine in, you will smell like food when you leave, but it was worth it for us. The prices are really reasonable. We'd eat there again for sure."

And that's what makes it so special. The proof is in the pudding, or, the broth rather. I had the spicy pork ramen, and I am shocked that something so spicy could still end up tasting so delicious."

The food was tasty and authentic in a fusion sort of way.  We liked the meat bun which is like a modified burger.  The food is well prepared and reasonably priced.  If you want to try Korean influenced Asian menu, I'd check them out."
/user_details?userid=-PHnbrru-P8IdlP5ZUd2cQ,Eric G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Let's resume the facts:Really small restaurant. About 4 tables of 4 to sit plus some individuals places. Might not be a restaurant to bring your many friends.Food portion very small compare to competition but the price is also lower. Be ready to be hungry.But the main problem for us was the enormous quantity of salt put in the dishes. We took the Japanese ramen with Tonkutsu soup and I just could not eat the soup. Same thing with the teriyaki rice bowl. The bibimbap was deceiving cause it wasn't fried in the oven and the beef inside seemed boiled.Well, we had some anticipation regarding the reviews but we were deceived by the place."

/user_details?userid=7qd7-O3BfEfdk0x80QjeFQ,Elston F.,"Singapore, Singapore",5 star rating,"Found this place through Yelp, and it was great! Visited with a party of 11, and the host gladly reserved our places at last minute. Great service, though there's only one banchan (kimchi) available, they were willing to refill it for us.Food was super delicious, we tried the Grilled Pork Shoulder with Ssamjang, Spicy Pork with Calamari, Budaejigae as well as the Bulgogi (beef). Silence ensued thereafter as we couldn't stop taking another bite.Ultimately, we think the Spicy Pork with Calamari was still the best; the pork and calamari surprisingly contrasted each other in terms of texture and taste and was well received. The Budaejigae is also noteworthy, with the broth deliciously thick and savory, and just the right level of spiciness, with generous amounts of fish cakes, rice cakes, spam and hotdogs. Portion sizes are good for one, but becomes a stretch to share between two, as is typical of most Asian restaurants. Also, the restaurant has a seating capacity of 16, so large groups above 7-8 are recommended to reserve."

/user_details?userid=8iqeLIRe-eIlcnewuYGFPQ,Steven S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Some unconventional food items compared to the typical Montreal Korean resto.  Highlights for me are the Szechaun Tteokbokki and Kimchi Bibim Guksu (Spicy Cold Noodles). They have some Japanese menu items thrown into the mix. I enjoyed their okonomiyaki.  It's a real mom and pop shop, with the son working the counter. Very reasonable prices, friendly service and tasty food.  They're accommodating with substitutions, so some menu items are easily adapted for vegetarians."
/user_details?userid=ZuvNUKYZKWLRD4xuX84j5Q,Cathy N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went there 'cause of all the great reviews but was not THAT impressed. I had the shrimp steamed buns and the seafood pancake. The buns looked really cute and I liked the fact they made fried shrimp patties instead of simply putting whole shrimps in the buns. There was something off about the taste, though. The seafood pancake was meh, it was kinda mushy and not that tasty. I had better korean pancakes at other places. It was not a bad experience but I'd rather go to Ganadara !"

There were no mistakes in the order, and the owner even threw in some dumplings, which were FANTASTIC! What we tried: Dak Bokkeum Tang (Spicy Chicken Stew) My FAVOURITE! The chicken was fall off the bone tender, and the broth was amazing. There were potatoes and carrots as well, to thicken the stew. Spicy Pork/Spicy Chicken- also great. It is the same sauce for both. Tender meat, typical Korean sauce- not that spicy, but still tasty. They came with a soup, kimchi and a small omelette. Overall a fairly large portion. You wont be hungry!Dumplings- were awesome. quite tasty, especially the sauceAlso, The owner was very friendly, and the delivery was prompt.

The egg & dumplings that came in the tteokbokki were awesome and the kimchi jjigae had pretty good flavor. The price was right, though I'll probably try a different spot next time."

The soup was very flavourful and the chicken extremely tender. The bokkeum udon had gret texture, very chewy and satisfying. We plan to order from here for our next party so we can try more menu items. The kind service made our experience even more enjoyable! Highest recommendation, you wont be disappointed!"
