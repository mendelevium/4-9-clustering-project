/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"I really enjoyed this place ! The food was outstanding everything was so delicious and fresh . We wanted to order one of everything on the menu because it all sounded so good. Finally we decided to order cheese cigares, fattoush salad and kefta and all three items were perfect , we couldn't stop talking about how good everything was. Decor is comfortable and casual (social distancing measures well put in place), our server was really friendly and helpful in providing suggestions and knowledgeable about the menu. The prices were fair ( I would recommend ordering a few dishes to share). I already can't wait to keep coming back to try all their other amazing sounding dishes ! Highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Figuring out what you enjoy from their menu is key. I very much enjoy their Fattet Makdous. The regular version is delicious and the vegetarian version while less tasty is still quite enjoyable. I recommend both! Bonus points before this stays good even if delivered. The fattouche salad is good, but I've had better. The beetroot moutabal, mouhammara and kefta mechoui weren't great imo. I'll keep exploring however as the Fattet Makdous was so good that I will order from there again! If I can find a winning set of plates, I'll update this review!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Found this spot on Yelp! We went there on a busy day without reservations. They were kind enough to accommodate us after a short wait at the bar. The servers are friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the Fattet Dajaj which is Pulled chicken and rice. And three dips to share with Pita Bread. The taste of the food and quality of ingredients is excellent. The restaurant has a nice warm ambiance and feel good vibe! We were pleasantly surprised by our experience and will definitely be coming by again.
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried this place out and it was better than I thought! Adam and I didn't go for a full meal, we only wanted a consistent snack and that's exactly what we got here. We got some pita bread (they were out of naan), some hummus kawarma, labne, and mini potatoes. We got so much more than expected, the quantities are very generous. Everything was very good. Filling and tasty, I really enjoyed the hummus kawarma. It was the first time I tried that kind of hummus.The pita bread was very normal though so try to order the naan bread if you're looking to get some sauces and share. The potatoes were also pretty normal, not too seasoned so perfect to pair with the sauces but you get A LOT. Enough for 5 people honestly. They are also cut pretty thick.Service was quick (but we were the only people there) and seating is comfortable. It's also a medium sized restaurant.Overall really great. Will go back for dinner."
/user_details?userid=E5nRF4bClGRgpo9JeCHfqg,Suganya H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I came here for a late night dinner. They have nice ambience so if u want to have fine dinner around that area. Their service was good. Food was good. Nothing to complain atleast. I tried their walnut pomegranate and it was okay. Baba ghanoush was good too. Pita was good. Lamb something was good too. Everything tasted fresh.
/user_details?userid=98tGZx0-iCkQrGCksnp-Xg,Kimberly L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"One of my favorite meals I've had in Montreal! We ate outside during sunset on their patio, splitting a bottle of wine and stuffing ourselves silly with hummus, baba ganoush, shaved filet mignon, grape leaves and lamb. The Greek wine we ordered on a whim was incredible, complimenting every dish perfectly. Every single dish we ordered was put together with such care and interesting little details, like pomegranate seeds on the baba ganoush. Highlight was the lamb shank, which was tender and spiced to perfection. Can't wait to return to Montreal so I can make my way back here."

However, the prices are not reasonable especially that the food portions are very little. I liked the taste but wasn't very special, some dishes are better than others. I like the area and I liked the ambiance, I would recommend it for couples that would like to enjoy a small and expensive bite. Enjoy it and you be the judge."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A group of us have been wanting to try this Syrian/Lebanese resto for some time so we finally made our reservations using OpenTable. We had no issues getting our table at the right time and the entire process was painless. Love having my reservations being respected! This is a small establishment of about 50 interior seats and can get quite loud when it starts to fill out. They do have a terrace if you're into that kind of thing as well.Sitting down we were served the traditional plate of fresh pita as well as olive/peppers. Menu is somewhat limited but they stick to their specialties and I totally respect that! We shared a bottle of champagne to celebrate an event and decided to order 5-6 hot/cold mezze dishes along with 2 of their lamb kebbe main meals. I would have liked a bigger main meal to share, perhaps with filet mignon.The fattouch salad was honestly one of the BEST fattouch salads I've EVER eaten... and I've eaten my fair share of these!! It had the acidity I crave and the pomegranate seeds made it bitter sweet... it was perfect. I definitely went for seconds and maaaaaybe even thirds and found myself ready to fight the other people at my table for more!""Fite me""Another item I really liked was the Akkawi (cheese) rolls. They were perfect! Crunchy on the outside and some and flavorful on the inside.The Kibbe was just OK. They seemed harder (perhaps overcooked). Taste just wasn't there. Shame.The hummus was great, lots of flavor and went sooooo nicely with the smooth fresh pitas. Yummy time!The side potatoes were quite disappointing. Completely lacked flavor and some slices were a undercooked. Needed salt. Not worth the calories.Out of the 2 main meals we collectively preferred the Kabab Bil Karaz over the Mechoui.  The Kabab Bil Karaz is simmered in a delicious sweet cherry sauce garnished with pine nuts and it really brought out the meat's flavors. The mechoui plate paled in comparison.For dessert I had their atayef (ricotta based crepe in a rose water honey) and it was just OK. They come in a pair and I'd rather have had just the one instead of two tiny bites. The atayef dessert was dry and could have definitely used more rose water honey.The coffee was Turkish style. Made to be shared in pairs.Service started off great but as the place got busy completely fell off. Very friendly however and helpful.Really liked my experience at Kazamaza and would see myself go back.... THAT FATTOUCH."

Was very embarrassed and upset by how rude and unfriendly the staff was to them. The store owner actually stopped us on the way out to complain about the tip, even though we had actually tipped despite the slow and unfriendly service. Have never had such hostile service at a restaurent before."

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I recently tried out this lebanese/syrian resto located on Parc Avenue and must say I truly loved their dishes. The resto itself  has a warm homey ambiance feeling to it..kind of felt like we were eating over at someone's house. The resto itself is small but could accomodate a group of 12 people max. Service is friendly. Now for the food...simply delicious and authentic! Packed with lots of flavor and truly enjoyed the wonderful combination of spices. Loved the humus, lamb, lamba pita and eggplant dishes and of course their kibbe!  They also have a tasting menu of entrees which gives people a chance to taste their delicious dishes. Great way to discover.....every bite was mouther-watering. The resto does have parking in back of resto but street parking is free after 6pm on Saturday nights.  Great discovery !  Simply put great lebanese, syrian food all for reasonable prices!"
/user_details?userid=TIHyAJK7IwUQheBzEmg3Bg,Tameeka B.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"This was the first restaurant I tried on my first trip to Montreal. The staff members were so helpful and what they suggested was absolute divine. We were the first couple in the restaurant so we got a choice of seats. We were given warm pita bread and olives immediately which was what we needed on the very cold day we arrived in Montreal. We asked our waiter what he suggested since we'd just arrived and was in search for something warm and filling. Our waiter suggested we try a dish called Fattet Mawzat. The Fattet Mawzat is a warm dish containing lamb, eggplant, pine nuts, tomato sauce, and mind blowing spices. I don't know what it is but I love pine nuts in my food. They are just so flavorful. We tried the Labneh and the grilled chicken.The grilled chicken was very juicy and grilled.  The setting was very romantic (low lights and candles). It was the perfect way to welcome us to Montreal. I expected to eat only French cuisine while on my mini vacation but I would have never thought my first meal in this French city would be Middle Eastern and I loved every bite.Oh and we also tried some amazing beer named Boréale Rousse. Oh my goodness. This beer was red (yes I said the beer was red -- and no it's not like when we drink green beer for St. Patty's Day). This beer was mind blowing because of the caramel taste! This beer actually paired well with the warm dishes. I will also add that the food was not spicy. Many people think  middle eastern food tends to be spicy. The dishes we tried were not at all. I will definitely return here if we go back to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=2klL5Dfr11Uz8nhCa4AACA,Kelsey S.,"South Salem, NY",5 star rating,Delicious food and amazing service! We came from NYC and loved the whole experience. It felt very welcoming. We will be back next year! Definitely share a plate of hummus and save room for dessert.
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Cozy restaurant, friendly service, and good taste as well. Me and my friend shared both our dishes (they gave plates to share). We had lamb shanks with rice and yoghurt (~$22) and kofta with sour cherry sauce (~20). The portions were huge! We were more than done midway. I loved the kofta, beautiful flavours in the cherry sauce and the meat was tendered to perfection. The kofta was served with smoked wheat pita which has the texture of crispy nachos, really compliments the meal. The dish also comes with a side of rice. The lamb shanks was also good but the yoghurt was overwhelming for me and after couple of bites, I didn't feel like having more. If you're not big about the taste of Greek yoghurt, or sour yoghurt or just milk in genera, I'd strongly advice against choosing this dish. I liked the flavour of anar (pomegranate) in the dish and wish there was more of that. We also ordered desert (halwa) and I didn't like it that much. I just want to say though that I didn't like it simply because of my personal taste. The dessert was extremely sweet and chewy, glazed with more gooey sweet syrup. I didn't finish it because the entire concept of this dessert was a bit off for me. You might like it if you like the taste and texture of bubble gum.I'm giving the place 3 stars because I feel this is a promising place but my ordering might not have worked in my favour but I am definitely coming back here to give this restaurant another shot!"

We asked her what she wanted to eat and to which she replied Lebanese/middle eastern. So we decided to go to come here. Such a good choice! Everything we ordered was so good! From appetizers to main to desserts. We all shared various appetizers and i think that it was the best way on doing it. Like that, you get to try it all. As for the main, I ordered the kefta in grenadine and tahini sauce with rice. So much depth of flavours! My husband got the octopus. Braised and grilled to perfection! My cousin from Germany had the lamb. The meat fell right of the bone! The kibbé was very flavourful and the chicken really moist and tender!They have a small wine list and are not very well equipped for specialty cocktails. You can maybe have a gin and tonic but that's about it. I chose to go with a private importer a was really happy with my choice. Good service. Great ambiance. Delicious food! Very reasonably priced! Omg i fell in love all over again with this type of food! I will be coming back very soon."
/user_details?userid=LPOUJ-4EYvlJ-Qe8l-xAGw,G R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a nice place.  If you read my reviews, you know I avoid peak hours.  We chose 3 mezzes: Hummus, Mutabbal betteraves (beets) and Mousaqa'a.  All three were great, but the Mousaqa'a... amazing.  Tabboule salad but tabbouleh salad - fresh ingredients.  Baqaqat was hot, crisp and the right amount of cheese melt inside.  I love a good tartar and perhaps I am not used to the cultural preparation differences, but this was my least favourite dish of the night.  I felt it needed more seasoning and textures. The white fish was amazing - do flavourful.Very friendly service - highly recommend. No room for coffee or dessert, we were so full!  Will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have to say that compared to so many other middle eastern restaurants I have been to in Montreal, KazaMaza is quite average. I have been here twice and both times their service was ok. Also, their lamb shank portions are quite small. My friends who ordered the dish were still hungry. Plus, their chicken dish sells out quite fast so make sure you let them know your choice when calling to reserve a table. Lastly, for a middle eastern restaurant of this standard, they don't serve fresh pita bread."

Went to Kazamaza for the second time for a birthday celebration expecting the same high quality food and experience, and unfortunately was extremely disappointed! This restaurant was amazing when I visited it in 2015, i gave them a glowing review on yelp then but unfortunately it went downhill since then! Upon arrival we were served the traditional olives and pita bread...we were a party of 5 and were served exactly 5 olives...really? Are olives that expensive these days? We ordered 4 meze plates...hummus, mouhammara, vine leaves and baba ghanouj...the only decent one was the mouhammara, the rest tasted like they just came out of a can!For the main dish I ordered the mowzat frikih with yoghurt...the meat was ok but was burned at the bottom and the tiny side yoghurt was barely enough for the dish! No one enjoyed the tiny portions! Never coming back to this restaurant and don't recommend it all! There's lots of great middle eastern restos in Montreal, spend your money elsewhere!"

Baba Ghannouj was the best thing we had, nice and smokey. The fattouche salad was sweet and forgettable. The kefta mechoui had absolutely no flavour,, none, zero!!  We also had the fattet makanek  this was a bit better. Minced lamb in a rich tomato sauce with tahini and crispy pita chips. The textures were great but again there was no flavours.  All these dishes are usually prepared with exotic middle eastern spices, creating yummy and flavourful foods.....NOT HERE. The service was also pretty weak. A big disappointment!!!!"
/user_details?userid=oAhoFRRKomodbIx8jtKmKA,Kerry J.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal, you are so lucky to have this restaurant. Great sit down Lebanese/Syrian restaurants that go beyond shawarma are hard to find. Everything I had was fantastic. And believe me, I sampled a large portion of the menu. Fattoush - beyond words. This is an incredibly flavorful dish that will leave you wondering how a salad upstaged the rest of your meal. Not to be missed.Baba Ganoush - Smokey eggplant dip topped with sweet and sour pomegranate seeds. So many great flavor a married together. Mouhamara - red pepper, walnuts, breadcrumbs ground together into a delicious dip Moussa'qa - eggplant and peppers stewed together in a tomato sauce and served cold topped with lebnah- a thick sour cream that is hard to stop eating Fried Kibbeh - crispy fried bulgur wrapped around ground meat and nutsKefta in pomegranate tahini sauce - served over rice, the sauce is to die for Service was friendly and attentive as well. The atmosphere is non pretentious but still a nicer restaurant, perfect for a date or meeting up with a group of friends (lots of dishes meant to be shared with a group). By 9 pm on a Saturday it was full save for one or two tables plus people waiting. Seriously, if you are curious about middle eastern food, Kaza Maza will make you a fan."
/user_details?userid=VMkgroLgf4dMPAyrwTgJIQ,Tom F.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"This is some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had. Standouts include the fattouche and the fattet makdous. The latter, particularly, was incredible. The fattouche looks plain but bursts with spice and herb. The negatives were that our server was quite unenthusiastic, and that the baklava was far too dry. Still, I enjoyed the meal greatly."

We reserved via OpenTable for a Tuesday evening. Luckily we did!! as we were a large group (8 adults plus 2 children). To our surprised, the restaurant was pretty full for a Tuesday evening. We were seated at the back of the restaurant which was perfect, we had our little corner to ourself. The restaurant felt like home and cozy.Plenty of paid parking on the street, but also saw on their website they have available parking spots at the back of the restaurant. Baby friendly place (but to be on the safe side, preferably reserve high chairs if needed as they only have 2 available).From the menu, we ordered an entree along with 2 main meals per couple. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures... but you can refer to previous postings to confirm the portions they served were really generous! I ordered the mouhammara spread (with unlimited pitas) and the lamb kefta with eggplants. It was delicious!!!!! Loved the few bites of pistachios crunchiness inside the kefta. The next morning we were still talking about the restaurant how it was a good find, with good food and would definitely recommend and return."

We shared 5 mezzes, 2 salads and 6 main courses. Personally, I think the fattouche at this restaurant is the best. It is not too salty or sour, it is seasoned perfectly. We had a lot of lamb courses. Everyone agreed that the cherry simmered lamb dish was the best, along with the mechoui. The friki and fattet makdous came in second. Our non red meat eaters said the garlic chicken and sea bass dish were really good too. As we left, we noted that the neighbouring table ordered lamb chops that looked really tasty too! It is now on my list of things to try for next time. With the amount of food we ordered, we were stuffed! I could see why people say the service is slow. There are very few waiters for a full house ( and it seems to always be full). We arrived before the crowd and was served before the restaurant became packed, so we thought the service was great! I would definitely return with big groups of friends in the future!"

Everything tasted good, it just felt a little overpriced for the quantity served. Lamb Kefte and braised lamb were delicious - as were the salads and all the dips in the apps.  The most recent time there was so much oil in the dishes - there much have been half an inch of oil in the round ramekin at the end - that it did not feel good. Only if someone told me this had changed, would I return. Actually - that's not true. I'd probably give it another shot as it really was great the first few times. I would just order carefully or ask about the oil content!That's my piece of advice to you too if you go!"

A pomegranate vinaigrette made it sing. Fatter Makdous is a layered eggplant, ground lamb, yogurt and crispy pita dish and taste even better than it sounds. But the real star of the show is the Mutabbal Betteraves. A Mediterranean beet dip that reminds you of hummus... But I really can't do justice with words. It's a must have dish.

We were lucky to get a table without reservations because we noticed that most tables had a reserve sign and the place filled up quickly. The restaurant is so cute and homey with brick walls. We shared the lamb shank braised in yogurt and tahini. The meat fell off the bone.  It was so good!! We also shared the garlic shrimp. The shrimps were big and let's be real... anything garlic is amazing! The dishes came with a side of rice and pita bread. Everything was delicious! We got a half bottle of house wine which was also pretty good. We shared a dessert (Aish el Saraya). It reminds me of baklava but doughy and you can really taste the rosewater. It was good and light!

The hummus and baba ghannoush ere bland and tasteless I had better canned hummus. The main course was more disappointing. We ordered kafta Karaz, the chicken, the frikeh lamb and the chicken fatteh. All portions were very small we were all still hungry. The lamb was burnt, dry and  chewy. The fatteh was very dry with little yogurt. The Kaftah Karaz was as bland and tasteless as the other dishes.

/user_details?userid=wAapkfuOdtIMajbFotOY5Q,Marie-Ange A.,"Paris, France",3 star rating,"I really didnt like the food, especially considering the price, but it's a question of flavor and personal preference. I've never had these flavors before, and it didnt help that the entrees I chose (Mouhamarra, mousaqaa, stuffed vines...) were all cold, which i was told is how they're served. The olives they brought as sides were really bitter, and the Kefta my friends ate were so so. They put cold salad on hot kefta, so everything ended up being kind of cold.Maybe it's enjoyable to eat cold cooked vegetables in Syrian heat but in Canadian winterish weather... Not my cup of tea. And the flavors, I just really did not enjoy them. Again, personal preference, but no one at my table took a liking to it. So warning, not for everyone.I still recommend it for date night or a group dinner. I like the mood lighting, and service is diligent. It's worth trying once, you might like it!"

Without trying them out, how would you guys know what it taste like?! We would just like to describe them simply: lamb was fork-tender and friki had good amount of spices which gave great flavors; and kefta had toasted pistachios & walnuts in the meatball with its shockingly delicious rich sauce. Fell in love with Syrian cuisine already..!The service was very good. We loved the waitress who talked like a good friend taking care of/sharing many things in life. One thing though, the restaurant got very busy after 9 pm and there was only one waitress, it was a bit too long to wait for the check. But anything was fine. We were truly pleased with the food and service by the time we were about to leave.Anyone out there who hasn't tried Syrian food! Please take a visit to Kaza Maza!"

I will definitely be back!The details: We decided to go here on a whim on a Wednesday night. The restaurant is in what feels like a formerly residential space, which gives it a cozy/quaint vibe. There were a decent amount of people, but there was enough space for us to get a table. (There is a small bar area that I would have eaten at had there been no tables.) Right after we sat down, a server came by with water, a bowl of olives and peppers, and a candle. Just the right amount of cozy. Service was thorough and paced just perfectly so that we still had some of our remaining appetizer hummus by the time our main dishes arrived. Warm pita bread would have been amazing, but the room temperature pita was fine. We ordered the fattet makdous, which the waiter had said was delicious. And, holy moly, it was AMAZING. Layers of lamb, eggplant, and pita chips (who knew?!) with tahini and tomato sauce. Eat mouthfuls with a spoon, smear it onto pita bread, or stick it with a fork--any way you eat it, it's so good. We also got the kibbé labniyé, which are falafel-like balls stuffed with beef in a yummy tahini and yogurt sauce. We didn't order dessert because we were full to contentment. It was a great meal, and I will be back, especially in the winter for their stick-to-your-ribs dishes ."

Most options contain beef or shrimp which originally made me a little skeptical, because id say i am definitely one of those people who like sharing different dishes with the people I'm with, but all dishes can be served as a vegetarian option. Our waiter was extremely helpful and described the food extremely well and helped us make a decision based of of my little knowledge to middle eastern cuisine. But honestly, i  could've chosen anything off of that menu and have it be delicious. Definitely try the home made hummus and babagounoush which is out of this world. This place is a charming spot for a date or even a large party, for the space is well laid out and extremely quaint. Definitely worth a visit down du Parc. Oh yeah and cant beat the pita bread and olives tat compliment any dish you try!"

We decided to do this meal tapas-style and shared everything we ordered.  We started with a Lebanese Reserve red wine that was full of flavor and was an excellent combo with the food.  As an appetizer, we had the kibbe, which was a generous portion and cooked to perfection.  We moved on to an order of hummus and an order of baba ganoush.  I loved the hummus and my girlfriend loved the baba ganoush.  For our main, we got the fattet makdous, which was an eggplant dish with lamb crispy pita.  It was indescribable and equally amazing.  We probably got a bit too much food but it was so good I can't say I regret it at all.  I wish this place were in NYC so I could eat there regularly."

This time, we came for the brunch offered on weekends. Brunch comes with pita, pickles, coffee/juice, and a different menu- although normal menu is available too. The standout dishes were the baba ghanoush and fattouch salad. The bg came garnished with pomegranate seeds and parsley- it was vibrant and chunky. The roasted eggplant flavor beamed through in each bite. The fattouch salad was perfectly dressed. I particularly liked the scallions and thinly sliced radishes in the mix. We ordered two lamb dishes- my mom can't not have lamb when it is available- the brunch kawarma and one of the specialty keftas, the grenadine one. The kawarma was a ground lamb baked under eggs. The kefta was a little bit tougher than I remember it being the last time. Biggest complaint is that the entrees don't come with rice so we ordered it separately. Nevertheless, there was free flowing pita to sop up the sauce.And for non-French speakers, they offer an English menu!"

/user_details?userid=GYrZiRs9ARjsNzZMpGJHiw,Royce L.,"Ithaca, NY",3 star rating,"A friend and I came here today, as we were craving Syrian food. Damas (a few blocks away) is another Syrian place that he had been to before but it is only open for dinner so we decided to try something new.Food - the menu has quite a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We decided to start with a fattoush (Mediterranean salad with toasted pita chips) and a kibbe nayyeh which is essentially a Lebanese/Syrian version of beef tartare. The portions were both quite large considering we got the smaller versions of both appetizers. The salad was delicious (probably the peak of our meal) and the kibbe was alright. It lacked depth and complexity of flavor - probably needed to sit a bit longer with spices. For the mains, I am a big fan of kefta (lamb) and tart/sweet fruit sauces so I got the one that was cooked in a sour cherry sauce. There was also a pomegranate tahini sauce. It was very good. The meat was tender and it was paired perfectly with the side of rice that accompanied it. The flavours could have been a bit more complex and it felt like nutmeg overpowered the meat a bit, but overall it was very good. My friend got the braised lamb shank with friki (wheat) and while the meat was well cooked and tender, it was completely devoid of flavour. It had no seasoning or herbs and even the yogurt dipping sauce that came with it didn't help much. For being what seemed to be a special of the restaurant, it was quite disappointing. Service/Ambiance - We came in on a Sunday early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty much empty - there was only a family having lunch so we were seated quite promptly. The service was below average to average. Basically it seemed like he just really didn't care. He did answer our questions about the menu but that was the extent of our interaction. No one came by to check how things were tasting and it was a bit slow at the end to pay. The restaurant is pretty bare bones. It's a pleasant atmosphere but nothing extraordinary. It is a good casual place to grab food. It is a decent size so probably good for groups.Overall, we were left full and relatively satisfied with our meals. From what I have heard, Damas would have been a much better option, albeit at a higher price point. I don't think I would come back here but it was not an unpleasant experience. It is just that for what we paid, we could have had something much better elsewhere, considering the extensive choice of food from this area in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My enjoyment of Middle Eastern cuisine is a very recent occurrence. Part of that was never being exposed to it younger outside of bad shawarma at fast food joints. Hard to enjoy something when you've only known the bad stuff. My discovery of Sumac a few months ago peaked my interest in this cuisine and I'm now more inclined to try some stuff I perhaps wasn't previously. This came into play a few weeks ago when a friend of my girlfriend's invited us to a restaurant for what she called the best eggplant dish ever. The catch was she wouldn't tell us where we were going! The day of, she told us to meet her at Parc and Mont-Royal. Because I couldn't resisted guessing, I thought about possible restaurants nearby where an eggplant dish would be likely. My reasoning led me to Kaza Maza which is exactly where she brought us. I clearly have a little too much knowledge of Montreal restaurants at the moment!Kaza Maza is located on Parc Avenue in a non-descript brickhouse. The space is sparse but nice - very much in keeping with the neighborhood and the building itself. Brick walls, white crown moldings, old wood floors, an old fireplace, minimal artwork and some nice chandeliers. There is also a bar which is nice but because of the layout of the space, it is not really intregrated with the dining room.The menu is a variety of Middle Eastern dishes - most of which I had no clue about prior to entering the restaurant. As a starter, we went with a trio of spreads to go with some pitas. First was the mutabbal betteraves - roasted beet puree with tahini, yogourt, lemon and garlic. The vibrant pink colour of this dish is a clear indicator of just how much beet there is. I am not a beet fan generally speaking but I loved the flavour of this puree. Not overbearing in the least. The inclusion of the yogourt provided a nice smooth consistency.The second spread was the mouhammara - ground walnuts with bread crumbs, pomegranate molasses and spices. A grainier consistency than the previously one and a much different flavour profile as well. Much more nutty and spiced with that hint of sweetness from the pomegranate molasses. Very enjoyable.Our last starter was the one I already knew prior to this meal - Labneh. A thick yogourt, this was a rich, creamy and slightly sour spread that provided a perfect constrast to the other two.Once we finished off the spreads, our mains arrived. First we had the arrayes kefta - Grilled pita stuffed with spiced minced lamb served with hummus and pomegranate molasses. To me, this dish was a slight miss. Compared to what we had so far, this felt fad and lacked strong flavour which is a surprise given the use of spiced lamb.The grilled octopus with lentils was a much bigger success. The octopus was grilled perfectly....I simply wish there had been more! If that is my only complaint, you know the dish works well.The final main was the catalyst for the whole evening - The fattet makdous - layers of fried eggplant, crispy pita bread, yogourt tahini sauce, garlic tomato sauce, pine nuts and almonds. Yeah.... this is an excellent eggplant dish. The use of crispy pitas seems weird when you read it in the description but it works beautifully to add some crunch to the mix. The sweetness of the tomato sauce, the creaminess of the tahini sauce, the nuttyness of the almonds and pine nuts - all of it works well with the fried eggplant and makes this a very satifying dish. Is it the best eggplant dish in Montreal? Not willing to go that far but it's top of the list for now!For dessert, we had classic baklavas as well as. The baklavas, thankfully not drenched in honey, were just sweet enough without getting on my nerves - an issue I've always run into with baklavas. We also had what I believe to have been halawets - our waitress told us but I honestly forgot the name. Pretty good as well - once again, not too sweet and a nice creamy texture.Kaza Maza was a great meal and a wonderful introduction for me to new Middle Eastern dishes. In cases like this, it is always great when I can order a meal of almost entirely unknown dishes and have a great night. I know that Middle Eastern cuisine isn't everyone's cup of tea but I highly recommend you give Kaza Maza a try and yeah... don't forget the eggplant dish.Cheers!"

In a way you miss out because Lebanese tend to have this hospitable joyful nature in them, and they serve food with passion rather than a sense of duty. And in a way that's good and keeps the vibe more international-friendly and at decent volume- because the place is small for loud Lebanese laughing crowd :)Basically, it's the place to have great Lebanese food but not the total Lebanese experience, which worked very well for me and my friends.Everyone was mega impressed by the food.

All of the waitstaff we pleasant, friendly, and respectful, managing multiple tables and our orders with a good pace.The thing that blew my mind here was the food and two items in particular: the Baba Ganoush and the Pistachio Kibbe. Holy cow! These palate and mind-melting items when combined together on a piece of pita and chased with Arak took flavor to a new level. I've had a fair amount of very authentic Middle Eastern food on the east coast and in the U.A.E. and this is right up there with the best.

As did house wine offered in carafes. Bottles of wine are available too, but hey, if we're doing ""chill,"" let's do it all the way, n'est-ce pas?We started with lentil soup ($4/7) and hummus ($7). Both were unbelievably flavourful. The soup was fresh and not overcooked like many other lentil soups I've tried.  Instead, you could really taste the lentils, tomatoes, coriander, ginger, and bit of lemon and coconut. The hummus was delectably silken, and the chickpeas added a nice contrasting texture.Next came the spiced grilled chicken with garlic, lemon and Alep pepper and potatoes ($15), and the kefta kebab simmered in sour cherries and pines nuts ($19). So incredibly satisfying!These plates really confirmed what I love most about Middle Eastern cuisine - it uses simple, everyday ingredients to whip up dishes that are outstanding and bursting with flavour.And finally, you can't go Middle Eastern without having a taste of the sweet stuff. For dessert, we had the baklava. I wish it had had a little bit more rose water and honey ""coulis"", but nevertheless, it was tasty.

They also mentioned that there's often live music there! so needless to say we'll be back."
/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My first experience of Kaza Maza and its Syrian cuisine was very strong on the food end (fattet hummus!), but not so strong on the service end, but they were having a rough day and I recognized that (it happens). Recent experiences have been nothing but perfect (food and service both) and Kaza Maza quickly became one of my faves of 2010. Start with a selection of 3 or 5 of their phenomenal cold mezze, choose a fattet hummus from among the hot mezze, and go from there. Outstanding.  Friendly, too.  Live music from time to time."

/user_details?userid=6_5x4RTje4bCHkGubDDTew,Haseeb T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really good food. Unique taste. Fattoush and the eggplant/yogurt dish was delicious. Lamb shank was a bit dry. Will definitely go back though to try other dishes
/user_details?userid=jLrjTYY8TZHXMmDdc7rMuA,Philippe M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Absolutely delightful. The Chef offers a  great twist on lebanese/syrian cuisine. The ambiance is laid back.We had a great time.
/user_details?userid=JmmHazeMd1YjuPCTjisvPQ,Paige K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Went here for my birthday this year, and after having lived a year in Lebanon and tasting what I thought was the best Lebanese food ever, I was totally humbled.  This was in fact, the most delicious Mediterranean food I've ever had, of any genre, hands down.  As a semi-vegetarian (fish only), there were tons of options for me, each one yummier than the next.  I was floored by the Fattoush, then had this brilliant looking purple mezze called Mouhammara, which I'd never experienced before.  The Baba Ganoucj, Hummus, Eggplant dish and Salmon were divine, and though I left having over-eaten, it was a good-full feeling, as all of the ingredients were fresh and natural.  The atmosphere was relaxed, yet sophisticated.  If I lived in Montreal, it would be my regular spot."
/user_details?userid=YsD8bQt0IWCCGZeHXQiIuQ,Max K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to KazaMaza for our wedding anniversary.  I Ioved that there were lots of vegetarian choices.  Could have made my entire meal with the starters (in fact, the veggie choices were all in the starters).  I chose an additional starter as my main dish.  The hummus was especially good.  Was looking forward to baklava for dessert but they were out of it.  Tried a ""pudding"" instead.  It was a kind of semoule - new to me and very good.  The waiter was a busy guy but humored us in our several requests.  We had only one complaint, which is that the pita was cold and rubbery.  I usually love pita but I did not even eat this one after the first bite.  Bottom line:  I will be back."
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A bit pricey for what you get, noisy as hell, inconsiderate and spotty service. I truly don't understand the appeal. The food is good, but other than that... Would definitely not recommend."
/user_details?userid=5dCiti8ieP0QpdB3e03hLw,Stephanie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"I've gone twice and I'll go again. The variety of lamb shanks is great and super tasty (especially the one with eggplant), the kafta was really great too. Only thing is they put way too much onions on everything, so if you don't love them, warn the servers! The fattoush salad is perfect. The place gets busy and very noisy, so if you have sensitive ears it might not be the best place for you."
/user_details?userid=8lGPfe06mgEtvROds5fAlA,N H.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Great atmosphere and good food. And best of all, they have their own private parking lot behind the restaurant, and even though it's tiny, it's a life savor in such a busy area, especially on weekends"
/user_details?userid=Bc0Mv-QnUPKiq8xFLCbw4g,Blair M.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"I am in love with this restaurant, if only they hired better staff to handle the front of the house it would become a regular spot for me. The service is so slow but the restaurant is amazing. From my experience so far you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order from their menu. Great atmosphere and great food, hopefully the service speeds up and then its a perfect night out."
/user_details?userid=u11tj3w2mgCdsNILFQsqcQ,Sanjeev M.,"Naperville, IL",4 star rating,"great Kafta.... tried both w/ Aubergine and w/ Pomegranate, wonderful Syrian food;... only thing a bit concerting was the neighborhood around the restaurant which was a bit run down w/ graffiti all around.  that did not interfere with our enjoyment.  Very helpful people."
/user_details?userid=jyQ7Wtx936CaklmHNo9dfg,Rahul S.,"Cupertino, CA",5 star rating,"We stumbled upon this place on our first night in Montreal. This was the only place we could find that was open at 11pm in this area. Everything was excellent, from their lamb with garlic to their baba ghanouj to their special hummus-like side made from beet root. The owners were very nice. They were celebrating a friend's birthday that night and gave us slices of the birthday cake. They say when they opened the place, the focus was on the experience (they had great eclectic music on when we were there) and food was second but we disagree - food was really excellent. Finally, some things were missing from the menu. For example, they said they don't have falafel because they feel its gotten too commercial. So I wouldn't expect typical mid-eastern fare but whatever we tried was excellent."
/user_details?userid=wpP-IOjq6LVOfFWwOE9gSA,Joelle N.,"Outremont, Canada",2 star rating,Brunch was decent but not exciting. Shame about the pitiful service and the 35-minute wait especially when the place was less than full.
/user_details?userid=vfp94ODaRGW2F848Rark_A,Sammy Y.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Has to the be one of the best Middle Eastern food in Canada I have ever tried. In a fresh concept restaurant design, the arabic dishes were extremely good and well worth it. We had asked to keep the dishes coming one after another as soon as we were done one, which was done! Variety of food was fairly good, as those meals are not easy ones to cook. Waitress was exceptional as was the rest of the beautiful young ladies staff! If you are in Montreal and know your food, I have to recommend that you go to this place. I was there on Feb 14th, 2014 on a cold winter night!"
/user_details?userid=BoRp3z_2wGlxFL8nGP0QIg,Luc P.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Very good. Tastiest fattouch in a long while. Super Nice service. Lamb was great. Ground veal was a bit on the overcooked side. Very cold basement for washrooms.
/user_details?userid=F0tYHaVuk58XIxbv8ZfrjA,steel m.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Really, really yummy.  The fattouch salad was one of the best I've ever had.  Muhammara was a little chunkier than I prefer it, but still quite flavorful.  All in all, a really delicious meal and a great place."
/user_details?userid=LP8V36wrw89TKUb5CwdmaA,Mahesh S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I see a lot of good comments here, so I'll put our experience as a one off, but it truly was horrible - probably the only time in the 7 years I've been in Montreal that I've wanted to walk out of a restaurant. The service was terrible, slow, inconsiderate and whatever other uncomplimentary adjective you can think of. It was pretty humiliating in parts with the person who looked the owner fawning over a bigger table, while our waiter seemed the most disinterested creature on the fact of the earth. It took over half hour for one of the dishes we ordered to get to us - and no apologies, no updates, we were left waiting in one corner of the room. The food was painfully average - one of the dishes was fine (the moutaqa i think) but apart from that the baba ganouj was pretty average, and the kibbe were too salty. So all in all, I felt like I wasted a good deal of my money, and couldn't even leave with the satisfaction that I was treated well by the staff. Horrible, won't be going back again!"
/user_details?userid=8sLSLlDPqPeWCPGwwW0tzA,wed g.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic restaurant for syrian food. It is like a hipper, younger, light-spirited version of Aleppe. Highly recommend the potatoes, the hummus, and the chicken breast. Fattoush is good too. Youll need reservations on weekends not because theyre overwhelmingly busy, but because they arent very effective at distributing tables. Nonetheless, worth it!"
