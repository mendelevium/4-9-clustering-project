I always knew this place was good but never had the opportunity to try. We ordered the guacamole as an entree and it was amazing, very creamy and mild. Then we had the chicken wings which had just enough kick and tangy-ness. For the tacos we went for the baja fish tacos and the pollos hermanos chicken tacos and they were excellent. We finished it off with churros, hmmmmm.Our server was super friendly too and explained some of the menu to us and made recommendations. Honestly, great service, great food, super chill vibe."

I found this place via Yelp and gave it a try, here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right off of Rue Drummond in what I'd like to call one of the party districts... is this gem.  There's no private parking lot so good luck finding a spot on the street, they give hefty tickets out here.  I know because I got one.  We sat outside on the wooden patio that holds about 5 or 6 tables.  I didn't check out much of the inside, but when I did go to the bathroom I was in awe at the beautiful murals that were downstairs!  There was so much color and all of the walls were covered in them.  It was fascinating for sure.Service: I can't remember the young lady's name, but she was a rock star.  She was running in and out the restaurant (since the outdoor section was technically across the sidewalk away from the main building) and was just taking good care of us.Food: I tried 2 sets of tacos and 1 tostada!  I was not disappointed!  My favorites were the Korean Steak Tacos!  They're made up of sirloin steak, oaxaca cheese, grilled cactus, pickled jalapeno and an ""orange crush sauce"".  Doesn't that sound enticing?!  It was fabulous.  I had never had grilled freaking cactus before, but I will be sure to have it in the future!  The 2nd set I had were called the Mr. Mole which concocted of grilled chicken, mole sauce, feta cheese, red onions, sesame crackers and cilantro.  The mole sauce is what drew me to these because I know it's an authentic Mexican condiment made up of about 30 ingredients.  Cool right?! There were delicious.  Last, but not least were the La Tinga tostadas which are the same corn tortillas that are used in the taocs (not all tacos), but they're fried so they're completely flat.  It's like a hard taco... but not a taco.  Lol.  The La Tinga used a tomato & chipotle chicken base with queso fresno, pickled jalapeno, Mexican cream, chili and guajillo sauce.  It was a little messier than the tacos, but still absolutely fabulous.Value: All prices are in $CAD.  So the base price for any set of 2 tacos or tostadas is $8.95 then things go up from there.  My steak tacos were an additional $1.95.  Not bad AT ALL.  Now my tequila flight was $27.95.  That's where you start to run the bill up.  Lol.In conclusion I really enjoyed myself here and will certainly make more #TacoTuesday appearance here!  You should too!"

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This my first time at the second location of Escondite. I was hoping to try out their terasse but it was raining. Nonetheless I was happy to sit in the cooler basement area. The decor is so authentic. I ordered the steak (11)$, cauliflower (9$) tacos to share (they come in pairs). Of the two the steak was a 5/5 - the perfect amount of spice balanced out with a sweet crush sauce. I added the Chipotle Tabasco for a kick. It almost tasted like a beef bulgogi. The cauliflower taco was average. I thought the piece of cauliflower was too large to fit in a taco. We had the chicken tinga tostada (a pair for 9$) that was served on a crispy tortilla - this was a good dish but not as good as the steak. Top Top it off, the elote for 4$ was so good. The corn was large in size and good to share, lots of flavour. The drinks were pricey - 12$ a cocktail. I could've done without. For two people (2 tacos, 1 tostada, 1 elite, drink) was 38$ without tip and tax that is a solid deal.I noticed there was a tasting menu for 30$ as well per person but I only saw it at the end, which let's you sample many of the dishes. For someone that never liked Mexican food, this place converted me! This group never disappoints!"

/user_details?userid=i27n2r8kscamsvd0FSn4Fw,Christina A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Having been to the other location in the past, when my friend and I were searching for a ""light"" dinner, I suggested Escondite. Luckily there was a location close to our hotel so we headed out and crossed our fingers for seats at 6:15. When we first arrived, they said they didn't have seats but after checking their reservations, they offered to seat us at the bar but we'd have to be done by 7:15. My friend and I were starving and guaranteed them that we would be done within the hour.Everyone was super accommodating and service was great. The restaurant had a very casual environment and we enjoyed the vibe we got. We were served right away and we never waited long for anything. Maybe they were trying to rush as they needed the seats in an hour but I never felt rushed. Service was friendly and efficient and food was delicious.Our ""light"" dinner turned into a full on feast as we ordered guac and chips, shrimp ceviche, one cocktail each, churros and 3 types of tacos (the korean steak, pork belly and fish tacos). We enjoyed every bit and there were no remnants left of any of the dishes. We also appreciated the bartender's advice to eat the steak tacos last as they were a bit spicy and didn't want us to compromise the taste of the other 2 flavours. Following his advice, we were grateful as they had quite a kick and would have overpowered the delicious flavour of the other 2 tacos. In the end our favourite was the pork belly tacos.I'd recommend a visit here if you're into tacos as you'll get delicious food and really great service."
/user_details?userid=QBe3oadPKot2mtuh8jB1UQ,Gurvinder K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love Mexican food and had been wanting to try this place for a while. But you can't just walk in, they're always busy! So reservations are highly recommended! We started with guacamole and tortilla chips. Chips were strips of tortilla deep fried, interesting concept but a bit greasy. There are so many tacos to chose from, even a couple of vegetarian options. I tried the ancho tofu tacos, soooo good! Be aware that not all tacos are of the same size, some are smaller than others... so for 9-12$ for 2 tacos, that's not going to be enough for a meal. It adds up rather quickly. My husband and I got 3 plates of tacos, guacamole and a couple of drinks and the bill came to over $100! And we weren't even full yet!!"
/user_details?userid=S5ctdm7RTh2boNvlkZY4wg,Ssu Ying C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We had visited the restaurant before and ordered same tasting manu, the  previous experiences was amazing which makes us always want to come back. However this time we had group of 13 with reservation, the experiences  we have was totally not worth for a next visit. First of all, I have to say the food is good.We have 12 people order tasting manu, as per last experiences, we were not only enjoyed our food, but also we made our money valued for what we paid for. ( we were 3 people last time) Last time 3 of us had following dishes:1. Guacamole + nachos -1 bow to share2. Mango salad -1 bow to share3. Corn bread - 2 whole bread to share4. Ribs - total 6; 2 for each5. Quesadilla 3/4 portions (1/4 each)6. Tacos ( chicken and fish 1 for each) total 67. Fried chicken wings ( 3 pieces/ 1 for each)8. Churros  (1 for each)This time with such a big group, the quantity of food was reduced with no reason, we all had great tasting manu here before, we were thinking they might just add some new dishes on...but actually no.We had this time 1. Guacamole + nachos -4 bows to share with 12 people2. Mango salad -4 bows to share 12 people3. Corn bread - HALF of bread each4. Ribs - total 12; 1 for each5. Quesadilla - 2 fingers big size for each6. Tacos ( chicken and fish 1 for each) 7. Churros  (1 for each)We missed one dish...We love the food there, i only suggest it should set a standard quantity of food. We pay the same price, if there is any change we should get inform before ordering it. Not to surprising your old customers just by a sudden decreasing of the volume. We will feel very disappointed about it.Also, we had reservation, we didnt like it when they tried to squeeze 13 people into a 11 seats space without a better space utilization.It's sad to have such unpleasant dinning experiences during holiday seasons. We hope somehow the restaurant will consider to improve and provide a better customer experiences in the future."
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I've visited this restaurant twice and on both occasions, the food, service and ambiance were on point! Out of the three items that I've tried, the Baja Taco was my favourite. It's crispy cod, avocado crema, cabbage slaw, black pepper cream. This taco was packed with so many different flavours that all blended well together. My only complaint is that the portions are very small. If you're popping in for happy hour and small bites, this is perfect. If you're looking for a filling meal, this isn't your best bet. The restaurant is very small, but not crammed - more like super cozy. I'd advise making a reservation before-hand. On both visits, I popped in during the week and fortunately snagged the last available table. I enjoyed my visits and I'll be back!"

/user_details?userid=c-dchuYjRCwJVstIE5KnMQ,Mary V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We were a group of 8 who came for birthday lunches this past Tuesday. This location is slightly bigger and fits groups in a few sections. Always love looking around at the decor throughout the restaurant. There is something always eye catching. Our main server was attentive and kind.I ordered the mango salad which was very tasty and a good sized portion for one. I followed that by an order of the baja fish tacos which were satisfying. These dishes hit the spot and I did not feel overly full. The only reason for my 4 stars was that my colleague received 2x orders of his tacos as the server brought it to the wrong table. He was not compensated and paid for both. Despite the mix-up, my colleagues enjoyed their orders such as the general tao chicken, ribs, key lime dessert in a cup, and chicken tacos.I'll be back and the next time I'll order alcohol."

Great dishes to share, everything I had was great, great taste, nice presentation, and delicious, from the quesadillas to the tacos to their churros. I will definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,I've tried their union location before and really enjoyed it and this location was good too. The food and drinks are just as solid. The pork tacos and the steak tacos are my favourite and their churros are really good too ! We got great service and delicious food at a reasonable price. This location is still very fun with the decor and atmosphere but the win has to go to the union location for that. If you want to go at lunch make sure you have a reservation or you risk waiting minimum 20minutes but likely more because seating is limited especially for groups. This is a nice place for a date or a one on one outing but less for larger groups especially without a reservation. The food is really good though and service is always friendly !
/user_details?userid=88LmC2YAinpGL6Xr6bwsTg,Angela P.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW! What a find! I went to Escondite, the one on Drummond - NOT the one on Union Street! - to take a look at Stikki Peaches' artwork, which I have been following around the city. Much to my surprise, I found something I didn't except! My initial intentions were to have a quick coffee but the authenticity and hospitable ambiance of this little Mexican restaurant won me over and so I took a seat. As usual, I chose a table next to the window, but this time not so I can have a view to the outside, but rather to have a view of the whole place. I let the sweetest young waitress named Pascale bring me her recommendation according to my ""food mood"", which was something light (remember I had only intended to have a coffee). Was I in for another surprise... the food was out of this world! Or, at least, out of this country, as it traveled me to its place of origin... Mexico! Then I took a sip of my mojito, another super recommendation by Pascale. And BOOM, that's when it happened - it was love at first sip! I just had to know who created this killer mojito, and believe me, I've had my fair share of mojitos! It turns out it's Francesco, the barman who has his own little secret recipe (which I will never tell). Then along comes Pedro claiming that his mojito is better! So, how can I refuse to try it, right?  Now, the question is: Who makes the best mojito eveeeeer? I'll let you decide...The décor, the music, the ambiance, the staff, the food, the drinks - these are all what make this gem of a place my absolute favorite in Montreal! So much so that I even contemplated NOT sharing it with the world. Just so I can always find my spot, right there... next to the window!"

/user_details?userid=cpChkPvGOhp8lcyiLwj3eA,Hibeh D.,"Berlin, CT",5 star rating,"This is the newer location of the original Escondite on Av Union. They take reservations so I would recommend making one. The space is relatively small and really nicely decorated in a recurring Frida Kahlo theme. The menu has a wide variety of small plates. There were four of us and our server recommended we order approximately 10 small plates to share. We ordered 8 and that was perfect.I tried the Mojito del King cocktail-refreshing and tasty but I didn't find it to be spicy in spite of the jalapeño. Our small plate selection: shrimp ceviche, pork ribs, two orders of nachos (not with chips! More like little dumplings-yummy), mushroom quesadilla, steak, Baja & crispy chicken tacos. It was all very good.Although we were quite full, I still wanted to finish the meal off with an order of the churros. They were nice and hot, served with a side of Nutella.We will be back the next time we're in the area!"

I got the guacamole and some of the vegetarian tacos and was thoroughly impressed. The decor is dim and romantic. I recommend it for a date or gathering of 3 or fewer people. Definitely not suitable for groups. As a Texan, I feel a bit more comfortable knowing that I can find a pretty fair taco in this cold, cold city."

/user_details?userid=k3MTtInxWZc7Iu5QGC_QPg,Tanya G.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",1 star rating,"I have to say that my experience with Escondite's staff was far from ideal. I was charged twice for my meal and had a great deal of difficulty reaching the restaurant by phone. After a week of calling I finally got through, gave my information and was never contacted by the manager despite my following up. Given the degree of the error and the nature of the business (I.e. customer service) I would expect far more professionalism. Ultimately, I feel that people should know that the management staff have not conducted themselves in a just and professional manner and I could not be more disappointed with their customer service and inaction."
/user_details?userid=6l2q1yzi_lvUSVgXLCpLmg,Albina L.,"Brossard, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was good but overpriced. There were lots of people and the atmosphere was great. The decor and design were nice.Now.. the service... hard to explain, but the waiter's attitude was kind of aggressive and unwelcoming. He just stood there to interrupt our conversation to take order, kept emphasizing that the portions are very small and each person SHOULD order atleast 3 dishes so if you re a party of 4, ATLEAST 10 dishes... It's like we know what are tapas, and we can always order more if not enough. When it was time to pay, he just tells us no change allowed, decide right away if you want to pay separate or together and it was just weird how he didnt leave the credit card in the machine. He inserted it, inputs his amount but removed it, give you back the machine and credit card for you to input the tips and expects you to fast pass the creditcard yourself again and had this annoyed face all along. Overall, my evening went great but the service was far from impressive."
