/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is an amazing bar for manu reasons but if you want to keep anything from this  review, please retain the following information: perfect place for arainy day outing or when you're feeing the winter blues and wants to pretend you are in a terrasse.I absolutey love Bar Suzanne. The decor and ambiance makes you  feel relaxed by itself, and with all the cute planta hnging with the ceiling plus the transparent rooftop it makesyou feel like you are outside without being outside. That's why I love going there when it's raining - usually you would be in a crowded dark plce but Suzanne keeps the windows opened while keeping you safe and sound under the natural light and plants.The menu is also amazing! I love love love their fries (which I eat with chopsticks because why not!) and the beef onion curry dumplings! :)) I don't think you'll be disappointed with any of the drinks oe food so feel free to expore their menu!"

Tried some of the food, including the dumplings. Yum! Will def be back!Fyi, this is officially the first bar I have ever been to in Montreal. I was born and lived there 11 years and have been back since, however, I usually don't go out in Montreal since I'm usually just staying with the fam. So to say that this was my first real adult experience in Montreal.... Bar Suzanne.... It was my pleasure"
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My rating may be biased. I visited this spot when it was one of those hot and super humid days in Montreal summer. Before going to this bar I had been intrigued by it. I love a bar with plenty of plants. I want to feel like I am in a jungle sometimes. This place delivered. However, maybe it was the humidity and the plants all around the inside of this bar felt more like a greenhouse. I was sweating. It kinda ruined my experience since tight clothes, greenhouse humidity and sweatiness does not make someone feel cute. In addition, the noise level of this place was off the charts. It was hard to hold a conversation.I did fully appreciate the serving staff once they came around. It took them a long long time though. But once we asked for a wine in our usual palette they chose excellently. Still I don't feel compelled to show this place off to anyone."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,A really lovely and quiet bar in the plateau neighborhood. It is on the second floor so you get an amazing view of the cobblestone street below. Went on a Sunday evening and it was a great experience. Had the oysters and they were larger then most that I've had at bars. It's definately a great place eot catch up with friends.
/user_details?userid=TPfCVh0OoXuckE3_k96Btg,Rahim K.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a wonderfully chilled out space! Plants hanging from the ceiling, wonderful and friendly service, not super loud. An amazing place to spend a Sunday evening with a drink or more. If you get the table by the Juliette balcony like we did, you're in for a treat."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Cool bar on the block. I have a friend who lives just around the corner so we hopped for a drink.The place has a super cool vibe, the hanging plants the music it all works great. The staff were super friendly and easy on the free shots as well :)Beer selection is ok not amazing, but this is more of a romantic, date kinda of a pub. They have a cool twist on the fries with fish sauce and Japanese mayo. Overall I felt happy discovering a cool new spot they I am pretty sure I will re-visit"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We were strolling at Duluth and came across this bar. Decided to go inside as it looked very happening and full from the outside. We waited for 20 mins and ended up getting seats at the bar. The service is efficient and friendly!! My favourite part of the bar is that the space just opens up. There are lots of plants around and the lighting is perfect. It gives the bar the right kind of cosy feel making it the perfect spot for a romantic night out or even a night out with friends. Definitely glad we chose to come here. Will definitely we coming by again very soon!
/user_details?userid=lVgG1EF_67QKm9iilnwiRw,Aria I.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good drinks and amazingly cozy interior, live dj, but I found the music a bit too loud to speak comfortably."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers on this place- bar Suzanne really shines because of the space. I appreciate, above the beautiful decor and the fantastic music, that it's a sizeable bar that gives a lot of room to each patron. There's zero sense of being on top of one another here, which is fantastic. In that vein, it makes a really nice date spot (I think 75% of the people we saw last night were on some sort of date). Additionally, the service was really attentive and things are pretty reasonably priced for what you get.Where they drop the ball, as others have commented, is on the food. I'll have to give other plates a try in the future, but the dumplings were a lunch bag let down. We ordered the two veggie dumplings and both tasted like over-seasoned baby food in a dumpling wrapper. I'm not sure why they insist on puréeing the contents of the dumplings beyond recognition but it doesn't do justice to their ingredients.The drinks were ok- I ordered a gin cocktail with grapefruit/rosemary syrup. I'm a citrus fiend but the syrup really overpowered the rest of the flavours and I wasn't able to distinguish the roméo gin (a gin tasty enough on its own) from everything else. The beers, however, were reasonably priced and I appreciate that they have a decent variety."
/user_details?userid=azZdNaUfeb8J9H1k_aoWJQ,Agnes W.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This bar is really hip and fun. My friends and I came earlier in the night around 9 and didn't have to wait for a table. They have a live DJ playing and the music was fantastic. The waitress recommended some cocktails for my friend and I and we both really enjoyed it. The only downside of the place is that it doesn't have AC. It was realllllyyyy hot in Montreal that day and sitting there with cool drinks didn't really help. Even though there were fans, we were still really hot. Overall, it's a really cool place to check out and go with friends!"
/user_details?userid=JmrZp13UyBro1SiS30Q45Q,Karina L.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"This bar is wonderful! The service was friendly and approachable and the space is beautiful. Way bigger than it seems. This would be a great place if you're looking for a quick bite in a well-lit but cozy space. THE SPACE + SERVICE:Covered in plants -- so pretty! This place has a greenhouse feel. One side has the bar and some communal high tables. The other side of the bar has bigger sit down tables for bigger groups and the opening to the kitchen. It was nice these two spaces were distinct, as we sat on the quieter bar side while a big group was on the bigger side. THE MENU:Tasty and fun. We enjoyed every cocktail we got (). Some of them were a little sweet, though. We were too full for food, but the interesting dumpling variations caught our eye. Would come back here in a second for the space and the interesting menu."
/user_details?userid=IlvHu0uu8OuHeB8tsKfg3g,Avita T.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I love this place. It has a gorgeous ambiance and great vibe - its really hip and fun. Came here with some friends and we loved the drinks. They were unique and so well complemented with the live DJ, great service and fun vibes. We also ordered the fries which were nice. I look forward to coming back for the ambiance. Its a great bar."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"I liked it! The bar is beautiful and in such a great spot, I loved the big open ceiling and huge windows and plants everywhere. I loved the quote on the way up the stairs that got the Leonard Cohen song Suzanne in my head on my way in. All of the staff were kind and helpful and present, and I loved the vegan Whisky Sour and the glass of sparkling wine I had. The food, I gotta by real, was only ok. We started with oysters which were fresh, and not outrageously priced which I appreciate, but they weren't cut out of their shells which made them pretty hard to eat. We got six with a regular mignonette, and 6 with a house special with a kind of watermelon foam that for me just didn't work. Too sweet, just weird with oysters. We also ordered some dumplings, I had the one veggie option on the menu, basically pureed eggplant which I loved the taste of but the dumpling skins were too thick and heavy. I will definitely go back because I really liked the vibe. There's other little bites on the menu I'd try but mostly I'd go for drinks with friends."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice cute little place, original somewhat concept. I especially like their ceiling, if you there be sure to check it out. Their drinks are original and delish, I haven't eaten there yet, but the dining area does look pretty cool. Service? Very good, friendly and quick, just like I like it. Atmosphere? Nice and romantic and cool at the same time, whether it's a night out with friends or a date. Overall? Yep, I'll be back for more."
/user_details?userid=LJmdyaOmmpJSXUCvppTH7Q,Philippe L.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Canada",5 star rating,"Don't know if I'd call this a speakeasy.  It's in a charming location in Montreal.  The bar has a bunch of Leonard Cohen references, starting with the name!  There's a fun cocktail card, the staff is nice and attentive and the place is very nice.  Would go back!"
/user_details?userid=RGCz5-IVUpdaNWRxOJhUww,Matt S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The little table near the open balcony window was too sunny and welcoming for me to not poke my head in and check this place out. They've redone the space to be airy, welcoming and full of plants- I came on a sunny afternoon and it was a beautiful spot for a quick drink. Great service -  the cocktail and dumplings I tried were yum. I definitely want to come back check it out at night!"
/user_details?userid=QBMwGhPQ2PGm6Ur-98i5gg,Jillian C.,"Portsmouth, NH",2 star rating,"Went for a drink, took a while to get a server, crowded, loud, felt like more of a club environment than how I imagine a speakeasy. Martinis were just ok."
/user_details?userid=C03V7MNbZJcyicgHvyE5fw,Benedicte F.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Simple, végétal, luminous and pretty bar/ resto. You can feel a great team of people achieved this Resto-bar concept.The small menu only contains original side food ideas perfect for sharing with whomever. Their wonderful bay windows make it the perfect place for a first date.That's right! Sitting at the tables next to them gives you the opportunity to do a lot of people watching. People watching is always a good conversation starter. Located corner of St-Laurent and Duluth, lots of cool weirdos pass by and it is just a great location in general.The music totally hit the spot with me; 80's New Wavish music. Perfect volume.Impeccable service and attitude.Thank you Suzanne!!"
/user_details?userid=J4atLeJAnJ1KScSex4XFdA,Jacob L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",5 star rating,Amazing atmosphere. The roof is too cool with Ivys growing down from the ceiling boxes. Unique cocktails and the menu is creative. Definitely will be back!
/user_details?userid=tf82l2F8G0qC0fnEFR9tdw,T S.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"This place has a gorgeous space, and a cool vibe. It's a really great place to chill on a nice night and sit by the big open windows. We went on a slow night so the service was really good too, and the wine list has a nice range and some interesting picks."
/user_details?userid=HyVvSkT3E9ieFF1zYN7ykQ,Heather S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place blew me away - completely unexpectedly. The music upon entering was on point - so perfect for the venue. The service was friendly and very helpful we loved our waiters!!! The food was delicious - mind blown by the lobster beef dumplings and the fried chicken - oh, and make sure to order the fries they are a standout. Also the most comfortable chairs ever. We will be back for sure!!!!!!!"

/user_details?userid=myFBnMYoisC3YTknE9tXGA,Daniel N.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Went here last night with a group of friends and loved it. The food is fantastic - we ordered the beef curry and shrimp pork dumplings (with squid ink dough!), which were both delicious. The green beans were insanely good and those fries are the best I've had in a long time. Drinks weren't exceptional, but they were still tasty cocktails. I'll be back every time I come through Montreal."
/user_details?userid=vbYgV0nl0rKZxCVLxQEWag,Kirill Z.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is a pub in disguise. Fancy decor, fancy cocktails. Trying to be bougie, but it's not. Save yourself some money and get a beer if ever you're stuck in here. If you want a proper cocktail, go elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=lEz60kALvhe0Qu3uhFulgA,Aidan D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So happy I came here!  First of all, beautiful atmosphere. Perfect for a date night, or just getting together a group of friends for a fun night of drinking. Lots of beautiful plants and lighting to cheer you up over this dreary winter. They always have awesome  djs and the scene is really chill. Great wine selection and I  love the balsamic fries and dumplings. The staff is friendly and attentive too which is always a plus! Not superficial like other places. Overall amazing atmosphere! Will definitely keep coming back"
