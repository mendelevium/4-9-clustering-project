Last time was years a lot and I went for their summer ice treat. This time I ordered from delivery app. I had soup and rice bowl. The package was very good. The taste was just like other Korean restaurants. I do think the soft tofu soup should be better if had it at the place. I don't complain I like the soup very much. There was plenty of beef and an egg in the soup. If you like Korean food, try this place and you won't be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Opiano is another restaurant that I've had on my bookmarks for a while. They are closed on weekends, and not living in Montreal, I'm usually just in town for the weekend, so the timing hasn't worked out for me. However, I recently had a weekend getaway to Montreal with my mom and we arrived early Friday morning, so we were able to eat at Opiano that evening!We had dinner there and it was fantastic! Portions were huge and the food was tasty. So Opiano is inside the Cartier building. The same building as Super Sandwich, or as it was known when I was living in Montreal and a regular customer, Depanneur Super Sandwich. Opiano is a very casual eatery. It's actually located in the atrium of the building and only partially cordoned off (I could see the entrance to Super Sandwich from when I was sitting). You order and pay at the counter and they write a number on your receipt. Then you sit wherever you want. When your order is ready, they call out your number and you go and retrieve your food. When you are done, you bring your tray back to the counter where you got your food. It's not a glamourous place, but the food was excellent and definitely a good value for what you pay. I got the beef bulgogi bibimbap ($10) and my mom got the beef bulgogi Dosirak (which is like a Bento box) ($13.25). Hers was a better value, as it was a lot of food.I really enjoyed my beef bulgogi bibimbap. It had beef bulgogi, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, broccoli, radishes, sliced omelette, and nori (seaweed). I was also given a bottle of hot sauce. I used some of it and it was pretty good. The bibimbap was served in a regular bowl and they didn't have the option of a hot stone bowl (dolsot), which I prefer, as your meal remains really hot throughout. Even without the dolsot though, I still really liked my dish. The meat was lean and flavourful, and not too salty. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and the combination was delicious. The hot sauce had a nice kick to it too. My meal came with a miso soup, which was ok, but only lukewarm. It would have been better if it was actually hot. My mom's Dosirak had beef bulgogi, rice, salad, 6 pieces of vegetable kimbap (like sushi), 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, and miso soup. She loved her meal. I had some of the kimbap and it was fresh and tasty. The tempura was crispy and I liked that the batter was not too thick. We requested no sesame seeds on our food and that wasn't a problem at all. I was stuffed to the gills after dinner, but I really wanted to try the Bingsoo, so my mom and I shared a small mango Bingsoo ($5.50). I thought that it would be tiny, but it was quite sizeable. I loved the shaved ice/snow. It was creamy and not too sweet. The mango were not quite ripe, so they were still a bit firm and sour. I didn't mind this, but my mom likes her mango much sweeter and more ripe. The sliced almonds gave the Bingsoo a bit of a textured crunch. I loved it so much. Staff were nice and pleasant. We bought bottled water ($1 each for Kirkland brand from Costco, lol) but then we realized that they had a water dispenser of tap water. Delicious inexpensive food with friendly staff, what's not to like? If you don't mind the lack of table service and very casual atmosphere and you like Korean food, you need to try Opiano!Street parking only."

Although it looks like it has a lot of spice, the spice didn't soak into the meat. The broth is good though.The pork bone also isn't as soft as the ones I had in other places.Their Bibimbap is good, nothing special. But their servings is small for their price. Overall, their service is fast and have decent food for students. Although during the semester, at lunch the place will be packed and has a long lineup!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Not sure why this place is so popular...It's overpriced. The quality of the food is sub par. There are long wait times at lunch for both take out and sit in. Yes - still - I come here once or twice a semester because if proximity to my office. I regret it somewhat every time.They seem to have interesting desert options and these seem popular among the sit in crowd. I haven't tried this but it does look good. Maybe that can reconcile my perspective to the one of the ""market"" (which clearly likes this place - as indicated by the long lines)."
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Got the bulgogi bento box. Honestly for the price it was kinda steep. It was $17 after tax and that is pretty pricy for korean places that I've been to. The bento gives a variety to eat but I found the meat to be too oily for my taste. It was good to try but for the price not sure if I'd come back since there's other korean places I much rather prefer going to
/user_details?userid=X9CQJrMskkXV_4or3FSmeQ,Ivana K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my top fave korean restos in Montreal .They are open from 10am to 8, so i would go for breakfast before work sometimes.I rate this 5 star because;1) Food, is excellent, delicious and affordable. My All time fave is the Pork Bone soup, SoonDuBu and HweDuBap. Also very good Dessert; Bingsoo (Shaved Ice)2) The Service is Good and fast. You Order at the counter and find a seat, they call your number when your order is ready and you pick it up, Fast, easy, simple!3) Nice Decor, cutely decorated cafeteria, its a great spot too, in downtown! I recommend this place"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Since I discovered Opiano earlier this month, I've been there at least 6 times. Sadly, today is their last day before their 3 weeks-long summer vacation. I tried their bulgogi and spicy chicken Dosirak (combo box). Each box includes a bowl of miso soup, a salad, a good portion of rice, two pieces of vegetable tempura, 5 pieces of sushi and the main dish of choice. That's a lot of food!! Portions are always generous, and the bulgogi is one of the best I've had in town. We also tried one of their sushi dishes. It came as 6 rather large pieces - it was good, but not as satisfying as the dosirak. But it's great to share with friends if you want to try different dishes!Now on to the bingsoo. I'm seriously addicted to it. No kidding, I think about it everyday and wouldn't mind eating it every morning and every night. We even came up with a chant for it! ""Shaved ice! It's so nice! Shaved ice! Every night!""We tried pretty much all flavors at this point: matcha, mango, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, red beans, rice cake. The matcha is still my ultimate favorite, but the mango is close behind. If you never had Opiano's shaved ice, today's your chance!!I'm going there tonight for dinner, but I don't know what I will do for the next 3 weeks. I guess I'll go hide in a corner and *cry*"
/user_details?userid=5CbfKqyOSe63xH6CJL9sSA,Maxine R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"SUCH an affordable and delicious place! my group of three and i came here at around noon and were pleasantly surprised. it's located inside of a shopping plaza so at first we didn't know what to expect. when we got inside though, we saw that the atmosphere was neat and clean. the servers and cooks were all very kind and helpful, giving us suggestions on what to order. although this place is self order, the customer service here was astoundingly good! We ordered the chicken cutlets- served with white rice and a salad, veggie tempura udon, pan fried veggie dumplings, bulgogi set- served with vegetable sushi, veggie tempura, white rice, salad, and a beef mix, and a ramen style noodle soup with spam and sausage (i've forgotten what it's called)- served also with white rice. For dessert we got the mango shaved ice which was made partly out of ice partly out of milk and was very good. All were delicious but the udon really stuck out to us as being REALLY GOOD. the kind of udon that makes you say ooooh-damn! i would strongly recommend getting the udon, veggie pan fried dumplings (delicious!), and the crispy chicken cutlet meal (so good!). Although, I did not like how for all veggie tempura dishes (udon and bulgogi set) all the veggies were sweet potato. in my opinion, both dishes would be better with a variation of vegetables. Also the water cups, which you go up to fill yourself, are very small and would need multiple trips to the fountain to get enough water. But everything makes up for both of these things."
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Simply love this place! Been there few times and it never disappointed me. We ordered the dosirak spicy pork and a plate of rice cakes. The meat is well seasonned.  I've also tried their shaved ice for the first time and it is different from the Tawainese shaved ice. They are both delicious in their own way! Really refreshing. Comforting food.They are located near metro Peel. It takes a few minutes walk to get over there. Really convenient. Always lots of people since is in downtown and it is near 2 universities.If you haven't been there already, give it a try:)"

Would DEFINITELY go back!"
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I go to this place at least 2-3 times per week. I would say this is the best place to have a decent meal around McGill. Everything from the price to the quality to the atmosphere is perfect. There is no tip since there are so servers, but everything else is more like a restaurant than a fast food place. The dishes come in nice bowls and plates on a tray. My favourites are the Dosirak (lunch box) and the pork bone soup. If I'm not too hungry, I'll go with the kimbap, the midi special or a salad (their salad sauce is the best I've ever had). For the Dosirak and hoedeopbap, you get a 10% coupon every time you buy one, and you can accumulate 10 of them and get one free if you go often enough (I've already gotten 3 free ones...). They used to also include a chocolate in the napkin which was nice but they don't anymore. I've asked and they said it was because a lot of people don't eat it and they go to waste. They told me I can still ask for them, which I do and they actually gave me a couple :) They are changing their menus now to include bingsoo, can't wait to see what that's like!"

What a sweet little surprise hidden in the basement of this commercial building next to McGill on Sherbrooke. It's clean and bright with big comfy chairs and while the menu offers office building eats like coffee and danishes and club sandwiches, it's also got a Korean menu that's killer. I ordered the lunch box with spicy pork, it comes with salad, a couple sushi, a couple tempura vegetables, miso soup, all with fresh ingredients and delicately flavoured all for like $11! The amazing Arun brought me here since she's working nearby, she has become a regular at Opiano because of the happy-making vegetarian options, including some really nice plump dumplings. Friendly helpful service, super quick - if you're doing a 1hr business lunch you will be fine. Highly recommended in general. Thanks to local yelpers for helping me find magic like this!!"

If you are not big fan of a soup meal, they also have this combo called Dosirak which comes with choice of meat (bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken) accompanied with rice,salad, sushi rolls, tempura at a very decent price. They also have this shaved ice dessert so finely shaved that it tastes creamy. Strongly recommended."

This place has restored my faith lol! I tried the lunch special. It came with a miso soup and a side of seaweed salad. It was fresh. It was tasty and it was BIG!!! I can easily find myself sharing this one order with another person. I got there five minutes after lunch hours so technically I wouldn't even be able to get the lunch special but they were kind enough to make it for me! Thanks guys! Super nice and friendly service!!!
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located in the basement of a shopping complex across the street of of McGill, Opiano is tucked away in the corner, hidden just enough that I would have had a hard time stumbling upon it had we not originally set out to eat there. We went on a Thursday night at 6:00; it was moderately busy but not too crowded. I ordered a bibimbap, which was honestly pretty average. My friend got the tteokbokki with extra noodles - spicy but pretty good. Other friend ordered the bento box, which had huge portions. However, the bingsoo seriously redeemed their rating. The shaved ice was honestly amazing! I've eaten at painnamou many times, so I was glad to hear that they had moved to opiano instead of closing. If it were just the bingsoo, I'd give it a 5/5!"

I must admit they did have a nice twist with the sea weed but a bit pricey and overall it wasn't that good and I dont think I will come here again."
/user_details?userid=-ZEb0DgVva5CkS0FfAKmsg,Grace L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Being a Korean native, I can't help being skeptical of Asian food, oh yes, especially of Korean food. But Opiano has been my favorite Korean restaurant by far.This is a good place for a reasonably priced, casual Korean (or Asian meals such as sushi) meal. Even though the low price (usually $9-13 per meal, non-obligation for the tip as well!) is the great reason to visit this place, I personally think the low price was highlighted so well so the food taste and good quality of ingredients were not featured enough. Taste is as great and authentic as ones you could eat in Korea. I also liked the food were not overwhelmingly spicy, as many current Korean restaurants currently were. If you are searching for a fancy, more sophisticated Asian cuisine, this place is not the perfect one. It will be packed with people, almost you'd feel like a food court. This place is for an easy and casual meal.Generally, bento (Dosirak, or box) menu are all good that you can try little of many things. When ordering bento menu, you can ask a discount coupon for the box menu for your next visit. The dessert menu- Bingsu (shaved ice with all kinds of sweets) is worth to try, and the portion is large. even small would feed two enough if you are eating as a dessert after a meal."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,SO GOOD! Great value too - a lot for $14. The bulgogi is good and not too salty or saucey.

Whenever you buy a dosirak, the nice korean girl gives you a coupon for the next 10% off for another dosirak  i love their chicken katsu and sushi.

The highlight was the bingsoo which is shave ice .it was really good , not too sweet, very tasty. But the bento bulgogi and the spicy chicken were not as good as the bingsoo, it had just the plain taste to it, not bad but not good, kind of boring taste, and the meat was not soft neither, I will be back to try some other things and hopefully it will be better than this time!"
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ramyun was absolute rip off (~10$ after taxes). It was literally a pack of instant noodles (powdered mix seasoning) with the addition of a couple stripes of chicken, brocoli (??) and spring onions -- probably worth 2.30$ (after taxes hehe) honestly. I've been there twice, I also had the pork bone soup. The pork bone was immense, but the meat has been mostly shredded so there wasn't much to eat. The soup was spicy but lacked in depth of flavour. At this point, I think it's clear that they only cook with powered mix and pastes instead of real ingredients... As for their best-seller, the dosirak, the bugolgi beef was dry and flavourless. If it weren't the closest 'asian' restaurant around McGill, I wouldn't know why people bother going there. Might be korean/asian fever xD"

Everything I'd expect from a korean resto. Got the bulgogi dosirak, with my only complaint being the rice was one large glob. Probably added too much water in the cooker, so I won't hold it against them. The tempura sauce also tasted like nothing, so yeah, too much water added. I expected a sweet flavour. Anyhow, great portions, great food and a comfortable place to have a quick lunch. Found this place through yelp (thanks guys!) cause I pass by this place after work and never noticed it! Will be back to try other items.Also, they play classical music, wrap a chocolate with your chopsticks and give you a 10% off coupon. Very cute."

Unfortunately, they keep bumping up the prices on the sandwiches, so it might no longer be a good deal.No wifi :("

My personal favourite is their Vegetable Ramen and you can ask them to top it with vegetable tempura which is just amazing. Their ramen is the Korean style spicy ramen and really just good stuff. They also play the nicest music - good classical music that's soothing and makes it a great place to have lunch with company because you can actually talk!Would strongly recommend Opiano - it's a great lunch spot and you can come here and have something completely different every day of the week!"

Having been here for more than 10 times, I assume a lunch for one person should cost around 9-13$ on average.Overall, this restaurant deserves a five star as a semi-fast-food restaurant/cafe, considering its food quality, serving speed and convenient location.

The cashier was really nice and friendly, he showed us the difference in sizes super quickly between small and regular bingsoos. Must I say, their red bean bingsoo was PHENOMENAL, I'm definitely going back for more! My mother and sister also ordered some food - a sundubu jjigae and some tteok bokki. They were both quite good, but I'd say the tteok bokki was quite average. I'd still say the bingsoo was the highlight of the experience in Opiano though. It's worth a visit just for that.

They have a wide selection to choose from and even if you are not big on asian food (which I can't possibly imagine, but hey, everybody's different) you could find something that would suit your taste. The seatings are comfortable and it is a great place to hang out with friends as the noise level is never too high even at the busiest hours and you can actually hear and be heard! It is a very intimate and relaxing spot! However, las time I checked they didn't have wifi (or you'd have to ask them for a password, not sure about that), so it's probably a better spot to read or focus on some work that doesn't involve the world wide web.

It's super close to the downtown mcgill campus so it's very convenient to grab some decent Korean food. It was fast, reasonably priced and filled my craving for food from home."
/user_details?userid=xtM2Q8Djh5A4p04YvX8Zaw,Réjean T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Friendly staff, fast service. I tried two dishes. The beef bibimbap was OK, the pork ramen was disappointing: the broth seemed to have been made with industrial powder - or at least I found some at the bottom of my bowl when I was done eating. Apart from that OK prices, and nice location."

/user_details?userid=T5BOAvuPsNAhjYTFkRqZ1Q,Jennifer S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We ordered the the Sundubu jjigae and the pork bone soup. The pork bone soup is probably the best I've tasted around Montreal. The portions are huge and the broth is rich and savory. I would rate the soup 6/5 if I could! However, the sundubu jjigae fell short in flavour. The soup was watery, overly sweet, and not spicy at all. For $11.99, you can get a much better sundubu jjigae elsewhere."

You order at the counter then they'll call out the number of your order. I tried the mochi and chocolate bingsoo, the pork bone soup and the pork katsu bento. The quality is good. I only wish they serve some banchans with the meal."
/user_details?userid=t-roFPNc_ZRkIljwRVJZZQ,Anastasiya R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It is Yelp that has lead me to this Korean café, as I would never have noticed it otherwise: it is located in the basement of a building called Le Cartier, at the corner of Sherbrooke and Peel. While the idea of a café in a basement may not sound that appealing, it is completely worth hiding from the sun for a little while. The place looks nice and simple, and there is plenty of seating space. Although the menu has a wide range of options that include sandwiches, sushi and Korean specialties, I have stuck with the dosirak so far. This delicious ""lunch box"" option averages $12 plus tax, and has everything I could possibly want in one: miso soup, rice, salad, a few sushi and tempura, along with a choice of meat. (The little piece of chococolate that they include with the meal is a nice touch as well.) The ordering process itself is quick and easy: order and pay at the front, take a seat while you wait for your number to be called, pick up your food, stare in disbelief at how big your portion is, and enjoy."

/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for dinner and was I surprised?! The concept was a mix of food court style and a sit down restaurant. You serve yourself. You order first and then sit down. When they call your name, you pick up your food and eat. I had their bulgogi and it was so good! I like my bulgogi with a sweeter Korean BBQ sauce and Opiano really showed me what good bulgogi was. The plate that I got included the bulgogi with rice on the side and a small bowl of miso soup. It was $9/$10 which was not at all expensive because they gave you a lot of food. For dessert I split a red bean bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) with my friend. It was really good. I actually like it a lot better than Painnamou (a Korean shaved ice place that close at the beginning of Summer 2016). The bingsoo ice was quite flavourful and the red bean was not overly sweetened. I will definitely come here again!!! They also offer a lot of other things on their menu like pork bone soup, kim bap, etc!!"

/user_details?userid=iPemyqGqb2bTzZpmLKwv3Q,Kaixin Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is so boss and all the ppl there are super friendly. Its a little bit hidden but if you're a McGill student you should def know about this place. I go here frequently and honestly ALL their menu items are pretty good. My favorites are definitely their box meals (usually bulgolgi or chicken katsu), their pork bone soup and kimbaps. They also have a breakfast special if you go before 11! Prices are very reasonable as well, def recommend. Especially for students (super close to bronfman) looking for a quick yet GOOD meal in between classes."

/user_details?userid=JNpQCn77Mdx8cvSTCdOHfQ,Q B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,This places closes at 8 pm not 7 pm as indicated in Yelp.A good option if you are looking for something quick and reasonably priced. Food was clean and delicious. Nice for take out or sit down in a food court type of setting.

The Korean food they serve is cheap, legit and tastes just like homemade. I recommend bibimbap and hoedoepbap especially."
/user_details?userid=SkdhjlnbPnPJooGLBB3HXA,Mary I.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"It's convenient, fast, the ambiance of a student coffee shop. The crowd is young. The staff is efficient and polite. However, the food is pretty awful. It's McDonald's of Korean and Japanese. Weathered salmon and rotten ginger were not cool. Nor recommended."
/user_details?userid=ihy3YEL2ugtXOKFKDoX3tA,Linda Z.,"Anaheim, CA",5 star rating,One of the best places to go for lunch around McGill. Also one of the best Korean restaurants in downtown. Love their pork bone soup and spicy pork. The staff are super nice. It's also very convenient for take out.
