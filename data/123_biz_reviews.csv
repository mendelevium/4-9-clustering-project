/user_details?userid=v3EM08-SxUq0HNF2Aj7n8g,Natalia M.,"Edgewater, NJ",5 star rating,I will miss this place dearly! This restaurant is truly a gem. The tapas are outstanding and the sangria is scrumptious. If you get anything here do yourself a favor and get the croquetas de bacalao they are probably the best ones I've ever had and you won't regret it. I wish I could've gone one last time before moving but the border is closed.
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute restaurant with pretty good food. The cod cakes were so good and the sauce that came with it was delicious and perfectly balanced. The jamon were also pretty decent, as well as the paella. We also tried the fries which we found a bit too salty. The service is quick and the staff are nice. The inside is nicely decorated and has an exotic feel."
/user_details?userid=jDeGeFlTTY6C_m9fYVFMdg,Marilyn R.,"Fanwood, NJ",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I originally had dinner plans for a different restaurant further down from here but because their kitchen was closed we decided to give this place a try and I'm SO glad we did!This place really came in clutch because we were starving LOL. What we ordered: We started off with the Patatas Bravas which were really warm, yummy and perfectly paired with their sauce. We then ordered the Chicken Croquette (not pictured) which I have to say was my least favorite dish because I wasn't a huge fan of the taste for some reason. Then we got the Garlic Shrimp which was EPIC... As a huge lover of seafood this dish hit the spot because of the delicious garlic sauce and how great the entire dish was. Even dipping your bread in that sauce felt like heaven for us! For our last dish I can't quite remember the name of it but it included Mussels, fish, and an incredible sauce or soup base! My top dishes had to be the Patatas Bravas, Garlic Shrimp and the last seafood dish. I would most certainly come back, 5/5 rating!"
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm very lucky to have found this spot through Yelp. I had an amazing meal here a couple months ago and have neglected to write a review, so it is time to rectify my mistake! I started with a glass of Cava, which is a traditional sparkling Spanish wine.For the food, we got one of the mixed jámon boards (mix of 3 cold cut meats and 2 cheeses) which comes with tomato bread. We also got a trio of croquettes - ham, cod, and braised oxtail. I liked all of them but my favorite was actually the oxtail which was rich and deeply flavored. We then tried the fried eggplant with yogurt, honey and feta cheese, which was mind-blowing....easily my favorite dish. Lastly, we also shared the tapas sized octopus which was tender and slightly smokey. Since tapas are meant for sharing I had room for dessert so the choice was the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. I could have licked the plate and bowl clean because I have a serious love of chocolate, and these little bites of heaven were light and not greasy.This is a perfect spot for a date, a 5 à 7 with co-workers, a girls night out or any occasion really. They also have a nice little terrasse so get out there!"
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing Spanish restaurant!It's actually good for a drink and some tapas, cheese plate. But I went there for the paella .We ordered some starters and one seafood paella.  There all tasted good.  The service was very kind. Although it took some time to get the food, but it's totally fine :) The price is a little bit high giving the food portion is quiet small.  In addition the environment is very clean."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Ibericos was a super pleasant surprise both from ambiance and food point of view. The patatas bravas and grilled octopus were super delicious. There is a black board listing the specials of the day, which are not in the menu and are quite few to chose from. We selected the anchovies, prepared in two different ways, which were melting in my mouth. My friends definitely enjoyed their sea food paella, which was indeed generous on shrimp and mussels. Ibericos offers variety of drink options, but we decided to invest time and pleasant effort in consuming Estrella brew as it is symbolic for Barcelona. Our deserts were outstanding, you can pick safely both the chocolate churros or chocolate ganache. Two aspects to consider. Tall tables in shape of barrels are uncomfortable and the chairs have no back support. Next time I would look for a low table that is better sheltered from the opening of the door, it will be a motivating factor to stay longer and consume more. Don't leave your jacket at the back of the restaurant if you can, otherwise you may need to aerate it for at minimum 24 hours so the diverse cuisine smells will go away. I will back for sure as I overall enjoyed my time with good friends and nice food."
/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",4 star rating,"A fellow chef turned me onto Ibéricos over the summer. I had some time to kill while in Montreal for a short lunch prior to my meeting. So I went and was glad I did. As a solo I sat at my normal spot at the bar counter and began with a nice house rosé. When in Rome well you know... so I ordered the tasting platter that had several charcuterie which included: Ibérico, Chorizo, Salchichón and Lomo. I was impressed with the oiliness and pure joy those pieces gave me. I now understand the Hype.. This platter also included some garnishing of goat cheeses and dried pressed fruit along with some toasted tomato breads that sang and popped in my mouth! My second course included some avocado waffles with some hollandaise sauce and cured salmon which was intriguing but a dash too much of hot smoked paprika which overpowered the dish. This course also had a side dish of a potato leek soup with some crisps and a roasted cauliflower floret that was excellent. I wish I had more time and brought some fellow dinners with as I could of spent the afternoon eating some tapas and having a few glasses with friends.. but duty calls.. Loved the room with its stone walls and pleasant atmosphere. Bar menu was approachable, staff attentive and friendly..( yes it does make a bit of a difference if you speak french LOL ). Price points were normal and the food was very good. I'd like to return for diner and/or a longer sunday brunch of yummmm..."

Cozy, not too much noise. We were seated at the bar (due to fully booked), the waiter helped us out on the menu and provided great advice.The food are amazing.We first started with the meat platter with tomota bread. 4 different kind of meat, every slice were full of flavor.Then we added a croquette, we weren't sure which one to order so our waiter suggest a mix of each: 1 Ham, 1 beef & 1 fish.When I first look at the 3 pieces, I imagined the texture to be hard fried but to my surprise, it's actually thin layer crispy on the outside, super soft, smooth on the inside. Try it! You'll not regret!The poella, we have the chicken seafood poella rice. The shrimp are amazing, the fish are great... My only disappointment... The dish was over salty. But it's still very good regardless.Little tips for you : be sure to make a reservation before going :)"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"FANTASTIC FOOD! I simply adored the Spanish tapas experience. Limited menu but everything on it is excellent.The Iberian ham was simply divine! We went with their cold cut platter and the chorizo and ham blew us away! Beautifully presented on a gorgeous wooden plate. My only regret is that it's kind-of pricey and something to eat by yourself or to be shared with another person. Not for 4 people as the waitress suggested.I'm a huge fan of patatas bravas and it was so good. Nice little plate filled with yummies. I would suggest more dressing, it was a little sparse.We also went with the friend zucchini plates that were stuffed with ricotta and chorizo and they were delicious!Main plate was the vegetarian paella and it was great. This plate can be shared for 4 people. For dessert I went with their Spanish creme brulee, it was just OK.Solid experience."
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,"Went for brunch in a group of 8 for a UYE- Unofficial Yelp Event. I reserved our table the very night before our set date, (truthfully because I kept forgetting the previous evenings while they were open), the reservation was quick and painless and there was no issues with my last minute stunt. Showing up for opening time the following day (Saturday), we saw we didn't quite necessarily need the reservation, we had the place pretty much to ourselves for most of our brunch. We all had such a good time eating and chatting, we stayed a good 2 hours, I believe, and no one made us feel rushed or unwelcome. Food, some 5 star affairs. Some pretty unfortunate and blatant 3 star affairs. One unfortunate disastrous odour, imo. The unpredictability of a good menu choice and the awful odour inflicted upon the whole is where I remove the half a star. So, 4.5 stars rounded up. I really appreciated the pricing and options of their brunch menu, for 20$ you choose an entrée and a main which comes with a side. However, coffee not included in that price and they don't have filtre coffee.Unfortunately I was quite disappointed with the ""café au lait"" I did order, they brought me a latté instead (even though they stated yes when I asked if they had café au lait, yes there's a difference ppl) and it was a very weak, small latté at that. I didn't catch the price, but next time I'll just stick w water, wine or mimosas. For my choices I had the eggs benedict, side of brussel sprout salad and entrée of charcuterie. One of my friends was sure to order the other side option (fruit salad) and a different entrée (the cheese platter) and we shared everything. Meats and cheeses: phenomenal!!! Soooo coming back here specifically for wine n charcuterie and cheese! They do this soooooo well here I can't begin to describe, the meats melt away in your mouth like butter, the cheeses are individually unique and globally perfect, including the lovely little (we believe rhubarb?) jam that accompanied. If not for anything just come for these! Hollandaise for my main was watery, bland and definitely wayyy not enough. Poached eggs too bland for the deep fried cornbread patties they were served on, not enough meat for the cornbread, but when I scraped off all the meat and egg and hollandaise off to eat separately for the 2nd half it was a lot more flavourful and enjoyable. The cornbread really dulls this whole plate and should consider being replaced. The brussel sprout salad entrée was divine! I would order that a thousand times over, it was definitely better than the fruit salad imo. My friend ordered the Tota? Torta? I can't remember the name of it, but we shared bites with most of the table and everyone agreed: he won brunch. It was a fried egg-based potato casserole and he paid the extra 4$ surcharge to have it with Ibericos ham - definitely the right choice. If this is on their brunch menu do not even hesitate on any other choice, just order this and send me a thank you after. Just as we finished eating, the table next to us ordered/received their paella for the family served in a huge skillet...the overwhelming odour of pungent fish invaded the whole dining area and my friend insisted I go outside for respite because as someone who doesn't like fish, it was just all too much for me to bare. 10 minutes later the odour had subsided enough to be tolerable, but had I still been eating when it arrived it would have certainly ruined my meal. At one point my friend dropped his fork, no harm no foul, he just simply picked it back up and put it aside to ask for a new one. Before we even got the chance, one of the super efficient ladies serving us appears out of no where with both a fork and knife in hand inquiring which utensil needed replacement. We were floored. (Pun intended, why not.) That never happens in a restaurant. Ever. These people don't wait to be told or asked to do their job, they are always listening and paying attention to their customers and what you're saying which is a highly impressive quality I barely see at $$$ + establishments let alone an affordable bargain like this spot. So yes, I highly recommend checking out this tapas spot. Make sure to order many items, that way the 3 star affairs don't underwhelm and undermine the 5 star recognition this place actually deserves. And while most people freak out about the Ibericos Ham, if you have to choose, I really must insist the Chorizo is the better way to go: that stuff is killer addictive!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Since visiting Spain 4 years ago, I have never found comparable spanish food in Montreal...until now.This restaurant is informal yet serves highly refined tapas that showcase premium ingredients prepared carefully and properly. Their tomato bread is extremely fresh and exploding with flavour. It consists of toasted bread rubbed with garlic and tomato. They then spread a thin layer of the tomato pulp atop the grilled bread slightly blurring the lines into bruschetta territory. We took one look at the bread on the table next to us and asked the waiter for 2 orders as soon as we sat down. I love my wife, but some things in life (such as spanish tomato bread) don't need to be shared. On this basis alone, Ibericos qualifies for 5 Yelp stars in my opinion. I reserve this designation for those restaurants that provide a flawlessly executed dish that is not readily available anywhere else. They are providing a public service which deserves recognition.We ordered generously sampling the mixed charcuterie plate with the belotta ham, the bravas potatoes, the shrimp in garlic sauce, the fried zucchini flowers, the salad, some grilled octopus, and finally the seafood and chicken paella for 2.Everything was spectacular. I'm always down for an oversized platter of cured meat and Ibericos really knocks it out of the park. Other standouts include the bravas which arrive deep fried with garlic and sweet red pepper sauces. We could have easily ordered another one, but it's just as well that we didn't since you want to sample as many items as possible. The zucchini flowers were the best tapa of the night for me. Lightly battered in a tempura-like coating, the flowers were stuffed with goat cheese and an almost liquified chorizo paste. Every bite of this dish is a powerful jolt to the senses; Crispy, sweet, salty, hot..... the dish has everything!The other star of night has to be the garlic shrimp. For 14$, you get 6 sautéed shrimp served in a rich sauce bursting with garlic. Accompanied by 2 pieces of fresh bread to mop up the sauce, this tapa is perfection. This is another reason why Ibericos gets the 5 star rating.The salad was unfortunately a letdown. The lettuce tasted wilted, there was very little texture, and the dressing was mild, tasteless and forgettable. Can I safely attribute responsibility for the salad to my wife who ordered it? The Spanish are not known for their salads. Order appropriately for the restaurant you are sitting in. Trying to recreate your perfect routine meal regardless of the dining establishment seldom works out well. So many people try to do this, and ultimately they are the ones who suffer through a dish that a given restaurant doesn't do properly. She'll probably read this and say ""but I liked the salad!?!"". It wasn't good. Enough said.Their octopus is excellent and bursting with grilled flavour served on a light gazpacho-like puddle. It was probably a little more firm than I prefer, but I'm not sure that this isn't by design.  I will say that the best and most flavourful and tender octopus in Montreal is served at Lezvos on Decarie. Finally, the paella was delicious and very well seasoned. It includes about 6 shrimp, mussels, scallops, as well as a few pieces of roasted chicken. I might have added a little bit of chorizo to mix. The rice was extremely filling. Next time, I might just ask for an extra order of the garlic shrimp, tomato bread, or zucchini flowers instead.We'll definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Like being transported to an authentic Museo del Jamón mixed with a Tapas bar in Madrid's Plaza Mayor, this space fits right into character. Stone walls adorned with gold foil wrapped namesake cured ham legs and lovely staff dressed in red and black fit perfectly with the décor.What else was on point is a long list of things: beginning with their namesake ham - silky smooth, rich in color and taste. Same went for the memorable Chorizo, salami, sausage and the oh so Manchego cheese. That was just the starter of a two-course brunch menu they offer on weekends from 11:30am-2:30pm for $20 (several options are given for starters and mains - though not too many to dilute their focus). Two pieces of bread with a tasty Tomato based spread accompanied said meat(s) and cheese board. Soon after was the perfect time for Mimosa makings to arrive, helping wash the deliciousness down (a shout out to Patrick B. for offering our table a glass each).The second course came out in a timely fashion and was served with grace. From what I can recall three options were ordered and tried. They included: Several orders of 'ham' Benedict, with a not too creamy Hollandaise and nicely poached eggs, atop fried Arepas instead of English muffins (very cool sub). A spinach infused waffle (my order), Pacific smoked salmon, cream cheese, caper and caramelized onion stack (more like a sandwich, but stack sounds more chic). Plus, Pat selected the potato, meat and sauce skillet, which tasted pretty 'bleeping' awesome.All were excellent - in a nutshell --- and served with one of two sides served in Tapas sized bowls (just realized this upon reflection, cool).About half got a nice looking fruit bowl, and the other the more 'adventurous' Brussels sprouts number. I thought this was one of the highlights of a great overall meal; perfectly cooked/steamed sprouts, toasted chestnuts, diced apricots (or the like), and a light dressing. Now where do I buy one of their transporters, oh wait, no need it's all in their dining room. What a nice brunch experience. Gracias to my tablemates and to the staff for making it so. Bravo - that sounds right."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Happy Easter weekend! We were 8 to enjoy a lovely brunch in a Spanish restaurant. Take a step inside, you have been transported to another world. The decoration has an old rusty feel to it with a nice touch of modern architecture. There were three dry piece of porks in front of the window where the entrance is. The waitresses were nice to introduced us to the best dishes in the menu. I took the Or mixte which has a iberico meat, the mangenco cheese and chorizo meat. It was a hard choices between the benedict and the green waffle. I took the former and I got what look like a mixture of a Benedict hollandaise poarch eggs top on potatoes galettes. The side dish is a small bowl of fruits. To complete the whole meal, we had a mimosa to drink. Everything is good except the potatoes galettes. It was a bit hard to munch on it but I managed to finish it. It is, unfortunately, my least favourite part of the whole meal. The service was great, the waitresses are gorgeous and the food was more than amazing despite the potatos galettes."

Compared to other places I have tried this was a bit disappointing. We had to wait about 20 mins till someone acknowledged us - which isn't a great start.To start we had one serving of the charcuterie and cheese platter and one serving of the cod fritters. The charcuterie was average, the cheese unimppresive but the cod fritters were one the best I ever had. For the main course we had the vegetable paella and the pork cheek. The pork cheek was very delicate and the entire dish was very well balanced. The paella on the other hand was once again disappointing and rather bland. The desserts were a disaster. They might have scored another star if not for the dessert and service. The fried egg plant with honey was alright but the cheese killed it for me. As for the chocolate ganache, it was a total fail. It is also not something they offer on their usual menu so maybe that's why.I would go back here however because I did have a good experience earlier when I tried the a la carte menu but they completely failed in being part of Mtl a table whole heartedly."
/user_details?userid=dcJeQ2EyL0VfWVG7rQ1kAQ,Leo G.,"Phoenixville, PA",5 star rating,"Most highly recommend.  Marvelous dining experience at Haissim's intimate, cozy, first-rate Ibericos.  Don't be fooled by the relatively low number of Yelp reviews, as Ibericos is only 3 years old, but is already a gem.My wife and I chose the Tasting Menu comprised of charcuterie, 4 tapas, seafood paella (or noodles), cheese plank and a dessert.  Eduardo selected a light red wine to complement this.  The 4 tapas of chef's choice were: oxtail with mushrooms croquette; cod puree croquette with honey; morilles a la creme with noix de pin and epinettes; and a salad of cooked tetes de violons (fiddleheads) with jambon and manchego.  All were superb.The 4 characuterie meats melted in the mouth, very flavorful and not too salty.  The tapas were highly imaginative and thrilled the palate with its uniquely combined flavors.The seafood and chicken paella was served in a traditional iron pan, which is what made us decide to visit Ibericos for the first time.  I have never had such deliciously seasoned shrimp, complementing tender mussels (mouilles), fish, and chicken wings.  After a small plank of sliced manchego cheese paired with quince, the masterpiece of a dessert ended our meal on a high note --- chocolate ganache topped with a squiggle of frosting-like olive oil and sea salt, served with a thin chip.  Haissim explained it is a mother's afternoon snack showing her love for her child; I interpreted this to mean despite what little he might have on hand, she could imaginatively whip up a delightful treat.We will definitely be back!"

This resto is really a cozy warm resto nestled in the heart of the plateau. It is a spanish tapas resto so I strongly recommend going in group of max 8 and doing a sharing dishes concept..this is the best way to get to taste their delicious dishes. Do not attempt to go with picky eaters as this often times ruins the whole tapas experience. The resto itself is small but beautifully decored with giant wooden wine barrels used for the hightables for two. The service was warm and friendly. The food was delicious!  We shared 8 dishes among 4 people and it was fillling. You can always order more if still hungry. What really made this resto stand out from other tapas resto was the imported iberico serrano jamon(prosciutto like) but much better! The iberico ham served on toasted fresh bread was absolutely delicious!! The serrano ham just melted in your mouth!  We truly enjoyed this! We also sampled their delicious sangria! They also have an outdoor terrasse for the summer ! Great place for friend's night out, romantic date and 5 @7!"

We were four people and we shared everything. We had the Ibéricos charcuterie platter which consisted of Ibérico ham, chorizo, salchichón, and lomo. We also ordered an extra 30 g Ibérico ham because I love that stuff. The charcuterie was good but two of them tasted like salami to me and honestly I've had better cured ham at the resto Barocco. We also had the queso (cheese) platter which consisted of 6 month and 12 month cured manchego, Ibérico, and goat cheese. It was all very good. The charcuterie and cheese platters came with Pa Amb Tomàquet which is tomato bread with extra virgin olive oil on top. I don't like to carb up but it was so good that I had two. We shared the seafood and chicken paella for two people. It was big enough. It was very flavorful but a bit salty and oily for my liking. We also had the Pulpo a la Gallega  which is grilled octopus on a potato bed and sprinkled with paprika, olive oil, and Maldon salt. It was ok. I've had better grilled octopus. Sadly they ran out of the grilled calamari. The waiter recommended the Canelones de Rabo de Toro (braised oxtail cannelloni with béchamel sauce) because he said it was his favorite on the menu. It was my favorite thing on the menu too. The drinks were good. We had a pitcher of red sangria and I also got a glass of the white sangria."

I had brunch there and the server forgot to bring me the salad it came with. I also had to wait to be seated for a little bit but the food was good for a reasonable price.

We had oxtails 2 ways, in fried croquettes and in canalones with a bechamel sauce. Tasty! Also the Spanish fries w/2 sauces (romesco and garlic mayo).Shrimp with garlic, Pork and squid meatballs (neglected to tell my sons that they had squid in them - hehehehehe, they enjoyed them nonetheless). And then we get to the ham. We got a mix of 4 different pork products, along with 2 different aged Manchego cheese plus a 3rd cheese. And some tomato bread. Grill some bread, then rub a half of a tomato on the bread, followed with a drizzle of very good Spanish olive oil. Kids loved this place."
