We really enjoyed the grilled shrimp specifically * Cozy and warm vibe, good place to start trying Vietnamese cuisine. * Will definitely come back !"
/user_details?userid=Lv_0rSlLDOhHBhptr3ejig,Marie-Michele N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We were dying for a good old Pho Soup. We found this place on Yelp that seemed decent so Covid obliges, we ordered take out Pho Soups - one chicken and one beef. The meat was fantabulous (we only eat meat once a month so when we eat it, it better be good). The chicken was grilled and juicy; the bouillon not too salty. There were a lot of veggies in the chicken Pho Soup that were cooked al dente.  I did wonder why they were cutting the vegetables like the McCain Super French Fries - Crinkle Cut. Normally this announces frozen vegetables... but clearly the veggies were fresh. The gentleman who served us was nice and fast. Too bad we could not eat inside the restaurant as unlike other typical Pho Soup restaurants, this one was cute and cozy. Perhaps there is a tiny adjustment to be made on the quantity of spicy sauce and fresh herbs provided with the soups. If you go there, please make sure to ask for extra!"

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally tried out this recently opened resto located on Boul. St. Laurent with a group of foodie friends and enjoyed the experience!  The resto itself is small but can accommodate max group of 8 people. The resto is beautifully decorated and really does give you a homey feeling. It's perfect for a first date, date night, anniversary or birthday celebrations. Service is friendly and fast. Now before I get to the food review...I must mention that if you are a group of 8 and are sitting in the back section, you must remove your shoes to sit in that area. I was taken aback by this at first but luckily we all had our socks on!  If you are less than 8 , you can sit at the normal sections and can KEEP your shoes on !  LOL!  Now for the food..the dishes were absolutely delicious!!! We started with the vegetarian spring rolls which were super tasty ..perfectly crispy! I then ordered the ""PHO"" soup with beef flank which was awesome!  Super delicious flavors and the broth was perfect , not too salty! They also have a great cocktail menu ..I had the blue lagoon which was so pretty and great! We also had the vietnamese cold coffee which was refreshing!! Overall, it was a great experience and not expensive at all for great quality food!!"

/user_details?userid=kFU-6F3fVqQGNa9mHiaLFA,Matt G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,This is the place to go! My friend and I felt really exhausted from the brutally cold weather and were just looking for some warming comfort food. This place went above and beyond in delivering! I got the chicken pho and my friend got the tofu pho. We both agreed it was some of the best pho we have ever eaten! If you want a really amazing bowl of noodle soup you need to come here!
