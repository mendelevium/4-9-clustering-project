We cautiously ordered it here and managed our expectations but were blown away.  We were instantly transported back to the central market in Valencia. Absolutely stunning. Next came the paella de mariscos- seafood paella.  We ordered an order for one and split it (so we'd have room for dessert- SO glad we did). Oh, the imported Spanish rice was just as we remembered, and seasoning was perfect - a little smokey with just the right amount of saffron with fresh seafood- shrimps, mussels, and calamari cooked perfectly.  EAT HERE (or take it home) - we did both!"

I paid half price and still feel a bit robbed. Buying them at $20 sth would just be ridiculous."

Two of us shared paella and potatoes brava, was enough for both of us. The high top tables make the spot really casual, we hung out for a while and played cards."
