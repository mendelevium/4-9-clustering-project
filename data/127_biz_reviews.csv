Here's the menu: Miso SoupBibimbapGyu-sushi (they didn't have so they subbed Octopus Balls) Gyu-Kaku salad Kalbi Short RibSkirt SteakFilet MignonRibeyeShiro Cabbage Chicken Thighs Shrimp GarlicBroccoli with Cheese OMG. Everything, I mean everything was just top-notch. Our favourite was the different steaks with rib eye coming at number 1! We also loved the shrimp. What was most surprising was the Salad. We are definitely not salad eaters but the dressing was amazing and it actually had more than just lettuce, they added boiled eggs and cucumbers. Delicious. Other items we really enjoyed were the Bibimbap and Yokotaki (octopus balls). Flavours were so great! It was about $115 which in my opinion was totallt worth it. They are also very helpful in explaining how long to cook the meat for and related safety precautions. COVID: they are very serious which is exactly what I want when going to a restaurant nowadays. You have to reserve before coming. They check your temperature and ask you to sanitize before going in. They have very limited seating too. We saw about 5 tables and they are far apart. Other tables are not used at all. All servers are wearing masks and enforce it when you get up from the table."
/user_details?userid=LiD311vn_95gf_IJYjrjuA,Dawei L.,"Quebec City, Canada",5 star rating,"First time eating out since March, goodness I missed having Japanese cuisine.Ordered the 84$ course. It came with meats like filet mignon, new york steaks and a fee other kind of beef which I can't quite remember the names. The meats are well seasoned and are extremely tender and delicious as long as you make sure not to cook it pass medium. Personaly, I like having it medium rare to make it tender and juicy. The course also came with a salade which was nice. The course also came with a chicken karaage. It was perfectly fried to the perfect crunchyness. Covid-19 measures: The restaurant will check your temperature before been seated which I think was an important measure to make sure everyone is safe. The each next seat is closed to unsure minimum distance between each table. Chopsticks, napkins and ustinsil are one time use. Soy sauce, vinaiger and spicy sauce are packed in one time use small plastic cups."

I ordered two bowl one beef rice and one build you own bento.  The rice bowl came with miso soup or salad. The bento came with two meats and two side dishes and both soup and salad. I chose fired chicken and octopus ball. The soup was tasty. The beef bowl has more favour. The bento meat should be dipped in the sauce which comes with the delivery. Two sauces were tasty, good for the rice too. I like everything except the salad. The quality of the salad was bad and I found mould on the cherry tomato."

The food was absolutely delicious, me and my BF got the 55$ menu meant for 2 people and we were very happy with everything we got! That combo is a mix of different type of high quality meat, salads and vegetables, bimbimbab and miso soup.The service was great, our waitress was very friendly and attentious. The music was very upbeat and overall we really loved the place. Recommend!"
/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I was meeting a friend downtown for supper, I told her to pick a place. She brought us here. I was a bit worried, first because I don't like Asian food in general, second I couldn't quite understand the concept of cooking your own food. Anyways, I went along. We had reservations at 7:45 but got there really early 6:30. The waitress was kind enough to accommodate us and give us a table. Our waiter came by and quickly explained the concept. Basically you ordered what you want from the menu (veggies, meat, poultry, seafood) they bring it raw and you BBQ it yourself. We ordered beef toro, yaki shabu beef and chicken thigh. We also ordered a gyu-kamu salad, which was mixed greens with cucumber, red peppers tomato and eggs. With an egg dressing.  The waiter was very kind and attentive, brought us the different dishes, turned on the bbq, put some oil on and we were ready to grill. The meat is cut very thin so it cooks very quickly, chicken takes 4-5 min to cook which the waiter tells us in advance. I loved the marinate, service was impeccable, our glass of water was never empty. If the grill gets to burnt you just tell the waiter and he changes the grill.You can even make your own s'mores, they bring you marshmallows, Hershey chocolate and the cookies.  We had some tea at the end of our meal which help digestion.A great experience for my first time, I will be definitely coming back"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"In Montreal on business and we need lunch! My coworker and I just flew in then I spotted Gyu-Kaka on Yelp with some excellent reviews so we decided to stop in!Atmosphere/Appearance: Right off of a busy side street with some low-key signage out front is this place. Inside is so modern. It's chic, but definitely has an upscale oriental feel. The tables are so spaced out, there's a cool uneven brick pattern, there's graffiti, I mean each section of the restaurant has its own personality. I loved it.Service: Lauren took excellent care of us. She was quick, helpful and got us everything that we needed. Phillip aided her and was also a big help when teaching us how to grill certain items.Food: So this is one of those infamous Korean BBQ places where you cook your own food right on a grill built into the table. We came on a Monday which is all-day happy hour! How awesome is that?! So for one set price (per person) you get miso soup, a Gyu-Kaka Salad, Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap and steamed dumplings to share. That was plenty of food already, but then comes the good stuff! You get hanger steak, filet mignon, Yaki-Shabu beef, Toro beef, chicken thighs and vegetables to grill up. Everything was so delicious and tasty. The portions were good and I had no complaints.Value: (All prices in CAD$.) So happy hour is only $55.00 per person but it's about $74.50 worth of food and I'd totally agree. Everything you need comes all included. You can't beat it!In conclusion I absolutely loved this place and am happy we ran into it. I'd totally come back to try out happy hour or even once of the bigger dinners in the future!"
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",4 star rating,"Been here on 2 occasions. First time was with 3 others. 2 people ordered a la carte, while myself and another got the kabuki menu. It is written intended for 3 people but my dining partner said he'd heard the servings were small, so it'd probably be fine for the 2 of us (this was an incorrect assumption lol. We had extra).The kabuki menu came with salad and fried calamari to start. The salad had a sesame dressing, cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes, greens, and egg. It was refreshing and crisp, no complaints. The squid was cruncy and tender and had a spicy mayo dip. Then we got grilling! It's a japanese style grill, with a mesh like surface and what looks like charcoal below. The servers brush it with oil and give you a rundown of how to time your meats. They advise you not to cook too many things...the heat doesn't seem to be that strong so if you crowd it, things will take forever. Being the impatient and scatterbrained and hangry people we were, we just left things on the grill for an arbitrary time until they were cooked through. The beef was very good, properly marinated and tenderized. The chicken and pork were very enjoyable as well and not at all too spicy. The shrimp were great! I really liked the garlic marinade. The veggies definitely needed more time though. I think doing one packet at a time would be better.The next time I went with one other person. We got the meat lovers set for 65. The miso soup was very good, much better than the standard ones you gt with sushi sets, and had seaweed and tofu in it. The salad was still good. The fried chicken was very tender and moist but quite boney, and you might find the texture unusual if you're used to chicken breast. Of the meats, I loved the super fatty beef toro the most. That marbling was great, with just a quick char on the grill. It came with a dipping sauce that tasted like mirin and soy. The other beef was goood too, though I didn't like the filet mignon that much. Too much white pepper. The mushrooms and broccoli took a while to cook, and had a butter sauce which was pretty yum. There was also a beef bibimbap, which was mixed tableside in a hot stone bowl. The rice was very good, though quite salty, and the beef rather sweet. As a bonus for checking in, we also got free spring rolls! These were properly crispy and hot. The dipping sauces provided include ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy. My faves were the last 2.Service was very good the first time I went, with our grills changed frequently and water refilled. The second time was a bit lacking. The restaurant was nearly empty and there weren't many staff, which is understandable since this was during the beginning of the outbreak. The staff told us about the happy hour deals which sounded fantastic! I think I'll definitely return. It's a bit pricey normally, probably around 40pp without drinks, but happy hour specials are much cheaper!"
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is one of the nicest asian bbq places I've found in Montreal.  The 'cook your own' formula is always pleasant. Great selection of meats and vegetables to choose from. I do think however there must be better meat than what was recommended by staff so I'll have to be back to discover  the gems on the menu. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. Cheers!
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There are over six hundred Gyu-Kakus in Japan so I say, if it's good enough for the Japanese--it's good enough for me! The first time I went, it was for the happy hour which starts after 9pm.  We had gone earlier but they were full so we took the earliest table available which was at 9. The second time I went, I took a reservation online so we had a chance to eat at a normal supper time! First thing you'll notice is how friendly the staff are. From the hosts at the front to the servers...we had 3 come by and ask us if we wanted to order anything. We went for the Regular Meat Lovers for 2. Listen, there is a reason why the better meats cost more--it's cause they just taste so much damn better!! Here's how I ranked the meats in terms of taste and texture (before I looked at the price) and you'll see the trend:1) Kalbi Chuck Rib $8.502) Bistro Hangar Steak $103) Yaki-Shabu $5.504) New York Steak $8 but to be fair, I overcooked it so that's why it's ranked lower. If it were done just right, I think it would've taken 3rd place!5) Toro Beef $6 it was super tendony... Had to pull while taking a bite.6) Spicy Pork $5.50 it was way too spicy for me!!Maybe next time, I'll try the premium meat lover combo.  The salad is really refreshing and we saved half of it for after the meats to balance out the meal after all that grilling.Also don't be like me and overcook the meat! Instead, refer to the Grill Guide in the middle of the menu to know where and how much time to cook each item!!I really, really liked the fried chicken karaage. It was fried so light and crispy it puts Colonel Sanders to shame cause most of the times I get KFC, the chicken skin be soggy with oil.Black sesame ice cream is so yummy. I prefer it over green tea which is so...pedestrian (at least in Asia)! Anyway, it is a touch pricey considering the volume of meat you get and that you gotta cook your own food but otherwise, it's a good accessorized meal that is sure to fill you up :p"

There were three of us so we ordered the three person BBQ course. There was a lot of food and if your party is not meat lovers or can't eat a lot then I would suggest ordering the two person course for three people. Overall, the food was good and service was good. They kept coming around to change our grill which was nice."

We were 3 and it was our first time so we opted for the 3 people set meal.Meat quality was decent but really nothing extraordinary about this place. Everything taste decent but if you are looking for something to wow you, then it's not for you.The decor is nice and service was friendly. Our waitress came to change our grill multiple times without us having to ask (some other places, you need to beg them to change your grill!).Our set was $80 but if you come for happy hours, it's cheaper. I think it's worth it for happy hour but not so much for dinner...at least not the sets. Should order a la carte."

I've been here three times, mostly for celebratory dinners with parents/visiting friends. It is usually slightly too much food, but that doesn't bother me!The happy hour is a great deal: incredibly generous in both food portions and timing (it's twice a day, and all day on Monday).However, it can be expensive and very hard to get in--the first time, I was told there was a TWO AND A HALF HOUR WAIT?? The second time, I booked a table for 8:45 and didn't get seated until 9pm. That's my main issue with the place, to be honest."

I went there with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day dinner and it did not disappoint. Although on the slightly pricier side, we had a lot of food for two (we had ordered a Valentine's day special combo for 2). A large variety of seasoned meat and side dishes. The waiter was very kind and professional. He explained how things worked and what food was brought to our table.All in all a fantastic experience and would go back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=iF_nTUa6rS-o7MfFHD1dNg,Alice F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4 star rating,"I'll admit it, I like this chain. I'm not usually a chain person, and I may lose some foodie cred with a couple friends, but when I see a Gyu-Kaku, I inevitably end up there. This location is one of the better ones, and like others, get a reservation and don't even try to come here alone! Japanese barbecue is for groups! Reliable options are the fried bacon chips, karaage, harami steak, beef tongue, kalbi, beef toro and pork belly. Service here was a bit slow, but they were apologetic and offered some freebies to make up for it. They were attentive with changing out the grill and giving instructions on cooking. The drinks are very sweet, so I usually stick to beer or sake. Come during happy hour and it's a great deal! But don't forget to bring friends."

I went for the weekday ""Happy Hour"" set menu lunch at a discounted price of $55 for 2 people.  Came out satisfied, but not entirely full, and with a bill of $70 all in, this without any drinks. This is not what I call a cheap lunch.   Perhaps, this is how the term flexitarian originated. Great service and good quality meat are the two things that will make me come back again."

We have tried SHOGU - set menu for six people and it was an excellent choice. The service was attentive and great, although, it was a little bit annoying when some of the staff only spoke to us in English considering we had a francophone group and ordered in French. The food was great and I really like the variety of dishes. It's definitely a good place to visit with friends or to celebrate a special occasion."

/user_details?userid=d0KPlnRsT8uwmE_F85pNfw,Miranda B.,"Barnstable, MA",5 star rating,I love Gyu-Kaku so much! This location was no exception. My date and I ordered the meat lover's and miso soup. We also got free vegetable rolls for checking in on Yelp (you don't need to write a review). Everything was so delicious. We had so much fun grilling out meat to perfection and it tastes so good with the rice and sauces. Also got some drinks which didn't taste great but certainly got us tipsy. It was a really fun experience and I definitely recommend it if you're looking to splurge for a nice night out. We ended up spending ~$120 here but it really was worth it.

Meat selection was on point and tasted super fresh.  Frankly I just prefer Korean but it wasn't a disappointment. All the cuts were fresh and tasty. I'd do 3.5 for the mediocre edamame, meat sashimi, gamey meat and the veggie foil baskets that were just ... meh. Those little things matter. I'd return but probably won't since I don't live here."

/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been to several BBQ places in Montreal...and I have to say the experience I had at Guy-Kaku Japanese BBQ definitely trumps other ones.  The waiters were attentive and energetic. They refilled our drinks regularly and changed our grill 3 times.   We had Meat Lovers combo set. Quality of the meat were excellent! Portions were right on too. The waiter even explained to us how many seconds or minutes we should do for different types of meat. The portion of the salad is right on too. Perfect. The rice that comes in a bowl was just ok. A bit dry, maybe it was just a one-off type of thing, which is not a big deal since everything else is just superb. Plus, usually our clothes get very smelly after a BBQ meal because of all the smokes from the grill, but not so much at this restaurant. Not really sure why, maybe they had better ventilation system? or the fact that they change the grill often to avoid the over burn smell? Whatever they are doing, it is great! It makes us feeling clean. The whole experience feels like a clean eating rather than oily and greasy. This place can be a great place for a date I would say.  For the experience and the quality and the service. 5 stars!  I am a happy customer!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Guys. I'm blown away by experiences at Gyu-Kaku. They have (mostly) good service, and I loved the simple but cool decor, along with the fact that between each group of four, they had a wooden panel separating us. Great for privacy! 2 of us split the $70 Geisha package. It might not be #AYCE but the package included SO MUCH FOOD, to the point where we didn't know where to fit stuff on our table anymore! The Gyu-Kaku salad and the ""beef bibimbap"", were good ways to start the meal. I love the meats provided for grilling (filet mignon + kalbi chuck rib + harami miso skirt steak + rib eye steak + marinated chicken). The skirt steak was the best - super tender and the marinade was delicious. The chicken karaage was yummy but on the salty side.The second time I visited Gyu-Kaku, we split the package meal for 4 since this way, you get to try a little of everything without having to make any decisions after a long day at work! My fave menu items are the beef garlic noodles and the grilled meats listed above. However, the tuna was cut too thick for our liking, the shrimps weren't deveined properly, and I found the steamed veggies to be too bland/soggy. The steamed broccoli and vegetables ready for the grill were better. The ice cream at the end of the meal was very refreshing and tasted like good quality green tea. I really like their app, where the more you spend, the more you earn and the quicker you can redeem your points. I have already been back three times now and I'll be back!"

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a Japanese chain beloved by my Japanese friends, it had been on my radar for a while so I jumped at the chance when they invited us for a family feast. I was a little worried about going here as a vegetarian, because it's a BBQ joint basically, and not geared towards the veg necessarily, but we rolled in with a crew of 10 including kids and grandparents and everyone feasted like champs. The meat lovers were very happy, the meats are very high quality and the bbq built into the table means everyone gets to cook it how they like. The family combos are a great deal and they take a lot of the guesswork out of getting enough food in the right combinations. The vegetarians ordered vegetable garlic noodles and tofu chigae and some mushrooms and peppers for the bbq. The chigae came out with meat so we were a bit bummed at first but our waiter whisked it away and came back with a vegetarian one without blinking an eye. And the garlic noodles were super delish! The service was great. Super warm and friendly and fun and fast. The manage came to say hi, and then came back with 2 of his staff and sang happy birthday to the kiddo who was celebrating and gave her a cute crown and a s'more to bbq for dessert. All in all a super fun and tasty family experience. Definitely book ahead, they filled up by 11:30am!"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just as high quality as I thought it would be. Been to another one in Hong Kong several years ago and it was just as good if not better.First of all, I came here without a reservation on a Saturday night (past 9:30pm) and waited for almost an hour, then left. Came again on a Monday with reservation and was seated quickly. IMPORTANT: reserve a spot AND come during ""happy hour"" which is all Monday or after peak hours. The prices are significantly lower and you obvs don't need to spend more than you should.We ordered a happy hour set for two and there was a great selection of appetizers, meats, and vegetables. There were definitely other things on the menu that I wanted to try but honestly I'm glad I got the set that provided a well-rounded meal. I found the filet mignon and corn particularly delicious. Brocoli could be less salty though, as well as some meats. Also hoped for tea refills but they didn't have enough. The meats were not overly marinated and the grilling process was super easy. In contrast to kbbq, there's not a lot of smoke and doesn't leave you in an outfit of barbecue scented clothes. Anyways, atmosphere was hip and comfortable, with lots of room for food on your table. The booths are also spacious and gives you plenty of room between guests. They play a banging playlist that's like alternative electronic that's not too mainstream. In addition, get the app! It's weird to have a restaurant that makes an app but you can get yourself some free food by just signing up."

We got our food pretty quickly and honestly the ambiance was great. Love the going back and fro with the chefs!Honestly, this is a 5 star experience however the only thing that bothered me is that I found several plates a little small. If the plates were a little more filled with meat I would be far happier with my experience. Having 1 or 2 pieces per plate left me wanting and when I left, I was still a little hungry."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"A recent UYE took us to testing out this new addition to our fair city. Location: Out of this world smack dab in a great spot just south of St Cath on Crescent in the Central part of downtown. Cleanliness: being a JBBQ place these tend to be a bit smoky, however place is new modern and you barely get any aroma of smoky soy sauce meat being grilled. Perfect exhaust fans around the grills do a fantastic just of keeping the smoke and aroma under control.Price: Depending on what you choose and eat expect to pay in the $30-50 range pp for dinner. They do have group dinner meal prices. Value is a tad better as it's a whole meal deal. We ordered the $140 for 4 people plus a pitcher of Sapporo. With tax and 15% tip on my visit I was $49.25. In Montreal there is already a plethora of Korean BBQ places and this popular chain is a new addition for Japanese BBQ. For me K and J BBQ are close cousins. Many of them are 3* to me as they lack on service or quality of meat or both. Call me a snob but I've been fortunate to have my fair share of excellent KBBQ & JBBQ. Places I've fondly enjoyed in other cities are where it's AYCE and a huge cold buffet and you fill up a massive mountain of Bulgogi, Seafood, Kalbi and then grill it at your table like a hungry caveman. Other establishments they have menu items and bring out as much as you want till the meat sweats start after about hour 1.5. Other Asian BBQ joints its AYCE sushi mixed in with BBQ. Lastly some of the places in Asia they mix in AYCD (drink) to wet the mouth as you are eating copious quantities of meat. These places tend to be the loudest as patrons inhibitions get lost in the beer.Here at Gyu Kaku the focus I would declare is on very high quality meats. They don't serve huge quantities per dish however the meat is of very high quality. Juicy flavourful and downright delish.  They do pre-warn you as you enter the place. It's a 2 hour limit for dining. Another positive is the seasoning of the meat is not overly salty with soy sauce or sweet. Seasoning was actually about right in my opinion. Starting off with salad and then onto the meats. I believe it was the kalbi and ribeye which were one of the first served were the best. The garlic noodles I could have eaten the whole bowl! Then plate after plate of more meat. Quite a bit more! Some veggies and they ended off the meal with the chicken (very smart as you don't want to contaminate and mix meats). Everything was planned out and food came out fast. You have a choice of ice cream as dessert and my green tea was nice to finish off. Service was very attentive and professional. Only downside i would say is portion size per plate is a bit small. The veggie plates could have been a bit more plentiful. However they do serve you quite a bit of variety. Also after the meal I didn't feel super full however 20 mon after it set in and I was stuffed. Kind of like a creep up on you content full feeling.Definitely a place I look forward to returning again and an overall pleasant higher end Asian BBQ dining experience. Make reservations... it's a popular place."

This is not an AYCE BBQ so the quality is great! All very tasty especially when you combine with their home made sauce. Service wise... Ummmm it is still fairly new, they seems a bit messy at times... And they will not give you a table until all the attendees arrives even if you made a reservation. I just hope they can get better with times.Price wise, it's more than fair in my opinion. They have different combos for you choose and their combo usually includes plenty of appetizers and desserts.I strongly recommend this restaurant"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My foodie group and I visited this Japanese BBQ last night and overall, we really enjoyed it. First off, we were 16 people, we sat at two tables of 8 and management was really accommodating when we asked for separate bills, which apparently goes against their one bill policy for groups of 8 or more, so really thankful for that! The space is modern and nicely decorated. The seating is comfortable and partitions between tables allows for some intimacy when you're sharing a table; they do have tables for bigger groups like our too but most are tables of 8 split into two; four people per grill. The overall service was good, the food was streaming in at a good pace, and although some was never asked if they needed a drink refill, they were attentive when it came time to changing our grill (5 times!) that was too charred. My only drawback would be that they had run out of sake, so  most had to opt for a regular cocktail which were just okay.We chose the samurai menu, which came with edamame, miso soup, chicken karaage, tuna tataki, beef garlic noodles, salad, and rice for starters. Everything was really good except for the chicken which I found a little dry but the noodles were the bomb! Then came the raw meat, poultry and seafood : skirt steak, ribeye, short ribs, filet mignon, beef ribs, pork belly, chicken, and shrimp. We also had eggplant, broccoli, and zucchini. Time to get grilling! The food was outstanding compared to other bbq spots: great quality, generous quantity, and perfectly seasoned. You can really taste the food; no heavy marinades and spices. The waitress helped with recommended grilling times so our food was always perfectly cooked. At last came dessert, choice of ice cream or s'mores. Grilling s'mores indoors was fun and different so we really had fun with this one! I would definitely return to this spot! The food was really good, great quality and very inexpensive. Our whole menu was at 32$ each! Besides the sake situation and a little confusion with the bill, the overall service, food, and vibe of this place makes for a fun night out."

They gave us a new platter and the manager came out to apologize. I'm not an expert when it comes to korean bbq but all the meat was delicious and the marbling looked very nice. I particularly enjoyed the spicy pork and chef recommended Galbi. One of the best customer service I have ever received - the manager even came out to say goodbye and apologize again???

The Sake cocktails were great and not too sweet and not too strong. The meats were all fresh as was the seafood. The beef Bibimbap was great - crispy rice is everything :) The whole experience was really nice from the food to the location to the friendly quick service. The only thing that was lackluster was the dessert , it wasnt bad but wasnt anything special.

This menu was very good, it had a little bit of everything (assorted beef, chicken, pork, shrimps, zucchini, broccoli, eggplants, salad, rice, noodles, soup, dessert).... yeah those noodles were awesome, really. The quantities are ok, not too huge. 2 of us were big eaters so we had to order extra stuff (obviously that spicy beef and the noodles). We asked what the table next to us ordered and it was 2 meat menus for 2. I think that is a better option and next time we will go for that.So to summarize, very good quality food but small portions, nice joyful service, nice restaurant. Would come back."

/user_details?userid=m4F20BqqITkWSpxTSHfSLg,Ms. Z.,"Arlington, VA",3 star rating,"Really wanted to like this place. So many great reviews and yet it was quite disappointing. We tried 5 different cuts of meat and shrimp. Only 1 cut was really good which I think was the marinated kalbi. The shrimp was good too. There was a special melted cheese which I enjoyed dipping the broccoli into. They brought the meat cuts first and the cheese. By the time the cheese melted, we still hadn't gotten the veggies and sides. I found this quite strange that we were not informed which dishes would come first. Most meats and shrimp were brought out first. When we were done they changed the grill and finally brought the sides and veggies out. They say leave the veggies on the grill for x amount of minutes. While sitting and waiting for a while, the foil that the sides were in was still cold. Finally we flagged someone down and they said the grill was off. Common. Don't you check the grill after changing to a clean one?? By this time we had pretty lost our appetite but still hungry while waiting for another 10minutes or so. Server was barely in sight much and we felt that we had to catch someone's attention if we needed anything. Best part yet when we asked for a Shirley temple for a kid she said that it was not possible. They can't make it. What??? My friend then said it's just sprite with grenadine. The server said that they Cannot make it because there is No Button in the computer system to ring it in. Wow. Really??? Then I remembered they had a virgin Sakura drink on the menu. Basically it was sprite, grenadine and yakult. So I Then told her to put that drink order in and Modify No Yakult. Voila ! There you have it. A Shirley Temple. My friend enjoyed the ambience even with the few mishaps. I however was not impressed at all. Was waiting to go try the Arlington location but after this experience, I'm not sure if I want to anymore."

The dessert menu was kinda disappointing for some of the items are missing in their new dessert menu.It came down to 30$plus tips per person.

Funnily enough, the stand out dishes for us were the fried chicken karaage and the garlic noodles - although I also enjoyed every other item we had. I would say that the raw items that we grilled ourselves ranged from very good to good; although we all agreed that our least favorite was the filet mignon.

I've been to the other locations of this chain in the US-this location can not compare in decor, portions of the quality of food (I mean that in a negative). This place looked more like a fast food chain (like PF Chang's) but more of a reason to try it out. Location: can't get better, located corner St catherine and crescent (the so cold party street of Montreal acclaimed by tourists). It's literally located right beside the 3 brasseurs on the corner.Decor: a lot more industrial grunge look-the word that summarizes it a retired concrete jungle turned into your Japanese BBQ restaurant.Food: I was smart to go with one of the other Elites who pointed out the ""happy hour"" Mondays specials. Basically there are discounts on a selected number of items on the menu, so it was a smart choice to go a la carte vs a combo for 2. The final bill came out to 35$ each with tax with a pitcher of Sapporo for 14$, solid steal. Items that I really enjoyed: Kimchi and the beef cuts (especially the Toro beef). All cuts were really tender and we'll seasoned. There is also 3 types of The not so hot items: volcano tuna appetitzer(something wrong with warm creamy tuna on a large tater tot), classic Bibimbop-soundd like the Hansen brothers song right lol  (a Korean rice dish often found in Japan, my server smashed it before I could even appreciate the the dish :( but it lacked meat and vegetables, it was purely rice), lastly the smores were not worth 2.50$ the crackers were stale and the marshmallow never heated up!Service: Matthew (our waiter) you will make a phenomenonal computer scientist but I also think you are now my gold standard of how every student server should be. Lively, honest about which dishes you enjoyed and personable. I asked Matthew to call his manager, Jimmy, over so I could commend the management at the restaurant. He didn't even bother stopping by, odd.. Very odd indeed.Overall: not the top Gyu Kaku restaurant in my viewpoint but it is exciting to see more US businesses expand over to our turf like this one. The app is a cute addition as well, a point collection system to earn free items and gift certificates!"

The meal came with: filet mignon, calbi chuck rib, hanger steak, Bork belly, chicken thigh, garlic shrimp and assorted vegetables (among other appetizers which were pretty good) We received the filet mignion, pork belly, and hanger steak and the waitress told us that it's last call if we want more food because she had brought everything on our meal. We looked back at the menu and realized that half the things hadn't come yet and had to ASK for items that were included in our meal. The chicken came frozen (!!) and the assorted vegetables came too. The waitress said that she already brought the kalbi chuck rib but she hadn't she confused it with the hanger steak. We ordered deserts that were good. And when the bill came the waitress apologized for the service and said that the deserts were on the house. She came with 2 bills one with beer and the other with the meals both bills we had to pay for. I calculated and they were charging us twice for the alcohol because it was already included in the hand written price they had given us. ""Desserts are on the house"" Who are you kidding?

Set reservations for 630pm on a Thursday and was glad I did as a line had started to form at the front. My boyfriend and I had never tried Japanese BBQ so we had no expectations coming into this - but they were absolutely surpassed!Our server, a girl who I don't remember, was sweet and attentive even when I saw her get more & more busy throughout the night. They start out by saying they have a 2hr max seat requirement, which I understand why. We didn't mind. We ended up ordering the geisha combo and added extra veggies and an extra side of filet mignon as it was on special. We didn't order any drinks. Total came to around $85 for the 2 of us - and we were STUFFED! Definitely didn't need those extra sides, though we ate them. We started with soup, salad and tuna tartare. Then it took what seemed like a long amount of time to get the meats. 3 different types of meat (+ our extra filet mignon), plus shrimp, plus veggies (and our xtra veggies) plus bimibap. I think that was everything?! But honestly it kept coming and I was overwhelmed! AND s'mores for dessert. Phew. Sweating just thinking about it. ** tip on the grilling, ask for a new grill halfway between the meal as the food can start to stick too much. I would suggest this as a fun date night - or 1st date night. It's almost like a little adventure throughout the evening, and that was really fun for us."

The starting salad was very good and the bibimbap was exceptional (although it was brought at the very end) and made me wish I had more room.The wide variation of meat that was brought out, while it didn't seem like a ton when we ordered, turned out to be very filling and was more than enough. The filet mignon appeared to be very good quality and the hanger steak was a personal favorite, I recommend you marinade it with the sweet soy and put the meat on your rice.Service was very good and our server, Agi (sorry if I'm getting that name wrong) was very helpful in explaining everything and was very fast to help us with any requests we had.Have to take off a star because the first thing we said to us when we sat down was that they would be kicking us out in 2 hours, however we only ordered 30min later and the food took 30min before it started coming out, which is surprising since most of it is raw meat. Leaving us an hour to eat, which for a party of 7 in a Japanese BBQ is not long.

They also have a couple of preset course menus that are a pretty good deal. However, I do not recommend the tuna volcano sushi nor the Gyu-kaku salad, both of which were disappointing, the rice being too hard for the sushi, and the salad dressing watery and unflavourful. I suggest to stick to the bibimbap and grill items for a fool-proof meal and amazing. The staff is very courteous and helpful, regularly picking up the empty plates and changing the grill.

Because of it's great location on Crescent, just below Ste. Catherine, we decided to go for a drink and wait...we really wanted Japanese BBQ!

Great way for people to wait for a table.Service here is outstanding - we had Michiko who explained the menu to us and was very attentive. The food came out quite quickly despite it being a full house and was delicious. We split a BBQ menu for 2 (I think it was the premium 'combo') and added calamari on the side which was delicious. The BBQ meat & chicken was well marinated, the fried chicken was so good and even the veggies in their foil packets were good. We were so hungry and so busy cooking our food, I totally forgot to take any photos of what we ate. Our water glasses were always full and Michiko changed our BBQ grill several times so our meat wouldn't stick...she really paid attention to us.

As the restaurant is noisy and the waiters are in a hurry, it can be difficult to hear. But it's not really a problem, you can still manage by yourself. With that, you have 3 sauces available: ponzu, soya and spicy sauce.Overall the experience is great, I've been there a lot of time and I'll be back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=TDALtdzPzLw8gCMCATYpxw,Tracy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Really good! Went with a group of friends and selected the groupmenu for a party of 4 and I must say well worth the price.  The different cuts/parts of the meat were fresh and tender. The only thing I dislike was the seats are really tight especially during the winter season we have heavy coats and it takes up a lot space.

We got the Meat Lovers for 2 which was a ton of food for the price. The service was great all night from the moment we walked in.

Great food, outstanding service, very accommodating to our needs.Even though we arrived late, they made every effort to seat us quickly.There was a misunderstanding relating to the menu that was my fault. However, the manager made sure the item was taken off the bill even though they invited us to keep the food.I would highly recommend this particular location, with big kudos to the manager working that night (Mon, July 29 evening)"
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So i finally managed to make a reservation at gyu kaku and checked it out with a good friend. I thought the service was attentive, but a bit cold and dispassionate.10min after arriving, we were led to our table and informed that we should leave in 2 hours to allow others to enjoy the restaurant as well. While this may be a valid point and it is more understandable given their popularity, I would have preferred to be informed about it while i was making the reservation. Not every dinner outing lasts more than 2h, but it takes away from the experience when you have to worry about the time...What brings me to gyu kaku is that it's more interactive and fun than the usual dinner experience at a restaurant: you make ur own bbq at your own table. My friend and I got the ""meat lover's"" for 2. Given that we got raw ingredients delivered to our table, there is not much to say about the ""food"" except that the sauces were nice. Most of the meat variety they serve are quite fatty and thin. So unless you're an excellent bbq chef, you change your grate often enough and you're totally dedicated to moving and turning the pieces, I'm afraid you end up having a very unhealthy meal! I think this is a nice experience for group outing, particularly if you really like BBQing and want someone else to prepare the meat and take care of the mess at the end. If you're looking for a peaceful dinner and leisurely conversation with a close friend though, this may not be the perfect place :)"

The cuts of meat are very good quality, well prepared and seasoned to perfection. The little dipping sauces that are on the side are also really good. Service never skips a beat here - they always deliver. It's a little bit pricey but I came here on a fancy date night and it was perfect. Make sure to come early or make reservations as it gets really busy really fast!"
/user_details?userid=uyhq9vxE8fBIuVMT7AApEw,S S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In comparison to most Asian bbq places, Gyu-Kaku is a bit more upscale and this is immediately noticeable in the modern decor and top notch cleanliness. The seating arrangements are comfortable and the ventilation is very good so you won't come out smelling too much like marinated meat. While it is not all you can eat, this is more than made up for by having high quality meat (especially beef) and good customer service. The menu is extensive and also has a variety of set combos based on party size. The happy hour menu in particular (55$ for 2) is good value and can be had after 8:30pm(Tues-Thurs+Sun) or 9:30pm (Fri-Sat), after which certain menu items also enjoy reduced pricing. Reservations are a must as the restaurant is always full.House sake (hot/cold) is also extremely well priced, coming in at 10$ for a small bottle or 17$ for a large bottle, which is a great deal in this city.Over my visits, they have maintained consistent food quality and have actually improved in terms of customer service, with waiters now checking up on you more often and ensuring that the meat arrives in a timely fashion. New menu items like miso calamari and taiyaki are also being added, which shows that they are constantly striving to improve.While this is a chain, it is a great addition to the Montreal food scene, as it shows that international Asian chains have now put Montreal on their radar. We can hopefully expect that more will follow suit."

Hands down my favourite Japanese BBQ place. During lunch time, they have a super cheap combo of 2 to 3 choices of meat with rice and miso soup for around 13-17$. For supper time, if you are a group of 4-5people I definitely recommend the Samurai combo! You will get to taste a variety of food! And they are all oh so delicious!

/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"To start, just check out the way they manage broken links on their website - gyu-kaku.com/montreal-ca…OKAY, now that we're done with that, let me tell you about my delicious meal! We were seating prompty in regards to our reservation. As a group of 4 we decided to split the ""Samurai for 4"" package for $125 ($146 worth of items if ordered individually). We were served our first dishes promptly and they were good at managing when to bring out the next plates in order to have a good flow as there isn't enough room on the table to fit all of the dishes, while also making sure we always had food ready in front of us. With some items, like the broccoli, the staff dropping it off gave the 10 second instructions for heat and time that you might not have already known. All of the meats were clearly of much higher quality that you'll usually find around Montreal, and the available sauces included 3 options that covered sweet, spicy and citrus. The drinks were reasonably priced and staff were really surprising in their ability to be useful, friendly and informative without being overbearing. There was a great amount of teamwork among their staff that resulted in a very smooth service.Not so perfect moments: One of our ""appetizers"" was delivered halfway through the meal (Beef garlic noodle). It didn't make much of a difference because it was a noodle dish, but it may matter to others. The Miso really wasn't to my taste. Also, their literature continually references their ""Happy Hour"" specials despite the fact that these specials only take place outside of the traditional hours (their happy hour is before 5pm or after 8:30/9:30 depending on the day - except Monday when it's all day)I will certainly be going back, probably within 2 weeks, and suggest you download their app to take advantage of their points system (FREE FOOD!!)."

Their meat is definitely high quality and is flavored to perfection. Although the portions seem a bit small, it definitely fills you up. Their rice dishes are delicious as well. I loved absolutely everything. I would recommend this place to anyone 100%. PRICE: A tad bit more expensive but considering the quality that you get, definitely worth it.SERVICE: The service was excellent when I came.

We live nearby and decided to try it out on a Thursday night. I wanted to reserve on OpenTable but didn't see a convenient time so called them and they were happy to accommodate us at 7pm. The place itself is nicer than I expected (I was picturing an AYCE chain), with birch trees, brick walls and concrete floors. We wore random clothes because we expected to smell like bbq afterwards, but the ventilation system is actually so efficient that we didn't need to jump in the shower after dinner. You can order set meals for 2 or 4 people, or go a la carte. We ordered their 3 beef bestsellers, spicy pork, spicy kalbi ramen (can you see the pattern), Korean tofu soup, mushroom medley and Shishito peppers. The food was delicious! The beef cuts were premium and so tender. They give you dipping sauces for your meats but honestly everything was so well-marinated that you don't even need the sauces. Just be warned though- they do favour quality over quantity as the portions were relatively small. I also didn't care much for the ramen as their focus is obviously on the bbq. For dessert we had the red bean fish pancake. We grilled the "" fish "" and devoured it warm with scoops of sesame ice cream. What more can you ask for? We'll definitely be back!"

I enjoyed grilling my own meat and everything was good to be honest. I particularly enjoyed the different beef and the spicy pork. The bibimbap we excellent too! Service was quick and perfect.

The bbq built into every table have amazing exhaust fans, they literally suck the air back in, you don't leave smelling like fried onions. Portions are very decent. Their menu style is more like bundles of appetizers, main dishes & 1 dessert at different prices & types of meat included; as is your typical Japanese BBQ. The variety was great, each dish really had a unique flavour, their marinations are very interesting. Staff are extremely friendly & engaging, joyfully working. Everyone in the restaurant including the kitchen staff greets you in unison on your way out in Japanese. Would definitely go back again. Also, make sure you make a reservation, it's usually busy."

I would recommend making a reservation as the place was packed! - we got the super fan of meat group combo (made for 2 people) but twice (therefore for 4 people), and it was plenty for us! Everyone was full - meaning it is pretty generous portions. It includes several entrees (bibimpbap, chicken karaage, salads, a bunch of different delicious meats and ice cream)- the ambiance is really nice, hip yet casual. I find it sweet that all of the staff greet and thanks the customers as they come in and leave. - Our waitress, Emilie, was really sweet and professional, she refilled our tea and soft drinks as soon as they were close to low, came to see us several times to make sure we were enjoying our time, which we were! - the meat is of a good quality, not like some of the AYCE korean bbq places. I would definitely come back and recommend this place over those AYCE korean bbq places, for about the same price, you get better quality food, which is always a win!"
/user_details?userid=VVNIjjX6ZOhmfH1UWNW05A,Jessie H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My bad review is for their service and attitude because we didn't even eat there. We made a reservation for a Friday dinner. Walking there in the rain took slightly longer time and when we got there we were a few (less than 5) minutes late than the 15min window for reservations. And when we got there we were told that our reservation had been canceled. The waitress questioned us if we knew the cancellation rule for reservations. She will put us on the waitlist. I admit that I was not in a great mood after a long week and having to walk in the rain. However, I went for a dinner, not an interview. Even if I was late, shouldn't your attitude be still welcoming than blaming?Since they took our phone number when I made the reservation, I assumed that they would have called us before canceling the reservation. And their answer was that it's their policy and they don't call customers because of a large number of reservations. And the customers call them if they were late. Then why did you still ask for my phone number?? Doesn't it imply that you will contact us if there's a problem? Besides, it turned out that they actually could find another table for us. In fact, there was more than one table available and there was not a long line for tables.Even though it is a barbeque restaurant, it doesn't feel warm and welcoming at all. We had already lost our appetite when we were coldly told that our reservation had been canceled, so we left without having dinner there.  We have been to many Gyu-kaku locations in the US. They all had better (even if fake hospitality) standard service like all Japanese theme restaurants. Good luck to keeping customers with your current service quality. I doubt if I will give them a second chance."

The staff is super friendly and asked us if we wanted to change the grill a couple of times (which I find is pretty rare in BBQ places, especially the AYCE ones). My only complaint is the price, it's pretty expensive, but I think the food and service is worth it! It's definitely a place to try out.

I was disappointed how many tables are opened but didn't let ppl seat. The host said the table is reserved for 1.5hr but service was so slow 1.5hr was not enough. At the end, (bc I'm such a nice customer lol) rushed my way out so next customers can enjoy. Once arrived to the table, few items on happy hour meat combo was gone so another disappointment. We ordered few sides as extra but took forever to arrive. I have more to say but I will stop. Based on my last visit, i recommend you to go on your discretion. Waitress and waiters are super nice. I don't think it's their problem for slow service. Just the kitchen and hostess/host making things slow. But again, I am not a restaurant expert so can't pin point who other than the host at that time."

The food is as good as other locations (e.g., Cupertino and San Mateo California, Chicago, Boston, and Miami). The service is a bit slow. However, it is by far the best BBQ place in the city--definitely better than any other local restaurant! I have been to this place 3 times in the past 3 weeks and will definitely come back again! Oh and another thing I really like about this location is that the wait is not as long as US locations."

People seem happy working there, which is a big plus for the business. And as a BBQ lover, it is such a elegant place to have a feast without coming out smelling like you've been grilled too. Zero smoke high tech griller made in Japan, makes me wanna have one at home!! The meat quality is great! So are the vegetables. The noodles and other side dishes are tasty too! Great for group hangout. They open all day, so convinient especially for late lunch after a weekend shopping date."

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves meat and BBQ, the happy hour set menu could easily fill 2 person with very affordable value. Not to mention the staff was very friendly and accommodating, Mirela was very helpful in helping us order the right amount of food. I will definitely come back again when I'm feeling like BBQ."

/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The chain has finally made it to Montreal thanks to the growing Asian community. The quality of the meat cuts are undeniable, the quantity of the set menus are more than sufficient so it's really not necessary to be an all you can eat compared to the Korean BBQ next door. The Harami Skirt Steak in Miso Marinade and Certified Angus Kalbi Short Rib in Tare Sweet Soy Marinade are the staples. We also ordered some sides such as the mushrooms that was nicely perfumed, the spinach was a bit too drenched in butter. The only thing that was disappointing was the tofu stew, it was so salty we could not finish it. I do wish there was more choices like different chicken cuts etc that was very common in Japan over grill and it will be something easy to incorporate in the menu.  The quality of the meat and other sides are a great motivation to be back and furthermore if they added more things. Even though the place is big with usually large groups the ambiance is quiet and relaxing that can makes it also a great date dinner.  Reservation is needed as is it still very popular."

We were greeted with a Japanese cheer by all the staff upon entering the dining area to be seated. The food was amazing - the meat was tender and deliciously savoury. Our favourite meat was the, Harami Miso Skirt Steak along with the Chicken Karage (appetizer). The restaurant itself was clean and air conditioned. The ventilation was also pretty great, we didn't come out of the restaurant smelling like BBQ. The portion sizes were more than satisfactory, you'll be full and happy. To avoid waiting for a table, make reservations. Enjoy the wonderful food, friendly service and welcoming ambience!"
