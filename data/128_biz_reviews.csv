I am delighted that I decided to stop here instead of the hectic Second Cup. It's an oasis of healthy options, and everyone who works here is so friendly and helpful with talking through all the tasty options. While the prices are a bit higher, don't be scared off. The portions are pretty generous. I loved the Green Machine and The Warrior smoothies. The wraps are also delicious. There are plenty of wall outlets to plug in all your devices. The WiFi works great, and the atmosphere is chill. They let me keep my tab open all day while I worked. Clean restrooms, too! Playlist is chill, with some Leon Bridges and Beyoncé. My jams.Thank you for everything, Velish! I came back three times over the course of my stay because it was so convenient. I craved the refreshing smoothies during the summer heat. Wish I could take you home to NYC with me!"

Plus for the last couple of vacation trips hubs and I have taken, we've come away from the heavy breakfasts filled with toast and eggs and hash browns and this and that- for lighter options instead. So when Velish came up on my feed for Smoothies, I was already interested. It also worked out fine in terms of location because it was on our way up to the Mont Tremblant area. Just so you know, Velish is in Tau Markets (I think?). This place has a nice list of smoothies- but it's their ingredients that stand out the most. But we also wanted to start with either Wheatgrass or Watercress shots- but these guys don't have any. Our smoothies were made perfectly with my request for Almond milk. Price was good and gave us the ammunition we needed for later on."

We ordered the peanut butter and banana toast, the avocado toast, and the açaí bowls. They were all delicious, although they took a very long time to make. They ran out of ice when I was there, so I couldn't order the iced latte I wanted. But overall, great little healthy breakfast spot."
