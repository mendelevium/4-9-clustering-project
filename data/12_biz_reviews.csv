The foie gras poutine is delicious, but very rich and decadent, but a must try.The canned duck was a very unique experience where you pour the duck out of the can. The sauce was again unctuous and rich, but very fitting for the theme of the restaurant. Jarret de porc for two was the last piece, and we were really stuffed at the end. During the pandemic, we tried their take-out pizza. It was a very satisfying pizza, we tried two pizzas, the Charcuterie and the boudin. Both were heavily topped with a variety of ingredients, when paired together made the perfect bites. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=Rvn-Ymc8_9z4vbcm2ZwenQ,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"What a memorable meal! I had Au Pied de Cochon on my list the first time I came to Montreal years ago but my friend and I were unable to go. So on this trip with my husband, we made reservations for date night. The atmosphere is very relaxed and almost casual, like a neighborhood bistro. But the food was top notch! Of course we ordered foie gras to start with and it was heavenly! For our entrée we shared the canard en conserve (duck in a can). Highly intriguing, extremely satisfying. It's a bit of a puzzle how they cook this thing but it was extremely delicious and I highly recommend it. I enjoyed a natural wine from Quebec with my dinner while my husband had one of their fantastic cocktails. For dessert we had both the flan and the maple syrup tart. My gosh! Talk about indulgence! That tart was so incredible I immediately looked up a recipe so I can recreate it at home. We left incredibly full and immensely satisfied. Definitely a must visit if you're in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=Vqp0dpug9Db-kFHO3PkAaQ,Dilys C.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"This was one of the top restaurants we were looking forward to trying on our trip to Montreal in January. What we enjoyed:- foie gras nigiri - everyone thought this was a great fusion dish! Rich, buttery and melts in your mouth! One thing about this dish is the slices of foie gras are inconsistent, some smaller than the others. - blood sausage - comes with mashed potatoes and bread to spread on, great flavours and great to share. It is a little bit on the heavy side. - duck in a can - this was the star of the dish! Moist, rich and flavourful. What I can skip out on next time:- blue cheese salad - if you really like blue cheese, this is for you. However, it came out strong for us - melting pot - this dish has a good mix of everything to try, but I would choose duck in a can over this dish.Dimly lit atmosphere, a bit on the louder end but we had a great time! Excellent service as well. This place is on the pricier side, but definitely a place to try foie gras dishes."
/user_details?userid=uVhf2A-VM1OublBTmhhK0A,Tiffanie L.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",2 star rating,"Unfortunately underwhelming (February 2020)- the wait for the duck seemed rushed;20 minutes only (in comparison to other reviewers saying it took 30-1 hour) and when we ate the canned duck was chewy and not tender at all/hard to into - the sauce tasted also tasted overwhelmingly thick and burnt. The bread appetizer was delicious, and started off our night. The French onion soup was also extremely salty :/ The waitress also recommended the foie gras bites, which burst in your mouth, but also it wasn't anything special Overall- it was not really worth it in my opinion, but try it out if you'd like. Maybe I came at a wrong time, or had high expectations (my friend recommended this restaurant to me)"
/user_details?userid=SmdjvnqkvNdg8m3S_GnoDQ,Marie-Anne P.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For our first date of 2020, we finally decided to go to the Au Pied du Cochon on Duluth, and boy were we impressed! Au Pied du Cochon prides itself on sourcing quality ingredients, which they then incorporate in original and tasty dishes - you're pretty much sure to eat something you've hardly, if ever, eaten before, and that is its greatest strength. We started with some beautifully umami foie gras croquettes, tiny single bites that were unlike anything I've ever tasted (and I come from foie gras country!). My husband had a deer and pork gratin in which the scalloped potatoes had been slowly cooked, lending a rich and meaty quality to the dish. The portion was very generous and he was even struggling to finish his meal. I had an astonishingly fresh duck carpaccio with thinly sliced mushrooms, cheddar and cucumbers, a soy-infused egg yolk, and an additional dashi soup with fried tofu on the side. This made for a gorgeous Asian/Québec fusion sort of dish and definitely an experience in and of itself. We then finished our meal on the sweet note that is the ""pouding chômeur"", an ubiquitous bread and maple pudding that is quintessentially Québec.Their wine selection is decent - as always in North America, dessert wines, which are a fixture in any menu of my native France, are scarce, but it's easily forgiven. I had a lovely Riesling and my husband a red Côtes-du-Rhône. The staff was obviously bilingual, as is the norm in most of Montréal, and helpful, taking the time to explain all the dishes and what ingredients they were composed of. One last thing tho - it is a bit on the pricey side. Main dishes are $30 on average, so you'll definitely be looking at a three-digit bill. But the price is entirely justified: it is just that good!"
/user_details?userid=XwMZ4qe0Icf7csxWJ-Wm6A,Katy Q.,"Montgomery, NJ",5 star rating,"Not much to say that hasn't already been said... this place serves its niche as a sophisticated meaty restaurant very very well. So much exploratory options to choose from, but gotta use some self control. This is Important (with a capital I) since everything on the menu (as many warned) is extremely heavy and hearty. A solid set for our party of 6:- Complimentary bread (even the crust was good soft)- Tomato Tart (if pizza and quiche had a perfect baby)- Mushroom pasta (creamy with graceful bacon bits)- Duck in a can (27min of high cooking to soak in all the duck parts and veggie flavors together in one brilliant blend)- Shepherds Pie (with crazyass flavorful kick)- AND THATS IT YOU SHOULD STOP RIGHT HERE YOU CANT EAT MORE EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU CAN ITS JUST PHYSICS.Place is crowded (and temperature was set a bit too warm). And yes you need reservations. Definitely a recommended experience."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"So naturally, doing what real Yelp'ers do, I researched a few places to eat before actually visiting! This place came up on 2 different TV shows featured on The Travel Channel because of their infamous ""Duck In A Can"". More to come on that.Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right off of the vintage cobblestone roads of downtown Montreal is this gem. There's a lovely amount of outdoor seating, a bit a bar seating and a fair amount of traditional dining seating. This restaurant gives me the feel that the owner didn't know how popular this place was going to become because of its size. Reservations are highly recommended. We tried coming to this place just out the blue one day and boy were we wrong. Lol. I had to make reservations 3 weeks out because of how booked they were, but it was worth it. So we chose to sit near the back and it was quite cozy. The atmosphere was very busy with a lot of the staff running around, but very efficiently. The lights were dim and quite romantic with a wall of mirrors giving the illusion of a bigger space.Service: Tom was our actual server, but we weren't the most pleased. There was a big party of maybe 8 to 10 at the very back of the restaurant that seemed to take all of his attention. He was very ""quick"" with us to get back to his party table to where it seems he was having a lot more fun. We didn't appreciate it and we let him know, but then he tried to come out of his shell. Nah fam. Too late. Skander and Osser were other servers that delivered our food as well as refilled out waters. We REALLY liked them and wish one of them had been our server from jump because they paid us a lot more attention than Tom did.Food: So I'm here for ""Duck In A Can"" and nothing else. Lol. It's such a cool and niche dish for sure. From my travels in Montreal I've learned that duck is a BIG deal and I totally understand it. So, the duck in a can contains bacon, seared foie gras, duck breast, the fat from the duck breast and a bunch of other ingredients. It's all packed into a can then cooked in water for 28 minutes. They come to the table, open the can and do an incredible presentation. I loved it. It was incredible flavored, a good portion and totally unique. I don't think I'd ever get anything else here.Value: All priced are in $CAD. This place is NOT cheap. I picked up a bottle of red wine and one of the cheapest they had was $51.00. Yikes. It was certainly tasty though. My Duck In A Can was $44.00, but absolutely worth it. From the good service Osser and Skander gave us to the quality, to the portions as well as the overall experience, it was worth it.In conclusion, I will be making my way back here whenever I get back to Montreal. It's so worth it."
/user_details?userid=49sNJ1cHVRW4ao2tAUL9Ng,Heather O.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"As a lover of all things foie gras (and watching Anthony Bourdain sweat over the amount of food consumed), this was a must-do when visiting Montreal over the past weekend. Reservations are hard to come by on the weekend, so we managed to squeeze in a 10:00 p.m. slot. The restaurant moves as a frantic, fast-paced, yet well-oiled machine, with part of the kitchen open-concept and up front so you can catch the action. We decided to keep it simple, and we ordered the foie gras poutine, foie gras terrine with maple butter, the infamous ""duck-in-a-can,"" and the maple pudding. The restaurant also offered some specialty cocktails, so my plus one ordered a maple gin cocktail, followed by a cucumber and cilantro mojito. Drinks - I managed to steal some sips of both cocktails - refreshing, fruity, and deliciousFoie Gras Poutine - this was absurd, over-indulgent and delicious. French fries covered in gravy, squeaky cheese curds, and warm foie gras. Need I say more? Foie Gras Terrine - The terrine was smooth, rich, and paired perfectly with the sweet maple butter on toasted points. My only complaint was that there was probably not enough bread to supplement the terrine, and just as a warning, this dish is best split with 4 diners. Duck-in-a-can - It's duck breast, foie gras, seasonal vegetables all cooked in a can for 27 minutes and served tableside. The rich sauce that the dish was cooked in was flavorful. The duck breast portion was pretty large, but I felt that the meat was just a little bit too tough for my liking. Maple pudding - We were incredibly full by the time we ordered dessert, but we decided to try the maple pudding. It's a warm bread pudding, almost like a cobbler, over a sticky sweet sauce. Maybe I'm not a huge maple syrup fan, but this was way too sweet. Overall, this was a delight to experience and worth the visit."

For starters, we got their blue cheese salad thinking it would be a nice light way to prepare us for our meal. It was the richest thing we ate that night, and it was absolutely incredible. All the sausages were delicious, and the service was wonderful."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"APC is very much one of my favourite culinary experiences this year in 2019 in Montreal. I've been to the APC sugar shack which I believe tries to replicate the vibe and feel of this quaint, small special restaurant (but in a sugar shack kind of way). However APC is unique. The restaurant is small, packed to the gills and they excel in service, presentation and candor out high quality super rich food in a dizzying delivery. I say this as there must be 30+ people working in this tiny restaurant. To watch the service is akin to shaking up a beehive and watching the bees go in and out in cacophonous harmony. The food I sampled on the evening was the following:1) bleu salad- with fennel, crushed walnuts (I believe) in a creamy sauce. One of the most flavour filled amazing salads I've had in a while. Complex, blue cheese creamy and filling.2) poutine- unbelievable. Two or three kinds of rich creme and gravy sauce over crispy potatoes with chunks of foie gras. If I ever had a last meal on earth this could be a finalist request for that. 3) PDC farci foie gras- a bottom leg (pork trotter I believe) stuffed topped with foie gras. This was not enjoyed at all. Sure the stuffing was good but the meat was minimal and it was filled with fat, skin, collagen and other non pleasing fatty substances. I eat innards and organ meat but this was a miss ordered item on our part. Overall would I return on despite of not liking #3? Of course as everything else we observed  come out of the kitchen looked creative, rich and decadent. Definitely a pleasure to experience and enjoy to the fullest. It's a rich dinner. Possibly your fat and cholesterol limits for a full year but this is the reason people come and seek out these decadent delights."

The ambiance was inviting and vaguely reminiscent of Europe - the street in which the restaurant was situated had cobblestones and it wasn't too crowded. Everything from the service to the FOOD was perfect! We were very well taken care of. The foie gras poutine was the best poutine that I've had. There. I've said it. I thought the best poutine that I've had was at La Banquise...but I was wrong. The foie gras poutine at Au Pied De Cochon is the best!! The poutine itself looked like it could be too rich but it wasn't. The fries, cheese curds, gravy and foie gras were in the perfect harmony with one another. The Duck In A Can was quite a demonstration. The duck was poured directly from the can (which was opened right in front of us and kudos to the one of the servers for not touching the contents in the can) onto the plate. Then it was time to dig in. And wow - the duck was succulent and was unlike anything that I've tasted before. It was the perfect main after the foie gras poutine too! Since we came in on my boyfriend's birthday, the staff were kind enough to get us complimentary maple crème brûlée (with sparklers!) and some champagne to celebrate. They have definitely gone above and beyond when it came to service. Definitely give Au Pied De Cochon a visit if you can. You will not be disappointed!"

Some highlights to recommend: 1) Foie gras nigiri - melt in your mouth texture accented by ponzu sauce.  2) Foie gras pountine - great for sharing.  Otherwise would be bit heavy. 3) Plogue a champlain - pancake, potato, cheese, fried egg, bacon and foie gras in maple syrup reduction.  It's like tasting an elaborate breakfast sandwich with foie gras.  Last thought, Duck in a Can dish takes long time to cook so be prepared to wait.  Also, would suggest to reduce the salt level for this dish.Overall, heavy dishes with large portions great for sharing."
/user_details?userid=A1WH7p28np55o_6xAKZxQA,Alan C.,"Cupertino, CA",5 star rating,"Superb service, exemplary staff, and wonderful dishes. First time coming here and we sought out recommendations from the staff. They recommended the plogue a Champlain, a buckwheat pancake bottom topped with cheese, bacon, foie bras, and topped with maple syrup. This was easily my favorite dish to start with as the combination of flavors complemented each other well. Next up as our main, we shared the melting pot, essentially a mish mash of all things pork related (pork sausage, blood sausage, pork belly, pork loin, onions, and various other veggies with a bottom layer of mashed potatoes and cheese. My taste buds were exploding with flavor, it was so delicious! We finished with the maple pudding chomeur which I can only describe as their version of bread pudding slathered in Carmel sauce. It was a bit too decadent for our taste, so we left a lot of the Carmel sauce but devoured the bread part!During our entire meal, our glasses were constantly topped off and we were never left unattended so I must say, service was superb. Our reservation was at 10 pm but they were still taking orders around 11pm! Would definitely recommend anyone to come here if they have time."

I heard of this place after watching Anthony Bourdaine come here.   They serve fresh warm bread at the beginning, which is always perfect. I ordered the Plogue a Champlain and I promise you it is the best thing you will ever taste. Everything on the menu is fantastic and a little fois gras on top never hurt anyone ;) My arteries feel like they're going to clog after I eat here, but damn it tastes so good! I strongly recommend making a reservation a few days in advance as it is pretty hard to just walk in without waiting a while. If you are in Montreal, you MUST try this place, no exceptions!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Rarely does a resto live up to its hype as well as Au Pied de Cochon did. It's an unassuming little place on Duluth, easy to miss walking or driving past it which can lead to you miss quite a dining experience! Don't bother just walking in, it's quite unlikely you'll find a seat so book online weeks/months ahead. It's effortless.We opted to sit at the bar and got a first row view of the kitchen team work in an ""organized chaos"" during the entire dining experience. I sat there transfixed for 2 hours as they worked non-stop serving great looking dishes one after another.For starters I went with an Amaretto Sour and it was absolutely on-point. Delish! For apps we went with the Fois Gras Poutine and Blue Cheese salad. I won't go into details on the salad as it wasn't intended for me (not a huge fan of Blue cheese) but the couple of bites I took were quite decent. The poutine on the other hand was downright shockingly good! Doesn't look great visually and the actual expiration of the plate is less than 5 minutes but the richness of the gravy and fois gras truly deserves it's legendary Montreal status. Absolutely divine!!!! On a scale to 5, I'll say it's one of the few plates I've ever eaten that breaks the scale and is a 6. SIMPLY. AMAZING.They serve the best warm bread too - soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, butter easy to spread. ME LIKEY.As a main we went with the stuffed PDC with fois gras and it was underwhelming. It was quite fatty and frankly it was mostly fat and stuffing. Wouldn't have it again and I guess that decision is on us. When I'll come back (and I will), I'll definitely try one of the many other things on the menu they have. For dessert, I saved a little space for a little poor man's pudding with maple syrup. Served in an unassuming small bowl it doesn't look too aesthetically pleasing but the warm pudding suddenly made me realize I wasn't full just yet.... GODSMACKINGLY GOOD.What a food coma I had later. ZZzzzzzz!!! Price-tag is $$$$, expect to pay around $100 if you go for a few drinks, an app, a main and a dessert but it's entirely worth treating yourself to the PDC experience."

Everything is a tad rich though so you may end up feeling full/heavy despite not having a crazy amount of food. The duck in a can was sinful. The duck inside comes with a hunk of fat, and it's soo delicious. Also enjoyed the foie gras nigiri and poutine. The desserts was a tad too sweet -- but for someone who loves their sweets, it may not be a problem. Mainly talking about their chomeur pudding!"

We got the Cheung Fan Foie Gras, the Tripes and Tomatoes, and the Pork Chop! Pork chop was deliciousssss - moist and cooked just right. The tripes were ok - as an Asian-American they tasted a little weird since I'm used to having it in my pho. I also think they may have been cooked a bit funky because I had stomach issues right after eating it and then my husband finished the left overs a day later and had the same issues. Would highly recommend the foie gras though!Wine selection was amazing! Definitely would try other food options next time we are he"

There were only early dinner or late dinner times available, so we chose a 5:30pm slot.We were able to sit at the counter and watch the chefs in the open kitchen prepare the food.I only really came for the duck in a can, but the bf also wanted the sea whelks appetizer. Let me tell you. This food is BUTTERY, SAVORY, AND RICH. All good things of course. But prepare your stomachThey start you off with this delicious warm crispy bread. I could eat that every day- Sea whelks: a lot for what you pay for! Similar to escargot. They were bathed in butter and garlic yummm.  A little overcooked though- Duck in a can: plz get this if you come here. Seriously one of a kind dish!! but way too rich to share between only two people. We finished it, but felt a little gross after. They make the can in house, and it's filled with duck meat/fat, foie gras, onions and I'm not quite sure what else.. but they basically all bathe and cook together so the flavors combine and come out perfectly. The can is opened table-side and contents dumped onto a plate of toasted bread. I'm glad we were able to try something like this, but I think once is enough for me!"
/user_details?userid=ko4Ptc0Mc1xEQgS1NHs_ew,Winnie L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We finally had the chance to try this restaurant. We were a group of 9 and were here to celebrate various birthdays in the group. What an amazing dinner!  Everything was soooooo good and so fresh. Our server was excellent and very friendly and helpful.  As we were a large party, we had a reservation. It is a very busy place so it is recommended that a reservation be made. We also got a picture with the owner Martin Picard!This restaurant is known for its duck, pork and foie gras dishes. We decided to order a number of dishes and shared between the group. We ordered the Plogue a Champlain and it was sooo good that we ordered another one. This dish was a combination of sliced potatoes with bacon and a large piece of foie gras in a maple sauce. We also had the Cheong Fun filled with foie gras. The Cheong Fun texture was so thin and not sticky and was better than some Chinese restaurants and the foie gras just melted in your mouth.  The foie gras poutine has large pieces of foie gras and was very decadent. The foie gras nigiri was amazing and was my favourite dish. The soy sauce vinaigrette was the perfect match with the rice and foie gras. This totally melted in your mouth. This was so good that we ordered another one. We also had the picked pork tongue which was very good as well. For the main course, we ordered the Duck in a Can and the Stuffed PDC and Foie Gras. The Duck in. Can literally comes in a can which the server opens at the table into a bowl and has duck and foie gras. The Stuffed PDC is a deboned pork hock stuffed with meats with a large piece of foie gras on top with braised vegetables. These dishes were all excellent. We ended the dinner with a sugar pie, pecan pie and maple pudding chomeur (bread pudding). The desserts were really good and very sweet, especially the maple pudding. My favourite was the sugar pie. It was an awesome dinner and so glad that I had the chance to try it. Definitely worth a try if you like foie gras. I will definitely come back."

The charred bread & fresh butter was tastySkip:- Duck Carpaccio - This one was a Japanese shabu shabu style duck carpaccio with a Yeti thermal of dashi broth. The shaved duck was ice frozen and just a little weird. Although it tasted alright, it was not my favorite- Fries - they were a tad burnt. Perhaps if it was covered in gravy? No one would notice.4-4.5ish stars, but rounded up because it was easily the most memorable meal of our Montreal trip**It's a bit difficult to get a hold of them through the phone, so I emailed the restaurant directly for reservations and got a response."
/user_details?userid=311oyT5yvLunoBcvUMbitg,Sarah C.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I've always praised the food culture in Montreal - its one of the best place to go if you're a foodie. Of course, I've heard all about the reputation of Au pied de cochon - It's an establishment in Montreal. So when my meat-lover boyfriend came visit, we simply had to go.Everything from the service to the food was perfect. We had a reservation at 11:30 on a Saturday night, and even if the restaurant was packed (as usual), the staff was very attentive. We joked about how we couldn't tell who was our main server since the whole staff was taking care of us! The vibe is friendly and unpretentious, and you get such a great dining experience. One thing you should try at APC is foie gras - its on everything on their menu anyway! We shared the foie gras Poutine to have the whole French Canadian food experience. My boyfriend still dream about it! The foie gras just melts in your mouth and is so rich in flavour - trust me, it's definitely a must try! The cook even came to our table to serve the dish himself and explained how he made it. Like, wow. Such an experience. We then shared the squid ink risotto - my personal fav. Since the whole dish is black, you can't really tell what you're having until you taste it. But the freshness of the squid, mussels and scallops gives so much flavour to the dish, it's one of the best thing I've had in my life.If you're ever in Montreal or just want to have a dining experience you'll never forget - Au Pied de Cochon is definitely the place to go."

Probably not, but if I could eat everything on the menu here, I definitely would. Their menu changes quite frequently, but they have fan favourites here on a steady basis (for the record, I've eaten here twice, once 11 years ago, and most recently, today lol): the foie gras poutine, plogue a champlain, PDC stuffed with foie, and duck in a can. I don't remember what I ate 11 years ago, but I do remember missing out on the duck in a can and I came back for it today.Five stars all around. Don't take any vegetarian or vegan friends here because it's not that kind of a restaurant (seriously, the name is literally ""foot of the pig"" so...) Meat heavy, very Canadian and Quebecois, and unapologetically rich-- this place is best shared amongst friends who will appreciate all the FOOD! (Seriously, there is an entire section dedicated just to foie gras.) This time around, my partner and I dined on (together and separately):- Plogue a champlain- Foie gras nigiri- Duck in a can- Veal Blanquette- Maple creme brulee- Maple pudding chomeurThe foie gras nigiri sounds blasphemous, but it is well-balanced. Foie gras on top of rice with a peanut sauce, and you are able to add small drops of ponzu along with it. I recommend it with the ponzu, as it adds a little salt and acidity along with the fat from the foie and the sweetness of the peanut sauce. This was recommended by the waiter, and I would definitely get it again. The plogue a champlain was the star, though. You'll read about it, but just get it. Trust me. Sweet and savory and RICH. Yum. I have been waiting 11 years to come back for the duck in a can and I wasn't disappointed. It is 1/2 a duck with foie gras, mixed with veggies and some bacon I think, cooked in a can-- similar to cooking it sous vide, for precisely 27 minutes. They open the can right in front of you and dump it on a plate. It is delicious and by far shareable. You should share it, seriously. I ate it by myself and honestly, it made me full af. My boyfriend's main was the veal blanquette and it was classically prepared-- he enjoyed it very much, but was full! While you're not coming here for the desserts, they do have a variety and the pudding chomeur was excellent. I would recommend it. It is sort of like bread pudding (with the maple cream syrup) meets shortcake. I would highly recommend it.I will be coming back to Montreal and definitely stopping at APC."

I don't follow the ""food scene,"" but I felt as though we were suddenly at ""where it all happens."" We were seated and attended by a small army of waiters, servers, busboys. Everyone was constantly in a rush, but never hurrying. The kitchen was open-concept, meaning you could see the masters at work- mixing this and flipping that with absolute ease and style. The brass of the happy diners, the servers' woodwinds, the percussion of the kitchen, combined with the strings of my beautiful date completed a perfect evening with the orchestra. Which brings me to the food- the sweetest symphony you've ever heard. Beethoven's 9th.The complimentary bread was good, but we knew to stay away. We ordered the Foie Gras Poutine and Squid Ink Seafood Risotto. The poutine came first, and it was unlike anything I've tasted before. I love poutine, and this was among the best poutine I've ever tasted. The addition of foie gras (which pops in your mouth) shoots it into the mesosphere, and I was holding on for dear life. While my date apparently didn't like foie gras, even she couldn't help herself. 10/10.She had wine and I had beer. Complimented all the food very well.The seafood risotto came next. Creamy, rich, fresh, flavorful. Salty, but not too salty (disclaimer: I have a salt tooth). The ink turned our plate into an abyss. Our fork could not discriminate and so we had to rely on our senses to differentiate the different types of seafood: scallops, squid,  mussels. We couldn't finish the plate because we were so full, and when we reheated the risotto in the microwave the next day, it tasted even better. 11/10We absolutely regret eating before this meal. This food will ruin you for weeks; we still think about it two months later. The experience was invigorating."

I can usually eat a lot of food but the sheer richness of each plate left me almost nauseous (in the best of ways)I had the French onion soup which was perfection. They also had some excellent bread, which I wiped up with the soup of course. We had foie gras poutine and the melting pot. The melting pot was a bowl of mashed potatoes with all kinds of beef on top: sausage, blood sausage, pork, beef, stuff I couldn't even identify. It was super filling and I felt like I had to crawl out.Another table had huge beef or pork piece brought out on a cart and cut tableside with special maple sauce. Looked amazing!I did not have desert but many passed our table and it looked just as good. Milkshake XXX would've been my pick.Service was so friendly and fast. Beautiful place. Prices are a bit steep, but, the quality is amazing. Fully recommend."

We made a reservation for a Saturday evening (recommended!) and the place was packed. The biggest mistake we made was ordering way too many foie gras-packed items on the menu - everything was very rich and heavy and we were stuffed after just a few dishes! I would highly recommend the foie gras nigiri and the duck in the can for two, and maybe the croquettes as well. The chicken liver pate was delicious but just way too much. And I would have skipped the cheong fun altogether."

This place definitely has a wonderful vibe. Despite coming in on a Thursday night at 10:30 pm this place was buzzing. Great energy from the staff and fellow diners. The server was great and pretty much explained most of the dishes to us as it was our first time. We ended up getting the tartare temaki, the garlic foie gras, ploque au Champlain, and the pork chop.Tartare temaki - unique presentation, topped with a quail egg, order comes with 2 cones, amazing flavour, and a great starter, light in comparison to all the other dishesGarlic foie gras - roasted garlic, garlic croutons, garlic veloute, and of course the foie was melt-in your mouth amazingPloque au Champlain - my boyfriend loved this. He really enjoyed the sweetness of the maple syrup and the potatoes. Of course, topped with a heap of foie gras.Pork Chop - BEST chop I've ever had. It was cooked to absolute perfection. The portions were huge and great for sharing. But honestly, what made this dish special were the amazing button mushrooms. Not sure how it was prepared, but they were unbelievable.Prepare to nap hard after a meal here. It's heavy, creamy, fatty, and absolutely incredible. A must-do if you're ever in Montreal!"

Reservations at prime time{6:30 to 8:30} are usually booked months in advance, get a 5:30pm res to maximize your chances of scoring a table and ask for a seat near the bar.... the energy is amazing!Take your time: Tables turn typically every 2 to 3 hours, so relax....get a good bottle, look around, make friends, savor your bread and butters, chat up the staff, ask questions....APDC is one of the happiest, friendliest and most accommodating Montreal restaurants around. Go for the specials. The standard menu is pared down to the bare essentials and long time favorites {Duck in a can and the Pied de Cochon is still on there even if my favorite melting pot is now history} The specials are very seasonal and a great value especially with all the Sugar Shack themed dishes {try the APDC ham from the shack with the fried pancakes with the APDC maple syrup.....It isn't prosciutto Folks but it's Picard's best and that's just as good if not better}.Please have the Onion Soup....It's life changing!APDC does not offer classic Francophile service. The tables have no white tablecloths and service is casual, friendly and efficientThis is a unapologetically loud, boisterous and frantic restaurant so get into the scene and eat with your fingers, drink and eat too much, laugh out aloud and feed your dinner companion...It's all good and part of the timeless charm of APDC.Au Pied De Cochon has become our benchmark when it comes to Quebecois cuisine and hospitality and in all the years we've dined there have yet to disappoint. I have always left APDC well fed with a great love for Montreal and it's people, culinary culture, love of life and just a bit tipsy.Go......You'll see what I mean."

There were 4-5 empty and clean tables around-sat at our table and waited 10 mins for our server-drinks came one at a time. We ordered tea, teabag delivered, hot water took another 10 mins-appetizer, foie Gras Nigiri arrived. Wasn't informed there would be peanuts on it. -entree arrived. Mine was sitting on the counter for quite sometime. The sauce had already thickened on top. -we ordered a side of vegetables and it didn't come. Halfway through our entree, we tried to cancel the vegetables and our server said, it's coming in one minute. It took another 10 minutes. -Side order of vegetables was my favorite dish! I really really wanted to like this place, but everything went south. I travel to Montreal a lot for fun and the food and I was disappointed."
/user_details?userid=tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,Joy B.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Anthony Bourdain visited Au Pied de Cochon in 2006 to shoot an episode of No Reservations. For this show the famed Chef Martin Picard told his cooks to ""keep feeding him, and stop when he dies."" I watched that episode and knew I had to visit this place some day.Au Pied de Cochon is Chef Picard's ode to gluttony, excess, and all things duck, pig, and cow. A richer more decadent meal cannot be found, an ironic fact in a city that regularly feasts on giant plates of poutine.You need to show up famished to the point of predatory, as the portions are not only large but the food is fortifying. Rare is the dish that doesn't include if not center around foie gras. You'll notice upon arriving that the decor is classic and charming, unassuming in its simplicity. It's a long, narrow space with lots of wood paneling and homey accents, including artwork from the staff. There's a mirror on one wall which makes the space look bigger and is also used for writing that day's food specials.A must here is the legendary Duck in a Can. It begins with a plate of toast and celery root puree accompanied by a branded Canard en Conserve can that has been sealed and boiled for exactly 27 minutes. Said can is opened at your table revealing a delectable combination of medium-rare duck breast, foie gras, carrots, braised cabbage, roasted garlic, sprigs of thyme, and balsamic demi-glace. In many dishes the vegetables would play second fiddle to the hearty protein and fatty goodness, but here they are essential toward creating a concoction that's tangy, rich, and sweet all at once. I prepared for this greatness with a small appetizer consisting of tuna belly and--wait for it--foie gras. The appetizer arrived on two mini-tree trunks held together by seaweed and skewers, with the intention being to wrap each piece individually and eat it like temaki. For dessert I went the non-foie gras route with a classic creme brûlée. I'm fairly certain that this was the 'healthiest' part of the meal, but by this point, who gives a f*ck.The service in Montreal's restaurants, including Au Pied de Cochon, is a marvel to behold. Watching our servers was like witnessing a graceful pas de deux. One person is responsible for your order and handles check-ins and questions while the other does the meal service and replenishes drinks and bread. Everything is timed perfectly among the two of them and the kitchen so you're never pressured to start or end a course before you're ready. Chef Picard himself was running around plating and serving dishes in between knocking back drinks, as one does.If you feel like you're going to die after eating here, that's all part of the intended experience. I would urge any visitor to the city to try Au Pied de Cochon at least once in their life, or many times if you're lucky."

This place definitely lives up to the hype and my only regret is not having a big enough stomach to eat everything on the menu.My boyfriend and I got the duck temaki appetizer, duck in can, and crime brûlée. The temaki appetizer was so delicious! Duck tartar should definitely be more common in sushi. Great flavors and sauces mixed in with it.Let's talk about the main event though....DUCK IN A CAN. You would not believe the amount of flavor and quality they pack into this can. It's duck breast, foie gras, bacon, cabbage, and carrots. This is one of the most decadent meals I've ever had, but every bite was just pure bliss. The duck is perfectly cooked, the fat from the foie gras add great flavor, and balsamic mixes so well with every ingredient.The creme brûlée did not disappoint.

The first visit (Summer 2018) was memorable and the best Quebec food I have had. Even though there was a glitch and they didn't have my reservation on their books they seated me at the bar which was good enough. The atmosphere was jovial , couples and large families all happily enjoying the great food. The server had a lot of personality in the sense he declined to order everything I wanted to order as that would have been too much food. He also suggested the best options as this was my first visit. Also brought in an appetizer that was not on the menu. After that visit this had become my favorite restaurant.Next visit : Summer 2019. The atmosphere had changed. The restaurant looked empty and felt low energy. Just a few couples dragging on with their dates. The food was nothing to sing about. Me and my family were surprised that the quality of food was so average and below par for it's name."

It is a perfect example of how wonderful Montreal is - the service is stellar and friendly, the food is great, and the vibe is the most chill.I had to get the foie gras poutine. Warning: this is one heavy freaking plate. So rich and decadent, this plate is loaded with cheese curds, hot gravy, perfectly browned french fries, and big fat pieces of foie gras. For less than $30, it's well worth the price. I paired with a nice glass of Riesling but they have a fully stocked bar and can make you just about anything.

We ordered the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. While we waited for our dishes to arrive, the server brought us a plate of warm bread with butter. I really love restaurants that do this since I'm not a fan of waiting for dishes to arrive. I very much enjoyed the complimentary appetizer. Our poutine was served first. It was essentially the classic plate of poutine topped with slabs of foie gras. This was honestly the BEST poutine I have ever eaten. It was so rich and the gravy was very smooth. The foie gras was very rich and creamy. I had to stop myself from licking the plate as we were in a public dining area. Afterwards, we were brought the ""Duck in a Can."" The server opened the can at our table which in itself was a nice little show as he carefully constructed the dish using the contents in the can. The dish had what seemed like stewed vegetables, roasted garlic, duck, foie gras, and bread. It was such a beautifully presented dish that also brought a huge pack of flavour. I absolutely loved the richness of the dish. Coming here was such a special treat! I thoroughly enjoyed the food and service of the restaurant."

There's nowhere like PDC in the world and it is truly a taste of Quebec's finest cuisine terroir. Unpretentious atmosphere and always superb service accompanies dishes that are all to die for. From the foie-gras cromesquis, duck in a can, foie-gras and boudin tarte, bison ribs to their rotating selection of super original and delicious appetizers, you can't go wrong. Do yourself a favour and go...NOW! Actually you can't. You'll need to reserve a couple of weeks in advance to get a table.Update: hadn't been for over a year and was craving some PDC goodness. Went last night and I have to say, and I didn't think it was possible, but my meal was thoroughly disappointing. Everything was  lacklustre including the service. Every dish we had was not  even close to as good as all of my experiences in the past. I left feeling rather dissatisfied.

I remember first watching Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations years ago and saw all the rich and interesting food they offer. Now years later I've dined here several times and have many delicious meals offered up by these talented chefs. Anyone going here knows that they are big on the foie gras. So much that there is a separate section in the menu for foie gras entrees. I usually start my meal with the foie gras cromesquis. These a little bites of rich liquid where the foie gras are cut into cubes and then quickly fried. My husband who is usually a picky eater even liked it. Of course the restaurant is known for the PDC cut and the famous duck in a can meals. The PDC cut is a huge cut of the shoulder that is cooked with mushrooms and cabbage in a savory sauce. This is easily shared between two people. The duck in the can is one of my favorites. Not just because of the cool theatrics and presentation of the duck and foie gras being opened from the can and poured on the mash and veggies, but the richness of the flavors.The staff is always very friendly here and happy to make suggestions or answer any questions. If you decide to make this place a dining destination, it's best to make reservations because they are quite busy and it's rare to be able just to get a table walking in. It has been easier now to make a reservation since they now have an online system to place one. This is super helpful living outside of Canada. Can't wait to return again."
/user_details?userid=7J6sOvhSksLtzO9hFPEnGQ,Phil C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I generally do not expect places like this to live up to the hype, but this one did. We started with the foie gras terrine as a starter and was the best terrine I've ever eaten. The terrine was smooth, with the right temperature and consistency. There was a strong savory foie gras flavor to it and the presentation was smart. There was a thick sweet sauce that accompanied it, which I can best describe it as a maple-flavored dulce de leche, was smooth and rich. The duck breast with mushrooms and potatoes was excellent, as the duck as cooked nicely. The fat was generally rendered off so it wasn't too greasy, and the mushrooms added more savory flavor.The infamous duck-in-a-can was surprisingly good, as the flavors melded together without much trouble. The combination of juicy duck breast and foie gras made for an indulgent combination. I thought the duck would be overcooked but it was pink in the middle. The cabbage and bacon was okay too, but mostly filler.Service was patient and warm, despite the fact that my French is quite rudimentary. They actually complimented it, to which I was shocked.

This was our third time here and it was our best experience yet. Although we had a reservation they didn't have a table free but they were working hard to get us one. We were seated about 30 minutes later on the terrace.  We were not upset at all about the delay but they insisted on making up for it by bringing us a complimentary bottle of beer as an appératif, fried zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta and fried foie gras cubes! Absolutely unnecessary but they insisted. We ordered so many incredible dishes to share and had such a good time. We were 5 people and they suggested that 3 appetizers, 3 mains and 3 desserts would be sufficient. We appreciated their honesty because we were going to order much more. Appetizers: The homemade burratta dish was my favourite  but the tomato tart and plogue Champlain (seared foie gras with melted cheese and a maple syrup sauce) were also excellent. Mains: the tarte boudin was very unique and the trout was really delicious. It was served with a Boston lettuce salad and the two together were delicious.Desserts: there were too many great choices but we went with pouding chômeur, the begnets and homemade ice cream. Their ice cream is just exceptionable! It is a soft serve and its the perfect end to a rich meal. If it wasn't unreasonable, I would have ordered 3 ice creams!We love PDC, if you are passing through Montreal this is the place you need to eat at!"

But the morning of Anthony Bourdain passing, reading the news got me thinking it'd be nice to pay homage so I made a reservation.I love the unpretentious way of this place. It was very easy-going. The staff is friendly & helpful. The menu is foie gras dominant. We took a Plogue de Champlain, a Tarte de Boudin & Foie Gras, butter & herbs snails and a roasted veggies dish (yes, to balance it out, it was necessary) Everything was delicious. I don't really know what else to say because I cannot defend the fat side of things and I expected it. Sometimes u just gotta sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Like Anthony Bourdain said: ""Your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride""I can't say that I would come back here again volunterily, for the sake of my artery.

/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"Au Pied de Cochon (the pigs feet) is one of Montreal's signature eating establishments alongside Joe Beef.  With a heavy emphasis on meat products, especially foie gras, it's popular with locals and tourists alike.  Reservations are recommended, which we did, but they were extremely accommodating when we stopped by very early and decided to change our original much later reservation. Walking by the street, I almost missed the restaurant as there's only a menu posted outside and not much signage, but go where everyone is dining and you'll be at the right shop.  The interior is modern and clean with friendly wait staff and a nice bar area with seating as well. The ambiance is noisy with conversations while quick food service keeps the mood fun and enjoyable.  The menu is straightforward with appetizers, main entrees, and dessert listed on a single page with an entire section devoted to foie Gras.  Everything sounds delicious and the waiter was happy to explain anything we didn't know as well as the handful of daily specials.  Our order:Maple Foie Gras Comesquis - $8.  What a great start with these bite sized appetizers of deep fried dough around molten foie Gras. Served quite hot, you simply pop them into your mouth and enjoy the explosion of richness and flavor.  Mmmmm.Onion Soup - $15.  I'd been craving a excellent rendition of this French classic and Au Pied delivered.  It's covered with melted cheese but has plentiful rich and savory broth that includes onions but also another unique spin with delicious pieces of aged ham that add both flavor and meatiness to this great soup.  So good and perfect for sharing.  Carpaccio - $16.  You see this dish at many places but the uniqueness here is that the meat of choice is duck meat.  Rare pieces of thinly sliced duck meat are served on a generous platter with thin slices of cheese and a single perfectly poached egg yolk that you break and spread over the carpaccio.  Delicious and a nice contrast to the richer items on the menu. Tartare Tataki - $15. I almost didn't order this but am so glad I did.  It's literally a hand roll served with their choice of Tartare and a quail egg that you pour on top.  Our evening it was horse Tartare and you're either in or out when it comes to horse meat (and most Montreal residents are in) and after my delicious horse entree at Joe Beef, I was in.  It was delicious with a beefy Tartare that is as good as any hand roll I've had.  Delicious. Plogue a Champlain - $31.  Alongside the foie Gras Poutine, this is one of Au Pied de Cochon's signature foie gras dishes.  Since I was all ""poutines out"", this dish was a perfect choice for us.  It's a pancake, covered in pig lard, and topped with a huge piece of cooked foie Gras and maple syrup.  The French description admittedly sounds more appetizing than the description but it's a delicious mix of savory and sweet with rich and starchy.  After a few bites, I quickly began to feel satiated. Duck In a Can - $44. After so many delicious starters, ordering an entree clearly put us over the top but how could we come without ordering this signature dish.  The dish is exactly as described.  A duck leg combined with foie gras, bacon, cabbage and spices is literally canned and heated in the can to be dumped on top of a plate of puréed butternut squash and two baguette slices.  The amazing thing is that you'd expect something to be either overcooked or undercooked but everything, and I mean everything, comes out perfectly.  The duck was medium rare and well flavored.  The foie Gras was cooked and soft as nicely as the other Plogue dish.  The cabbage and bacon were hearty and mixed well with all the juices from both.  This dish is great for sharing and even-so is pure gluttony.  Very unique, very good and very memorable. Overall, I'm so happy to have stopped by Au Pied De Cochon.  I left ecstatic and satiated on the buzz of the great cocktails but also the richness of the food.  All the dishes were so unique yet consistent and well done.  I'm not sure I'll eat foie Gras again this year but I'm happy to have spent my yearly (lifetime?) quota here.  Thank you Au Pied de Cochon, especially for accommodating our earlier dinner time.  I slept very well. Au Pied de Cochon accepts credit cards including Amex."

The service or reservation system seems like it could be improved as there were plenty of people waiting for this seating and no one visibly worried that there was a long line of people at this hour, but the service was overall okay once we were seated.For our meal, we had the beef tongue, poutine, and duck in a can, all of which were quite tasty. The foie gras goes surprisingly well in the poutine, which is a heavier dish already, and the duck was very well prepared and is sauced deliciously. It's definitely worth checking out if in the area."

We went with a party of four and was seated promptly with our reservation. The staff was very accommodating of the fact that a couple of us came later than the others. The food was absolutely excellent. We started with the salmon temaki and the duck temaki which were excellent, followed by two other appetizers. We then shared the meat pie and the duck in a can as well. This was an abundance of food for four; the food as others mention is extremely rich and heavy but still very delicious and flavorful. The stand out dish of the night was the duck in a can; it simply is a must try and a staple dish of the restaurant. It's a bit strange watching the waiter open the can with a can opener in front of us and empty its contents onto the plate, but the end result is excellent. The mixture of flavors is an exquisite balance of sweet and savory combined with the duck cooked to perfection.  Definitely recommend this restaurant highly for those interested in a fine taste of québécois food!"

I struggle with this 4 star rating because the food was very delicious but the service was not. We waited long to get seated (with a reservation), we waited almost 20 min to have a waiter come to us, we waited long for just about everything. The only thing that was prompt  and attentive was the refilling of our waters.BUT and it's a big BUT, the food was very good. And at the end of the day you come to a restaurant to eat! So... we got the Poutine and some Foie Gras dish I forgot the name of. Both very good and rich as you would imagine. I got the Duck in a Can for the entree which was a very impressive signature dish. They crack the can open and pour out the unctuous contents inside revealing a perfectly cooked duck breast and foie gras, braised with other ingredients like carrots. Since it's not pan-seared like most duck dishes I've eaten there was a massive layer of duck fat that I couldn't eat, which felt wasteful cause duck fat is liquid gold! My friends got The Melting Pot which was a dish of a variety of sausages and meats atop a bed of velvety mashed potatoes. I tried the blood sausage from it and it was melt-in-your mouth good. Everything was super rich but that's just the nature of the cuisine. So don't expect some ""balanced"" dish with a side salad to offset the richness. You come here to fill yourself with stick-to-your-rib Québécois food and feel warm inside. They know what food they want to serve and they do it very well."

It came with a quail egg so that you could poor the yolk into the handroll. Completely to die for.

The waiter told me it would be more than enough food because their appetizers run on the larger side.  Then, the guy sitting next to me orders the poutine and it smells un-freaking-believable. I lean over.  ""Hey, bud, how is it?""The guy looks at me and says,""It's the best poutine I've ever had. ""Sold. I flag a server down and put in my order.  YOLO, right? Meanwhile,  my food starts trickling in. The duck carpaccio is what dreams are made of.  I cant sing enough praises over how mouth- wateringly delicious each slice of duck heaven was. The tartare temaki was not really what I was expecting; it's a sushi cone with tartare in the middle. Very filling due to the rice,  but so good.  The little quail egg yolk was a nice touch.  At this point, I'm thinking to myself,""Oh crap, I'm going to be too full for that poutine."" The guy next to me is complaining about how full he is.  (while the poutine is advertised as a ""side"", my friends,  I assure you this is more like a dish and a half.  It's a full plate of fries and gravy goodness.) Next to arrive was the onion soup.  Sadly,  I was not a fan of the onion soup. It was loaded with lots of chunks of bread that tasted burnt. I prefer my onion soup to be loaded with cheese instead.  The broth itself had a nice taste to it,  and there was quite a bit of onions in the soup. The poutine arrives while I'm eating my soup. I look at it. There's no way in hell I'll be finishing this.  I mean, I'm so full,  I'm almost at the point where the mere sight of food makes me nauseous.  Anyway,  I feel obligated to eat a little of it while it's fresh.  Nothing special.  The guy next to me lied. The popular poutine shop nearby is just as good,  if not better. The fries are crisp, but the cheese just sits in the gravy unmelted, which lost points with me.  Gravy not bad, a smidge on the salty side.  I liked the flavor of the gravy at the other shop. Small cozy space.  Reservations are a must. Tables are close together,  as are the seats at the bar.  So in summary,  food isn't bad, but not consistent in their delivery.  Service sucks; they're too busy to be very attentive, they just take your order and clear your table.  Took me 10 minutes to flag someone down for the bill."

I also was impressed by the variety of  foie gras dishes to choose from. While it was fun trying the regional cuisine, flavor wise it was very heavy across the board and there were a few misses. I would still recommend this place to anyone trying to explore and learn the regional foods. Just make sure to make reservations in advance but if you can't make it, I'm sure there are many other alternatives around.Pros - the cromesquis was a perfect starter to the meal. One bite size of warm foie-gras infused gravy delight trapped in soft and pillowy donut-like bread. It really got our appetites going and we looked forward to the rest of the meal.The Foie gras poutine was very delicious and contrary to our concern of it being too heavy (gravy + cheese + fries + Foie gras = rich rich rich), the buttery Foie gras added a nice smooth finish as well as the Foie gras aroma without overpowering the dish.The charcuterie was a good balance of flavors - the cake was too sweet buy itself and the ham was too savory by itself. Combined together, it was a great counteract against each other and created a very enjoyable experience.Cons - the duck carpaccio just didn't work for us. It had smoked duck with pickled cucumbers, chives, raw mushroom, raw duck egg on top that was supposed to be eaten together with a warm bouillon. On paper, it should be hitting all of the flavor profiles but it just didn't come together. Everything tasted separately instead of tasting like a cohesive dish and i would not recommend this dish. The bouillon tasted just like any normal tempura dipping sauce so that was a big disappointment.And lastly just a personal taste, but the terrine has a very famed/livery finish and it could be a hit for someone who love lovers but not for me."

Highly recommend the melting pot dish as you get a little bit of all the meats they serve including boudin.  One of my other favorites here was the foie gras tacos, an interesting take! Also ate the duck in the can with foie gras and the PDC cut; these were both very heavy dishes, and I was over stuffed!  If you want to have a mouth'gasm and enjoy rich and fatty foods, a definite must."

Every. single. visit. This is a restaurant where you either get it or you don't. It is foie and meat heaven to the max, so if you don't like meat, ""heavy"" food, or only eat salads, I'm not sure what you will be able to eat here. However, if you're able to indulge in the goodness of hearty meats done exceedingly well in the Quebecois tradition, then there's really no restaurant quite like it.We've been coming here since 2014 and it's amazing how their basic menu has stayed almost exactly the same -- a testament that they are proud of what they do and they know they do it well.They always have a rotating menu of specials which we have found increasingly more and more intriguing each time we return, so we almost always get something from the specials menu and those recommendations have been excellent. If this is your first time, all the foie dishes are good and get their namesake dish just to see what it's like (warning: it's big enough for 4 essentially if you want to eat other things, but you can always pack it to go! My favorite memory here was when we sat next to someone who came in, ordered the PDC for herself, ate about half of it, and then packed the rest for her flight back to the US (is that allowed? lol)). Their frites fried in duck fat is out of this world -- almost the best duck fries I've ever had (interestingly enough #1 is from a random sandwich place in Cincinnati). As an aside, they actually have amazing baguettes that they'll keep bringing you (with decadent butter!) throughout the meal! If only I had like three stomachs so I can eat a whole stick of it...X___XSometimes I think of APC as an institution heralding the beginning of the nouveau celebrity chef movement. When APC was founded in 2001, Anthony Bourdain has not started hosting shows yet (his featuring of the restaurant on the show in 2006 helped introduce APC to international audiences) and Michelin guides did not exist in the Americas yet (2005). Many of the prominent celebrity chefs now were still establishing their footing or in varying stages of training during that time (almost 20 years ago!). APC has truly withstood the test of time.ps. Since they implemented an online reservation system it has been a lot easier to secure seats compared to the days of old when you had to show up first thing when they open in the hopes of finagling a table for later on in the evening (you can still do that now -- they save at least a 1/4 of the restaurant it seems for walk-ins, but the spots go quickly!)"

To start, we had fresh bread and butter that did not stop coming. I guess that didn't help with the fullness that I felt during the meal...I'm a sucker for bread. The foie gras poutine was amazing and I don't even like foie gras. I don't think you could compare this poutine to that of La Banquise. Just get it, you won't regret it.

If you are visiting Montréal and want to check two items off your Canada bucket list in one go, get the Foie Gras Poutine. It will be a stark difference from the poutines you may have had before and will have after that day due to the sheer perfection of the ingredients and the best gravy you will ever have. They have some daily specials, each one of which could compete to get on the daily menu easily. The cannelloni entrée was absolutely perfect. So much was going on in that dish that bewildered my palate and, like everything else on the menu, so heavy it was that it was hard to finish on my own. The sweetness of the sauce meshed absolutely perfect with the saltiness of the pork and duck.Finally, the dessert. Despite what its name suggests, the Maple Poudding Chômeur is no poor man's pudding. This amazing dessert is heavy and sugary and just so bad for you, yet you want to eat it anyway. The cake is shaped like an island and is covered by a sea of maple butter. The sugariness of the gooey maple will make the blood rush to your head, yet every bite will keep you interested. The service was superb. It is not everyday I go to fancy restaurants like this and I neither looked like the wealthiest nor the classiest customer, but the waiting staff made me feel welcome and took an absolute care in handling all my plates. Our bilingual waitress explained each dish to us carefully and offered her helpful advice in picking the dishes, which we heeded. This restaurant has been a bucket list item for me for over 2 years and I am glad to have finally checked it off my list. You should too."

And you get the point. I get it, they were busy. But the one guy could've just taken my order, I already knew what I wanted. But he seemed more concerned about getting the larger tables than cater to the solo dude at the bar. It wasn't until finally, the girl helping behind the bar came over and took my order. Once she took my order, things went pretty smoothly. The bread they give is divine. It's soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside. I don't even like bread but it went so well with their butter. This was followed by their bone marrow and caviar. The waitress made it sound like it was two little sticks. It was not. Holy meat butter goodness. The foie burger took awhile to assemble and I could see the whole thing happening since they have an open kitchen. This place is pure controlled chaos. It's amazing how everyone knows what to do with so much going at once. I probably lost 10 years of my life eating this burger but it did not disappoint.

I booked it prior to learning I was pregnant so obviously came for all of their great menu items, but figured I'd still be able to find a pasta and eat the duck in a can or other.Just as an FYI for pregnant women avoiding rare meat, raw egg, mayo, etc - pickings are slim but I was able to find some items. The PDC mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had. Overall, however, dishes were ok. We ordered halibut fish and chips (decent but huge portion), squid ink risotto (salty), almond green beans (ok), and maple creme brûlée (super good). I was so disappointed to learn I couldn't order the duck in a can since it was served rare. Also, the menu seems to change and they only have what's on there. Our reservation was for Sunday at 7:30pm, a few dishes were already gone and I overheard a lot of items I would've wanted to eat were gone by around 9pm so would recommend aiming for an earlier slot if there's something in particular youRegardless of how the food was, which I would've given a 4, my review is heavily focused on our waiter. Which was a shame because everyone else was extremely nice. It seemed if you didn't jive with his rapport of being loud and obnoxious, he didn't give you the time of day. When we spoke to him, he didn't even care to pay attention or give us eye contact and would talk over our table to talk to the tables drinking that he was schmoozing to check in on them. I don't care for being checked in on during a meal, but compared to tables around us, we got a fraction of the service and it was really obvious. He even forgot to put in our dessert order.Like I said, pretty shocked since this restaurant was hyped. Our waiter was definitely a buzz kill to our last night in Montreal."

We returned and asked if the reservation was valid: yes it was. We were told that it is because they don't normally accept walk-ins, which really sounded insincere to us. My partner and I are tourists hoping for a memorable time, but instead felt like we were discriminated against. The hostess offered no options whatsoever and was simply disappointing.

Each dish was more decadent than the last. Everything was outstanding and I left knowing that I indulged in the right place. We made our reservation about a month or so in advance and I definitely recommend you do the same as it is a rather small place and was crazy busy on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is modest and charming. It's a long, narrow room with a bar in the front and a wine cellar in the back. We sat in the back so it was a little cozier and not as bustling. We had to ask our waiter for a thorough run down on the menu and his recommendations on everything from dishes to how much to order. He was so helpful, spent a good amount of time with us and was very sweet. This place is famous for their Duck in a Can. We didn't order it but nearly every table around us did. It looked delicious pouring out of the can (they open it at the table). There was just too much else on the menu that I wanted to try and it had the feel of something more novelty and theatrical than just down right tasty,. Maybe I'm wrong, though. But on to food that I actually ate. We started with just classic foie gras which came with toasted french bread. I couldn't believe how much I loved it. You are going to have a lot of heavy, creamy dishes here. I liked starting with something tasty but simple. We also got the Ploque de Champlain, layers of potato slices, Canadian bacon, foie gras, pancake, and maple glaze... oh my god. Easily the best thing I ate that night. We had a few other appetizers and shared an entree and it was plenty. I can't recall the names of the other dishes. We ended this insane meal with pouding chômeur à l'érable - a cake kind of biscuit with house made maple syrup. Believe it or not, I really didn't love it. It just tasted like a biscuit or scone sitting in a very sweet sugar sauce. I would and hopefully will definitely return one day. It will be so hard to order other appetizers and entrees but I know I want to see the rest of this impressive menu.

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Always an epic meal. I returned 4 months after I first tried the ham from the shack appetizer. It's still a great dish, but they have cut some corners which unfortunately downgrades it from my previous review where I thought it was the dish of the year. Last summer they would bring an entire cured pig's leg tableside and crudely carve the prosciutto-like strips in front of you. This gave you nice uneven chewy pieces with a good distribution and ratio of meat to fat. You could see the knife marks on the meat and every bite was absolutely mesmerizing. This time, the carving was done away from the table. From the way the meat was all uniformly sliced, it seems they used a deli slicer on the thinnest setting. I find there is less flavour this way. It's still a great dish, but they would have to revert back to the old way of preparing it table side for this dish to reclaim its former greatness. In other news, I tried their onion soup which after Gibby's, is certainly one of the best in this city. Extremely rich, and drowning in french cheese, this soup is done right. My wife's burrata was also modified since the last time we visited. Last summer it came with delicious cherry tomatoes and blueberries. This time, it was accompanied by a tomato toasted piece of bread and more of the same sugar shack ham of which we already had an abundant supply at the table. It would have been nice if they told us that the same ingredient was being repeated in two appetizers. We would have ordered differently. Nevertheless, it was still delicious.Finally, despite my intention of having the duck in a can or the plogue a Champlain, I noticed they had a tartiflette on the menu. I've been hunting down this dish ever since I first heard of it on a cooking show years ago. Basically, it's supposed to be a scalloped potato casserole filled with cream and bacon in a pool of melted french cheese. PDC's version had the whole thing backed into a pie crust. It was exceptionally rich and delicious even though it had less cheese than I expected. At 38$, it is served in a huge portion and so I opted to have it as my main course, even though I feel it is better suited as a side dish. I would have like to see it offered in a smaller portion at 18$ so that it could reasonably accompany another main course. The problem is that PDC has too many good dishes! It's a good problem to have. For dessert, we shared one of the most epic apple pies I have ever tasted. The apples had been given some very loving treatment in which ever ounce of sweetness and richness was coaxed out of them. The crust stood on its own in all its flaky glory as all decent crusts must do. Topped with their maple ice cream, this was the final straw in the food coma that is inevitable with a visit to PDC.One gripe which I noticed last time is that their wine and champagne menu is absolutely off the charts in terms of price. We had been pre-drinking some prosecco at home and wanted to continue down that road. The most inexpensive bottle of anything with bubbles is in the neighbourhood of 130$. That's their bargain basement. The prices explode into the stratosphere from there. I'm not a wine expert and therefore, this sort of investment is not only ridiculously overpriced, it goes largely unappreciated. The champagne was great, but at nearly 175$, certainly not 10 times more enjoyable than the 17 dollar bottle I had earlier in the evening at home. I looked around the restaurant and noticed quite a few people drinking beer. I suspect, it's not because they really wanted to pair beer with this already heavy food, but rather, it's the only reasonably priced adult beverage served. It won't stop me from coming back though. As I've mentioned before, your best bet at this restaurant is to pre-drink and then take it easy during the meal. The food is so heavy that alcohol cannot compete with the duck, foie gras, pig, butter and other animal fats and oils with which your body must contend."

Thank you so much!!"

I remember sitting there drooling over the dishes thinking I have to go to Montreal just to try out this place. 12 years later, I finally had the opportunity to come here and experience it on my own. I have no idea how he managed to eat so many dishes cause I was stuffed just with the few plates we shared. This is a popular place so a making reservations a week before arriving landed us with a 9:30pm reservation on a Sunday night. We definitely had to plan our day and evening accordingly know we were going to eat a heavy meal late at night.I love the hustling and bustling feel of the place. Everyone is so excited to eat the food and the waiters are happy to serve the delicious plates. Our waiter however wasn't very helpful with food or drink suggestions. He basically shrugged and told us it depended on what we liked. That didn't dampen our spirits. We took a look around and decided to order what most people were eating. Can't go wrong with that. Tartare Temake - Tuna hand cone with a quail egg and spicy mayo served in a slab of wood. Great presentation, tasty and unique. The seaweed however could have been crispier though and it would have been nice to have a few more pieces for the price. 4/5 Fois gras poutine - lots of fois gras and squeaky curds on lightly fried fries; it was perfectly balanced where you almost had fois gras, cheese, gravy and fries with every bite. It's awesome that they are so generous with their fois gras. 4.5/5 because it was a little salty for me Duck in a Can - This was very special. They can the meal themselves in the morning, cook them fresh and serve the meal from the can at your table! It's a large portion of perfectly cooked medium rare duck and a piece of fois gras served on a squash puree.  5/5 We were stuffed so we didn't order any dessert and went for a long walk before returning home. We will have to make another trip to Montreal to try the other dishes for sure. If you can bring friends so you can share more dishes."

Water was always topped of before you notice and your request will be done in a few seconds.Kitchen staff worked their a** off for all customers. Not to say food was not worth that money, but for a highly praised restaurant there were definitely some detailing improvements one can made, like just seasoning the dish at the perfect amount.  I would say if the kitchen was even a bit larger for 1-2 additional helpers, then the cooking quality will be spetacular.Cochon dish was pleasant, but I must say it was indeed heavy and not hugely creative.One more thing, for this kind of restaurant you can still manage to have a decent meal for well under $40 with drink. A good pork dish with beer will make you satisfy quick."

It was a last minute reservation for 9pm a little later per our usual but nevertheless busy as ever. Service was great attentive and helpful, I'm always asking for recommendations, specials, favorites and the server was very accommodating. When we sat down, the table next to us was having a table show. Their server was torching a block of cheese and tossing their pasta in it. I thought I was sold but then we heard the specials which were all a share. We ordered the meatloaf (I make a killer meatloaf) wrapped in bacon and a side of poutine. Excellent beyond words, the influence of the food is pretty eclectic. Our meal seemed very German but the flavor of the sauce was more BBQ which was completely unexpected. Also the house bread was basically the bottom of great pizza crusty chewy Heaven-totally recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=2IYr8l5h0e3_3_fTcQJQtw,Renee P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First off, this was without a doubt one of the best meals I've had in my life. I went there with a few friends on Friday, and I ordered the fois gras with berries, and it was exquisite. We also ordered an appetizer with bison tartare and caviar on fresh oyster...also, wow! The service was exceptional. But there are a few reasons why I am giving it 4 stars not 5: 1) Cleaning the vents above the tables during service hours was just weird. They explained to us that they had to do this because otherwise the vents would drip water. But when they were cleaning it, little bits of dust / dirt were falling into our food, and this was definitely not okay. 2) At $13 and up for a small glass, the wine is just too pricey (thankfully, beer is only about $6/glass).3) My friend ordered the blood pasta. It took a while to get to our table -- she was fine with that. But when it did come, it was ...well, I don't know what blood pasta is ""supposed"" to taste like (who would? lol) but it did NOT taste good. I would not recommend this dish! I felt bad for her who had to wait but then didn't even like the food. I think they comped her a beer, but she did not get offered another type of dish or anything like that to make up for the wait and generally bad flavour. TIP: If you are going for the first time, describe to the server what types of flavours you like, what types of food you want to try, etc. They are extremely knowledgeable and should be able to help you find something you love. After reading the other reviews, it seems that there are a few things on the menu that were a ""miss"" with other customers too...so it's definitely worthwhile to be selective and ask a lot of questions as you order!"

Very savory.  Incredible.Dessert was an off menu Foie creation.  Because the wait staff noticed that our table was drawn to Foie Gras, they recommended we take a chance on the 'secret' dessert item.  Pound cake covered with a soft cheese and foie gras, coated with a caramel type syrup.  Super simple and inventive.  Sweet and salty, not the most attractive, but boy, was it tasty.Throughout the night, Flo stopped by our table checking in with us.  He shared shots of cognac with us at a few different times.  I can't remember ever getting such special treatment from a restaurant's Owner...oh, and BTW, they were full and busy the 3+ hours we were there.If you are in Montreal, this is a must try!  It will be memorable."

Their food is breathtaking, astounding, exquisite, and indelible, and you'll remember your meal for weeks, months, and years afterwards.I had reserved well over a month in advance and we received a nice table near the front of the restaurant, which was bright and sunny and didn't feel nearly as crowded and cramped as it could've.We were initially presented with complimentary bread and butter, and it was clear even at this stage that we were in for an above-average dinner. The crusty, fresh bread was delicious, but it was the butter that was the real winner. It tasted so much creamier and flavorful that normal butter, somehow. It was just so rich. Why isn't all butter like this?For our appetizer, we decided to go with the Foie Gras Cromesquis. I had read a few reviews with recommendations of this and it seemed like a simple, not-too-filling way to start our meal. A server brought over two dice-shaped concoctions and advised us to wait a full 60 seconds before popping the whole thing into our mouths. I'm not entirely sure what was in this thing, but it was glorious. As soon as you bite in, this sauce or gravy oozes into your mouth and it tastes amazing. I could've eaten a whole bowl of these things.For our main, we decided to share a couple of big-ticket items. First, we got the Foie Gras Poutine. I mean, would it surprise you to learn that this was amazing? The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese curds are squeaky, the gravy is sublime, and the pieces of foie gras are spectacular and so, so tasty.From there, we arrived at the piece de resistance of the entire outing: the infamous Duck in a Can. There's a great deal of showmanship that goes along with this dish, as the can is opened at the table by a server and the contents are poured onto a waiting plate. (And yes, we kept the can.) But oh my god is this thing amazing. Everything in this concoction is next-level in terms of flavors and textures, with the perfectly-cooked duck and rich gravy nothing short of delectable. This is one of the best things I've eaten in my entire life, hands down.Our dessert was the Maple Poudding Chômeur and it is, of course, delicious. It's basically cake sitting in a syrupy liquid, and it's addictive. I wouldn't have minded some ice cream in there to kind of cut through the intense sweetness, but this is an extremely minor complaint.So why, you must be asking yourself, am I giving what was clearly a stellar meal four stars instead of five? The service. While I have nothing but praise for the incredibly friendly folks who brought us our food, our waitress was horrible. She took our order and we didn't see her again until it was time for the bill. This is not an exaggeration. I initially ordered a beer and probably would've had two or three more, but nobody asked if I wanted another. Like I said, other folks in the restaurant did stellar work and made sure our water was always topped up, but there really is no excuse for such ambivalent service from a waitress in a joint like this."

They were huge, meaty garlic buttery goodness and we destroyed 2 orders- Poutine - Standard goodness- Foie gras - amazing, tasty, rich- Duck in a can - it's a half duck with other ingredients literally canned and then boiled for 27 minutes and opened table side onto a plate of potatoes. Texture was unreal- Stuff PDC (Stuffed pig's foot) with foie gras. Decadent, rich, fatty- Pasta made in a wheel of cheese table side - they toss it around which melts the cheese and coats the pasta.

/user_details?userid=tOjRIW2n3bhTtwmGclCHcw,Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"A weekend spent in Montreal with friends led us to this restaurant - in recommendation from a few people who had been before. We made reservations for dinner at 10:30pm (all that was available) and made sure to get in our steps before coming in. We were seated promptly when we arrived and we found the host - who was also acting Sommelier that evening - to be very warm and pleasant (and he made some pretty darn tasty wine recommendations)As a group of 4 we ordered the following, to eat family style, I would say that overall this was a reasonable amount of food for 4 very hungry people, but we didn't quite make it through all of the mains and left very very full (but not so stuffed that I wanted to unbutton my high waisted jeans for whatever that's worth):     AppsWhite Ham - really pretty delicate ham, not too fatty, not what you think of from your local deli, served thinly sliced with thin slices of cheese, they apparently raise the animals they use themselves, and I will say that this was an nice example of why quality of protein mattersFoie Gras Poutine - rich! Came with 2 different types of sauce, I preferred the foie sauce, but found the foie gras medallions on top to be over kill.  I'm glad we shared this plate 4 ways, and glad we tried it, but I wouldn't get it again, and opt instead for poutine elsewhere     MainsDuck in a Can - Yum! My favorite of the things we ordered. Other reviewers have pretty accurately summed up the cooking process so I won't get into that again, but I will say that it came out perfectly done and while rich, it made me want to keep going back to it, something about the tanginess of the vegetables was really nice. I would get this again, but I wish that texturally there was something to crunch this up. Stuffed PDC - the is basically a pig leg that's been scooped, turned into a terrine, re-stuffed and cooked. I didn't really care for this dish, and I normally love terrine. I think that the fact that it was warm might have partially turned me off, but I also just felt like the dish was one dimensional.      Desserts Maple Creme brûlée - it's crewmen brûlée made with maple. Sweet, creamy, delicious, but not mind-blowingMaple pudding chômeur - think bread pudding, but different. It was really tasty hot, but as it cooled then texture changed. I would eat this again, but won't crave it. Overall this was a really nice meal, service was friendly and appropriately attentive (though we were served primarily by the Somm, not a waitress). I understand why this place gets recommended, and I'm glad we went, but all 4 of us agreed that we won't be returning on our next trip to Montreal just because there are sooooo many other wonderful places to try. I would recommend having this experience at least once (come hungry and plan for a walk afterwards) but don't assume that this is all Montreal cuisine has to offer."
/user_details?userid=EEM2_DmV0nsSBHto1D5EuQ,Michael M.,"Greensboro, NC",5 star rating,"I've had good meals, and great meals. But here -- at Au Pied de Cochon --  I had a truly special meal. First off, our waiter Sam was amazing. The fantastic rapport we had with him elevated everything from just another good meal into an experience worth ranting over. We started with a fantastic bottle of local Riesling which he recommended based on our love of high mineral content wines. It was the perfect complement for the meal to come. The cromequis were the perfect amuse bouche, which we ate one bite. After we swallowed Sam rapped the dish on the table and we were welcomed to Au Pied de Cochon. After that point I knew we were in for a treat. The nigiri -- which came next -- was a highlight. An inventive use of foie gras that used the spoon it was served on as a vessel to have the rice absorb the homemade sauce we sent down the handle into the bowl. Next came a foie gras ma po tofu and an amazing tart. The ma po tofu was the right amount of Sichuan ma and just a hint of la spiciness that  accented but did not overwhelm the rest of the specialness of the ingredients. The tart sported a delicate béchamel sauce and flaky crust that played well with the blood sausage and foie gras that sat atop. The entire time as we ate Sam would check in with us, refilling our wine glasses, and pausing to explain each dish and what made each one special. Then, dessert. Dessert started with the three of us taking a shot of amaro to drill a hole through what was an exquisitely rich meal. We looked at the menu and saw several things that looked good, but Sam asked us if we trusted him. At this point I would have followed him to Mordor and back. We did and he went out and ordered an off menu dessert for us. What came back was simply decadent. I won't say what it was. Just go to this place, put your trust in the staff and they won't steer you wrong."

I would ordinarily never eat at a place like this since everyone knows that a) pork tastes just like human flesh and b) pigs are smarter than dogs. However, I was with a group and my objections were overruled. I planned on enjoying the wine and getting a slice of pizza later, but as it turned out, there is more to this place than pork and foie gras!They have an emphasis here on fresh and made to order, so unfortunately, a few of the items that I thought I could stomach, such as the garlic whelks, were unavailable. Also, they insist on defiling many of the vegetables with cheddar, the most offensive of the cheeses, and charcuterie. But as luck would have it (for me, at least), the night before our visit, a hapless, 200-pound tuna enjoying a swim in the brisk waters off the coast of Nova Scotia was ensnared by Au Pied's supplier's nets, so there was a great deal of tuna available on the menu. The server advised that our food would take about an hour to arrive and encouraged us to order an appetizer, so we started with the coppa pizza. The wonderful cheese pie (NOT cheddar, thankfully!) was crowned with a salad of arugula, nutty Parmesan and easily removable charcuterie. Just to up the ante, the server poured a mix of hot and spiced oils to dress the salad. The food arrived - a variety of pork products topped with foie gras for the others; two obscenely large tuna steaks for moi - and we dug in. The tuna was quite simply the best I have ever had. Perfectly seared and simply seasoned with cracked pepper, the briny taste of the Atlantic was allowed to take center stage. The tuna rested atop a bed of what I sincerely hope was a pork-free polenta and was garnished with some cheddar-less asparagus. Divine!The restaurant thought ahead and considered the richness of their food in designing their bathrooms, which are equipped with fancy Japanese toilets with fountains, blowers and heated seats. Then hand dryer was out of order and I considered using the toilet to dry my hands, but reconsidered. We were too full to contemplate dessert, but the dessert menu does feature a great deal of confections incorporating maple. There is also a park about 2 blocks away and I suggest doing as we did and taking a stroll after your meal to aid in digestion.A final note; the wait staff is wonderful. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, and our server was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu - both wine and food. Top notch!"

I'm not a huge fan of cheese curds, so we essentially didn't eat that part, but I'm sure it's good as well. We were literally full on the poutine already...DUCK IN A CAN: Another must order here. That day's version was cooked with sweet potatoe puree on the bottom. A thick slice of duck breast attached to a large piece of fat, with a very generous hunk of foie gras sandwiched in between. Umami bomb would be an accurate description. The duck was very tender and well rendered. We unfortunately couldn't finish the whole thing, but I made sure to polish off the foie though!Everything was delicious. Really the only reason I didn't give full 5 stars was because it's a meal that doesn't make you feel good afterwards. We ingested probably 5000 calories.

It was a relatively cold night (~-10) and as soon as we got in we were struck by the amazing smell of food and the warm cozy atmosphere and the buzz of tables and the  waiters running around. Walking in, the most striking feature is the brick oven in the kitchen at the heart of the restaurant. Luckily, we sat right next to the kitchen, best spot IMO for 1st visit, and got to watch all the dishes coming out of the kitchen.  Before i ramble about the food, i should point out that the service was excellent: i saw about 6 servers working together in an  impressively cohesive manner. Everyone was kind and friendly and they answered all our questions patiently with a pleasant dose of humor.Sadly, all daily specials were suitable for groups of 3 or more (or 2 really really hungry people who don't care too much about dessert). For this reason and generally the generous size of the dishes, i think the restaurant is experienced more fully by groups of 4 or more.We got foie gras poutine, tarragon tongue, duck in a can, maple creme brulee and maple pudding chomeur. The poutine was the best I've had in Montreal. The froie gras totally melted in my mouth and the gravy was rich, tasteful and satisfying. The tarragon tongue included about 5 thin pieaces of tongue, sitting in a hearty sauce garnished with a few small pieces of carrots and pickles.  The tongue pieces were tender and juicy, and the sauce was the kind of flavor you wanted to taste as slowly as possible so that maybe you'll get to know it better  :D it was rich, smooth and sophisticated.  I think duck in a can is a classic at this place. Half a duck, foie gras, cabbage and garlic  have been sitting together in a can until they are boiled for about half an hour and served on a piece of crunchy bread and sweet potato puree. Sure, the duck is rare and tasty, but the rest, the mixture of cabbage and garlic marinated in duck fat and broth in a can with a bit of crunch bread is the kind of homey flavor that might be worth dying for, gastronomically speaking!I'm not a fan of maple pudding chomeur and i have to admit PDC didn't change my mind: it is just bland, pointlessly sweet and without a texture at all. Creme brulee was nice but not the best I've had: the custard was ok  but half the caramel was burnt black. It's very sad when a meal doesn't end on high noteSo, yes i want to go back soon, ideally before summer starts and with a group of fun friends to share more dishes with :)"

The resto is small and you must reserve way in advance. It's a warm ambiance and service is super friendly. The max  group they take is 10.  This resto is perfect for birthday celebrations, date night or friends night out. Most importantly you must go with others who are not picky eaters and enjoy pork and foie gras. The menu is on the pricey side but the food quality and presentation is worth every penny!  Worth it to try out at least once! Their menu is also seasonal and changes. The food was absolutely delicious and beautiful presentations!  We had the foie gras cubes which were mouth-watering and amazing!  I then tried the duck in a can which was awesome!   It lived up to expectations! Every single bite was yummy!  Lastly we had dessert, pecan pie for sharing topped with maple ice cream!  So heavenly tasting!! Sweet lovers delight! It is expensive but so worth to try at least once..a real foodie experience!!"

Free street parking was available when we went there on Sunday night at approx. 9PM. [SERVICE] - 5/5Our server was very friendly and personable. She helped us out with the menu and recommended several of their signature items. [DÉCOR] - 4/5 Traditional and iconic Montreal vibes. At one point, the place got very warm and smoky because of the oven(s). [QUALITY] - 5/5The food was the pinnacle of fine dining in Montreal with high-quality ingredients and complex flavours in each dish. [ORDER] - 4/5- Plogue a Champlain - $29.00: buckwheat pancake topped with cheese, potatoes, bacon, and fois grois. The dish was both sweet and savoury. Fois grois melted in my mouth. Portion was small so I had to savour each bite.  - Duck in a Can - $44.00: came with an actual can and is heated with boiling water. The duck was very fatty and tender, and accompanied with cabbage. - Pig's Head - $120.00: the star of our meal! Our server informed us that this would take quite a while to prepare (approx. 45 mins) which is why she recommended we enjoyed other dishes in the meantime. Every single part of the head was edible (except the bones and teeth). The skin was crispy, and every bite of meat was a melt-in-my-mouth experience. The head was stuffed with the most tender octopus tentacles, bison meat, and came with a side of squid ink risotto and spinach. [OVERALL] - 4/5 All the dishes were very rich, fatty, and delicious. This type of food is a great treat once in a while, but I wouldn't eat this every day because I felt like all the fat was going to clog my arteries! Overall, I was glad I dined at one of the best traditional restaurants in Québec."

The sweetness was overwhelming. The duck in a can was good but there was a big piece of duck fat. Since we shared this dish, we each had a small piece of duck meat. The duck meat itself was very tasty and perfectly cooked. The sweetness of the other dish overpowered everything so it made it hard to enjoy anything else.The service - the waiter did not come to see us aside from taking our order.

If you are not a sushi restaurant, then don't serve Japanese dishes if you can't get the basics right!There wasn't one single dish that was memorable as they most likely tasted very similar.The dishes are very filling as they are heavy so you need to share your dish...I would say order 2 mains for 3 people.I have also been to their sugar shack many times and only the first time was good...Take my word for it...you won't be blown away so spend your money elsewhere...unless money is no issue and you want to try it since it is so well known."

For 2, we ordered the bluefin tuna tartare, apple and foie gras, and the duck in a can (2 apps, 1 main). It was all delicious, great flavour, and a lot of the food is sourced from their farm. The menu is a bit simple, but our waitress was great with explaining how each dish was prepared, and was very friendly and attentive. The cream base for the tartare was a bit strong for my liking, especially for the delicate and delicious tuna. Our favourite dish was the apple and foie gras - ham stuffed apple, seared foie gras and boudin (dark pig blood sausage), on a bed of picked cabbage and mashed potatoes. It was the perfect combination for the breezy end of summer meal with the apple and pork. The duck in a can was surprisingly moist, but very oily. Not sure if we would order it again because there wasn't a lot of variety of texture or flavour, but it was still tasty."

I even asked waiter if there were something light and he basically drew a blank.  Lightest thing they got was just a whole roast duck but meh.  Not what we came here for and that's not really light fare anyway. Foie gras nigiri (sushi) was just a slice of foie gras on rice on spoons. They used some kind of sesame oil/paste instead of wasabi and served it with ponzu sauce.  Yes, it was as uninspired and greasy sweet as it sounds.  It's not awful if you happened to like the condiments but the subtle foie gras sweetness was all gone.  It just wasn't very tasty.The carpaccio just had way too much oil. I thought it was just greasy and bland and my wife found it inedible until she put it on the bread. Even then she thought she might as well just dipped the bread in olive oil.The bread was served hot and tasted okay, once you get rid of the crust that was just too thick.The PDC with foie gras was just gross.  It's a big pig feet with a block of foie gras on top. It was blandly seasoned so the fat from the pig foot itself was just sickly, which was made only worse by the foie gras.  The crispy skin on the pig foot was so thick we couldn't cut it with a butcher carving knife.  It was basically carbonized and mostly inedible. It was basically a horrible rendition of Ecuadorian (or some other Latin America country) roast pork that was over roasted and under seasoned.I almost rated the place 1 star but I usually reserve 1 star for restaurants with basically no redeeming value. The foie gras nigiri wasn't great but it was pleasant for me since I liked the condiments and foie gras to begin with. The bread was warm and tasted fine with butter, once you removed some of the crust.  The entire PDC pig foot did have small bits of good meat (like 10% of it). The service was friendly and prompt.But still, the food was uninspired and poorly executed. If you travel, just don't come here. If you don't, well, maybe this is the only place this indulgent in all of Montreal."

The food was so good but the terrible dining experience we had really ruined it for us. I'm not one to complain about a waiter. I get it. It's a busy job and you have to wait on so many different tables it can get crazy. Out waiter was pretty rude. He treated us like we were stupid. He would spend 2 second at our table, giving not much help with the menu and didn't come back for 20 mins at a time. Our entire dinner lasted almost 3 hours and a lot of that was waiting. He was very short with us and always seemed to be in a rush. I thought initially maybe ""it's busy and he's like this with everyone.""No. He spent 25 minutes, I am NOT exaggerating, talking to the couple next to us when giving them their bill. Talking about everything under the sun. We had gotten to the restaurant 20 mins before this couple and he checked in with them constantly. They were not from the area so I don't think he knew them prior. We were obviously waiting for our bill and he didn't even move. After our entree another waiter actually had to take over for him and I thought he left! Nope. Still there. Being rude. He didn't wait on us one time after we ordered our entree but he had enough time to talk to the table next to us for 25 minutes? After we were seated far before them? Ok. I felt brushed to the side and forgotten. Terrible dining experience. Not to mention he was taking shots with them at the end like ok. You have enough time to take a shot with customers but can't even bring us our bill? K. Other than that. Food is phenomenal. Duck in a can. Get it.

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I learned about Au Pied de Cochon years ago, from a comic book about Martin Picard's life before the creation of the restaurant. It was a beautiful book, and although it didn't showcase much of the food, the story made me curious. After I moved to Montreal, I had the chance to eat there. A visiting friend from New York had reserved a table for her last night in town. It was one of the first times I ate at an ""expensive"" restaurant, but it almost didn't feel like it. I was certainly younger than most patrons, and was quite intimidated upon entrance. But after a few minutes, the welcoming and warm atmosphere of the place made me feel at ease.The wooden interiors of the place reminds of a cozy, fancy cottage. The buzzing sound of conversations and laughter was cheerful and vibrant. The staff was cordial and professional. It felt great to be surrounded by a friendly crowd and about to have a mighty good meal. I ordered the famous Foie Gras poutine. My friend had the Duck in a Can. Both dishes were impressive, but also quite overwhelming toward the end. It was the first time I had foie gras and I loved it! It's easy to see why Au Pied de Cochon has achieved such renown in Montreal and worldwide. It is not only authentic to its birthplace, but to itself as well.Anecdote: As I was taking a picture of my friend, I noticed a middle aged man pointing at my camera - the strap was dipping in my olive oil dish - I promptly moved it away and smiled to the guy to thank him. That's when I realised he was Chef Picard! :o"
/user_details?userid=tvUeQr3tW1npn3JGLWvAzQ,curtis k.,"Santa Monica, CA",2 star rating,"I was excited to bring my family here tonight - my last visit was solo in 2008. What I recall about my original experience was decadent lobster and foie and poutine. My decade-plus in waiting; needless to say I was pretty excited. The hostess was very sweet and kindly sat us without reservation at 5pm. Sadly, this would be the last good thing we would experience tonight.  The menu was generally unappetizing but I wasn't concerned as I knew the specials was where it was at. Meet the waiter who is a total dick. He resented that we didn't speak menu French and would therefore require his help, which I naively assumed my 20% would cover. One vignette- I asked him what kids typically like to eat here. Waiter responds snootily ""it really depends on how adventurous your kids are"" to which I clarified ""let's say our kids aren't very adventurous, what then would your recommend?"" To which he circled back to ""it really depends"" as if blaming me for taking us into this idiotic loop. When I then asked for the specials, I was reprimanded with ""we stopped serving specials years ago""Started with poutine and a couple French onion soups. Poutine - fries were pretty excellent, gravy and curd just average. Onto the soup- I would have been real happy with just French bistro style French onion soup but this was a deeply ham hocked soup that just tasted like ham- no chicken stock or beef stock, no slow roasted carmelized onion just pork. Gross. But at this point we were still quite hungry. So we would have eaten anything and paid anything for that anything. We were a hungry and forgiving audience and totally extended APC the benefit of the doubt. Main courses -Duck in a can - innovative preparation and presentation where they unload this prepared meal from a can onto a plated grilled bread and celery root purée. The duck had the consistency more of organ meat than confit duck. The foie was limp, with the consistency of flan. And the craziest thing about this dish was this prominently plated one inch thick flap of yellowish fat that had encircled the meat whilst cooking and should have been discarded when served. This is typical APC- they show an almost macho bravado for offal and fat and massive calorie bombs regardless of how poor the food actually turns out. I was reminded of the Will Ferrell and Tina Fey sketch on SNL where they eat hunks of wild game in a jacuzzi while alluding to lovemaking. Maybe this restaurant is satire to cool montrealers but cruel punishment to those tourist outsiders like me who aren't in on the joke? My wife ordered the tagine of pork. We had good experiences with Moroccan tagines and thought this a safe choice given the absence of offal, just ""braised pork"". Forty five (!) minutes elapsed after the onion soup's arrival as two waiters came by with a massive clay tagine pot that they tilted and literally dumped out onto the plate flops of dried stewed pork. We didn't know what to make of this yet as the presentation was so disorienting - this gargantuan quantity of dried meat with absolutely no attempt at plating or variation in color, accoutrement, vegetable anything at all. We tentatively hacked off our first (and last) bites - all three of us shocked by how salty and oddly flavored this pork was. Not much execution here at all - it tastes like pure salt and cumin. That's it. No depth, subtlety anything to offer at all.  Keep in mind that our three bites constituted perhaps one fiftieth of the total meat on the plate. We were just stunned, spending the next day fifteen minutes discussing how confusing this dish was....How could a restaurant as exalted and celebrated and impossible-to-get-into serve this food? Our waiter came by and didn't care to notice we had barely touched our main course nor did we show any signs of revisiting given I asked for the desert menu. No ""how was everything"" or any probing at all. Maybe desert could redeem this experience. We ordered the pecan pie with maple ice cream. It was absolutely delicious. The flakiest and most delicious crust, infused with their namesake shack maple syrup and allowed us to end on a slightly better note. And we enjoyed two bottles of nice wine, mostly because we had nothing else to do in the nearly hour between courses. I was deeply disappointed by this place."

The other customers who sat beside us were so much fun and that elevated our experience. The bartender was also friendly and offered us free drinks as well. We ended up with duck in a can, and the poutine. My husband loved the duck in a can, not only because it was fun to eat but also it was really tasty. I had a small bite and it was pretty good and I don't even like fois gras. My poutine was pretty delicious as well. I couldn't finish all my foir gras so I just left it.

That pork chop was so delicious, its hard to do it justice with words.  Also terrific were their other dishes, from the fiddleheads, to the clever foie nigiri with peanut sauce (easier to drizzle than to dip), to the calamari pasta, to the crab salad with milk dressing (again, remarkably good), to the duck fat fries.  I am getting hungry again just thinking about our meal.The best part is that the service here is warm and professional and completely up to the terrific food.

This room is a classic for a reason.The restaurant is a temple of decadence. There are a lot of hits on this menu, and it is worth bringing friends so that you can extend your coverage. A standout of our meal was the maple ham, which arrives tableside in its own pot, before being ceremoniously lowered onto the cutting board where prodigious slabs are carved off and placed steaming on your plate. Afterwards, it is doused in an unbelievable maple-foie-gras sauce (""It's a keeper"", our server said). The foie gras poutine, French onion soup and Melting Pot (half a dozen pork products adorning a mess of cheese-laden potatoes) are all also worth sampling.However impossible it may seem, save room for dessert. Maple is as much a theme here as pig or foie-gras, and the maple-toffee covered ice cream is a perfect finish to the meal."

Ambiance - it was likely just where we were sat but this is where I felt the experience could have been better. The weather was gorgeous on the evening we went, so if we had sat closer to the open storefront there would have been less crowding and a little more tolerable music volume (of which was a tad too high for conversation).Food - the foie gras poutine and the Duck in a can stand out big time on this menu.

The duck in a can was fun and entertaining to watch as it's opened table side and your whole meal slides out of a tin can. I'd love to come back again to try their other menu foie items and of course get a foie nigiri order all to myself. Until then, I can only reminisce about the heavenly nigiri."

First off, amazing staff. Everyone is friendly and patient!! The latter is important when trying to figure out which dish to select since there are no explanations on the menu. The menu itself is a foise gras lovers dream. Great selection of their take on foise gras. The naked selection was our favorite. Ordered the bison tartar and WOW. Out of this world. The tiny little quail egg for drizzling is just perfect. We wanted to order ten more! And for the main event. Pig shank with risotto. Wish we grew another stomach. Huge portion. Falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. Must experience this place when in Montreal!!!"

This place is Foie Gras heaven, Foie Gras extraordinaire!! I mean, if you like Foie Gras, definitely come here and taste their many different variations of it...and that we did.We started off with their sashimi appetizer on top of this rock salt thing and also their poutine with..you guessed it, Foie Gras! Delicioso!!!  They also paired it with a yummy red wine!Unfortunately for our main course, we had this meat plate that didn't live up to our expectations. It was all boiled meats that was chicken, bone marrow, sausage and maybe even duck. It's ok though, we wanted something a little risqué, but it didn't hit the mark.Service was still awesome as they accommodated everything we wanted to try. They constantly checked in on us and gave us recommendations for the next time and even other places to try in the area. Staff is definitely amazing and would come again and try some other stuff."

Arrived early and was seated which was a bonus as the place was packed. Lots of bodies buzzing around - it's loud, but we loved the vibe. Service was attentive - plates cleared immediately, water glasses filled, bread and butter refilled as well - and friendly - we were looked after by three amazing staff. We ordered the blue cheese salad (loved the walnuts with the endive), foie gras poutine (the best gravy I've ever had - used the amazing bread to mop up every last drop), and the pork shank with risotto which was one of the specials that night. Omg so much food and so very good. We were so full that we didn't order dessert, so sad :(. Can't wait to go back next time we are in Montreal."

Came with my husband, brother and sister in law and we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We tried the tartar temaki, French onion soup, plogue a Champlain, duck in a can, poutine and cured foie grad & boudin tart. My two favourite dishes were the tartar temaki and plogue a champlain. The temaki was so fresh with the crispy seaweed and creamy from the quail egg on top. Everything about this hand roll was delish! The plogue a champlain was a buckwheat pancake with potato, bacon, cheese and foie gras drizzeled with what I think was a maple syrup of some sort. The flavours of everything mingled so well together. The bacon was to die for and obviously the foie gras was delicious. I would come here and order this again. The infamous duck in a can to me was a little overwhelming. About two bites in and I couldn't eat a whole lot more. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but oh so heavy. This is definitely something I would recommend to share amongst at least 4 people. The plate started with a crouton and some purée and then the can was emptied on top. Inside the can they had cooked foie gras, a slice of duck, a giant slab of fat and a bunch of cabbage and veggies in a gravy. It was an explosion of flavours, but a bit too high in cholesterol for me. I wasn't impressed with the French onion soup, poutine or the tart, but my sister in law loved it. To me the flavours of each were too rich and heavy, but not in a good way. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was pretty casual. I would definitely be back to try some other foie gras dishes."

And then the food came and it was time to get serious. First up was a crab and cucumber salad - a special for the day.  The presentation was simple but nice: a bed of shaved cucumber bathed in a creamy dressing (that looked a bit like Hollandaise sauce), topped with a generous layer of crab meat, topped with a green garnish of some sort.  The crunchiness of the cucumbers worked well with the tenderness of the crab meat, and as I bit into the salad, I was surprised to find fresh mint buried between the crab and cucumbers.  Great layers of textures and tastes in this one.  My second dish was the tart with cured foie gras.  This one was interesting.  A tart the size of a personal pizza, topped with a sharp cheese that had been toasted and left to harden a bit.  Beneath the hardened cheese oozed a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinaigrette.  And on top of it all, four slices of foie gras. Biting into the tart, there was the nice crunch from the flaky crust, the sharpness of the cheese, the tanginess of the balsamic vinaigrette, and the sweetness of the foie gras.  Again, a weird blend of flavors but somehow it worked!  This was delicious and really rich.For my third dish (and this was me absolutely indulging), I went for the homemade boudin. This was actually my favorite: light, fluffy mashed potatoes topped with fat pieces of boudin, garnished with cooked apples and sauteed cabbage and onions.  The boudin melts in your mouth and there's some kind of magic that happens when you add the tender apples and the sweet cabbage and onions.  Amazing.  I would have liked to have gone for dessert, but I literally could not fit another bite of anything in my mouth.  I didn't even finish the boudin (I took it home of course).  This was a one-of-a-kind dining experience and an absolute must-do in Montreal.  The service was also excellent.  So yes, make a reservation and indulge!"

This is my all-time favourite restaurant in Montreal and I have been here countless times with different people who all grow to love it as well. If you love foie gras and meat, this is the place for you. They have so many foie gras options, it's insane. The naked foie gras is a classic pan seared foie gras in a red wine sauce. I love that they have very original options too such as the foie gras nigiri, foie gras cheung fun - if you're Chinese, it's exactly as it sounds with the rice noodle wrapped around foie gras with a soy sauce... super light tasting, very amazing. The foie gras poutine is mind-blowing and you must try it. Every time you visit they will have specials that are based on fresh seasonal ingredients. Can't recommend this place enough!"

This was my second trip to PDC and both have been really enjoyable dining experiences. The staff are really pleasant and work hard to create a memorable meal for the diners. I had the foie gras burger, poutine, and maple pie. The burger was incredible. Between the foie gras, the cheese, the bacon, and beef there was a lot of fat here, this is a compliment. Definitely worth the $$ there isnt really another burger out there like it. The poutine had a really nice pepper gravy with excellent curds. Very happy with my choice but I also tried the duck in a can and the hot chicken. Both were equally as amazing, I just can't pass up foie gras on a burger. Finally, the maple pie was awesome. Really nice buttery, flaky crust with a rich maple filling. Summary: there is a reason why this restaurant is so popular, it's really good."

In short, this place the manifestation of gluttony. Their menu includes a sizable number of greatest hits, but make sure to check out the specials. On the last visit this included a lobster served with obscene amounts of house made caviar. (WHO FARMS THEIR OWN CAVIAR?!)The wine list is fairly deep and pretty interesting. The sommelier definitely had some great choices available, despite him being unnecessarily full of himself when questioned on the lack of sauternes in a restaraunt that probably serves metric tonnes of foie gras.Worth going out of your way to visit.Make sure you book your reservation a ways out, this place stays full."

I really regret not ordering the French Onion Soup because it looked delicious. We had a front row seat at the bar facing the kitchen, so we were able to see the chefs cook and all the food coming out. It was a great experience however after a 6 Hour drive from New York, I would've preferred a table. However, this was not the restaurant that I intended to go to for dinner so I did not make a reservation thinking that it would not be too crowded at 5:45 PM. Boy was I wrong, all tables were reserved so we took seats at the bar and by the time we left the line was out the door.Food was good, the tartare was phenomenal and the service was excellent but I really don't see the hype. But then again, I should've found out what boudin was before ordering it. I saw a tart, saw foie, and I was sold. I didn't realize it was a tart made up of blood sausage. I don't like blood sausage and the tart itself was way too salty. The pork shank was way too salty as well, however the risotto was perfectly cooked. I would give this place another try if I had opportunity, I feel I ordered all the wrong dishes. The duck in a can looked really interesting and the hen stuffed with offal and foie sounded pretty amazing, but since we're only in Montreal for 3 days, not going to happen."

Dinner service took almost three hours for us, so don't make plans to be anywhere after. Service was very friendly and attentive. The food. Our table was right next to the ovens where the fresh-baked bread was coming out--to die for. They kept refilling it and we kept eating it, which we would regret later. The foie gras poutine was the best poutine I've had. I was worried it would be too rich based on the reviews but it was just right. Delectable. The portion is adequate for two people but I would come back and order it just for myself. The maple creme brulee was also wonderful.Now onto the just OK food: the duck carpaccio was very tasty but I could barely taste the duck with all the dressings. We still enjoyed it though. The pigs head: an experience more than anything else. I'd recommend this for a large group of 4-6 to share but not as an entree for two because it's so rich and fatty. My husband enjoyed his tapioca pudding and their teas are delightful.I would come back here if I'm ever in Montreal but I'd stay away from the heavier/greasier options like the pig's head. We were so full that we didn't want to eat the next day, practically until dinner.Would definitely come back here."

I have heard through word of mouth that people can wait weeks to months for a spot. The service from beginning until end was A1, accommodating and helpful when it came to the order. We loved everything from oysters, to their famous decadent ""fois gras"" and pork. This is an absolute artisanal Montreal restaurant experience. Lastly, they also have a sugar shack that my boyfriend attended for a business meeting and said ""it was hands down succulent and explosive in flavour"". If you are a meat lover, particularly with pork and ""fatty"" textures, and enjoy the combination of sweet maple... You must must come here.Ambiance is also very classy with wood inside to imitate the look of a sugar shack."

Was. Right.  The soup, which had all the traditional components of beef stock, onions, crouton and deliciously melted cheese had a little kick of meat which made it more filling than normal.  I would recommend this dish when you visit!Beef Tongue with Tarragon - sounds different... I'm a big fan of beef tongue but I'll have to be honest and say that I've only really had it during hot pot or korean bbq.  The Tarragon sauce was delicious, the beef was so soft and it practically melted in your mouth.  If you're one of those ""not sure about tongue"" this dish is definitely a great way to try it for the first time!Fg Poutine - delicious! delicious! Gravy was delicious and there were good pieces of foie gras throughout.  The fries are also fried in duck fat (yes please!)Fg Plogue à Champlain - Suggested to us by our waiter.  Imagine, a light pancake, light mashed potato, top with melted cheese and then the whole thing is topped in foie gras and drizzled with the most delicious syrup.... we were all fighting for the last piece.Wine/Cocktailes - great selection of wine and they had 2 special cocktails that night.  We opted for a french wine and it accompanied our meal throughout.This was our favorite restaurant when visiting Montreal.  The service was excellent, and the service team were so cohesive, they really worked together in such a tight space with a big crowd of people.  The food ,even better, I dream about fg to this day.  I highly recommend a visit when coming to Montreal just don't hesitate to make a reservation - the line was out the door and it was freezing!"

I love this place! If you are a fan of fois gras and decadent food you must visit this place! You definitely need to make reservations far in advance. This place gets booked up quickly. I recently went here on my first visit to Montreal and it made for the perfect last meal in this city. The menu changes so you might not always see some items on there and another issue is that the menu is not very descriptive at all. I suggest browsing on yelp to get more in depth descriptions of the food or just ask your server and they can give you a run down if you have any questions about anything. On this visit, we ordered the fois gras terrine, cured ham from the Shack, duck magret, and stuffed PDC with fois gras. The fois gras terrine came with a few pieces of toasted bread and some maple syrup. This was one of the best terrines I've had. It was very smooth, had a delicious taste that was rich but not overpowering. I slathered the terrine over my bread and drizzled a little syrup on top (delish!). Next up was the cured ham from the Shack. I would say this is more like prosciutto than ham, but they aren't able to call this prosciutto since its not from Italy (or that's what the server said). They bring this beautiful leg of ham to your table and carve it right in front of you. I thought this dish would just be the ham (again menu is not descriptive enough), but it actually comes with a plate of these warm fluffy round pancakes (similar to a beignet) that have a maple syrup glaze over them. You pair the cured ham with the pancakes and the sweet and savory combination makes you do a little happy dance in your chair. So so good. I love the saltiness of the ham and it goes so well with these pancakes. Next dish was the duck magret, which is duck breast with potatoes, mushrooms and a delicious sauce. Order this if you love duck! The piece de resistance of our meal was the stuffed PDC with fois gras. By this time we were already stuffed from our previous dishes, but we miraculously still managed to eat. The stuffed PDC is a pigs foot on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with fois gras. Gluttony at its finest. This dish was very indulgent and could have been the only dish we ordered since it was massive, but hey when in Montreal, right? Overall, the meal we had was exceptional and although food came out slower than I expected it gave us a good buffer between the courses. Everything I ate here is a fav in my book and definitely a memory I'll always have of Montreal! Thanks for the fantastic meal Au Pied de Cochon!"

The vibe is casual and welcoming. We were never rushed or made to feel out of place. Our server was incredibly helpful, funny, and patient with five weary Americans. She walked us through and answered questions and directed us without encouraging over ordering. It was probably the richest meal we have had - caviar, foie gras, bone marrow, poutine, red wine, creme brûlée. Each item was perfectly prepared and served, and we rolled out of there with gastronomic memories we talked about for the rest of our week in Canada!"

The maitre' d soon offered a table just inside the door which did not seem like it would be comfortable. After refusing that one and waiting a bit longer, we were awarded a slightly larger table, opposite the bread station. We'd made a bad decision - throughout the meal there we were disturbed by the constant rushing of the servers, with the odd occasional brush against. I began with a Negroni, well made and well priced, but on the small side. Moved on to wine by the glass.  La Portena also had a glass of wine. Although we were practically seated on top of the bread, and had a bird's eye view of the frenetic slicing, we were not offered any.After quite a delay, my appetizer, the Plogue A Champlain ($C31) arrived - lukewarm. The slab of foie gras on top was perfectly cooked, but the base of potato and pancake was heavy, the bacon forgettable, the egg was MIA. La Portena's tripe arrived in a ceramic pot to great fanfare and did not disappoint - the tripes, done in a provencale style, were delicious. The pig's foot was an unexpected surprise. chewy and gelatinous. The problem for her was that the pied du cochon comprised most of the dish - she ordered tripe, she wanted tripe, not trotter. At this point in the meal, we requested bread for sopping. The bread was excellent, and the butter with it was perfect.For a main course, I decided to forgo the duck in a can so we could share the special for two, a massive ""trout."" These were swimming as we arrived. The dish was well worth the long wait - the large fish was coiled around a sort of salad of a dark green lettuce that was unknown to me. From its size and pink color, I suspect le poisson was actually an Arctic char. Perfectly cooked, meaty and swimming in a delicious butter sauce - probably a variation on beurre blanc. The fish redeemed all that gone wrong before it. There was also a light dressing on the salad, and the whole thing worked perfectly.We were quite full and as so much time had passed,  we were in no mood for dessert.So I am a little torn by this restaurant - I believe whole heartedly in the style of eating it supports - but it needs a service upgrade in this writer's opinion. (See review by Howard K.) Still, I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try something else."

To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had.

Then she questioned if I called the wrong restaurant since there is a restaurant in France with the same name? I clearly said no, and showed her my phone record of calling. Then the hostess said ""Sometimes we take reservations and do not write it down"" ????? Not sure how that made any sense to me. Anyways, she then said there are available spots at the bar which was facing the kitchen and can actually see the chefs in action which I don't mind so we sat there. At least we got a spot, or else I would have been pretty pissed since I know this place fills up and you need to make reservations in advance. Regardless, sitting at the bar was an amazing experience seeing all the chefs cook. Reminded me of the movie Burnt.Asparagus & Morel ($22)Boiled Asparagus, Cooked asparagus and morel (a type of fungus), and topped with a slice of Parmigiano cheese. I still can't describe the flavor of this dish, but it was definitely tasty. I've never had morel before, but it had a really spongey texture - quite interesting. Foie Gras Poutine ($24)This poutine was hearty, but definitely amazing! Especially if you like foie gras. There were huge chunks of foie gras, and big chunks of cheese. Their cheese is actually made in house (I saw one of the chefs making cheese, although it could be for the Mozzarella dish, although I would assume they would use the same cheese). The fries were crispy and already flavorful on its own! With the foie gras, cheese, gravy, and a few fries all together in one bite - epic moment right there.Duck in a Can ($44)This was very interesting and creative. Essentially the chefs cook the dish and stuff it into a can. Then, when they serve it, they open the can in front of you and all the deliciousness spills out, served on top of a toasted bread with a layer of squash spread. The squash spread was really good. The duck meat was cooked just right, border line well done. It was delicious, but I do feel the meat could have been slightly more tender - it wasn't as juicy as I'd expect it to be. I really liked the shredded cabbage that was drenched in the sauce, very flavorful.Maple Syrup Creme Brule ($9)This Creme brule was really good, but SUPER sweet! Slightly too sweet for my liking but it tasted good. Really creamy and you can totally taste the maple syrup.The service was good, except for our waitress. This was my disappointment. Everyone but our waitress was super friendly and helpful. Out waitress did not check on us during our meal at all, and not to mention she probably missed our dessert. It wasn't until we sat there with nothing for 20 mins, she then came by acting like nothing happened and said ""oh your dessert still didn't come yet?"". Then I saw her keying something in the computer. We waited a total 45 mins for the Creme Brule! Even though at the end the waitress took the item off our bill to apologize for our long wait, that $9 did not justify the 45 min wait. Not sure if it was just my luck, but I wasn't pleased with the service experience. The food sure was amazing though. Definitely coming back the next time I visit Montreal!"

Nelson Mandela revolutionised South Africa, Michael Jordan shook up Chicago, and here in Canada, we are celebrated by the wild, incredibly talented, and fearless Martin Picard.

I strongly suggest going with your gut feeling, because by the end of the night, you won't be feeling your gut any longer.  Côte de Cochon: So uncomplicated yet so unforgettable. So unassuming yet so unapologetic. My still-to-be-educated mind made the mistake of doubting the pork chops in this establishment, and damn was I humbled. The pork that is so tender and so juicy deserves more credit than my photo is giving it. The real show stopper is having each slice with the jus, that I still yearn for in my pillowy dreams. Canard en Conserve: The pièce de résistance, the bright light in these darkened times, the one amazing dish that can entice the feeling of gluttony, love and fierce loyalty (if that's not obvious enough by now). All the ingredients come together like a symphony on your taste buds. The foie basically melts and fuses with the duck breast. And the jus again does miracles to the meat, imparting smoky sweet bacon, earthy herbs and delicate cabbage with every bite. Also the whole duck-coming-out-of-a-can provides some theatrics for the 'gram, ya know what I mean?It has just been decided that Au Pied De Cochon will set the bar on my Yelp account as the only 5-star rating I will ever give. No review prostitution going on here. Vive le Montréal(Oh, and wear loose clothes)"

It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....Drip Drip DripDinner was really good!!

The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON...

Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood."

Can we talk about the lentils for a moment? Lentils are difficult. It's hard, for me at least, to get that just right consistency of not mushy, firm but not raw.

Chunks of poutine two types of gravy that tastes like you would not believe. If you like foie, it will put you in goose liver heavenPlogue a ChamplainI'm still not sure what all I ate. It was like they put Quebec in a plate and wrapped it in a buckwheat blanket and drowned in, obviously, gravy and maple. Some things that I think I ate: bacon, foie, cheese, egg and l'amour. And a heart attack. Worth it. Salmon RillettesThank goodness for this dish. It was a wonderful palate cleanser as the lightest thing we ate. It would stand alone wonderfully and was probably my second favorite thing the whole meal. For the record: yes, I called it the lightest thing on the menu. Yes. Salmon mixed into an artery busting amount of butter and sour cream/creme fraiche was the lightest thing our entire meal. But this is the type of meal where considering the amount of cream and butter and fat is verboten. MeatloafAmericans, this ain't your grandma's meatloaf (unless your grandma was from Quebec). It was sweet and soft with this almost curry-ish gravy and topped with butter beans. Veal LoinsPerfectly cooked. Excellent flavor. Not the best bite of the meal, but if you served it to me any random day I would be glad to eat it. Another sweet and savory dish. Duck in a Can""Inside (the can) we have half a duck magret. 100 g of foie gras. Cabbage, onions, bacon, thyme and garlic cooked in butter. And a reduction of balsamic vinegar. The magret is cooked sealed with everything else in boiling water for 27 minutes."" Yup. Pork Chop with LegumesHow could we leave without any Cochon?

Oh, you STILL haven't read LifeOnMacro yet? Here: lifeonmacro.com/2015/12/…. You're very welcome.Food: I recommend the catfish fritters for appetizer. I ordered the happy pork chop but my wife ordered the special pasta, which really stood out. It was made with pesto and other sauces, but thereafter, the server put together the dish on top of a huge block of cheese. By adding a bit of hot water, part of the cheese melted into the pasta before it was plated. This was the special of the day and it was absolutely delicious. I was tempted to order the other specials and should have, but did not. I will next time. DO NOT SKIP DESSERT! We had the flaky hot pecan pie a la mode. We have not found a better pecan pie anywhere else, ever. The ice cream was freshly made in the machine behind us!! The price for all this appeared extremely reasonable to me, though I guess everything in New York City is inflated for no good reason.Service: among the greatest I've ever experienced in all of Montreal. The servers all anticipated our needs - the water was continuously refilled and our bread was always plentiful. The server appeared cheerful, too. Relatively rare in Montreal.Americans, please note: dinners in Montreal may take three hours, and that's okay. Per Doctor Elsie W.'s point: just accept the fact that this is the case. Chefs obviously take extreme pride in their cooking, and a perfect product takes time. Please try not to complain about the speed of food service and try to accept this new culture/environment you're in. It's evening time in Montreal, there aren't too many other places to rush off to anyway =).Tip: parking in this area can prove extremely challenging! Good luck!"

We asked the server for a red wine recommendation and were very impressed with the wine he recommended. The bread and butter on the table were good.

We ordered poutine au foie gras, the ham dish on their specials, and the foie gras pasta of the day. The poutine with foie gras was probably my favorite. The crispiness of the potatoes and cheese curds were a great complement to the heavier foie gras and gravy. The ham dish, which featured thinly sliced iberian ham topped with a sweet maple syrup and accompanied by a side of beignets, was also a standout dish for its uniqueness and unexpected combination of flavors. The sweet and savory worked so well together. I was a little bit disappointed with the foie gras pasta. It was very cool to see it being made table side within a giant cheese wheel, but the pasta came out kinda cold. The portion was also very small. The texture of the pasta was tad bit too al dente for my taste. However, the foie gras mixed into the sauce tasted amazing. I think this restaurant is a great value (especially if you're coming from the US) for all the foie gras you get. A must try if you're visiting Montreal.

The duck was very tender and the fois gras was to die for. A huge surprise, were the roasted veggies.

Loved the cromesquis (if you order, wait at least 30 seconds before eating as the inside filling is HOT) as they were juicy and flavorful. Don't want to be inappropriate here, but make sure you eat them in one big bite because the filling bursts in your mouth (please get your mind out of the gutter). The foie gras pizza was great with small chunks of foie that wasn't too heavy and fresh cheese. The poutine was also delicious and we finished the entire plate. The only mild disappointment was the duck in a can. The presentation was unique and memorable, but as a dish I thought it was only okay. It was very heavy and the flavor didn't wow me in any way.

It's been almost a week since I dined there on Duluth Street, but I'm still talking about the evening. I booked reservations a few weeks in advance of my trip, knowing that it was not a place that you can walk into. A few people I met with in Montreal were surprised that I was able to get a seat - until they heard that I had planned ahead. Our waitress was great and provides great advice and recommendations. This place was hyped up and was ready for high expectations. Here's what we ate:Appetizers:Cromesquis Foie Gras - very rich and the right size to pop in your mouth. A nice way to experience foie gras. Poutine Foie Gras - decadent. My dining companion had this as his first poutine. All future poutine will now be disappointing. Smoke Shack Ham - served with lovely little pancakes. This was a delicious meat. Mains:Zampone - a pigs foot stuffed with charcuterie and served with a maple glaze. Very rich. A delicacy which will induce a happy food coma. Duck in a Can - the most underwhelming item we tried. It was not that flavorful and was a bit mushy. Dessert - we were too full.

The weather was nice and the doors were open to the street. The restaurant was crowded but not uncomfortable. The restroom was really hot. It felt like the heat was on in there.

Granted, I shouldn't have stuffed myself with all things fat and cream in one sitting...With that said, everything was really good, though again, really heavy with rich sauces and fat. We even ordered a salad, which didn't help, because there were cubes of fried pork in it. Now I understand why the French drink wine with their food. It definitely helps to cut the heaviness.Cromequis de foie gras (foie gras cromesquis) - Amazing! You let it cool for a bit so you don't burn your mouth, pop it in, bite down, and let the flavors explode. It's awesome. My friend had a bad experience with foie gras because it was grainy and we had to explain that foie is supposed to be smooth. She tried this and was converted.Langue de bison a l'estragon (tarragon bison tongue) - Another amazing app. The tongue is tender and flavors worked in unison. Plus, there were bits of carrots so yay for veggies.Carpaccio de canard (duck carpaccio) - I liked it, but my friends didn't think it stood up next to the other two apps. It was mild in flavor and I didn't care for the cheese shavings on top, but the carpaccio itself with good and fresh.Poutine au foie gras (foie gras poutine) - we ordered a half size because we had a lot of food coming. Fries were good and crunchy and gravy was poured over it. Sitting on top of the gravy was a huge chunk of foie. Overall delicious, but we're glad we didn't order the full serving.Special of the day: Calamari and fries in squid ink sauce - I guess when the server mentioned the special all we heard was calamari and squid ink sauce because we didn't know it came with fries. I think there were more fries than calamari, possibly half and half, and the sauce was decadent and thick. There were also gold flakes sprinkled on top which were pretty cool. Good dish nonetheless, and quite different from what I've experienced at other restaurants.Special of the day: Salad with pork - I forgot what kind of salad the server said this was, but it came with a lot of cubed pork on top of two or three pieces of lettuce and arugula. On the side were two rounds of bread with chevre spread onto it. Probably can skip.Duck in a Can - get this! Sooo good! Don't even ask questions, just do it.Ordered some more dishes... but I don't remember what they were at this point. I need a return visit to remember."

/user_details?userid=hFvLG_m26hYMx1UGQSpaEg,Jo N.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"After looking at all the great reviews. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the foie gras lobe that costed $120. It was either 500g or 600g of foie gras. It takes an hour to make this dish. It consisted of foie gras, ham, bread and berries. I did not like this dish. It was not to my liking. I did not expect this dish to come sweet and fruity. When the waiter said that there was a dessert that came with it. I didn't think that it was going to mixed inside with the foie gras. It was odd, different from the foie gras served at other restaurants. They had delicious bread too. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Presentation wise. The food was not appeal. On the good side, their service was great! The server came by really often to fill water. I may consider coming back to try their other foie gras dishes as they have a wide selection. But the foie gras lobe is totally not worth it. It just didn't taste good to me."

But my experience at this restaurant was particularly BELOW expectation in every way, that I had to write something about it.Me and my partner had a reservation at 8pm and we came in 10 minutes early. No one in the restaurant told us that there was this line just for those with reservations and people kept on trying to cut in because they also had reservations, thinking that this line was for those who just walked in. There was no one to keep people in order and it was just chaos. We were then seated after 30minutes of waiting. Once we ordered our food, we then had to wait an hour and 30 minutes for our first food to come to our table. No waiter ever informed us that our food will take this long, or even just assuring us that our food is on the way. A lot of people around us who were seated after us got their meals way before we did, which was bizzare. It was also really hard to get a hold the waiter. The food was just okay, nothing special.Will never visit this place again, and would deter all of my friends who even show interest of going there."

The restaurant itself is casual and every inch is  utilize for tables. You will feel a bit wedged in once you're seated but won't care once you start to eat! There were three of us in our party and we had the following: - Foie gras poutine which was a nice starter. The gravy was so flavorful, the curds so squeaky and the foie gras was just enough. We were happy the portion was on the smaller side so you don't fill up on fries before the main course. - Duck in a can which is one of their signature dishes. The duck is actually cooked in the can (for a precise 27 minutes) and they open/plate it right at the table. It was rich but delightful!- Foie gras hamburger .... amazing is not a strong enough word... it is beyond good. Incredibly decedent with the venison burger, foie gras, bacon and fixings, this one is not to be missed!- For dessert we got the milkshake XXX (meaning with booze) and the maple creme brûlée to top off our meal.Our experience was excellent from start to finish!"
/user_details?userid=hPNvRl4jAXsYoBAAhudRrA,Scott S.,"Salem, OR",5 star rating,"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a tendency to overcompensate. I have been guilty of pushing myself to run 2-3 times the distance of a missed run day on the next day to ""make up"" for lost time; I once went 300 dollars overbudget on a TV because the exact one I've been saving up for was conveniently sold out the day I went to purchase it; I also drove 300 miles to a brewery to buy a case of beer when I found out that my local distribution wells had just sold out.Foie gras isn't something that I'm known to go nuts about--I've actually only had it once previous to my dining experience at Au Pied de Cochon--but it did bring a slight frown to my face when a state-wide ban on one of the world's three delicacies was instituted a couple years back, depriving me of the oppportunity to ever try it again (at least at my home state)So you can only imagine my delight when I stumbled upon yet another opportunity to overcompensate, when I learned about a restaurant that pretty much drowns everything in the chopped liver of a stuffed goose while conferring with a friend about a possible trip to Montréal; I was also amused when I found out that said restaurant also likes to stuff ducks into cans and serve them atop slices of baguettes, but I'll save that story for later.My Calgarian friend and I ended up at Au Pied de Cochon after making reservations weeks ahead (we tried the same for Joe Beef, but no such luck there.) Once we got to the restaurant, we found ourselves behind a murder of crow-like uppity bachelorette party girls who apparently had been double-booked and waiting for over an hour for the restaurant to accommodate. Whereas this wasn't a great start to the evening, listening to four Indian girls bitch drunkenly about how they think they're better than others and how the restaurant should cater to their every need brought both a chuckle to my face and a glimmering hope that maybe they would shut their annoying pie-holes.Annoyances you would more often than not experience at fancy world-class restaurants aside, we were promptly seated at the bar by the charming hostess who took our orders at the bar while securing our table in the main dining area. While waiting for the food, I ordered APdC's homebrew ale, which never made its way to me, perhaps because our tables were moved or because they forgot, but it didn't bother me too much.For the appetizer, we ordered the evening special which was a seafood gratin of sorts baked into a fluffy eggy batter with just the right amount of cheese. I can still remember every bite of that delicious seafood/vegetable filled fake-pie. What's more, is that I remember my friend trying to cut up and eat the cork wood coaster that the gratin was served on.Next came the Duck Carpaccio -- out of all the thinly sliced meats/fish/vegetables I've tried in my life, this was probably my favorite. The duck was topped with fresh onions and mushrooms, served on top of a dreamy bed of olive oil and a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar.While the main courses were cooking in the back, our Foie Gras Poutine graced the table like an angel descended from heaven -- my friend and I tried a lifetime's worth of poutine during our 3-day excursion in Montréal, but we both agreed that this was quite possibly the most exquisite that we'd had. The way the foie gras gravy mixes with the cheese curdles and the fries.... I have absolutely no words to describe the unholy matrimony of the two.The Stuffed Pied de Cochon was the first of the heavy hitters to land at our table. Think Schweinhaxe meets foie gras, takes her out to romantic first and second dates, and then goes hard and heavy on the third. I never thought I'd ever enjoy eating pig's foot (even though it does appear to be a delicacy in certain regions of my country of heritage), but who can say no when the meat is so tender, juicy, tangy, and tart at the same time? Hell, make anything taste like the aforementioned adjectives, and I'll eat anything -- just don't tell me what it is until I'm done.And finally, our coup de grâce was served to us in the form of a white can with the words ""CANARD EN CONSERVE"" and ungracefully plopped onto a serving plate on top of four finely sliced pieces of baguette. How it landed so perfectly and artfully despite its forceful ejection out of a metal can, I will never know, but one thing is for sure; I have never known life until I've had a perfectly delightful meal served out of a can, and I'm glad that meal took place at Au Pied de Cochon.Probably one of the top three best meals I've had in my life. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in town!"

Maybe the most junior bussers were given the opportunity to be waiters that night. It was like you picked up the staff from a student run cafe and put them in charge. The waiter congratulated himself on how much he could carry. Moments later he dropped a number of plates, a few inches from me. No real apology there. They brought some other table's drink to us. Don't know if they ever got it. We ordered coffee and deserts. Some how the deserts arrived 30+ minutes after the coffees. How long does it take to grab a premaid pie? The waiter forgot to get a signature for the credit card. Then he made a joke about how he could just forge the signature. Dude was in general creepy and not really funny in the way he thinks."

Au Pied de Cochon is famous from its appearance on the Anthony Bourdain hosted No Reservations episode in Quebec. travelchannel.com/tv-sho…My first love here will always be the duck in a can (44.00$) which you can order to go since it'll last 2-3 days if refrigerated. This may very well be the best thing I ever ate that I didn't cook. half a duck breast, 100g of foie gras, mushrooms, half a head of garlic, and vegetables.The Foie gras shots are a winner to start with. Small, simple, superb.The Foie gras 'tout nu' is a very close second. Its simplicity is its strongest suit. Balsamic glazed seared foie gras atop large crustinis.If you want to turn the tout nu on it's head, but with the same flavors, go with the Foie gras hamburger, this massive beast of a burger will leave you with no regrets.The Foie gras Poutine is alright, I feel like they could have done so much more with this dish, same with the terrine. The next time I'm back, I want to try the cured foie gras & boudin tart and the foie gras DuoMy beer recommendations include the Cheval Blanc and Cream Ale. The XXX Milkshake is also a dream, like one of those really willd fantasies that make you keep wanting more.Chef Martin Picard does wonders with meats and foie.

I think I made the reservation 3 weeks in advance on their website.SERVICE 5/5 - Our server was lively and helpful but my one critique was that he talked incredibly fast so we had a difficult time understanding the dish ingredients in combination to the noise in the restaurant. APPETIZER 5/5 - Tartare Temaki: I was really hesitant about this dish but because of my dairy sensitivity, it was the only appetizer that I could consume. Anyway, this was amazing. It was tender, tasty and it had a QUAIL EGG you pour into the temaki. MAIN 5/5 - Duck in a can (onions, cabbage, bacon, thyme, garlic cooked in butter and 100 g of foie gras). This was a memorable dish!!! It was so decadent and pairs perfectly with a glass of red wine. You'll never forget this dish and it's a must try in Montreal.MAIN 5/5 - Pork Chop: wow this was delicious. The sauce was incredible and the pork chop was cooked to perfection! If I come back to this restaurant, I would definitely reorder the pork chop. It gets overshadowed by the novelty of the Duck in a Can and the Stuffed Pied de Cochon w/foie gras. DESSERT 5/5 - Pecan Pie: again, I cannot eat dairy so this was the only dessert I was able to order but let me tell you that this was the BEST pecan pie my partner and I have ever tasted!! Inside was gooey caramel topped with perfectly toasted pecans. The crust = A++++BATHROOM 5/5 - I know.. weird I am commenting on the bathroom after dessert but the toilet seat was heated and bathroom was clean. There's a TV in front of the toilet that shows what's going on in the kitchen (I think). I need to come back to Montreal to have another memorable meal at Au Pied de Cochon!"

/user_details?userid=AEijotPmJL2jYDK0gh_3UA,The Fat Delicious I.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Mecca for Foie GrasWithout a doubt, the world's greatest collection of foie gras preparations are served here. This restaurant was featured by the late and great Anthony Bordain on season 2, episode 4 of No Reservations.(dailymotion.com/video/x2…). After having watched that episode, I arrived with an appetite to experience this restaurant that went beyond that of my palate and stomach. It was meaningful to me that we were sat just behind the counter where Bordain sat during the filming of that episode. I ordered the Foie Gras Poutine. As many have stated, this was the best poutine I've ever had. The foie gras was seared and bite sized allowing for perfectly portioned trio of foie gras, french fries and curds. There was traditional brown gravy but also a decadent lighter colored buttery sauce. As a second app we ordered the Burrata special which came with cherry tomatoes and basil. It was also the best Burrata I've had. So we were two for two. I was really intrigued by the Duck in a Can and needed to experience it. In addition I also tried the Duck Magret. Although the Duck in a Can was an inventive way to prepare and cook that combination of ingredients, it fell short for me. The Duck itself was very tough in texture and definitely had a metallic after taste from the can itself. The foie gras that was included in the can was not seared (my preferred preparation). In addition, the Duck Magret was amazing in comparison so it was hard to continue forward with the Duck in a Can dish with a perfectly prepared medium rare duck breast on the table. It was the duck equivalent of best filet mignon on can have and it was served with a rich brown sauce accompaniment. Let me reiterate that I wasn't unhappy with my Duck in a Can. But I didn't eat much of it and denied the waiter's offer to wrap it up for me to go. To his credit, he wanted to know why I didn't finish it nor wanted to wrap it up and I explained (although that wasn't something I would have mentioned had he not asked). After hearing that, he spoke to the manager who offered us a complimentary dessert. We chose the pecan pie and it was an amazing finale to an amazing overall experience. The service was great. The restaurant is well, if not over, staffed and no less than 6 employees worked my table. This is definitely a must hit."
/user_details?userid=YHr-ijGyWQg3hsP-sEEl4A,Felix L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"APDC is probably the most iconic restaurant in Montreal. It's a contemporary Quebecois restaurant, not French, but considered Quebecois or French-Canadian. The cuisine is extraordinary rich and heavy, perfect for carnivores, and fit as comfort food during cold weather. I couldn't have dined in at a more appropriate time, a day when it was snowing in Montreal during May.A long time customer who I sat next to at the bar told me that the menu got condensed over the years. He said that the food is still solid and decadent though.Sunday is probably the worst day to dine at APDC. It's the end of their week, so many items were sold out. The server named a few special items but was unable to translate it to English so I skipped them. Since the restaurant is known for cooking every single part of a pig, I ordered the ""Happy Pork Chop"". The next item on the menu ""PDC cut"" is basically a double portion for 2 people (over 1 pound of pork). I also ordered the signature cromesquis de foie gras as an appetizer.The cromesquis was like a pork-based croquette molded into a cube. It looked harmless on the outside, but it's lethal inside. The interior, filled with foie gras in creamy and runny form, explodes once the crust penetrates, so be sure to consume it one bite!The roasted pork chop was crispy on the outside but slightly on the dry side. The meat was tender and tasted great with the caramelized onion, button mushroom, and sweet bergundy mushroom gravy. The gravy was full bodied and the dish was very filling.Since I didn't order any large appetizers, I was able to save room for a dessert. I had the pouding chomeur a l'erable, a very classical Quebecois sweet consisting of hot crusty bread pudding drowned with housemade maple syrup. The thick maple syrup was very sweet but served warm and extremely comforting to eat. It was the perfect way to end the meal on a cold night.Being from California, I honestly don't think I would have a craving for the Quebecois food served at APDC. But since the mood and weather was a perfect fit during my visit, I had a terrific 4-star experience.A few tips:1. Make a reservation by email: reservations@restauranta…The restaurant somehow lost my reservation and was about to turn me away, but fortunately I pulled up my reservation confirmed by email and they let me in.2. Best seat is at the counter, not the bar, they're way different. The most you'll see at the bar is a server cleaning glasses.3. The restaurant is loud and cozy. 50% local, 50% tourists during my time of visit."
/user_details?userid=NzlqN1Ca9SW5z780thoiAg,Mel C.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"For my boyfriend and my final dinner in Montreal, we made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon.We were greeted by a friendly waiter and he went through the specials with us (there were a lot of specials). He described the cold lobster soup ($12) so well, I decided to go with it. We also got oysters (6 for $18) because I love raw oysters. Lastly, we had to get au pied de cohon au foie gras ($45). The waiter was nice enough to tell us that hte au pied de cochon will be enough for the two us and that we shouldn't order any other mains. They also offered us freshly baked bread as we waited for our appetizers and main meal.When we got the cold lobster soup, we were surprised because we didn't hear the waiter mentioning that it was cold. It was quite salty and I didn't catch any lobster flavour in the soup at all.When the oysters came, I was super excited until I saw the size of it. It was quite small considering it was $3 a piece. I could get the same size oyster for cheaper ($1 a piece) at Biff's Bistro in Toronto during their happy hour. Nonetheless, the oysters were delicious and the sauce that it came with went wonderfully together.Lastly was our main meal which took 30 minutes of wait time after finishing our appetizers. The meat fell off the pig's foot. The sauce over the mushrooms was so good. The best part was the mashed potato with cheese melted into it. This restaurant really lived up to its hype on this dish.However, our night sadly went downhill because the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We wanted to see the dessert menu to possibly order more food. However, every time we see him, he'll finish talking to another customer and then walk the opposite direction from where we were sitting. Finally, we decided to get the bill. We finally flagged him down and he didn't get back to us at all. From the end of our main meal to trying to get the dessert menu to us trying to get the bill took over 30 minutes. In the end, it was another person (looks like the manger) who got us the bill.I still give this place four stars. Although the waiter completely failed at serving our table, the food was awesome and the price point wasn't too bad."

It's a beloved spot, and there's a reason for it. If you're a first-timer in Montreal, this should definitely be on your dinner list. First, make reservations (we emailed). I can't stress that enough. We made reservations 3 months in advance of our weekend trip to Montreal, and I'm glad we did - we watched throngs of people trying to get in on a Friday night without a reservation and they were turned away.Second, the environment. Bustling, boisterous, lively. Upscale feel but still comfortable and homey. Service was so sweet, not pushy at all, and made the effort to rattle off all 9 specials (by memory) including the price, so we wouldn't have to ask.Third, the food. Rich, comforting, and so delicious. Note that this is a very, very heavy meal, with large, generous portions, so come hungry. We ordered: a) Cromesquis de foie gras (appetizer, $4.00), b) Charcuterie Plate (appetizer, $16.00), c) Beef Rib ($30.00), d) Pork Chop with lentils ($20.00), and e) drinks. Everything was delicious, but the standouts for us were both appetizers and the Beef Rib, which also came with mashed potatoes. So rich, delicious, fell off the bone with the softest way possible. Everything was incredibly tasty, carefully cooked. The charcuterie plate was the best I've ever had, and cured to perfection. What else is there to say that hasn't been said already? I would definitely come back here again, and wholeheartedly recommend it, especially if you're a tourist in Montreal. The place is full of both tourists and locals, and is an atmosphere and meal you'll definitely remember.With tax and tip, the bill came to around $105."

Well, I remembered to go there but immediately forgot about the whole reservation part. However, that didn't stop us from showing up anyhow just to check if maybe we could slide by. Success!! We managed to snag the (apparently) elusive walk-in spot and were elated. The restaurant itself is bright and pretty, and the staff were super friendly and chatty. After a fantastic sparkling rosé suggestion from our server I was pretty much sold, we were feeling so good about getting in on a lark that there was basically no way this could have been a bad experience. We ordered the foie gras poutine (hey, I've never had it and we're in Montreal), dumplings with shrimp, pork and foie gras which were wrapped in squid ink and beet noodles and served with 'dragon sauce' and maple syrup (a real stand out!), and the duck in a can which also had foie gras. (So basically what I'm saying is several geese died for this meal.) Everything was very tasty- a totally satisfying and fun meal- though I can't say it was life changing by any means... it certainly seemed to be more of a seafood place so perhaps had we ordered the more expensive seafood-y stuff it woulda been life changing. Or maybe if I was a bigger fan of foie gras? (Like, it's fine but it doesn't make me do backflips.) But I'm pretty satisfied with it as just a good ol' fashioned stand out meal. We also ordered the maple crème brûlée because Canada- also a lovely choice. All in all, I think I would have been a little more disappointed had I waited months to get this reservation, but as a walk in it was positively delightful. (Maybe that's in part the bragging rights sweetening the deal.)"

If drinks and fat in surplus is what you live for, you will love it here.I was lucky to visit with a friend of the chef so I have no knowledge about making reservations; only that you really need one and they are difficult to get. We sat at 9:30 on a Wednesday evening. It is a cute, small restaurant. Very narrow walking areas and difficult to hear. The music is quite loud. While all this adds to the vibe, I found it frustrating to not be able to understand the waiter or the people next to me at times. Certainly not a ""romantic"" evening spot.That said, the food is delicious, if very excessive. There is so much foie gras on the menu that it becomes shorthand to ""fg"".Overall, I found the food rich, too rich to me. There are no fruits or vegetables anywhere; just protein and fat. (Parsley was the ONLY green thing I saw all night long on a plate.) For some, this is heaven. For me, almost sickening. I love that the chef is true to himself though and doesn't worry about catering to everyone. He makes what he loves and forgets the rest. The wait staff is polite and helpful, explaining many things on the menu and patient with kids or large groups.We tried many, many things. The highlights?Maple soda. I did not see this on the menu but was offered it by the waiter because I passed on the alcohol; it is homemade and amazing! Bubbly, refreshing, not too sweet. The perfect cut against fat.Foie gras poutine - the gravy it out of this world rich and deliciousFoie gras fried bites - I forget the exact spelling but they were perfect piping hot squares of heaven. A MUST orderSeafood dumplings - a special that day; like dim sum with maple syrup on top. Amazing.Seafood platter - we ordered the ""small"" and it was still huge. so many things to try on it. A perfectly cooked octopus which is very difficult.Sugar pie - sweet, custard pie that is really scrumptious!The duck in a can was just okay to me - but I was overloaded by that point. Duck carpaccio was good. Bison tartare hand rolls were interesting with quail egg yolk - looked beautiful.---I would return if someone wished to, but not at the top of my list. It's just not my cup of tea. Everything was cooked well and interesting, I just need more vegetables and fruits.Everyone else in the group was on cloud 9 though, and so for that, I only deduct for the atmosphere, which is too loud to enjoy fully.P.S. Only one bathroom made wait times long, and no temperature control on the water. Washing hands in almost boiling water is so painful and almost made my kid sister cry. Ouch!"

After some discussion he wanted us to come back in for another dinner. I explained to him that we were leaving the next day and that it wouldn't work.

Ask to sit at the bar to watch the kitchen work its magic. I have never seen such a loud, hectic, chaotic environment, it was like watching a food opera with chefs yelling at each other, tossing plates, salting food from across the kitchen, torching deserts, laughing etc. It was amazing, and a highlight of my trip. Despite the madness of how busy it is  they take the time to talk with you and ask to make sure your food is amazing. As a note, the ""pied de cochon"" dish is something suitable for 2 people minimum, so don't go there thinking you can get the two signature entrees for a dinner for 2.

We booked this place 3 months in advance because of how popular this place is and it was worth the wait. The place is not too small & not too big. There's no sign that says you're at APC, so I'd use google maps if you're not a local. We tried several dishes amongst the 7 of us and all of them met or went beyond our expectations. The foie gras pizza & foie gras poutine was a delicious appetizer that got our juices flowing for the entree. The fatty liver literally melts in your mouth. For the entree we shared a Tuna Steak Calamari & Fresh parmesan gnocchi. The gnocchi was prepared in a huge block of fresh parmesan cheese with pesto sauce. Definitely, snapchat/IG worthy. We wanted to try the pig's head but unfortunately they were sold out of it for the day. Other than that, service was phenomenal. Everyone was very attentive and helpful. I also must mention the bathroom, which was also phenomenal since they went all out with purchasing a bidet! A nice little treat for your tushy.

/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",2 star rating,"I came to APDC with an open mind and wallet. I wanted to experience an extremely decadent Quebecois meal. I didn't eat very much the day of. But, I did order fries as a starter. That's a terrible choice. The portions are massive, even from a usually undefeatable appetite as mine. It wasn't the size of the meal (though it was monstrous) as much as the density of the entree that made the mere thought of consuming it repulsive.Foie Cromesquis- I was unimpressed. The exterior was similar to the fried brading on a mozzarella stick. No special flavors to speak of. The inside of this bite-sized app I was hoping would really capture the essence of foie. It did not. The filling tasted mainly like french onion soup with a faint taste of foie. The texture was not particularly rich or decadent at all.Fries- Also unimpressed. I was expecting rich duck fatty deliciousness. Their fries are pretty standard style. Think boardwalk style: deep fried with the skins still on, just slightly thinner. They were OK, but the entire time I was thinking that I could and have made fries of better quality. Nothing special. Stuffed Au Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras-A ridiculously dense gut bomb of pork fattyness served over mashed potatoes with a porky demi-glaze with notes of red wine maybe. The dish was way too much food for me. But I'm fine with that. No harm there. This dish was offensive to my pallete. It literally had large pieces of pork fat and skin in it. The sauce was so dense I wanted to vomit. The flavor profile was so dominated by the taste of fat that I felt like I was spooning up an oil spill. I'd like to see some balance to this dish with acids.The execution of the pork itself was also questionable. The mouthfeel was OK, but it wasn't falling off the bone and flaky like some of the better pork tenderloin, shoulder, and ribs I've enjoyed elsewhere. The Foie Gras was fairly mediocre. Really did not have the same butteriness or depth of flavor that I experienced the night before from Chef Sakurai at Toroli. The service at APDC was excellent and all the staff were friendly and attentive. It was a fun environment with hip music and smiling people. I'll probably come back at some point to give a few of the other dishes of Au Pied a try. But I won't expect as much as I did this time."
/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,"Au Pied de Cochon is a restaurant founded by Chef Martin Picard back in '01, offering some new Canadian comfort fare.  The menu revolves mostly around the different parts of the pig, such as the pickled tongue, boudin, tarts, pork chops, pig's head, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras, etc.  I made advanced reservations, and the hubs and I came here for a later dinner after we landed in Montreal.  We started off with the Fg Poutine, which was a plate of freshly-fried fries, topped with a lovely foie gras sauce, cheese curds, and generous chunks of foie gras - this was decadent, but not too heavy, and the gravy was super delicious.  For the main meals, we tried one of their specials, the Croque Monisuer with roasted pork loin and French toasts with maple syrup - we were not fans of this, as it just had too much going on; I wasn't a fan of the pork and the taste of it, as well as the oversweetness from the maple syrup-drenched toasts.  We then tried the Hot Chicken - this was pretty tasty, as the chicken itself was cooked perfectly and was super juicy; the salty crispy skin exterior had tons of flavor, and I loved the thick nice au jous-type of gravy that was drenching everything - I'm a huge peas fan, so the fact that there was an overabundance of this just made my heart happy!  For dessert, we tried the Milkshake with PDC Maple Toffee (one of the best milkshakes I've had, this wasn't too thick and easily drinkable - the taste was a mixture of funnel cake/creme brulee and something just magical - not overly sweet, but decadent enough), and the Maple Poudding Chomeur (love little bread pudding that had a yummy crunchy exterior, the hubs was a total fan of this!).  I'd love to go back and try out their Happy Pork Chop (which they were out, sadly), as well as their Duck in a Can.  Service was super friendly and attentive, as Gregoire and Louis were both fabulous.  We even received multiple complimentary bread (that had a lovely crust to it - rustic and yummy, it was great with the soft butter that was served).  The place is open late and it does get packed - reservations are highly recommended.+yummy complimentary crusty bread :D+Foie Gras Poutine :D+Hot Chicken :D+Milkshake with PDC Maple Toffee :D+Maple Poudding Chomeur :D+ask for Gregoire and Louis :D+friendly staff+reservations highly recommended!"

Make sure to call weeks ahead for dinner reservations to secure a table. My friend and I winged it and walked-in hoping something was open and sure enough, they had two seats at the bar. We were stoked as we saw the view in front of us. We had the best seats in the house! It's an open kitchen with the entire crew sans Chef Martin Picard, working within an arm's reach. We got to see all the action, interacted with the chefs, and witnessed all the dishes before they got served to all the tables. How awesome is that?We were off to a slow start with our server being so busy with other tables but he got us started with our beers and gave us enough time to figure out what to get. It was a struggle as everything on the menu sounded so decadent. Being from California, the banning of foie gras has made me craving for it. This place has foie in almost all their dishes. Imagine my excitement! Here's what we ended up getting which my dear friend and I all shared:FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS ($3.50) or croquettes if you will. It's filled with foie gras jus oozing out as you bite into the crisp, deep-fried breading. It was really just a bite to tease us for what's next to come. Then came the GUINEA HEN LIVER MOUSSE ($8). A jar filled to the brim with the mousse accompanied by some orange marmalade and sauerkraut on the side to complement each other. This proved too enticing for me to resist wiping out completely. Ask for extra toast if you run out or use the table bread which by the way, was also hard not to indulge in. Warm, crusty, and fresh from the oven.A special of the evening was their MOULES FRITES ($10). This was not on the menu but we saw lots of these coming out of the kitchen and we just had to order it. For an appetizer, the serving was hefty. The sauce, wow, buttery with bacon bits and a hint of white wine. It was addicting and to dip the bread in it was inevitable until all the white creamy liquid was no more. We had quite a pause until our main course came. We welcomed it and watched the live show in front of us, oohhh'ing and ahhhh'ing as we saw beautiful plates of pig heads, pied de cochons, foie poutines, meatloafs, and ducks in a can pass right in our faces. Finally, the star of the show, STUFFED PIED DE COCHON WITH FOIE GRAS ($45) was laid in front of us. It was ginormous! We were planning on getting an order each initially but bless Chef Audrey's heart for letting us know this was a meal a family can consume. The pig's feet was nicely breaded and laid atop a bed of super creamy mashed potatoes, covered with a stew of mushrooms and onions, then topped with perfectly seared foie gras. Rich, decadent, and seasoned without any apprehension, Chef Martin depicts his true colors on this one amazing plate. Needless to say, the other half had to be packed and eaten the next day. We left completely satiated by the ""in your face"" flavors on every plate and thankful for the crew that was fun and pleasant. Capping off our Montreal trip at Au Pied de Cochon could not have been any better. Merci beaucoup!"

Must try!It has been few years since I visited the actual restaurant and my memories of it were kind of blurry. The foie gras poutine of the food truck brought back immediately the flavours of that dinner. The size of the poutine is decent for a food truck as well as the size of the foie gras in it. What makes the dish unique is the foie gras gravy, it is just delicious. We also shared le verrat à l'érable, battered pork sausage soaked in maple, which was really good and filling.

These two factors alone I would rate Au Pied de Cochon very highly. In regards to the food we ordered - we had the Foie Gras Nigiri, Duck Carpaccio and Stuffed PDC & Foie Gras. Each dish, more amazing then the previous - the highlight of my night was the Foie Gras Nigiri. You wouldn't think foie gras as a nigiri would work, but it does. The richness of the foie gras with the sushi rice and sauce made it a delicious bite, which I never wanted to end. The Stuffed PDC & Foie Gras was also really delicious - it's definitely not something two people can finish. I'd recommend ordering it if you had a bigger party.The problem of the night for us, was the service we received. When we were ordering, we were told that the 'Duck in a Can' was completely sold out for the night. Though it was what I had really wanted to try, I did not push any further. You can imagine my annoyance in seeing a 'Duck in a Can' come out of the kitchen and being served to the Francophone non POC couple that were seated and had ordered after us. Of course the couple could have put one on hold when making their reservations, but I had overheard their conversation as they were ordering - I can assure you they had not. To top it off, I was already peeved because I had waited 45 minutes between ordering and my first course arriving. Meanwhile the server had not dropped by to let us know why there was such a long wait or to check-in in general. Though I did observe him sneaking in sips of wine and beer behind the coat 'rack' quite a few times.All this added up to being a very unsatisfying experience at such a highly recommended restaurant.

If I ever came back, I'd def go with a huge party so I can try everything without feeling guilty. Every dish is so rich so you definitely need to share! I'm so glad I got to try this place! It's definitely worth the hype! I'd skip out on the foie gras poutine unless you had a huge group to share because poutine is so rich already, you have foie gras on top of it so it's a bit overload. Tartare temaki is my favorite! It was horse tartare with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed shaped cone. Anyways, if you're in montreal, do yourself a favor and go here!!"

/user_details?userid=jyGzKoSIs-AStRX3NItM0Q,Neechi M.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Summary: Delicious food but overall experience left something to be desired. When making a reservation ask not to be seated next to the cellar if you get cold easily!Food tip: PDC's Melting Pot is the best we tried on our table (vs. The fried chicken, oysters and pork chops that other members of our party ordered). The Melting Pot was literally a small pot with a bunch of different porks (pork flank, blood sausage and some others I don't recall) that seemed to be slow cooked and then laid on a bed of the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. This was a seriously good meal. The pork chops were a close second but I with someone on our table had tried the PDC's Cut because I suspect that would have been delicious.Atmosphere: The interior is very nice despite the single bathroom that means there will be a consistent line of anxious people waiting to use the bathroom if you sit by the cellar in the back and it is busy. The seating up front by the window looked like a nicer place to be in the summer. It was also cold by the cellar because they kept leaving the door open very long when going in there. Drinks: Lovely as well but not sure how the bartender did not know what either a French 75 or a Moscow Mule were despite having a full bar and no cocktail menu (i.e. you'd expect they know some classic drinks). I ended up having a simple Hendricks tonic with cucumber and it was perfect. I also like that they bring the tonic/soda water in a separate little beaker.One negative: The declined to give us the wifi password because the owner ""does not like people being on their phones"". Except this was only a problem for tourists because most people were locals and we're using their phones in the restaurant!"

Good experience but I think for health reasons, I will avoid next time. Haha. The best was the blood pasta - soaked in chicken broth. It was divine!

/user_details?userid=m-Pnm53eK4NFW6keiL7yjQ,Donny T.,"Truth or Consequences, NM",3 star rating,"Let me begin this review by saying that this is a very special restaurant and that there's some marvelous cooking happening here. I'll also say that the fact that it has four stars and not closer to five is also telling how it borders on novelty (and given all of the attention it's gotten in the media, that's not a huge surprise). I imagine we weren't the only tourists there...Several years ago I drove up here from upstate NY and had the duck in a can, which was terrific, and no pretense of overeating, and left feeling warm and comforted. Two years ago I came with a group and we got the pigs head (for two!) This was one of the most decadent offerings I've seen anywhere (with a lobster stuffed into the head of a pig fried in duck fat...) We all took part, and our eastern European friend, who had zero fear or inhibitions about eating *all* of the animal gleefully consumed the brains, eyes, snout, etc... It was the summer and everything was great.Fast forward to last March when I visited with B and way over-ordered on the advice of the server. Everything seemed overdone--a level of fat (and I know that's what we're there for) that simply overpowered us. We got the eponymous pig's foot, which was mostly a gelatinous case filled with leg fat surrounded by goopy, somehow stringy cheese mashed-potatoes. All of the appetizers were, on the other hand, over-seasoned--too salty (the tripe), or too sweet (the salmon head). Dessert was nice--I got the maple syrup pie, which tastes like the real deal (amber best grade!) She got the burnt bread ice-cream, which was unremarkable aside from its name...The service was unfortunately C+. It was a busy night, but we waited fifteen minutes to order dessert and another ten just to get the check. They were, at least, very friendly and accommodated us quickly when we pointed out a mistake on the tab.And so I wish I could give APdC 3.5 stars. I'm not sure if I'll go back after this, but for those of you not tl;dr yet, here's the pro-tip for two:Order one entree to splitOrder two appetizers: one ""exotic"" the other a saladEnjoy the excellent bread but don't eat it all!Share a dessertYou'll be absolutely stuffed, but not regretting it all the next day as we were."
/user_details?userid=dnHvmhmUgO2eLn-oJZdQbA,Erica L.,"Columbia Heights, Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I've been itching to come here for years to try its porky and foie deliciousness.  It did not disappoint.  Our table of four chowed down on the following:  -Tarragon beef tongue with spicy mustard carrots and pickles. Tender and sumptuous. Definitely one of my favorites of the night. - Veal liver with veal tartar above over a bed of mashed potatoes and a veal gravy. One of the best but potent liver dishes I've had. - Poutine with fries cooked in duck fat, gravy, mozzarella cheese curds, and foie gras. The foie was just perfectly smooth and delicious. - boudin tart so a blood sausage tart covered in more foie gras. I enjoyed this a lot. - Lightly battered pork rectum (yes, really) in a homemade General Tso sauce, and beet and  roasted beets, and a light salad. It was surprisingly delicious though the first bite was fairly funky. The fresh orange juice and campari slushy was also delicious.  I will say that I felt like I was made out of foie gras and could feel it pulsing through my pores all night.  What a rich and divine meal!  It's fairly small inside and strangely laid out.  When we first entered, it felt like we'd walked in the back entrance and I felt certain we'd come in the wrong way.  It's laid out like a long railcar with the bar/kitchen along one side.  The bathroom's inside the kitchen, which is a bit bizarre.  It's so tight that whenever the waiters came by to bring us water or dishes, they almost had to dance on one leg to bring it over.  But it's warm and inviting and the service was friendly.  Unlike other commenters, I didn't feel like we ordered too much or were pressured to order more.  Our waiter told us we'd ordered just the right amount."

However after a while, it got tired and too salty for my liking.  As for the foie gras poutine, I was not a fan of it at all.  Too heavy and rich for me.  I know that's the purpose of this restaurant, but I couldn't even have 4-5 bites. On the bright side though, is that it was reasonably priced as both dishes were under $8.50.Verdict: If you like greasy, salty food, you'll like it.  If you don't and prefer your food a bit less adventurous, then I wouldn't recommend."

Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?!But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: dailymotion.com/.../xo2k…...).Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up! All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one. And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticonAll this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'.

/user_details?userid=HQbCgPEfQFZy8luXlnhUcw,Christian W.,"West Covina, CA",5 star rating,"Wow! This restaurant deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it. Service: Very great. Staff was very attentive, friendly, and welcoming. There were 3 different servers tending to us (I think because it was a very busy night, and servers were covering multiple tables), but it didn't feel like they were overwhelming us with questions if we needed anything, or in any way intrusive. Food: Foie Gras Burger - thick burger. Doesn't come with any sides...just the burger. Coming in at a hefty price of $39 bucks, I wouldn't know if it was worth it. The foie gras slice is decent amount, but I probably wouldn't order it again. But don't worry, it's a pretty big burger so you'll leave full. Pigs feet stuffed with foie gras - this was really really really worth it! Definitely something to share with one or two friends. The pig feet actually came with mashed potatoes on sides and there was a little mushroom/rosemary/carrot/gravy moat around the giant pig feet 'castle'. A couple slices of foie gras were on top of the pigs foot. Honestly, there wasn't as much foie gras in this entree as I though...but the sheer amount of pigs foot definitely made up for it! Final thoughts: Takes about 30 min to bring out the pigs foot. There was a little hiccup in the cooking process which tacked on bout 20 min more BUT the restaurant was nice enough and considerate enough to bring out a complimentary dish of ravioli and artichoke hearts so I could eat with my other friends together since their burgers came out earlier. Very considerate and definitely enjoyed it. I would come back in a heartbeat. Definitely a cute place to bring a date. Just make sure it's not the first date, cuz you'll be setting the bar real high. Wallet was noticeably lighter after this meal!"
/user_details?userid=tjTrsF-CpDnTcclX-3sCTw,Al L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Probably not much has been left unsaid about Au Pied de Cochon. Its one of the heaviest, most indulgent meals I've ever had. It is beyond rich and fatty. But the food does live up to the hype. Started off with coppa and bread, which may be one of the best charcuterie plates I've had. Also got the duck in a can, which was pretty good. Very rich, but very flavorful. Only knock on it is that the fat on the duck is not rendered off enough, which made it super fatty. I enjoy fatty/rich/decadent foods but this was too fatty even for me. I also tried the foie burger, which was as delicious and artery clogging as I expected. The desserts are just okay. Or maybe my heart had already stopped and I couldn't enjoy it as much. The restaurant is loud inside and they play a lot of loud rock music, which wasn't the vibe I was expecting. My main knock in this restaurant, which is why I didn't give it a 5 (because the food is definitely a 5) is the service. The service is spotty. I had specifically reserved 4 seats at the bar (so I could see how the kitchen works), but they had given that up to someone else. So I we got seated at a table. When I arrived, they said the people at the bar were getting their check and wrapping up, but as I walked by, the people at the bar were just getting started. No one else got seated between the time I arrived and when I got seated, so something does not smell right. The waitress we had was not nice and did not want to explain anything on the menu for us. She seemed very dismissive and gave off a ""you should know this, if you're eating here"" vibe. Not helpful at all.  We also asked for our bill on 3 different occasions and still didn't get it. It took about 20 minutes for us to get the bill. Very disappointing service."
/user_details?userid=dsmZN2E8CRSdlTaFUPZM3g,Joseph C.,"Vallejo, CA",1 star rating,"It sucks having to write this because the food was delicious - however, service is also important. The evening started out great to be honest, we were there for my 30th bday celebrations and had heard nothing but the best going in.  It all seemed amazing because we ended up going an hour early and landed seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen (basically all up in the kitchen).  To be clear, our server was excellent.  Had great recommendations, was very pleasant, and strived to make the evening great for us. We had amazing dishes, and I will give the restaurant that. However, as I mentioned, we were basically in the kitchen.  We had to sit through preparations of our meals and appetizers (and also those of every other patron) and it was a really fun time, until this one person. There was one staff member in that kitchen, a female with very short hair and tattoos on her arms.  Frankly, she is the reason for this 1-star review and should probably not have a job at such a great restaurant.When the time came to order dessert, we ordered a crème brûlée and then the waiter's note about it being a birthday dessert clearly went through.  The staff member immediately started complaining, including a very, very loud ""wow, can't people just pay for their desserts? This is so stupid"" -- so a few things here: we were paying for our dessert; was it really so painful for you to pull a sparkler out of a cabinet, put it on a pre-made dessert and shut up; do you not realize that people can hear you, and who the hell cares? Now the answer to the third question - yes.  Yes, she did realize that people could hear her because she AGAIN loudly said ""OH GREAT. They couldn't at least tell me they're sitting right in front of me? Now I look like a fucking asshole."" No argument here - yes, yes you did look like an asshole. She then continued by pointing in our direction to another sous chef and saying ""it's them right there, and they could totally hear me that whole time.  And they're looking at me."" One - paranoia. I have an extremely short fuse and normally would blow up.  However, I chose to turn a blind eye to her nonsense that night and tried to ignore it and have a good time. Now any other person with any semblance of a clue, or any understanding of natural social cues would have realized how uncomfortable their obnoxiously loud voice and comments were making her colleagues.  No, not this one.  She just kept going.  Loudly complained about having to put sugar and burn it with a blowtorch (yes, she burned the dessert) on the dessert (OH YOU POOR THING - you work too hard). Now this seems like I'm harping on this one person, and let me be clear - I am.  She deserves it.  I have worked in the service industry and crap like that would have never flown for me in the restaurants we worked in. At the end, I bluntly told the server that she was excellent and made our night great.  But that sous chef in the kitchen ruined it. She shot a nasty glance over at the woman and indicated to us that she wasn't surprised, and this wasn't isolated behavior. She did her best to make things up for us, but we wanted to leave. We paid the bill and bounced.  To that sous chef, thanks for ruining a birthday dinner. I hope it was worth you looking like a ""fucking asshole"" that night."

But this wasn't a meal I could enjoy without suspending my taste for balance in a meal. Service was super slow, though at least they did acknowledge this numerous times. The server was very friendly and helpful. We started with the tomato tart and pork/shrimp/foie gras dumplings... These were the highlight of the meal. The foie gras melts on the dumplings, very decadent. I realized, however, that there's was nothing to cut the richness. Before my palette could recover, our mains came out (the ""melting pot"" and the pork chop with mashed potatoes)... They were delicious for a few bites, but I got overwhelmed by the rich, fatty, smoky, salty flavors. Maybe I just didn't know how committed PDC is to bring all about those things, but it made for what I thought was an incomplete and difficult-to-enjoy meal. Even some fancy housemade pickles or radishes or *something* would have made a big difference. I am probably in the minority here, since the place was nonetheless packed. Don't get me wrong - excellent food - but I wouldn't return. There are so many good menus in this city that I don't think I need the spectacle of PDX."
/user_details?userid=mV5Ey139Bj2coaSPTKXBCA,Barbara S.,"Mill Valley, CA",2 star rating,"This is a generous two star review. We really wanted to like this restaurantFirst the positive:My husband is a huge fan of pork. Our starter gets five stars... It was the one and only thing we liked. It was an appetizer of thinly sliced housemade prosciutto served side-by-side with amazingly delicious fried pancakes floating in maple syrup. A bite of both together was over the moon. If we'd stopped there this would be a whole different review.Also of note: our server was very nice and patient when we asked a lot of questions.Now the gross yucky inedibles:I really hated the poutine. What is everybody raving about with this dish? French fries that were actually OK on their own smothered in run-of-the-mill gravy and  cheese curds. It's not that I have anything completely against fat, but if it doesn't taste good why bother?Next came our entrées:Mine was a hamburger with foie gras. I'm used to the United States kind where it's a pate and it's all blended together without any look of the organ that it once was. I didn't realize this was going to be the whole organ itself, so maybe it's my bad that I didn't know what I was in for. The bun of the hamburger was deliciously buttery but with all the other food we had eaten it just became overkill with fat upon fat upon fat. I ordered my burger medium and it came out medium rare: red and squishy and lacked the nice chew I am used to in a burger. My husband's entree was a blood pudding tart with foie gras. He generally loves this dish and when I asked him what he ranked it on a 1 to 10 he gave it 2. Now for our dessert:We shared a maple pudding for an unemployed person. There was nothing about it that made me want to have a second bite. It was overly sweet, and the texture wasn't good enough to bother eating. In my book it was just gross. If you look at my other reviews you will likely notice that most of them are four and five stars, so this is a real departure for me.A man who may have been the manager came to our table at the end of our meal and asked if everything was OK. I told him my experience of it and he said something to the effect that maybe I should've had a different dessert. He didn't offer anything, and our tab with the tip was $200.In defense of this restaurant, the people at the next table shared prime rib of beef for two. It looked absolutely fabulous and was served with mashed potatoes. I was also curious about the lobster. So maybe if you're going to this restaurant and you're thinking about getting some lobster or prime rib you'll have a whole different experience. Good luck if you go"

I stopped by the bathroom before I ordered from the menu and literally my mouth was agape at all of the dishes on people's tables. If you think the same was as my sister and I did, you will want to get the pied du cochon dish - I mean, it seems to be the namesake of the restaurant! But, beware, it is probably the most food I have ever gotten ever. If there's just two of you, I would suggest only getting this dish. there's a ridiculously large and meat filled pig's leg with mashed potatoes underneath laced with cheese and tons of gravy. And, the bread is really delicious so you can get tons of that if you want. The food is so rich that I was almost sick afterwards, so if you don't want that happening for you, take my advice and order on the smaller side."

What was cool about this was that they cooked it in front of you on a thick slab of cheese. They first put the pasta into the cheese slab, put hot water,  then put the bolognese sauce on, and then the foie gras. As they plated it, the scraped a lot of cheese off...so you get a very cheesy dish, literally.Overall, everything was very tasty.

It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town.

The service was excellent and the atmosphere of the restaurant made the experience that much better. I'll be going back the next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=l3Mn_QlHhv8duCKOTZuKdQ,Candi H.,"Chatham-Kent, Canada",5 star rating,We highly recommend eating here if you are able to get a table. If possible make a reservation well in advance. The space is small & lively and the service was excellent. Our meal was so deliciously rich and satisfying. The bison tartare temaki was my favourite thing of the meal and actually of our entire weekend in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",5 star rating,"Most of what's been said about this place being proudly gluttonous is spot on. If you can embrace it for what it is, you're sure to enjoy it. This is a celebration of meat, and organ meat, and fat, and foie gras, and more meat-and the amazing things they create with them. This isn't delicate, subtle French dining. This is an unabashed, indulgent carnivore celebration. There wasn't a bad thing we tried. A tuna tartare appetizer was fantastic, as was the Duck Carpaccio. Poutine Foie Gras was a thing to behold. Probably the best poutine I've had, but it was too much for 2 people to split, IMO. You have to really love Foie Gras, but if you do, it's incredibly generous in that dish for the price, and it's melt-in-your-mouth tender (the way it should be).Service was very good as well."
/user_details?userid=n_ImbsmVH-P3Zq7Zp3qU0A,Matthew L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The food is heavy. That is the most standout description i can think of. One does not need foie gras on everything. If you make it into a sashimi with rice ok that is innovative and blends the fatty taste of foie gras with the light sweet taste of rice seasoned with soy sauce and spiced with a touch of wasabi. If it is put on something like a pig leg then it adds fat to the already fat and heavy pigs leg. The drinks are really good. IIRC there is a maple beer. I haven't tried everything yet and with restaurants like this the menu items are really hit or miss.
/user_details?userid=ukp5bUGNcvl2OWU5CPG7fw,Teresa H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"One word: WOWThis place was packed even when we arrived for our reservation for 10pm. We were quickly seated and based on reviews here, I knew I wanted to order duck in a can for sure, not just for the concept but for the food as well. Our server who is very knowledgeable about the food here recommended that we share two dishes because anything more than that is more than enough. And he was right!We ended up ordering duck in a can - $44 and Plogue à Champlain - $29, and two glasses of chardonnay - $10.Both of these two dishes have small amounts of fois gras, if you are a first timer try not to order dishes with a lot of fois gras in them. Eating a bit of it is okay, but I find that if you're eating a lot of it, you'll end up getting sick of it after.The duck in a can is a cool concept, the chef makes the duck, then seals it in a can where the server will come to your table, open the can and pour out the food on a plate for you. The reason why it's put in a can is because it's to seal all the flavours. The duck is very flavourful, not dry at all. Best dish I've had. And the Plogue à Champlain is something I've never had before, the taste is very unique and different. It is ""a small mound of buckwheat pancake, layered with melted cheese, roasted fingerling potatoes, bacon, all topped with a slab of seared foie gras and drizzled with maple syrup--heaven"". Service was fine, I found that they took care of big groups around us much more which I can understand. Anyways, it was a pricey dinner but well worth it!"

I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion. On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite. Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss."

/user_details?userid=u140UcK66QZWCWTpawz5Pg,Amy B.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"After having been to the PDC Cabane à Sucre twice in the last 5 years, I've been meaning to eat at the actual PDC restaurant in Montreal for a while now (last 5 years, to be precise). But it took this long... and unfortunately, my experience fell way short of expectations. My partner had been in with a different set of people previously, and he loved it (he had the pork chop). He excitedly told me afterward that he had found this amazing restaurant he just had to take me to, only to realize that it was the exact same restaurant he'd been rejecting  every time I brought it up in the last 3 years. To remedy his faux pas, we made a date to go there for a special occasion last week.Our reservation was for 5:30PM, and despite being early, we were seated promptly. Service was ok, although we may have irritated our server from asking too many questions (we were concerned about portions, because we weren't super hungry when we arrived...). The menu had a lot of items in it, but surprisingly not a lot of cochon (unless you wanted the stuffed PDC, which we didn't). My partner was pretty disappointed that the pork chop (or some variation) was not on the menu.In the end, we got the foie gras poutine to start and one of the specials for our main: halibut for two. Yes, I know - why halibut in a restaurant famed for pig & foie? Well to be honest, they made a mean fish when we went to their multi-course sugar shack last year... so we were really hoping for a repeat of that perfectly cooked dish!I also had the maple gin and tonic to drink, which is just as tasty as I remember (from the sugar shack). The poutine was pretty good - the foie gras adds a richness to an otherwise ordinary dish.The disappointment lay solely on the halibut. The lentil stew with leek and mushroom was delicious enough; but the halibut was way too salty! I have a pretty high tolerance for salt, so it was an unpleasant surprise to admit that the fish was salty to the point of inedible. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so we paid before I made the comment to the server. Which of course was just met with a sorry, you should have said something sooner (and maybe we could have replaced your food). Not sure if that was good enough, but whatever. For a restaurant that charges a premium for their dishes, I expected a lot more. In the end, our business was already lost.. I just hoped that my comment may have prevented an unpleasant experience for other guests that made the wrong order.We likely won't be going back anytime soon... if at all."

/user_details?userid=bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,Thea V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So I tried booking a reservation at the restaurant in the beginning of January. I called several times and every time they heard me speak English they hung up. So I tried calling again and spoke French this time and they finally took my reservation for the 12th of February at 8pm. We arrived a couple of minutes late because of the terrible snowstorm. We already checked out the menu online so we were ready to order as soon as we got there. We wanted to order the hamburger with foie gras and pdc farci (stuffed pig's feet) and the pig's head. It took a while to get our server's attention and the place was not even packed. As soon as we mentioned our orders, the server told us that they do not have any of them available for tonight. My partner and I were very disappointed but I convinced him to stay because might as well... the snowstorm was pretty bad and we did not feel like driving anywhere else. We ended up ordering the foie gras cromesquis for appetizer and we got the plogue à champlain and the pig's feet with mashed potatoes for the main course. And for dessert, I ordered the earl grey ice cream and the pouding chômeur. FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS- Delish! The interior was  a very rich liquid foie gras and the outside was quite crunchy.PLOGUE À CHAMPLAIN- a slice of potato underneath topped with maple flavoured bacon and foie gras. The bacon was probably the best bacon I have ever had, it was juicy, tender and tasty. The foie gras was delicious, it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.PIG's FEET WITH MASHED POTATOES- the pig's feet was good but not amazing. The meat was really tender and juicy and it was sitting in some kind of brown gravy(kinda reminds me of poutine gravy). The mashed potatoes were the best part of the meal !!! Best mashed potatoes ever ! They mixed it with mozzarella cheese and it tasted just like poutine with the gravy but mashed version , omg ! I would definitely go back just for the mashed potatoes.EARL GREY ICE CREAM- good but nothing special. They put maple syrup on top which kind of made the top a little sour.POUDING CHÔMEUR- Delish! Extremely sweet and warm. I always love a good pouding chômeur. Overall, I was disappointed that they did not have everything on the menu , the service was not the best but the food was pretty good. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon though. I recently tried the Cabane à sucre and I personally think it's a much better deal."

I was a broke student so I decided to come here with friend and order one main dish, one appetizer. Then the price wouldn't be so bad.Ok let's see.... I really wanted the foie gras poutine but the waiter came over to tell me Pain De Veau was the daily special! Damn it I can't afford two mains!! Well whatever I guess I'll just have to return.Pain de veau is a French dish and it's basically veal bread. Something I never heard of! At Au Pied de Cochon they made this with red wine, a lot of veal, some roquette leaves on top, AND FOIE GRAS. Of course FG. I'm not missing out.It's VERY flavourful, in fact really strong. It's extremely good! For the appetizer we ordered duck carpaccio $14, which is raw duck, mushrooms, cheese, egg yolk, dots of colours (sauces). And you mix all this together. It tasted more sour than duck which, to be honest, is usually what westerners do: cover up raw stuff with sour stuff. So you're tasting just the sauce. I would pass if this doesn't interest you. I personally would order something else next time.I think in total it was just $34 + tax and tips.SERVICE!Extremely good!!! I fell in love with the other waiter, not ours. Ours was amazing too. Please don't be jealous, hear me out. The other guy was just freaking nice and alive!!!! I think he works in the back (I sat near the door) and he brings food to the table. He doesn't take customer orders, he brings food from kitchen to table. But because the restaurant is ALWAYS so busy, he naturally helps out everything! Water. Changing tables. Checking up. Are we ok?? Napkins? Coming ASAP!!The only awful staff is the coat lady who's at the front of the door and she takes in new customers.

I mean, how can your mouth not water at the sound of foie gras poutine?! The possibilities here are endless, and trust me, they have a ton of good stuff here!We started off with a couple of drinks (some beers and a few specials each night) and ordered the following: cromesquis de foie gras, crab salad, temaki de bison, poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can.I can honestly say, each one was amazing and we overindulged. The cromesquis was the perfect bite, the crab salad was fresh and delightful, the temaki melt in your mouth tender, and the poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can were all that I dreamed of and more! To be honest though, the stuffed pied de cochon and duck in a can are both heavy in taste and the flavors started to meld together after a while, but they are both still delicious. The presentation of the duck in a can was unique, and the tender pork of the pied de cochon topped with fatty melty foie gras was unbeatable. The stuffed pied de cochon is a large portion, so keep that in mind - it was a little too much food for my family!

/user_details?userid=rEmo4D_qdlKQz7egfnUeJQ,Reggie S.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"This place came highly recommended by a foodie friend so it's been on my Montreal to-do list.  I would recommend making reservations at least two weeks in advanced if you'd like to have dinner at a reasonable time. Twice I've made the mistake of not making reservations ahead of time and was left with the choice of having dinner at 5pm or 11pm. You'd likely be hard pressed to find seating as a walk in, don't even try if you're more than 2 people. They do not do online reservations so my recommendation would be to see if your hotel or credit card concierge can make the reservation for you if you're visiting from the States. The place is incredibly lively and space is at a premium. Everyone, from staff to patrons, seemed to be having a great time.The food did live up to the expectations, I'll admit, but with some rather significant missteps. The food is rich, hardy, and will likely lull you into a post-dinner stupor afterwards. We shared the fois gras poutine as an appetizer which was excellent. The duck magret in mushroom sauce was also perfectly done. Although, if I could do it again I likely would have chosen the Duck in a Can which seemed to be a favorite. The Happy Pork Chop looked amazing when I saw it being brought to a neighboring table so I decided I would order it. Unfortunately, mine was raw in the center and I had to send i back to the kitchen. For dessert we had the Milkshake XXX, which has maple liquer, and the Choco Pie. Both of which were great ways to cap off an already rich meal. Sadly, our service was quite poor that evening. Our waiter was consistently disappearing to other tables despite the fact he would literally pass us whenever he went to the kitchen. We were left to piecemeal our service by flagging down other staff for help because he rarely would return to check up on us. Had to ask someone else for more sparkling water and had to ask another waiter just for bread. At the end of the meal we literally had to point out there was an available credit card machine because our waiter was ready to do another disappearing act as soon as he left the check at our table."

Don't get me wrong, their signature dish is amazing - it's a great pig out! So much that I had to yelp ""get that away please "" when the waiting staff asked whether I'm done with it! Starters are on the small side, but given how big their mains are, it all make sense. Maybe a better portion control is needed! Also their wine is amazing, reminded me of some of the vintage I had in France..."

We went there for my birthday dinner and had very high expectations. My friends are not very adventurous and I've been trying not to eat meat at all. I was going to make an exception for this meal. First of all the restaurant is very busy and very loud. As an aside, floor is extremely slippery so I wouldn't recommend wearing high heels. We had a couple of appetizers but it then took 40 mins after that to get our main dishes. At that point we were not hungry anymore and wanted leave as the server did not come by to refill our drinks or apologize for the long wait. We were sitting there with no drinks or food for a very long time It was a bit much so we felt we needed to speak to the manager who was extremely nice and apologetic. He brought a bottle of champagne and was able to smooth things over. Our food finally arrived and my ham with maple syrup, mashed potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes was excellent. At the end of our meal the manager brought a couple of desserts. Food was excellent but service needs to be a bit better. I think if the server would have been a bit more attentive and not just ignored us the experience would have been much better. I've been a server before so know how it can be with a busy kitchen."

Don't be surprised to find foie gras as the main highlight on the menu, they don't kid with that. Not for the faint of heart - you've been warned. Our waiter was extremely helpful and hectic, in a good way. He always had a smile on. He actually forgot a coffee order from our table but made it complimentary. The duck carpaccio was marvelous. There's something extremely satisfying about breaking the egg yolk and spreading all the yellow yumminess over the raw slices of duck. You're chewing on the delicate duck and then POP, a salty jolt runs through your mouth. The salt crystals were really a nice touch. With an adventurous mindset, I've also had the bison tongue. It's kind of hard not to think that you're actually French kissing a bison. With that aside, the tongue was tender and exceptional. For my main, I had the famous duck in a can. The blob of food that came out of the can was very good. The gravy where the duck was bathing was rich and flavorful. The duck itself was a bit on the tougher side but it was enjoyable regardless. Now, I highly recommend getting a reservation. I witnessed a couple beg the manager for a table. They even said that it was their last day in Montreal. Unfortunately they weren't given have the chance to try APdC."

/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is. Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming. table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup. The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me ""do you want me to take it to the chef to try it"", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more. Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning."

Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day. Between my friend and I, we ordered:- cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it. - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture. - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night. - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me. We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out.

/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)Duck in a Can: Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purée. The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!PDC Melting Pot:We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions. There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the ""buttery potato cheese"", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!"

As hectic and busy as it can get (see for yourself) you will NEVER be left unattended, the waiters know the menu like the back of their hand- ingredients, taste, suggestions; they know it all.  The restaurant is self-explanatory. This is not a diet-meal restaurant, you come here to feast. Pricing is not inexpensive but fair and to be expected for quality food.As an entrée, we had the ""tuna cake tartar"" which was a seasonal special not indicated in the menu. It was good, not great. If you are Oriental or often eat sushi, don't order this. Basically this is a layered ""cake"". First layer was a crispy dough/rice cake, then the rice and topped off with the tuna and beets. We then had the foie gras poutine, probably worth the buck and worth to try in my opinion; this is not your typical poutine dish but more on the gourmet and adventurous side. So you have your typical fries and cheese curd then comes the white sauce which is a foie gras based gravy with slices of foie gras on the poutine. Last but not least we ended up having the seasonal special (not on the menu) steamed tuna  with vegetable and foie gras for forty something dollar- not out of this world but quality is there.The verdict is, the customer service is excellent; if I had my own business that's how I would want my team to be. In terms of food, if it's your first time this is quite an experience but I don't think I would come back any time soon."

/user_details?userid=ev8Ud6HhPzbyOYXrkDP6AA,Kevin T.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"All I can say is wow. Martin Picard really crafted a masterful menu that embodies the Montreal spirit. It transports you into a dimly lit cabin in the mountains. The neo rustic style of cooking really shines through from dishes such a duck in a can to a whole head of pig. They start you off with a made from scratch baguette, that has a insane crust. The crackle it makes when you break into it to the fluffy interior made it easily top 5 pieces of bread I've eaten. They serve it with fresh regional butter. Next, the foie gras poutine. The most iconic dish of Montreal. It might as well be on the flag right next to the fleur de lis. Then combined with gently sautéed foie gras to maintain that rich, creaminess. BOOM. Taste buds have just been assaulted. The chicken gravy is thick and the cheese curds have that squeaky snap that we all look for. I proceeded to think it was a great idea to order an entire pig's head next. Apparently, it had a lobster in it's mouth too. Some artistic ish. Despite the presentation, the meat was tender and the skin was crispy. If I had to guess, they roasted it. They also took the lobster tail, and made a soup. Wasn't too much a fan of the soup as it was really salty. Brain with liquid lemon butter on a crostini was next and it did not disappoint. The creamy texture was very pleasant with slightly tart butter. The tongue was so broken down that it would just break apart when poking with a fork. DeliciousAlso, they brew their own beer"

The restaurant smelled a bit stale, and their A/C was dripping. Their prices were expensive considering that it felt like a casual ambiance. Between the 4 of us, we shared a bison tail appie (7/10, nothing special, tastes like ox tail); foie gras poutine (7/10, nice and rich gravy, but curds weren't the best and the foie gras was just sort of there); Duck in a Can (7.5/10, neat concept, nice flavours, too greasy); pied de cochon hot pot (7/10, decent, nothing special about flavours); a beef steak with pasta dish (5/10; way too much salt and wine!); maple creme brulee (6.5/10, too sweet and texture was like pudding); pecan tart with ice cream (7/10; standard tasting, crust was a bit overbaked).In short, try it only if you're so curious, or if don't mind paying $$$ for salty food drenched in duck fat. ;)"

Definitely recommend you guys try this place, and you will love it so much!!!My friends and I went there for dinner during our traveling in Montreal this July. One of my friends has made the reservation a couple of days before our arrival, and this restaurant is always very crowded. When we left there around 11:30 p.m., there were still several people waiting for seats.This is a French bistro. The wooden interior decoration and a large liquor cabinet as the background creates a bright, sweet, and warm dining atmosphere. You will want to take a drink and enjoy a fun night unconsciously. Every dish looked very home-made, and in a large size, especially the main courses. We have tried the foie-gras terrine as the appetizer. The maple syrup sauce was really a big surprise, not to mention the rich and creamy foie-gras itself with the crunchy bread. We also tried the wine boiled pork shank with risotto. It tasted soooo great!! You could feel the soft and rich pork melt in your mouth, and your lips become a little sticky. The bacon topping brought another different texture as well. I personally really really love this course, it feels like I was in my grandmother's kitchen.The other main dish we ordered was baked pork shank with foie-gras and mashed potato. The crispy pork skin, the mushrooms, the creamy potato, and the foie-gras matched each other very well. They all together helped me to feel different layers of this course. Although the sauce was a little bit salty, I still feel that I could forget all the troubles just because I had this meal.The house special alcoholic drink (made by sake) was smooth. And the dessert drink (maple milkshake) made a happy ending for this dinner, though it was too sweet for me.We got nice service, and the server almost could answer any question we had about the restaurant and the dishes. We also saw other tables ordered charcuterie, and the server sliced a large ham in front of us. That was really cool, and I would like to try that next time.Considering the price, the food quality, the service, and the dining environment, this place is worth to try and come back again!!!!"

We had the foie gras poutine, duck magret and side of vegetables. The table next to us had their duck magret with sauce on the side, I feel like we should have followed as the sauce was too sweet with the mountain of caramelized onion that overwhelmed the mushrooms in the sauce and the perfectly cooked duck. The vegetable was asparagus, charred and seasoned to perfection, but the cheese on top is total overkill and did nothing. Once the asparagus and the duck got cold (we sat by the window on a hot June evening), the cheese slide right off in a gross lump and the sweet of the duck sauce became unbearable.

He made our evening that much more fun and made sure we ordered the right dishes and, perhaps more impressively, the right amount. Instead of just encouraging us to get as much as possible, he actually told us to scale back.Understatement of the year: We ate a LOT. Little cubes of fried, melt-in-your-mouth foie gras.

I tried to learn French for this trip but was to shy to try because I was afraid to mess up. So when I asked the waitress if she spoke English she said of course and took amazing care of us. The food was fantastic.  I think the charcuterie board was my favorite part. Everything about our experience there was great.

Ok, because that evening ex-Premier of Quebec Jean Charest walked in with his family and favorite bodyguards and sat on the table to our right. It was the height of the student protests and I guess the twittersphere must have been active that night. Within 20 minutes the restaurant was surrounded with angst-filled unfulfilled twenty-somethings banging on the walls and windows of the cozy restaurant. That said, my friends and I were far too involved with the pig's head to care. Get the pig's head."

We ordered the naked foie gras, the an exceptional tartare with quail egg (don't eat the shell!), and of course, the duck in a can which (..not to spoil the surprise..) comes with foie!

With exceptional food comes exceptional cost and if you're up for it this place is worth it. Tucked on a side street among other cool little shops and eateries, this restaurant has a great vibe from the moment you walk in. Staff is attentive and fun. Menu consists of just about everything to quench the taste buds of your inner carnivore. Fois Gras has its own place on the menu and is front and centre to the dining experience. We had a bunch of little apps and some bigger ones too and then gave in to the temptation of 90 day aged Wagyu steak. The sauces that accompany the dishes will have you using your finger as a spatula to get out every last bit. If you have room or even if you don't, order the sugar pie for dessert.

/user_details?userid=lv5TnHGfrSb_CIisOw0irg,Jay K.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Upon learning that Au Pied de Cochon likes to inject foie gras into everything from poutine to pancakes, I knew I had to give these people some business.One of my friends scored us reservations at the bar which adjoins an entirely open kitchen where Chef Martin Picard and his capable cadre of culinary alchemists created their inimitable dishes mere feet away from us.Picard is hands-on and oversees or participates in every aspect of the food preparation, all while getting wasted in plain view of his customers. Watching Picard chug an Irish Car Bomb, two glasses of wine, and three pints of beer in the two hours I was there was unreal. By the time I left, the dude's body was rocking back and forth and one of his eyes was permanently closed. It was awesome, they should give him a reality TV show.I began the meal with the bison tongue appetizer, tender strips of meat prepared with tarragon. The meat itself was sweet and had a powerful and distinct flavor.My dining partner ordered the venison tartare, which she let me taste. Nicely seasoned with capers, shallots, lemon, and a hint of capsicum, it was probably the most delicate and lean of all of the food that I sampled.My entrée, however, was a unique and innovative achievement of culinary gluttony -- ""Canard en Conserve,"" or ""Duck in a Can."" Duck in a Can is half a duck magret with a hunk of foie gras tucked under the skin, buttered cabbage, bacon, roasted garlic, two sprigs of thyme, and venison demi-glace, sealed and cooked in a can.The can was opened by the server in front of me and dumped over toast covered with celery root puree. Yes, it tastes as insane and rich as it sounds.My duck magret was not the only tantalizing piece of meat at Au Pied de Cochon; prep-cook Emily's derriere thrilled as she calmly executed Picard's grand scheme -- such a full, wonderfully shaped backside for a white woman that I slurred on about it ad nauseum, even as my friend's eyes rolled each time I did so.Emily and all of the kitchen staff were friendly, occasionally stopping in-between chopping vegetables to ask how we were enjoying our meals, or to answer our questions about dishes they were working on.The only negative thing I can say about this place is its lack of quality single-malt scotch, but this appears to be a systemic problem throughout Montréal. I happily settled with a Macallan 18, which went well with the Pouding Chômeur dessert, literally translated as a poor man's pudding. This resembled a bread pudding made with a maple syrup custard and sponge cake.I look forward to returning to Au Pied de Cochon on future visits to the city. I'd recommend this experience to anyone who loves food, and would also suggest that you try to score a bar seat reservation so you can watch Chef Picard get piss drunk in front of you."

Please don't get fooled by the hype.We were on time for our reservation and the Maitre'd wasn't even around for a good 5 minutes which was alright. We were able to get to our table by 910pm.By 922pm we were ready to be assisted. Our waitress wasn't the usual who would talk to you and recommend anything. I had to ask if they had any specials, recommendations, etc. They served baguette which was good. So we were happy and thought ok this will be a good night. Lol. What we ordered: shrimp temaki (specials), French onion soup, Foie Gras hamburger and Côte de cochon heureux (pork), maple creme brûlée & specialty coffee (had maple alcohol)So the appetizers started arriving around 15 minutes so that's 9.40pm. After 50 minutes of waiting for the main course!!! The food came out... This time we were already getting annoyed. The shrimp temaki: was only good because of the nori, it lacked a bit of zing to it... I'm pretty used to eating Japanese. So I just wished they made it more flavorful and refreshing (cool in the mouth) and a little bit of wasabi too. In the end of the temaki had bacon bits which was not good. The French onion soup: lacks the onion taste and onion and just had beef in it.  Foie Gras hamburger: this one the Foie gras was good! The patty and buns... Don't waste your calories. It was a bit cold too they let it stay out for awhile now.Côte de cochon heureux (pork): over cooked. Dry. Cold. I had to let them take it back. Which the waitress did and said they'll send me a new one. I then decided that I was too full to eat it. I talked to the manager/owner telling him I wanted to cancel the order already and told him the reason why. We ended the night with our coffee and dessert. Then our waitress said the pork isn't going to be charged and we get a free dessert. That's why I'm even giving a 1 star to this review (if I didn't need to it would have been a zero)Even the creme brûlée took so long to be sent out. The waitress gave us our bill. When we got our dessert it was so cold already!! Creme brûlée isn't supposed to be served cold. I just cannot. What a way to celebrate our first night in Montreal. Never going back to this restaurant. Service isn't so great as well."
/user_details?userid=G45p3odftGYzPRkFfCWhVQ,Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",5 star rating,"Indulgent Monstrosities. That is what you are paying to battle in Au Pied de Cochon. Huge portions of delicious delicious beasts imaginatively cooked, outrageously decadent, and quite often topped with foie gras. This is a popular destination so be prepared to make a reservation (via email or phone) at the very least a month in advance. Make sure to confirm my reservation the night or the day of via email/phone. I failed to confirm my reservation the first time I came here and when we showed up our name was not on the list. Luckily we didn't wait long to be seated.The interior is casual and cool;  with a accordion windowed doors in the front that opens in the summer and hanging pendant lights with Edison bulbs. The layout is a little weird and somewhat cramped. The bathrooms are at the end of the bar/ kitchen area. If you're seated in the front, it is an odyssey to dodge and duck your way to the bathroom. Service each time was friendly and quick despite a crowded night.The food is amazing. Luxuriously rich and served in gluttonous amounts. You need to be a rotund competitive eater to be able to eat everything.-Duck Carpaccio 14It looks like art and it tastes fantastic. Drizzled with olive oil and the yolks of some unknown fowl, each bite is unctuous goodness. -Foie Gras Poutine  24This is probably my favorite poutine dish. Creamy rich fattiness over crisp fries. You just have to order this.-Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras 45This could probably feed 3 to 4 people comfortably. Its pigs foot cooked til the skin is delightful crisp, covered with creamy sauce, over some wonderful mash of potato married with cheese. All crowned with an obscenely huge chunk of foie gras.-Duck in a Can  44I ordered this the first time I came here. It is an experience you should have when you're in Montreal. The duck breast with foie gras is cooked in the can. The meat basically cooks in this rich fatty bath. They open the can at the table and dump the contents on a plate of some creamy puree. It is incredibly rich. Be careful not to order too much if you plan on ordering this.-If it appears on the menu again get the Foie gras Tout Nu. Heavenly morsels that melt in your mouth with this dark thick sauce that makes your taste bud sing. This was my first taste of foie gras and it was an experience.-My husband got Horse tartare the last time we were here. It was a humongous portion and came with crispy a yummy fries. The horse tartare was seasoned beautifully. It had a nice heat and was so flavorful.Drinks are great. I had a bourbon cocktail with maple syrup ($12) and my husband got the cream ale ($6).Despite already coming here twice and despite there being so many other places I would like to visit in Montreal, it would be hard for me to resist the temptation of coming here.  Fight the urge to order everything. It is a great experience to dine so sinfully."

/user_details?userid=9c78BQvePaidikiIAjW93Q,David C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"Au Pied de Cochon is bad, and it's bad in a disingenuous way that is insidious and upsetting. It simultaneously wants to be upscale and populist - Poutine, but with foie gras! Lobster rolls, but with foie gras! Chicken nuggets, but with foie gras and maple syrup! A fun-house restaurant like this could be excused for the many, many lapses in service, quality, and good taste. However, the prices and officious service make it very clear that this is a ""serious"" restaurant and demands to be judged as such. I won't complain too much about the overbearing wine service, as it was the only time in the multi-hour meal where any server seemed to remember that their job was to serve. I hesitate to even refer to the men and women in matching shirts as servers, since they seemed to spend the evening engaged in some kind of Olympic qualifying event involving running, shouting, and breaking dishes.Before I document the numerous outrages of the service, perhaps we should discuss the food? Perhaps you're wondering what the titular and famed Au Pied de Cochon (pig's foot) stuffed with foie gras tastes like? I also wonder - it was out by the time we were seated, and our dilatory waitress (the first of many) deigned to stop by -- approximately 30 minutes later. The pig's head for two was also out. And the crab. And tartare. That eliminated roughly 40% of the menu, and essentially all the things for which APdC is known. One can't help but wonder why a restaurant would have a 9:00 seating if all the food is gone. The waitress tried to upsell us on some specials , including a gnocci made in a hallowed-out wheel of parmesan, the cart for which was rushed around by frantic waiters through the evening. Unfortunately, my dining companion's chair was inconveniently situated in the dining area, and often in the way of this cart. My friend spent his dinner being jockeyed aside by the harried server. When we needed time to consider what food to order, our waitress (#1) disappeared for another 30 minutes - undoubtedly to give us time to peruse the remaining 8 menu items. This was interrupted only by the first appearance of the wine steward who informed us that the bottle we ordered was out.When our waitress finally reappeared (my companions and I now having grown beards and birthed children, who in turn had given us many grandchildren, bringing joy and delight into our lives), I was heavily sold on the PDC Melting Pot--it was a ""staff favorite"". No sooner had I ordered it then I was informed it, too, was out. Here's what we ended up managing to order from the apparently empty kitchen:* Foie Gras Cromesquis - foie gras croquettes with a liquefied center, imagine a hybrid croquette and Xaio Ling Bao with foie gras. These were very good. * Duck Carpaccio - doesn't need description. Tasty if unremarkable. * Chicken Nuggets with Foie Gras - Well-seasoned, deep fried boneless chicken with foie gras with maple syrup on the side. Also good. Foie gras added nothing, though.If the meal ended there I would consider this a good if unremarkable restaurant with atrocious service. Unfortunately, we made the error of moving to main courses. I ordered the ""famous""(?) pork chop and my companions had the famous Duck in a Can, but of which resembled unappetizing brown mush. Both the duck and the pork chop were tough and somehow bland. Did I mention both came in a thin brown sauce that slopped around the plate? I should have, as our waitress (#3) nearly spilled all of it on my shirt when she tossed it on the table. Thanks to the long waits between seeing a server, we were spared ordering dessert, which undoubtedly they would have been out of anyway. Once the bill arrived, we finally had attentive service -- the wine steward somehow noticed a bottle was left off our bill within seconds and snatched it away to inflate the final invoice. It was the first sign of efficiency, competence, or haste the entire evening, unfortunately coming at our expense.The final insult arrived after we'd paid the bill when the maître 'd arrived to ask how everything was. One of my companions added that we'd had water dripping on us all evening (true). The captain 1) denied all knowledge, 2) basically claimed it wasn't happening, and then said he would 3) look into it once we pointed out the water drops clustered on the ceiling above. ""In all my 7 years,"" the captain mused, ""I've never seen that happen."" Strange, as an hour before we'd seen one of his staff come out and wipe the ceiling with a cloth on a pole, made obviously for this specific problem. I mentioned before that I think this type of food and service is bad and insidious. Dining like this tricks people into thinking this is what ""fancy"" or ""upscale"" food is like - worse versions of things they eat cheaply (poutine, chicken nuggets) served with a sneer. Like all that is pretentious, it is a strange combination of sickening, embarrassing to watch, and infuriating. This is a must-avoid."

This place was the best dining experience I have had in a very long time!We are visiting from California. I was dying for foie gras because we don't have it anymore in California. We asked our concierge for a reservation. He called said all they had was 9:30pm. A little late for dinner but I was excited just to go. Every restaurant on the street was slow except this one. Completely packed with people. We go in and all they have is a spot at the bar. My boyfriend and I didn't mind and followed the hostess down the hallway dodging the servers who are running back and forth. This place is chaotic and loud in the best sort of way. Our bartender/server was named Jerrome. He was the best bartender I have ever met. He was exciting and fun. He made our Experience incredible. He was knowledgable and entertaining. He was from France and such a happy guy. You could tell he found so much joy in his job. We ordered the poutine fries with foie gras. I don't think you should come here and not have them. They are incredible. Then we had the melting pot which has different kinds of porks. It also come with mashed potatoes. Lastly we had duck in can. Omg that was the best thing we have ever had. I was a little scared when it actually came in a can and they opened it right in front of us. They literally dump all the goodness on top of a toasted bread and cauliflower purée. This also comes with foie so you can't lose. The wine by the glass is a little pricy. We ordered the Pinot Noir which was $17 per glass. It was worth the price because it was smooth and wonderful! I don't think we stopped smiling once. I highly recommend siting at the bar. If your someone who is looking for a normal fine dining experience I wouldn't come here. This isn't a white table cloth stuffy kinda place. This is a place to enjoy amazing rich food and have an experience like no other. I will miss Montreal for this place alone.

The restaurant atmosphere and service was fantastic. The food was good, really good.. although I admit I may have walked in with overly high expectations. To start, I ordered the Cromesquis de Foie Gras which came with two bite-sized pieces. The batter was perfectly crispy with the foie gras filling a smooth creamy texture. My initial thoughts were that the size was smaller than expected, however after eating the entire piece in one bite as per what the server suggested, I realized it was the perfect size. Anything larger and the filling to batter ratio would have been offset. Then came our foie gras poutine. This dish was all sorts of goodness. There was definitely a generous serving of foie gras in this dish and it tasted really good but I feel that some acidity to cut the fat would have made the flavours more balanced. Each bite was super creamy and salty (not a bad thing at all) but after half the poutine I felt that I needed a week-long cleanse. Totally worth it though. The last dish that we ordered was of course the Duck in a Can. I appreciate the innovation behind this dish as I have not heard nor seen a dish that is even remotely similar to this technique. The waiter explained that the ingredients are all cooked inside of the can for 40 minutes. Pretty cool. The contents of the can was then poured over a crispy crostini with carrot purée. I loved crostini as it added more texture to the dish. However I felt that was flavour of the broth/sauce in which the duck was cooked in quite one-dimensional. It reminded me of a stew with a bunch of different ingredients and soggy vegetables. This is not a bad thing, in fact the overall dish was quite yummy but I can't say it met my expectations especially after hearing so many people rave about this dish. I felt that the fat on the duck breast needed to be rendered down a lot more and I ended up just avoiding the skin all together. Portion wise, it was the perfect amount of food for a main course if shared with another person. Overall I found that this restaurant was a good experience and would recommend it to those looking for innovative dishes and a unique dining experience. I am curious about what else they offer and will definitely be returning."

We come here every time we visit beautiful Montreal.Get yourselves the duck in a can with the PDC mashed potatoes and vegetables side for a complete and delectably rich meal. Don't forget to wash it down with a Griffon brown ale!P.S. The above meal I suggested can, and SHOULD, be shared between a couple."

We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty. Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer. Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk. Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purée. The meat was tender and succulent.The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!"

Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm.We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle.Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue.Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...).Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me.The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory.The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy."

Awesome!We also had some tasty beers and the fish and chips with the duck fat frites - the fish was perfectly cooked and very tender and the fries were great as well.  I can't forget to mention that our server was exceptional and took great care of us also.Overall a great experience - next time we will definitely have to try more fois!!!"

I saw that Au Pied de Cochon was the #1 restaurant on Yelp in Montreal. I figured well that's a must! First off, we tried to make reservations via phone for several days during various times (e.g., before 5pm, after 5pm, after 7pm, after 10pm) and we left voice messages. We still couldn't get in touch with them to make a reservation. We came in on a Saturday early evening around 5:30. Luckily, there were seats at the bar with no wait. Although the restaurant was empty, all the tables were reserved. They did fill up quickly as the night went on. I experienced such wonderful and fun service at the bar that I'm so happy we were never able to make reservations! The bartender offered us a drink, samples of his cocktails, samples of garnishes (i.e., ground cherry, toffee chips)! It was also fun to see him make his cocktails with his wide smile and sense of humor! Really made the whole experience a lot of fun!Food: In my opinion, it was just OK. A bit salty. Nothing spectacular. Poutine with foie gras: definitely my favorite dish; foie gras was delicious and the whole dish just went well togetherMelting pot pork dish: a mixture of different cuts of pork; pretty tasty; came with mashed potatoes as wellA replacement duck dish for a sold out menu dish was too salty. I don't remember the name but it was duck wrapped in some kind of pasta/crepe covered with mushroom sauce. I wasn't a fan. Beefsteak: pretty good, but nothing special. came with fries dipped in duck fat which didn't taste any different from regular fries.I think my experience here wasn't as great as other yelpers because there were a lot of dishes that they no longer served or were out of. IDK...maybe we should have gotten the duck in a can???! Oh well.. at least the poutine was good.."

There's a whole section in the menu dedicated to just foie gras dishes! Do try the foie gras poutine as a starter to share for $23 or better yet, get the ""foie gras duo"" for $51 which is a bison burger and foie gras and balsamic reduction and a half order of the foie gras poutine. Extremely decadent duo but great if you want some burger and fries and a whole lot of foie gras!The duck in a can $43 is another must and yes, the dish comes out of a can that is opened in front of you. It comes with a duck breast with 100 grams foie gras, balsamic reduction, buttered cabbage, roasted garlic and thyme. Extremely rich but worth trying. The duck was extremely tender. The whole dish is very brown with more brown so it's hard to see what you're eating. Service is extremely prompt and friendly with lots of knowledge on the food and wine. Bathroom is located at the back and one behind the bar counter (weird spot). Not a fan of the soap they use....hate actual bar soap in public places as it feels pretty nasty especially this bar of soap as it was one of those natural soaps with lots of tree branches and such embedded in it. ew.

It is seriously the most delicious thing ever! Yeah people will gawk, I dunno why, but they do- let them! Its so flavorful, the skin is very crispy, the meat tender and full of flavor, and if your an adventurous eater- everything is good! The tongue, the brain, (the eyes if you wanna get all Bizarre Foods Ala Andrew Zimmern- we did, lol) everything on it is absolutely delicious! Should be good for 2 people, or 3 if you don't eat much.Have also had the stuffed pied de cochon w/ foie gras and foie gras hamburger.  Both are very good and flavorful! Fyi, I cannot understand the reviews that complain about the food being heavy...where did you think you were eating?? lol. The food is heavy, it is rich, it is delicious! If thats what your going for- come here. The vegans expecting a light dinner, um don't? lol.Also, the service is super great. I remember a couple visits ago I dropped my butter knife, I saw a waiter approach me so I turned my head, in a matter of seconds of dropping that thing, one waiter replaced my knife and another picked the one I dropped off the floor!! I was like :O :O :O what is this crazy attentive service I am experiencing?? So awesome! All the peeps that have served us there have been very friendly, on top of service, given full descriptions of what we're interested in ordering, just fantastic!Also, really love the vibe, its loud and fun, love the open kitchen, gives you something to look at.

We were 3 persons , waited in line to get seated ( reservation is a must especially at night) , the waitress was very pleasant and professional helped us get our selection in order. We shared the bison temaki, the salad and bison tongue all tasty and very well presented. I took the foie gras burger, what a taste !! simply delicious but gigantic . One of my friends took the Duck in a Can ; definitely my pick for next visit. We shared different selection of deserts , my favourite was the tarte au sucre. Wine selection is good but prices are on the higher end;  with such a culinary experience a good wine or a beer will complement the dishes.

The dishes are extremely rich, but everything we ordered was fantastic. We split the foie gras cromesquis and white ham appetizers; we are big charcuterie people and the ham with browned butter was decadent. The cromesquis was a great little taste of foie gras for us as we don't frequently eat it; it's so rich. For entrees, he had the veal chop and I had the duck in a can. My food was fantastic aside from the 100g foie gras I struggled to finish! The veal chop was delicious but a bit salty. The playing of the food is lovely and everything is so complimentary - vegetables, sauces etc. but it is rich. For dessert we split the maple creme brûlée, which was incredible. The house beer was a great compliment to the meal, and we also ordered a cappucino at dessert that was served with a tiny carafe of real maple syrup. The homemade bread is delicious. We had a very nice table facing the kitchen, and loved the atmosphere - it's a nicer restaurant but not stuffy at all. Overall this was a splurge (both in terms of money and waistlines!) but a really unique and lovely experience."

I had the Ploque a Champlain which was an appetizer that i had as my main course. It was buckwheat pancake, ham, cheese, foie gras drizzled with maple syrup. I was very disappointed as it was coyingly sweet for me. It was drowning in sweet sauce and the pancake soaked even more of the sweet syrup. I had to ask for a separate plate to transfer my food away from the pool of sauce. Looking back I should've complained. My husband had the halibut with scallops which was good but also drowning in sauce. We had a drink each and no dessert and our bill with tip was around $150. The experience wasn't great for me that night....there was too much noise... servers rushed here and there. It felt chaotic even with a few diners at the beginning of service."

The grilled asparagus was perfectly cooked but there was some stringiness that made cutting though it a bit of a sport. This caused a bit of a structural failure that made eating the sandwich a fun and messy affair. The poutine was too salty for my taste, there being even a bit of salt burn on the tongue. The foie gras on the poutine however was a brilliant and soft counterpoint to the saltiness, as was the hyper-sweetened soft drink. The Oreilles de Crisse were light and crunchy so texturally they were fun but again it was another experience in ""too much"". Deep fried fat will tend to do that.I don't know if I want to fall asleep or just curl up in a corner and have myself a heart attack. 4 stars. Would do this again."

The truck itself is pretty cute with 2 pick-up counters - one for sweets and one for savoury food. Because the weather was a little poor, there was virtually no lineup. I ordered a beignet with haddock and homemade tartar sauce inside for $7. The beignet itself was definitely very cool and just something different, but the tartar sauce wasn't impressive and had a bit too much onions in it, for my liking. The sandwich itself was very juicy and well portioned - a good size (and good price) for a lunch. I'd probably stick to some of their more well-known dishes, for example the foie gras poutine or their sweets as a safer option."

My husband and I kicked off our mini moon at Au Pied with a 9pm ressie. You should make a res, they seat as right away.  Service was very polite and helpful - we ordered the house beer (good) and a Pinot noir like French wines. Everything is french, including the wines so I had to get used to some unfamiliar names. But we had great service and recommendations all the way.We ordered the ham plate (plain) to start which has a yummy maple glaze atop, came with yummy french bread.  Definitely order this. We moved onto the pig foot for a main - this was really good. It was fatty, and fried but meaty at the same time.  The base sauce for so much of French Canadian food is like a beefy, brown French onion soup - and that was kind of what this was like.  Came with hearty vegetables, and mashed potato. We also had the famous duck in a can. I'm sorry to say but I didn't love this, I guess we also don't love foie gras and everything about the foie here is one big slab. It's Better I feel when simmered into a sauce. Anyway, while the cooking technique of sous vide duck breast with hearty vegetables and potato in a can is fun to watch and interested, can't say I loved the taste. The duck was rare though and done on point.We had a side of duck fat fries which were just ok. Didn't taste much of the duck fat but hey fries were always good. We were too full for dessert but looks like they do some good milkshake and ice cream. Definitely can't miss it when dining in Montreal, it's a staple.

So he had high standard when it comes to fine food. After the dinner, he simply said ""amazing"" and that what it meant happiness to him.For me, I ordered ""duck in a can"" and IT WAS AN ART. Very creative dish, from the way it was prepared, cooked, and served to the way it tastes. Simply amazing dish. I also had the squid ink poutine for the appetizer and that was yummy as well, although not as unique as the duck in a can (well, not many dishes in the world would be that unique anyways).If I'm going to rate this restaurant based on the Michelin star standards for the food quality (yeah and I mean the food quality only, screw the formality criteria), this place would be ""4"" stars.One advice when you go there though:  if you are not going in a big group, sit at the bar.

Having made a reservation weeks in advance, we were disappointed to find our table stuck in the furthest darkest back corner of the restaurant underneath a freezing cold air vent. To start we ordered a charcuterie plate which was delicious with thin cuts of house-cured meats spectacularly draped over a pig's skull but the rest of the meal was kinda lousy. I ordered the infamous duck in a can with foie gras, thyme, and cabbage. The duck was tough, the foie gras gelatinous, and the overall dish just a one-note fat-flavoured slop. My boyfriend ordered the foie gras burger which he described as being just a very regular burger, the best thing about it being the in-season tomatoes on top. Our server also goaded him into getting an order of fries to accompany an already mammoth meal that no one ended up eating. My parents both ordered seasonal specials which they both enjoyed, but not enough to justify the price tag. Beyond that my Dad's dish arrived a good 10 minutes after everyone else's which made for a brief bit of awkwardness as we started our meal. What was supposed to be the one fancy night out for my out-of-town parents ended up being a bit of a bummer. It feels like with all the fame that the restaurant has received they've become a bit uninspired when it comes to churning out their greatest hits but put more effort into their specials that allow for less gimmick and more culinary creativity. As predicted, I did end up waddling home with a full belly but ended up totally disappointed and would not recommend Au Pied de Cochon."

The food was pretty good but definitely a little on the rich side. We had the foie poutine (delicious) as well as the buckwheat pancake with bacon/foie/maple syrup appetizer which was also delicious. Folks at my table went with the special tuna which was pretty good. I went with the duck in a can. I dunno if I was foie'd out at that point but it was a bit too rich and not quite as tender as I thought it would be. That being said, the flavor was good and the presentation fun. All in all, a good experience but I'd probably try out a lot more restaurants in Montreal before coming back. Also, while I don't think it is necessarily overpriced (good portion sizes and high quality ingredients in unique food) it also isn't cheap or one of those places you come out thinking ""wow, that was such a good value.""

The treatment we received from the hostess and servers was simply atrocious. After hearing the high acclaim and a positive recommendation from friends who had eaten here the night before - we were thrilled to dine at Au Pied de Cochon the following night. We made the reservation weeks in advance at the only available time - 10:30pm. We decided to show up a little earlier in hopes we could be seated prior to 10:30. We approached the hostess stand and proceeded to wait there approximately 10 minutes until a hostess showed up and acknowledged us. We gave her our name and reservation information and we were told we could not be seated until 10:30. I completely understand that. We asked if we could get a drink from the bar while we waited. The answer was no. The reason? People are eating at the bar and we can't go get a drink"". So we had to go wait outside. We were sure to stand where the hostess would see us to ensure we wouldn't be missed when it was our turn to be seated. After waiting through the rain outside, the time passed 10:30pm. It was extremely frustrating to see people walking right up to the restaurant and being seated right away AFTER our reservation time. After seeing this, we approached the hostess again to find out what was going on. She looked up at us and greeted us as brand new customers, acting as if she had never seen us before. We had to provide her with our name and reservation information again for her to cross-check. Without any regret or apologies, we were finally seated. The table was directly in a walk way and it didn't take me long to realize the ceiling was leaking and I was being dripped on throughout the entire meal. Especially fun after waiting in the rain for so long. We were ignored by wait staff for another 10 minutes prior to a server finally engaging us. Our friends who had dined there the night before told us their waiter was fabulous at explaining the menu and making suggestions so we asked the same of ours. He provided no such help. We were rushed into making some sort of selection. This was the last time the server came to our table. Somebody else delivered our food. We had to ask for silverware. The fries included in the poutine tasted old and for the amount given - was not worth the price at all. The duck in a can was overly rich. I had a few bites and called it a day. I was already so frustrated we were giving this establishment any of our money. If I could do it again, I would have left after the hostess fiasco. We were hoping the food would redeem the service. It did not. A third person came by to process our payment. When she asked how everything was I had a really hard time crafting a response for that. We told her we weren't impressed. She said sorry and got us on our way. I'm having trouble determining why our experience was SO terrible when the reviews for this place are so high. What is it about us?! It appeared people around us were receiving good service and so had our friends the night before. Must be something about me. Horrible."

The sturgeon was so fishy, I couldn't even finish it.  They were really nice about it though and let us replace the fish with something else on the menu."

Their house dish, Pied de Cochon was spectacular! The skin of the roasted pork underneath that gravy... Superb! It was so delicious and the flavors really complex. French Onion soup is a must here as well as the Apple, Bleu cheese & Endive salad. The soup was well made - not overly salty and made from scratch (the way it should be). We added 100g foie gras which elevated the dish to another level of decadence!Foie Poutine was the dish to catch my attention on Yelp. But unfortunately, it was the most forgettable dish of the night - What Poutine? Another dish that fell short from hitting the mark was Duck in a Can. My gosh, this dish was super salty! Aside from the saltiness, I just don't remember anything about the Duck in a Can. There is a cocktail made with fresh squeezed orange juice - get it! This drink was the most amazing cocktail I've ever had. Service here is great :) Very friendly staff that is attentive, talkative but not overbearing."

I think it doesn't matter what you order it'll be more than satisfying. I had a ""wow"" experience as I ate the dish named after the restaurant - Au Pied de Cochon. It consisted of pig's food perfectly cooked in a heavy savory sauce with mushrooms, foie gras and mashed potatoes. The first bite was the absolute best. I couldn't believe how good it tasted. This meal is best shared with someone as it is heavy and too much for one patron. In addition to the food, I had a blueberry mojito made with the restaurant's own gin...very refreshing and tasty. They also have a nice wine list if you want it by the glass or bottle. Be ready to pay for what you are getting; it's worth it. The people working there are also extremely accommodating & friendly.

/user_details?userid=33h9Jv4VKbbxB42CUD9WQg,Wahed K.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Indulgence and excess of the highest order is how I'll remember my night at APDC. This was a meal to end all meals. We had reservations for 8:00 pm on a Wednesday and I almost wish we hadn't eaten anything the whole day. We knew we were in for a night of unrivaled gluttony the moment we walked in, smelled the food and noticed the huge portions sizes on some of the plates.We wanted to start off with something kind of light (by APDC's standards) and got the blue cheese salad,  a sizable plate that came with endives and chunks of blue cheese.  I tried not to use too much cheese on the bread they had given us when we sat down but their fresh bread was addictive and helped balance out the strong cheese.The second dish was one of the specials on the night - baked clam with cheese sauce. I have a hard time stopping myself from trying clams whenever it's on the menu, especially at a place like this when I knew they would prepare it in a way I've never had before. It didn't disappoint. As heavy as the sauce was, the flavors were well balanced and even though each bite was probably a hundred calories, I couldn't help myself from mopping up some of the sauce with more bread.We were already getting full so when informed that our Pied de Cochon with foie gras was going to take a bit of time to come out, we were glad.  When it finally arrived, any delusions we had of trying the duck in a can afterwards quickly disappeared. It's as if French gastronomy took a look in the mirror, didn't like what it saw, and decided to get juiced. All I could do at first was look at the huge portion size of the dish and then feel intimidated by the size of the foie gras sitting on top of the pile of pig knuckles, chunks of pork and onions . Somehow after an hour of battling this dish, aided on by 3 shots of single malt Scotch, we emerged victorious. The only thing I lost in the process was my dignity.APDC is not the place to come and hold back. This place is a weight watcher's worst nightmare... but sometimes it's good to be bad and if you are thinking of going all out,  there's every reason for you to come here."

Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense."

Every dish was huge so plan to share. We ordered the charcuterie and the prosciutto was unbelievable and the chorizo was fantastic. The asparagus with morel mushrooms is delish. My honey ordered the steak that was served with a massive morel stuffed with foie gras on a bed of mashed potato. My pork chop was WAY too big for me but the flavor was delish. My honey also enjoyed the lemon meringue tart (he mentioned it was unusual with a flaky/crunchy base). We watched some incredible meals being delivered. The duck in a can sounded weird to me but so many people ordered it and were raving about how delicious it was. The owner was actively walking around, greeting guests, chatting to staff and made us feel welcome. When you make your reservation, specifically ask for a table, we were initially seated at the bar (which I normally love) however my honey kept getting knocked by the staff and guests. We requested a move to a table and the hostess very reluctantly agreed and was quite snooty about it so that was the only drawback of this fabulous spot."

/user_details?userid=a6EhIkvlAnZeGyBCZ_7OmQ,Nancy L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",4 star rating,"Called here to make a reservation and glad we did because this place was packed and now I see why. The foie gras here is better than Daniel's in NYC and reasonably priced as well. So here's what we've tried: We were going to try the Poutine au foie gras for appetizer like everyone else, but our waiter highly recommended the Plogue à Champlain, claiming that it is his absolute favorite dish so we had to try that instead. And....it was AMAZING! In simple terms, the Plogue à Champlain is a combo of buckwheat pancake, potato,  fle-aux-grues cheddar, fried egg, thick cut Canadian bacon and foie gras covered in a maple syrup. Super rich and flavorful, and the foie gras itself just melts in your mouth. Unforgettably delicious. For main courses, I ordered the Duck in a Can, and my husband had the Catch of the Day, which was their tuna steak. The Duck in a Can was unique and unlike anything I've tried before (the can was opened right at table side and contents flipped/poured on top of veggie puree). The foie gras and duck meat were even a little bloody looking on some parts, but the waiter guaranteed that everything is cooked (super cooked) in 200+ degree temperature. I don't know, I probably wouldn't be ordering that again. Don't get me wrong, the duck meat itself was tasty, but the veggie puree/sauce was too salty and the foie gras was too bloody looking for me. As for the tuna steak, the husband said it was very good. Unfortunately, I couldn't try since it was raw, only seared on the sides and raw fish is definitely not for pregos. To be honest, I shouldn't even be eating foie gras, but I could not resist so let's just pretend that's ok. Anyway, I did not find their desserts interesting, so skipped dessert here. Oh and did I forget to mention that I had lots of their house bread? Their house bread (baguette) was so good, coupled with the soft butter. I was very satisfied since I walked in starving. PS: Overall, the foie gras was top notch. I was also impressed with their service; the bread was refilled when down to 1 slice. Water glass was never left empty. Super knowledgeable waiter who wasn't afraid of being adamant about certain dishes when asked for his opinion. Definitely worth a try if in the area, enjoy~"

The $22 ""Pied de Cochon"" came with the richest mashed potatoes and fried thing on top and very hearty sauce underneath. The huge piece of meat would've been enough for dinner for a family.

From start to finish. Tighten up. Preface: I own a small wholesale pasta company in California. (It costs me more to run than I make) I'm not bragging. I make my paycheck working 50-60 hours a week in another restaurant. I take a lot of pride in my work there as a pastry chef. I don't make a lot of money. I DO invest heavily on where I spend it. And here I am. In Montreal. The most beautiful and fantastic city I've ever been to. (Seriously... Well done civil engineers)I call a month before my trip. (For my 30th birthday) and instead of calling the number I left on the answering machine, they call the number I  used to make the call which was the restaurant I work at. After a frustrating (although hilarious) interaction of two different restaurant hostesses not knowing they're taking to anther restaurant. I confirmed my reservation. So we arrived. 15 minutes to spare. Thank you Opus card. ""Bonjour, avez-vous une réservation"" ""Oui,"" I said with fear. (Knowing there would be a follow up question in French and I just exhausted the extent of my French vocabularie. Why couldn't she have started in Spanish. I would have had a chance then.)Well, now I've been outed. No problem she speak very good English. And... It turns out I don't have a [recorded] reservation... B-effing-S. 20 minute wait. Well I've already come across the continent, I'll just be patient.Boom. We're sat. We got a beer and a wine, and we order a couple things to start.  Then she returns to finish our order and we order Au Pied de Coichon with foie. First, Bison Tongue comes. Done. Fantastic. Second, Dumplings come. 6 for 12$, or 12 for 24$. I got twice as many as I ordered but I understand the mix up. Maybe my fault maybe hers. But we can split the difference. They were fantastic.And now comes the main event....Any minute now.................. (sigh)......... She returns...She notified us it'll be here shortly 10-15 minutes. (The seed of frustration has be planted.)""What?!"" I look around and think to myself, ""I was here well before that 4 top over there was even sat. And they've got multiple courses. They're all happily eating their main entrees. And this two top directly next to me was sat at least 30 minutes behind me and they're almost done."" (My frustration seed is budding with impatience.)After an excruciating period of being ignored by our server. She was really good at that. We'll call her Matthrine with a C. I stop her and ask her very politely. ""Will our food be much longer?""She ""promises"" it'll be ""right out"" whatever that means. 45 f@$k!4G minutes later we get our 1 entree. The manager himself dropped it off. He rectified, ""I'm sorry for the wait. (Blah Blah) I'll take care of this."" I smile. I literally don't want this. I didn't want this a while ago. I would have gladly shot this dying horse 30 minutes ago and just parted ways. But no. You ignored me and ""tried"" to make it right. Now we're all in this mess together.The pig foot is here, just eat. Thank god. At least the kitchen is worth the hype. Well done. So now here we are. I'm done. I've given up. I'm exhausted. I literally have to pay more money than it's worth to be as angry as I am right now. So I ask for a check. And a new problem. Our server informs us she was going to send out a dessert. I felt confused. I've never been in a place where I wanted to refuse a free dessert. I just want to go back to my hotel room and conclude my birthday on or around the toilet like I do every year. She walks away.Well, I grabbed her attention seconds after that exchange and just ask for it to go. She insisted mind you. The expression on her face says that's somehow a problem. She brings us two glasses of something I can only describe as the syrupy excrement of an apple tree. And the bill... Full price. Apparently they charged me for the time I sat there waiting for my food.  F-you. Here's your cash. Here's the generous 12% shit tip you didn't even earn. We leave. I cool off. I get to the hotel. I lie down. Hooray I'm 30 and should have gone somewhere else for my birthday. [Pity party]Two hours later. I wipe my tears away. After all, I'm an adult now. ""Maybe a free dessert will cheer you up."" I take a bite. It's undercooked I think... Maybe that's intentional. I take another bite, it awfully bitter. I flip it over and the bottom is burnt. Like Cajun salmon. Black. ""Custard"" or whatever that was filed with runs out like syrup. It's a tart shell with a half inch of chocolate glaze? Anyways... I spent the rest of my night here. On yelp. Hoping someone fires you. Thanks for the classic 'bait and switch...'I'm apparently missing something here. Fml."

Called before leaving the US to make reservations to sit at two of the five or so counter seats they have that overlooks the kitchen (were Tony sat). It was absolutely amazing to see how many fantastic plates were consistently handed out from such a tiny space. Watching the chefs true symphony of movements between one another was incredible. The food, ahhhh the food. So rich, inventive, highest quality ingredients. Husband had a foie gras burger. Thought it would be a burger with a slice of foie on top. Nope, Whole ""patty"" was foie. I had the terrine. Cannot find the words to experience the flavors and textures, other than to boldly say an orgasm in my mouth. Chatted with the chefs the whole time and even got to meet the owner/head chef toward the end of our meal. As a result we were offered several free tastings of other menu items including foie gras poutine and even little deep fried cubes of foie (yup, I know). (Another advantage of sitting at the bar.) For the first and only time in my life I experienced a true ""food coma"" is.

It was entertaining as we waited an 1.5 hours for our pigs head. In between us and the pig's head, we had a few appetizers. The fried fois gras and carpaccio. The fois gras happily popped in our mouth. Finally, alas when our pigs head came out all eyes were on us. It was over-the-top. There was a half lobster in it somewhere. A gold foil delicately balanced on the dead pig's head cheek. A separate sauce was made to drizzle on the brains. Who knew the head contained all these marvelous textures of pork? AU PIED DE COCHON did. We washed it down with delicious local beer (Cheval Blanc) Expensive, but plus side was, being American it felt like the menu was 25% off. NOTE: THE BATHROOM IS COOOOL.

We went here for my birthday dinner and it was pretty interesting.We had pickles pig tongue, Bison tongue and blue cheese and Apple salad for appetizer. Pickled tongue was not my favorite but bison was pretty good. Loved the salad.I had the pork chop which was tender and delish, and my husband had a special dish which was pretty much was the pig's leg - pig knuckles, pig shank, meatballs with potatoes and some veggies on the side. It looked like a hearty dish and our French Canadian friend said he had this kind of dish at home growing up. Make sure to make a reservation. We called one month ahead and they gave us a choice of 5pm or 9pm... popular place. Worth trying at least once, I liked the casual ambiance, but very snug seating. Bathroom situation was odd for the size of the restaurant... one unisex stool with 3 faucet...?"

We got the lobster roll & small order of the fois gras poutine. Both were absolutely phenomenal. I don't use that word lightly folks. PHENOMENAL. The poutine was surprisingly not heavy, given what it is...fries, gravy, fois gras...It's a MUST try. I can't sum it up in words. The lobster roll was equally as remarkable. The bread was perfection, fresh, crispy just where it needed to be, buttery (I love the French and their butter obsession) and the lobster chunks were gigantic and fresh! There was fresh parsley in the lobster meat as well as something else that I can't quite put a finger on. The result was something truly unforgettable. Get a reservation. This place is busy around the clock for a reason & it's tiny. If I ever return to Montreal, this will be first on the list to revisit."

Next we got the show stopper.... The foie gras poutine which was nothing short of spectacular.  All of the flavors combined perfectly.  If I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be that.  We also had foie gras tout nu which was also delicious.  My girlfriend and I thought we were still hungry so we got the gnocchi.  They prepared it table side mixing everything in a large cut out cheese wheel peeling off cheese while they mixed if was great.  We could not even finish this..... We were so stuffed.  Our clothes felt like they got a few sizes tighter and our waist lines a bit bigger we had to get dessert to go.  But a few hours later a pecan pie in bed was a perfect way to finish the night!Overall of the best meals I've had in my life.   A MUST GO TO in Montreal.  Will 100% be back."

Saturday night was definitely packed and loud.  If a group of your party is waiting patiently for your table, the hostess will offer your party beers or glasses of wine.Since we were a party of 2, we opted for the bar to watch the action.  We started out with some cocktails that included maple syrup and since most of these dishes were decadent, my friend and I opted for plates to share.Based on the recommendation of our waitress, we started out with plogue à champlain which was smothered in maple syrup, topped with foie gras and cheese.  The plate was rich and sweet and for my taste buds, the perfect way to start a meal on a chilly evening.I recommended my friend try poutine and our waitress recommended it with foie gras but since we already had a dish, it would be overkill and just opted for the classic.The best dish was the PDC melting pot which was blood sausage, pork belly, and sausage in mash potatoes.  Between the cocktail, PDC melting pot and the plogue à champlain, this one of the first meals in a long time where I refused dessert!  There was definitely no room in my stomach and there's usually a reserve but after experiencing PDC, I am a total devotee of all things Martin Picard."

I'm just saying you shouldn't eat the 24 hours preceding your reservation (and you WILL need a reservation - people were being turned away at the door because the restaurant was fully booked until midnight!).I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I had a more 'fine dining' experience in mind when I booked a table for me and my sister during our Montreal vacation. I was greeted with a bustling bistro/pub combo that fully embraced the gorgeous summer weather with an open storefront. Our table wasn't ready but they had availability at the bar with a perfect view of the kitchen, so we opted for the 'dinner and a show' experience. It did not disappoint! There were 2 cooks (chefs?) in charge and a floating number of supporters manning the 2-stove, 12-burner, no flat-top, and one double fryer line. How they pumped out food for what must have been an 80-seat restaurant AND take out orders is beyond me.The food was DELICIOUS. We opted for the tried-and-true fare - a plate of the foie gras poutine, duck in a can, and the eponymous signature dish. Such richness!!! I've never eaten that much foie gras in one sitting in my life! I couldn't even make it halfway through my entree (and that NEVER happens to me). Even after having a day to reminisce over the flavors, I still can't decide which was my favorite dish - I recommend trying them all.This is - in every sense of the phrase - a 'splurge meal' (for your wallet and your waistline) but it is WELL worth it!!!"

This was my first experience of Poutine. I had the Foie Gras Poutine and I was not disappointed! It was amazing. Any poutine I ever have again will always be compared to this dish. Also had the seared tuna belly on the recommendation of the server. It was an excellent choice.  Service is a little slow just because the place is so rocking busy! The sign of a good restaurant so it's hard to complain. I was in town on business and so travelling solo - arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday and I was lucky to get a seat at the bar without a reservation. But they did ask how long I would be staying because there was someone else with a reservation for 8pm. I wouldn't have thought this would be an issue because it was 2 hrs before but with the slow service I was out until 745pm. I'd definitely go again but it would be more fun with a group. And reservations - there's no way to get a table without it.

My well traveled Hungarian friend from Silicon Valley suggested I look up restaurants that Anthony Bourdain had recommended. So I ended up at Au Pied de Cochon completely ill prepared, Little did I know that typically reservations can be made months in advance. As I came through the door as a party of one they asked if I had a reservation I said no and the maître d' said I'm sure we can find a place for you would you mind sitting at the bar? And of course I would prefer that anyway. I was unaware that this was going to become my indoctrination to real French food. I'm not going to mention the dishes that I ate, they were specials of the day and you probably will not find them when you visit this place. But I ate things that I would've never ordered in another situation and they were delicious. I was fortunate to be seated next to a gentleman who is a regular and a favorite of the chef so throughout dinner I experienced an array of delicacies I would have avoided in another situation.

I called in one or two weeks in advance, and I had to choose between a 10pm table or 5pm. As my partner and I are not late night snackers/eaters, we chose the 5pm. Lesson here is call very early to book. Even when we went in, we see people walking in and asking for a table - they were always rejected. In terms of decor - it's very  nice. I really like how they grow rosemary outside their restaurant and harvest it afterwards. When you walk by, you get that whiff of rosemary smell. When you get into the restaurant, depending on where you sit, you can see how they function in the kitchen. The spaces are indeed a little tight. But not so small that you cannot walk through.My partner and I ordered the duck in a can, Beef tartare temaki, Maple creme brulee. I was exceptionally surprised at how amazing every single dish was. My absolute favourite had to be the duck in a can. I saw so many people raving about it. But was a little hesitant because I'm not much of a duck fan. But wow, it was so tender, and flavorful. Absolutely worth that $$$ price tag. The Beef Tartare Temaki was also veery good, and the Creme Brulee was quite large. Amazing food. Period. Service here was also impeccable.

Let me start off I was kind of skeptical of going there as I don't really mess with foo grai..lol. It's not really big in Nj/ny but I really wanted to try the place as we literally stayed around the corner from there. I called literally 2 days before and was able to get fri night reservation for 930pm which actually ended up perfect for us . My uber driver talked about the place and told us to try the duck fries and place was awesome which got us even more excited. From the minute we walked in we were excited. Cozy little set up and were seated for 4 right away. Place is pretty loud but great atmosphere. Our waiter was awesome explained everything on the menu with a cool French accent  along with all specials that were out. One thing I wish they explained that portions which are pretty big and some can feed more than 2 people such as the specialties had  duck confeit. Wine list is extensive and we ended up with a bottle of red light bodied mergot 2014 for 62 bucks Canadian which was recommended by our waiter. Wine was awesome just perfect for all types of dishes and tastes.  Wines look like can get expensive as there only a few under 100 bucks. They brought some delicious warm bread with butter and for appetizers we picked putine fries which was good but super heavy. 2nd appetizer was pasta with dry smoked sausage not sure what was called as as was off the menu and a special but great. We ordered Guinea hen for 2.. 90$( more like for 3 people I would say) it was amazing!! Cooked to perfection super crispy skin with great gnocchi mixed with peas and garlic. Great combo I  say no need to order any other sides. WARNING TAKES 50 min to cook. So order right away or some appetizers as that's how long it will take. The other 2 dishes were off special menu -duck confeit which was super good and crispy and nicely glazed with a bed of mashed potatoes with sauce of apples and most likely maple syrup as u can't go without especially in Canada. The other meal was fettuccini with pork pieces with aged cheddar.This was prepared table side which was a show stopper for everyone around and I'm attaching a video if the special still available definitely worth ordering. Be prepared bill came to over 350 Canadian  for 4 ,but all worth it for the experience. Awesome place!! Overall experience 5 stars, everyone in group loved it.

Waiter explained all the specials but pay attention because they're quite a handful to remember.Lots of foie gras and truffle on the menu. If you're a fan of either, this is the place to be!The bison tartare was delish! You pour the quail egg yolk onto the tartare & then bite into a savory melt-in-your-mouthful of bison tartare. It's like a sushi roll you'd wish to eat every time. The tartare is spiced and packed with flavor. And I have to admit the texture was great too - the chef had added some fried flakes onto the tartare to give it a bang.We also got the squid special of the night. Imagine fried pieces of squid and calamari sitting on top of a pile of curd cheese and French fries. Then imagine a lovely thick savory black squid ink sauce poured over it and then typed with edible gold flakes. Amazingly delicious!I got the bone marrow expecting it to be out of my mind. I was slightly disappointed because it wasn't full of flavor as I had expected. The vegetable puree, however, did have a lot of truffle in there.Get the foie gras poutine. The foie gras was so buttery soft - it just literally melted in my mouth.The duck in a can was amazing. Savory soft duck pieces and a piece of foie gras prepared so well, then resealed in a can. Imagine opening that can and seeing all that meat and gravy pouring onto a light pile of mash potatoes and a slice of buttery toasted baguette.Do get the sugar pie!!! Amazing way to end the night. Lightly grainy maple sugar syrup filling topped with a light cream sitting on a flaky buttery crust. And to be accompanied by 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side?! Hell yeah!!!Ambience was loud but this place was poppin'! Great place to grab delicious grub with friends. DO come here. So worth the visit in Montreal!"

You'll probably need to make a reservation, but it's worth it. Now, I have to say that the whole process ordering was really jarring and slightly off-putting because I was starving and there were so many specials that needed to be explained to me.... but they weren't really soaking in as it's not a very simple explanation for anything, so you kind of feel the weight on your shoulders of having to learn a fable to pass it down to another generation (any diner next to you who may have missed something) and I think because of that, 80% of it went over my head. SO. We ordered off the menu. First of all, get the poutine. Just order some for the table while you make up your minds on what to order. The duck in a can seemed to be a crowd favorite and was very *cough* instagrammable... but I went for the pork in the end and wasn't disappointed. You really couldn't go wrong here as long as you like pork, fois gras and don't worry about your fat intake.

I was a bit surprised by the very modest and modern ambiance of the restaurant - it was a warm evening so the entire front of the restaurant was open and I'm glad it wasn't a typical stuffy high end restaurant. Complimentary bread was brought out and though we wanted to restrict our bread intake to save our appetite, we couldn't help but eat more slices than we wanted to :) Next, came the Plogue à Champlain, which was foie gras sitting on top of potatoes, cheese, bacon and some maple syrup (the perfect combination of sweet and savory). This dish was ridiculously good and unlike anything I've ever tasted especially when combined with the perfect texture of the foie gras. For main, we decided to share the infamous duck in a can along with a side of sugar shack potatoes. The duck took a very long time to come out or maybe it just felt like forever to my salivating taste buds but when the server brought out a can, I was definitely a bit disappointed that it took so long. He then of course went on to explain that the duck was canned in the afternoon and they cook it in the can. He opened the can and poured out the contents onto a plate - I felt like I was watching an art exhibition haha. Needless to say, the duck was amazing. The only semi disappointment of the meal was the potatoes - probably should have gotten the poutine instead. I can't wait to come back and try the foie gras nigiri - they are definitely innovative and creative."

At only $3.50 you should def make sure to try this - I promise you'll be tempted to order more.The foie gras poutine - I thought the foie gras would be way too much on such a rich dish, but it melded so well with the cheese/gravy and added a delicious extra layer of flavor.The duck in a can - this was intense. The presentation was amazing (the waiter brings a can opener to the table, opens up the cutely branded can, and pours out the contents on a giant plate). The duck was almost steak like, something I wasn't expecting, but which proved to be a great balance to the creamy texture of the foie gras. The vegetable broth had amazing flavor, although it was very soft, almost mushy. Make sure you pick out the garliccloves though - these were delicious. Overall, really original (both flavor and presentation) and worth the high price tag.Other notes:*the dark chocolate pot de creme we had for dessert was another winner.*try the house brew - I want to say its pilsner style, really good complement to their food.*even though our server was slammed (seems common in Montreal, even in higher end restaurants), he spent time helping us understand the menu and overall gave excellent service - and even snapped a photo of us at the end of our meal!I think this was the stand out meal on my visit to Montreal - which is saying a lot in a city brimming with amazing food options. Ill be dreaming about this meal until my next trip to Montreal."

Au Pied de Cochon is not for the faint hearted and be prepared to fully indulge.Au Pied de Cochon gets booked up quickly, so try to make reservations in advanced.  When you're here expect that everything you eat will be extra savory & fatty.  We ended up with a 10pm Saturday reservation booking about a week in advance. We started with the tomato tartlet which is probably the healthiest dish we tried. The french onion soup was too salty for my taste and took away from any enjoyment. We followed with the foie gras poutine, my goodness it's hearty and overwhelming.  But wow the flavor is amazing.  They do not cheap out on the foie gras either.  Then we moved onto the special of the night, a 1.5 lb lobster roll topped with foie gras slices and spicy mayo.  This dish again was overwhelming, but the chunks of fresh lobster paired with foie gras was over overpowered by the spicy mayo.  Would definitely recommend ordering without the spicy mayo. They have this amazing desert of poached pear & vanilla ice cream that cleanses your fatty arteries after your hearty meal of indulgence."

As with all of my five-star rated restaurants, this place blew me away with the food and atmosphere.  Although there are aspects that I can nit-pick (e.g. unmarked bathrooms and some absent-minded waiters at times), I must tip my hat to the exquisite and delicious meals.Here's what to order:* Foie Gras Cromesquis - this is Foie Gras melted inside a fried ball of awesome.  It's like hot sex in your mouth in a very good way (not that there's a bad way).* Tarragon Bison Tongue - some people may say ""ewwww tongue"", but you will not be disappointed if you order this. The meat just melts in your mouth and the tongue flavor is lightly masked by a delicate sauce.  I could have probably had 3 of these and that would have been good enough as a meal for me.* Duck in a Can - I thought this was just for the novelty of having a duck in a can being opened and poured onto your plate, but no... it's much more than that. It's everything delicious and unhealthy that you'd gladlly die for multiple times.  The amount of oil and fat in this is ridiculous - you can see it giving you a heart attack before you even take the first bite, but alas, you will bite into heaven and close your eyes in pleasure.  Included in your half duck is foie gras - the whole chunk of it.  Everything about this was amazing - including the bread dipping and stomach holding afterwards. There's too much rich, dense amazingness in this meal to be kept all to yourself, so please share.Everything about the meal was fantastic. I ate here on Saturday night and I'm still full.

/user_details?userid=HWLr60IBXAy9HD23W3Xmfg,Lesley L.,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm so conflicted about PDC. Was it good?  Yes. Was it mind-blowingly amazing; a lavishly decadent meal guaranteed to make your own liver into foie gras from overconsumption of luscious aforementioned product (from a duck and hopefully not a human)? Ehhh. Maybe it's because I had super hyped it up on my own head.  Having learned of PDC ~10 years ago, it took awhile before I had the chance to visit Montreal again.  It also takes awhile to get reservations: I once found out that 1 month in advance wasn't nearly enough notice for reservations.  This time, I called 4 months ahead to nab the spot. The best thing about PDC for me was the service. Super friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I was planning to go on a foie gras bender, but the waitstaff gently recommended that I not make myself sick and hate foie forever.  With his advice, here's what ordered for the night:- Foie gras cromesquis: tiny squares of breaded & fried foie gras, popped in one bite so the molten liquid foie spreads across your tongue in all its delicious glory.  Think sugar cube, made of foie. - Naked foie gras: Two generous slabs of foie that's been seared and covered with what I recall as balsamic reduction.  It was good, but I just thought there would be less ""stuff"" on it, y'know? - Savoury clams on the half shell: Raw pasta clams - I didn't even know you can eat these raw!  Less toothsome than the usual cherrystone variety and of course, much smaller given the nature of the savoury clam. The hubs found them fishy. - Duck carpaccio: A thin sheet of raw duck covers the plate and is then dotted with accoutrement like egg yolk.  Am sorry to say that I can't recollect much else of the dish at the moment, but I remember having liked it while the hubs found it ""weird and gamey"". - Duck in a can: Basically duck cooked sous-vide.  Impressive showmanship when the can is opened at the table and poured into the dish on front if you.  The duck itself is okay, but I wish the skin were crispy...also, this may sound ridiculous and bum-holey, but I thought it tasted very single-noted (like plain old duck).  There was a slab of foie gras encased in the can too, but somehow the duck itself lacked depth of flavour to me...yes, yes, warned you I'm going to sound like a bum hole!- Braised beef: Promptly and voraciously devoured by the hubs, who echoed through the next week or so that it was the best plate of the night.  This was off the daily specials menu. - Maple pudding Chomeur: Super sweet bread-type pudding- Crepes Suzette: Very liquored up, but set alight at the table to burn off the alcohol so only the taste remainsAs far as restaurants go, I really did enjoy this place.  The conflict for me is likely more internal - I thought that PDC would have the best foie gras in the world.  And while it was certainly readily available, it just wasn't the *~OMG BEST!~*  I'd say keep your expectations in check then go to PDC and enjoy."

The bread was very good. Then, I had the Foie Gras Cromesquis and the Pied de Cochon, also tried some of the Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart. For the Pied de Cochon, the meat was very flavorful but the sauce was too salty and had too much onions in it. The boudin wasn't particularly tasty either. Everything was one dimensional in terms of the flavor. fat fat and more fat!This restaurant is definitely an acquired taste. My arteries definitely cannot take this sort of hit.

Little cubes of sugar cube sized coated bite of foie gras.  The server warms you to eat it in one bite for good reason.  As you break through the coating the unxious liquified foie juice drips on to your tongue and WHAMO, yes you definitely ordered the right thing..  We then had the baccalau fritters which was our least fav thing.  Prob because they had a bit of kick and im not a huge chili fan.  Next we had the perfectly steamed dumplings and octopus which were served in a large Chinese steam basket.  the dumplings were a little clumsy to look at but the flavours were spot on.  The octopus was quite possibly perfection in a dish.  So juicy I actually had to stop and rethink all the times I had ever accepted that octopus has to be chewy, because this dish was perfectly tender and delicious.  We had 2 more dishes, the plague au Champlain which was incredibly decadent and  bit rich  then the mixed pot of pork that included our favourite thing all night, the boudin.  Next time, we would just order the boudin alone it was THAT good  I love that the chef's flavours are rich complex and he respects the simplicity of the ingredients and how they are presented.  Seems very unpretentious, its about the food, not about the perfect table cloths and stuck up servers.  This place is in a great location and has a great vibe.  if you have a chance to enjoy a meal there, just do it, you won't regret it."

However, this was one of the more expensive brunches, I've tried.Servers came by with different types of dishes, and if you want it they will tick off the box on your piece of paper. At the end of the meal you pay for the dishes you ordered. This is good because you get to see the dish before you eat it. The bad thing is that someone else might get it before you do. We managed to snag the last table in the corner before it got really busy. However, because we were in the corner a lot of the dishes were taken before it got to us :(. The food server was good in making sure that we got some dishes. The waiter was friendly and checked in on us. The only bad thing about the service, was in the end there was a delay in getting the bill as he seemed to get a bit frazzled, because it was so busy. We tried several different dishes. My favourite dish was the foie grois potato, with pork. This was delicious! Very different from anything I've tried before. The foie grois nicely complemented the potato. I just wish there was more of it! Yum.... The maple gnocchi was interesting a little on the sweet side for me but the gnocchi itself had a great texture it was light and fluffy. The french toast was good, but not as good as some of the other dishes. The only dish that I didn't enjoy was the blini. The almond croissant was amazing; flaky, buttery, and had great almond taste. Get it this if you like almond croissants. There is a person that comes by with a cart with different baked desserts, cake, fruit and melted chocolate, and shakes if you so desire. I was sad that I didn't get to try to sticky ribs, which I was really looking forward to. Other people looked like they really enjoyed it.

/user_details?userid=zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw,Murray W.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"PDC, you get my 100th review. When it came to be that my friend and I were going to be spending a couple nights in Montreal on our way to Ontario, I knew one thing I had to do, and it was eat at one of the hallmarks of modern restaurants in the country, Au Pied de Cochon. After anxiously awaiting email confirmation on reservations and receiving such, we were all set.Located on the quaint Duluth Ave, PDC is almost easy to miss, without a lot of obvious signage, but we knew the street number that we were looking for. It was a lovely Sunday evening and the restaurant was mostly full, but we were seen to and seated immediately. For such a famous place, it isn't large and is somewhat narrow, although the open kitchen is a treat. It was interesting to listen to the hustle and bustle of the French and English as dishes were fired and would have made a good show from the bar in front of it, I'm sure.My buddy and I were on a mission for some great food and we went all out, with two apps and a main each. I went with the pork rinds, cured foie gras tart and just had to try the namesake dish, pied de cochon.The pork rinds came served in a classic sundae glass and were incredibly light and airy with lots of crackle and pop with each bite. There was a mild pork flavour and they were salted just right and altogether had a clean taste with no hints of old fryer oil.I also snagged one of my friend's cod fritters. Crisp on the outside with a doughy (in a good way) center, with just the right amount of fish flavour and a hit of spice that came at the finish.The foie gras tart was a hearty size, with a flaky pastry filled with mashed potato and slices of rich, velvety smooth foie gras, with a balsamic drizzle.Now after these two appetizers I had been of the mind that I was going to get a single pig's foot or hock on some potatoes. It's a modern restaurant and the servings aren't the sort of size that you get at your run-of-the-mill chain family joint. Quality over quantity and all that. It seems however that with the pied de cochon anyway, that the PDC kitchen shoots for both quality and quantity. When my large dinner plate arrived, it was literally covered with food. I was expecting a lot more white space on my plate, and after two apps and a couple beers, I knew that my stomach couldn't nearly handle what was before me. It took me a couple minutes of food shock before I even started to dig in, resigned to the fact that even my hefty appetite stood no chance and that I'd be taking some of this back to the hotel and leaving some pride behind in its place.Two sizable pieces of foot or hock lie beneath a heaping sauce of caramelized onions, peppers and cream while an equally impressive mound of mashed potatoes was topped with a fritter. The sauce was obviously quite rich and full of flavour while the pig's feet themselves had a thick skin that was still quite crisp despite the plentiful sauce. Pig's feet and hocks are quite fatty and can have a somewhat off putting texture because of this, but there was a great dark pork meat flavour to help offset all the fat. The potatoes are wonderfully smooth and seasoned, however the onion and dijon croquette was a bit too potent for my tastes.This meal put me into a serious food drunk state for a couple hours, but it was more than worth it and if you're in town, you have to give this culinary institution a visit."
/user_details?userid=MgAgvJwlt8ujtE4Pr0r9uQ,Cat N.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"We all went back and forth many times on whether APDC should get three or four stars. I thought we were off to a good start when I was able to make reservations and confirm via email, vs over the phone as their website says. I checked in early with the hostess, and she told me that they were clearing up tables in the back, and within 5 to 10 minutes would get us in. 45 minutes later, many people empty from their tables, and a few people that came after us were seated before us! I was outraged.Outrage redux when people seated after us were then attended to and served before us. I believe because we're younger patrons, they figured we wouldn't be cash cows like the monied yuppies or older men could be.Inside, the restaurant has no decor or theme to speak of. There's only ONE bathroom for the entire restaurant, awkwardly set behind the bar area so that you have to maneuver past the bins and staff. I did give them one extra star in my book for playing Montreal music such as Leonard Cohen (!!) and Arcade Fire. We started with the foie gras cromequis, which really were surprising but pleasant explosions in your mouth. The foie gras tart followed: a nice melted circle of cheese and foie gras on a buttery pastry. We were all waiting for the foie gras poutine, and we all chose it as our favorite. The mix of melted foie and the usual gravy was sinful. Our final dish was the PDC melting pot, and it was a more disappointing note to end on: with sub-par blood sausage and what was sadly too much like a hot dog.Make sure you share everything: it sounds as though we ordered very little for four, but any more than the amount we got and we would have passed out at the table from the richness. My friend actually described her state as ""food drunk"". I'm glad we went at least once to see what all of the hype was about. Even if it didn't quite live up to it as the best meal of my life, it's up there."
/user_details?userid=7qFH1RkPivVRcwxLwhyixg,Lea A.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"I love Martin Picard's restaurant. The ONLY thing preventing this from being 5 stars is that I found the place a bit cramped, and we sat beside the doorway on a cold winter evening, so was a bit drafty for me (I wore my jacket indoors).Otherwise, the food is fantastic. Now, I'm not going to wax poetic about the restaurant namesake dish -- so delicious -- or how a simple sugar pie blew my mind. It's all been said in the past reviews.What I do want to say is that Martin Picard has created a high level restaurant that's actually accessible to different types of financial circumstances. This is super important in that allows you to have no awkward situations with friends who may choose to simply have a $20 or under meal (one entree can be argued to feed two people due to the portions), while someone else in the table decides to blow the bank with $100+. There are options for whatever your gastronomic budget for the evening may be.So, if you're thinking of a place that offers great food and service with varying price ranges, this is the place for you.

Now that I have that out of the way...My husband and I started the meal with the whelks appetizer. It was the first time either of us had tried this shellfish and we were blown away. The snails had been removed from the shell, cleaned, chopped and replaced in the shell then baked  in the wood-fired oven with garlic, breadcrumbs and butter.My husband had the boudin and fois gras with puff pastry for his entree. The portion was plenty for two to share especially considering the richness of the dish. I had the pork shank with risotto, another dish that could easily be split by two diners. The pork was tender and  delicious. However it was outdone by the gravy...so delicious I can't stop thinking about it. We had pecan pie and ice cream for dessert...this time we decided to share!  Both aspects of the dish were great (and as a native southerner, I'm a born expert on pecan pie).Wait staff was plentiful and buzzed around like bees since the restaurant was full the whole time we were there.  The only downside was the uncomfortably warm dining room (in all fairness the day was unseasonably warm in Montreal).We were able to find street parking a block away. Be careful as much of the parking is reserved for neighborhood residents."

We were, so my friend and I did two menu items, Duck in a Can and Foie Gras de Champlain. Both yum and very savory. The other two were delicious specials: Duck Carpaccio and the Pork Leg & Risotto. Each course was another level of excitement for the palate. I will definitely return here on each visit to Montreal. The service was spectacular. Very genuine staff who advised you like a friend.

I actually have never been in such a loud place. Even though we were at a tiny table felt like to hear each other we needed mega phones.Super cramped. Food despite the hype was not very impressive. We had the much written about roast pork head with lobster. Lobster fishy un fresh. Pork under seasoned though perfectly tender and cooked. Was such a waste of excellent  meat as pork was super quality and beautifully cooked with crispy skin. We tried fois gras tart ... For anyone who reveres fois as much as I do was super sad. Granted we ate late 9 pm and were among last patrons but everything tastes NOT freshly made and tired. I really cannot understand the positive reviews. Perhaps we had a super off night but at this price point a restaurant needs better quality control.Overall not a destination place. As a neighborhood spot maybe try. But we sampled enough of the menu favorites to be certain there are no stars."

Started with the onion soup (recommend sharing with two people) and HEAVEN in my mouth. The best I've ever had. From there, the meal was ok. Had the fois gras tartine, and the maple butter was a little too much. It came with a lot of bread, and since I had already filled up on bread waiting for my meal (a good 30 minutes), it was a bit much. Finished with the pork flank. The sauce was amazing, but I had so much fat on my pork I could only eat about 2/3 of the ""meat"". I thought the delayed timing between the courses was good due to the richness of the meal. The theme of the dinner was ""fat"". I don't think I would go back- once is enough, but a cool experience."

I mean what's there not to love when the restaurant serves, Duck, Pork and Foie Gras?Seeing as I was unfamiliar with the area and began my pilgrimage to the restaurant (I knew the food I was about to ingest would be full of fat so I decided to get in my exercise for the day). The restaurant was tucked away in a little street and the hidden restaurant had me walk by several times before I realized I had arrived.the decor was nicely decorated, small tables on the sides with a home feel to it and you can see the brick oven in the kitchen. The staff were incredible friendly and spent time to have a conversation. They had a a lot knowledge of the menu and gave me some great recommendations. The smell of the pork fat just made me hungry. The restaurant was busy and loud but gave off a fantastic energy.I had the seasonal maple beer they brewed in house, and it was delicious. Nice balance of malt and maple syrup so it wasn't overly sweet or bitter. Needless to say I had several pints over the course of the night.I started with Cromesquis de foie gras, this little deep fried cubes of Foie Gras were like little bombs of flavor. The buttery melted foie gras with the deep fried exterior was a unique combination. This is a must have! But make sure you listen to the servers instructions on how to eat them, otherwise you'll burn your mouth and ruin your night!Temaki de Bison was a braised bison tongue served with Dijon mustard. The bison tongue was coming apart by the fork and was amazingly tender and melt in your mouth. The Dijon mustard gave it the spicy kick that it needed.My main was the Cured foie Gras & Boudin Tart, the soft foie gras served on top of blood sausages and butter pastry tart was incredible. The foie gras added a slight creaminess to the dish to the dish while the blood sausage added the richness. Needless to say, I had a foie Gras overload and I had to struggle my way back my hotel!

We showed up early on a weekday night for our reservation and had to pretty much wait until our reservation time. One hostess was a little un-approachable, the other one was quite friendly though quiet. Our waiter was excellent. I ordered an appetizer of french onion soup which had a fantastic layer of cheese on top with a good base of soup as well underneath. For my main course, I had a duck dish that was delicious - similar to a steak served with a mushroom and onion sauce and my wife had a pork chop in a similar sauce. Both entrees were fantastic. Dessert we had creme brulee which was great - perfectly crisped and warm on top while still being cold, sweet  and creamy on the bottom. The only major thing that prevents Au Pied de Cochon from being a 5 star place in my opinion is the soap in the bathrooms - it was fairly dingy bar soap. Maybe this is a common thing outside of the U.S. (but I didn't notice it anywhere else) and these are the same restrooms that the cooks use so that was a turn off for me."

/user_details?userid=tjwblGkWN9m0vsGaypJ0Vw,Ben N.,"Cincinnati, OH",5 star rating,"About a quarter-century ago Flavor Flav popularized the admonition, ""Don't believe the hype.""  It is an edict to which I almost always subscribe.But on a night in August, Au Pied de Cochon pounded us into submission with a pork-tastic onslaught so forceful and convincing that there was no doubt: We were compelled to believe the hype, at least on this occasion.The excellence starts right away, because PDC's bread and butter is about the best I've had in a long time:  crusty, chewy, delicous.  This could be a meal in its own right.  Why isn't all bread like this?We started with the pickled tongue, which is a steal at $4.00.  Pig's tongues are surprisingly large, but this was also tender and flavorful (lightly seared, I think), with just enough vinegar edge to amp it up a bit more without getting cloying.Flav's dictum came into play only once.  We also ordered one of PDC's most-hyped items, the fois gras poutine.  It was a little warmed-over and limpid, if still very tasty.  Hat-tip to our server, though, for recommending a half portion, which was not even indicated on the menu and which was plenty reasonable in sizeI got the ""Melting Pot"" as an entree, which basically amounts to a PDC sampler (there is too much great stuff on the menu to choose from!):  basically a thick stew of pork chop, pork belly, blood sausage, and another housemade saugage, and a rich gravy that resulted in the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  Only complaint about this was that the pork chop was just a little on the tough side, but otherwise this dish was mouthwateringly rich, simple, and great.  Wife got the head cheese plate, which, if recall correctly, was served on thin layers of perfectly cooked gratined potatoes and was also terrific.I had slightly worried that the atmosphere at Pied de Cochon might be a bit loutish and douche-ified, given its relative slickness, high profile, hype from certain TV personalities, et cetera.  But in the 7-9PM time slot we were there, it was merely pleasantly lively, with a good mix of folks both age-wise and culturally, and the space was a both cozier and more appealing than I thought it might have been. At only about $120 with tax and tip (and a couple of beers each), very reasonably priced for an experience of the sort you won't find at many other places in North America."

/user_details?userid=Usp0AbFpIkwe2ya3DAbZmQ,Edward B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!"

Party of 3.Food: 86%----***If we had done it all over again, I would have gotten 2 apps and 2 main dishes for a party of 3. You really needed space to enjoy the flavors but we were hurting half way through the 3rd appetizer. lol. Kuddos to au pied de cochon.Foie Gras & Boudin Tart - 90%This is served on a flaky puff pastry. Blood sausage was amazing. The foie gras was a little milder on this dish, and the boudin was definitely the star. Watch out though as there is mustard in this dish, which may put off some diners. Plogue a Champlain - 90%Though the serving was on the smaller side, don't be fooled. This one is one heavy dish. The list of ingredients (if I can remember all of them) were - foie gras on top of cheese, on top of egg, topped with maple syrup, resting on a bed of thin waffles (i think). Anyway, this is explosion of heavy-handed flavors with tons of fat. !! :)Foie Gras Dumplings - 80%Two types of dumplings - pork with foie gras, and shrimp with foie gras in squid ink. There's a third ingredient in each dumpling that I'm forgetting. Served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Comes with 2 sauces served on the side. You pour the soy-maple syrup sauce on a white spoon that they give you, then you place the dumpling on top of the sauce, then you drizzle the spoon with maple syrup (loool). This was a good solid dish, however the foie gras really didnt shine in this one either in taste or texture. This was probably the weakest out of everything we tasted.Duck in a Can - 90%Fat on fat on fat. The foie gras here is a lot less softer than in the other dishes. It has a nice give to it and you would think it's another part of the duck until you slice into it. The duck skin is not crispy since the duck breast has been confited in the can but not seared after like a normal duck confit would be. But regardless, the taste was great, and the sauce on the plate (which I thought was probably some parsnip puree with a lot of butter) went amazingly with every other ingredient. There are 2 pieces of baguettes at the bottom of the dish. Shredded cabbage and carrots. Definitely try this dish, but it would be better on an emptier stomach lol. Pied de Cochon - 80%This one was the biggest (BIGGEST) surprise. SERIOUSLY? The 'serving plate' was a low rise dutch oven. LOOOOOOL. This one was really good. For those who like pig's foot, they did this one justice. The meat was soft but firm at the same time. The sauce around the meat was creamy with a strong hint of tang to it. There was mashed potatoes (I think) at the bottom too. Mushrooms were everywhere. Also, it's a pig's LEG, not just the hoof. So this one destroyed us. Service: 100%----The specials were NUMEROUS but the hostess was very adept, explained everything, was very polite, courteous and patient. She was amazing. Service is either in English or French and they ask you at the very beginning. The servers are obviously more french than the waiter/waitress who takes your order. The service was very efficient, and the people who bring the food to your table are very amicable. NOTE: This was a 5pm reservation, which meant FIRST service time. The place was not packed and I think they purposely do this to stagger the ordering times. The place filled up as we got to our 2nd hour. Ambience: 95%----Spring season, facing the cobble-stone street with the main glass divider open. Bistro, open, airy. Value: 95%---This place is expensive. But I guarantee maximum fullness to the brink of explosion. We had 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes totaling to $200 (no tip yet; we left 20%). But we were already forcing ourselves to finish the rest of the main dishes and still did not finish at all. We had to take the pig's foot back to our hotel with us."

It's a bit of a walk from the metro station but WELL WORTH IT! First of all, they have quite a large menu of items. It might not be listed on the menu, but our waiter read out at least 20-25 more items that I just couldn't repeat even on my best days of memorization.It's a nice casual restaurant that gets very crowded during dinner time so make sure to make reservations as we did. Once inside, you will notice the kitchen area which is manned by quite a few people. Another observation was that all the waiters were men who were probably less than 30 years old, not that there's anything wrong with it. Once seated, we ordered one of the foie gras'. I'm not a huge fan of liver so I didn't like it, but from what I was eating if someone did like it, I think it would taste good to them.For the entree, I ordered the Breast with mushrooms and it was AMAZING. The breast was juicy, soft and the meat was just sizzling in my mouth with flavors. There was a dark, but not heavy, sauce on the plate mixed with the mushrooms which complemented the breast very well. The dish was also quite hefty. The only disappointment I had was that when the restaurant got crowded, the service was a tad slower because all the waiters were running around trying to appease new customers walking in. We waited for the check for at least a good 20 minutes before we could get our waiters attention to bring it, which then resulted in another 15 minute wait for him to bring it. He was a good waiter though in that he gave us good recommendations, read out all the non-menu items very clearly and was very accommodating knowing we were from America. Just wish he knew to pay a little more attention to all his customers and not just new tables."

The waiter gave us a very inaccurate description of a special dish for two -- which ended up being four chunks of lobster and what was supposed to be 200 grams of fois gras -- but instead it was a mess of over-salted pasta covered in cheese for $70. It looked like cat food. And they made us wait 20 minutes in between courses. The poutine with fois gets smaller every year. Way over-hyped and over-priced.  Check out L'Express for really well-prepared food for that kind of money. Dinner for two with wine came to $200 and we took barely took two bites out of our main, but no one asked how it was and then the waiter did nothing about it, charged us anyway. Certainly won't be going back."

The person at the front said she would 'see what she could do' which is almost as infuriating as saying 'calm down buddy.' She saw what she could do and sat us at a 2 top closest to the door, which I thought would suck, but then I realized sitting in the back of the restaurant must have been awful because the restaurant was packed. Anyway...Our server was wacky as hell and rushing around for the from table to table, the 2.5 hours we were there, he still took the time to explain everything to every table.The liver salad, lovely dressing, light flavors, the liver was just irony enough, really great. The Foie Gras Grilled Cheese was perverse, greasy, rich, so flavorful, the bread just soaked up all the goodness. The Duck in a Can is clever, the duck is so well done, really meaty and rich, the extra foie gras tied it all together, it's a good portion for sharing. The key lime pie had a remarkable crust, buttery and rich, enough lime to cut that. Great wine selection, especially by the glass.The food is decadent and rich, the prices are not bad when you really look at what you're getting. I liked it...alot"

One of the star food items is the famous foie gras poutine.  Prices are in line with the other food trucks in the city.Braving the crazy line-up at First Fridays I was lucky to get my hands on some of the last foie gras poutine they had.  Ever tasted something that felt so wrong yet so right all at once?  Wrong because it is so heart-attack inducing but right because it is just too delicious to pass up.  That sums up foie gras poutine.  The fries were very thick and crispy and there was just enough gravy so that they didn't get too soggy without sacrificing the taste.   There was also a good amount of cheese curds and the foie gras added a nice touch to the poutine.The portion was a little small but maybe that's best for my arteries.  The line up was insane too compared to the other food trucks there that night.  My friend and I waited two hours and like I said before we got some of the last foie gras poutine.  Those behind us who had waited the same amount of time weren't going to be so lucky.  It might be best not to visit at First Fridays but the rest of the time when they're out and about."

We shared 4 dishes: fried foie gras balls, foie gras poutine, PDC salad, and the baby pig special. The fried foi gras balls were hot and crispy on the outside, and melted liquid goodness on the inside. Foie gras poutine, however, I didn't want to eat more of after a few bites. The chunks of foi gras were too big to be appetizing for our tastes (we're not used to eating so much of it in that gelatinous chunky form). The PDC salad was really good with nice chunks of meat and crunch to it. The pig special was nicely cooked with crispy outer ""crust"" of the meat and coated with a sweet glaze and came with some vegetables that I enjoyed, but would've enjoyed more if the sauce were less potent.Overall, it was a very satisfying meal to have on a cold winter night.If I ever return to Montreal, I'll come back to try the duck in a can (recommended by a coworker)."

If you have close minded food pals, just order for them and don't explain what it is that they're eating until after the have tasted the glory. Reservations were initially requested by phone followed by email about 6 weeks in advance. I didn't want to take any chances and wanted to get it out of the way. Made it for Thursday at 8:30. We arrived 5 min early and we're seated within fifteen min. Cocktails: $10 for a delicious bourbon sour. I never thought wild turkey could have been blended so well. It had maple and lime and wasn't too sweet. My mom got a whiskey sour special that she enjoyed but felt it was a tad on the sweeter side.Staters :Foie Gras Cromesquis $4.. An explosion of flavor in your mouth. Order it. You get two bite sized amazeballs. If you aren't familiar with foie gras then think of a savory soup filling inside a crunchy shell.

You typically would not find these two things in the same sentence, much less the same dish. The culinary equivalent of the Prince and the Pauper. But Pied de Cochon decides to break status quo and do it anyway. What a rebel. The Foie Gras Poutine is a fancy version of Canada's beloved comfort food. Palate pleasing, yet a little underwhelming. How so? It's as if a waiter holding a foie gras dish and a waiter holding a plate of fries ran smack into each other and attempted to pull of the resulting haphazard combination as a new creation. The fries just physically don't go together with the chunks of foie gras.What I did do was eat them separately. The fries & cheese curds drenched in the sauce was fantastic. The foie gras itself in the sauce was amazing. I guess maybe I shouldn't complain since I got two dishes out of one. More bang for the buck. Fries. Foie gras. ^ That's more accurate.

It was one of my top 3 musts for my visit to Montreal. Before the appetizers came I was telling my brother how I thought this could possibly be my favorite restaurant ever. I can be wrong from time to time.The food was hit and miss. Everything sounds amazing when you read it off the menu, but the execution of some of the dishes left much to be desired. It's probably mentioned a lot but it really can't be emphasized enough: almost all the food is really heavy, fatty, and salty. Items I remember trying and would get again: Foie Gras Poutine (obligatory and good), Duck Carpaccio (best dish of the night), Foie Gras Cromesquis (wasn't amazing but it's interesting and I don't know anywhere else that I could get something like this), and another Foie Gras dish I didn't learn the name of. Dishes I probably didn't enjoy that much: Duck in a can (it was not bad, but I wouldn't get it again since it's so salty and at $44, hefty pricing too), Cod Fritters (meh), Lobster Risotto (ugh the risotto was undercooked and too dry for my taste and everyone else's taste at our table so it was a big disappointment), and the PDC Melting Pot (oh god, the worst thing hands down...all the meats were overcooked to the 7th depth of hell and it was all hard and dry...also no pork belly was in it as promised), and lastly, the Creme Brulee was a major dropping of the ball too (the creme was more like wet curds of tofu in texture and it was sour...what the hell). Creme Brulee is my brother's favorite dessert hands down and you guys made him depressed all night over how bad it was. The servers are really awesome. The main dude was on point as a server. He memorizes orders, is charismatic and helpful, great personality and slightly funny. My brother and I ordered a shit ton and he challenged us to finish it all. We finished everything except we had to take the leftover Melting Pot home. He called us out when we asked for the to-go box for not finishing but it wasn't because we were full. It was just really inedible. I didn't have the heart to tell him that we won the challenge essentially... on top of adding that shitty ass Creme Brulee for dessert afterwards. Glad I tried it out albeit pretty disappointing. The menu is still interesting enough, but I'd probably not come back with all the other great Montreal restaurants around. Le Club Chasse et Peche would be my next target probably (I hear it's the same owner)."

It's quite rich and you can't eat a lot of it. The Duck in a Can dish has 100g of foie gras. Our favourite dish was the Melting Pot. So much sausage and pork all over the most delicious mashed potatoes you'll ever have. And it wasn't so overbearingly rich like the Duck in a Can. The Duck in a Can is a pretty fun, interesting dish. But for my tastes, it's just too oily and fatty. Our server actually congratulated us for finishing as much of it as we did (which was almost all of it). Some parts of it I found difficult to eat due to its richness, but it was otherwise delicious and unique.Service is good, especially considering how busy they are. And it was really fun sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen. I was surprised how small the kitchen was for a restaurant this size.I would definitely like to come back to try more of their dishes!"

I've been trying to get a table here for quite some time so I was super excited that I was actually able to go. It's not really that big of a place, and the decor seems to scream that they've need out cutting wood recently.  I sat at the bar, and got the watch all the magic of the kitchen. I decided to read what the other yelpers were saying and ordered the fois gras appetizer cubes (sorry no idea what they're called [cromesquis] *Thanks Devan R.), the duck carpacho, and the fois gras poutine. I decided to stay away from the duck in a can from previous reviews. Ps do you see a trend? It's fois gras and duck. The appetizer literally exploded with flavour in your mouth. They tell you to let it sit for a while (cause it's literally a deep fried cube of fois) to avoid burning your tongue off. Wow, the flavour of the fois was so rich and balanced. A must order. The duck carpacho was alright I guess, it reminded me of a deconstructed steak tartare, only more bland. Flavours of shallots, salt and egg kinda overwhelmed the dish. The duck was lost. Maybe don't order this. The fois gras poutine probably put me over the top. There was a generous portion of fries, gravy and a lot of fry shaped fois gras. Personally I found this dish way too salty. The combination of the saltiness of the gravy with the saltiness of the fois gras was overwhelming. Besides that, this dish is SUPER rich, like Donald trump style. You could probably just order this and be good. Other than the food, they also have their own micro craft beer that I had a chance to try. It wasn't bad, hoppy and bitter aftertones (kinda Czech style) if you like that sorta thing. Would I come back? Ya I probably would just to try the rest of the menu."

The duck in a can was good, the duck carpaccio was better, the tuna belly was tasty, but none of it blew me away. Most tasted good for a bite or two, and then wore me down with its richness. Especially the beef osso buco, which was the thickest osso buco I've ever tasted. I enjoyed eating at APdC. It's an experience worth having while in Montreal. The service and ambiance are awesome.

The summer menu features lighter fare, so those of you with very sensitive stomachs might be more likely to find a dish that suits your palate then. Excellent wine list, super friendly staff.

I would also recommend the melting pot a tasting of boudin noir, pork sausage, chop, and shoulder over creamy mashed potatoes a meal for one or we get as an app to get all our favorites in one dish.Only downside like all restaurants in this area parking is a bit hard to come by, expect a few blocks walk from the main street."

Tough getting a reservation on a weekend for dinner, but luckily the sunday brunch is first come first served. The brunch is served almost dim sun style where they stroll a cart of brunch dishes to your table and you can pick what you want. They then proceed to mark your menu with the items taken. Just like chinese dim sum.  There are over 30 items available that range from savory to sweet, all unique or a play on some traditional fares. Very delicious and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to everyone.I would put it for 5 stars, but have to take off one star for some organizational issues. They do the push carts, but also allow people to order directly off the menu, and thats fine. Problem is, when we ordered off the menu, some items never got to our table. they somehow got intercepted and put on the regular push cart i suppose? Half the time you dont know if a push card is for people who ordered things or if they will stop by your table. Because of this we were able to try all the item we wanted except for one, where the waiter tried to order it for us 3 times, and still it never showed. Other than that, of which i hope is a only rare occurrence, I highly recommend brunch here, and will hit up the dinner on my next visit."

There were 11 of us so I got to try lots of entrees (and the portions are made for sharing): lobster, hen, happy pork chop, and bison rib. All were very good but the rib was the table favorite. It fell completely off the bone and was covered in a sauce that had a perfect blend of tang and sweet. The sauteed spinach garnish that came with the rib was delicious and would have loved it as a side. The mashed potatoes were also a hit...just like your grandmother made 'em.  (I was not as impressed with the special mussels appetizer, and the duck carpaccio needed some acid so minus half a star.)  Too stuffed for dessert.  Topping it all off was the stellar service, and remember, we had 11 folks at the table.

The food was good, but (and I can't believe I'm saying this), it was too indulgent. Visited in December  2013. We had a pretty simple order. An appetizer. Two mains. Drinks. The off-menu Christmassy appetizer, which was a slice of foie gras, fruit cake, and goat cheese, was interesting. It was an odd melange of flavours, but we didn't come here for typical restaurant fare. So the appetizer got us excited for the mains. My date had duck in a can. It was pretty good from what I tasted. Today all she remembers is plate full of Brown and won't be eating foie gras again, though she's glad she's tried it. I had the off menu (and highly recommended by our server) veal shank with cauliflower mash. The mash was amazing. Really soft textures with a few lumps here and there. Mixed in with the juices of the shank and you got this beautiful velvety texture. Definite win. The shank left more to be desired. Not because it was small (it was epic meal time huge) but because the flavours transformed from beefy goodness to oh-my-god-this-carcass-never-ends. And that's what it felt like after a while. The soft texture eventually reminded me of cutting and chewing into raw flesh. And with the gamey smell and the beefy flavour just lingering in my mouth, I had to abandon the dish. I never abandon dishes. And I didn't abandon this one because it was too much food and I was too full, but because the flavours and textures became repulsive halfway through the experience. I only got though 1/3 of that shank. I don't regret trying this place but it's unlikely I'll return."

Our waiter was also very patient when we asked him a million questions. The only bad thing was that since we got a late reservation, half the menu was out of stock. Next time though...We got the foie cromesquis, which was a small deep fried foie with liquid inside. It literally was an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. You tasted the foie, which was surprising given that it was deep fried. The temaki was delicious- no foie (and also it was beef, not bison since they were out). It was just beef tartar in a sushi handroll with quail egg and some spice but I loved it (not surprising since I'm Asian). The duck carpaccio was delicious (also no foie) - I liked the egg that we had to mix in with it but thought it was too much egg. It wasn't a regular egg either and not a quail egg - it was big but idk what it was. We had the terrine with apple jelly and yes, it tasted as good as it sounds. The salt wasn't evenly distributed so the first bite seemed bland but later on, it was amazing. And a big portion. The regular seared foie was, of course, delicious. We also had the foie on top of a fruit cake. My friends loved it. I liked the foie but I'm not a fan of fruit cake. We also had the foie and boudin tart. The pastry definitely helped to make the dish. The blood sausage was delicious but the potato in the dish seemed overly much. By that point, I was in a food coma. I couldn't even partake in the dessert.  Next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm getting the foie burger."

Needless to say, I was not disappointed.We came here during early spring, when the windows were removed, and you can enjoy the wonderful summer breeze while engorging yourself on the most wonderful of meals. Fortunately, I had placed a reservation two weeks in advance, and we were seated almost immediately by the ""very"" friendly staff. The word ""very"" is in quotation primarily because the waiter was literally standing within 5cm of our faces, but friendly, maybe it's a Canadian thing.As for our meal, we shared the herring, beef tongue, the pate, the duck in the can, and the beef tartare. The beef tongue was absolutely marvelous, dissolving instantaneously in my tongue, leaving nothing but longing for more bites of that savory goodness. The herring was simple, but elegant, and sweet, not overwhelmed by the fishiness that comes with smaller fish. The layers of potatoes chips was a nice touch, but I thought they were fillet slices, alas. The pate was alright, don't remember much. As for the duck in a can, oh man, I think it was definitely the presentation more than anything else that sold me. The waiter came with a large can, with very amusing illustration of a duck cartoon, and poured the contents directly over a toast and pureed (unknown deliciousness). The duck was cooked with root vegetables and fois gras inside the can, and it was so tender and juicy that I would highly recommend it to everyone. Although, if the duck didn't come from a can, I may not have paid $44 for it. The beef tartare was good, but wasn't mind blowing. I did see other people ordering the pig head (which was HUGE) and the hen for 2, but I'll save that for next time. Also, if you wanted any of the pork dishes or the rib, just know that there was enough meat on that platter to keep Fred Flintstone in a food coma until the year 2000.Overall, I was very pleased with my meal, especially paired with an excellent bottle of wine, and the best company money can never buy.

Our waitress kept checking herself out every chance she got. She did so while talking to us, taking our order and following up on the food. Caught her a few times walking by our table and doing the same thing. Quite funny actually. If you end up in that table, prepare to have no eye contact or any sincerity from the waitress. Oh and we saw that fat dude from the Bourdain show that took him around Montreal sitting at the bar."

We  usually find something healthy in a menu, but here there's not one ( maybe the endive salad) menu that's not going to give you high cholesterol or clogged arteries. The place is packed and loud. I guess everybody loves this place. It is highly rated an was part of Eater Montreal. I will give three stars for the service, even its so busy the wait staff were attentive and nice. Actually my husband liked the poutine. The highly talked about ""duck in the can"" is overrated. Not a fan of it. Anyway, if you want to try this place, just be ready to walk home to walked off all the fat and calories."

Quite possibly the best food i've ever had, and none of it was things I would usually order. Don't pick for yourself, just ask your server. They KNOW what genius they are serving and will take good care of you. We asked, and ended up getting something that wasn't even on the menu and was prepared table-side; a foie gras and mushroom risotto prepared in a parmesean cheese wheel. It was rich and delicious and enough food for 4 people! (not that we'd have shared....) We forgot to make our reservation before travelling to Montreal, so I was sure we wouldn't get in. They said they could fit us in at 11:30 pm. That's REALLY late for dinner, we thought, but when were we going to be in Montreal again? This and Joe Beef (which was closed for construction) were at the top of our list. So- we took the reservation. Just a warning- there are almost not bars on the street that this restaurant is on, so if you arrive early for your reservation planning on bar hopping, you'll be out of luck like we were. We ended up checking in an hour early, and they actually got us in by 10:45. The next hour was truly remarkable, and one of our best experiences in Montreal. (My *only* complaint was that the creme brulee was a bit charred, and the top was not warm. It was definitely prepared ahead of time and whoever fired the top was in a hurry. Totally understandable, and a very minor complaint, but at this level of Fantastic it's worth mentioning.)"
/user_details?userid=FVErH8rPFGcKloga-RwLzA,FM M.,"Burlington, VT",3 star rating,"Went for a special occasion dinner. The space is very loud and crowded. As an English speaker I was a bit disappointed by the service staff's ability to explain dishes (the menu is very non-descript). We had a reservation and were seated promptly at the bar (be aware that a two top with a reservation may end up at the bar). The bar is very tightly sat - and there is barely any room behind you so those with long legs may be uncomfortable. Being at the bar means you're in the thick of it - lots of banging, broken glasses, people waiting to use the bathroom or register. The server recommended too much food - she specifically said that the portions on two of our dishes would be very small - they were not. We're used to high-end restos serving portions that are much smaller. So that is to say, their portions are generous - but we felt bad not cleaning our plates at the end of the meal. Drinks:-Cocktails are tasty but too sweet - as avid cocktail drinkers it was nice that they had 5 to choose from but they were all sweet drinks and maybe only one featured whisky which is odd considering the menu. -Wines by the glass were pricey - but tasty.On to the food:-Pate de Campagne - typical country pate, similar in flavor to many others I have had. Nothing unique flavor wise but tasty nonetheless. -Fois Gras Poutine - delicious FG and gravy. Rich enough to share between 2-4 people with other small plates. -Venison Tartare - we're big tartare fans and the flavored here did not disappoint. However, the portion was larger than any I've ever seen. It was enough for 6 to 8 people to snack off of - not the typical app size dish we're used to - perhaps this could have been explained by the server when we ordered. The accompanying salad was pretty but too oily - I didn't get a chance to ask what was in the dressing but it needed more acid to cut through the richness of the oil/fat. Either way, it was too much food and we would have rather paid $10 less for half the portion. -Duck in a can - one of their signature dishes. It's rather novel to have the duck poured out of a can at your seat. Flavors were savory and warming - would have been a more appropriate winter dish. The huge serving of FG included didn't hurt. Again, by this point in the meal it was just too much - too rich, too much quantity. Overall, the flavors were great. We could have been served half as much food and been satisfied. The service was efficient but not warm. I most likely would not return if I was paying."

From the taking of the the reservation to the food we ate and didn't eat - it was a disaster. (Full disclosure, I visited Au Pied last year - and put off doing this for so long because I wanted to see if time would dull the disappointment. It didn't)To preface this - we were a pretty easy going group. So easy going that when my friend sat down and the huge glob of butter that was hanging off the edge of the poorly wiped table smeared onto her black dress - we laughed it off. When they didn't have the wine we ordered - no big deal, we'll order another. When the carpaccio was drown in olive oil so you couldn't taste the meat - oh well - it will get better.It didn't. In an attempt to appease the fine dining gods, we put ourselves into our harried servers' hands (who later admitted ""I wasn't very good"") and ordered the specials he misrepresented. The fondue was inedible, which we brought to their attention and they confirmed that far too much rind was put in the cheese making it taste like dirt. We agreed...and they left it on the table. And didn't take it off the bill until I told the waiter that he can make us pay for food we didn't eat but that would really affect his tip. After some discussion they took it off and we left.This was a restaurant that was riding on it's reputation and couldn't take a reso or clean a table or even make a fucking fondue properly.

We sat in front of the chefs at the bar (you might find the heat intolerable; we took off our top layers) and watched food in preparation and got asked about how we were digging on the fried smelts served in a ball jar with a dollop of spicy aoli at the bottom, a seasonal special. Next was the well-known, and maybe a little notorious Foie Gras Poutine. And if we hadn't gotten enough foie gras in that dish, it was in the next two. Is fat the official food of Montreal? Or foie gras? We duck in a can - with foie gras! And a dish with a name I forgot that consisted of a buckwheat crepe, melted cheese, potatoes, foie gras (No! Really?), some charcuterie, all topped with some maple syrup-based sauce. It was all amazing and all of it a revelation. Dessert was an amazing ice cream soda, with maple syrup, seltzer, a half-cup of stout and maple ice cream, all constructed at your seat by you and your server. Drinks were the house draft beer and shots of Jack  Daniels flavored with maple syrup. Decor, service, excellent. Noise was not so bad. For the two of us: $178 CAD with tip. Yeah, the food is pricey, but this is pricey food. Foie gras, maple products, charcuterie, and duck should be expensive."

I tried several things here.  The Poutine with Foie Gras, Duck Capparcio, Veal Steak, Duck in a can, Melting pot, the Au Pied de cochon stuffed with Foie Gras.  Everything was fantastic and prepared with maximum flavour.  You'll go into a food coma after but it's well worth the indulgence.  Save your appetite and prepare to detox before and after this meal. My only issue with the food here is that it is too rich.  It's delicious but the dishes were unbalanced with mostly all meat with rich but smaller sides.  I found myself reaching for some of the bread just to dilute the flavours in my mouth, as the sides tasted very buttered up (although tasty).  Normally, this would enough to bring it down to 4 stars but this place deserves 5 because the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food and the inventive nature of the dishes was just unmatched.  My recommendations for first-timers is to consider sharing mains because they are huge.  If you don't eat a lot, then sharing a main is probably is a good thing.  If, or I should say when, I do it again, I'll probably force a side or two in the mix to balance the meal better.  Maybe use some apps to replace a main because it could be meat overload for some people.  You can do what you want so don't feel constrained.  Out of everything I tried, the Foie Gras Poutine and Duck Capparicio were stand outs."

Our friends here told us how heavenly it is but also warned us it could be overly rich. We however, went against the advice and ordered a whole table of entrees with great ambition to conquer them all. We started with the cod fish fritters to share. It somehow tasted like Chinese fish paste deep fried. The cod fish is grounded up with seasoning so it is nothing like a fish n chip if that is what you were thinking. It is crispy and tasty. Then we proceeded with PCD Crispy salad and it comes with a few lettuce but is laden with fried cartilage and crispy pork meat. The flavor and most importantly, fat makes the dish undeniable and delicious. We swept the whole dish within minutes. We also got an order of Bison Tongue and that is definitely the most delicious tongue I have ever encountered. I know tongue sounds frightening but in reality it is so tender and it soaked up all the sauces. We declared it a must try here. Here, we arrived at the most important moment of our meal at PCD. We patiently awaited the duck in a can. Then, the waiter brought us the famous can with cooked duck, gravy and fois gras over bed of bread and cheese. We watched him open the can and pour the wonder over the plate and we were astonished in awe. It was truly a magic plate. The duck breast was so tender and flavorful. The bread was soaked in the gravy within seconds and cheese melted to add more flavor. I had one piece and then another. Then, the 2nd entree arrived, the glorious ""Pied De Cochon"", aka pig knuckles or pig feet so to speak. Chinese love pig knuckles so I was excited to see how they prepare this dish. To my surprise, when the dish arrived I could not even see them. They were buried deeply underneath tons of cheese gravy sauce. The best part about pig knuckle is actually the skin and they cooked it right alright. It was chewy and tender at the same time. The meat is so tender and about to fall aprt. The sauce makes the dish so rich and delicious I think I reached my cholestrol capacity after two bites. I started to regret there is another entree coming. My stomach is already protesting. So we still have the blood sausage boutin tart left. I know we won't even be able to finish them all. Then the dish arrived with pikes of cut blood sausage with again gravy on top of a buttery crust. I managed to try a small slice and declared I am done for the night. It was very good but I was not a big fan of blood sausage. But everyone really enjoyed the dish as well. I think for 4 people, 2 entrees will be plenty to share along with the appetizers. I will not be able to return for a long while so my stomach could get detox."

A little gritty on the outside but really soft when you bite into it. Fourth Dish: Duck CarpaccioI've always loved beef carpaccio, but this was my first time trying duck. The carpaccio was nice and thin with good seasoning on the outside. It was drizzled in olive oil, and on top was an egg yolk. Very rich for a carpaccio, but very good nontheless. Fifth Dish: Au Pied de Cochon avec Foie Gras (Pigs foot with stuffed foie gras)Oh my god... the level of richness and deliciousness was almost too much. It was a pretty big dish, but my friends and I finished it. Mashed potatoes on the bottom of the foot. The foot was really really good. First time trying it too. Not much else to say. Dessert: Poudding Chômeur + Strawberry PieOnce again, very very good. I'll start about by saying that I wish the maple pudding had some ice cream to cut through the richness, but it was very delicious. My favorite dessert, however, was the strawberry pie. One of the best pies I've ever had. The puff pastry on the outside was perfectly crispy and tasty, while the inside was nice and warm with very good flavour. The pie was accompanied by vanilla ice cream, and it was just perfect.Service: 5/5Great service. Our waiter was very friendly and competent with the menu. He gave his recommendations and was patient as well. He was also able to help pick out a nice bottle of wine for us.Overall: Fantastic... If i came here everyday, I'd be dead by 30, but definitely worth going at least once."

I definitely loved sitting at the bar and would choose that over a table any day."
/user_details?userid=9skLwb3MaL7AJbDB6kHFiQ,Derwei C.,"Unionville, Canada",5 star rating,"If you like foie gras this is the place for you. Most of their menu items will contain foie gras, exceptionally well prepared foie gras. But as good as foie gras is, sometimes it is a little much. One item would be the foie gras burger, a beautifully seared piece of foie placed in a cheese burger. I feel it just gets lost in it. However there are dishes like the duck in a can and the pig's foot where it all makes sense and comes together wonderfully. I highly recommend getting the pig's foot over the famous duck in a can. It's just so much better. And be sure to split it. It's hardly a dish for one.A seat at the bar gives you a front row seat to all the action. Great if you want to see how things are prepared and plated."

For example, we saw fresh eels in the tank when we entered so we decided to try the eel appetizer. What showed up at our table?  Three miniature baked russet potatoes with rice on top and tiny pieces of eel on top of the rice, wrapped in nori. Anyone who has ever eaten and enjoyed eel knows what a delicious and delicate ingredient it is, and to toss a small sliver on top of a baked potato makes zero sense. It was a dish that needed some serious editing. We couldn't eat it. We sent it back.The rest of the food was very rich and heavy, but I can't say it wasn't good. The bison tongue was fantastic. That said, we wished our waitress had warned us against ordering three appetizers for two people; by the time the pied du cochon arrived we were so full that we could barely eat it. We literally took about three bites each and felt nauseous and like we were going to burst.Certainly an experience; just be sure to go hungry and look out for wackiness. And if you are looking for a better way to go big on dinner in Montreal, I'd suggest Joe Beef. Just as expensive, but the quality is way beyond that of APC."
/user_details?userid=h4cduDwCH8K9LJrowoJraA,John G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"First let me say that this restaurant glorifies food, in particular pork, foie gras and maple syrup in ways that can best be called food porn. It is excessive, extravagant, undeniably delicious and incredibly satisfying.The ambience is kind of modern bistro, with plenty of noise, activity and young staff. But don't let that put you off, because the food is so worth it. We started off with the French onion soup - the only disappointment of the night. Too much bread and the small amount of broth was weak and lacked depth. Things improved vastly with the duck tart which was incredible! Perfect golden brown pastry with a duck confit filling, topped with a foie gras sauce. I could barely refrain from licking the plate, it was that good. Then we had the asparagus special, served over duck carpaccio and topped with a morel sauce and shaved parmesan - in a word, fantastic! Next up was the duck breast topped with the oyster mushrooms and fiddlegreens served over potatoes fried in duck fat. It sounds excessive, and it was, but oh my, it was unbelievably delicious. One of the best duck dishes I have had in my life.By this point all that rich food and wine was beginning to take it's toll, so we opted for the chocolate molten cake - somewhat more conventional, but really well done and just as rich and decadent as one could hope for.Did I enjoy this meal?

Girlfriend had the duck breast: perfectly cooked, and a heaping portion.The missing star here resulted from our server. The rest of the staff (whom we interacted with about 50% of the time) was worthy of 5 stars. Our primary server, however, was an impatient d-bag. I hope they pool tips because I tipped well, but if I could have tipped this guy less than the obligatory American 20% I would have. With the money paid, and the effort put in to get a reservation in advance, just smile and pat my fuzzy head when I ask you a question, even if it's a silly question. Don't scoff and then try to run away. There was a server name printed on the receipt, but that might be the server who actually ran my credit card (he was nice) so no need to out anyone by name.Anyway, delightful place, mind-blowing food, nice decor, good music playing, friendly waitstaff, and one server that was dick and reduced the enjoyment of a duck in a can very slightly (but not that much because it was awesome!)."

But YMMV.The food really deserves four stars, despite being disappointed. I really appreciate the concept behind the meal and the idea of utilizing the entire animal. It's the service that knocked it to three, as everyone was curt, and our server was arrogant.Again, this place is well reviewed and worth a visit, if not solely due to its iconic status.

Just a short wait to be seated and got a great table by the window. Immediately noticed what a noisy and lively place it was. Started with the prosciutto and crostini which was incredible. My wife tried the codfish fritters which were also very good but didn't finish them because we needed to save room for our main course.  I had the PDC melting pot which was great. The pork was so tender and delicious. My wife had the stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras which was one of the greatest dishes we have ever eaten. Truly fantastic but it was so big and so rich that we weren't able to finish it all. Their Pied de Cochon beer was perfect with the food on a hot summer evening. Service was fantastic and not rushed at all despite the fact that it was very busy. Really a perfect dining experience.

(tasteless pun totally intended) There is no word in the English language that can describe this place. Perhaps that's why the French have such fantastic slang. (ie: crowded balcony) ...sidetracked a bit.This establishment has possibly shot up to my top 3 list of restaurants for simply one reason (of many). Foie gras.Our group of 4 managed to get a reservation the day before... and from what I've heard, its a damn miracle. Arrived early, sat early. We began ordering almost everything on the menu that has foie gras in it. Thankfully our waiter was courteous enough to tell us we totally over ordered. We very politely told him to shove it and only took off one item on our list because we are fat and hungry.This was our order:Foie gras Burger (split between 4)Full Foie gras poutineTuna collar (off menu, feeds 3)Duck in a canand finally Pied de cochon.We started with a foie gras burger and the foie gras poutine. I... I think it's the first time I've ever wanted to cry during a meal... I always knew (in theory) that cooking is a form of art. This meal confirmed it. Such emotions came over me but I held it together because I didn't want to look like some kind of pansy in front of my friends... and fellow diners.When they swapped our small plates for giant dinner plates, we knew we were @#$%ed...First came the pied de cuchon. Deboned pig leg.. Trotters were made in to a fried pate with horseradish paste on top. Then came our tuna collar... that thing could have easily taken up a single 2 person table. I'm pretty sure that collar came off of 700lb+ tuna. And finally, came the duck in a can. The duck is cooked in a can. Simple as that. I got a kick out of it when they cracked open the can and just poured it on the plate. The flavors were unimaginable... and I have a pretty damn good imagination... I think there was a tear or two rolling down my face by the end of the meal. And I felt my heart coming close to exploding. It hurts SO GOOD!I would move to Montreal for this place alone... but then I would be fat. And poor."

Many reviews summarize the amazing gastronomical experience that you will have when eating at this restaurant. Our review is strictly based on customer service. Mini met us at the front door on a cold, cold December evening. She offered to take our jackets and then brought us promptly to our table.  Sophia began the table by setting us up with bread and water. John Phillipe scooted in to take our wine order, and then Chris introduced us to the menu.  He delighted us with a good sense of humor and genuinely was interested in where we were from and why we were visiting Montreal. He answered our myriad of questions and was such a pleasure.  Watching these servers in action was like witnessing a fine-tuned machine.  Each was attentive, kind, and knew the fine art of working as a professional in the restaurant business.  Our water glass was never emptied, and we found ourselves captivated by the staff working together-wiping dishes, delivering desserts, clearing and setting tables.  In a time where the iPhone takes precedence over life, the Au Pied de Cochon staff receives five stars. They should be commended on being one of the main reasons why patrons return again and again.  Was this establishment work the 5-month reservation wait? Most certainly-YES!  Good food coupled with exceptional service truly makes a restaurant worth coming back for seconds."

Coming in without a reservation was a huge mistake, the night was packed and the maitre'd asked us if we like to reserve a table for the next night. Disappointed, we made the reservations anyways.The next night when we arrived, the restaurant was as packed as the night before. We got seated instantly. My boyfriend and I pretty knew what we would like and when we finally tried to place our order of the Pig's Head for Two, the waiter told us they were out. We were shocked and I can see from the boyfriend's eyes that he was disappointed. But the waiter made an effort to put ""something"" together for us in place of the Pig's Head. We had an appetizer platter which was amazing since it consist of tongue, pate, terrine, sausage, pickled egg, and some toast. Next, I had ordered the Bison Tongue, which was absolutely phenominal (and I don't use that word often). The tongue was so tender and soft, literally just melts in your mouth without biting and usually tongue are a bit tougher. We were told to order the Foie Gras Cromesquis, little balls of goodness. You pop the entire ball in your mouth and just let the ooey goodness fill every crevis and corner of your mouth.Our entree finally came, I thought we would have a problem finishing it since it did consist of a lot of thing, but once again the boyfriend proved me wrong. The dish that had quail, ribs, pork, belly, foie gras, duck, tongue and various vegetables made us content. A dish that was off the menu and clearly assemble out of the blue, but served its purpose.I would love to come back for the Pig's Head sometime soon. Note to self: reserve the Pig's Head."

Also much like prom night, it ends up being a bit of a let down.

The space was very cool, the setting intimate and service exemplary. The food, however, felt like it was trying hard... too hard... to be different. I can appreciate a chef taking chances, or making their own way, but dinner here was more like being a guinea pig in a mad scientist's experiment than it was being along for a culinary journey with a genius. Black bean sauce on a seafood platter? Ehh, not feeling it.Make no mistake, everything was good. They are doing some interesting things with quality ingredients and for the most part, they're successful. What they aren't doing is blowing me away with every course... or even really convincing me that I have to go back. In a city that kicks most other cities' asses in the food department, there are better options.As a side note, we did get to see what I'm convinced is the largest lobster to ever be captured.

I would say Joe Beef had the better service but that is by no means a slight against the service at Cochon. It was fantastic but I guess Joe Beef is more of an experience. The food at Cochon wins the battle for me. Far more decadent and creative. I mean a lobster and foie gras sundae? A foie gras pizza? 2 of the most fun and fantastic things I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Also had a veal heart salad with morells, holy cow is that a perfect dish. Every aspect of the meal was incredible. Awesome house beers as well to go with the food. I had 2 fantastic meals in Montreal so bravo to this fine establishment and great city.

/user_details?userid=28s8pE0WyKMuokQJcK5C6Q,Ray D.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"It's possible that I visited on an off night, but what's definite is that I had perhaps the worst service I've ever experienced at Au Pied de Cochon on Thursday night. My table was seated about 15 minutes late for a 10:30 reservation, which is fine in and of itself, but in this particular case it meant just the first of several occasions on which my party would be asked to assume the position by the restaurant, its staff and management. After being seated, we waited about 30 minutes before someone bothered to swing by and ask us if we'd like anything to drink besides water. It was maybe another 20 minutes before the waiter came by and told us about the specials and maybe another 10 before he came back to take our orders. I'd normally chalk this up to a busy night, but when another table in our group received their appetizers before we ordered (same waiter), I started to get aggravated. They apologized for the wait and gave us a few glasses of Rosé to make up for it. I thought we were cool at that point, but then it got worse.After taking down the wine, we received our entrees.  I got the happy pork chop, which apparently comes served with au jus. I found this out the hard way, when the server spilled it on me. Twice. Their response was to awkwardly offer me a t-shirt and free dry cleaning. When we explained that this was insufficient, the conversation eventually spiraled into a discussion of what we believed an appropriate response would be (comp at least part of the bill) and their opinion that this was excessive compensation for my soiled shirt and that we should go F ourselves. We didn't get out of there until about 1:15am and I couldn't have been more eager to leave. Now, I go to a lot of restaurants. A lot. I generally feel like service is of secondary or tertiary importance, but that's probably because I've never had service so comically poor. The guys in the back of the house do a pretty good job, as I think everyone in our party had an acceptable meal. It's a shame those in the front of the house did everything in their power to overshadow this effort with their god awful performance.I'm not going to tell anyone that they shouldn't go to this place because of my terrible experience, but I'd be remiss if all anyone ever saw were 4 and 5 star reviews. I definitely won't be returning, and my shirts thank me for it."

The portions are a good size. The food is amazing. Flavor after flavor bomb. Good surprise taste after the next.-Stuffed Pied de Cochon (5*), stuffed pigs feet. Basically they take the lower part of the pigs leg, cut a flap in it, remove the bone shank, stuff it with pork meat, close the skin flap back & then roast the leg. Amazing flavor bomb. Huge portion so if you're going to get this, maybe not order anything else unless you're feeling very hungry. The pork comes out like braised meat would, tender & flavorful. So good.-Fois Gras Cromesquis (4*), fois croquettes. Pretty good. If you love fois then you'll love this more than I did. It's crispy outside but very creamy & liquidity, flavorful inside. Be careful because if you bite in too soon (like right when they bring the dish out) the liquid will burn you. Good dish.-Bison Tongue (4.5*). If they didn't tell me it was tongue I wouldn't have known. It came out so tender, like braised beef. And the flavor was very similar to braised beef. Very good dish.-Poutine Tamaki (3.5*). Poutine is big in Canada & it's served differently in pretty much every restaurant. And wifey is a big poutine fan. So we always order it to try the different kinds. The basis is the same, fries or potatoes with gravy sauce & cheese curds. This one is good but we have had better. Maybe their sauce was a little too heavy, but then again this place isn't for light weights.-Sugar Pie (3*). Not sure what goes into making this. But it's good. A little on the sweet side but I'm sure there will be some that like it that way. For me, it's different. Hard to describe the flavors though & wished it was a little less sweet but it's still good."

The forward thinking cooking style here is appreciated by all from the looks of the reviews, and I was impressed with the service and quality of the dishes.

DH had a red.Ordering took a bit of time, but we put in for several courses....Started with cod fritters.... Yummy but really, save your stomach.Then had a special, pig heart... Good, but strong flavors...Then fois gras pan seared.... DH loved this one, but I thought the balsamic reduction was too strong...All of these were brought out at once, so eat fairly fast as hot is best.  We also had a few helpings of fresh French bread... Yummy, butter was nice and they also serve an odd but good cream sauce with the bread.Our first main course was the famous Duck in a Can... WOW!! This is a ton of food but all very good..but we did have a slight problem, DH found a piece of plastic in it! More on this below....Our second main course was a mistake, and by that I mean it was amazing but we were too full for more than a bite each...made lovely leftovers though!We finished with a maple toffee milkshake....sooo good and rich!For the duck issue...they apologized, collected the part, and took it off the bill. Nice service again there, especially considering the cost of the dish!Cons... Very crowded and hard to hear. Bathrooms are mid way down and behind the bar, a but awkward and one of the doors had a broken lock...I did report it and I believe they fixed it but I didn't check back.Overall a lovely experience and the duck on a can label now has a special place on our kitchen wall!"

/user_details?userid=awZI2fyI2CZSKkhLY9X5gA,A C.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"One of the best dining experiences of my life. I want to move to Montreal just so I can try everything they have to offer. I know, dramatic. But hear me out. My bf and I arrived on a Thursday night in mid October. This meal was 1 month in advance, so the anticipation was real. We were seated in the front of the eatery, between a party of four and another party of two. the party of four ordered the pigs head-it looked and smelled glorious. The party of two ordered ducks in cans and they proclaimed it was the best duck they had in their life. This order couple also gave me some serious relationship goals. For the last 10 years, every year, they drive 7 hours from Philly to vacation in Montreal and to eat at Au Pied. I was blown away by their tenacity. Finally our meal arrived. #1-bison tongue: very tender and had a blast of flavor. I could have eaten 10 of those appetizers.#2-Foie Gras cromesquis: I didnt know something so small could pack so much wonderful fatty liver flavor in it. It was smooth and silky and no trace of metal or game. divine. #3. stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras: the headliner of our meal was a absolute knockout. The gravy was oozing with veggie aromatics and sweet pork essence. The leg had crispy skin sitting on top of thick garlic mash potatoes. The veggies swimming in the gravy soaked up all the flavors. The meat was fall off the bone and tender AF. The foie gras was perfectly seared and buttery. We ate 3/4 of the dish and had a heavy lunch the next day :D#4. Pecan pie with vanilla ice cream:I never had pecan pie like this before. The pecans were crispy but not overcooked. The filling was beeming with butterscotch and spices. It was not too sweet where your gums would melt. it was the perfect balance of sweetness and nutty aromatics. Not to the mention that the vanilla ice cream was made 3 feet away from me and I saw the whole vanilla bean go in. Who does that anymore?!The house bread is very light, buttery and perfect for mopping up all the sauces.The service is incredible. Even though it was a full house and the noise levels were thru the roof, my food connoisseur was very attentive and did not miss a beat! I will come back to Au Pied again (and again) and bring friends so we can tackle the head dish."

They don't do balance here - just about everything on the menu is a celebration of richness, fat and decadence, so the key is to order strategically so you don't get overwhelmed.Though you're probably going here for pork/duck/foie, I highly recommend the PDC raw bar platter, a fantastic spread of fresh oysters, clams, escargot, crab salad, etc, etc. This massive platter (the smallest of several offered!) could easily serve as appetizer for a table of 6-8 and is a relative bargain at $60. (I had it with a party of two others and was stuffed by the time the entrees came!) What's particularly great about it is the brininess of the seafood that serves to complement all the goose and pig fat you'll be eating later. For that reason, the endive salad is also a fine choice.The namesake pied de cochon is a huge, delicious trotter smothered in a sauce flavored with mustard and vegetables. The meat itself is blanketed by a thick layer of skin and fat, which you can nibble on sparingly while going for the falling-apart flesh underneath.Foie gras poutine smothered in the richest gravy and a generous number of lobes is delicious for two or three bites until it begins to overwhelm. Get one for the table, or make someone else order this and eat off their plate.Also order the side of vegetable. On the night we came it was a delicious serving of spring asparagus and fiddleheads, simply prepared, that was instrumental in combating overrichness.I was a tiny bit underwhelmed by both duck in a can and duck magret with mushroom sauce. Would probably stick to pig in future trips.The decor is classic French bistro with subway tile, dark woods and a sizeable bar and impressive glass wine room you can admire from the dining room. No wines by the glass, so it's bottles or beers. Make reservations well in advance."

/user_details?userid=bb5SGEX1VjTUX3bI3opjSA,Annie H.,"Westminster, CA",5 star rating,"We made reservations way ahead of time prior to our trip to Montreal. Our reservation was at 8:30 but even then we still ended up waiting for another 30-40 minutes until we were seated - but the hostess was really sweet and checked in regularly to let us know they would seat us soon. While we were waiting, a few groups arrived without reservation, asked the hostess to place them on the last slot of the night which was I think about 10:30, and the hostess was able to take their names down.On to the food...Cromesquis de foie gras - basically deep fried cubes of liquid foie gras. Comes with 2 servings - which we were instructed to wait for about a minute, pick it up with our fingers; no utensils; and place it in our mouth. Basically an explosion of liquid foie gras goodness in your mouth. It's a nice introduction and starter to our meal.For the appetizer we got the tarragon bison tongue - so tender; the meat melts in your mouth.We also got the foie gras poutine - which of course is so decadent and basically so yummy. Unlike everyone - I had not fallen in love with poutine but this dish was definitely worth it to have and if all poutine was served like this then maybe I would be a convert.Duck in can - of course we had to try. Neat presentation. The duck breast was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The foie gras is of course so decadent and melts in your mouth. So so good. PDC's melting pot - which is sort of a sampler that includes pork chop, pork belly, blood sausage, another type of sausage with sort of a thick stew/sauce over it and served over a bed of really good mashed potatoes. This dish was good with really rich and deep flavors but nothing that was overly impressive for me.For dessert, we ordered the poudding chomeur - sort of a maple bread pudding, which came out piping hot. Super sweet but I love anything maple at this point. So definitely one of my favorite eating experiences while in Montreal. Really busy restaurant with a nice quaint atmosphere. Hostess and servers are super attentive. Prices aren't too bad - we spent a little over $150 for 2 people."

He gave good menu suggestions and when we left he ran out after us to wave goodbye (and it's not like I left a huge tip!)The family behind us ordered the tuna collar, which was HUGE.

/user_details?userid=gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,Jen S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3 star rating,"Hmmmm...what can I say about this place? Well, I will start of with the positives: the food, of course. The majority of the menu items are incredibly rich and the portion sizes are pretty big, so be careful when ordering. If you like foie gras and dishes like poutine and boudin (blood sausage) then you must try this restaurant. Even if those things are not too your liking, there are several lighter items on the menu. In fact, the tomato tart and marinated herring appetizers were our favorites of the night. Other items we ordered included the happy pork chops, boudin tart, PDC mashed potatoes.The happy pork chops were two ginormous pork chops. Nothing special or terrible, but compared to the appetizers we ordered, it seemed kind of plain. The boudin tart had the same flakey crust as the tomato tart, but again the serving size is HUGE, so along with the richness of the sausage, it almost became a chore to eat this. The PDC mashed potatoes are just mashed potatoes with lots of cream, butter, and garlic. All the negatives had to do with the service and décor. The hostess that particular evening was having a bad day I think, she was very brusque. Showing up on time and letting her know of our 9:30 reservation, she gives me a look of contempt, says ""ok,"" and then walks off. We were left outside waiting without any update for about 15 minutes and finally seated about 10:30 pm. Once seated, we had to wait for our waiter who seemed more intent on helping the boisterous patrons at the bar and of course wait for the food, about 45 minutes. What about some bread until our orders arrive? Good question. Well, the bread is fresh baked and of course they ran out and had to make more. So much for planning and execution. There was a live tank with shellfish, but I couldn't find anything like that on the menu. I guess I didn't give the super secret handshake to get the special menu. Maybe the waiter had mentioned the specials of the day which included a shellfish dish, but I couldn't hear. Which brings me to my biggest gripe: the décor. Concrete walls and floors, hardwood tables, and of course loud house music playing in the background and bouncing off everything. My girlfriend had to shout across our small two person table in order for me to hear her. I guess the restaurant was trying to be modern and hip with the loud music, open kitchen, and unfinished interiors.So if you can put up with the somewhat rude service, long waits, and hate your sense of hearing, then the food is definitely worth trying."

We did go in with high expectations because this is highly rated in yelp. Also was recommended in the American Airline destination guide. We ordered the specials- meatloaf topped with a tiny piece of foie gras and the pork chip with mushrooms. Very disappointed with both dishes. The pork chop was way undercooked with blood dripping. And a big piece of fat surrounded the whole chop. We asked that to be redone and the chef said it is not possible. Eating pork raw like that will definitely risk having parasites. No way! We asked to replace with the bison ribs. The server was nice about it.  The ribs turned out ok but really ordinary tasting. Too sweet from BBQ sauce. The meatloaf was wayyyyy too salty. I honestly didn't care for it. Hard to swallow but we didn't want to seem like we are complainers so I just let that go. The foie gras was a tiny piece and was also not done well. Still saw some red with fiber inside. Again didn't complain but sorely miss expectations. They brought us duck fat fries to compensate for my hubby's undone pork chop. That was nice gesture. That was the only thing barely pass. Oh the foie gras croquet appetizer was ok. Not as good as it was hyped up.

I guess everyone watched the episode with Anthony Bourdain as did it so of course I rsvp! The pack and bustling restaurant was in full swing. People running food to tables and the line out the door at reception all clamoring to get a table.  If you didn't have a rsvp on the night we went, you didn't have a chance. They were running a bit behind. We were seat 30 minutes after our reservation at 10pm. The packed restaurant service was a bit slowish but overall friendly. We weren't in a rush but the host did eventually make his way to our table. We ordered a beer to start off which came fairly quickly and water was always topped off. We wanted to start with the foie gras Cromesquis but it never showed up. Thankfully, the Bison Temakii which was veal on the night we went was very good. Excellent flavors and a nice start to the meal in addition to the amuse bouche. The melting pot is a pot full of goodness with different selections of pork and boudin on top of the creamiest, velvet smooth mashed potatoes I've ever had. My table mate wanted a second helping because it was that good. The pork chop was moist, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our order of side vegetables never came but we remembered to inquire about it unlike the foie gras. Once it did appear, the medley of root vegetables was a perfect accompaniment to the meal as the meal could use some greens but it would have to do.While I don't usually eat this late with the meal finishing at 1am! The meal was satisfyingly good. Nothing was over seasoned and I have to admit the mashed potato was darn amazing.  Even with the wait, missing orders Au Pied du Couchon is impressive and certainly one not to miss if you are in Montreal and a carnivore."

The foie gras really elevated the poutine and made it really rich / guilty tasting.  - Happy Pork Chop: Au Pied de Cochon translates to pig feet so I figured that pork was the thing to get (I guessed wrong).  The pork chops were good, but there was nothing special about them. - Boudin Tart (blood sausage in a tart): this was an absolute surprise (AKA the unintended hit).  The tart resembled a deep dish pizza crust stuffed with cheese, mustard, and perfectly under baked so the dough was fluffy and wet.  I just wished I had more room after dissecting the pork chop.   My only regret was I wished I had ordered the duck in a can - that's definitely not going to be found on a lot of menus."

I simply do not. You might say ""why go to PDC?"" I thought I like a rich buttery flavourful meal once in a while but PDC is simply over the top for me. I ate the foie gras and boudin tart. I could only finish 1/3 of the pie at the restaurant and took the rest back to our hotel for lunch the next day. But the tart bested me even in a second attempt! I couldn't even fully finish the leftovers. We also tried skatefish special (too buttery) and poutine temaki (good but nothing that wow's me). I can see why many here love PDC but it is not the place for me.That being said, service is very friendly and good here. All the servers are bilingual as many people are in Montreal. I made a reservation for Valentine's Day via email and received a prompt reply and confirmation the same day. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table when we arrived.

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So my first review was horrible... I hated the place. The mistake I made the last time I ate there was trying their popular foie gras dishes. Truth be told: I don't like foie gras! At all! Naturally... That made me dislike every dish I tried. I just find that fatty metal taste unbearable.So I decided to give this place a second chance. The waitress suggested pig intestines  and veal testicle as specials of the day. I am sorry but NO! I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would eat that, or beef tongue for that matter.So I stuck with dishes that appealed to my simple self: cod fritters, lobster sundae and guinea hen. The fritters were good... But the  sundae and the hen were absolutely marvellous and perfect. Un vrai chef d'oeuvre!!So I changed my mind... This restaurant deserves all the praises it receives as long as you order things that appeal to YOU and not necessarily the popular choices.Enjoy!"

Yet when I got to the restaurant a lot of tables were open. Sitting at the bar was uncomfortable. The waiters and barstaff are working, splashing water and ice around (sometimes it lands on you). Sometimes they forget and let out a swear and it just makes for a feeling like you're seated in the back of a kitchen. Highly unpleasant seating, would not recommend accepting anything less than a table out front. As the evening heats up waitstaff are constantly bumping you as they pass by, no matter how much you scooch in. This place could have redeemed itself on the basis of good food. Alas. They are of the unfortunate school of restaurants who think more food = better. NO. More of mediocre food is just a lot of mediocre food. The PDC cut, for example, was raw in the middle and hard to saw through. You would think something named ""PDC cut"" would fall off the bone and be cooked all the way through. Alas. The blood sausage tort was more of an enormous pizza with blood sausage chunks on top. It was very delicious, but the presentation was lacking, the portion much too enormous. The PDC house beer was a limp-wristed sparkling water rather than a beer. I don't know, I wouldn't waste your time and money on this place when there are so many others to choose from. I was very disappointed with this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=t903_es-gp3abvdrIQutQA,Jeremy K.,"Stoughton, MA",5 star rating,"While most restaurants that I've been too in my various trips to Montreal have been generally very good, few have set a culinary standard that my visit to Au Pied de Cochon has. I had not been there on the two previous trips but after hearing even more hype about it, decided to make it happen last weekend while in Quebec. I had made a reservation almost two months before the date of the dinner and it was rather easy, done right over the phone. Just a day before the dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm it.I must admit that I had been looking forward to it for a while after salivating over the menu on their website. One thing that I did notice was how authentic it was; how well it reflected not just the local ingredients, but also the approach and tradition of the Province of Quebec. Anyone reading the menu should easily be able to determine the type of food that you'll be experience and in this case it's rather easy. It features dishes that are somewhat on the fatty but yet very tasty side, something that has helped the locals survive the harsh winters. Some of their proteins offered are bison, beef and also a lot of duck dishes as well. Duck as a matter of fact is their specialty - the culprit dish is duck in a can ($37): a duck breast, a piece of foie gras, some balsamic glaze, some garlic and some thyme, all sealed into a custom-labeled tin can and cooked to perfection. The dish is revealed tableside and is poured from the can and into your plate and the can placed onto the table next to your plate.  But enough on that and more about what I actually ordered and ate.After taking a good look at the categorized menu, whose dishes are sorted by protein-type, I decided, after much hesitation to get the assiette de cochonailles (pork charcuterie plate). It featured some pickled tongue, three large portions of delicious pâté, some headcheese, some pork sausage and even some aspic. On the plate were also half of a hardboiled egg and some corn salsa. At $9.50, it was probably the single greatest value I've ever seen and having eaten most of it, I was already almost full. Everything was great although I was not a big fan of the tongue that I found too pungent - The bread was perfectly toasted and I think that the highlight of the dish was the pâté which was out-of-this-world. Not having any idea as to the portion sizes, I was actually going to order more food as their starters seemed very appetizing and were very affordable - their zucchini blossoms ($6) and their foie gras croquemis ($3.50) caught my attention but the waiter told me that I had already enough food in my order, especially since my main course was going to be one of their specials, their lamb shank. Speaking of the lamb shank, it arrived shortly after and was cooked to perfection; it fell of the bone and was perfectly seasoned. That explained why they didn't upgrade my knife at the table while all six others at the table had been given steak knifes. I didn't need a knife at all; it was fork-tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of green lentils and at only $26, was a bargain considering the volume of the serving and the quality of the food. It was cooked confit-style and was had some tomato on top. It was all delicious and ever so tender, even the lentils were cooked perfectly. I could barely finish it all but somehow managed. In the process, I also sampled some of my friends dishes, as I stated earlier, including the duck in a can and the cassoulet. Both were very tasty dishes and the duck was very flavorful, picking up some of the foie gras flavors in the process. We did not have room for desserts but all left very satisfied from our food and drinks - Most of us ordered local beers, including their delicious 'Au Pied de Cochon' ale which is brewed in Quebec. It was light, came ice cold and paired well with our meal. The service and kitchen were a bit slow but the service was very, very efficient and although our meal lasted over two and a half hours, our time spent there was amazing. Our waiter even tracked and split our checks into seven individual tabs at the end of the meal which was both impressive and pretty awesome. Saved us from a math-induced headache.The décor is simple and the restaurant doesn't even have it's name in the front and yet it's warm and welcoming. The tables are a bit cramped and the restaurant isn't very wide, but you're able to use a self-serve coat check upon entering before being showed to your table. This restaurant is an absolute gem in a city which already has good food, it excels at reflecting the true colors of Quebec through its menu and dishes. Just remember though, reservations are a must, and should be done way ahead of time. I cannot wait to go back in the future and experience more of their food."

I had to make sure ended with a memorable meal, and so I made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon. A Yelp search brought it up as the number one restaurant reviewed in Montreal, and a quick glance at their menu provided enough tantalizing dishes that I didn't question immediately picking up the phone.We arrived for a slightly early reservation, but the restaurant was completely packed and stayed that way into the evening! We waited just a few minutes for our table, but the hostess was lovely and let me take a peek at the Sugar Shack cookbook while we waited. Our waiter was fantastic, super friendly and informative, and congratulated us when he found out that we had just gotten married. We started with drinks: the Pied de Cochon beer for him (smooth, very drinkable) and I had the Cidre du Minot hard cider (slightly sweet, crisp, delicious). Our foie gras comisques quickly came out from the kitchen (warning, wait a little bit before chowing down), and we each popped one into our mouths and delighted in the creamy, almost liquid, piece of deep fried foie gras. They may seem small, but they're the perfect size.We then had to wait a little bit for the two entrees we ordered, so we admired the other dishes surrounding us (and wished we could've ordered more food). We shared the Duck in a Can and a special stew gratin they had that evening. I have to say, the presentation skills of the staff are fantastic, and they adeptly uncanned the duck into a lovely presentation that we quickly destroyed as we devoured the succulent and tender duck breast, foie gras, mashed cauliflower, and toasted bread (if there's more there, I don't remember/care). SCRUMPTIOUS. The special stew had housemade pork/veal sausage, cannellini beans, spinach and root veggies, and foie gras of course! It was perfect comfort food, warm and filling.I had to have dessert, and my husband was willing to indulge me since we wouldn't have another chance to dine there, so we shared the sugar pie for two and the milkshake with PDC maple toffee pieces. The shake came out first, and was delicious vanilla bean ice cream blended with the maple toffee that added a teeny bit of crunch. The sugar pie apparently came with 3-4 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, which we didn't expect but thoroughly enjoyed. The sugar pie is delicious, similar to having pecan pie without the pecans, with a buttery crust and warm, sweet, custard-y filling. Our meal was so delicious, I'm coming back here, with or without anyone else because the food is just too good!"

We ordered the mussels for appetizers too and they were on point, cooked really well and the blue cheese sauce was perfect. A bit rich but not too over powering. For the main dishes, we had the pork chops from the cabane a sucre, lobster dumplings, calamari pasta and beef osso bucco with a side of pasta. My favorite was the beef osso bucco, the meat was so tender and flavorful, the side pasta was in this stew like sauce with sausage and ricotta cheese. The lobster dumplings were my second favorite.

If you are a meatatarian, you will be in heaven!!Not only does this place have an awesome pig mascot, this place is just a haven for unique meat dishes. Pork and duck and more pork and duck and a lot of foie gras, you can't really go wrong!5 of us ate here with a bottle of wine and a couple rounds of beers for about $70 per persona and in spirit of the restaurant we definitely left here after pigging out on WAY WAY more food than any normal human should have eaten. We started with the foie gras with berries AMAZING AMAZING, bison tongue which was definitely a new experience, and this absolutely perfectly and wonderfully made Duck Carpaccio. I really wish we had ordered more of this appetizer because it is simply divine! Heaven on a plate for sure. Then it was onto our 5 main dishes we all split: DUCK IN A CAN was definitely the winner. It was also the priciest  canned food I have ever eaten which would bring canned food drives to a whole new level! They cook the duck and foie gras and sauce and onions before hand, seal it in a can and when you order it for $35 they heat up the whole can on the stove, bring it to your table with a can opener and open it and plop it on a plate! My tastebuds hadn't been happier. That sauce you literally wanted to mop up with anything else leftover on the table. The pied du cochon or the pigs feet stuffed with foie gras was awesome too and I thought that one would have grossed me out for sure! Again that sauce was bangin! And the beef tartare was definitely refreshing and lighter in feeling than any of the other dishes we had especially when wrapped up as a lettuce wrap! Their happy stew is not for you if you don't like blood sausage because there is a huge healthy portion of that in here but it is pretty darn flavorful. And the loser of the entrees but still pretty good was the lamp and lentils dish. Just didn't quite excite our tastebuds like the other dishes.And if that wasn't enough, we officially all had muffin tops over our pants when we ordered the creme brulee that was fire toasted with a brand of the restaurant on top! Amazing!!Man we were all still full the next day, and we definitely had to waddle around like big fat pigs after this meal, but this was one of the best meals I've had in  quite some time. The service was really good too! He tried warning us we were ordering too much, but we showed him!! Even though yes, we really should have never eaten that much, we always like a food challenge!!"

If it were strickly for the food, this place would get a 5 star bar none. However, being in Montreal, the service left a lot to be desired.This fantastical place is a meat lover's delight. PDC creates superb dishes out of the entire animal. There is so much deliciousness on the menu it takes multiple visits to truly sample everything.I was here recently while visiting friends in Montreal. We arrived and were seated at the back of the very cramped restaurant (even on a Tuesday night!) You definitely need to make a reservation on any evening. Our waiter came by and described the menu and made a point of assuring us that everything was on the menu tonight. I thought it was a little odd since you'd expect them to HAVE everything if it's on the menu... anyways. We also ordered a few drinks and a bottle of wine, which in infamous Montreal style took a couple of reminders for them to bring it over.So I really wanted to try the Oreilles de crisse, to see PDC's take on a bit of deliciousness often enjoyed in my childhood. Unfortunately, unlike promised, it was NOT available that night. Apparently neither was the wine we wanted. Why our waiter made a point of telling us everything was on the menu when SEVERAL things we asked for were clearly not, is beyond me. So instead, I tried the Cromesquis de foie gras (little cubes of deep fried fois gras) and the Saucissettes fumées marinées for appetizers. The cromesquis were absolutely fantastic. At $3.50 for two, these little delights are worth it. The smoked saussage was pretty meh. Like a more flavourful, less salty Slim Jim. For the main course, I tried the much Yelped about fois gras poutine. Say what you will about fois gras but daaaamn that was the best poutine this Quebecois has evar tasted!Overall, PDC is a great restaurant and I've been assured that the service is usually better. I will just have to go back and see for myself. Although at $100 a head with drinks for dinner, it won't be anytime soon!"
/user_details?userid=2Cm5qJskx-wtfglGuM_GUw,Mymy L.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Anthony Bourdain referred to Au Pied De Cochon as a temple to all things fatty, porky, and duck related.  I would also like to add oh-so-yummy.  This was our first meal in Montreal and there couldn't have been a better place start to a lovely trip. I booked reservations a few weeks in advance which seemed to be a smart move as the restaurant was packed non-stop throughout the evening. The restaurant itself is cozy and the simple decor reminded me a lot of Avec in Chicago.  I also love that APDC maintains a fairly casual atmosphere.  There is nothing better than eating delicious food at a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously, even if the food is seriously great.  A major factor which attributes to APDC earning a 5 star rating is their service. Everybody, from the hostess to our waiter to the various running staff here, were so delightfully pleasant and so attentive.  I immediately felt an affinity towards the awesomeness of my fellow Canadians.On to the eats:Beef TartareI really liked the presentation on APDC's beef tartare. For a second I thought I was in a sushi restaurant but a beef tartare hand roll makes for a scrumptious appetizer.  Tomato TartletI'm guessing that this is the name of the dish as this was the only tomato anything I saw on the menu.  We ordered this dish since it seemed like every table around us had ordered it.  I love me some tomatoes and this dish was refreshingly tasty.  The pesto in the olive oil combined with what I'm guessing to be crumbled mascarpone was a perfect complement in this dish.ClamsThis has got to be the best clam dish I've had.  Perfectly steamed in the most delicious creamy sauce that had a slight taste of parmesan. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Duck in a can The presentation is quite fun to watch.  While all the components of this dish are prepared well, the first few bites were great and then it became savory overload for me.  But that's just my taste, my boyfriend quite enjoyed the dish overall. Foie Gras PoutineMy favorite of the evening.  I love poutine!  I only wish I could find some in socal.  APDC had the best gravy for their poutine that I've ever had. And the foie gras was like morsels of special yumminess in each bite. Poached Pear with Vanilla Ice CreamWhen this dessert was delivered to our table, we thought, wow - that really IS a poached pear.  But it was the most refreshing dessert that I've ever had.  The vanilla ice cream was a perfect complement to the pear which was fresh and juicy.  Overall, I would definitely come to APDC again the next time I go to Montreal.  Hopefully with a larger party so that we could sample more of the menu. I'm sure there is much more fatty, porky, duck related goodness that I've still yet to discover."

But I guess I was being an ignorant American and thought I could come for dinner on a Thursday (around 6pm) without a reservation. I was greeted at the entrance by a hostess that was less than happy that I did not speak French then looked as if I insulted her when I apologized I did not have reservation. Eventually our party was seated at the bar but we were told we would have to leave within 1.5 hrs. Ok, that's fine. I was actually happy to get a table at the bar which was right in front of the kitchen so we got to see everything being made, that was the best part of this experience. Server was also very nice as well and was not at all rude like the hostess. We ordered some foie gras dishes, boudin, and a pied de cochon, the first few bites were delicious but as you continued, it tasted all very one note. Everything tasted like onions and butter, nothing wrong with that just hard to eat an entire plate of it. Although we didn't order it, the pig's head for two looked amazing (an entire pig's head with two knives sticking out of it sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes) and could probably feed 4 people. Was glad I came since it is such an institution, but would not want to come back."

There are many forms of Foie at Cohon: from deep fried 1 bite morsels of liquified livery goodness to classic terrines and the mother of all pig and goose liver mash-ups: the pig leg stuffed with seared foie gras. One decadent and insanely tasty ingredient that morphs into a myriad of dishes and accoutrement to other culinary creations and delights. The menu is a static affair at Cochon. It's a fixed entity according to our waiter, but the specials change on a daily basis and are all based on ingredient availability. The night we were there it was a slow, 8 hour long, braised veal shoulder steak with white wine and onions. The exterior of the meat had taken on that great consistency of fibers desiccated of their juices and now caramelized like the onions in the pan. The meat fell apart at the mere suggestion of the fork's whimsy. To get us going we had bison tongue in a tarragon wine sauce, a bison tartar tamaki hand roll, pickled herring that bore more resemblance to the sweet tradition of Poland rather than the heavily brined Dutch or Russian varieties. Not a single bad dish, fantastic service and the haunting feeling that I will carry the taste of those meats on the tip of my tongue for years to come."
/user_details?userid=ql128D1dKCl9iNhyJgGY0g,Lucy D.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,Perhaps my taste buds and Asian background is not geared for the ultra rich dishes this fine restaurant has to offer. We found the dish mostly doused with a large dose of froi grois which in small measures adds flavor but in large amounts just too rich too fat for my liking. I cannot imagine French people eating such rich food everyday. Service food presentation and even price were all great. Just not to our preference.

If you haven't understood from the other reviewers, this place is amazing. You must get reservations here as it is so popular, that it is always filled. We had reservations and still waited for almost an hour, but the wait was well worth it. If you are looking for a large sign to Au Pied De Cochon, then you are looking for another restaurant. APDC may be a connoisseurs dream come true, but it is not have a flashy environment. APDC's fame comes from its delicious menu of sea food, duck in a can, bison tongue and wines to name a few. I had the bison tongue as an appetizer. I know, that sounds gross, but it truly has a wonderful taste that I've never tasted before. I then had bison ribs and shared my friends sea food platter of clams, mussels, snails, and something else. I'm not a big fan of mussels or clams, but the rest were wonderfully delicious. As far as waiting services, though they are hot, I did not feel as though they were the best. I have had better, but I'm not there for the service. I'm there for the food. If you want some of the best food in Montreal or maybe in all of Canada, then you must try Au Pied De Cochon."

The Foie gras poutine - yes we had to try it, yes it was perfect, yes, no other poutine will ever compare now.2. The duck fat fried fries - yummy... why not add carbs to a caloric overloaded meal. Why not harp on about dieting for 2 weeks before coming to Montreal just to come to PDC. I love thee pomme frittes.3.  Pied De Cochon - of course we had to try the signature dish, or is that foe gras? Does it matter? The PDC had not only the pig foot but Foie gras as well. It was an experience and not bad at all. 4. The Duck in a Can - Ha!! We had to try it... the sauce was sublime, the duck tender and the Foie gras excellent. We overindulged, we sinned, and it was a beautiful thing. I wanted to walk back to the hotel many miles away, but could not.I don't normally follow Bourdain, but I can empathize with him over Au pied de cochon.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to review it - I kinda just assumed it'd be one of the first restaurants I reviewed on yelp. Anywhoo, Martin Picard knows how to stuff you with rich food. Duck, maple syrup, foie, pork, etc - it's all here, and it's all good.The house beer is pretty good, and the open kitchen lends a pretty casual ambience to a casual eatery. Nothing casual about the food though - this is all top notch cooking. I've tried the foie poutine and really it's great, mostly for the foie - the fries and gravy are good too but the livery sweet foie takes the spotlight. The duck dishes are really amazing too. I remember the PCD melting pot including pork, two sausages, and an unnecessarily fluffy bed of wonderful mashed potatoes underneath. All covered with the rich jus from the meats, of course. The portions are not for the shy - thankfully too, because it's just all so delicious. The pied de cochon with foie most definitely can be split between at least 2, probably 3 people - but it's damn tasty. You kind of want to roll over in your seat when you're done eating because it's just all so self-indulgent. But when you step out into the frigid Montreal snow, you really begin to appreciate it all and feel super happy and fuzzy from having a warm, filled stomach."

In any form and we had about four different kinds to taste, all was delicious.  Either naked, baked, fried  or in a combination, all equally great. Every course had different forms of The Foie Gras and all was equally delicious.  We also had the Veal Carpaccio and it came with a duck egg to spread across the dish before eating. This was also amazing. Paired with great wine and really not too expensive  considering this is a Marc Piccard restaurant. Make certain you secure a reservation. Without one you will not get in."

If you love foie gras, pig, and rich filling food, this is the place to come. But DO come hungry! We started out with the Foie Gras Cromesquis which were croquettes filled with a lava explosion of liquid foie gras. Could have used a bit more seasoning and maybe some parsley to brighten the flavors. I don't think I would get it again next time around. For the main entree, I got the Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras. This was THE star of the meal. It came out in this big baking dish that was fit for a king. The pied du cochon was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. There was a nice crispy crust on it and this pied was placed lovingly in a platter full of mushrooms and cream and lots of pieces of foie gras. Even though I barely finished half of this, I felt it was totally worth it and extremely glad I ordered it. I recommend sharing this platter if you're not famished. Last, but not least, since we were both full from our main course, me and my partner both shared the Maple Poudding Chômeur. This was the pièce de résistance! Simple dessert yet oh so mouth-wateringly delicious! Besides the amazing food, the service from the staff was right on par. We got seated right by where the servers got the food from the cooks. The staff here work hard and I felt there was a nice team effort going on. They were all very attentive to our needs and made sure we had a pleasant experience. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant if you're ever in Montreal. I will definitely come here again next time I'm in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=Uwu72w77MPox942_GnCS7g,Avitania B.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"The foie gras poutine is worth the visit alone. I love the fact that this place isn't pretentious -- it's egalitarian in the sense that you don't have to be some sort of snobby foodie to enjoy yourself. I was comfortable in jeans and sneakers. (Granted, I had to wear jeans with a loose waistband, because by the time I left, I was practically popping out). We started with the foie gras poutine and a salad, which seems odd given the rest of the menu. But the salad was topped with rabbit and a deep fried soft egg. Very good.I had the Duck in a Can, which arrived around twenty minutes after our appetizer plates were taken away. Included a giant chunk of duck breast, foie gras, and fat. Love the fat. Only weakness was the puree and bread the canned duck was emptied out onto -- I was hoping for more of a mashed potato, it tasted more like sunchoke or parsnip with cabbage. My husband had the beef rib, which looked like something Fred Flintstone ordered in the opening credits of the Flintstones (y'know, at the drive in movie theatre, where the server places it on the car tray and the car tips over?). You'd think a hunk of rib that gigantic would be tough and sinewy, but quite the opposite -- it was so tender and nom-tastic. I wish I'd left room for dessert, but after all that foie gras and fat, I felt like I was going to keel over and die. (From happiness as well as fullness.)The only crappy thing was that we had a 9pm reservation and we weren't seated until 9:40. The hostess was really nice about it, though - she offered us something to drink and was very apologetic. Once we were seated, it wasn't that long until we received our appetizers. Despite this bump in the road, the experience was still amazing from start to finish."

Wonderful!Absinthe to end -- perfect for cutting through all the richness...We returned 2 days later and chose to dine at the counter. It was an amazingly warm day, and the large window-doors at the south end of therestaurant were flung wide open to take advantage of the all the spring splendour... we were deeply tempted to switch but decided that we wanted to watch the chef's preparations instead of basking in the light. Onion soup - made with pork stock, perhaps 3 lbs of gruyere, and gobs of lardons in one very large soup bowl.  Definitely one of the best onion soups I'd ever tasted - complex and rich and oh so filling. I think I took 2 spoonfuls and desisted from eating more for fear of not being able to partake of our other 2 dishes.Plogue a Champlain: small buckwheat pancake topped with potatoes, cheese, thick-cut chunks of bacon, maple syrup and of course, foie gras. It was the one of my favourite dishes of the trip - the foie perfectly seared and doused with maple syrup -- a wonderful pairing.Duck in a Can - also very worthwhile for the fanfare with which it is presented.... basically a large and fatty duck magret is placed into a can with a lobe of foie, some buttered cabbage and lardons, a venison broth and balsamic vinegar glaze -- it's cooked and opened and served tableside atop toast and celeriac puree...while rich and tasty, this dish could have used a bit more acid, certainly...Some things we wish we could have ordered: pied de cochon, the rest of the foie offerings, the offal selections, seafood platter, lobster (served with mashed potatoes and fiddlehead ferns).... we'll have to return for sure."

The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.For my ""high gear"", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.I almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good.

Second is probably the best; Picard transformed the pig foot into something exquisite. The foie gras melted, mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned, and actual foot was tender. Overall food was sublime. Giving it four stars because the food was not balanced in terms of food groups and/or textures. Also I wish the staff warned that each meat dish was good for 4 to 5 people.

This place was highly recommended to me and it exceeded all expectations. We had made reservations about a month ago for the bar where you can watch the food prep. The room is small, narrow and loud. Sitting at the bar makes it a little more difficult to hear and I had to focus in on the waiter more. Tip #1, listen to your waiter. He/she will definitely use French as their 1st language but English is no problem. With the loudness, you do have to focus in more on what the waiter has to say. They know what's fresh and how to order. Oddly enough, we started with a snow crab appetizer. Not know for seafood, but we were told the crab season just opened and they had just got a shipment this morning. It was soooooo good! Simply prepared, it came with homemade tarragon mayonnaise  to dip in. The crab meat was sweet and succulent. The dish was a lot of fun too. They served a hot bowl of water with hand cloths to clean up after. Now for the granddaddy of them ALL! The guinea hen for 2. This is the absolute ultimate in fowl. The guinea hen body is roasted to succulent perfection. The legs and wings are removed prior to cooking and are seared and confited then reassembled with a wood skewer. The bird is served whole with carving knives. Again, it's a super fun dish that was even tastier. The bird is served on a mashed potatoes and mushroom and root vegetables. The mashed and vegetables were incredibly rich but it was like eating drugs or something. Once you start you can't stop. Do not plan on going out to party after this meal. You will want to curl out and chill for sure.I can't speak highly enough of this place. Canadiens and the people of Montreal were incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. The bread, beer, wine and attention to detail were incredible as you would expect from a Martin Picard restaurant. Next time, Sugar Shack!"

Our servers were very attentive and did our best to help our friend who is allergic to mushroom... not an easy task since it seems like everything had mushrooms in it. Went there with my wife and some good friends. Most of us had been waiting to go here for a long long time. We started with some cod fritters which were so fantastic that we thought we were in for a memorable meal... it was... but for mostly the wrong reason. Several people at the table ordered THE speciality here, Duck in a can. It was absolutely terrible. First the fatty skin was not rendered at all so when it came out of the can it was one of the most un-appealing meal I have ever seen. Just a big chunk of fat on top of the duck. The duck was incredibly tough and really not edible. We sent it back (and again this goes back to good service, there were prompt and apologized) and they claimed it had a tendon in the breast but this was seemingly the case for the whole table. I had the pig's foot ""stuffed"" with foie gras and it clearly wasn't stuffed since the foie gras was just  sitting on top. That would have been fine but the meal was completely ""one note"" and had no outstanding flavors at all. The pouding chomeur was quite good in the end but not enough to redeem the meal and not enough to warrant how expensive the meal was. The room is also ridiculously loud and the floors by the bathrooms so greasy that it's treacherous to try and go in there. We won't come back here."

/user_details?userid=_t3BJzyGaqr9mcDazYiYAQ,Jenny N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"On our first date, my boyfriend and I were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in Montreal that made Foie Gras Poutine. I was like ""I know that place-- Au Pied Du Cochon, and I've been dying to go!"" to which he replied ""Okay, let's go!"".Six months later we were living together and took our first trip together to Montreal. Naturally, Au Pied du Cochon was on our dance card!Now, the first time we went, the service and food were all great. We had the Foie Gras Croquemensis, the Poutine, Codfish fritters and the Duck in a Can. Admittedly, a heavy meal for the end of July, but we enjoyed. The presentation was stupendous and I couldn't get over how much foie gras was on the poutine!! A nap afterwards is mandatory.The second time we went this past August, the service was not so hot. Our server wasn't able to explain the menu or specials very well. This skill is more like a necessity at APDC because of the nature of the menu items (many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners) and also because of the language barrier. Even the English menu has a lot of French on it. So it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations. sadly, this guy could not. And I really felt bad for him. I'm a server, too, so I know that people have off nights and sometimes things are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you. He did mean well. But all was not well in Pig-Land this night...The food and the presentation of it left much to be desired this time around. The poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate. Originally, I had ordered the sweetbreads they had on special, but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so I opted for the liver, which was cooked well and delicious. But things just weren't up to the same standard as they were the first time we were there.I'm still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before. But taking off one star overall. I know that they can do better. APDC is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras. Hopefully, if we go back again, I can add that extra star and make it a 5!"

Obesity and deliciousness are in a direct relationship at Au Pied de Cochon!The bread that starts the meal sets the tone. Still warm from the oven with a crunchy crust and a chewy crumb, the butter was just a bonus. It was so good, we had to have a second loaf!For appetizers, the Cochonnailles Platter is great for sharing and recommended if you want to try a variety of tastes. It was also a good value and came with baguette toast points, 3 different types of pates/terrines, slices of bison tongue, and their homemade beer jelly! The Tomato Tartlet which sounds like it might have the possibility of being light will fake you out. 3 thin slices of tomato sat upon a thick layer of melted cheese and puff pastry.Moving on to the entrees, again, if you want to try a variety of tastes I highly recommend the PDC Melting Pot. Served in a staub pot, it was a thick stew of pork belly, pork sausage, and boudin noir all served over smooth, buttery mashed potatoes. For me, the show stopper was the boudin noir which was warmly seasoned and almost creamy inside. I ended up smearing the blood sausage and mashed potatoes on top of the previously mentioned bread. I am a master of obesity.Less recommended is the Duck Magret. While it was a generous portion and the duck cooked correctly medium rare, the sauce was way too salty.And you know I couldn't leave without dessert! The Lemon Meringue was cute and tart enough to cut through the heavy meal, but I'm still upset the waiter forgot my coffee.Thankfully the rest of my trip included lots of walking. But after spending the weekend in Montreal, I'm not surprised why Montrealers eat like this... winter is coming!"

Yes, he went to this restaurant and had almost everything on the menu. Because of the episode, I took it as an omen and put it down as a must try. After all, I admire Bourdain's sense of adventure and trust his palate that has taken him all over the world so the fact that he got really stuffed here, it must be good. And I (or he?) was right.This restaurant, in my opinion, does not serve your fancy gourmet. It is a bit of french country with a whole lot of boldness in using unusual ingredients. I loved my chicken hearts salad with the perrrrrfectly soft boiled eggs. The pickled bison tongue had a well-balanced acid bite that savors your appetite and wanting for more. The entrees were decadent. My boyfriend had an amazing lamb shank and he couldn't resist the fries in duck fat. As for me, I took the duck in a can. Foie gras, duck fat and breast, balsamic and red wine reduction, and thyme all cook in a can. When served, the waiter comes with a can opener and then pour it on top of a nicely toasted butter brioche. It's a lot of yummy gooey duck fat in a can and I can attest that it taste even better the next day. Service is great and they are people that knows and proud of their food. They also have a great wine and beer list. It is a very good restaurant and I love that they don't serve your typical food. If you're looking for a culinary experience and adventurous eating, this is one of the best concepts out there. Don't trust me? Just ask the hundreds of people that are eating there until midnight on a weekday.PS don't forget to check out the bathrooms. It has a TV and a gigantic sink.

I started to feel my stomach getting full but knew I had to persevere, the main entree hadn't arrived yet. So on to the poutine, french fries, gravy, cheese and buttery foie gras. And for the final dish duck in a can. Sounds strange but it was wonderful.The service was great. Next visit to Montreal I'm ordering the pig head confit. Yes an entire head brought to the table to enjoy. Can't wait to go back."

The menu isn't very descriptive but it doesn't need to be the food speaks for itself. The service was fantastic also. We shared the veal, duck in a can, tartare and boar rib - wow. Duck in a can is quite an experience haha they just open the can of their duck breast with foie gras and this delicious sauce and pour it over cauliflower purée.. I mean there are just no words honestly. The veal was probably my favorite it was seasoned to perfection. They also just opened a food truck so keep an eye out for that one. If you are in Montreal you absolutely cannot miss this one."

Fois grad burger is ridiculously decadent, a little hard to finish. With that burger, prepared to get messy! There was olive oil down to my forearms by the end. Duck fat fries were definitely not worth the price, tasted like very average fries at most. Service was a little unfriendly, but it was very close to closing."

A restaurant that serves foie gras in over half it's menu? Hell yes. I knew very little about the restaurant before coming but was to follow truly blew me out of the water. I came with 3 friends and here is the breakdown of our meal: Foie Gras Cromesquis - As my friend described it, ""meat gushers"". The crunchy outer layer gave way to a liquid burst of duck fat and liver. Foie gras poutine - In my opinion, the must have of the night. I had tried poutine in other places, but the duck based gravy was truly amazing. I smothered the bread we had in it. And the seared foie gras on top was icing on the cake. Bison Tongue - Lightly seared then sliced n covered in a cream and brown sauce. The texture was soft and chewy. A nice light appetizer dish. PDC Melting Pot - This was probably the least impressive, although the flavoring was amazing and I loved the mashed potatoes, it was relatively simple compared to the others. If you're a fan of sausage I'd recommend this one. It also comes with blood sausage which was a little too dense for me but unique nonetheless.Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras - The main event. This thing is huge! (TWSS) They cut up and season the pork meat, stuff it back into the skin and pin it back up. Top that with seared Foie Gras and put it in a bed of mashed potatoes.  The meat was super tender and the skin was lightly breaded for a crisp texture. This dish is gluttony at its best, but amazingly, the flavor is still light enough to keep wanting more.Venison and bison tartare - Wow. The tart and slightly sweet marinade they used complimented the gaminess so well that even my friend who isn't into gamy meats liked this dish. By this time we were super full but it was light enough to try a few bites. Sugar Pie for 2 - Actually, this was good for 4 of us. It came a la mode. The pie crust was delicate and crisp and the sweet filling was balanced by the vanilla ice cream. A great cherry on top of an amazing meal. Being tourists, we over ordered but our waitress let us know that we probably couldn't finish everything so we dropped one dish. Good thing she did because we could barely stomach another bite after this feast. We had enough for leftovers the next morning which surprisingly tasted good even without microwaving. As for the ambiance, it's very laid back and the waiters are all very attentive and great at their jobs. If I had another chance, I'd definitely come back! One of the best meals of my lifetime"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"On the opening day of the project, I had the chance to head to Victoria Square to try out Camion Au Pied de Cochon. Now I realize that this will be the 4th post I write about Au Pied de Cochon and its various off spring. The reason is quite simple... I love them that much! The concept they are going for is salty and sweet. You order in the front and from there, you pick up your items from either the salty window and the sweet window. The menu is an blend of dishes from the Duluth restaurant, the Sugar Shack and some unique truck items. I went for their big combo option with an added item. That item was a fried duck leg with maple syrup BBQ sauce. Anyone who went to the Sugar Shack this past spring got a taste of this particular item. Nice tangy BBQ on top of some great duck. Nice crispy exterior while still keeping some moistness inside. Great option for only 3$!The combo box itself contained four times - a maple soda, a foie gras poutine, a ""beigne Cochon"" and a ""beigne sucré"". The maple soda was nice and refreshing with just the right amount of maple syrup flavor to make it sweet but not overbearingly so. This was one of the components of the Whiskey Soda I had up at the Sugar Shack.... Still the best one I have ever had.Next up, the foie gras poutine - their old restaurant classic and signature dish. If you've had it there then you know what to expect. They succeeded in translating perfectly to the food truck. Crisp golden fries, cheese curds, a piece of foie gras and their foie gras gravy - perfect in the restaurant and perfect here.Now for the new stuff. The ""beigne Cochon"" really stretches the definition of a doughnut. In reality, this is a smoked meat sandwich where a doughnut is the bun. Yeah.... You read that right... A doughnut bun. Picard and his team are just nuts man. Anyway, this sandwich was amazing. A very generous portion of pork smoked meat, white ham and pork tongue with some mustard sandwiched in between that doughnut. Great combination as the doughnut mimics a sort of brioche bread. Nice and golden with a good crust yet a soft interior. The perfect way to differentiate themselves in this food truck rush.For the ""beigne sucré"", they take the exact same doughnut but then stuff it with a filling of your choice and then add powered sugar. In my case, I went for the rhubarb option. Stuffed to the gills with a cream and rhubarb filling, the doughnut, which had been perfect for a sandwich, became a wonderful sweet treat to cap off the meal.A very strong entry to the food truck world by the Au Pied de Cochon crew. Keeps in line with their ""go big or go home"" style of food all while adding some new twists for the truck. Very generous portions at a reasonable deal overall I think. If this is indicative of what we can expect from this generation of Montreal food trucks, we will all be very lucky people.Cheers!"

We were told it takes an hour; was actually 45 min. Had a starter but not necessary as the crusty bread and butter is excellent and the potion size huge. At $80 for two it was s bargain. The crispy skin was perfectly done; the meat oh so tender. And the lobster was a good size.. Would have been a meal for one on its own. We reserved well ahead ( Sat.

Our only regret is that we did not make all of our dinner reservations here! Our meal was OUTSTANDING! Because we were torn over what to order our waiter took the time to determine our interests and helped us decide on two appetizers and two entrees. He made sure to mix in light options and in the end we decided on: the foie gras and boudin checked board and tuna Tatar as appetizers and the foie gras nigiri and duck in a can for our entrees. Each item was perfectly flavored and decadent. He spaced out our appetizers and entrees and everything tasted like a dream. When we changed our mind about not ordering dessert he brought us his favorite and persuaded us to come back the next day for purchases of maple syrup and Spanish olive oil. The food can only be paralleled by the service. We will most certainly be back here again on future trips.

For appetizers, we did the Fois Gras Cromesquis (liked it, but they were 2 small bites of fried balls with liquid fois gras), and the Cochonnailles Platter (good but not that memorable plate of pork products, including pate, sausages, etc). For entrees, we did duck in a can, and stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras. Duck in a can was good, but definitely enjoyed the pied de cochon better. Also had the creme brulee for dessert (okay). The dining experience was just okay, as earlier reviews noted - it took a while for us to get seated despite the reservation, and service was leisurely. Still, I give 4 stars for the foie gras decadence and for the pied de cochon dish we had."

There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll try to add some new information...If you were SO EXCITED to order the pied de cochon entree (like I was), and booked your reservation for 7pm on a Sunday... just be advised that they might be OUT of that dish! They are closed on Monday and Tuesday and don't reorder the pigs feet late in the week. We were disappointed, but rallied and ordered the PDC melting pot with house made boudin, sausage, pork belly and mashed potatoes in a pot (pretty good, though if you're not a huge fan of boudin, try something else). We also had an amazing bone-in pork chop special with garlic and mushrooms. The specials were extensive so pay attention and listen to your server. We also had a delicious veal tagliatelle appetizer special which was melt in your mouth good. The cromesquis were wonderful (as everyone has said), but ONE per person is probably enough since they're so rich (they're 3.50 a serving).The service was very good, though at one point they got very busy and I waited 15-20 minutes for a glass of wine. But I was in such a good mood and the food was so great that I wasn't upset.The atmosphere was lively/busy, but casual. PDC feels like a neighborhood bistro and everyone seemed welcome. It's also a  great menu for tasting and sharing, no matter what your budget. Glasses of wine are reasonable and portions are large.Go!"

Know the address as there is no sign outdoors. Gluten free was a challenge but not insurmountable. We had a lovely salad followed by bison (me) & pork chop. Huge portions, quite the opposite of Los Angeles establishments of similar quality and reputation. As it got busier out server was much less attentive. I had to remind him of our wine and then ask for the bill. We didn't seem important enough to warrant his attention, a mistake in my opinion. Wondering if it is worthy of its elevated status.

They were super-nice about trying to get us all comfortably put at our table. We fit at the table a lot better before the meal than after the meal.The menu is minimalist. It basically reads like ""duck, pig, duck, seafood"" without mention of sides or prep. Between the internet and accommodating servers, though, you can figure out what makes sense for you.Ironically, I ordered no pork. With ten at the table, I figured I'd be able to snack on others' pork (which was true -- I had my fair share of feet). I got:-- hen liver terrine: so smooth and rich, with nice sides of picked onion and fruity compote.-- duck carpaccio: came with paper thin slices of mushrooms and an egg yolk. perfectly balanced and creamy. I just slurped it up on the endless supply of slices of the hearty bread.-- foie gras poutine: i would've preferred more fries to balance out the amount of other richness. i almost ordered another side of fries to dump in, but realized that i might die of richness if i did so.i also tried the duck with mushroom sauce and aforementioned pied, both of which were great. It took so long to get the bill that i was getting a little nauseous from fullness and the meaty smell that pervaded everything, but i made it out alive.giant mirrors help you stalk the bathrooms (one on each side of the bar) so you can catch someone coming out and jump in. one bathroom has a tv mounted at eye level (i watched a bit of hockey) and the other has a giant trough sink. random.so yeah - try it. bring a group so you can sample lots of stuff. don't be afraid to ask questions. wear stretchy pants."

/user_details?userid=91Mo2-qrDaZsFC2zM8Yuqw,Ellen C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"If you love the subtle, fatty taste of foie gras, you'll love this place. We took advantage of their seafood season and ordered their PDC seafood platter replacing our previous choice for an appetizer, and added on the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. The PDC seafood platter was impressive. There were around 25 pieces, and they weren't just shucked oysters and clams, razor clams and snails on ice. They were treated in their own unique way. We had chopped clams with a beautiful apple, walnut, oil mixture. We had the most tender snail meat ever. We had maybe 6 pieces of shucked seafood, but they were treated with jelly or had a vinaigrette for us to enjoy with them. It was worth every penny and was deeeeelicious. It was a bit rich though to start the meal.The foie gras poutine was probably the most ""disappointing"" of the three dishes if you could even call it that. The gravy was delicious but it overpowered the foie gras unless you really tried to identify the taste of the fatty liver. It would have been just as delicious had we just ordered the regular poutine or tried all the other famous places for poutine in Montreal.The duck in a can was DIVINE. Beware though, only order this if you're ready for a very fatty dish. The duck wasn't melt in your mouth but the texture was done in that way to pair well with everything else in the can (foie gras and cabbage) that was cooked to a melting texture and taste. It was so rich and so fatty and yet I couldn't stop eating it. The foie gras was succulent, soft, and paired incredibly well with the hearty duck. The cabbage was clearly greasy but it carried the flavor so well that you could very well overlook the richness of it and think it might be a healthy addition to the can's contents. Btw the cabbage seems to also have been previously sauteed or braised with big chunks of bacon. I would definitely order this dish again and come back to try all the other dishes too.The service here is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, informative, and quick. If your waters are even 1/3 of the way down, they'll refill it. If you have dishes that are finished, they'll take them away within a few minutes if you look like you're ready to have them do so. You are seated reservations on the dot, rather than having to wait an additional 15 minutes after arrival. Everything here is a well-oiled machine.Our only surprise is that our waitress told us that most shirts (I know, we're such tourists) were out of stock in Mediums, but the hostess nicely informed us that they had stock of everything. Might be a subtle way to let us know people wanted our seats? Or could have just been a mistake, doesn't matter, we loved the food so much I didn't dock the ratings for it.Let's also say that for this quality and amount of food the prices are very reasonable. If you were put PDC in NY, these dishes would cost double, which makes me an even bigger lover of this restaurant! For special occasions, this place is a must. It's not the most romantic of places, since everything is bustling, it's somewhat noisy, so on. But it sure is a hell of a place to dine and watch them prepare foods if you're sitting at or alongside the bar. Luckily we were sitting next to the fire oven and the seafood station so we enjoyed watching all three of the chefs busily preparing their dishes all night! I could have sat there for hours on end without having eaten it was that interesting.We went in knowing that this was a famous restaurant but not expecting that this was the best in the world. With those levels of expectations what restaurant will ever pull it off? But if you go in there thinking that the food is supposed to be really good you'll love it."

The poutine was super fried and I'm not sure why they brought it out as an appetizer instead? So it was cold and mushy by the time the rest of the entrees arrived. We also ordered the special black truffle bone marrow at an additional cost except we didn't really taste any truffle at alll....hmmm. French onion soup was overpowered by the cheese.

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"Crispy PDC salad:  A third dish I suggested to my aunt, this one was not quite as successful as those prior largely due to the ""crispy;"" a gelatinous pork trotter fried to a golden brown and for my tastes a perfect balance to the bitter greens and bright vinaigrette.  Personally not a fan of mustard, particularly the pungent Dijon utilized here, what ended up happening was aunt enjoying the salad along with her soup while I de-Dijoned the crispy trotter and enjoyed it with a few leafs of green. Plogue à Champlain:  Admittedly possessing a substantial sweet tooth and a fondness for every ingredient present on the plate this composition of a buckwheat pancake topped with bacon, mashed potatoes, foie gras, Ile-aux-Grues cheddar, eggs, and thick maple syrup infused pork stock was #1 on my list of things to try order at APdC and without exaggeration I'll simply say it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  A bit breakfast, a bit dessert, and entirely over-the-top savory this is probably the truest representation of what one should expect at Au Pied de Cochon and while I can't say there is anything subtle about this plate it was much like the Monte Cristo in that everything present was noteworthy; an accomplishment that I personally consider validation of Picard's skill of balance in the face of something that could seem sloppy and contrived under other circumstances.Fried Chicken:  Already realizing we had ordered too much even before our main courses arrived the fact was confirmed when two 18"" platters arrived, the first my mother's daily special of 'whole' fried chicken...and when the team at Au Pied de Cochon says whole they aren't fooling around.  Juicy and plump - apparently brined in a combination of buttermilk, maple syrup, and spices for the better part of the day - what was presented on this plate was a chicken coated head-to-toe  and fried crisp alongside house peppered pickles, maple slaw, and onion rings.  Again favoring gluttony (both in presentation and in flavor) over any semblance of restraint yet keeping an eye on balance what I particularly enjoyed about this dish was surprisingly the sweet versus savory interplay of the slaw and the pickles, both serving to as ample foil to the fried food, refreshing the palate and keeping things interesting with each bite.Pied de Cochon:  ...and then there was this, APdC's signature dish featuring a whole pig's leg that was partially deboned and filled with foie gras imbued stuffing prior to being breaded and fried.  Individually tagged and plated atop creamy mashed potatoes with a gravy of foie, lard, butter, onions, broccolini, and mushrooms plus a thick slice of seared duck liver on top this was pure debauchery and although it was slow going each bite brought me back for more, a journey that ended when only approximately 25% of the potatoes, a few bones, and a bit of broccolini remained - a feat that led our waitress to fetch Chef Picard who'd apparently suggested there was ""no way were going to eat all that"" when he saw our order and earned me a smiling nod of approval.The Winter Sundae:  With nearly 200 minutes of digestion while watching the Canadians and Lightning play an entertaining (if not meaningful) game we returned to the same table and the same server for a second round and after joking that I was going to order a second plogue as dessert I instead went with the old adage that there is always room for (maple) ice cream - plus maple cotton candy, maple toffee, house made salty caramel, a brownie, cranberry preserves, maple nougat crumble, and whipped cream.  Creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty, chocolate, maple, and without a doubt ""winter"" - delicious.Pecan Pie for two and Sugar Pie for two:  At this point hardly paying attention to menu descriptions it didn't seem illogical to order items made ""for two"" and unable to decide between the pecan pie or the sugar pie we opted for both...not realizing that they would arrive with a goblet of ice cream...each.  House made like everything else at APdC and each warm, decadent, and irresistible I could see both the ladies eyes glazing over into food coma status with each progressive bite and despite the late hour an Americano became requisite - free refills on the house as we sat and chatted with the wait staff and a neighboring table while enjoying the flaky pastry and creamy brown sugar custards with the occasional bite of thick vanilla bean ice cream for good measure.The Verdict:  While I can certainly understand some of the criticisms of both the restaurant and Picard's personal style I could not have been happier with my visit to Au Pied de Cochon - it is comfort food taken to an entirely different level and it was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be - it was good enough that I went twice in the same night and good enough that my next trip to Quebec will be predicated by a visit to Picard's Cabane au Sucre followed shortly thereafter by another visit to APdC."

We could have eaten anything on the menu, but ordered all specials, which I recommend: steamed buns with pork and shrimp served with soy and the restaurant's sugar shack maple syrup; a plate of charcuterie also made at the sugar shack (with out of this world chorizo and the first headcheese we ever tried, which was very good); foie gras grilled cheese; and halibut served with fiddleheads and asparagus, an onion and bacon ragout, and hollandaise. All amazing. We didn't have room for dessert, so our waiter gifted us with a shot of apple brandy, which he did with us. What a dinner. What a party. We will come back to Montreal for a number of reasons, but eating here is at the top of the list."

/user_details?userid=B4GZ3kX1TpxJUCkpPqYqng,Vivian L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Very good food here. But beware, portions are large and it's easy to over order. With a group of 7, we pre-ordered the Tête de cochon and ordered Poutine au foie gras, Foie gras aux pommes (but with cranberry instead because it was the special of the day), Pied de cochon and a Bison Tartare. This was definitely too much food.The Poutine au foie gras was delicious. They don't cheap out on the fois gras, gravy, cheese or the fries. You'll get half melted cheese and some of them still in the form of chunks. The fois gras melts in perfectly. For me, this appetizer is on the heavy side.The Foie gras aux cranberry was a nice, light appetizer. The fruit is refreshing and the fois gras adds an extra pinch of ""classiness"" to the dish.The Bison Tartare was nice and tender, although more on the spicy side (there was a lot of pepper). It comes with a side salad, which was a good getaway from all the meat. The Pied de cochon was a humongous dish. The main dish hides under a hefty layer of broiled onions along with a gigantic side of mashed potatoes. The feet itself was good, the entire dish is a little heavy for my liking.Finally, the Tête de cochon was the star of the night. The head is searched with a lobster crawling out of its mouth. The dish sparks curiosity - you get to taste how every part of this pig's head tastes (which to me, tastes practically the same). As for texture, I prefer the inner cheeks and the pig ears. However, once you get to the inner cheeks, you might get a slice of pig brains too. The outer cheeks were way too fat for me. It gives you the type of gross feeling you'd get after eating a junk food meal. The snout and chin was tougher than the rest. We even ate the eye!The overall pig's head was very flavorful. The lobster is a light side to munch on when you get tired of the pig. I wish the other veggies on the side weren't as oily though.If you decide to go to Au Pied de Cochon, prepare for a feast. You will find yourself eating twice or three times more than you usually do. The food is great, and you will need a nice long nap after the meal."
/user_details?userid=4VbB9qS2Xvk-bjAI1bNlGw,Erica G.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Counting both times I have been to this city, this was by far the most shocking disappointment in Montreal. The number of glowing reviews and the articles in trusted magazines should have lead to a positive and memorable experience at this restaurant. What happened was a disaster on a lot of levels.What I can safely start off by saying is that this restaurant has, by far, the worst hostess of all time. I introduced myself and noted my reservation in French... then, in English because she gave me a blank, yet critical expression. Speaking English didn't help matters much. She looked down and then answered the phone. Now, there was no one behind us and no one walked in while she was on the phone, so we waited. And waited. And waited. Then, we waited some more after she (very rudely) told us that we would need to wait longer for our table. We went outside and then came back in, only to be dismissed again. Thirty-four minutes after our reservation started, we were seated.We had a wobbly table that was immediately fixed by our the nearest food runner. Our table was next to the bright bar that overlooks the kitchen. It felt good-busy, not uncomfortable-busy.After we ordered drinks, we got a deconstructed makers mark and coke (they had a lot of American liquids), which allows you to make your own consistency. Clever.During this time of ordering and drinking, the water boy was the nicest person we interacted with. The hostess, our server, other people's servers seemed to be grumpy. I don't know if they just got yelled at or all had a collective agreement to be terrible, but the only thing that was clear was that they were terrible. We ordered the codfish fritter, beet and goat cheese salad and duck in a can. Nothing stood out as being amazing.  It was fine is the nicest thing I can say about it and I am known to positively exaggerate about everything. The thing about all of this is that it took fifty-three minutes to get our dinner, after our appetizer. The temperature in the restaurant increased dramatically as we waited. Just so, so hot. Sweating grossness. Ugh.The maple ice cream was perfectly timed, but not for good reasons. By the end, the servers were actively drinking and flirting, really not giving any attention to their tables. Our server was leaning into our table while we signed the bill. Just a disaster. I sincerely wish this went better. Les 400 Coups was approximately a million, billion times better than this dinner. I would never recommend that anyone come here for dinner."

You'll either be revolted out of your mind, or cave in and binge like you have never binged before.Waited 30 minutes past my set reservation time, hence 1 star off.The service - aside from the wait - was very good. The waiter was very attentive and helpful the entire evening.The food here is very rich. The fries are great and the foie gras poutine was very hearty. I could have stopped at that. We ordered a salad to try to 'be good' but in retrospect that could have been skipped because it just took up a spot on the table that could have been filled with another fatty food dish that is their specialty. We got the duck in a can to see the hype in real life. To me, it looked really disgusting watching it plop out of the can into the dish. But it smelled good, and knowing what it was, I was excited to try it. It was very tender and delicious. Yum. We also go the Pied de Cochon since that's what the restaurant is called. That was a HUGE heaping dish. I could barely eat by then and could only pick at the potatoes and parts of it. One of us got the horse tartar that was on special. I didn't try it since I did't feel like eating my little pony's cousin but apparently it was good.The table next to us had the pig head. It had a candy cane jammed up its nose hole and a knife in its head. So revolting, yet that looked good too. There was no way, we were too full.We wanted dessert. I wanted the maple milk shake and pot de creme and lemon pie. But there just was no physical way to consume that much so we had to skip it.Serving sizes are huge. Take the leftovers home. You can't let this kind of food go to waste.The food was just so decadent and rich. So fatty and full of salt. We felt like 300lb pot-bellied men stuffing our faces for the winter hibernation.

/user_details?userid=YZ-DG4_kC1USODNkouHxRQ,Matthew S.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,"This review is based predominately on the service, not on the quality of the food, which was generally very good. We had an 8 pm reservation and arrived at five minutes past 8. We checked in with the hostess who told us to wait outside for a little. We waited for about 25 minutes until the hostess told us that unfortunately nobody was leaving but that we could ether eat at the bar or continue to wait for a table. We asked her estimate of how long a table would take and she guessed that it would be another 20 minutes. So we decided to wait for a table.  Five minutes later she returned and told us that it was actually unlikely that a table would be free within 15 minutes and that we could start at the bar and move to a table once one freed up. We acquiesced and sat at the bar.  After about 20 minutes, we noticed the first table open up. The hostess said nothing. Ten minutes later another free table. Nothing. More open tables; more silence. In short: reservation for 8 pm; seated at the bar at 8:45: ordered at 9:05; served at 10:10.We were happy to stay at the bar but there was never any offer to sit at a table or an acknowledgement that they could not accommodate us.  After making a reservation more than a month in advance - to ensure that we had a stress free and enjoyable experience - we were sitting next to a couple of random dudes who had just happened upon the restaurant at the last minute and were lucky enough to get seated. Based on the PDC's reputation, we had high expectations. Overall, they weren't met. My advice, go to Le'Express. Two days beofre, we had an amazing experience. The minute we arrived, they honored our reservation and seated us. Top notch service. Great food. Basically same cost as PDC but much less pretentious."

Two, count them, TWO foie gras dishes: foie gras poutine (glad I tried it but I learned there is such a thing as too much foie gras) and another foie gras masterpiece (cannot recall the name), a perfectly seared piece of foie gras on top of a piece of ham blanketed by melted cheese, doused with maple syrup. Sounds weird, tastes amazing. PDC Melting Pot: two types of sausage and pork shoulder atop mashed potatoes and a couple other vegetables. Who really cares about the vegetables, this restaurant is called The Pig's Foot for God's sake! This dish was so tasty.Dark chocolate pot de creme which arrived in a weird, very rustic jar.

/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"The food at Au Pied de Cochon absolutely lives up to the considerable hype, and can be a lot more affordable than it seems if you're aware of how rich most of these dishes are - and by the way, if you don't like the rich, hearty food of Quebecois cuisine then this is probably not the place for you. The only downside we experienced is although we made a reservation a few weeks in advance we weren't able to get a table before 10:00p.m., and when we arrived we ended up waiting over a half hour longer. Additionally, in the bad weather there wasn't anywhere good to wait. Though we were able to look out over the open kitchen, which was fun, we kept getting asked to squeeze back out toward the entrance. However, the staff were very apologetic and bought us a round of drinks and two orders of tempura zucchini blossoms and the food was well worth the wait. There were five of us, but only four were foodies. We started with the zucchini blossoms and three orders of foie gras cromesquis (little deep-fried cubes of liquid foie gras), then moved on to the seared foie gras poutine for an appetizer. The blossoms were received well by even the non-foodie, and if you like foie gras you will love the cromesquis and the poutine. The non-foodie did have a cromequis but as he'd never had foie gras before it was, to say the least, a bold introduction. So if, like him, you don't love foie gras (which would be silly, but it does happen) take the opportunity to try another of the many excellent-looking options. For our entrees, four of us split the pied de cochon and the duck in a can. The pied de cochon is huge and comes on the amazing PDC mashed potatoes, which have Quebec cheese curds mashed into them. The duck in a can is something that's worth ordering just for the experience (they really do come to the table with a can opener and dump it out on the toast and cauliflower mash - you can find videos on YouTube) but it was really delicious as well. It wasn't the dish I was most looking forward to (I was pushing for the melting pot) but it ended up being my favourite dish as well - which is saying a lot considering how amazing all of the rest of the food was. Even though it was only half an entree each and one member of our party fasted (well, apart from beer) for the whole day to prepare for our meal we weren't able to finish it (though we came close).Which is what led to my comment about the price - yes, we had a round of drinks and zucchini blossoms paid for, but it worked out to only $30/person and would have been only around $40/person without the freebies because we knew going in that there would be too much food if we ordered four entrees. Granted, we didn't drink too heavily (we came from Dieu de Ciel, plus for all the amazing food the PDC beer, which we were drinking, is not outstanding), but the estimates you see online of $80/person makes this seem harder to afford than it is. You can have a couple of glasses of beer and easily stay under $50/each as long as you're willing to share (which was easy to do with all of the dishes we had and the servers were not uncomfortable with at all.)The fifth member of our party ordered the happy pork chop, but he didn't share, the spoilsport. It was huge and looked totally different than any pork chop I've seen before, but delicious (and it smelled that way, too) but the melting pot is still next on my to-try list.We can't wait to go back. Definitely recommend making the effort to visit."

My friends and I called in early asking about whether or not we needed to make reservations and we were told that we didn't because there was a lot of space. When we got to the restaurant, we were turned away because we supposedly had to make reservations days in advance? It was honestly just a really nasty experience because the waitress aggressively told us that we had no idea what we were talking about. It was just generally a very disappointing first interaction for a place that's rated so highly on a lot of food blogs about Montreal.That being said though, we were determined to give this place a shot. We got a bit luckier the next day and opted ot have an insanely early dinner. We managed to get seated pretty quickly which was nice, and we ordered four different dishes: the poutine (of course), something... with fois gras, the melting pot, and duck in mushroom saucePoutine was so solid. This was my first experience having poutine in Montreal which apparently is a big thing for the Canadians or something. But since I haven't had any other type of poutine, I'm not exactly the best reviewer of whether or not this poutine was worth it. It was definitely very delicious though!I'm not sure what the special was that day but it did have foi gras and it was this strange pancake like thing but... with duck? I really don't know, but I've always been a proponent of the magic of specials so I would just say that you should always order the special because it's a special for a reason right?The melting pot was the other thing that was spoken very highly of on food blogs and was definitely an interesting one. I guess all in all, it wasn't that the food was bad, but it wasn't really anything mindblowing. I guess the special was moderately mindblowing, but everything else was good but nothing too special .tldr; a bit overhyped in all honesty... not a bad experience though"

It's funny since we just came out of dinner (albeit bad one) an hour and half prior to our arrival. We felt the need anyways to spend some time here. Our order turned out to be light one. Sipped on some fine wine. Then settled for apps like  Cromesquis de foie gras (a little fois gras shot) and Saucissettes fumées marinées (little hot dog smoked sausage) with a side of their fries, made in duck fat. It all turned out pretty good. Peaking at the tables next to us, we witness the infamous duck in a can meat. Looked yummy. In fact, every single dish we saw looked good. Just wished we had a larger appetite.  Lovely modern simple decor. Service was friendly, laid-back but still very attentive.

It seems like she  focused all her attention on her other four tables, willfully ignoring ours. With regard to the food, we ordered the duck in a can and the pied de cochon. The first dish had a juicy piece of duck meat hidden under lakes of oil and a solid piece of duck skin with unrendered fat, and of course the foie. I was not quite sure how to attack the fat so I just ate the meat. The pied de cochon was actually served in deep, large bowl - it was that large. It was nothing special, just heaps of food on a plate with little thought to presentation. I thought the pied was also undercooked as I had trouble getting through the tougher and thicker parts of the skin.All in all, not so great."

We took him up on his offer and this dining extravaganza was the culinary highlight of the trip.This was just before the ban on foie gras went into effect in California, so our friend took us here to make sure we could overload on it...and we did.There was so much that looked so good on the menu, three grown men wept with joy and giggled like schoolgirls.Even though it's not on the menu right now, the foie gras with maple syrup was amazing. We then dove straight into a second foie gras dish,  naked foie gras.Our third foie gras foray was the foie gras poutine...NOT to be missed!Then we had a pig dish and the Fowl for 2, which put us over the top. They were both completely off the hook.

I'm not entirely sure, but it's something delicious. Foie gras aux pommes ($26): amazing.

Fantastic, but seriously sweating pork for the next few days.Tarte de boudin ($17): I ate ONE slice of the boudin that night. Not to say it wasn't good, just by this point I had OD'd on pork.

The Girl said we should get the Melting Pot PDC, it was one of my favorite meals, was Maple Syrup and 100g of foie gras!! then we had the Foie Gras Poutine, also really good, one of the best i had. I really love Boudin, so i had to take the Boudin home made Tart. was delicious! Finally we decide take the special Veal. pefectly cooked and nice portion. We were so full!! and decide to share a dessert, Poached Pear, it was not too sweet. Everything was good, the service was nice too. The food was delicious just maybe too much salty for me, probably not because they add salt but the foie gras is already heavy in salt. other than that was a great experience, but i dont think i will come back , or maybe once a year...i rather go somewhere to eat as good and have more personality into the service, if you pay 200$ for 2 persons i would like to have better service. some other place we would have free shots or free dessert, like i was celebrating my bday. but i would recommand this place if you want have the best foie gras or great pork. :)"
/user_details?userid=CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"For our only night of dinner in Montreal, one of my friends called long in advance to reserve a table here, based on its fame for preparing duck (and foie gras in particular) really well. Funny, because she was the vegetarian in our party...with the reservation, getting seated was a cinch. The restaurant comes off as a lot more casual than one might think; it's about as loud as a bar is, and you have music playing in the background, adding to what comes off as a much more casual atmosphere. The menu is unfortunately a bit lacking in description (I think it's that way in French and English, so you're out of luck no matter what), which didn't help too much when we were trying to figure out what to order. Our service was pretty solid in bringing out our food and making sure our beer mugs were kept full.As for the food itself, we started out with the tarragon bison tongue, which was really good. It's lightly cooked, but not overly done, giving it a texture that falls apart when you bite into it. The goodness of tarragon, mixed in with a cream sauce, really makes this a flavorful keeper as far as appetizers go. The onion soup is also really good here - it's got much more depth and flavor than most American versions of French onion soup have, and the cheese is present enough to give it flavor, but not dominate the dish when you take a bite. The maple-glazed fried chicken wings (which were a daily special) were also really good as far as wings go, but they're also incredibly sticky (you're provided a hot washcloth to wipe yourself off afterward). As for the main courses - well, we went all-out and had virtually a sampling of every meat dish there was. The house cut of pork was very succulent, although a big chunk of it was just fat and bone - which maybe explains why it weighed as much as it did. The terrine was phenomenally done here - one of the best I've had, and it worked really well with the apricot jam that was served alongside of it. The guinea hen (and yes, it's a full hen, complete with feet!) was pretty much what I'd expect from a chicken dish, although I did like the mashed potatoes combined with the gravy/broth that was left in the bottom of the pot. The duck magret was not terribly memorable (I would pass), while the duck in a can was very good. In particular, the foie has a texture that is somewhere between the kind that just melts as soon as you take a bite, and terrine. It works to add a substantive fattiness to the duck meat. Although we were absolutely stuffed at the end, we had to go for dessert, and I'm glad we did. The milkshake is not heavy at all, and it's got a nice hint of maple that really makes it a sweetly perfect way to finish off dinner. The ganache is also really good - with a bunch of crunchy nuts on top - but it's hard to beat the milkshake.In all, we had a really solid dinner here. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the best of any of the meats I've ever had, but they do a really solid job with it. The food's a bit on the heavy side, and the portions are not small - so plan appropriately when ordering! I'd love to come back and try some of the other foie dishes, just to taste how many different ways it can be utilized."

The staff at Au Pied de Cochon made sure our hopes and dreams for this meal come true and left us wanting to do it all over again asap! We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and the hostess set us up at the bar and assured us we would be taken to our table by 6pm. The bartender was incredibly sweet and attentive. She described the menu to us and helped us decide on a dish to accompany our drinks. We ordered one of the specials, the Salmon Head, which was delicious but our least favorite part of the meal (not to take away from the Salmon but it's just that the rest of the meal was THAT great). By the time we were seated we had studied the menu obsessively and long enough to place our order right away. We decided on  Foie Gras Terrine served with apple jelly, Beef Heart Salad, Hot Chicken and my personal favorite, Venison Tartare. My boyfriend is still talking about the Hot Chicken 4 days later... Yea it's that delicious! Lastly, we made the smartest decision we'd made all week by ordering the Pecan Pie, which was served with homemade ice cream. We ate that dessert embarrassingly fast, without uttering a word to one another. All that could be heard during those memorable 4 1/2 minutes were gluttonous slurps, ""mmmmmmm's"" and the scraping of forks on the plate until every last bit of the ooey-gooey pie was devoured. Our meal was everything we hoped for and we will be encouraging anyone going to Quebec to make time for this wonderful restaurant!"

What's wrong with you?!""I went on a Thursday night with 3 friends, and this place was PACKED. Ambience: Too many people packed into too little space. Everyone is yelling over each other and you can't even have a nice conversation with your friends...The waiter had to yell out the day's specials for us to hear over all the noise.Service: Really good service by the waiters, but seriously, it took 30 minutes for our salad (just salad with blue cheese) and 1.5 hours for our mains to come out...Food took way too long to come out.Food: Presentation of the food is barbaric. I know this place is all about no-nonsense-go-big-or-go-home food, but seriously, we all ordered the day's specials (steak sandwich, fish of the day, fish & chips) except for one (foie gras poutine) and they were not presented nicely at all. Mine looked like roadkill...It was a steak sandwich. It sounded nice, but it was too smothered in herb butter and thick gravy, with huge chunks of meat that tasted a little too elastic.  The food didn't taste amazing....None of us were happy with our food, except for the one who ordered the foie gras poutine lol. For the price they charge, I think the food actually tasted a bit too cheap. Also, there's only one washroom for the whole resto, and it's unisex. I was very surprised that they had bar soap...no liquid soap....just a bar soap that you would use at home...Overall, very disappointing."

The gravy was delicious the cheese curds, beyond expectation, the foie gras was seared to perfection. Crab Pie - Flaky and buttery pie crust filled with layers of scalloped potatoes, cream sauce, tons of stone crab meat, and topped with green salad. The combination was to DIE for. I wanted to finish everything but could not manage. The portion size astronomical. Steak Frites - If you like Bison, you will enjoy this dish. Cooked rare with mushrooms and onions in a wine reduction. The main dish also comes with a tall cone of frites. Butter Cake Pudding - This dessert was a bit too sweet and buttery for our taste. We may have enjoyed it more if we actually had room for dessert. Over all I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for fantastic, no fuss french contemporary cuisine."
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What is there to say after all these glowing reviews? Well I'll tell you: their toilets suck. They do. As a matter of fact you'll first direct yourself to the cellar thinking it to be the bathroom, but no, it is behind the bar! The sink is an over sized basin fit to wash children in, and you don't get liquid soap, but rather a still-foamy bar. I'm baffled by a bad bathroom, let alone one which can afford itself a flat screen tv, but not just ANY flat screen tv, the worst of them all: the one which broadcasts golf. Why would I EVER want to watch golf, in a bathroom of all places?Everything has been said about the food: it is rich, but let's put things into perspective: I can handle a full Hooters meal, or a full sugar-schack meal with doubles AND extra maple syrup on ice. Au pied de Cochon is... alright. It is heavy, so eat light before going, but you know, I was expecting absolute decadence and didn't find it, but I think it might have more to do with my order. My foie gras poutine was surprisingly small and I ordered an extra cone of fries to finish the sauce (a bit too salty as others have mentioned). My mom was delighted with her foie gras pie as appetizer and the tongue in tarragon is definitely worth trying! The lobster risotto was huge and, for the very first time, my Dad could not finish his meal, a black pudding pie (also excellent, excellent black pudding). My lemon tart was warm and crumbling under gooey meringue and my mom raved about her creme brulée. All in all a lovely meal. Why only 4 stars then, and tbh I was on the verge of putting 3? I have a couple little hang-ups about the place, the biggest one being the slight...pompousness of it all. oOHH they can afford not to have a sign with their name! Admit it, their customer service is non-existent. Should you try to call, a pre-recorded message will endlessly tell you to leave a message, and then you're left to pray they might bother to call you back. I found our waiter to be, a bit arrogant (although my parents assured me that was the typical friendly European way! Like, whatever). I notice a couple of people have mentioned not getting what they ordered, I'm sure that could be helped if the waiters would write down orders in the first place. I wasn't terribly impressed by seeing a member of the staff dust the air vents above the tables while we were eating. Sitting on top of the A/C van didn't help my mood or digestion. The place is incredibly cramped and ..I don't know, reading the reviews I guess I was expecting to reach Nirvana or something...    and then there was golf in the bathroom."
/user_details?userid=i1M_M32SzNnpTZiLwvzMjQ,David L.,"Drexel Hill, PA",1 star rating,"One of the worst dining experience of my entire life.We were a group of 4 people with a reservation at 930pm, called in a month in advance. We arrive there at 915, and the hostess tells us that we're early and to wait outside. She says that she will come get us when our table is ready. So we go outside and wait. 9:30pm passes and 9:45pm comes, and we're wondering if she forgot about us. So I go inside and ask if our table is ready, and the hostess says 5 more minutes, they are clearing our table. Knowing that this is a busy restaurant, I give them some room and return outside to wait.During that time, other groups of 4 people who arrive after us are getting seated. I go back to talk to the hostess and ask what's going on, and she replies that these people arrived before us so they had priority??? So you're telling us we're early when we arrive at 9:15pm, then tell us that people who arrive after us are getting priority??? By that time, we just wanted to leave, but because we heard so many great things about au Pied de Cochon, we decided that we wanted to try the food anyways.So by that time, its around 9:55pm and we're still waiting outside. The hostess comes back outside and says that unfortunately our table is still not ready because the current occupants ""just started dessert"". WHY DID YOU TELL US at 9:45pm that our table was getting cleared and would be ready in 5 minutes?? She apologized and gave us free beers, which we really didn't care about. We were hungry and wanted to eat. Also because we had beers in our hands, we had to wait inside in the hallway, which is super tiny with lots of people trying to get in and out. While standing in the hall, I get to see the reservation list and see that all people who had a reservation at 930p had been crossed out( which means seated) except us, and people from 10pm had been crossed out too. What is going on here?We finally get seated at 10:15pm (a whole 45 minutes after our reservation), and we're all mad and starving. The waitress comes and finally gets our order, and we finally think that our troubles will be over, and that we're ready to drink and eat. One of the waiter brings over a plate of cod fritters that one of us ordered, and clumsily drops 2 fritters on the table while trying to set the plate down. Instead of offering to replace them, he simply mumbles ""Oh sorry"" then leaves. EXCUSE ME? Is this real? One of my friend is livid and starts to yell, and our original waitress comes by and asks if everything's all right. My friend explains to her what happened and she offers to replace them at free of charge ( a big 6$ in comped food right there). Also, when she took our order, one of us ordered a pale ale and she completely forgets about it. We had to remind her, and she says nobody ordered it from her. After telling her again that we ordered it, she says: oh yeah I forgot and then brings the beer 20 minutes after it was ordered. Is this serious?They finally bring us the food:AppetizerFoie gras poutine: Awesome. I can see why au pied de cochon became famous because of this plate. The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese is chewy and tasty, the sauce is incredibly flavorful, and the foie gras just adds to the richness of the plate(For some reason, they brought us bread after we finished the poutine. I thought bread was supposed to be served at the beginning of the meal...)Main dishes:Foie gras hamburger: Very average. The foie gras itself is bigger than the meat patty which isn't that big to begin with, and overpowers the entire burgerDuck in a can: Good, but doesn't come close to being as good as advertised. There's an overload of cabbage in the dish, and the duck meat is undercookedMagret de canard: Bland, nothing special. Friend who took this commented on the lack of any flavors.Pieds de cochon with foie gras: Mixture of fatty pieces of pig feet with sauce. There is no way anybody could take more than 4 bites of this without being sick of the richness of this dish. After we finished our meal, we were all fed up with this experience. We just paid and left with a very bitter taste.Overall, I was very disappoointed with Au pied de cochon. Having driven all the way from Philadelphia to Montreal, and having heard many great things about this restaurant from food critics to friends and family, I had very high expectations for this. The horrible customer service just overpowers any potential to have an acceptable dining experience here. The food is ok. I understand the concept of this restaurant which is fat/richness/heavy food on top of fat/richness/heavy food, but there are so many better options out there in a great foodie city like Montreal. I will NEVER EVER come back here again"

/user_details?userid=PBZT76I5s3Uxq2ECcL_Dnw,Jill V.,"Edison, NJ",1 star rating,"Short review: terrible excuse for food, barely edible, absolutely disgusting lack of hygiene from the staff. Yet, this was our experience everywhere in this city so maybe it's just fitting for the environment and low standards they have for themselves. This place was just awful in almost every way. We arrived 15 minutes late and were seated at the bar to wait, which was no problem at all as it was our fault. The bartenders were friendly to us but completely rude to each other. One was so kind as to figure out all of the specials in English for us and she was reading from a little paper and a girl comes by and snatches it out of her hand. It was rude when she was merely trying to help. 20 minutes after sitting there and trying to ask about different menu items, this one woman (who was to make an appearance later in the evening as well) finally offered us an English menu. The menu itself looked dismal and overpriced. Good point #1 -- For having to wait at the bar, we were given free snacks (cod fritters; okay)Final being seated at a table with a good view of the open kitchen, we placed an order for the foie gras tart (terrible), onion soup (SO BAD), melting pot (just a bucket of good polenta topped with crumbly, awful blood sausage and a few pieces of okay pork). It was just a terrible experience with the food. Good point #2 -- The service was great; free fritters, they comp'd my onion soup because I barely touched it, we were even offered a free drink which I turned down. Good point #3 -- Dessert! Sugar pie with ice cream (a ton of it) and a maple milkshake. It was an aggressive order and we barelyFinished it but it was great by comparison to the rest of meal, but nothing worth the trouble of sitting through the rest of the meal. What negates the whole meal, however, is this; absolutely disgusting good prep staff. We saw a diner drop his knife and a server picked it up and wiped it clean and PRETENDED to grab a new one but really just gave back the dirty one. There were clean knives right there. Needless to say, we wiped our own utensils thoroughly while we choked down the awful food. We saw a woman bend a pork chop with her hands to check the doneness.The woman who got us the English menus dipped a finger into sauce to taste it and wiped it on her apron. Same woman, picked up slices of meat and arranged them on a plate with her hands....I never saw anyone in a public restroom during my stay in Montreal, wash their hands so this doesn't quite sit well with me. The servers were kind but this type of disgusting behavior negates everything and makes this the worst place I have ever had the pleasure of eating terrible food."

As for the food, it is not for those who shy away from pork.  These guys are big on swine.  During the summers they have great seafood dishes as well (all fresh from the boat) but when you go to a place called the Pigs Feet, what else are you going to try?

Both were freakin delicious. The clams were fresh and perfectly cooked. The bone marrow was decadent. I wasn't sure I would like it with the caviar, but the flavors were perfect together.Also had the foie gras (forgot which one, but it had maple syrup in it) and fries made with duck fat. Yum yum yum.We figured that we should order the pied de cochon-- I mean, the restaurant is named for it, so it had to be good. It was. However, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and by the time we got the pig, we were stuffed. Stuffed. We had to get it wrapped up to go, and we ate it for lunch the next day. It kept very well! (note: the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were amazing.)The service was OK. Our server was really warm and welcoming, and he really knew his stuff (and he was super handsome). But it was a pretty busy Saturday night, so it was difficult to catch his attention at times.A few final things. Make reservations weeks in advance. The floor is slippery.

We sat at the bar because its easier to reserve and we wanted to see the chefs in action.  It's pretty amazing that there are like 4 chefs in such a small space serving up most of the dishes that keep this restaurant going.   It was incredible to watch, so I would recommend it.  We went a little overboard ordering lots of dishes, way more than we could eat ourselves, but we wanted to multiple things on the menu.  To start, we had:Tuna tartare (light, refreshing, succulent, delicious, expertly prepared!)Bone MarrowBlue cheese, apple, and endive salad (I LOVED this dish.  So glad I ordered it; it was different from any salad I've ever had and SO good)APDC BeerEntrees:Lobster roll with foie grasPDC's Melting Pot paired with the by the glass Cote de Rhone-- this was the dish I ordered; it was a cross section of meats such as blood sausage, regular sausage, pork chop, and pork belly served on a bed of mashed potatoes in a stew with carrots and roasted potatoes in a mini dutch oven. i would recommend this if you want to try a bunch of different meats.  It is very filling though; so if you order appetizers you could probably split it). The glass Cote de Rhone was excellent, HIGHLY recommend that. For dessert -- the pecan pie with ice cream.  Pecan pie was good, but not the best I've had; hey I'm from the south...sort of.  On my way out I saw the pot de creme and wished I had gotten that, and I will next time.  But the ice cream was delicious and rich and creamy, so def. recommend that.Overall, a must try while in Montreal.  Will return for sure!"

/user_details?userid=ntwFx9GPEFnSRr9W_7F_Aw,Bob K.,"Saint Louis, MO",1 star rating,"After waiting to eat at this restaurant for over six years, I'd love to report it was worth the wait. Unfortunately, the main portion of our dinner is still missing in the kitchen somewhere, probably between the air conditioner that constantly dripped on my head and the screaming kids of one of the senior staff/owner. There comes a point where you have to cut your losses and just walk out on something you've lost your appetite for rather than drop some serious coin for a meal you've been waiting for over an hour and a half for and could no longer stomach.I'll be honest, what we had was good. Poutine side, really good. Endive salad, excellent. Duck pate appetizer, yummy. Their version of a whiskey sour was world class. Even the wine I was supposed to have with my entrée was an excellent choice, as it should be after breathing for so long. And I know it takes a long time to make good food - I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and they know how to time things out of a kitchen so that you don't lose your appetite. They also know how to own up to their mistakes. And they know how to properly set the atmosphere of a restaurant, something they have clearly lost touch with here.Let's start from the beginning. I tried to set a reservation through e-mail, which they said would be confirmed via a phone call. Never got the call. Yet when I finally called, they mysteriously confirmed the reservation via e-mail, yet I had never given it to them other than through the e-mail and in fact had reserved through another name. The only way they could have linked it up was via the phone numbers I gave, which matched.Next, the music in the restaurant is so loud, everybody has to scream at each other to be heard, driving up the noise level even more and the very knowledgeable waiter can't be heard describing virtually any of the specials. Normal table conversation is practically impossible. Add in the fact we were sat underneath the air conditioning vents which were set so cold they accumulated condensation that periodically dripped on top of my head or down my face. Except when they came by with a squeegee to mop the ceiling, which bought me a few more minutes peace. Then ramp up the noise level with two kids related to the staff who were either running around the restaurant, crashing dishes together, or crying at the top of their lungs while mom tried to comfort them when they clearly didn't want to be there, and we're on a downhill slide.Drinks arrived quickly, salads and appetizers seemed to be a bit slow, but hey, it's supposed to be quality, I can cut them some slack. Huge portions, you're advised to split everything unless you want a ton of doggie bag material, which is rather inconvenient if you aren't local. And then the wait started. Yes, the au pied de cochon takes 45 minutes, which they didn't warn us about, but an hour and a half after ordering it, it still hadn't arrived, I had lost my appetite for it, and my wife had had enough. We're were done. But apparently they weren't, as they proceeded to insult us by telling us it wasn't fast food and it took time to prepare. Yes, I know that, but when our waiter stopped making eye contact with us 45 minutes ago, perhaps you could have warned us that someone had screwed up and let us order something else rather than have it get worse and worse and worse. No, no, it's ready, stay, pay, and eat something you have no more stomach for, you ignorant American pigs. No apologies, nothing, but it practically took an Act of Parliament just to get our check so we could pay for what we ate and properly tip the staff, who had done no wrong.As I said, I really looked forward to this, and my wife, who loves foie gras, had looked forward to it even more, but if Jon Taffer ever makes a series about successful restaurants who need a serious makeover because they've gotten too big a head, this should be at the top of his list."

He then let us order something else, in which we then had the cheesecake.  The cheesecake (4/5) was good but it is no cheesecake factory cheesecake.Overall my experience at this restaurant is mixed.  The final bill totaled 137.74 (pricey).  I probably will never come back since I live in SoCal.  And I am sure the next time I order creme brulee in SoCal, it will be done right!  Cheers."

Unfortunately, the contents of the can didn't taste as good as the can looked.  This was the worst dish of the night.  The duck breast was just ok, the skin was chewy and not at all appetizing (and I love me some duck skin), the rest of the dish was extremely salty. If it had one more grain of salt on it, it would have clearly been too much and I'd have sent it back.  Foie Gras Poutine somewhat lived up to its reputation and I would maybe recommend just grabbing a couple $5 beers and sharing a Poutine for those dead set on hitting this place up.  The foie gras really tasted good on and the gravy had good flavor.We decided against dessert, not because we were full, but because the meal just wasn't that good and the dessert menu was full of boring stuff.  I'm ready to pay for a good meal, but this wasn't even a mediocre meal.  Au Pied didn't live up to its reputation at all and I wouldn't recommend that anyone go.  The next night, we tried for round 2 on the nice meal and had much success at O'Thym (which is also Apportez Votre Vin).  Take your APC dollars there."

A special for that night of pasta made with pork blood instead of eggs. The rabbi came in and blessed the pig and then leached its essence into the house made pasta. Artisanal cheese topped it and nothing can top it. Wow, it was so perfect, I could have paired down to my after shave and done the dead man's float in a vat of it. Okay...I liked it... alot. The pate was chocked full of foie gras, and chunky piggy parts served with home baked baguette still too hot to touch from the oven. The duck stuffed with, let's say it together, foie gras, and some lovely things from the garden, was not as rich as it sounds as the ktichen deftly creates the unique menu with a balanced hand and perspective.

Yeah baby, bring us the room key, we're stayin' here. Oh, and did I forget to mention that the bar cranks out the every best whiskey sours compared to anywhere? Well, they do. The wine list was small but carefully paired to the menu and it would ahve been difficult to make a mistake and if you're not sure? Go ahead, ask. The place has the charm of a Thomas Kinkaid painting and I mean that in a good way. Forget that Thomas Kindkaid made couch art, the cottage in the woods with the warm lights was a great idea, but PDC is a cottage on a small back street and once in the door you are at Grandma's house. The place is simply lovely. No annoying concert volume rock loop to compete with, and when you call the place, a human picks up the phone and talks to you. Take a lesson, A-list America. The staff was causal and relaxed and yet efficient and professonal, until we met Alex, our server. She was a super star. She knew the entire menu from gullet to gizzard and went over the laundry list of specials and described each one from ingredients to cooking method. She was bright and funny and made everyone feel at home in two languages with no effort. As you know sometimes a great server can elevate a meal from good to great as dining out is, or should be, a total experience. Here, Alex was the equal of the menu which resulted in a perfect evening of fabulous food with a great vibe. So, now I have a giant jones on to go back again as soon as possible. PDC should not be missed by rational adults."

The room is super cool, as it should be. Duluth is one of the classier alleyways in Montreal. The open kitchen offers most of the dining room a view of the black magic underway - who thought one would so enjoy watching a young chef make love to a pig carcass. I've been here more than once, please don't order this all in one sitting. The Foie Gras Poutine (the fries are cooked in duck fat) is as heavy as it sounds. However, at PDC, the server may suggest it as a light starter. The Duck in a Can is all things fat. When plated, you can watch the duck fat and other oils battling for room.The PDC Melting Pot is offers three cuts plus blood sausage over a cheesy potato concoction... at least I think there were potatoes in there.The Guinea Hen for 2 really feeds 5-6. The beef tartar and bison tongue are on par with everything else. The only dish I've had that I didn't enjoy was the PDC salad. Interestingly, our server warned me upon ordering. We've never had dessert, I don't know if they serve dessert, This is not the best restaurant in Montreal, but its a damn good one. Also, make this the last stop of the night. The self loathing should set in as you slip into helplessly into a pork-coma."
/user_details?userid=aomkMAGFrL-gD6cqQjB4bw,J C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Alright - the only reason why I visited this joint was because the awesome segment Bourdain did on the restaurant.  This place caters to the glutton and I most certainly am one.  And hey, I just love absurd excess.  This is 'Watch The Throne' in restaurant form -- Audemars, Maybachs, Margiela and au Pied de Cochon.And I was prepared for this dinner - my tablemate is a nurse so that should increase my survivability in case of the likely heart attack.  This joint is Epic Meal Time... in a fancy wrapper.Being my only visit, I went for the marquee items -- the foie gras poutine and the duck-in-a-can.  And in case it wasn't clear -- this place is not for vegetarians (which my dining partner was) -- so we also ordered the only non-meat items on the menu: beet & goat cheese salad, tomato tarlet, and... yea... that was it.The foie gras poutine was sublime.  And it's not a case of just dumping crazy-ass expensive foie gras on some fries and calling it a day.  Duck fat fries and some impossibly rich and smooth gravy are what really makes this poutine stand out.  Bar none - best poutine I've ever had.  Must order.The duck-in-a-can (1/2 duck, 100g of foie gras, balsamic demi glaze, buttered cabbage, 1/2 roasted garlic and thyme) is gimmicky as hell with a slick table presentation (youtube.com/watch?v=vcwe…).  The duck was moist and again - rich and decadent beyond belief.  But honestly, I was hitting the wall after downing the poutine.  Even for a fat bastard like me - the fat and salt intake was starting to overwhelm me.  I didn't get a heart attack - but I could sense the on set of gout.The tomato tartlet and beet & goat cheese salad were pretty solid from what I sampled, but to be honest - I felt bad devouring down sinfully rich and delicious dead animals while my tablemate watched on tried to enjoy the salads.  My shit-eating grin from ear-to-ear and my eyes rolling back probably reinforced the fact: ""You don't make friends with salad"".Finally, the creme brulee is burned high so it's really charred - they did warn us about this beforehand but heed the warning as it's not to everyone's taste.Service was flawless even though they did tease us with some of the specials: ""[Naming off something that sounds light and vegetarian]... which we then stuff with bacon/foie gras/duck.""  And the washrooms are trippy - the little TVs showing slightly off-putting scenes of woodland hunting.Hate to do it, but it falls just short of 5-stars for me due to lack of vegetarian options.  I know, I know - this is not the point of the restaurant at all.  But come on, this is the first time I've gone to a high-end restaurant that didn't at least *try* to offer some decent non-carnivore entrees.  Some balance to the fat and salt-heavy items won't have hurt at all.But overall - a great dining experience and I would recommend rolling in heavy with a deep group of carnivores to chop up the pig's head and stuffed pig's leg with foie gras (which looked amazing on the other tables).  I would heavily recommend predialling ""91"" on your phone to save yourself those precious milliseconds for the inevitable cardiac arrest."

We were not disappointed!We made the reservation a week before, and the only times they had were either 5:30 or 10:30, we opted for the late night meal instead of the early bird special. This was a much better choice! The place was buzzing with happy customers and a delightful staff. The food, alright, I can't even talk about it still because I can't find anything like this in New York yet that isn't unreasonably expensive and too uppity for my taste. But I will give it a go. The pickled beef tongue is still my favorite dish I've had in a really long time. I tried beef tongue for the first time a few weeks ago and now I'm hooked. It was so moist and the bread was the perfect crunch to the tenderness. We also had the beef tartare, whose presentation in itself was beautiful, and the zucchini flowers. Now the main course, we obviously had to try the Duck in a Can, and I was not mad about that. It was moist and delicious and I love a good presentation of food.If I'm ever back in Montreal, which I hope to be, I will be back and I will eat all of your duck in a can and more."

In fact, I absolutely enjoyed it even though you lose a bit when you have to eat it out of a take out tray because you forgot to make reservations two weeks in advance. The thing is this. There are some food items that can feed a family of four. Duck-in-a-Can, while exquisite in both style and substance (100g of foie gras in every can!) for $50, you can get a vastly more substantial meal that does not leave you licking the grease off the plate.

If you're looking for traditional quebecoise fare with an upscale twist, this is the place! My friend and I made reservations 1 week in advance, so we got reservations for 10:30pm on a Saturday night, which I was delighted with because I had heard that reservations were difficult to get. The best part was that once we arrived, we asked for 2 seats at the bar, and we got it! Definitely had the BEST seat in the house because you can look into the kitchen and see the action.Also, that morning, we had gone on a food tour, and the guide had told us that traditional fare was rich and heavy, so we thought we knew what we were getting into - we didn't. Let others be warned, the food is delicious but RICH. You will leave feeling like you have a lead ball in your stomach all night, but you only live once. We ordered the beef tongue (delightful, substantial, yet melts-in-your-mouth), risotto (best risotto I've had, incredible incredible bacon), and foie gras/boudin tart (puff pastry was perfect, boudin was delicious, but I wanted MORE foie gras). Dessert was the chomeur (perfect, rich, delicious). We also had their cider and house red with our meal. The cider is refreshing, and light, while the house red was decent, but great for pairing with the rich food.

OK, I  know all this...arrived a tad early for a bar-side seat and didn't get seated until 35 minutes after arrival...so that makes them 20 min late - not the worst thing for a renowned restaurant.  Another 30 min & no bread, no napkin, cutlery...app of FG with a garlic sauce was good...skimpy on the FG for $29, I thought.

/user_details?userid=YkJ61BgbYEQO2quoU8mcbA,Eric K.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Every once in awhile, you're lucky enough to come across a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's not necessarily because you would want to eat that meal again and again in the future. It's just that the meal was completely different from any previous meal you had ever eaten.  In the case of Au Pied de Cochon, I don't think I've ever eaten a more decadent, rich, fatty, and hearty meal in my life. You'll notice a certain common theme based on the list of key ingredients in the dishes that my friends and I shared: foie gras, bacon, boudin, and flaky crust. Having visited Montreal in late December when the weather is beyond frigid and the wind beyond bitter, I understand the genius and madness behind APDC: their food warms/insulates your body with the fattiest parts of other animals. Let's begin with the cromesquis de foie gras, it's basically a small bite: 2 quarter-sized puff pastries with hot foie gras liquid in the center. Arguably, it was the best bite of the night. Decadent yet light and an amazing way to begin the meal. They come 2 to an order and among the 3 of us, we had 3 orders.Then there's the much hyped foie gras poutine. It will be possibly the richest, fattiest, most decadent food you will ever eat in your life. One word describes it best: damn. Damn, it's good. Fries covered in an addictive foie gras based gravy, topped with cheese curds and 2 sizable slabs of foie gras. It sounds like suicide but amazingly, it works. Plus you can sop up the leftover gravy with multiple refills of crusty bread. At this point, our stomachs were feeling it but we trucked on and split the also-hyped duck in a can and the boudin tart. As others have said, the duck in a can, presentation-wise, really does match the hype. It was awesome just watching the server open the can and extract a huge piece of duck breast with bacon, cabbage, and carrots in an earthy sauce onto a plate of cauliflower puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy, and the vegetables gave it some much-needed flavor and textural contrast.  The boudin tart was also a unique, over-the-top dish with the incredible, almost mineral-y flavor of the boudin and a flaky, buttery crust. However, at a certain point while eating these dishes, I crossed my threshold for excess. Perhaps it had something to do with the dishes naturally getting colder as the eating went on. But, once that threshold was crossed, I was DONE. I realized there was a limit to the madness. Despite this overload, the saying ""there's always room for dessert"" rang true. We went against our best judgment and split the chocolate pot de creme. Served in a jar with a thick chocolate mousse on the bottom, whipped cream in the middle and little crunchies on top, the chocolatey dessert was irrationally a welcome break from the onslaught of duck and pork we had undergone. It was a fitting way to end a meal that will give me dreams/nightmares through the rest of my life. For those coming from out of town, I'd highly recommend making a reservation as we made one 3 weeks prior for a wednesday night and it was packed. Also, plan some sort of physical activity for the next morning/afternoon: you will need it."

As well it's a good deal for what it is, not expensive at all. Definitely come hungry because you'll leave stuffed and ready for a long nap."

YUM!No room for dessert but I did have the namesake's beer which was a nice and light beer to accompany the meal.  This is a must go, if you are in Montreal for any period of time.  Parking is on the street and be sure to note the address.  I drove past the simple facade twice before I noticed the Pig above the entrance.Note: APdC is not open on Mondays as I found out when wanting to go back for seconds. Enjoy!"

How I wish I had the metabolism and the money to spend each and every one of the 1,642 nights dining here...My absolute favourite is their namesake dish: pied de cochon farci au foie gras. I get to have the two of my favourite ingredients in one dish: pork and foie! How amazing is that!? Even better is that Martin Picard being the insane man that he is; debones the hock and stuffs it with foie gras. Not only that, but he somehow masters the texture to make the trotter crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. Pure. Genius. I think I ordered it twice - one for myself and once to share. I've never finished it even when I ordered it to share. I think this could easily feed 4 people.Next time I'm in town I will be ordering the tête de cochon. Also am very curious about their pintade (guineafowl)."

It was talked up so much before our trip to Montreal and I thought I was really going to enjoy it, sadly I found it mediocre. Service wasn't that great, waitress never stopped back to check up on us, and when we wanted to order more we had to speak to the food runner who said she would get our waitress who then took more then 5 mins to come over. It's also very loud in there, not great if you don't know the menu and have questions. Also there were a bunch of daily specials we didn't even know about. The menu has no descriptions so you have no idea what it is and what it's served with. Also we ordered the steamed buns and they were actually pretty gross. If you've ever had a real Taiwanese soup dumpling don't order cochon dumplings. We should have just saved room for dessert."
/user_details?userid=pEMWzZ8qWY1T_K0HUoKDIA,Hope C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This was my second time to Au Pied de Cochon. The first time was nearly two years ago. Back then my interest was piqued after seeing Anthony Bourdain slink down onto the bar with overwhelmed gluttony at the whims of chef Martin Picard - surely the restaurant wasn't as ridiculous as it seemed in that episode?! Tonight, I returned and it was better than I remembered the first time.Two years ago, we got the bison tongue with tarragon, foie gras poutine and duck in a can. The bison tongue was thinly shaved, lightly seasoned and the perfect starter. It floated above the heavy foie gras poutine and dark syrupy balsamic reduction that drenched the tender duck. It was a mesmerizing meal (I do recommend trying all these dishes if you go!) but one that wasn't appreciated until a couple days later -- after some ""rest and digest"" and gripping gallbladder pain. Just kidding.This time, Au Pied de Cochon was even better because I felt like I understood the place a little more. It's a farce on excess, a deliberate play on everything overwhelming -- a chance for Martin Picard, the crazy French chef who created the place, to laugh to himself and poke fun at all the people he's duped into eating something as ridiculous as foie gras on POUTINE!!! Seriously people, there's a joke in here somewhere, and as the meal progresses and your eyes glaze over, Picard has to be back there behind the cotton candy machine, cackling away. We started with the monte cristo -- ridiculous mounds of flavorful smoked ham and cabbage soaked in maple butter and maple mustard, cradled between two egg battered brioche slices drizzled in maple syrup. Sick, right? But just so good. This was followed by the foie gras poutine -- melt-in-your-mouth foie gras with a slightly crisp salty crust doused in cream, gravy, cheese curds and poured over fries cooked in duck fat. My arteries were hardening. My husband thought he wouldn't be able to make it. The final course -- the pied de cochon, literally the ""foot of the pig"" - was totally amazing and we had to take the rest of it in a bag with us because we couldn't eat more than a few bites of the tender pork and slightly sour sauce that complemented the salty skin of the pork with surprising harmony. All in all, one of the best meals I've ever had and the value was astounding....around $22 each dish, so less than $70 for food total. Wine and beer were reasonably priced. I made reservations about 6 weeks in advance. If you are a foodie with a good sense of humor, you must make the trip to Montreal to eat at Au Pied de Cochon."
/user_details?userid=FRj2bwwFoXGodqKXS-PGMg,Lily C.,"North York, Canada",4 star rating,"SUMMARY:  This place is a definite 4. The chefs are skillful and the flavours are rich.  Knowing that I might never visit this restaurant again, my companion and I ordered everything that piqued our interest based on numerous Yelp reviews, i.e., Foie Gras Poutine, Crispy Salad, Bison Tongue, Duck in a Can and Pied Du Cochon.  That's a lot of food for only 2 people - but we paced ourselves and packed up part of our appetizers.  As we were waiting for our mains, we glimpsed some bone marrow in the open kitchen and discovered it was not listed on the menu.  My companion just had to try it, so we ordered it and it turned out to be a real highlight of the evening!  There were some delicious mushrooms on top of the marrow, and I believe there was some sake in the marrow.I hate to say it, but the appetizers were the best part of the meal.  The Duck in a Can, though an interesting novelty, was rather salty and the meat seemed overly cured.  Also, after eating Foie Gras with the poutine as well as eating the bone marrow, our stomachs were probably significantly dulled by the amount of fat we'd already ingested.  The Pied Du Cochon had an interesting flavour, the meat was tender, the cabbage(?) was smoky and slightly sweet and sour.  The skin really melted in my mouth, but by then I didn't want food that melted in my mouth.  The saving grace was the virgin mojito with fresh mint and raspberries that tempered the flavours of the meal.  We left with a significant amount of leftovers (I think we only took 5 bites of the Pied Du Cochon, which was huge)...and then gave it to a homeless person who seemed very appreciative to receive our leftovers (though he probably had no idea how much the meal inside the bag was worth!).I think Foie Gras Poutine already has mythic status in foodie circles, hence, this visit was worth it for the experience.   If I were to go there again (maybe after a few years of burning off these calories), I would probably stick with ordering a few appetizers with a mojito.  There's only so much fat one can eat in one sitting..."

It's clams + cheese + hoegaarden beer. The duck is great, and since you're at a restaurant called au pied du cochon, I'd recommend some pork for the main course. You will enjoy the dessert twice, once when you eat it and the second (reminiscing in bed.Granted, they turned me away the last time I visited Montreal in an annoying French Canadian accent (Monsieur, no reservation -no entry), but this time around I made reservations well in advance, showed up on time in a nice shirt - still waiting, half an hour, but eventually got in."

Anyone who is on a budgetIOk, now down to business. I called the day before and got a reservation for the next night at 10:30PM.   We requested the bar and were seated directly in front of the open kitchen where the sauces were made and all dishes were finished before being set in the window to be expedited.  The atmosphere is animated and loud. The staff is attentive but not intrusive and we chatted with the chef's occasionally because there were a few things we could not identify, they were very accommodating.  First up (besides the yummy bread and butter):  Salad (yes, I admit we were pretending to have a balanced meal, this was a farce in itself).  A smattering of lettuce and tomato tossed with a vinaigrette and topped off with lovely chunks of pork/fat bits (bacon?) and this lovely fried square of cartilage etc (tasted like hogs head cheese).  Not salty at all and a good way to ""ease on down the road.""  At this point we are not bowled over but happy with what we were eating. Next, a server inquired...""did you order the Foie Gras Cromesquis?""  Qui! Our instructions: ""Please let this cool for 2 - 3 minutes and then put the whole cube in your mouth and bite but keep your mouth closed.""  Ok, got it.  So out first comes the dish of Bone Marrow we ordered, cooked with a hint of maple and smeared with a luxurious dose of caviar.  This was declared better than sex by my dining companion (the chef laughed - I wasn't sure I was going to make that kind of a substitution).  I can tell you this was creamier than any marrow I have ever tasted with the perfect balance of sweet and salt from the syrup and caviar.  Can you tell I am dreaming of this marrow?  In any event as we were savoring this delicacy the fried foie gras cubes emerge on a tiny wooden plate.  We want to dive right in but know that we have to wait the 2 - 3 minutes...no problem...plenty of time to really get into that bone marrow.  If we weren't in public I would have grabbed that bone and licked it.  NOTE: Marrow is not for everyone.  It is almost like eating butter.  At this point we are ready for the foie gras cubes so we each popped one in our mouths.  It is completely liquid inside (I can just imagine how someone would be scalded who didn't wait the prescribed 2 - 3 minutes for these babies to cool down!). Buttery, smoky, with a crunchy outside this was so delicious what a shame that you only get two in an order!  Simply beautiful.  At this point we were both grinning (while keeping the mouth closed!) and trying to prevent that taste from disappearing from our taste buds too fast.Next?  The famous Foie Gras Poutine.  I have had poutine elsewhere - it wasn't bad - basically a highfalutin disco fry.  Neither one of us thought this dish would be anything special, um WRONG.  The fries were the perfect amount of crisp (well they better be, fried in duck fat), the chunks of foie gras and cheese curds sprinkled on top with 2 of the most amazing gravies poured over the top.  FYI, the gravy takes about 3 days to make! I just didn't want this dish to end.  I also didn't want to part with that gravy.  It was so rich it would have gone well with biscuits (instead of country gravy) or grits, fried chicken just about anything southern that you can conjure up.  Needless to say, I will only each poutine if Chef Martin Picard has something to do with the recipe.Next course was the Happy Pork Chop and the indubitable, Duck in a Can(Canard en Conserve).  The duck is quite flavorful but I mirror another person's account - I don't think it is their best item on the menu.  I think my Happy Pork Chop might be a contender though.  Looks like something out of the Flintstones with this huge rib bone sticking off the plate.  Perhaps this is a subliminal encouragement to just grab it with your hand and start gnawing away.  This ultra-tender chop was brimming over with mushrooms in a lovely burgundy gravy.  Both the duck and the pork have so many layers of flavor (and duck fat...) I was quite beside myself and ended up packing the remainder to take home.  We also ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side.  The mashed potatoes were filled with cheesy goodness.  This should be on everyone's Christmas Dinner menu. We had just enough room for a light dessert of poached pear with vanilla ice cream.  The liquid from the pear was so delicious I wish I could have bottled it, added Prosecco and served it as a refreshing brunch drink.  Go Hungry.  Leave Happy!"

Here's how it went down...Food:+ Cromesquis de foie gras. $3.50. It was succulent, sauteed and done well. Paired fantastically with our Bordeaux.+ Carpaccio de Canard. $13. Lovely, fantastic and amazing. That's all I have to tell you, order it. DUCK. YES.+ Deer Ribs. $28. OMG YES!!!!! hahahah I love deer and all deer related products. GO FOR IT.+ Chocolate Molten cake. $7. It was done in a ramekin, the way it should be and it was done very well. Firm yet moist on the outside, soft gooey and warm on the inside. Once you cut in to it, it kinda' fell apart. HAHHHAHA!!! LOVED IT!!!Service:- The service was a bit quirky. It's not the level of service I'd expect in a French restaurant and although it wasn't that busy, it was still tough to track servers down let alone our own.Overall?

While waiting for our table, we saw a filthy tank full of eels, slithering on top of each other, some dead.

The floor was greasy and slippery and the bathroom is in the middle of the kitchen. We ordered the chicken liver mousse and foie grois burger and a veal pasta that was the special, but unfortunately, they were sold out of the veal pasta. The chicken liver mousse was mediocre at best. Our waiter asked us if we'd like to move on to the next course and we said yes, but we were left waiting for a long while after that. I asked about the status of our order and was told that the foie grois burger patties were ""being made."" I asked to cancel the order since we'd already been there for 1.5 hours, and our waiter told me he'd go check on the food. He magically came back one minute later with two lukewarm burgers. The burgers were fine. Fatty and unremarkable. While we were eating, the staff took out the trash from the front entrance, passing by our table while we were eating. Disgusting. There was a fly on the table next to us. The staff was unapologetic about any of these issues.

Best we got on reservations was at their opening time on a Saturday, which was ok for us. It was his second time to the restaurant.Up front you should know, as other reviewers have written, that the noise level is very high so don't count on Au Pied de Cochon for that quiet romantic candle lit dinner, perhaps mid week is a lot different. We were seated at window - was a little chilly in this location so perhaps you could ascertain your seating when you make the reservation.Anyway the good was excellent. I'm probably not going to be as generous as many other reviewers because there are simply too many great restaurants in Montreal that are on the same, or even that bit higher level in my estimation in terms of taste of food, presentation, price, ambiance and well overall friendliness of staff. It was my very first try of Foie Gras - nice but sinfully bad for you. The Duck in a Can, again was delicious, however I think the presentation was the selling point for me as I'd seen it on Anthony Bourdain show. The wine list...good but on a personal note was pricey for me.About the floor - beware - twice I slipped coming and going to the bathroom. Not pleasant when you grab another a patron in a jam packed restaurant to hold you up. It was the same for many people. Note to management - take care of your grease problem on the floor.

The Foie Gras Cromesquis, were delicious and exploded with juicy fatness; the apple foie gras was savory, succulent and crispy (and the most well balanced (buttery, salty, sweet, squishy, firm, textured, silky, rich) entree of the night); the duck-in-a-can released a barrage of aromas, followed by more flavors of sin; and the veal, which was incredible on its own, had a bitter green herb that resulted in an unpleasantly acrid reduction (but was easy enough to avoid). Overall it was an exceptional meal. Our only complaint was that the wine we had was our only method of cutting the richness. An amuse bouche just prior to the main courses would have opened things up nicely. A minor complaint, though, and a good excuse to just drink more red wine.

Our reservations were lost however the hostess was exceptionally good at getting us a table without any fuss. Once seated we were warmly greeted by waiter... our new friend for the night lol! He was not only extremely well spoken in English but also very patient taking his time explaining each and every dish multiple times even though there was a line out the door. We started with awesomeCocktails c'mon who can pass up a poached pear in maple syrup yummines! We then went on to the marrow with beluga caviar and fresh bread , and foie gras pasta almost like a ravioli.... IT WAS PURE ART! Then onto the main course which was out of this world ! Cassoulet was made to perfection! I must say if one watches Anthony Bourdain you will knowwhat I mean when I say we had a Bourdain moment of meat sweats shots more meat sweat more shots followed by beer and dessert but most of all awesome service from the wait staff who drank with us and laughed to no end.  Well worth it!"

All I can say is Wow! Salt cod fritters were wonderfully crispy outside and tender inside, the sea urchin special was simply devine. We also had two other appetizer specials and shared the duck in a can and a bottle of wine. If you aren't looking for a romantic night, sit at the bar to watch the kitchen work it's magic. The kitchen staff are cool as a cucumber and the wait staff is extremely accomodating and quick to offer suggestions. Make a trip to the bathroom to see constant cooking video steam on the flat panel...yeah, I said the bathroom. At first it was odd, but then it was genuinely entertaining. Overall the food quality was outstanding, they used lots of seasonal ingredients in the specials, and combinations were creative and presented beautifully."

Absolutely get the fois gras poutine, but be sure to have your cardiologist on speed dial first. Try the blue cheese/apple/endive or the beet/goat cheese salad - ithey are delicious, and will make you feel slightly less guilty about everything else you've ordered.

The place is packed and there's no way you'd get seated without one. This was definitely one of the most memorable meals of our recent trip to Montreal. Even though we couldnt try everything on the menu, it was nice to see the dishes our neighboring tables ordered. My husband and I ordered:- Pate de campagne: great to start off the meal. Fresh, definitely sparked my appetite for more.- Duck in a can: So yummy!!!! Everyone says it's worth getting- and IT IS! Just get it. It's not like anything you'll get anywhere else. Super juicy and the meat just falls off the bone. And oh yea, there's a big chunk of foie gras in there too. Weird to think something cooked in a tin can could be so special, but it is.- PDC Melting Pot: Very tasty and fun to get a sample of different meats, including blood sausage. We also loved the relaxed atmosphere- no need to dress up because it's not one of those foofy stuck-up places. The store front is completely open, so it's almost like eating outdoors if you're seated by the front. The space is pretty tight- we kept joking that being skinny must be a requirement to be a waiter there. Service is kind of slow. We were there for over 2 hours, but we didn't mind because we were there to relax and enjoy our dinner. No one rushed us out the door despite it being so crowded. Our main waiter was really nice and friendly, however the people bringing our food to the table weren't the best. We found a hair in our pate and asked for a new one, and judging by the reaction, you'd think WE did something wrong! No apology- he just took it away and brought us a new one. Not a big deal, but you'd think for the amount you're spending, a little customer service would be nice when we find hair in our food. Overall, a great experience and definitely worth a trip to. Keep in mind they are closed Sundays and Mondays when making your reservations....so plan around it! It's worth it."

So, if you are planing on finishing a whole plate, do write off the night! The wait staff is very professional and friendly. Call and reserve in advance.

/user_details?userid=X1Ae2W56S264mMeeEFIeFw,Rob G.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Here is the tale. My wife and I were visiting Montreal for an extended weekend and popped in to Au pied de cochon in hopes that they'd be able to take us in for dinner. In spite of not having a reservation (which I recommend you get) they had a table for us. Blammo! Positive point number one: No reservation but got a table during the dinner rush.The food was phenom.  We just decided to try appetizers, and were happy with that. The tomato tartlet is a winner.  The cochonnailles platter was a great choice too, although there was one meat (maybe bison) that nearly made my wife puke.  We also ordered the poutine.  It was good, but had a good laugh when they brought it out and I realized that it was a 14lb plate of fries, cheese and gravy. I've tried poutine in the U.S. but got a schoolin' about what real poutine is.  Very tasty, and if you've never tried it, I suggest giving it a shot.The tables are close together, so be prepared to rub elbows with your neighbors.  If you're not shy and don't mind projecting your conversation to the other patrons, you'll fit right in.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Our waitress was on the spot with refills.  We did notice at the end of the meal that it took a long time to get our bill, but not sure if that was our fault for not signaling that we were finished. No big deal, we weren't in a hurry.Overall, it was very good and I had a great time.  I'd give it five stars if we'd not had to wait 20 minutes for our bill after we finished, and if some of the items on the platter weren't a little suspicious, but overall this is a great stop if you're in the mood for a nice meal with friends."

ExcellentAppearance--from the street it's in between a few other restaurants and no sign so nicely camouflaged unless you know the address.  Inside, some seating in front then narrow row of seating opposite a long bar, comfy, homely, friendly vibe.  Mix of all types of clientele. Smells great inside.  Service--excellent.  We had several different staff swarm us throughout the meal. The main front of house gent (not sure if he is Maitre-D, owner, sommelier) but basically a jack-of-all trades as he was taking orders, explaining the menu, we let him choose our wine and he did a great job on that.  There are other staff food running, clearing, etc.   Very efficient.  We were seated across from the big brick oven and there was a gent slicing fresh hot bread and he kept turning around and giving us more, it was soooo good. Food--As everyone describes, very rich and filling.  My wife and I have not have much experience with Fois Gras so you have to take our food portion with that understanding as I've read many where people went crazy.  So for us, our favorite course was actually our first, it was a pear and seared Fois Gras appetizer with a maple type glaze, perfectly caramelized.  It was ridiculously good, almost like a dessert it was so good.  I think that was part of our flaw as we ordered mussels to go with that and I don't think the combo of the two suited well together (which was our mistake).  The mussels arrived quickly after the pear dish and I think our sweet tooth from that first dish made the seafood of the second not as complimentary as maybe if we ordered it alone or had it at a different point in the meal.  My wife and I split the Duck in a Can entrée, and true to reviews, it really does come out in a can, that they open tableside and pour over a pureed cauliflower mixture.  The duck breast I thought was excellent, medium rare it appeared.  My wife struggled with this as she is not a huge duck fan (lack of really eating it vs a like/dislike).  Overall we thought that dish was good but actually liked the first course the best.  Soooooo glad we did not order a 2nd entrée because we were too stuffed to even have dessert.   One cute thing that we didn't understand is that near the beginning is when they give you the free bread/butter, they put this tiny dish that has what looks like two white tablets in it.   I had no clue what they were, finally a guy came by and poured hot water over them and they unfolded into this cute warm cloths to wipe your hands with.   Just a nice touch that was unexpected.  On my next trip back to Montreal, I'd like to try some of the other dishes like the pork chop, the melting pot, etc."
/user_details?userid=qYPxyG-5MNgeEgwvrwT-KQ,Susie A.,"Tustin, CA",5 star rating,I can truly say that the roasted squash (mini pumpkin) stuffed with frois gras and mushroom sauce/gravy was out of this world. One of the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. It was seasonal so not part of the regular menu and I regret not taking a picture of it.  The server mentioned that the chef came up with the idea couple of days ago since they freshly harvest squashes from their farm.  It was a big serving for an appetizer. We also had pork chops and the duck.  Phenomenal!!  If anything I would pass on the dessert next time. Order the chocolate molten cake and it was ok.  We were so stuffed at that point so wasn't that enjoyable.
/user_details?userid=x1DO3SBrCO_R-SVDZ3r5RQ,Chris L.,"Holmdel, NJ",3 star rating,"With all the hype  around this restaurant it was inevitable to find some shortcomings but all in all it was a wonderful experience. The first one was the hostess. She was so frazzled with the tempo of the busy restaurant that she repeatedly snapped at waiting patrons and me as well.  While standing in line we remarked to each other that the restaurant should hire someone to help her. Or just find someone more equipped with handling the stress of working in a restaurant.  It's a bad thing to have her be the gatekeeper of the restaurant. Very bad impressions from the start.  Once we were seated though the experienced wait staff quickly made me forget about the overwhelmed anxiety stricken hostess. Being a party of two I was unable to order what I really wanted in  the pigs head and pied de cochon.  They are humongous showstoppers that made my jaw drop when passing my table.  I had to settle for the tartare temake, foie gras poutine, sturgeon quenelle, foie gras nigiri, and eel special.  I ordered the eel special cause upon entering the restaurant there are huge fish tanks filled with live eels waiting to be devoured.  This was the only mistake I made for this dish was horrible.  The eel was dressed with a weird pesto that gave the fresh eel an unappetizing fishiness that made me gag. On another note the sturgeon quenelle was mind blowing with its soft mousseline texture and rich lardon cream sauce with a hint of maple sweetness to cut the richness. This was by far the best dish of the night.  The foie gras poutine was good but I was surprised that I liked the cheese curds more than the actual foie gras in the dish. The fg nigiri was a pleasant surprise with its huge quantity and exquisite flavor from the maple soy sauce and peanut sauce flavoring.  The only downside was that there was quite evident blood vein that ran the length of the fg piece that had me flavvergasted. How in the he'll are you a temple of foie gras and you don't remove the vein even upon seeing it in plain sight. As a chef this was a travesty for such a foie gras centered establishment. All in all this was a good meal but I would only be back with a large group so I can watch their faces as the pig head and pied de cochon were dropped at the table."

H.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",5 star rating,"I went here twice, and both times had an excellent dining experience!The last visit was during Thanksgiving holidays, and we had 10:30 pm reservation. It is a bit late for dinner, but this was the only available time. We arrived 15 minutes earlier, for we knew how busy this place is. Despite being early, we still had to wait for extra 30 minutes, and finally got our table at about 10:45 pm. Now, at any other place I would be upset about the delay, but this one is an exception. The place is bustling, and we were fortunate to get a reservation just couple days in advance. Plus, I can imagine how hard it is for the lone hostess to mange this huge and unabated crowd.Once we got a table, the service was prompt yet not annoying (unlike many places in Boston, for example, where you might feel pressured to ask for the check and leave in the end of the meal). The food was absolutely delicious, with generous portions. I had Happy Pork Chop, and my wife ordered a duck dish (don't quite remember the name, but not Duck in a Can). Both dishes were perfectly executed. Since portions are large, and quite heavy in terms of fat and caloric content, we ordered light desert - Poached Pear, which comes with wonderful vanilla ice-cream. Additionally, the restaurant now has its own beer - Pied de Cochon, a light brew that goes well with large amounts of fat pork and duck meat. Another important aspect is the price - dinner for two with tips will cost you less than $150, which I consider to be an excellent price given the quality of food. In summary, excellent restaurant with casual, laid-back atmosphere that allows you to enjoy delicious food without breaking the bank."

The Look and The Feel Don't expect a quiet, subdued fine-dining experience. The ambiance is lively and jovial, especially on Saturday nights. Even though this restaurant is surprisingly small, it maintains its appeal by providing customers a warm cozy feel. The decor is mostly wooden with touches of an old cellar charm with wine bottles and recipe books lined up. On warm nights, like many restaurants in Montreal, the glass front door is stays open allowing customers a completely unobstructed view of the charming Avenue Deluth Est. The Menu The menu filled is filled with duck, pork, fois gras, duck, pork, and more fois gras :) But don't let the omnipresence of meat fool you. Yes, it is a carnivorous dream to be dining here, but they also offer a great selection of fresh Nova Scotia seafood. For those customers who are on a diet or complain of food being too rich tasting---stop reading now..... Our OrderApp: Foie Gras Cromesquis---It comes in two small balls filled with Bordeaux wine and fois gras, slightly fried and made to perfection. You just pop them in your mouth and they melt away leaving your tongue dancing for more. App: Duck carppacio--who knew raw duck with some spices and chives would taste so delicious.  This dish is served with a raw egg yolk which adds a creamy richness flavors. The french bread went perfect with this.App: Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad- I told you this place is not just for carnivores. The salad was crisp, fresh, and truly memorable. Main: We ordered the signature dish--Pig's feet--and the lobster. Both were cooked to perfection and simply delicious.  I personally recommend the lobster  not the signature dish and I'll tell you why later. The lobster was succulent and cooked to perfection. I loved the fact that there was huge pieces of lobster, no shells all meat!  The pork was simply good, nothing to write home about. From start to finish, my husband and I felt guilty eating food that was so tasty. The ServiceService was friendly. The greeter was super friendly. Our waiter, on the other hand,  was mediocre. He explained to us that he used to be a master chef and seemed a little bitter to be a waiter, but overall he tried his best to be pleasant and he did a descent job at following up with us for drinks and to check on how the meal was going. Lost a PointSo here's where Au Pied de Couchon loses points for me....The waiter recommended numerous dishes but did not mention the signature dish, so we asked if the signature dish is popular. He said yes, oh yes, it's popular. What he failed to mention to us is that the signature dish is big enough to feed at least four people. We were really disappointed that this ex-master chef/server did not mention the size of the dish. I wish he would have said something along the lines of ""Yes, this is our signature dish and it is very famous, but it's not very popular due to its size. There are other dishes on the menu I'm sure you would enjoy such as...."" I also wished that he mentioned that the flavours are not really unique. Although the meat was tender, to me it was just a great roasted diner, no unusual flavors or presentation. It was literally a log of meat on a bed of mash potatoes with gravy--Overall ExperienceOverall we were happy with the food and dining experience. The location was great. The ambiance was cozy. The food was unique and uniquely prepared. The service was pretty good. Overall, we had a great adventure indulging in French cuisine."

I knew this place would be a challenge for me since i don't really eat strange animal parts etc. Hmm... let's go with the French Onion soup then, since it's my all time favourite soup on the planet. The waiter assured us that everything on the menu was available. But when i got up from the table, and he came to take our order they said no French Onion soup today. Hmm... the bf did his best to order for me since i wasn't there. Steak & frites it is. Sounds good. We also wanted to get the Oreilles de Crisse, but they didn't have that either. Bummer.The waiter took forever to bring our wine, we had to remind him a couple times. When we got the wine it was deeelish! YAY! That made me feel better. I also substituted the frites for mashed potatoes, which i had heard were to die for. When my meal came the steak was very pink. Ya, i know i know... that's the way you are ""supposed"" to eat a steak. But I like mine a little more brown and a little less dripping with pink ooze. When i asked to get it done a little more they refused, saying the chef won't cook it any more because it ruins the taste. Hmm, i can try to understand that i guess. But really, I'M the one eating it! So, no, i didn't find it delicious. I only ate around the outside. Meh. The potatoes were really good though.  For dessert we ordered Pouding Chômeur. It was okay, but i was glad we shared it between the 4 of us. It was really sweet.

Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"A gander at the distribution of rave reviews on Yelp and a peek at the Anthony Bourdain video of this place convinced me that Au Pied de Cochon would be a memorable experience.And oh, was it memorable.Service was slow and perhaps more insultingly, indifferent; we continually had to flag different waitstaff down to get, variously, bread, drink, etc because our waitress was busy walking past us to get between her other tables and treated us as if we didn't exist. At the end of the meal, we successfully accosted her to ask for the check, and she promptly disappeared again for 30 minutes before we complained to someone who was equally indifferent to our plight but at least gave us the bill so that we could leave.What was the true let-down, however, was the food. Knowing this place had a menu built on very fatty and rich foods, I thought I was prepared. I ordered the pied de cochon because, well, the place is called the pied de cochon. What arrived must have been a pied + an entire flank + slabs of duck liver + several onions drenched in sticks of butter de cochon, dumped unceremoniously in a giant deep dish. I entered into a very meta space in which I started wondering whether the volume of the food, if stuffed into a plastic bag, would exceed the volume of my head, and what the percentage weight of my own pied was to the weight of this pied. Concluding that I would surely win a Darwin award for dying from complications of gastric bypass surgery if I tried to down this dish (because this pied sure as hell was not going to bypass by itself), I took 4 bites and called it a -very disappointing- night.And then the dilemma of what to do with the remains, which constituted a largely untouched dish. I considered dragging them home with me to make 10 gallons of stock, but since home is a 12 hour Amtrak ride away and my freezer really doesn't have that kind of spare capacity, I took a moment to apologize to the pig for a waste of a life, and said adios.It is actually beyond my comprehension how one person could eat this dish. The sheer amount of food and fat transcends mere excess and enters into the realm of the grotesque.

We ventured to Montreal at the end of November, ready to brave the cold because we knew this type of food would be best in cold weather. We made reservations for Thursday (American Thanksgiving) and we were super excited to finally experience a meal here. We arrived a little early, but they seated us right away. Then they brought us the delicious warm bread and butter. I was already happy, but my husband reminded me not to gorge myself until our food arrived.We decided to order the fried goie gras appetizer. We also had to order the foie gras poutine. Then we had the melting pot (pork belly and sausages), as well as the stuffed pig foot with foie gras. Everything was AMAZING so delicious. That gravy on the poutine was a revelation and then with those generous hunks of foie gras. Amazing. I though the melting pot was big but then the stuffed pig foot came out in a huge casserole dish (like the type of dish that would feed a family of 6). So much food. Our waiter kind of warned us it would be a lot of food but we were shocked by how much food it was. Everything was delicious. We also ordered a bottle of wine to wash it all down. I was pretty full after the poutine and only had a few bites of the pig food as well as some of the sausage. My husband rallied and kept eating. Then when our waiter asked if we'd like dessert, we both felt pretty full but when we saw the ""sugar pie for 2"" we figured that we'd come all this way, we better do it up right. That sugar pie was heavenly. It also came with some of the most delicious ice cream. I wish I had some of that pie right now. I think we were clearly stuffed and about to pass out from being so full, so our waiter brought over a bottle of calvados and made us do a shot with him so we wouldn't pass out. It was a very kind gesture and we appreciated it. Anyways, we had an amazing time and it was worth it. We felt too sad to leave our leftovers there, so we carried them all the way back to our hotel even though we didn't have a chance to eat them..."

We ordered a starter, an appetizer and an entree. For some inexplicable reason, the entree arrived first, the appetizer second and the starter last. Not to mention that we watched someone's elbow go into the appetizer prior to it being brought to us.Oh. And the bathroom. Someone had an accident all over the floor in the bathroom."

/user_details?userid=Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ,Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j'adore la cuisine Québécoise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It's pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it's not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go ""whaa...?"", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed pâté and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.P.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: ""No animal is safe from his kitchen"""
/user_details?userid=rY2PFyPybSUATBsOEihAsg,Sandra K.,"North York, Canada",2 star rating,"This place totally makes me think of the Black Hoof in Toronto, following the trend of in your face meat eating, where patrons eagerly munch on bone marrow as appetizers before settling on pig's head (yes literally pigs head) for the main course.You have to be really hungry to eat here, and on a low fat diet to prepare yourself for the cholesterol shock that is about to hit your digestive system.I wanted to try something light, which is probably why the night didn't fare so well.  I followed ht the waiter's recommendation for an original ""salad"": pan seared veal over potatoes and watercress.  The dish was immersed in olive oil to the point of being soupy, and topped with an egg.  There was very little in the way of greens, so I don't know how this was categorized as a salad.  Unsurprisingly, this was very, very heavy.   I give full points for creativity, since I've never quite had anything like it before, but can't say I enjoyed it and could only eat half before I felt overwhelmed by the grease. The creme brulee and molten lava cakes were fine as desserts--but they are always a safe bet. If you're looking for a meaty place, this is for you.  If you were hoping for a light meal go somewhere else."
/user_details?userid=bgVxJI9Jgr7p7bKIVLkUoA,Roberto B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"If ""Au Pied de Cochon"" were a rock band, it would be Queen circa 1979. And if Chef Marc Picard were a rockstar, he would be a latex-clad, cocaine-snorting, sex-crazed Freddie Mercury. This restaurant is pure rock 'n roll on a plate. Uncompromising, unhealthy, and unlike anything you've ever tasted.I had heard about it from my friend in Montreal, and like many others, had drooled in delight at the Bourdain ""No Reservations"" segment filmed at the restaurant. For a serious gourmand, foie gras is up there with caviar, truffles and oysters in the ""leave your pre-conceptions behind"" department. It is also one of the most delectable things on the planet, and Monsieur Picard simply knows how to do it. Right. There is simply no point in coming to this restaurant if you are not willing to put yourself, and your health, at risk. In all honesty, I would recommend three things:1) A group of friends who love food, and by love I mean ADORE it. They must also love foie gras, specifically.2) A full de-tox the day prior, with perhaps a few pieces of celery to keep the body going. But for God's sake, do not eat a regular meal within the 24 hour window period preceding the pig-out. This is a religious experience, and as such it must be treated with reverence, discipline, and a little fear.3) Start smoking and/or go to the gym on a regular basis, because the only thing that can tame the foie gras coma you will be in is half-a-pack of smokes, or a swift 15-minute walk around the block right before dessert.With that in mind, we arrived prepared and loaded with cash. The place is expensive, but I am not even going to get into a financial dissection. How much would you pay to see Freddie Mercury live? Exactly. Some things exist beyond crumpled pieces of cash, or faded plastic credit cards. Some things are immortal- like Freddie, or foie gras. The clientele is generally quite youthful- between 25-40. Nobody in their right mind would eat here past 40 without a cardiologist by their side. It's a good space, not huge, with so-so acoustics. Realistically though, you won't have time to talk much since your mouths will be occupied 80-85% of the time. Think of it as a foie gras bordello, with you as the old hooker.So we began. We ordered a Foie Gras burger; pan-seared Foie Gras; the infamous Duck-in-a-can; the pig's foot; an assortment of vegetables; and an absolutely out-of-this-world bottle of Cotes de Provence. So good, in fact, that we went for the same bottle twice. Of course, we shared everything.The burger was ""monstrous"". The waiter had warned me, but I was on a suicidal mission and decided to order it as my appetizer. It's basically a lean beef burger doused in a balsamic reduction, with a slab of foie gras on top. The burger buns were crunchy and firm (presumably to hold the whole structure together), and though it needed some serious scaffolding work half-way through, it held together nicely. The whole thing was a knock-out punch to the senses. Strong, aromatic, but surprisingly well thought-out, with the foie gras giving a creamy after taste to each beefy bite. It is often the simplest dishes that reveal the true artistry in the kitchen, and the quality of ingredients. Please welcome dish numero deux, the pan-seared foie gras- possibly the simplest dish on the menu. Served with garlic crostini and a mild balsamic reduction (notice the trend), the foie gras was crispy on the outside but revealed a molten, sweet center. This is not the kind of foie gras we are often accustomed to- the mousse-like paste to be spread onto bread or toast. This is the liver itself, unprocessed and untainted. Beautiful. By this point we were starting to feel the calorific after-burn, but the best was yet to come. The duck-in-a-can is a mechanical marvel. A waiter comes over with a tin can labelled ""canard en conserve"". A deep plate is placed in front of you, and in it is a bed of pillowy mashed potatoes. The waiter then cracks the can open, and pours its content over the mashed potatoes. Magically, the mashed potatoes are joined by half a mallard duck, jus, foie gras, garlic, balsamic demi-glaze and other heavenly ingredients. There are literally are no words to describe the richness and exquisite taste. Comparing it to anything I'd previously eaten would border on criminal.Similarly, the pied de cochon  is a delicate oven-roasted miracle stuffed with foie gras. It was at this point that my friend and I looked at each other and realized that we were born in the wrong century. In our food-fuelled daze, we saw each other as feudal lords, or kings, feasting on pig, engorged liver and wine, loving every second of it. The restaurant is essentially a time-warp to the land of gluttony. If Henry VIII were alive, he would have a permanent reservation in the back. Life is short, cholesterol is over-rated, and ducks are generally unimpressive creatures with little-to-no personality. Raise your glass to Monsieur Picard, and rock 'n roll."

Not for the faint of stomach (think duck fat and pork), faint of heart (think duck fat, pork and your arteries) nor the faint of wallet (think duck fat, pork and a  reputable name that costs money to even utter).Call in your reservation weeks, even a month or so in advance. This is no walk-in spot. Please do not bring your squeamish friends here as they will not enjoy the experience, and you may not either. Also, do eat lightly the day of because this meal will consume and overtake your body, and also that part of your brain that controls  food comas. Our reservation was called in a couple of weeks in advance, and we got an 11pm block on a friday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself isn't cabaret. No flashing lights or people in pig costumes. It blends with the surrounding establishments on its block, ninja-like if you aren't keeping a good look out. The ambiance is actually very casual, and upbeat. Oh and their piggy icon is very symbolic of this spot, a little bit comical, a lot fatty.We wanted to sample a lot of different things: two orders of the foie gras poutine, the infamous duck in a can, pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras, boudin maison, and côte de cochon heureux.The foie gras poutine was heaven on a plate. With every bite, I could hear angels trumpeting behind me. I scooped up the last bit of it with our complimentary bread. Never knew I could fall in love with something so alien to me. Duck in a can! Literally. It's quite a sight and very photo/vid worthy to catch them serving this up to you. Taste-wise, the amount of duck fat in there would make a roll of papertowels run away, but it ridiculously succulent.Stuffed pied de cochon swims underneath a rich, glorious brown gravy, if you're lucky, you'll find some semi crispy skin under there. I know I did. Boudin maison was a delectable porky tenderness as well, probably the more conservative of the dishes. Wasn't a fan the last dish on our list because there was just way too much blood sausage, which I have never been a fan of. To cap this artery-clogging feast, and about 1:30 am,  we got brazilian coffee. Hot, creamy and liquor-y.Unforgettable experience best saved for the brave."
/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Being Québecois I always have a soft spot for Cuisine du Terroire and without a doubt, Le Pied de Cochon is its Mecca. Martin Picard, the owner and chef of PDC has a penchant for my number favorite food stuff of all time: Foie Gras. His menu is littered with Foie Gras. The menu has items and then with added Foie Gras just to make it even better. Just with that he would score points with me. I was simply unprepared for the ways he presents Foie Gras and it changed everything.You're probably saying ""Dave, you're going overboard here, Foie Gras is good but it's not life altering"" to which I answer ""Sit down, shut up and read on"" because you obviously haven't been to PDC and have experienced what I have experienced. I'm sure it's the kind f elevating sensation those religious people experience during conversion.It started with The Cube or as the menu calls it Foie Gras Cromesquis. When your plate is presented the waiter has to give you some instruction first. He explains that it's a Foie Gras Terrine breaded and then deep fried. The terrine is now liquefied so you must wait a minute or two for it cool down and when you do bite down on it, keep your mouth closed. I looked at him with incredulous eyes. I take hold of the breaded cube, put it on my tongue and closed my mouth as the waiters behind the bar looked on, I bit down on it and then... time... stopped... My eyes closed and I wanted to say something but the Cromesquis exploded into a liquid spray of flavor napalm. At that very moment I could have died and it would have ok. This was only the beginning.I then continued this blissful expedition to culinary perdition with an off-menu item that was offered to us. Fried-Head cheese on a Gribiche sauce. The Head-Cheese was breaded with a smear of goat cheese on top and the Gribiche was just so good that I cleaned out the plate. The head cheese was so far beyond what I expected. The meat tastes so much stronger and is more diverse in flavors. Unbelievable and the best head-cheese I've ever had in my life.Did you think we we're done with entrée? Oh HELLLLL NO. Picard mixes Quebec's masterpiece of fast-food with Foie-Gras and turns into an orgasmatron of taste and sensation. Poutine with Foie Gras. Just the idea was mind-boggling and the execution was akin to sex with a very willing firm horny barely legal co-ed. I've had a lot of Foie Gras before but this was simply the most textured, flavored and fragrant one I ever tasted. I just wanted to bash my head on the bar it was so good.I ordered the restaurant's namesake dish, The Pied de Cochon. Pied de Cochon translated means Pig's Foot. And that's what it was. A whole pig's foot and some of the leg too. It was MASSIVE. The meat is removed braised and then stuffed back in the breaded leg with the hooves. It's layed on a bed of mashed potatoes then covered with a medley of tasty and very aromatic veggies, some of which I failed to Identify. Oh and yeah with a cherry on the top, another artery clogging portion of Foie Gras. The plates was enough to feed a family of rufees for a week and it was impossible for me to finish it but trust me that no meat was left on the plate, just the hooves and some veggies. Pig's leg is easily the tastiest part but it's work to get at sadly and probably explains why my mother only made Pig Leg Stew once a year.I decided to attack the desert menu. I quickly spotted Pudding Chômeur (poor mans pudding) I had to try Picard's take on this cultural institution. I was not dispointed, it was dessert heaven - though my mom's Pouding chômeur was light years beyond his - and a brilliant close on the evening.The service was top notch friendly and unpretentious. If you've ever seen Picard's show, he looks like a lumberjack, he's not anything like a snotty pedantic chef, he's all about good food and he'll go and kill it himself to get it on the plate. So his staff is equally relaxed and approachable. I'm not big on chi-chi restaurant experience and this restaurant looks like a sugar shack and is very laid back while still having 2000$ wine bottles on its wine list. Fine Dinning without the dickishness.Le Pied de Cochon is by far the best restaurant, culinary, eating experience I've ever had and I can't even begin to explain why. All of the above are mere ramblings of a mad man drugged by an experience that will not soon be overcome. I seriously doubt I can find another food experience to top my carnivorous proclivities anytime soon. Best Foie Gras ever, awesome head cheese, sublime Poutine, insane Pig's Feet. It took me about 3 days to come down from the rush. There is a God and his name is Martin Picard."

He raved about the food so much that on his next trip, I joined him and we had reservations for our final night in town. Too eager to wait, we went twice on our trip. DAY 1:We had tarragon bison tongue, followed by their famous trotter, a deep fried pigs leg stuffed with veggies served on a bed of cheese infused mashed potatoes the consistency of cheese pizza, topped with foie gras. It was amazing!DAY 2:Hungry for more we went BACK to AuPied for dinner and had some more amazing food- the highlight being foie gras cromquisse (spelling) - which was a foie gras stuffed hush puppie/fritter that was deep fried. You had to eat it in one bite and all the liquified foie gras came squirting out. We followed that with their beet/goat cheese salad which could have been a dessert, and it was so rich and so gorgeously presented. (it had beautiful greens and even a little lavender flower bud and then drizzled along side was beet puree.) Obviously our entrees were just as good, he had the PDC meatloaf and I had the PDC Melting Pot a porktastic selection of different meats on top of a bowl of the famous mashed potatoes. We each had a glass of wine, then went ahead and ordered a $67 bottle of Cote du Rhone, our three apps, two entrees and dessert, the bill came out to about $160.

The restaurant is quite small, narrow and long, an open plan kitchen and wood fired oven line one of the walls. Due to the proximity of patrons, pots and pigs it can be pretty hot, but in a hearty open fire type of way, it is immediately endearing.During our first visit we had what was arguably the finest dish there, not pig or duck, but lamb confit. The shank had been braised slowly in goose fat, rosemary and thyme. It was served on a bed of light puy lentils, a touch of vinegar lifting them against the rich meat. The sauce, OMG, was a heavily reduced lamb juice and tomato concoction, the depth of flavour hard to articulate, I was blushing and I am not normally shy. I was so enamoured that I spent the next two days hunting down the cook book and one year later recreated the same dish for my mothers European birthday adventure, it didn't disappoint. During my second visit we had the duck in a can, canned duck breast, foie gras, root vegetables and once again another incredible sauce. It may be a little gimmicky, they open the can at your table and throw it on a plate, but if it is good enough for Mr Bourdain (I am secretly developing a weird man crush) it is good enough for me. We also had a foie gras tart, which was devine, the richness of the foie gras offset buy the tart apple. So I suppose it is unfortunate that my last memory there is my least favourite. After much deliberation we decided to opt for their speciality, the pigs foot stuffed with foie gras, this is not a decision to be taken lightly, literally. If like me you have ever stared eye to eye with a pigs foot then you will probably be a little terrified by the idea, hoofs are just plain scary, I would eat a hairy tattooed biker any day. The foot comes in a crumbed batter atop a bed of mash strewn with root vegetables, drowning in a rich sauce with a few pieces of foie gras on top. It is not pretty. I found the majority of it intimidating and rather gloopy, even my sisters frenchie BF lacked the means to tackle it properly. For the next few days the pig took residence in my body like some dark poltergeist, I had both sweats and nightmares. You are warned.To avoid finishing on such a dark pig demon note, if in the Monte, you must go there, just heed my advice."
/user_details?userid=tWQv-fwM8u6HIFDfX_g5Fg,Esther C.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing.  This was a recommendation by two friends as I headed into Montreal for weekend getaway. We didn't realize the reservations were a must but were very lucky that the hostess was able to seat us for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Total fluke. Great atmosphere and a gorgeous summer night in April. The resaurant's front was completely opened which allowed light breeze and created a lovely backdrop for dinner. It's a quality restaurant that could easily be pretentious but doesn't carry itself to be that way at all. As recommended by bloggers and yelp reviews, foie gras poutine and duck in a can were a must. Sometimes you wonder if it's hype or buzz  but truly this is so worth it. Foie gras poutine - thick cut fries, foie gras, cheese curds and gravy. Best poutine EVER! The flavour of each of these ingredients stands out on it's own but compliment each other well. I've been trying to go dairy free; it's moments like this where I realize how much I love cheese and where I kick myself for giving it up. It's an appetizer, so a smaller portion; great for sharing. Makes sense though given the generosity of the entree portions. My two girlfriends' ordered starter salads and were dismayed at how big they were.DUCK-IN-A-CAN gets a paragraph for itself. Duck is my favourite and cooking it in a can was the best thing that could have happened to it. Picture a generous portion of duck breast with its fatty skin in a can. It keeps all of its flavour and fatty juices contained, also soaking up the flavours from cabbage, foie gras, thyme and sauces. They bring it out and open the can at your table, pouring it over toasted bread and mashed potatoes. It sounds simple, but it's anything but. I don't even think I participated in conversation for about 10-15 minutes. My friends were talking to me and I was in hazy bliss.I cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal and how devasted I was when something so yummy had to end. As I stated that night, I could have gone for a second round of duck in a can.Next time I go to Montreal, I will be making a reservation immediately after I book my plane ticket."

It's a nice looking restaurant, with a very busy feel to it. Made dinner reservations 2 weeks in advance, just to be safe. For appetizers, started out with the Cromesquis de foie gras, pork rinds, and a bone marrow dish. The cromesquis were absolutely amazing, and a great way to start off the dinner. Small cubes of deep fried foie gras that just melts in your mouth, washing your mouth over with fatty deliciousness. The pork rinds were fried deliciously, but isn't hard to mess up pork rinds. The bone marrow dish was probably my favorite, as I am a big fan of bone marrow, and this dish was crafted perfectly. It wasn't overwhelmingly rich, but the perfect amount of flavor and sauce that I soaked up with some bread.The entrees were the PDC pork cut, and the namesake stuffed pied de cochon. The pied de cochon was quite a large dish, and I would recommend not ordering it for one (unless you plan on taking it home). The PDC cut of pork was the thickest cut of pork I've ever had, and it was cooked perfectly all the way through, which I thought was an amazing feat. In terms of how it looked, it was pretty much a large cut of pork surrounded by various vegetables and rich sauce. The stuffed pied de cochon was another matter, it looked almost menacing to eat. The foie gras on top, inviting you to try and even attempt conquering the meal. It was indeed a very very rich dish, with mashed potatoes on the bottom that felt like a meal on it's own. Unfortunately my companion and I were too stuffed to even attempt desserts, so I can't comment on that. All in all though, it was a very enjoyable meal and I will definitely return to try desserts. It's not a restaurant you eat at often, only once in awhile when you get that craving for some delicious foie gras."

That and the poutine with foie gras (as an appetizer) and the duck in a can, which really is a duck in a can, boiled for 27 minutes and then dumped onto your place. It also has foie gras. Foie gras is everywhere in Montreal! This is rich, heavy, French food with a Quebecois accent, will leave you feeling extremely full, practically to the point of hallucination, and will make you shit out the entire population of Canada in the morning. So don't order too much.Unmarked door. Double-check the address before heading out. Reservations essential."

The chef de cuisine looks about 20, speaks and works a million miles an hour...highly skilled...downing espresso shots with co-worker while describing what he wants us to try.  Buffalo tartar comes rough chopped, in a metal bowl  similar to the one I use to feed our German Shepard, carefully broken eggshell holding a yolk to mix in. The best I have eaten. Oxtail w/ Paparedelle, Blood Sausage Tart.

It was AMAZING as was the Poutine Foie Gras.  My friend got the shepherd's pie, it was really good. And the beef tartare was good, but overwhelming for one person.  As for the Melting Pot... just pass on this dish.  Overall it was a really good experience and not as expensive as others would have you believe. But to be fair, we could only get a reservation for 5 PM (opening), which I believe played in our favor with the service. And it took three days and three phone calls to get that reservation.

I almost did not get in this past weekend since my reservation was somehow lost despite a voicemail confirming it. Service did their best but was slow. PDC was out of two wines that were on the menu. I don't know if I just had bad luck with the two I wanted, but, I can only guess they were out of other bottles as well. They were also out of the foie gras dish I asked for. At the recommendation of the server I ordered the Plogue à Champlain. This dish has a lot of potential but was not executed correctly. The dish was seared foie gras on top of English style bacon, potatoes and a crepe with the entier dish soaked in maple syrup. One of the components was cold and the foie gras was charred on the outside and close to rare on the inside. The only good dish of the night was the Tomato Tartlet that had a very good pastry crust. The proteins in the PDC's Melting Pot were not seasoned at all. The mash was good and I had to use it to get any flavor on the proteins. The special rib eye steak, recommend by the server over Shepherd's Pie was decent but nothing I could not prepare at home with a quality product. The worst dish of the night was the special desert. The summer pudding consisted of a 'cooked' shortbread with 'fresh' summer beers. The shortbread was under temperature and the berries had to have come packaged in syrup. A side of fries that was ordered with everything else never came. The one star is on the food alone. Based on all the hype and reviews here I don't know what to make of my one experience here. Was it an off night? In any event my meal was simply not good."

(btw whats up with their large utensils).the duck carpaccio was absolutely amazing.  cheese, mushrooms, chives, raw egg, the works. i would love to have this daily. ugh!! angry it isn't this good in nyc!!!the foie gras poutin. why not combine two things that are delicious right? ABSOLUTELY!!! would recommend ordering duck fat fries to supplement the remaining gravy and curds after you attack this dish. not salty, but truly flavorful. loved it. this place is truly crushing it!the desserts in montreal are not my cup of tea (neither is the coffee). but we went deep and got the special sunday for two!! seems like it was made for 5 people though.... maple vanilla ice cream, carmel popcorn, maple breading, maple cotton candy, gold leaf dessert. the chocolate was unnecessary, but the carmel popcorn and maple breaded pieces were good. i probably had two bites. it was not good enough to want to encounter more than a couple bites.i will however be back for more carpaccio and different foie gras dishes on each subsequent visit. yum!!! definitely the best and not somewhere to pass up!!!"

This place is famous for the foie gras, but it's a deep menu with many excellent dishes if you care to explore.If you come here don't eat with your eyes, eat with your taste buds. the plating is very rustic, but the taste is always good. except a few times when the cook gets a little heavy handed with the salt."

(SO worth it, highly recommended! So much work goes into their raw seafood platters, it's not just raw oysters and clams. In addition, it came with escargot in a black bean sauce, conch, mussels with a nice tomato broth, fancy mini melon balls in the raw oysters, sea jelly?!? in some fancy oysters, calamari with delicious aoli, a skewer of lightly fried white fish, some truly amazing scallops.)-Lamb Shank (perfectly cooked, wanted more and more- huge portion!)-Foie gras tart with blood sausage (SO SO GOOD. light puff pastry topped with caramelized onions, creamy melt in your mouth foie gras, with bites of sausage. big enough to share for two!)The bill with beers ended up being way cheaper than I thought I was going to spend going in.  The portions were generous and the quality of the food was tremendous.  I encourage trying anything on the foie gras menu because you probably won't find better preparations then here.  No wonder this is one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite spots.

I loved the baked cheese, I mean soup. It really was tasty. My husband liked the scallop, but he didn't love it. He wasn't raving like he sometimes does. And I think he was wanting another scallop. One is tiny. I had the duck carpaccio and poutine for a main. The duck was fabulous!  The raw egg added an extra level of complexity and flavor. The poutine was good, not knock your socks off great. He had the duck in a can which was everything he thought it would be. He loved it. We considered dessert, but didn't do it. I kinda wanted the sugar pie, but they were out.

/user_details?userid=gMauTkyEsh6bZZlSOoHAWA,Carol C.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"Oh my God. This restaurant. I. I don't even know why I try to write about it because its my happy place and when I'm sad I want to be there, tasting perfection and floating on a big, soft, foie gras cloud of beauty and love. When I get upset and I'm close to a computer I go on their website and I cruise their menu, reliving my glory days and dreaming about more to come when I figure out when I can visit their Sugar Shack. ::sigh::I'll start at the beginning. Bear with me, this is indeed, one of the experiences of my life I will not forget and I won't skimp. We called ahead to try to make reservations, but it was early, the message in fast French, and ended without options and just a hang-up. We decided to show up at 5 and try our luck.We showed up too early and walked around the neighborhood. We observed small dive bars off the main boulevard, little parks and benches we smoked ""waiting"" cigarettes on. Bright painted houses and small plants on windowsills - It was your typical quaint Quebecois neighborhood. I loved it.We walked into the restaurant when it was time: The phone was ringing off the hook, we were the 3rd party there and one party, of course, has a small child who was letting the world know he was very, very unhappy. We got the furthest table from that family, the waitress somehow read our minds.I sat down and I was looking through the menu and I was so excited. Everything sounds so delicious. How could I choose? I started off with what was easy. I got the house beer, which was very very light, bright golden ale and went down like water. Things felt better after that.The bread was hearty, fresh, and very nutty -  a little bit of a sourdough thing going on and I liked it. Was not toasted, but the bread spoke for itself. So did the fresh butter in the tiny mason jar...oh homemade butter I love you so! We started with the marinated smoked sausages, with pork and foie gras. It was that salty, smoky, meaty, somehow lemony taste that makes you think of good pepperoni without that much heat or oil. It was good, and a good portion of it too. Next, was the foie gras cromesquis. The waiter had to stop me before I cut into, what looked like, a cubed, fried cheeseball. He said to just put it on my tongue, keep my mouth closed, and let the liquid inside fill your mouth (Hm, where have I heard these instructions before?? Sorry.)Like a wave of an ocean, the liquid foie gras burst so tiny yet HUGE into my mouth, that gritty cube gave way to a sea of flavors and warm pulsing. It seemed to fill all your senses, you can't hear you were concentrating on the warmth, and your nose smells the cheese it was wrapped in, and the herbs mixed into it, and you were trying to chew and you had the urge to open your mouth to let it all out, its warm and gooey...but its too good to let go. Your reflexes force you swallow you try to control it, the urge to control your gulps and try to savor the moment....and it was gone. I said, ""Wow.""This is what food IS. And I'm still only on appetizers.The boy got the ""duck in a can"" which just serving it to us is a time in itself. A huge can and ceremony of opening is takes to your table. The contents stack marvelously onto your plate in shape of the can, until you demolish it for that perfect bite of lettuce, and perfectly cooked duck. The duck is soft and marinated and cooked to dreamlike consistency. The lettuce is not mushy but not crunchy and the little bit of sweet accents the softness of the duck. Great portions and great flavor.I got my foie gras hamburger. Mine, this was meant for me. Balanced on a bed of greens and a sweet, thick balsamic vinaigrette was a portion of foie gras and not too much boursin cheese. It is rich but not so much that you get a headache, instead you get that perfect balance of pleasure without the sin of a hangover that is heavy, fatty food...I kid you not that the only place I would ever want to be was right there, at that first bite of magic. To accompany were fries fried in duck fat with truffle sea salt. They were slightly crispy, and delicious.Dessert tops it all off, and I ordered the chocolate molten cake. It was soft and thick liquid in the middle, a sauce I sucked off the back of my spoon. The perfect end to quite possibly the perfect meal. I was content, I was satisfied, I ordered another beer and felt like I needed to have a cigarette as I've just had one of the most pleasurable experiences of my life. The waitress, the entire time, was very attentive, polite, eager to answer our questions, and so gracious when we were leaving. She really helped make it an awesome experience. The prices were slightly high, but definitely not unreasonable for a nice restaurant ($100 or so for everything, not including tip). This is a place I need to go every time I go to Montreal, even just passing by for an evening. We sent our highest compliments to the chef!!"

We had seats at the bar which was perfect given a superb bartender / waiter and getting to see the hustle and bustle of a very involved staff. Our server was extremely helpful in recommending dishes and highly recommended the veal shank for two and the crab and cucumber salad. First - the salad was super fresh and the crab ultra tender and flavorful. The veal shank was gigantic. It came served on a huge platter with polenta, red wine Demi glaze sauce fois gras sauce and these awesome pin wheel vegetables. The shank was braised and fall of the bone tender and juicy. Amazing meat. We couldn't finish but were highly satisfied although my wife thought while perfectly prepared the meat was a little bland. The bread we got in the beginning of the meal was also great. Served hot it was crusty and soft with yeasty slightly salty goodness. For desert we had the pecan pie with vanilla ice cream which I looved. It was flaky and the pecans crisp and gooey at the same time and the ice cream proved the perfect compliment. It would have better if it was served warm but not a huge deal. We had wonderful glasses of red wine through he evening. I'd highly recommend PDC to anyone on a trip to Montreal."

Everything else was just felt like an exercise in excess.  We should have taken a hint from the table of four hulking men next to us who opted to share the stuffed pig's foot stuffed with foie.  But instead, the waiter shamelessly let both myself, and a dining companion half my size, order one each for ourselves.  The fattiness and crisp skin together delivered a marvelously succulent bite, but once I downed a second forkful, I could already feel my arteries start to wince in pain.The duck in a can was pleasantly tender and succulent, but with all the elements blended together in this way, it almost felt like the flavours were bordering on monochromatic (although ""fatty rich goodness"" is not necessarily a flavour I would frown upon).The confit of lamb shank, however, seemed to impress the most critical of my dining companions, who noted that the moistness was deftly preserved, and the confit embodied a full, intense flavour without being overly gamy.And the french onion soup?  Just check out Jon H.'s review.  I think he would live and breathe and bathe in this stuff if he could."

Friendly and attentive people who i think really care about the food they serve and they way the serve it - this is considering how demanding the French (canadiens) and constantly busy this place is. The food is summed up in one word ""excessive"". Heavy, strong flavours, generous portions - typifying French Canadian country cuisine. My fav picks: Bison Tartar Duck in a can Foie Gras on pancake/maple syrup - Poutine is too heavy you won't be able to eat anything else Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras Fries (in duck fat) It's not a five because of the cramped arrangement and never was able to fit desert in. I'd give you some comparisons with other restaurants as i usually do, but this place is unique.

Just thinking about this place makes me want to gag. We didn't eat most of the food but the restaurant had no problem charging us. I really don't understand why this place is so popular."

When I got there, the place was packed and the hostess told us that the entire night was booked and without reservations for that night and the next, it would be impossible to get a table. This was understandable since it was a very popular restaurant. However, what really bothered me t was the hostess's attitude. I then asked her if I can get the foie gras poutine to go. She almost rolled her eyes and stood there as if she couldn't believe that I didn't just give up and leave.  And as I was in the middle of ordering, she turned around without a word and left for 5 min. When she came back, I resumed my order. After my order, she immediately added that there will be no utensils with my order in a really snarky attitude. Wow, I am sorry to have inconvenienced you by ordering a 30 dollar dish to go and one for each person in a three people party without you even having to serve it. Guess you really don't appreciate business. Finally, as we were waiting outside, I decided to go in to let her know that we are waiting outside to the left of the entrance in case she can't find us. She immediately says, ""It's not ready yet!"" For a popular and upscale restaurant, having a hostess like that really gives it a bad reputation. When we finally sat down to eat our poutine, the hostess's attitude already took half the joy out of it. The poutine itself tasted like normal poutine you get in Montreal with chunks of foie gras mixed in. The portion of foie gras was generous however I don't think it was worth the 20+ dollars extra compared to a normal poutine. Especially when it seemed to be just added in without having a sear or anything. I feel that the dish can be improved tremendously if a nice sear was given to the outside of the foie gras to add a next contrast of textures. Overall, this restaurant is just okay. I would not go back for the food and the hostess's attitude was definitely a turn off."

Two words- foie gras!Our hotel made bar seat reservations for us. Many people would be annoyed by this, but for two very enthusiastic home cooks, these were the best seats in the house. We had so much fun watching the action in the open kitchen. They should charge extra for these seats!The meal- incredible! We started with the foie gras cromesquis which were so delicious and fun to eat. They just melted in your mouth. We also had a seared foie gras and some type of cheese dish with a mushroom and corn sauce. Hard to describe, but so good, layered, and rich.For entrees we had the duck in a can, which is a marvel and really delicious. I had the  veal with mushrooms and fava beans in a conaque sauce topped with foie gras. Amazing!For dessert we elected to share the lemon meringue pie which was good but certainly not the star of the show. Apparently that honor goes to the baked alaska, which we were just too full to tackle. Next time.The chef engaged us in conversation a couple of times to answer questions about the dishes. And, then finished the meal by doing Jager shots with us. Fantastic place. If you like foie gras or a real culinary adventure, this is the spot!"

/user_details?userid=egDymReIGgB2USiHWVSASw,Lee M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"It's a little difficult to be original when there are well over 100 prior reviews of the same restaurant, but I will say that this place is on my short list of favorite restaurants of all time.  My one gripe about this restaurant, which I will get off my chest is that they give you an end time with your reservation.  Although I didn't expect to go beyond my 2-hour block, I found it a little off-putting.As for the food.  My wife and I ordered three things.  The tomato tartlet,  ploque de Champlain, and duck in a can.  Although the tartlet was nicely crisp, with juicy tomatoes, it wasn't worth the space in my stomach compared to the other two dishes.The ploque de champlain was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   It was sorta like a breakfast food but to the most extreme.  It contained stack of a pancake, potatoes, bacon, seared foie gras, and overflowing with maple syrup.  Truly memorable.  While gimmicky, the duck in a can, which comes with like a half a duck, a huge lobe of foie gras and other assorted bits in a rich brown sauce, and poured tableside over celery root puree is phenomenal.  Perhaps it wasn't the smartest thing to order after the ploque de champlain because it was excessively rich.And to top it off, we ordered the pudding chomeur, which had a seared caramelized top with an inside was served so scorching hot, it burned the roof of my mouth.  Not surprisingly, it was very sweet and very rich.Next time I make my way back to Montreal, I want to go for some of the raw bar, which looked extremely fresh.This place caters to serious eaters that are open to trying new things.  I wouldn't recommend taking someone who has any food phobias.  I would also recommend eating something very light earlier in the day since your gall bladder will be working on overdrive after you've finished your meal.Overall, the meal cost roughly $60/person, which I thought was pretty reasonable considering the amazing food experience."

What did it make you feel?During my trip to WorldCon in Montreal, a group of ten of us made our way to Au Pied de Cochon. We were a group from around the world: the UK, Israel, Australia, Seattle, the Bay Area. It was an amazing group and it led to fantastic conversation. The place is much smaller than I expected, but it was rough, not at all polished. There were visible boxes of stuff all over the place. That's a nice touch. it makes it feel less refined, which makes the food even better. We had a huge selection of stuff. My extremely tall buddy Niall had the Bison Rib. it looked like it would tip over the Flintstone's car for sure. The Lovely & Talented Linda had the Hot Pot. It was amazing. We had Duck in a Can, Duck Carpaccio, the fried cubes of fois gras, amazing poutine and I had a Shepard's Pie. My first bite and I nearly cried. No, seriously, it was that good. I had to stop, set down my fork and let myself get centered. I couldn't show weakness in front of the Brits. They may just try and run us over again. I loved the potatoes, the light cheese, the meat. It was all so perfect together. I absolutely loved it all. I couldn't speed through it. I had to go slow, had to come around slowly, take every bite, let it roll around. It was fantastic. I kept saying ""this is the most amazing meal of my life"" and it wasThe only downside to this place is that it gets crowded and noisy. The night I was there we were joined by Connie Willis, George R. R. Martin, Gardner Dozois and the folks from Locus Magazine. It was loud enough that we had trouble hearing our own conversaations.

/user_details?userid=VHgH7_Ardr0WS-dJ9qAxqQ,Mark R.,"Whitehorse, Canada",2 star rating,"So, my impressions - with the rave reviews we made reservations as soon as our travel dates were confirmed - about 6 weeks in advance.  On arriving, the hostess told us there were no tables available but that she could seat us at the bar (there were at least 3 vacant tables in sight at the time).  After a bit of discussion, we got a table beside the serving station and it became pretty clear that as tourists, nobody gave a rats-ass about us.  The food, well, it was really heavy.  I get it, they like pigs and they're big on meat but seriously, toss a salad into the mix. Over-all, I really wouldn't bother with this place.  Over-hyped and pretty full of itself, Montreal has a lot of other options out of there.  Interestingly, when I mentioned PDC and Joe Beef to a business associate who lives in Montreal, she hadn't heard of either of them."

The place was absolutely packed, but we were seated on time, at a table with a good view of the kitchen. Let me say a word about the kitchen, because this one was fantastic. There were two sous chefs floating around, and a number of line cooks, and it was like watching a symphony. Everybody knew their jobs, there was little to no verbal communication, no wasted movements, no drama. It was a treat to watch real pros do their jobs. One of the sous chefs, Emily, especially  brought a real sense of joie de vivre to the kitchen.The service here was very professional. Attentive, helpful, not at all snobby or elitist, and also not  irritatingly fawning. The food was fantastic. I had the duck in a can, which was heavy but a very well done dish. My wife had their fish special, which was excellent.I waited a few weeks before writing this review, because we pretty much ate our way across New England and Montreal, and were eating well every night, and I wanted to wait before writing some of these reviews to gain some perspective. My wife and I discussed it over dinner last night -- for me this was the top meal of the trip, for her, second best after Street and Co in Portland, ME."

I made the reservation in advance but we were lost and could not find the restaurant. I kept calling the restaurant and let them know that we were late. When we finally got there, almost 1.5 hour later, the restaurant was packed and there was a long line waiting. To our surprise, they kept our table! We were seated right away and the waiter was very patient to explain the menu. We both ordered an appetizer and an entrée with a glass of wine. The food was incredibly good and the price was reasonable. It becomes a must-go every time we visit Montreal. Over the years, I have tried most of their foie gras dishes (except for the pork foot stuffed with foie gras, which is too large for one person and I don't have any one to share with), also the venison tartar; my husband has tried most their game dishes, and we have never been disappointed. My recommendations: 1) Make a reservation or get there early. 2) Avoid the special or be prepared for a sticker shock (my husband ordered their special once; the dish was good but it was much more expensive than the items on the menu.) 3) Check out their wine cellar-- they have a very impressive wine cellar in the back. If you like foie gras, wild game, or a nice bottle of wine to go with your meal, you can't go wrong with this place."
/user_details?userid=4Ov1rgOoXDwPSXpfMUFT9A,Ryan S.,"Addison, TX",2 star rating,"Based on all the good reviews, we had to try this place when visiting Montreal.  3 weeks out, the best time we could get was 10:30 pm on a Sunday.  We took and and planned our day around it.  We arrived 30 minutes early in hopes to get seated a bit early.  It took 5 minutes for the hostess to even show up.  She then said we'd have to wait until our reservation because they were so busy.  As 10:30 came closer, two parties just walked right up without a reservation and got seated immediately.  So I approached the hostess to ask what was up, and she had no idea who I was.  Conveniently, we were seated 2 minutes later.  She is terrible at her job.We got seated and had to wait quite awhile for our  order to be taken.  The waiter seemed put out for having to explain the menu.  After we ordered, he then told us the specials.We were brought bread but no silverware, plates or napkins until we asked for it.  Then our FG Poutine arrived.  It was good, but not great.  The fries were just average and didn't taste like they were fried in duck fat.  And we only got 3 small pieces of FG on the poutine.  Not worth the $22.Then our entrée came - the duck in a can.  The duck was good, but not great.  It was very sweet, and the FG looked like fat.  It was almost impossible to cut with the dull Target knives they gave us.  I can't believe this entrée was $44!!  It's not worth half of that.Our server only checked on us once.  The water boy did refill us frequently.  I am shocked that this place is so busy.  It is totally not worth it.  Spend your money elsewhere."

I like how people I communicate with on Yelp from NY and NJ go to the same places I go in other cities and countries.We had all Duck entrees and apps. It is very filling and very rich! Anthony Bourdain recommends it so I knew it had to be good. Anthony Bourdain gained my respect only after he went to Hawaii. It was only  then that  I knew he knew food. (the Hawaii show of Anthony Bourdain is on the Travel Channel right now.) Meats are roasted to the point of falling off the bone in the brick oven.  chef Martin Picard gets  creative with one menu item that is the most abundant menu item : foie gras. It comes in 10 combination's, including as a tart, with poutine, and in a quirky  creation called Duck in a Can which does come in a can  (see picture) , it comes to the table with a can opener.

/user_details?userid=7qzfClFiE3SchM3F3MwIpA,N P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"The craziest thing that comes to my mind is my peaceful digestion after such a heavy meal. Now let's talk. I see PDC as a highly focused and high-end meat experience with no equivalent. The meat choice is impressively diverse and the risks taken by the cuisine are commendable. Indeed, I found some interesting combinations of French, Spanish and Northern American influences in the dishes and preparations. Above all, PDC also stands on its own as it reveals how complex and subtle heavier meats can be in terms of tastes and preparation. It will take you more than a visit to get accustomed to the opulence of the menu. But so far and for two, I'd recommend:- the Accra de morue: those of you who are familiar with these will understand how perfect they are;- the Foie gras poutine (I actually came with this dish in mind as it sounds cleverly insolent ) as an appetizer;- the Potee du PDC with its selection of different meat laying in an authentic Aligot (Southwestern French specialty made of cheese and puree).Service is the main flaw I would highlight: the manager suffers from excessive pendanticivitis and the waiter have some surprising preconditions for Alzheimer's disease."

The pastry was crispy and buttery, the cheese was nicely broiled and tomato flavour really pops.  I had the duck magret with mushrooms.  The first bite was a burst of flavour. The broth/sauce was concentrated and rich. After a few bites though, it quickly became way too much fat and salt. I just couldn't eat any more (hence the three stars).

In fact this place might be the best restaurant I have ever been to. I heard a ton about this restaurant and decided to do some research and plan out my meal ahead of time. I highly recommend this strategy since the menu is overwhelming and you will most likely order way too much food. To start we (my boyfriend and I) ordered the Foie Gras Cromesquis. They were pretty good. The liquefied foie gras inside exploded in our mouths as promised. Next we ordered the Duck Carpaccio which came topped with oil, spices, and a raw egg yolk meant to be mixed in to create a homemade mayo. The duck was paper thin and  good. The next item blew us away. The Bison Tongue in Tarragon Cream Sauce. This item was simply divine. Flavorful, tender, creamy, a hint of spice. The textures and flavors that made up this dish were perfect. I could eat this every day. Luckily my boyfriend acquiesced when I suggested we split an entree. After three appetizers we were already feeling full. We ordered the PDC Melting Pot which I would completely recommend to anyone who wants to try a bunch of different things but don't know what to order. I also highly suggest splitting this meal. Again, we were amazed that food could be made to taste that good. There were 4 different kinds of meat (homemade blood sausage, pork belly, homemade pork sausage, and another cut of pork) all perched atop a bed of fluffy, creamy, cheesy mashed potatoes and caramelized onions with a yummy and light brown gravy drizzled all over the thing. These flavors and textures all together comprised the best thing I will ever put in my mouth. So meaty, so flavorful. The blood sausage was rich and delicious. The pork belly literally melted in your mouth. I thought my boyfriend was going to cry over how good it was. We ordered duck fat fries on the side but sadly hardly touched them. We washed everything down with beer and the best cider I've ever had. We thought our stomachs were at capacity so we ordered the check. After sitting for awhile and enjoying the company of our fellow restaurant goers (coincidentally the tables on either side of us were from NYC and we all struck up lively conversations about food) Martin Picard comes over to our table and asks us how everything was. I guess we were so inspired by his presence that we mustered up the courage to subject our stomachs to more food, sent our check back and ordered a Sugar Pie and coffee. Great decision. The Sugar Pie was sweet but not overly so. It was creamy, the tart crust was buttery and it was served with refreshing vanilla ice cream. One of the best desserts I have ever had. Overall, our experience at this restaurant was fantastic. The jovial atmosphere was fun and welcoming. The waiter was GREAT. Friendly and so funny and helpful. Everyone seemed to be having a fantastic time oohing and ahhing at the dishes being served at the next table over from them. At 11pm when we were walking out, the place was still packed. If you are in Montreal and love food go here. Just go here. The prices are right, the food is other wordly and you will have a ton of fun. I can't say enough about this special restaurant. I truly doubt any other restaurant I eat at will live up to Au Pied de Cochon."

Had to make reservations a couple months ahead of time but definitely worth it. And I recommend that you make reservations as soon as you figure out when you're going to Montreal. Our reservations were at 7:30 and I over heard the waitress tell some walk-ins that they MIGHT be able to get them in for 10pm...at the bar. Portions are enormous. My boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers: Crispy PDC salad and Piglet Roast, one entree: PDC melting pot - this had mashed potatoes, blood sausage, homemade pork sausage, and porkloin, and a dessert: Creme brulee, and we were stuffed til the next day. You definitely do not need to get your own dish. Plus, sharing is caring! As for the service; surprisingly super friendly and efficient especially for such a busy restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Quite unfortunate some people had a bad time here.

Both are excellent and it's unlikely you will taste anything like it again.The only thing I would like to add is that if you want to make it an interesting experience you may want to sit at the bar right in front of the kitchen. It is clearly much louder, but you are able to see how each dish is prepared.Reservations are a must, however, if you do forget to make reservations just go there as soon as they open at 5pm and ask if you can eat at the bar.

/user_details?userid=HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Martin Picard is one of my favourite Food Network chefs.  So of course I had to come to his prized gem.   I also came on Tony F.'s behalf.  So Tony, this one's for you!I had called and made a reservation the week prior, but upon arrival they seem to have lost my reservation.  Not a problem as they were able to accomodate us.  As part of some strange rebellion my stomach was having against food (e.g. I seemed to never feel hungry), I didn't gorge at APDC.  Of the lot, I tasted the foie gras cromesquis, the salade PDC as well as the duck in a can. Foie gras and duck have always been a favourite of mine and so naturally, this would be the meat I chose for my conquest.The bread at APDC has now taken over the title of best bread ever. The spot previously belonged to the Woodlot in Toronto.  Their bread was only slightly warmed, but was very crusty on the outside, yet very soft in the centre. The foie gras cromesquis came first.  They are two dice-sized cubes, which the waiter explains has to sit for about 2 minutes prior to indulging simply because they are very hot.  Words really cannot describe the sensation I experienced as I bit into the fried exterior...I think the moment I bit into it, I must've blacked out from the intense flavour that was bursting on my tongue.  The only way I could describe the flavour is an intense, savoury, mouth-watering, French-onion-soup-like concoction with the buttery goodness of foie gras.  Don't be fooled by its petiteness. Its kind of like how everyone expects the short guy to suck at basketball because of his runt height, and then he ends up being the next Michael Jordan.  The only thing I would've changed about it is that I probably would've preferred a thinner battered exterior- though I'm sure the reason why it is such a thick batter is so that it doesn't melt the contents inside.  After having pondered further, we decided to add an order of the much-talked about foie gras poutine to our order (although we were iffy as to whether or not we'd be able to devour all this food!)My original intent of ordering a salad was to counterbalance the otherwise rich food that would follow suit throughout the evening... however, as I soon found out - there is NOTHING light about the fare that is served a la Martin Picard.  The salad was made from pig knuckle, bacon bits, sundried tomato, greens, and a very twangy and tart vinaigrette.  I found the salad to be a little too oily for my liking, and the tartness of the vinaigrette was so overpowering that even the heavy-weight contender (otherwise known as bacon) lost its dominant flavour.  All I could taste was sour twang.  The deep-fried pig knuckle was nicely done - hats off for the spicy mustard that topped it.  It was an amazing mélange.  Next came the duck in a can... Maybe I had sky-high expectations from all the hype and talk about it on Yelp, but I was not that impressed.  The duck breast was hard to cut into, even with our Atila-the-Hun-sized knives.  The layer of skin made me want to run and hide because it was so thick!  I have had roast duck at a Chinese restaurant before, and the skin is not usually that thick?  It was like a slab of fat and I just didn't care for the texture.  The foie gras that was in it was very nicely done, although not seared, still had a very nice flavour to it.  It was served with a turnip purée that had accents of bitterness to it.  The base of the dish was made with some sort of crostini and topped with a sauerkraut-like vegetable mixture that had a hint of tartness to it.  I think I was actually the most disappointed with this dish.Finally, came the foie gras poutine.  I am SOOOOOOO glad we collectively decided to order this dish because it made the experience.  I've had a foie gras poutine at Trevor Kitchen & Bar in Toronto, and it was swimming in oil... However, when the APDC version came out, I took a sigh of relief to find that it was not the least bit oily.  Bravo!  The gravy was the most amazing gravy I have ever tasted.  It is made with foie gras, a secret powder, and egg yolk.  The cheese curds were not salty, as the usual (which allowed the flavour of the gravy to really stand out).  The gravy was so good that I took the remaining slices of bread and soaked it all up!  It was just too good to waste.APDC was definitely an adventure, though it fell short of my expectation."

A raucous, friendly bar provides direct viewing access to the chefs in the kitchen, working their pork into mouth treasure.

/user_details?userid=Y_CW45WfOUtqwzN6HtuXRA,Amy Z.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Before dinner at PDC, I did not believe the term "" too much foie gras"" Our 1st dish was Foie Gras with bacon and fig (a special that night which I thought was only a small appetizer, but it was actually an entry size dish). The foie gras were perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth, but the fig was a little too strong and made the entire dish a bit too sweet.  By the end of the 1st dish, I was already pretty satisfied. And then our main course came:Mine was Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart (how big can a tart be? right? wrong!! this is not your regular tart,  it is meant to be shared by 4 very hungry people!!).  This dish was probably, by far,  the richest food I have ever had in my entire life!! With tons of Foie Gras AND blood sausages on a huge tart.  Although the dish tasted really great, I could only finish 1/6 of the ""pie"" and I felt... defeated.. by FOIE GRAS?! My husband ordered duck in the can which comes in a regular can, but I was surprised how much duck and foie gras were packed in that can.  Unfortunately, he was defeated too, left half of the foie gras and duck untouched. The duck, in my opinion, was bland. I did not try his foie gras though (obviously)...We also ordered the duck fat fries, they tasted just like the regular fries. For dessert, we ordered the Lemon Meringue Pie and Panna Cotta, the panna cotta was outstanding, pie was just all right. We will definitely return, and next time PDC, we  - will- be - prepared!"

Its a very small, cramped restaurant, with not so friendly waiters. Don't even get me started on the Chef. Had 3 other people with me and one who had special dietary requests for extreme health reasons, and I of course still ""pescatarian."" And yes, I knew this was the place for a carnivore, I read the Au Pied De Cochon Recipe book & did my research before hand, so I wasn't in shock or being difficult. My guests ordered:Foie Gras Hamburger Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie GrasFries (in duck fat)and I ordered the Salmon Pie (something like that, seasonal)If you're wondering what the other person's order was, it was nothing, because of his special dietary requirements. The Chef was SOOOOOO NOT willing to make him anything plain without sauce. So he sat there, and stared, not a bite to eat, which ended up being better.Yeah, I get it, its the Chef's kitchen, and menu, but still, really!??! Anyway.The food we did order came and stayed. None of us were pleased, everything was in Duck Fat, so everything was SOOOOOO salty and drenched in sauce. We had such high hopes, and were saddened by the lack of deliciousness. No one did any damage to their meals, and we all left hungry.They didn't even do their burger right, according to the person who ordered it. My Salmon Pie was worse than a microwaveable, boxed Banquet pie. This place encouraged me to learn how to make my own Salmon Pot Pie and non cooked in Duck Fat French Fries."

/user_details?userid=avxD6r3_MquP6xBbiaUHNw,Karin V.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I was intrigued when I heard that Au Pied de Cochon was one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite restaurants. Given that the restaurant's name means ""At the Pig's Foot"", I'm not surprised as Mr. Bourdain is known for his infatuation of all things pork. However, the restaurant is about more than pork; it's about indulging in all things rich and comforting. The main menu is filled with a meaty assortment of pork, beef, and duck dishes (vegetarians need not enter). Foie gras even has its own section as a ""meat"" with over 10 menu items...a foie gras lover's dream! The restaurant has a lively yet laid-back feel. It is non-descript (no sign outside) but full of warmth as sunlight from the large windows and skylights cast a glow on the honey-colored wood throughout the dining room. The staff also provided excellent service in an easygoing manner. It was good to be in such a comfortable environment as I let go and ate myself senseless...Foie Gras Poutine - poutine is to Canada as what chili-cheese fries are to the South. Up here, the Canadians top french fries with gravy and cheese curds...and Chef Picard then takes it one step further by adding a velvety slab of foie gras on top of it all. The gravy on this poutine was ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING! I don't know if I can adequately describe it...imagine a gravy that's thick, buttery, warm, creamy, and oh-so-savory, then multiply that goodness by 1,000. I cant' get over how good it was! Needless to say, I did not leave a single drop of gravy on the plate. Plogue à Champlain - deliciously addictive! This dish consisted of a buckwheat pancake topped with cheese, potatoes, thick-cut bacon, and foie gras. And on top of that was Quebec maple syrup, chopped apples, and parsley. The contrasting sweet and savory flavors were in perfect harmony. It was like having dinner and dessert wrapped up in an exceptionally decadent bite! [I'm literally salivating as I write about this!] Seafood Platter - the restaurant had a huge display of fresh/live seafood, so I thought it'd be a good idea to ""balance"" our heavy courses with a seafood platter...little did I know it'd be a gigantic mound of seafood! It was a heaping assortment of stuffed mussels, conch, razor clams, calamari, cherrystone clams, oysters, and even bowl of periwinkles sauteed in black bean sauce. Prepared with a number of different sauces and marinades, this was much more elaborate than the typical raw seafood platter. It's now clear why this dish wasn't served first. I did find all this seafood to be overwhelming though, and would have rather had the option to choose a few seafood items from the menu instead. Dark Chocolate Pot de Crème - Luckily, I always have an extra stomach for dessert so I didn't miss out on this luscious chocolatey goodness. It was so scrumptious with the graham cracker crumblesThe restaurant also served this terrific spearmint green tea by Kusmi. I liked it so much that I found it online and ordered some afterwards. Too bad I can't have that orgasmic poutine and plogue shipped to me as well. For now, I guess I'll have to longingly count the days until my next visit to Au Pied de Cochon.**For pics of each course, go to my blog linked under my profile. Enjoy!**"

APDC sets the bar up so high that I could hardly find any restaurants in Chicago that could get even close to it. APDC is daring and unconventional - just don't expect to find your regular coq au vin or poulet roti grand mere *yawn*. Picard's cuisine is meant to shock. There are plenty of items in the menu that one would never thought of eating. How about some head cheese or bison tongue to start the meal? Entree? Well, duck cooked in a can or some heart-attack-inducing blood sausage and foie gras pie sound absolutely delish! As gross as it may sound to other people, every single meal at APDC ends with a sense of fulfillment. Not just the appetite but the need for someone to prove me wrong for coming to dine with a preconception of what's gross and what's not. Well, folks, there's no need to worry about the dessert part of the meal. They are not going to sneak some trout into your ice cream like the Iron Chef. But they are to die for! Look no further because they have the best, freshly made, lemon meringue pie on the face of the earth - hands down.The service is second to none. It feels like a friends/family gathering at APDC. The servers & captains are extremely disciplined and super hot. We ordered with the captain but the servers knew exactly what our orders were. The cutlery were perfectly set and the food arrived exactly where they were supposed to be. No questions asked. I dropped my fork and I got another one literally, in five seconds. The restaurant was packed and they were super busy. Yet, they care about details like these. Now, that's excellent service!I have never been disappointed with APDC and I have got to say that this is the best restaurant I've ever been in my life. I don't give a lot of 5 stars but if I could give it a 10, I would.

The portion is really huge and you might do well sharing this instead.Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce  -  I have never seen so much mushroom served with duck magret before!  It was not a ""SAUCE"" as much as a generous serving of sliced mushroom piled on top of the beautifully seared duck.  Nice touch. The duck was tender and cooked to perfection.Order your desserts early cos they might just run out of what you want.  The pecan pie was delicious - lots of nuts and smooth syrup base without the gritty sugar bits you get from some pies.The service can get kinda slow but the food makes up for it.  Try it if you are in Montreal and remember to make your booking early.  They were recently reviewed in the NYT and are getting alot of attention from visitors to the city."
/user_details?userid=0mKrWvUyg2WitVlQ5MiQDA,F D.,"Middlesex, MA",5 star rating,"Dear Yelp,I propose a special 6th star that I can award to establishments like Au Pied De Cochon.  In a world full of mediocrity, PDC shines above all in Montreal....can I please have that 6th star now??Here's the thing: this is a place you have to experience to appreciate. My verbal abilities can't really do the food, service, and atmosphere justice. But what I can say is this: this is the kind of rare place you wish time would stop during your meal and you can keep hitting rewind over and over again before you get the check, a restaurant that feeds all senses, not just one (or two).   The food I have enjoyed there reminds me of all the wasted valuable time and money eating everywhere else, ever.  So, do yourself a favor and try to make it to PDC, at least once!   Don't bother looking for a sign outside with the restaurant's name, there aint one."

This place is down to earth and just serves tasty food. The service was awesome and and they made wonderful recommendations. The pricing was reasonable all the way around which was another surprise. They had a nice spectrum of prices on wine and reasonable beer prices. I'm hoping that the red wine I drank can dissolve all the animal fats I consumed as I had a truly decadent meal. We sampled the fois gras poutine which was sinfully delicious, the duck in a can, the pied de cochon and the pudding dessert. Everything was pretty darn good and I would eat it all again in a heart beat! I don't consider myself to be a big carnivore, but I couldn't get enough of this tender succulent meat. I need to go back to sample the seafood and bison which also looked intriguing. So much to eat and so little time."
/user_details?userid=LIC4dNWeO1lbe6jL370Itg,Neena S.,"Concord, CA",5 star rating,"We had heard about PDC and were prepared to be skeptical. However, the restaurant FAR exceeded our expectations and was good value to boot!First let's start with the service.  There has to be a higher wait-staff to customer ratio than any restaurant I have ever been in.  Also, they use a service system I had only experienced in much smaller cafes and such: you have a personal staffer in charge of your dinner, but whenever a dish or drink is ready, whoever is available brings it. This means dishes get to you quickly, fresh and hot. It also means that anyone can respond to your needs: you don't have to flag down ""your"" waiter for a question or request. Consequently, the service was outstanding.Our waiter was very helpful, suggesting a daily special [a variety of sausages and head cheese] and cautioning against two orders of the Tarte de boudin.  So the partner had an hors d'oeuvre plate of  sausages, and I had a beet and goat cheese salad [Salade de betteraves et chèvre]. It was actually like a cold lasagne of beets and herbs and goat cheese. Excellent, almost a meal in itself.The Tarte de boudin was amazing. Although it looked something like a small pizza, the crust was a delicate, flaky, pastry crust-- as tasty as i've had anywhere. in the ""topping"" mix were carmelized onions, mashed potatoes, and slices of the most delicious boudin. One order was more than enough for both of us, and there was no way we could have eaten dessert. I had a glass of Bourgogne Aligote [no California wines here....] and the partner had a Cream Ale. In total, our bill [with a very generous tip] was less than $60. [Canadian]."

We showed up and were immediately shown to our table, which was a nice surprise given how crowded the restaurant was at that time. We were seated next to the station where waiters pick up the food, cut bread, etc. It was interesting to see how they do their jobs, but it was definitely where our attention was, instead of on each other and conversation.Nonetheless, started with duck carpaccio. It was amazing. Very rich with the egg yolk and olive oil, but such a smooth taste. I definitely recommend it. My friend had duck in a can, which is fois gras, duck breast, and cabbage cooked together in a can. It's served with a very rich, dark sauce, with some whipped cauliflower on a crostini. It was very rich and heavenly. I had duck with mushroom sauce. Again the sauce was so rich and earthy, and the duck was cooked beautifully. They serve you alot of food, so we didn't have any sides. I'm glad we didn't, as we were stuffed as it was.Other reviews mentioned the hostess having an attitude towards english speakers and the waiters being indifferent. We are American and did not get that feeling at all. Hostess was nice, person that did my reservation over email was nice, waiters were nice. They just aren't that into refilling your wine and asking how you are doing every few minutes....but they are nice and get you your food....that's all I can ask for.In my opinion this place is a MUST go in Montreal, and if I ever visit again, I will be back!"

Food is ridiculously good and bad for you.  But its so good that you won't even care.We ordered:-Foie Gras Cromesquis (fried balls filled with liquified foie gras.  Awesome)-Plogue Au Champlain (foie gras appetizer that will blow your mind--pancake, slice of boiled potato, canadian bacon, and melted cheddar, all topped with a large patty of seared foie gras, surrounded by maple syrup.  So.  Delicious.)-Tarragon Bison Tongue (amazing texture, cooked perfectly)-Happy Pork Chop (big, simple, and delicious)-PDC's Melting Pot (large pot filled with blood sausage, pork belly, and two other kinds of meat, sitting on top of a pile of mashed potatoes)It was all really, really good.  Go in with a ready-to-eat mindset and you won't be disappointed.  Pants with an elastic waistband might be a good idea.  Oh, also, their house beer is pretty good and refreshing with pounds and pounds of foie gras and pork.Service is good, too!  If it weren't for fears of clogged arteries we would've returned every night.My only regret is not ordering the duck in a can.  Next time!"

If you get there and you don't know what to get, go ahead and tell them to prepare a menu for you.In this menu, we had the Duck Carpaccio, which was simply fabulous. Melt in your mouth, exactly what a carpaccio should be.  We also had the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, as one of ours doesn't eat that much game and ""weird"" food.  A beet and goat cheese salad is so yesterday for me, but this was so well presented, as a little tower, and the flavors were just melted together, and it was probably the best beet salad I have ever had.We had another salad after that, the squab giblets salad, which was also very flavorful and very precise in terms of taste and temperature.  As for our main, The Canard en Conserve, which is a duck leg confite served in a can, that they open at your table and dump on your plate.  The smell was so fantastic.  The slow cooked cabbage in the dish reminded me of my childhood.  A nice piece of foie gras was inserted under the skin, all for a fabulous mix of unforgettable savoriness.They have a nice wine list too, and the markup isn't exagerrated.Quite fantastic!"

I've read the reviews and was very curious to try it and I have to admit it is really worth all its hype. AND! This comes from someone who hated foie gras before going there! As many have noted below, you have to make reservations in advance, I would suggest to call them as soon as you know that you will be going to Montreal. We called a week in advance and the earliest spot they had was 10.30 p.m. on a Sunday night. We got there at 9.30 and they said that we could eat at the bar if we don't want to wait for our 10.30 reservation, we agreed and it was so much fun! You can actually see the cooking process because of the open kitchen, it was a really great experience. That said -- it's by no means a romantic spot. Atmosphere is very cool - it's crowded, noisy and  fun! Service is great and friendly.  Food is OUTSTANDING to say the least. Very unusual combination of flavors! The food is very rich, but honestly, I didn't feel stuffed/sick after I had appetizers, main course and dessert. It was a nice, delicious and very memorable dinner.We had pickled tongue and  duck carpaccio as appetizers which were beyond amazing. Duck carpaccio comes with raw egg on top which you mix with dijon mustard right on the plate - very different and soooo good! My boyfriend had duck in a can, which was terrific - he saved the can as a souvenir! I had Plogue a Champlain - pancake with potatoes, bacon, cheddar and foie gras topped with maple syrop - it was absolutely amazing. Even though  it was a little too sweet for my taste, I was very happy with the flavors. Desserts were very good too! I also thought it was really affordable, the bill was under $150 for dinner for two with wine, apps and two desserts - pretty good!Forget about this place if you:-count calories -are vegetarian-don't eat certain foods-are looking for a quiet romantic dinnerFor any foodie, this place is a MUST to say the least. I just came back from Montreal and am already thinking when I should go again to try something new on their menu :)"

Au Pied De Cochon is all of these things.This was our pick for the only fancy dinner  we'd have in Montreal, and I have no regrets there. The great thing about this restaurant is that it feels very casual and cozy. No snobbiness here.Things we ordered:* Duck in a Can: Seems to be a popular dish, and yes it really comes in a can. The result is a big bowl of richness. Make sure you order some bread or something else on the side to give your taste buds a break.* Lamb Shank: Way better than Duck in a Can in my opinion. Again, another rich dish but there's all sorts of other things (like some awesome tomatoes) to have fun with.For appetizers we had the foie gras (excellent) and some beef carpaccio (OK). I could have skipped out on the latter to make more space for the entrees. Which reminds me... The entrees are very big, so don't get crazy ordering a bunch of appetizers.Also note, the difference between appetizers and the starters... starters are one bite each.Great place for a memorable dinner, but be prepared to splurge."

My friend ordered the Melting Pot which had close to everything but the oink of the pig and he was in Hog Heaven. My other friend had the duck breast in red wine I believe, and he thoroughly enjoyed his plate. I thoroughly enjoyed nibbling from both plates, though I stayed away from the blood sausage in the melting pot. What really got me though was the desert, gosh that was heaven. We ordered the Pouding Chomeur (Poor Man's Pudding) was heaven, like eating a cloud, I'm in love. Topping off an already ridiculously good dinner."

The fat doesn't escape the food in a way that would leave your plate, fingers, napkin soaked through. It's fattening sure, but it's not greasy. Thoughtful and flavourful, this food is that perfectly tender, melt-in-your mouth fare that it's all hyped up to be. Considering how upscale the ingredients are and presentation is, you'd expect to pay more but the price is actually quite more than reasonable. Started with the cromesquis (bited sized squares of hot and runny duck fat encapsulated in deep fried batter-- get one, get two!!), indulged in duck in a can (topped with the biggest chunk of fois I've ever seen) and split a bottle of red, all for under $65. There's no needs for sides. I'm completely boggled that some people order french fries on the side of their pieds de cochons. The portions are massive and there's no looks when you order a doggy bag. Service for me was fast and the staff was hospitable without being annoying. This place is regularly touted as the best restaurant in Montreal, and I'm right there with those that proclaim it as such. This place is single-handedly rewriting the history of quebec gastronomie.

/user_details?userid=vlOv8IhA2cMHe3vov39hQw,Tony M.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Whether you're in Lima or Napoli, Southern European and Southern American cities have similarities, they still have bustling produce, fish and meat markets with restaurants that blend in with the chaos. Wooden tables without napkins. Sturdy cutlery. Pots, pans, dishes, and plates in all sorts of shapes and textures, just like the patrons. Layers of seafood on ice along the bar. And of course, the sizzling of onions and shallots (the aromatic of choice for French cuisine) filling the dining room. Patrons gossiping and boasting about their lives, all in all an orgy of noises and smells.The problem is, we are not in Sao Paolo, but in Montreal, in the bowels of Le Plateau. This is chef Martin Picard's Au Pied de Cochon. The acclaimed Chef attaches his beginnings to Montreal going back to the early 1990's.The raison d'etre of Au Pied de Cochon is to delight its customers, as much through its exquisite food as through its friendly atmosphere. When it is a question of pure pleasure, one would have a hard time convincing that the feeling of fresh vegetables cracking in your mouth, as good as it may be, is as pleasurable or as intense as a piece of meat, cooked perfectly, especially at the moment it releases its fat and its juices, filling the body with warmth an instantaneous feeling of well being. One thus goes to Au pied de cochon for the comforting pleasures of a meat-plentiful and generous kitchen, terroire inspired. Martin Picard is a larger-than-life character, for whom eating well means eating a lot, and drinking well means drinking a lot.Like the changing temperatures of the seasons, the kitchen at Au Pied de Cochon offers a variety of seasonal fare. Without giving up the pillars of the meat repertoire that characterizes the restaurant, Martin Picard's french bistro cuisine includes a large number of fish and seafood dishes. During the winter the menu goes through a dramatic transformation.Most dishes have only four or five easily identifiable ingredients, in balanced proportions. Chef Martin Picard does get clever with one pervasive product: foie gras. It comes in nearly a dozen combinations, including stuffed into a ham hock, with poutine, and in an interesting creation called ""Duck in a Can"" which does, indeed, come to the table with a can opener. Somehow! this canned duck provided us with succulent meat without any of the chewy fat that is usually expected. After having magret de canards in Montreal in the past, none have come close to satisfying me like this dish.  A heap of mushrooms and onions covered the deep colored duck strips, which were teased to perfection by the chef. The main courses are for carnivores and pescivores. We were tempted by but did not try any of the large plates of seafood on a bed of crushed ice. The zucchini flowers were delicately fried and sprinkled with fleur de sel, and the calamari was light and citrus filled accompanied by caviar.When you feel like another bite will send you into a cholesterol-induced coma, maple syrup cake is the only fitting finish.This is not an establishment for sensitive stomachs and underperforming livers!"

Even if they are fully booked while we were in Montreal so we ordered take-away!Maybe the duck has been in the can too long (a 10 min walk), it was tough. The foie gras poutine was not bad but not fantastic.The meal was too rich for my liking. A bit disappointed bcos ducks and foie gras are my 2 loves.But i am still glad i tried it and judged for myself! How can I be a food lover and not try the famous Au pied de cochon, even if it did not live up to my expectations?"

Seating was very cramped, but in full view of the kitchen, which made the experience much more enjoyable. Food was good, but expect to spend $$$. Oh, and make reservations EARLY. The night before my reservation someone offered me $500 for it, so that's a good indication of the popularity of the place."
/user_details?userid=5adYZXIY5-ZvdKSfC4QIDg,Jennie C.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Not sure what went wrong...maybe all these stellar reviews got my expectations too high. Came in on Tuesday night without reservations, but was able to get seated at the bar within minutes. The bartender was very friendly and patiently answered my questions. I ended up getting the PDC salad, which was various pork bits sprinkled on salad greens. It also came with a square of fried pork knuckles & marrow & other goodness with a smear of spicy mustard. While the salad was nice & fresh, I think the choice of greens was too soft to stand up to the heavy pork bits. The pork was nicely flavored and tender. Didn't really like the fried pork knuckles though.Since I wasn't too hungry I ordered a foie gras tart rather than one of the meat dishes. Maybe that was my downfall. The tart was basically puff pastry with garlic mashed potatoes and slices of foie gras. I found it too greasy for my liking and the foie gras had none of the rich complex flavors I was expecting. Sadly this was a disappointment for me. And if you go, don't wear anything you can't wash, because you'll come out smelling like fried pig fat (not necessarily an offensive smell, but something to keep in mind...)."

Be prepared to have your mouth hugged.Yes, this is not a restaurant you should visit on a strict diet. It's the kind of place you should go to if you've only had a banana all day because it's impossible to leave there with any room in your stomach.Martin uses local, fresh ingredients and produce and doesn't spare anything. The flavours are rich, well-thought and there is such care to his meals. My favourite meal is the Duck in a Can by far. Start with a Foie Gras lollipop and you'll never try anything else.It's refreshing to find a place in Montreal that concentrates on simple flavours instead of trying to cloud a dish with creamy sauces and spices.Be prepared to spend about $40 on your main course and don't even think about wine unless you've hit the video lotto jackpot the night before.Happy Eating!"

First off let me say that parking is a hassle in this area, my husband drove around for 30 minutes before finding a spot. I realize that this isn't a reflection of the food and service, just something to watch out for. We arrived at 7 PM with no wait time! That was a big plus due the fact that it was packed. I ordered the Poutine au Foie Gras. It was extremely rich and heavy. I did enjoy it but it definitely was not worth the $24. My husband ordered the Melting Pot. It was filled with different sausages, mushrooms, and potatoes. He said it was good but he wished he knew what kind of sausages he was eating, as our waitress did not explain the dish very well. She was extremely scripted and made us feel rushed while ordering. The meal was around $100 for two. Overall, I am pleased we made the decision to try this place out but I probably would not consider it again."

/user_details?userid=jo_YcCmDdVHg-U8fjgzxkA,Clifford R.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"This is one of those reviews where I wonder if I missed something, everyone seems head over heels in love with au pied de cochon, but I was not that impressed.  First, the service and décor.  The service was pretty slow, we were there for about 3 and a half hours.  There had to be at least a 45 minute wait between our apps and our entrees.  Our waitress was polite and friendly, but wasn't around that often.  She did help pick a great bottle of wine after my original choice was no longer available.  My water glass was empty quite a few times, but that's a busboy issue.  The décor and layout was a bit odd, they obviously made the conscientious decision to choose cramming as many people in as possible over comfort and style.  Second, the food.  I'm really torn about how to describe the food.  I think the best way is to say that each item was one of the most delicious things I've ever had - for the first 1 - 2 bites.  After that, it got gross kinda quick.  I am no stranger to rich foods, and I subscribe to the French (or Paula Deen) school of thought that cooking with butter makes everything better, but this food was just over the top.  I started with a Duck Carpaccio. Carpaccio is usually light and fresh and this one was too, until I broke the egg yolk over the entire dish as instructed.  Then it just got creamy and all the flavors got muddled and didn't really work well together.  Someone else ordered the Foie Gras Poutine, and I really couldn't stomach much more than a few bites.  Again, I have to think I'm missing something here because everyone raves about it.  To me, it's taking something completely trashy like Disco Fries and trying to class it up by adding some Foie Gras and cheese curds.  The duck in the can was undercooked and again, completely over the top with Foie (apparently the duck is supposed to come out under done according to the wait staff).  The main entrée was the rabbit special for 2 - 3 people.  It's a whole rabbit, with the head braised in red wine, two legs sous-vide (I believe), two legs roasted, and the remainder of the rabbit rolled and stuffed with foie and roasted / baked, all served over a creamy polenta.  The roasted legs were amazing, but moving onto the torso sections, the meat was completely overpowered by the foie.  All in all it seems that the point of this restaurant is to eat as much Foie Gras as possible.  It's not done in a classy way, where a little goes a long way, but an in your face Foie Gras fest.  Maybe it's unfair for me to rate au pied de cochon based on not liking a specific type of food (i.e. Poutine) - especially without having any other point of reference, but I think the over the top ideology of throwing Foie Gras around like it's rosemary or salt and pepper is really the underlying issue here.  I just don't get this place."

/user_details?userid=H6Wb724E3agy8NO6SpPACw,Jon H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I first heard about this place through a friend who had invited me to his birthday dinner at this place.  I hadn't heard too much about it prior to this but when I saw how packed the place was even at 11pm at night, I knew that there had to be something special about this place.   Decor wise, there was nothing particularly fancy: modern rustic - it felt like you wanted to be there to eat-- and eat we did.Starters: -the table (of 8) shared an entire foiegras that was pan fried and then doused in some cheese sauce and served with a baguette.  Pretty amazing.- french onion soup Au Pied De Cochon (APDC) style. Hands down the best french onion soup I've ever had.  the reason: BACON/Pork Chunks.- foie gras poutine.  Sounds weird but it works.  For those uneducated in Quebecois cuisine, Poutine is a dish comprised of french fries, cheese curds and gravy.  APDC just added foie gras to the mix and BAM, heaven in your mouth and a punch to your arteries.Main course:- I got the Duck in a Can which is their take on a Duck confit but of course, with Foie gras (do you see an underlying theme at this restaurant?) which they somehow cook and then stuff it in a can and then open it at your table on top of a dish of celery root puree.  Needless to say i did not make it to dessert but I was feeling more than satisfied with every bit of my meal.I've been back since and always tend to over eat.  Their Foie Gras stuffed pig's foot is something to try too.   I'd probably share some dishes next time i go but DEfinitely go if you enjoy food.  It is not for the picky eater.and if you are vegetarian, you shouldn't even be reading this review let alone have clicked on this link for the restaurant."

Place probably deserves 5 stars, but since I was dealing with a upset stomach I didn't get to fully enjoy it.You have seen it on TV, read about in the NY Times and foodie (still hate that word) blogs. Now is your chance to try PDC, or at least mine.I decided that for the grand prix weekend this year I forgo one case of beer and go and have a nice dinner. PDC had been on my radar for about 2 years. I knew I was going for fresh butchered Piggie and Fois Gras Poutine, but was going to play it by ear.We arrived 10 minutes late for our 11pm reso, no problem and our party of 6 was sat promptly. Nice lay out open kitchen, it smelled if rich meats.The seafood platter looked amazing but due to the groups stomach issues we decided to go with the roast piglet, cod fish fritters and smoked sausage. It was amazing. For entrees the some had the Pork Chop served on the bone( it looked amazing), another had the steak, which looked perfect. And I had the melting pot a bowled filled with yummy pig products, there was lion chop, rib chops, sausage and Blood Sausage (pig blood sausage) over I think cheesy potatoes! There is reason that place has been called one of the best in Montreal they making good food for good prices!

/user_details?userid=LRI0mAoTfhWIhU1FBIJ0cQ,Christine L.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Oh Montreal... how to sum you up food wise. Eat as much as you can, purge so you can eat some more. If I could I would spend as much money as I could at this restaurant, Au Pied de Cochon. An incredibly famous eatery to those who are foodies, it is the devilish child of the ridiculously insane chef Martin Picard. This restaurant, like many others I have reviewed, can be summed up as a vegan nightmare. A menu completely in French and relatively unfriendly to vegetarians, if you are a carnivore looking for something more, come to this restaurant. Moreover, don't take a skinny girl here. Okay, that's a bit much but don't take a girl here who is expecting to ""eat light."" That's the stupidest thing you can do.Located on a little street somewhere in the middle of Montreal off of St. Denis, this restaurant as my friend mentioned ""doesn't even need a sign."" It is that popular. Rated as one of the best restaurants in a foodie city like Montreal, you better expect to see your respective religious deity when you bite into this food. So let's just say my standards were high. I mean, pole vaulting high. Advice: reserve a table. If you're planning on going or just thinking about going reserve a table, now. The place doesn't seat many people and it has a notorious reputation for being a fantastic restaurant so, yes, reservations are heavily advised. Off of the nitty gritty details and onto the food. If you want to read about this experience feel free. If you're looking for whether or not you should go? Yes. Just go. But be warned, you will spend a lot of money and then you will want to go back to spend more. My friend and I started off with a veal bone marrow with caviar, served with a slice of bread in some sweet nectar of the gods. Now, I'm a fan of bone marrow and for those of you who are cringing at the thought of it. I shake my head at your sad sad life without the joys of trying the buttery, mouth-watering substance. It is, if cooked properly (and yes it was cooked beyond properly here) it is divine. The slice of bread it came with was toasted with what seemed to be honey and the caviar gave an amazing little bitterness but the bone marrow... I'm salivating just remembering it. The entire combination of the bone marrow, caviar, and sweet slice of bread was mind-bogglingly good; the epitome of artistic creation and the love of food in one entrée (appetizer if you're American). My friend and I scooped as much of the marrow out as we could, like @$*%ing vampires. My main was, naturally, pork. With a title like Au Pied de Cochon, I had to try their ""cochon"" (pig for non-French speakers). I decided on their La Coupe, or cut of tenderloin. I don't know what it was exactly, but it was big, covered in an onion, mushroom, and (I think) red wine reduction and made me realize why food is one of life's initial pleasures. From what I understand, it is incredibly difficult to bake pork without it getting dry. I must admit, my pork was a bit drier than I would've preferred but hell, it was 0.5 kg of meat. That's over 1 lb of piggy pleasure. Now I'm not skinny, but I'm not enormous, I'm also 5'1 and I managed to eat the majority of my main. PRIMARILY because it was just so damn good. The one thing is, if you order this there is a 45 minute wait but in my opinion it is well worth it.Now my friend ordered the Foie Gras Hamburger (again, vegan nightmare), which was what I really wanted to try. Hesitantly, he let me try his rather expensive dish, and when I had it the foie gras melted. Despite being a near impossible burger to hold, it was fatty and delicious, and heart-stoppingly (in a good way) delectable. In the end, when it came to dessert we couldn't fit another bite. I remember sitting there watching the cooks work, my friend (a chef) pointed out each task each person did. As an open kitchen you can see these men prepare your meal for you right there. As someone who has never been but has read about the food industry, this kitchen, the restaurant works like a restaurant should and serves food like most restaurants should. Despite the high quality of food, it doesn't have the snooty attitude that usually is associated with fine dining. The men in the kitchen are all tattooed, the waiters are in t-shirts. It looks like your average restaurant but it is so much more than that. If you are like me and enjoy the restaurant world and can appreciate it from the outside, I insist you come to Au Pied de Cochon. Watch the high octane but fluid movements of the cooks and take a piece of what you can out from your experience. All in all, I will be going back, no doubt. From this essay of a review, Au Pied de Cochon is in a class of it's own with an atmosphere of its own. The food, though heavy, is amazing. If people knew about the chef who started this restaurant, they would understand the menu better. In essence, M. Picard is saying ""Go big or Go Home."" Go. It is worth the money you'll spend."

There seemed to be some communication issues between front of house and the kitchen... they were out of a lot of desserts, but we only found out after we ordered and the server took the order. There were too many specials, at least a dozen, I love specials, but I draw the line somewhere around 5. I felt sorry for my poor server! House brew is great and a decent price. The pates and meat platters are to die for. The maki special was excellent too, if a little strange for a French place.

We also had an incredible mushroom and cheese tartlet with a perfectly dressed side of greens.

We had a mistake with the order, so when we finally got the steak frites we were slightly disappointed - the steak was undercooked and the cut of meat wasn't the greatest - it also had the same mushroom sauce, so it would have been nice to know that in advance. The french fries were perfectly cooked though. For dessert we had pudding chomeur - a biscuit surrounded by cream and hot maple syrup.

I never thought the maple syrup would go well but it did.  The sweetness was perfect for foie gras.For entrees, we had the ""Duck in a can"" and the foie gras with pig's feet.  Both of which were amazing.  The Duck in a can is really a sight to see.  The waiter comes by with a plate that has potatoes and some cabbage.  And a hot can on the side.  He opens the can and then dumps the contents, which is duck and foie gras, onto the plate.  The presentation itself is enough to make heads turn.   The foie gras with pig's feet was really good too.  It was in a very hearty mushroom sauce.  It tasted like home.  The meat was falling off the bone.Both entrees were delicious.  They were both very hearty.  Don't over order when you come here or else it would feel heavy.  We were too full for dessert :)  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."

Overall we had a wonderful experience that I'll never forget. The food was superb with artful presentations served in a warm, inviting and modern atmosphere. The stars of this menu are the Foie Gras & Pork dishes but everything we tried was atleast excellent with some plates reaching perfection.The food:Starters - Fresh Warm Bread & Butter- A great start to our meal. The bread was thickly sliced with a crispy crust and soft interior. This ame with cold butter.Beef Tartare - I loved this dish. The presentation was perfect as it was served in 2 Sushi-style ""Temaki"" nori hand rolls with crispy onion shoe strings, warm rice, lucious beef tartare topped with a quail egg in it's shell with sesame seeds on top. You poured the quail egg and sesame seed mix on top. I couldn't get over the marriage of flavors. It was devine.Entrees:Duck In A Can - Medium rare Duck, Foie Gras, Thyme & Balsamic Jus served over Mashed Potatoes & Toast. The presentation was whimsical as our server used a can opener tableside and spun the contents of the cooked can over a plate of Mashed potatoes over toast. The flavors were nearly perfect. I loved everything about this plate with the only exception being that the duck skin was a little rubbery and gelatinous instead of crispy. Otherwise it was sublime.Pork Chop with Red Cabbage & Onions - My wife ordered this and it didn;t disappoint. This dish was simple in presentation but big on flavor. I loved the balnce of red cabbage and onions with the moist chop. It really elevated thedistinct and smoky flavor of the pork.Side:Frites cooked in Duck Fat - These were without a doubt the best fries I've ever had. Simply amazing. Served in a paper cone with a side of mayonnaise. The fries were crisp on the outside and hot and soft in the center. We skipped the mayonnaise and dipped them in the jus from our entrees. These paired with the Duck In A Can beautifully.Dessert:Dark Chocolate Pot de Creme - I love dark chocolate and I love dessert. This was a warm chocolate pudding topped with whipped creme and buttery cake crumbs served in a jar. It was rich and decadent.Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - We paired this with out Pot de Creme and it provided the perfect balance of flavor and temperature. It was the perfect end to our meal @ APDC.Overall we had a wonderful time @ APDC. It was without a doubt the most relaxing, fun and enjoyable fine dining experience I've ever had.

I just remember that we had a lot of foie gras dishes and duck. I believe the best was the Foie Gras Poutine. I can drink a gallon of that gravy. Usually duck and foie gras are not exactly my cup of tea, but it was amazing here. I was just watching Anthony Bourdain and he just mentioned foie gras, so it triggered my memories in Montreal. Definitely would come back and eat here again... and again... and again."

The memorable dishes were:the Foie Gras Comesquis which are basically fried balls of foie gras that explode (literally) in your mouth. If you like foie gras, this is the starter for you! Second: the Plogue a Champlain. This was probably my favorite thing we tried. The sweetness of the maple syrup and the saltiness of foie gras and meat all combined was to die for! 2. The decor suits the food (warm/rich) and I liked how you could see the kitchen from the dining area. 3. Service was classy and they recommended great dishes for us. However, the restaurant made my reservation on the wrong day. So we showed up and were told it was a no-go but since I did make the reservation and swore I made it the right day, they gave us a table. phew!CONS:1. It's quite pricey but in this case, you get what you pay for :) !2. You need to make reservations like a week in advance. OVERALL:-It's a great place for foie gras and to indulge in outrageously heavy, rich, delightful food. -It's a place to go at least once.

This place though, has so many creative takes on good high end foie gras that results into one thing, good. Plain and simple. I like poutines, they're alright. But I thought I'd enjoy them best when I'm plastered at 3 in the morning. This place though, thank you so much Martin, took it to a different level, Foie Gras Poutine. Travesty? Nope, it was the best dish among the Beef Tartare, Duck in a Can, and Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce we ordered. Not to say the other dishes weren't good. They were superb. But the flavors in the poutines went so well together I thought it was the best. Weird eh? Go try it out for yourself.I'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes.

First we got there and while walking through the dining area, the floors were extremely slippery.  The hostess actually warned us to be careful.  I guess with the open kitchen and the amount of cooking they do, the floor is hard to maintain. We started with a seafood platter that blew my mind.  This is not typical seafood that's cleaned and thrown on a bed of ice.  The items in this platter were carefully prepared combinations of sauces to ingredients married together in tasty bliss.  There were cooked snails in sauce, mini sea snails, sea urchin in light foam sauce, oysters, and more.  I love how each piece was a creation in itself.  I would go back just to try the other seafood platters. On the proteins.  Seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce is to die for.  The syrup stands strong with the foie gras flavor and blends together nicely.  The duck in a can was a combination of the best parts of the duck (more foie gras) and duck breast, in a rich sauce.  We also had the pig's foot, which normally my wife would not like, but this one had so many flavors working with it that it's simply amazing.  Everything exceeded my expectations.  And I would go back to try the other stuff I didn't get to.  If you're in Montreal, you must go.

Thumbs wagging.Main: duck in a can (ie, duck breast with a piece of foie and chopped celery and carrot slow cooked in a tin can and dumped on a piece of toast tableside)--this is a ""classic"" dish, and if classic meaning old, it sure is that.  As in, overrated.  Somewhat offputting is that the dish is served warm, not hot.  I know because I watched my can sit on the server's rack waiting to be picked up for about twenty minutes (not heat lamp, mind you).  Which made the piece of duck fat (larger than either the breast itself and the piece of foie) initmidating.  Chewy too, which comes from not being rendered from being heated in a sealed can.  But it's a classic, so order it by all means.  I'm not a fan, thumbs down.Dessert: fruit pudding (er, rather, diced pear and berries in a gratin dish baked with a piece of pastry)--yikes, talk about over-sweet.  Thumbs down down.Beer: six on tap, glasses chilled.  Thumbs up.Wines: by the glass, about six options for red and the same for white.  Thumbs up.Espesso: hey, it's an espresso, if you screw that up, you're not even on my radar.  Thumbs up.Two more points: singletons get to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen, which was great.  I wasn't bored for a second and the cooking crew genuinely seem to enjoy themselves.  Also, I was a bit annoyed that the host was not so subtle in recommending the heaviest and most expensive item from each part of the menu.  Now, as an economist would tell you, price is a valuable (ha) piece of information in conveying quality or demand relative to supply, but come on, a slight guy like me does not need to have seven courses (I didn't, obviously).  Unless you want me sick, which hopefully wasn't the idea.So, on average, a decent dining experience, but not transformative, not revelatory.  I'd go back for some things on the menu and because the ambience is great, but the best restaurant in Montreal is too high a claim from me."

If you want you can even eat healthy with nice roasted sea foods and salads. During the summer months there is also a fresh seafood ""bar"" offering  extravagant selections. Our most recent choices for our a table of six were mostly the standard PDC items with the Pig's foot swimming in gravy just OK, the duck magret very good and the standout this time the Ploque a Champlain, a crepe like pork and fois gras combination.PDC is a foodie mecca and is most always crowded with a well healed clientele ready to drop a few hundred bucks if need be to experience this place. On a hot summer night this past June the place was still rock'n after 11pm and we saw a few celebs at a nearby table. The staff were apologetically late with our table, we had to wait almost 45 minutes after the reserved time to be seated, but they made up for the inconvenience by leading a few of our party to the bar and providing some nice wine and an appetizer plate gratis. Very classy and unexpected. The servers were friendly,extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and were of the highest calibre which adds so much to the overall experience.

I didn't mind that the foie gras was in large somewhat gelatinous slices on top, but I could see how poutine traditionalists would be turned off by it. The tart was good as well and I couldn't believe the amount of foie gras and blood sausage for 28! Plus the tart itself was enormous! It was good, a bit soggy at the bottom, but good nonetheless. The foie gras, which I had a lot of, was good, but not the best I've ever had, which was somewhat disappointing after all the hype of this place. Everything was very rich and so with the big portions it was hard to finish - but no complaints about that!

My girlfriend and I came here and we had 7:30 reservations. We got there about 5-10 minutes early, but our table was not ready so we sat at the bar.  We ordered our wine and looked at the menu, deciding what we were going to eat. We had alot of questions and the wait staff was very happy to answer all of them. We were doing well, when i realized we had been sitting at the bar for half an hour with our table still not ready. Because of that they gave us a complimentary order of their fois gras croquettes (amazing one bite little morsel). Finally our table was ready and we sat. We knew what we had wanted so we ordered right away. I wanted the stuffed pig foot, and out waitress told us that it would take 45 minutes to prepare so we should order and appetizer if we were hungry. So we ordered the fois gras poutine. When the poutine arrived my jaw dropped. It was divine. But after we finished the poutine we waited....and waited...and waited for 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  We were getting a little impatient. But it was worth it. Keep in mind....the pigs foot can feed probably 4 people. It is the single most decadent dinner i have ever had. It is an arms length worth of fried boneless pork leg, on top of a mashed potato mixed with cheese (so stretchy) amd mushroom sauce. And for the cherry intop of it all...100 grams of more fois. I have reached my fois quota for the next 5 years. Of course i didnt finish it...it was massive. It comes in its own 18 inch casserole. That is how its plated! So once we boxed up our food we asked for the check. Our waitress comes back not only with our check, but two glasses and a bottle of calvados. She said that die to our really long wait for our table and oir food not only would be get complimentary calvados, but the poutine would be taken off the bill. They even offered to throw in a dessert (but we were way to full). THIS IS SERVICE!!!! They knew they were running behind, were incredibly apologetic (wait staff, hostess, general manager) and were very accommodating. Thank you so much for taking care of us.

For starters we had the APC ""salad"" (stupid me didn't realize this was simply a series of meats...very good....but too much given what was to come after).  I believe they had a fried cod special app that we tried that was excellent and fairly light. We also had one of their foie gras dishes, simply prepared, and that was excellent too.We killed two bottles of wine from the northern Rhone.  The first white I ordered they were out of so we started with a white St. Joseph (either rousanne or marsanne, if you like those varietals...I do) then moved on to a red St. Joseph (mostly Syrah).  These were both outstanding and you could spend a long time studying their wine list.The staff was very attentive and it was packed on the Wed night we went with a small line out the door.  We took a long, slow, half hour+ walk back to our hotel after this meal and that was the right call.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying more items from the menu.  Just don't you dare forget to order that rib chop!  You can cut it with a fork...Lastly, I think most of their prices are very reasonable.  Some are outright screaming buys.  So, good value overall for this type of place.  Make sure to put your reservation in at least a month in advance.Damn, we never did find out who that hot redhead was at the bar...."

We had heard about PDC for years and finally had a chance to go during a recent trip to Montreal. The first sign of trouble came right after we arrived. We were seated in what appeared to be a row of tables reserved for tourists right across from the bathroom. We thought about asking for a table at a less busy intersection, but decided not to put up a fuss. We were so excited to see the menu, and ordered a few appetizers and a couple of the classic mains. When we asked for a wine recommendation, the waitress was distinctly unhelpful. Again, we let it slide. The first small plates to arrive were amazing: deep fried foie gras fritters, beef tartare hand rolls. So far so good. Next came the oysters. They were great, but when we asked our server where they were from, he had no idea. Okay...Then we waited *more than an hour* for the rest of our meal. Meanwhile, a couple of guys at the bar (we were told they worked here) ordered a round of drinks for the staff, and we watched as they shotgunned beers in front of us. We expected the restaurant to be casual and unpretentious--this is definitely part of the brand. But cocky frat house antics? It was a little off-putting. And yet even this we were willing to overlook as we waited patiently for our meal to arrive...and waited...and waited. By then, our initial excitement had fizzled. When the food finally did arrive, we were tired and annoyed. The famed foie gras poutine, while certainly rich, was not as extraordinary as we had hoped--and ridiculously overpriced for what it turned out to be. No doubt, PDC has churned out several dozen of these a night, every night, for many years. Instead of the timeless classic we had hoped for, however, it all seemed a bit tired. We had initially planned to order a few more courses, but at this point we decided it was time to leave. When the bill came, we swallowed our pride and paid a ridiculous amount of money for what had turned out to be an utterly disappointing experience.

Chef Martin Picard brings classic Quebecois country style cooking to the city; not reinventing but more reintroducing urbanites to the wonders of pudding chomeur and Jesus ears. I suggest eating salad for breakfast and lunch on the day of your reservation... caloric intake will be equal to at least two days.

I sat at the bar and it was pretty nice chatting to the bartenders and waiters. They have reccomendations and extensive wine list. I order a glass of red wine, fried foie gras, PDC salad (pig, duck, chicken hearts) and foie gras poutine. The fried foie gras was mouth-watering. The waiter tells me to wait 45 seconds before placing it inside my mouth and chew with your mouth closed as the foie gras gush out leaving your mouth super satisfied. The PDC salad was huge and generous amounts of PDC for sure. Lastly, what I've been waiting for, foie gras poutine! It was love at first bite and every bite after. The seared foie gras was impeccable and simply melts inside your mouth. The cheese curd was chewy and had much flavor. The gravy complimented everything there and it was simply divine. I highly recommend this place!!!"

The city overall has such amazing food and Au Pied de Cochon is one of the best of them. As you may have read from previous reviews, the floor is little slippery. It was raining out and I was a bit concerned I was about to doing a triple lux inside the restaurant and fall but just walk slowly. You are going to want to walk slowly anyway to take in all the smells. It is magical inside the restaurant. We sat down and ordered appetizers and drinks. The Foie Gras Poutine was amazing. My girlfriend had the french onion soup. I had some of it and it was very tasty. After appetizers and rounds of drinks we did wait almost 45min to an hour for the entrees to come out. Honestly, that would really bother me any other time but after that first round of food I am not mad. I ordered the pied de cochon with stuffed with foie gras. Yeah just think about that for a minute. There really isnt anything to say. It was one of the most amazing dishes I have ever had. First of all the serving size was like 8 people. It was huge. Everything just melted together when you bit into the meat. It sat on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. My girlfriends cousin had a bison beef rib. It literally looked like the rib they threw on Fred Flintstones car and made it tip over.  My girlfriend had Duck In A Can. I don't know how they put that idea together but it was the best duck I have ever tasted. We didn't order any dessert after dinner but there were some interesting items on the dessert menu. A few minutes later the owner Martin Picard made an appearance. Said hello and shook his hand. Had a round of shots after that as well. Great guy. This is a must visit restaurant in Montreal. I can't wait to come back and try Martin Picard's other food venue The Sugar Shack."

It is definitely not the most exquisite stuff you get in haute cuisine places, but rather very hearty down-to-earth kind of food. Very good, very tasty. So if you want some simple french cuisine, this is the place to go. It can get crowded so hurry up to make a reservation. One tip, I went there with my friends who live in Montreal and they were not that impressed at all. They even didn't know that it existed. Conclusion, for locals, it's a typical restaurant, Old Port seems to have better places. Anyway, solid, and must be touristy hence the hype, good for bucket list."
/user_details?userid=leFBG4zac_p9HoO_zaGxyQ,Sandrine E.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,Be sure to make reservations at least a month in advance. I'll preface this by saying this place is probably on my list of top ten restaurants. We started off with onion soup and fois gras Poutine as appetizers...omg soo rich yet soo good! The onion soup had chunks of pork in it! I tasted a hint of beer as well. The flavors worked so well together. Next came our entrees which took about an hour. At first I was pretty annoyed but then got over it because I really needed the hour to digest from my appetizers to make room for my entree. I ordered the duck in the can. I decided to focus on the meat and nothing else because there was no way I could eat the entire entree. It was excellent. My BF got the stuffed pig leg with fois gras. If you plan on getting this please be advised this is probably a 3-4 person dish. My boyfriend barely put a dent in it before he asked them to wrap it up for him. My cousin got the bison ribs...it was HUGE!!! Very tasty!!! My other cousin got the fois gras burger which she wasn't too crazy about. A great bonus was the fact that we got to meet Martin Picard himself!!! He was soo friendly even allowed me to take a picture with him. If it wasn't for the slow service I would've given au pied cochon five stars however honestly the food definitely made up for it!!! Can't wait to come back for more!!!

Considering the fact we made reservations they seated us on time.. in a cramped little corner with barely enough space to move around. I could practically hear the breathing of the person in the next table beside me.. After we were seated we had to wait over 45 minutes (no exaggeration) for our orders to be taken... after that we sat there for another 1/1.5 hours in the cramped area to get our food !!!The food? This is why we went in the first place, the boyfriend and I LOVE trying new foods and are always open to new things but the food here? DISGUSTING !!!! We ordered bison ribs and duck magret in mushroom sauce... don't get me wrong, the mushroom sauce was divine but the duck itself was not cooked properly when I specifically asked for it to be done well and it made me sick.. the bison ribs the bf got were too sweet and on top of that had a STENCH that lasted in my nose til the next day... The staff didn't even come by to ask how the food was.. if they had I might have asked them to eat this and ask them if they considered this edible food. One thing that was good there was the fries that came with the meal... the bf and I ended up eating just that and leaving the rest... All in all, a horrible first dinner experience in Montreal because of this place. I would NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone in their right mind.. horrible service and horrible food. The reason people probably said it was too much too eat was because it was so disgusting that you just couldn't manage to eat it without throwing up (which we did by the way, after we got back to our hotel)... If after this you still wish to go, then by all means go for it.. but don't say you weren't warned !"

/user_details?userid=Fz5tCbWeljcGD8DA07uOCA,Trey G.,"Owings Mills, MD",5 star rating,"Let me preface this by saying that I am usually highly dissapointed by these Bourdain-hyped restaurants.  Au pied de cochon is the rare exception that did not fail.The beers, especially their namesake are awesome and very reasonably priced.  The ambiance is very casual but still nice enough to take the wife.We started with the cromesquis which were two small balls of fried foie.  Totally awesome as an amuse bouche.  We then shared the foie gras poutine which was ungodly good and the best poutine we had our entire stay in Quebec.   However, I do wish there were more fries to go along with the large portions of foie, curds, and gravy.  We ended up dipping our bread in the foie/curds/gravy to finish it off.We ordered the pied de cochon and PDC's melting pot.  The pied de cochon (pigs foot) was fantastic and was served with extremely rich and cheesy mashed potatoes.  The meat was crisp and covered in this oniony thick sauce which was a delight.  The PDC melting pot had blood sausage, regular sausage, pork chop, pork belly and was also quite nice.  Nothing to write home about, but the blood sausage and mashed potatoes were great in this dish.I remain curious about the duck in a can, but after a horrible duck experience the day before at another restaurant, we were not willing to fork out $45 for something that could be a bust.Will definitely be back to try to other menu items!"
/user_details?userid=sUrPKNNVAe2WLw3Lwu40IQ,Whitney J.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"My last meal in Montréal was a doozy. Friday evening, I made sure to walk over to Au Pied de Couchon when it opened in order to make a reservation for the weekend. Even as a single it was impossible to find a spot for Saturday, so Sunday it was. I took a shower, put on some makeup and took myself out on a date. In doing research for this trip, the internet screamed ""Au Pied de Couchon""! It's apparently extremely popular right now. However, I thought there would be a bit more couchon in my dish than there actually was. What this place is known for is their foie gras dishes. Had I known, I would have tried to get a reservation at Toqué or another restaurant that served high end local food. I have no regrets about this meal, however. Excellence, all around. The restaurant itself is a nice size- intimate without being cramped- warm and welcoming. The kitchen is open and gives off an air of controlled chaos that lends a more casual air to the whole ambiance. After being seated, I struck up conversation with the woman on my left, a fellow Los Angelina in town for business. She insisted I take some of her duck-fat fried french fries. I knew duck-fat roasted potatoes were good, but oh my god. These were insanely good. Crisp on the outside, flavorful-everything you want in a good french fry. My waitress recommended a Bergerac Cabernet Francais, which was exactly the perfect pairing. To start I ordered the Roast Piglet, served cold and thinly sliced with a tuna mayo. Yes, tuna mayo. I was apprehensive, but it was a perfect pairing. The pork was perfectly cooked and velvety with the mayo. I brought home the left overs, since it was a huge plate of meat, to give to the girls on duty at the hostel (yay new friends!) and they devoured it with as much surprised glee as I did. For my main I got the La Plogue à Champlain. Buckwheat pancake, potatoes, foie gras, maple syrup, thick cut maple cured bacon (which tasted more like lardo), and cheddar cheese. I thought this was going to be too rich, too much and it was rich, but really well balanced and not overwhelming at all. There was the perfect amount of salt and sweet to offset the richness of the foie gras and the earthiness of the buckwheat pancake rounded the whole thing out. The fatty bacon was so freaking good. Because of how it was cut and cured, it tasted more like a cured pork and lardo, as opposed to just bacon in a dish. It kind of blew my mind. It's pretty much impossible to pick out the individual ingredients in this dish. They just all meld together to attack your senses with a most pleasing result. I'm sure I made all sorts of happy noises as I ate. It happens, OK?I thought I couldn't eat any more after this. So much sweet! So much salty! So much foie gras! But my new friend to the left offered the uneaten half of her dessert and who am I to decline a gift of pot de crème au chocolat noir? Like everything else here, this is Rich. Definitely a dish to be shared. The velvety chocolate pudding was topped with graham cracker crumble and whipped cream. Pretty much perfection. Thankfully it wasn't too sweet, just the right balance of good chocolate flavor. A successful meal, entirely."

Worshipped by the New York Times, celebrity chefs, and self-described ""foodies"", Au Pied De Cochon has the reputation for being one of the best restaurants in the city.  It's undeserved. Here's my theory as to why the hype: it's greasy and unhealthy comfort food dressed up as haute cuisine for so-called foodies who claim to like fine dining when in reality they secretly crave greasy and unhealthy comfort food. In other words, it's fast food for pretentious people with big wallets. For all the ink that's been spilled over chef Martin Picard's ""masterful synthesis ""of the high and the low (a fusion of fine dining with blue collar working class grub), a poutine dressed up in foie gras is still just a poutine (only with more fat and cholesterol).  Call me unimpressed."

When we planned for Montreal, we looked at the most Yelped place and Au Pied De Cochon was it. With 200+ reviews and close to a perfect 5 star rating, we knew if we did even just one dinner, it had to be here. My girlfriend called right away to see if we could get a reservation since it was a couple weeks away from our trip. We got lucky! They had a reservation for the Friday we were getting in, but it was for 11 PM and we didn't care! We arrived about a half hour early to our reservation hoping they would seat us early, but they were so busy that they made us wait till 11 PM. The place has a very laid back atmosphere to it and the lighting is dim. Being that we were having such a late dinner after hours of exploring Montreal we were starved and ended up ordering a feast. From the Yelp reviews, we already knew we had to order the Duck in a Can ($43). When our waitress told us the specials, 2 things that stood out were the Clams in White Sauce and the Pigeon. We ordered those as well as a side order of Fries cooked in Duck Fat ($4.75). The Clams came out first followed up the Pigeon and Duck in a Can. We noticed into our meal that our fries hadn't come out yet and reminded the waitress who was very apologetic. Because I guess she forgot, the fries were on the house. Everything was delicious. The Clams were very fresh and the sauce it was in was soooo good. We were using the bread they gave us to sop up every single bit!  It was my first time having Pigeon and it was different. I was expecting it to taste like chicken but it didn't. Wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite either. The texture and taste were def different than chicken. The dish came with some vegetables. My girlfriends seemed to enjoy it so maybe it was just me. The presentation of the Duck in a can is cool. They bring out the can and open it at your table. Our waiter told us each can that is served was cooked about an hour earlier and then stuffed into the can and sealed. The can contains  1/2 Magret Duck, Foie Gras, Demi Glaze, Buttered Cabbage,  1/2 head of Roasted Garlic, and 2 Branches of Thyme. This was good but VERY rich. I loved the Foie. I'm glad that we had the Fries because I needed a different taste, something bland, which helped to balance these very rich dishes. Our waitress was great throughout the whole night. When we asked her where would be best to catch a cab, she called one for us. Great service!"

Attentive.Comesquis. Were a good start. Fois gras pout nu was also OK. Not special. Tomato tart was very average. Not unlike something you'd eat on a fast food pizza.My Bison rib was good. Vegetable accompaniment was beets tasting substandard. Also came with fries that were just ok. My wife's pork chop was so overcooked it was inedible. After returning to kitchen, the next try was deemed ok. While adequately cooked, the flavor reeked of onions. The pork taste never came through.Dessert was melted vanilla ice cream and ok tasting chocolate pudding. The red wine was also ok. Not great.For perspective, this was our fourth dinner in Montreal. All prior dinners ranged from superb .... Le Filet to Great....Les 400 coupes. Then along comes Au Pied De Cochon, touted as an absolute must. The reality is that APDC doesn't hold a candle to the top names in Montreal. It is resting on it's laurels. Martin Picard needs to reevaluate the current sad state of this place to return it to it's former glory.Until then, I won't return and can't recommend it.Having had the time  to sleep and rethink my review above, I can now clarify my negative feelings for  last night's meal.Previous reviewers have complained about the lack of service,  overwhelming richness of the food and cramped quarters. None of this applied in my case except for cramped quarters which took it's toll at the end of the meal ( more about that later ).This was a case of ill prepared , tasteless and poorly presented food. The only exception to this was the Cromesquis which were an enjoyable start to the meal.Foie gras pout nu.... This was not NAKED as advertised. It was covered with a thick balsamic reduction which totally overwhelmed the flavor. And far from being large ,the portion of foie gras was somewhat skimpy given the price.Tomato tartlet.....this dish lacked flavor. The tomatoes we're flavorless.very pedestrian dish. Happy Pork Chop.... As stated above, this was overcooked to the point of being inedible. The next version provided by the kitchen was cooked well but the preparation required seasoning and was overwhelmed by an onion taste..Bison Rib.... I thought it worked well enough. Just nothing to write home about .vegetables on the side were almost unidentifiable. French fries were ok to good.Wine... The selected  red wine tasted cooked. Just OKChocolate pudding....good but indistinguishable from other average versions.Vanilla ice cream. Hard to mess this up but it arrived half melted.As for seating.... we were seated in a 2 top at the front of the restaurant. This worked well enough until a large party arrived and were seated in front of our table along the window. Elders in the group required space to the point where the gentleman in back of me was now seated alongside of me and the woman to his side cramped my legroom as I was now pressed against my table not knowing whether to laugh or cry. I was exteremely uncomfortable as the hostess looked upon the situation with horror.I couldn't wait to leave. The manager approached. When I described the litany of my experience I focused on the kitchen line as the culprit. He , in the end, agreed. My bill came to 200 dollars. Not a bad price except when you consider how appalled we were by the quality of the food. As I stated above, when you compare APDC to the other top restaurants in Montreal, please be warned. Go elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=xzyJzjk5J5vweSJv27Jx5Q,jenilee p.,"Salem, MA",5 star rating,"unapologetically and obscenely decadent. this is a pilgrimage that every lover of foie gras and all things pork should make at least once in their lifetime. it is everything that you would expect: the experience of ingredients so dripping with awesome that even large, burly dudes suddenly begin to fear for the future state of their arteries. just like it sounds guys, dripping with awesome. i don't remember anything of the fine wine which we drank on that day except that it was red, and it was good, and there was a lot of it. A shot of whiskey prior to the meal is encouraged, like an offering to the gods and an act of submission. and the laughter, amazement, and groans of pleasure with each course is a part of the pied de cochon experience, just about the best part of this restaurant, and the reason why it was worth every single solitary calorie.so onto the food. we began our journey with an order of the foie gras cromesquis: three cubes of the most delicious liquid foie you've ever known. piping hot when they arrive at the table, the waiter warned that we should wait two minutes prior to consumption and consume in one big bite. my bite was ecstasy- breaking into the outer fried crust gave way to straight up hot liquid pleasure. If you don't start out with this appetizer, you'll deeply regret it. other dishes following this bite were also wonderful, although the star of the other three we ordered was the guinea hen liver mousse. a creamy fuschia-toned concoction arrives at the table, neatly packed in a small jar, and sealed with a layer of fat. pickled onions and a sweet shot glass of jelly are meant to top your spread of liver on crisped baguette slices. it was a perfect little appetizer to share, right down to the last bite. the piglet roast, thin slices of loin topped with a luscious sauce of confit of tuna mixed into mayonnaise, was excellent, as were the slices of tangy, tender pickled tongue with spicy mustard. and so after a couple bathroom breaks (note the strategically placed tv in the restroom: so thoughtful) and a little more wine, arrived the entrees. the best of the three we ordered? the duck in the can. i don't need to wax poetic on how a savory mess out of a can can be so remarkably delicious. the perfectly cooked, medium rare duck breast combined with a generous slice of foie, and an unsuspectingly delicious concoction of cooked shredded cabbage was memorable to say the least. its arrival at the table is an event, and that first bite of duck, foie, cabbage, and a bit of the toast and puree below is one of those euphoric events that is never forgotten, and sought after for the rest of your culinary expeditions. our other excellent entrees included the foie gras duo, and the boudin and foie gras tart. the foie gras duo includes both the foie gras poutine and the foie gras burger. the poutine was wonderful, comfort food elevated to ridiculousness. that creamy foie gras rich gravy is unforgettable. the burger is the obscene part. sloppy, difficult to consume, but you will try! oh how you will try! after consuming a quarter of the burger, i recall my dining companions desperately trying to pick at pieces of lettuce, desperate for vegetables after the onslaught of fatty tummy saturation...whatever that means. the boudin tart was also good, though i think it was the redheaded step child of the group of entrees. still great, but overshadowed by the other two, and maybe a little heavy on the mustard. but i do love anything with boudin... i'd put it on my ice cream if i didn't gross people out so much.keeling over from happiness, we felt obligated to order one dessert, and opted for their maple syrup hot pot cake. i honestly can't remember what the hell this was called. but i do know that it was sugary, warm, melt in your mouth wonderful. just ask for a dessert that would fit that description. i assure you that the wait staff, perhaps the most amiable i've ever encountered, will be happy to oblige.my goodness, i can't say enough. i, like you, have had a lot of bad meals in my life, lots of hype followed by some sunken-shoulder disappointment. this was not one of those meals. did it exceed my expectations? nope. i expected heaven, and i got it. to recap, make sure you order the foie gras comesquis, the guinea hen liver mousse, the duck in the can, and the maple syrup hot pot thing. ask lots of questions, and just enjoy yourself. and pass out afterwards with happy thoughts of ducks and pigs that died for a good cause. i love this restaurant."

It is just the cuisine style that I was not up to. Place is very cute, located on the petite rue Duluth, which is a nice little side street, with cobblestones, and trees.Today was sunny, and the front was open to the sidewalk, so it was quite lovely. As were the adorable waiter, did not mind them at all. The service was great, when I got in right before 6pm (my reservation was at 6, but the seated me a good 15 minutes early!) The service DID slow down, though, around 6:30 as the place filled up. But there were still plenty of servers to take care of everyone.The food was exceptional. I had a green salad, Au Pied's house beer, and the Foi Gras Poutine. Now, the Poutine, I will admit, was too much for me. Having never had foi gras, or poutine, it was a challenge that really took it out of me. That being said, the foi gras had a good crisp outer layer, the cheese curds were very large, the gravy well flavoured, and the fries were extremely good. I think these may be the best fries I have had. I would go back just for them, they have an excellent flavour, crisp texture, and a deep brown colour. Even the green salad was good. The vinaigrette was very peppery, and had a good over all balance. The greens were varied, and included lots of yummy chutes, and stems as well as leaves. The bread was excellent, goo soft center and hard crust. I was impressed through and through.If you are not afraid to try honest Quebecois food, this is the place."

We were stuck in traffic and were half and hour late. I called them several times and they never answered but left a message. (Just reserving for this place is not easy. They never answer and they call you back to let you know if they have place a few days later) anyway, when we got to the restaurant they had given up our spot. After telling them it was birthday they managed to squeeze us in a spot after waiting another half an hour. The ambiance had a sugar shack feel. Including sitting very close to others. There is not much room in between tables. My husband had the foie gras poutine and I had the duck carpaccio. They were both great but he said his was very rich. I loved my plate as it was light. I also tried the bite sized foie which was wonderful. I then ordered a stew with porc and potatoe gratin on top. He has the ""meat plate"" to be honest both were too heavy. The food is prepared well but leaving here you almost fall into a food coma right away. In my opinion overhyped and pricey. I will not be going back."
/user_details?userid=fTqOoklob1_5Z5PzM6ZktA,Trish L.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"I went this restaurant twice during my recent visit to Montreal because I had previewed their menu online and there were so many choices that there was no way we would be able to experience it all.  A good portion of their menu contains foie gras (of which they are very famous for) but they also have a lot of fresh seafood. On the first visit, we had the bison tartare and foie gras cromesquis(which is a deep-fried breaded foie gras ball, similar concept to deep fried mozza sticks). The cromesquis were absolutely divine!  My friend ordered the french onion soup. It was very rich and had a strong wine flavour. For entrees, my friend had the infamous ""Duck in a Can"". She loved it while I thought it wasn't really my style. It was very heavy and rich. She loved the flavours. I would recommend it to someone who likes stew-like dishes. The foie gras that was in this dish was a little to overwhelming for me. Again, this is a personal taste thing. I ordered the lobster-roll with foie gras on top. This dish was fabulous! The lobster-roll was on-par with some of the best ones I've had in Maine. The bread was toasted perfectly. The slices of foie gras on top made it even more decadent. The lobster had a perfect texture and were in large chunks.On the second visit, my friend and I shared their dinner special which was arctic char for two with a pesto on top and served with deep-fried polenta sticks. The fish was cooked to perfection. I was really surprised that we were served the whole fish on a giant platter and this entree was only $50. Usually when I order an arctic char entree at other restaurants, I would only get a small section of the fish and the entree would already by around $25.  The service on both visits was excellent. I couldn't have asked for better. The servers were very patient and very good at explaining the menu. Definitely a very memorable experience and a must-try (at least once) in Montreal. If you've never had foie gras before, this is the place to experience it. They don't skimp on the foie gras portions and you really get to truly experience the taste of foie gras."

/user_details?userid=2CZ7gmzNDNk3FsexE1_1ZQ,Laura P.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Over Labor Day weekend I was in Montreal visiting a friend who insisted if I wanted to taste the best the city has to offer we needed to eat at Au Pied de Cochon. After making reservations nearly two months in advance, last Saturday night we went for dinner.  The restaurant is sparsely decorated with hardwood floors, plain tables, and an open kitchen.  It is clear that the main focus at Au Pied is not the decor, but the food.For starters we enjoyed the Foie Gras Cromesquis.  These tasty fried cubes of liquefied foie gras explode in your mouth the instant they are bitten into releasing way more flavor than can be imagined.  Next my friend and I both chose the Bison Tartare as an appetizer.  Served in the bowl it was prepared in, the bison meat is mixed with onions and a minimal amount of spices and comes with half a quail egg for the dinner to mix into the meat.  The preparation is simple, but it really allows all the flavor to come out.  For an entree my friend insisted I try the Duck in a Can.  At first this sounded odd, but after our server explained the preparation I was sold.  The meal includes a large portion of foie gras, duck meat, as well as a good helping of duck fat.  Since the meal is stored in the can before it is served, all the flavors melt together into one incredibly rich dish.  For dessert, we shared a blueberry pie for two.  The crust was layered with an almond paste, fresh Canadian blueberries, and topped with a thin layer of crème brûlée.  With all these ingredients I assumed the dessert would be heavy, but it was surprisingly airy without losing any of the flavor.One of the best parts of the experience was our server.  He answered any and all of our questions, and we could tell he was excited and passionate about the food.Overall, I'd have to say that my meal at Au Pied de Cochon was one of the best meals I've had in a long while."

Been there 3 times and I try to go every 9-12 mths because it is indeed, really rich. The biggest and most important thing before going there is to HAVE A RESERVATION! No way you can get there and not wait at least 1-2 hours before you can get a place. Even with reservation it's still long. Last time I went, i waited 30-40 minutes and enjoyed a free drink, so no rush, enjoy the free drink and wait because it's worth it. The service is impeccable. Relax and professional the staff is experienced and knows their stuff. The last time I went there, the waiter was kind enough to have an half portion in Entrées of Poutine au Foie Gras saving us money and letting us enjoying the plate.Also the wine we ordered was missing and the waited came back with 2 choices within the same price so no scam on trying to sell you the really expensive winne.  Also offer an improvised menu not on the menu; Côte de Boeuf croustillant avec sauce aux fruit sauvages. English: Crispy Beef Ribs with a wild fruits sauce (which was actually a réduction of beef fond with some chicoutai and wild fruits. Really Good! One must as an Entrée is the PDC Crusty salade: Salade aux Croustillant PDC. One weird but excellent thing (as well as the cheapest on the menu main course) the Fish N Chip served the old fashioned way. Cooked in Duck fat (like everything there) the «crispyness» of the fish N chip was amazingly good. I'd suggest everyone with place to try a Crème Brûlée which is obsviously made with real vanilla and therefore really tasty. The Chocolat Mousse also!! Be cautious on one thing: The Entrée (some of them at the very least) for someone with a small apetite can be considerate as large."

We were seated by the door which was definitely not the best spot in the house and having a reservation for over two weeks in advance I would have thought we would have had better seating arrangements. The wait staff was very professional the waiter took time to explain the very interesting menu and assisted us in picking a nice french Pinot Noir. We started with what the locals said was one of the chefs best dishes, the pomme frites cooked in duck fat with curds and gravy topped with foie gras. It was delicious to say the least. The GF had the roasted pork and I opted for the Bison Ribs. Both were excellent choices the pork was tender and juicy and the Bison Ribs were coated in a wonderful sauce that had a slight ginger flavor to it.  We finished with the house specialty for dessert which is a small cake surrounded by local maple syrup MMM, MMM, MMM! It was very interesting almost like having delicious pancakes smothered in maple syrup.  It left us both with wonderful smiles on our faces.Other than the poor seating we had the meal and service were very good and I would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Montreal!"

The Boy had taken me to Mont Tremblant for a skiing trip for my belated Graduation present and Christmas present. On our trip, we stayed in Montreal our first night across the border. I had read many times over on websites that this place was the place to go for great Canadian-French cuisine so I thought this was the perfect place to try my first authentic French meal. Boy, they were not lying! I'll admit I did not know really anything about French food prior to this trip so I asked the waitress for her recommendations which she gladly gave in her thick French accent. We started off with the cromesquis with foie gras appetizer which is basically this tiny pastry thingy filled with hot, liquid foie gras that explodes in your mouth. It exploded so well that I think some of it came out of my boyfriends mouth, oh! We also ordered an appetizer of marinated smoked sausages that Boy just had to try. Next, for our main course we split the infamous ""Duck in a Can"" entree as well as the Beef tartar with a side of fries cooked in duck fat! The tartar was great but the duck was PHENOMENAL. Even though I am pretty sure I contributed heavily to my LDL count in this one meal, I must say that it is one of the most delicious and mind blowing food experiences I've ever had! It has opened me up to the world of French cuisine! I can't wait to eat here again when I come back for another skiing trip. It was my favorite meal the entire time I was in Canada. If you're ever in Montreal, do not miss the opportunity to have a food revelation like I did at this neighborhood gem!"

For me it just seemed too much goodness that day (i wasn't feeling it). he thought 'duck in a can' sounded ""gross"", so he ordered something else.I had the Plogue a Champlain, which are little buckwheat pancakes topped with potatoes, cheese,  bacon, maple syrup & foie gras.  The maple syrup with the richness of the foie gras worked BEAUTIFULLY - i had no regrets about this dish.

If you've not been here before, they basically take duck, stuffed in the same can container with foie gras, cabbage, some broth and glaze (see other reviewers for complete description). They seal and then pressure cook the can when order, and then bring it to the table and open the can steaming right in front of you! Besides the entertainment value, the duck and foie gras tasts so rich... REAL rich, not Donald Trump-rich. it's truly decadent, fatty and buttery, and not for the faint of heart.

Moaning and bemoaning this elusive ""Duck in a Can"", my friend swore another trip back to Montreal was in his cards to attain this perfection of duck and foie.it's his Achilles's heel, for every so often, i take a jab and know this scar, this unattained perfection, will invoke that jealous lover's quiet rage and soft sadness, and hopefully will provoke him a step closer to booking his next visit to beautiful Montreal."

/user_details?userid=ON3q49XvvnV3Vql4Mb0riQ,Dave K.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"Went here on a Thursday night on a summer night. Fantastic to be in Montreal (I grew up here) during this time of year when everyone's out enjoying the evenings and nightlife that Montreal has to offer. Was clued into this restaurant by my brother, who still lives here, so decided to give it a try with my SO. I'm a big poutine lover so when I heard about the Foie Gras poutine dish they served as a starter here, hell, if you're a foodie you should be able to appreciate and love Foie Gras. And it being poutine, hey, why not? When it came to the table, I was underwhelmed. It was just a plate of poutine with a piece of Foie Gras laid on top of it. There was no originality to it other than the fact that the head chef must have thought it would be cool just to lay a piece of duck liver on top of a dish of poutine just for kicks, charge an arm and a finger for it and reap the rewards of all Montrealers & Quebecois that enjoy the artery-choking, gut-busting nature of poutine, and add some delicacy on top of it for good measure. Taste was good but otherwise, the Foie Gras itself was not done in a typical French way that actually preserves and brings out the nature, flavor and richness of the Foie Gras itself.Next was Duck-in-a-Can and the PDC Melting Pot. My SO and I have stomachs the size of...a can, not a beer barrel. The servings of both of these were for very healthy (and hearty) appetites so you definitely get what you pay for here. The Duck-in-a-Can is served, literally, from a can that's opened up in front of you with a can opener, and served on top of a piece of toast and puree. You could see the oil from the duck fat just drip out of that can too (the serving piece is the duck breast with the skin on it). This is realllllly rich food and not to be messed with if you have gastrointestinal problems. Bring your Pepto-Bismal with you if you're faint of heart for these kinds of foods! The taste? Pretty darn good but a little convoluted and mixed up with all the other ingredients mixed into the can. It can be compared with ""Mom's pile of mess baked in the oven"".The PDC Melting Pot had a bunch of stuff in a little clay pot (similar to a little Le Creuset pot). It was filled with stewed pork, seaweed wrapped blood sausage, pork sausage, mashed potatoes and shallots (could have been something else). It was, again, a mish-mash of stuff put together as an experiment but it definitely didn't highlight any individual ingredient particularly well. Again, there seemed to have been no imagination put into this as it felt like someone just decided to shove a bunch of varieties of meat in there, throw some mash in for a base and broil it up for a sure fire, artery-choking experience. (You get the theme of this restaurant now.)Nothing about these dishes were ""bland"" at all. But nothing about these dishes also spoke to the uniqueness of why PDC is sooooo popular. I think the roasted pig's head and leg of pig should have been selected. My 3 star rating is for the promise of the other entrees that we should have selected and the hint of madness in the head chef's experimentations. I grew up in Montreal but I didn't remember ever having been knocked over the head with anything so rich and heavy as PDC."

And waited. Finally we asked the head waitress about it, who spoke to the waitress who'd cleared our tables. Turned out that she had thrown it away! The manager offered free desserts, but we were both stuffed and the dish was $37 and barely eaten. So he took it off the bill. What little I ate was very delicous and fatty. Some staff are excellent (manager and head waitress who was able to rattle off the HUGE list of specials for the day without looking at anything) where as others are totally hopeless, such as our waitress, who I don't think could speak English.

Apps were were good (nothing special).It's the mains that killed me. On a good note the food portions are massive for what you pay. And very filling. So please only stick to 1 main dish if it's for yourself. That may even be enough for 2. I respect this.The thing that killed me was the way they food was prepared. I ordered the pied de cochon, and while the inside was nice and tender, the outside was dry and crispy. Nearly uneatable. The boudin was very dry as hell, and it could have used a little more of that sweet cabbage/Onion(?) to cut it a little. We had other things on the menu that were also so so.Honestly come here, but I wouldn't spend money to purposely go to Montreal just to eat here. This is the only place Ive been to in which I might return to (just to try the foie items) even though I had such a bad experience (foodwise)"

This is what we found here. It is true, the food is good, well-executed, and original. A failed lobster ""sundae"" notwithstanding we found all the dishes to be exactly what we expected. The problem was the service; it was a mess. Even after waiting an hour to be seated for our reservation (which is totally unacceptable) we were in the mood to forgive. Unfortunately the wait continued for another 30 minutes while the staff stumbled to properly set our table, take our order, and bring out our first course. By this time it wouldn't have mattered if Martin Picard himself was preparing our meal tableside, we were tired and hungry and no longer in the mood for the bungling service. Moreover, other botched details of the service, too numerous to mention, indicated lazy management and poorly trained staff (at one point I had 3 forks!). Overall, we just didn't have a good time and felt like we had wasted our time and money and there is no excuse for that."

/user_details?userid=hFZeAU6xluP8REPuJfV4bg,Shiran M.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Martin Picard is a charlatan. Just because you can add foie gras to every dish, doesn't mean you have to. Serving great materials in a can like the ""duck in a can"" is a bad joke. It looks awful and the idea of cooking sourkrat with foie gras is just sad for the  poor goose that had to give its liver for this disgrace. I'm not impressed by a waiter that tells me about the blue fin tuna they got today and then serves it with spicy mayonnaise. I can't understand a place that serves a wine glass from an open bottle that is too cold and rotten (the waiter said it's disgusting!). How can an open bottle be rotten?! It means that either they served it to other people or that it's been lying in the fridge for a few days open. Both options are bad. There were two dishes that i liked and in both the theme was ""keep it simple"" (bison tangue and braised beef with mashed potatoes). If you have good taste, don't come near this overly trying to be cool and laid back restaurant. Just go eat poutine on saint dennis. It will be almost the same and cheapest."

But frankly, I didn't have that experience. I came as a walk-in and sat at the bar. The place has a raucous, fun vibe, but after a while it's a bit much. Food is maple shack-cuisine gone high-end. Foie gras is everywhere. Entree I was steered to was waaaay over the top -- with foie gras, maple syrup, potatoes, bacon, cheese and probably 12 other ingredients. (Basically, you lost the thread of what they were trying to do). Appetizer was...okay. A fussy terrine of sorts that wedded a pate de foie gras (at least that's what I think it was) with a boudin (black sausage) in a checkerboard pattern -- it looked and tasted alright, but was ridiculously overpriced at about 25 Canadian dollars. Dessert may have been the best thing -- a nice, decadent maple pudding. I saw some dishes coming out of the kitchen that looked better, but I went with what waitress suggested. Oh, and speaking of waitress, she was mostly non-existent -- food took forever to come out and it was hard to flag anyone down (a guy pouring water shrugged at me and said, ""I'm just a water boy."") Again, that's fine if you're talking a greasy spoon, but it's pretty hard to get out of here for less than 75 Canadian dollars (with drinks) -- I spent over 100. Even more puzzling: Manager saw I was waiting on food and didn't do much to step in... though I think his pour of a free glass of Calvados was an attempt to rectify things a bit. Again, I suspect you can have a great meal here, though I'm still not sure the service will ever be right. No one seemed to be getting there food in a timely manner."

Main course: duck in a can, terrific, still don't understand how they make this dish and keep it warm serving at the table. The special that day they had a whole rabbit, that i shared with my daughter, very good. For desert we enjoyed chocolate pot and a pear with ice cream.

""can i get you girls another glass of wine?""The clincher was that we waited literally 20 minutes for the duck to be cleared, and the    45 MINUTES    for the dessert menu.  I guess I should have just asked the server for another shoulder rub to pass the time.  We finally got delivered the dessert menu, with another shoulder rub, a wink, and practically cheek to cheek worthless description of the maple syrup pie.Then I waited another 30 minutes for him to clear the dessert, as he was busy rubbing all the other diners shoulders too.  Then I waited another   30 MINUTES to get the check.  For a restaurant in that class, the service was pathetic and annoying.  And waiting for service while my stomach churned through the most excessively rich dish I have had in my life didn't help my impression.  If the bill was whacked in half, I'd say I got what I paid for.  But all I got from Au Pied de Cochon was a huge let-down on what I thought was supposed to be an exceptionally excellent dining experience.  After a 3 hour crap-dining experience, I was exhausted and disappointed, and didn't feel like going to Barmacie a martini bar, that I promise will not disappoint."

I never write about service for a restaurant but I must say that drunk idiots being stupid with the waitresses can normally end poorly but surprisingly this situation was handled with a very graceful manner. Now the food... Pork Rinds were amazing. Well seasoned and nice and toasty. Tomato Tart not my favorite(mustard flavor was over powering). Foie Gras Poutine - probably the highlight of the night! Dude, Foie Gras of the best quality, seared to perfection, on top of well cooked fries with cheese curd and a gravy that would taste good on a shoe. The gravy had an earthy quality that leads me to believe something other than regular beef base was in it, in a good way. Duck in a Can was what the food prior would lead you to think. It was amazing. The perfect blend of seasonings and herbs with a good mix of stewed vegetables. The duck was definitely fatty considering it is canned with a layer of fat over the duck breast and a considerable slab of foie gras but that only adds to the tenderness of the meat. served atop ... who cares the duck was outstandingly cooked and seasoned. Lamb shank was exceptionally prepared, not the most memorable choice but definitely good. Dessert did not disappoint either. Pudding Choemer or whatever they call it. It's the maple sauce with a biscuit in it. A MUST HAVE!All in all it was an excellent experience. The beer was great and the wine selection was very nice as well. I still can't get over how nicely the waitresses handled these clowns who were wasted. The price wasn't bad at all about $100 per person including tax and tip which included 3 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 3 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts plus a coffee and a cappucino.

The portion was just right for 2 of us to share and feel satisfied without the greasy feeling. Finally, we had the PDC (pied de cochon) to share. We did not order the one which is stuffed with foie gras as that would be FG-OD. This dish was huge! The pork knuckle was exactly how I liked it to be... so soft and tender the meat is falling off the bone.. and the sauce which comes with it was sooo good. It comes with a side of mashed potato with cheese whipped in it. We left VERY happy and I wished I can come back here everyday to try EVERYTHING on the menu..."

Definitely too much food for the 2 of us, but it was hard not to want to order everything on the menu. Good to know: - for reservations, call the restaurant and leave a message with your reservation information; they will then call you back to confirm so plan ahead.

Their Bison tongue was also very very good.For entrees, we ordered Duck in a Can and Catch of the Day(halibut). The duck dish had a rich combination of Foie Gras, duck meat(with skin), vegetable and their tasty sauce. Everything was put in a sealed can and cooked in the oven. The duck meat was cooked rare, which was perfect. But for me, the skin was undercooked, it didn't taste good with all the half-cooked fat on it. I wish they had seared the skin and cooked down the fat before putting it into the can. The halibut was good, the meat was tender and the tasted great with the sauce.

However, the quality of the meal was overshadowed by the unacceptable treatment we received. My girlfriend and I visited Montreal for a long weekend, and Au Pied de Cochon was intended to be our one real treat to ourselves. We're law students, and don't have a lot of money. We really enjoyed the meal - the food is impeccable, the atmosphere is fantastic, and while there, the staff was exceptional. But we both woke up in the middle of the night after that meal violently ill, and spent hours suffering through some awful food poisoning before we could finally get some rest. There's no doubt that we were food poisoned from something we ate at Au Pied de Cochon - neither of us had had any other food, asides from some crackers, for hours before the meal, and we felt perfectly fine going into the restaurant. The next day, we figured out that we had shared two items on the menu. I wrote a very polite email to the restaurant, letting them know how much we enjoyed the meal, how much we had looked forward to it, how we had budgeted our trip around being able to enjoy one truly wonderful meal, and how it was really quite clear that something at their restaurant (either cured ham or a molten chocolate cake) had made both of us very, very ill. I told the restaurant that I'd really appreciate whatever they could do for us. Their reply was, to say the least, heartless. Nothing even close to any acknowledgment of fault or responsibility on their part, let alone an apology. Instead, they said they hoped to see us again when we were next in Montreal. A simple, 'we are sorry', would have sufficed. Excellent food? No doubt. Great ambience? Absolutely. Ability to do the right thing? Not at all. Montreal has a lot of great places to eat. I hope that people read this and choose to go elsewhere. This was a truly terrible experience."

The house beer and ciders went well with a greasy meal. From where I sat, it looked like they made most of their food with the wood burning oven which was a sight to see.

I seriously love the concept and it deserves all the hype it receives, 5 stars for creativity! But the main favourites like the poutine, Dn'C etc... my god... zero regard for flavour balance. So go ahead, bring it on APdC lovers, but if you have half a tasting palette in your mouth, you will O.D. on salt and creamy, fatty richness. Many people love it. So the novelty is cute and foie-gras vampires who are legally deprived of foie gras in NYC will flock to APdC (as would I), but I don't buy into this as a Montréalais.

If this food came-off of a foodtruck for 18$ or less per plate... ahh... then 4 stars. Otherwise I believe this funky concept is misplaced as a restaurant. This kind of sinful, sloppy food belongs in styrofoam packaging, not fine glass plates... if you get my drift."

It can be problematic to visit a place like Au Pied de Cochon that is so heavily hyped and known by foodies. How can any meal live up to the expectations? Our meal was solid with some delights and slight disappointments.We booked four weeks out. Arriving on foot, we walked right by the place, as there is no sign (I like that).  We arrived at our appointed hour, but had to wait another half hour. For part of the wait, we were given a seat at the counter with a direct view of the controlled chaos of the open kitchen. The brigade was dressed in dark blue Dickies workshirts with name patches like one find at a garage. They were working feverishly. I noted the fry station seemed to be holding items longer than is best for freshness, something we would experience firsthand. While quaffing a local beer (St. Ambroise Pale Ale) we watched the different dishes coming out of the kitchen and started to formulate a plan.Once at the table, we decided to order more items but split them. We ordered the famed poutine with foie gras, a tomato tart, fried zucchini blossoms (with the small zucchini attached), the PDC's melting pot. Half of the dishes were okay and half were excellent. The poutine was luke-warm, had just a few fries and the foie gras was not of the highest grade, having a fairly coarse texture. The blossoms were thickly battered, not the tempura batter that we had expected. They were also pretty greasy. The tomato tart was fresh and perfectly crafted: a good counterpoint to heavy food. The PDC's melting pot was the star with four kinds of pork plus roasted mushrooms and onions on a bed of mashed potatoes, which ended up being aligot: Auvergne style (cheese enriched) mashed potatoes all in a cocotte. Our favorite cut was the pork belly, but all were exemplary and we enjoyed the variety. Several tables had the pig's head for two, which I am sure was tasty, but my wife was not really up for the visuals for us to order it.A table of four sat near us, which provided considerable humor. Two couples of asian gangstas talked up a storm of stupidity. The guys tried to impress the women who were preoccupied with playing video games on their phones. They ordered a bottle of wine which they promptly sent back stating it was ""sour"" (not big fans of acidity, I guess, which might have helped them enjoy their heavy meal). Behind them, a Japanese couple spent the entire time fiddling with their iPhones while eating: never talking with each other.We ordered poached pear with vanilla ice cream and a cappuccino. The poached dessert was perfection, but the cappuccino was nasty. Super darkly roasted espresso, no steamed milk and a cap of fluffy dry foam.In summary, it was a good meal with ups and downs. It was not the finest pork dish nor the best foie gras I have ever tasted, but it may have been an off night. To their great credit, the prices are shockingly reasonable. Given the crushing popularity, they could charge twice as much and still pack them in."

The food is so amazingly rich with outstanding flavor. I have never quite had anything like this cusine before. We enjoyed Tomatoe Tartlet and beef tartare for our appetizer. I enjoyed the Nova Scotia swordfish with artichoke hearts. Ramzi enjoyed the foie gras poutine. Poutine is a dish consisting of french fries, cheese curds, brown gravy, and topped with other ingredients. In Ramzi's case, he chose to top the poutine with Foir Gras. The restaurant has a bustling feel but still quaint enough to feel relaxed. Service took a bit long, but the service staff still very friendly."

We went to this bar to eat foie gras. We were a party of 5. After we been seated, and the bus boy poured us the tap water. Were were left for almost 15 minutes. Then the waiter came and asked if we would like to order a Starter. He suggested the daily special of salads. Given their prices we expected quality and quantity. Come one, a small dish of tomato with sauce for $12? We ordered Foie Gras Cromesquis for $3.5. No one on the table including who swallowed the two pieces know how it tastes. We ordered Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart, Duck in a Can, Bison Rib, and PDC's Melting Pot. This is a one greasy choice of dishes. None of us manage to finish her/his plate. So if you have a family history of heart attacks, obesity, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, avoid this restaurant.  We noticed that most clientele were hip-hop-styled.

However, there are a few tasty salad options (and a catch of the day -  no, not me!) for those who don't get excited about tucking into a plate of pork, beef, poultry, bison, deer or foie gras ""fat liver""! The atmosphere is busy, but cosy and a lil romantic. The problem is that because it is so busy and popular, the food comes out a snails pace. My friends and I waited an hour for our appetizers and another hour for our meals. If you're in great company (and you have a bottle of wine on the go), the wait time isn't all that annoying or noticeable, but I'd advise not to go on an empty stomach, unless of course you want to fill up on foie gras poutine.

I looked it up on Youtube and went nuts watching Anthony Bourdain eating there.I was so pumped I did a few Internet searches and read reviews, including Yelp's, to get an idea of what to expect and to order dishes I knew I'd like. And I'm glad I did my homework.The foie gras cromenisques just... melted. Literally. 2 or 3 seconds and you forget it was fried. Delight, in pure form. The tarragon bison tongue was quite soft, and the flavors were very rich. Then, the foie gras poutine. Please note: I am not someone who likes fries and rarely eat them, but I couldn't pass this up... I never imagined fries w/ gravy, cheese, and yes, foie gras could be so decadently good.Up to now, great. A confluence of amazing flavors, all very rich.Then, the duck in a can. My only disappointment in what was probably the most unique and creative dish I've ever eaten was that it was not as large as I thought it'd be. A few reviews said it was a very large portion, but at nearly 6' tall I wasn't too impressed w/ the size. My friend, in contrast, ordered the pied de cochon which I must say wasn't the best dish. The onions were fine, but they were too rich, and he did at least finish the pork. He was fuller than I was; otherwise, I would've ordered the cured foir gras & boudin tart as I'm a huge lover of boudin/blood sausage.This was so worth it... such a cool restaurant with very unique food.

/user_details?userid=3WinVzxrRpbNIyRsz59l8A,Bund W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We were in town for a party this weekend and Au Pied de Cochon was highly recommended by a friend of ours.  We arrived just in time for opening hours. And the restaurant was full within 10 minutes.  There was a buzz of activity.  The restaurant itself has a clean, rustic lodge look and feel.  Warm colors throughout.  The kitchen area is exposed and is buzzing with staff.  We walked in to the aroma of baking bread and what I believe to be hickory chips smoking in the wood burning oven.  For those of you not fluent in French, the staff speak excellent English and switched over instantly to it once they realized which language was going to be more ""comfortable"" for us. I myself can understand and read French but I am severely out of my element in conversing in it.  My kudos to the waiters and busboys for accommodating us so easily.  I will also add the staff were very friendly, attentive and professional.   There is nothing pretentious about this restaurant.  It delivers on the quality of their food.  The pricing is very reasonable given the ingredients used and the portions.Now. On to the food.We were told that this is the place for foie gras in Montreal.  And while I do not have it that often, this place change my mind about it.  There were six of us so we ordered five foie gras appetiziers to set the tone.  Amongst our choices.  The FG poutine, cranberry FG, balsamic reduction FG and their special FG appetizer on a buckwheat pancake, potatoes, maple syrup and a big of egg yolk.  While we gorged on the appetizers, time passed to allow our mains to be cooked.  We shared a veal shank, which was good for 3-4 people. It took about 45 mins to cook but the wait was barely noticed due to everyone dipping bread into the various foie gras sauces left over from the appetizers.  Two others shared duck in a can and one person had a French Onion soup that smelled great.  The veal rack was loaded with veggies as well so it was a balanced meal.  There was some left over due to the size.  We did manage to consume about 90% of it.  After that, we had no room for the desserts, which were tempting.  To conclude, this is a fabulous restaurant.  I really appreciate the focus on the food and the service.  The dishes here are quite unique.  Feeling adventurous? In the mood for some seared veal heart or Pig's Head for two?  This is your place.  If those dishes don't appeal to you, there is some standard far as well, such as pork chops, ducks and fish.  As much as I love the cuisine of my home city (Toronto) I am saddened that it does not have a restaurant of this calibre.  At least, none that I am aware of.  I admire Montreal's gastro scene.  This is a shining example of it."

After a day of hoofing it around the city, we walked right past this place twice since it doesn't have a sign. However, upon calling them for help we found it right there in plain sight. We were seated promptly and then sat there forsaken and forlorn for about ten minutes, my pet peeve. The reason for this was apparently that there was just one waitress for the front seating area and she took all the time needed to explain dishes and answer questions for each table, hence the wait. (Some self-absorbed diners love to inordinately monopolize servers with their inane queries instead of using the internet.) Anyhow, if you did your five minutes of homework, you know to order: pork and foie gras. We started with the delicious fried zucchini blossoms and a simple salad, then on to the stuffed pig's foot with foie. It was awesome, and awesomely rich. My wife, who is near-vegetarian, threw herself with gusto into disassembling this earthy, collagen-laden treat, served atop mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables and a thick demi-gravy. Whatever magical treatment they did there was absolutely no stink of cochon associated with this trotter, only yummy goodness. Yes, we did finish it, but there was no room for dessert. We had a French red the details of which now escape me. The place is pretty loud and tightly packed. I wouldn't call it comfortable, more down-to-the-business-of-eating, a money mill.

The ""Au Pied de Cochon"" restaurant is famous throughout the Québec province (if you visit Montréal or live in Montréal, it would be an absolute shame not to come here at least once). Martin Picard's small restaurant is one of the very few restaurants that serves strictly gourmet Québécoise food. The restaurant's deserved reputation and celebrity comes by way of mouth as much as by the popular cooking show (en français, mais oui!) hosted by Martin Picard himself. Martin Picard is heralded by his legions of fans for successfully turning traditionally working class grub into world-class cuisine. The delightful fare includes venison, Poutine au foie gras, canard en conserve (incredible!!!) and (my favorite) pouding chômeur. At the end of the meal we both wondered aloud if there was nary a duck anywhere in the world who still possessed his liver as only our imported French wine and desserts did not boast a bit of foie gras. But don't confuse our observation with a complaint as we would not want it any other way! Surprisingly the ambiance is quite romantic despite the noisy and crowded atmosphere. By all means, go(!!!)... and don't forget to make a reservation and most importantly, bring a defibrillator and fast like Mahatma Gandhi before your arrival. Bon appétit!"

I was THAT impressed with the restaurant! Perfect from start to finish. One of the owners took our drink orders (not Martin Picard, unfortunately, but extremely nice) and the bread and butter was brought out shortly. Oh, that butter! Even their butter is amazing, obviously from a local, superior source, served with rustic bread. I can only think of one other restaurant (Eleven Madison Park in NYC) where bread and butter were so memorable. We ordered foie gras cromesquis and tomato tartlets for appetizer, both were amazing. Especially cromesquis, I'd never had anything like that in my life -- that feeling of warm, intense foie gras flavor exploding in your mouth! Had boudin and foie gras tart and the famous Duck in a Can for entree, again both were AMAZING. Both dishes had SO much foie gras in/on it! Every bite was simply heavenly. Sorry to use such cheesy language, but I have no better way to express it. That Duck in a Can had so many flavors melding together that it was dizzying! And that boudin and foie gras tart with BIG chunks of each strewn all over... it's enough to give me an orgasm now. Even the dessert was amazing (I know, if I say ""amazing"" one more time in this review...) We ordered pudding chomeur, which arrived boiling and smelling intensely of maple syrup! It was sheer torture waiting for it to cool down, but when it did... so simple yet so freakin' delicious. I am SO making that for dessert this Christmas. Even though I begged the owner to open a franchise in New York, I'm glad there's nothing like that around here. Otherwise I would go there weekly and weigh 400 pounds! Seriously, one of the most amazing meals in my life and all that amazing food for around $150 for two. This is officially one of my favorite restaurants in the WORLD and I canNOT wait to go back!"

The price for the quality is second to none. I also love the look of the restaurant and  the service. Our waiter was well versed in the menu and had many recommendations for food and wine pairings. Whenever in Montreal I urge you to go to this resturant.
/user_details?userid=68dqd1RwsEoAi3uMo7_fsg,M B.,"Newark, NJ",4 star rating,"My fiance saw this on an episode of ""No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain"" and wanted to try it. He called the morning that we planned to eat there and managed to get a reservation for two for the bar. We were probably VERY lucky to even get that, because the place was packed, and there was a line out the door when we arrived. The hostess asked if we preferred a French or an English menu (English, please!) and quickly seated us. There was not a lot of room at the bar but it was not at all uncomfortable. Coats and purses can be hung on small hooks in front of your knees - very convenient since waiters and patrons are always running around in back of you, and since there is about four feet of space between the back of your bar chair and more dining tables. We were actually seated right by a kitchen/work area, so we saw a few appetizers being prepared. The staff was right there but we didn't seem to be in each others' way. He ordered the foie gras cromesquis for an appetizer ... we intended on sharing it, but were informed that it can only be eaten by one person, since you basically have to put the entire thing in your mouth and let it ""explode."" Since I was not too comfortable with the idea of foie gras in the first place, I didn't order one for myself ... he said it was creamy and delicious and was an excellent start to the meal. We also got a basket of very yummy bread, perhaps sourdough? He got a draft beer and I was fine with tap water (we were offered tap or mineral by the waiter). Our entrees came out quickly ... duck magret in mushroom sauce for him, and the ""happy pork chop"" (a large, thick pork chop cooked with mushrooms, onions and red cabbage) for me. Absolutely delicious. I wanted to pick up my bowl and lick it clean of the wonderful sauce. One minor annoyance was that I got a bit of bone in my very first bite and had to find a discreet way to dispose of it, which was not easy with my cloth napkin. We also got a paper cone of pommes frites, which we could not finish because we were stuffed from dinner. Parking was a GIANT bother. We literally circled the area for over an hour, and got very frustrated and almost canceled our reservation. There appears to be only Resident Parking available on the side streets (we weren't sure since we don't speak French and all the street signs were in French), and Rue Duluth is a very narrow street with limited parking only available on one side. There also did not appear to be any pay lots within walking distance. We finally found a metered spot on a perpendicular street, which actually turned out to be a fantastic spot because we were only about three buildings away from the restaurant. However, the pay meter was quite confusing (even with an English Translation button) and wouldn't take more than a $2 coin from us. Since it was 8:50 p.m., I had a theory that paid parking might expire at 9 p.m. ... fiance went to ask a woman in a chocolate shop next to Au Pied De Cochon about the parking rules, and she confirmed that we didn't have to pay for parking after 9 p.m.So since she helped us, I must also throw in praise for her chocolate shop. I forget the name, but we bought two pieces of chocolate to patronize her shop after her kind help. The chocolates weren't much bigger than the $2 coins that each of them cost, but they were quite good ... so if you want a little sweet after your meal, head here and get one. I had the caramel chocolate - very good, I'm wondering if it was a truffle. So - Au Pied De Cochon in a nutshell - delicious food, good service, call ahead in advance (lots of advance) for a table reservation, and look for parking SUPER early ... or better yet, just take a cab."

We watched a party of 7 be seated in front of us (assume they had a res, too). We were repeatedly lied to by the hostess. She even told us our table was about to free up because the folks eating there ""just paid their check."" Turns out no one was paying. She was lying to everyone there. We've eaten all over the world and never seen anything like this. Quite weird. We took our $ elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=e7k_wQY75A8fEeWol9NAtQ,sally w.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Note: I couldn't get reservations since the trip to montreal was last minute but I did ended up ordering takeout from here.After reading about all the rave reviews, I was excited to try this place out even though I couldn't get reservations. I figured takeout wouldn't be much of a difference and it probably wasn't. I ordered the poutine with foie gras as an appetizer before we head to another restaurant down the block. The taste itself was good but nothing special. I mean, you can't really go wrong with french fries right? The only addition was the gravy which was flavorful and the foie gras which had a weird texture to it...when you bite into one it almost bursts in your mouth in a weird, slightly undercooked way. Anyway, it was nothing special for $23. I gave this place 3 stars (if I could, it would be 2 1/2) because I wasn't going to give a place 4/5 stars if I never really ate there. If I were to return and have a full meal, I will surely reassess my review and scoring. Anyway, I also disliked the service in the front. There was a young lady who working as the maitre'd and she was just in a whole other world. We told her we wanted to do takeout and she said only certain items on the menu were available for that option. Fine. I asked her for recommendations and she said she was a vegetarian and left it at that. At least say ""but we're known for blah, blah, blah."" She just said she was a vegetarian and that was it. I had to fish for answers from her. She just seemed like she didn't care and gave an uptight attitude. I wanted to order the duck in a can for takeout but she said they won't heat it up for me and that I would have to boil my own water to heat it up. Mind you, I'm staying at a hotel so how the hell am I going to boil water for a meal? It's takeout...at least have the common courtesy to heat it up for your patrons. After waiting about 20 min for the poutine, we finally left that place. To my disappointment, she didn't even give us a fork. Doesn't takeout usually include utensils? I would have went back for it if we hadn't left. The experience was such a disappointment that it makes me not want to go back anymore."

My husband and I went there with a strong recommendation from our hotel concierge; he even got us a table last minute! Small cozy bistro with heavenly delicious food, not with fancy deco, but a sincere attitude toward the food. I admire them. The wine list is relatively short, but the guy who took our order (I think he is Phil) recommended a very good Burgundy to our poutine; It's not an expensive selection, but it was good match. Their service was also attentive; we never had to ask for something; their staff really took a good care of us! Excellent orchestrated piece!"
/user_details?userid=zJ2iry9lH6KuU8FZSMwhhQ,Nicole S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for Labor Day weekend.  We had actually decided on another spot for our ""big fancy"" dinner out but as it turns out, that restaurant was closed on Sunday nights.  As this place was also highly recommended to us, we trekked there.  Of course, halfway through the fifteen minute walk it starts torrentially pouring.  So when we arrived we're pretty sopping wet and just ready to have a drink (but still in good enough spirits).  The look on the hostess's face when we said we didn't have reservation was priceless: this was certainly not a place to just pop into.  She did take pity on us though, and when a reservation at the bar was late she let us take the spot.  The bartenders that waited on us were incredibly nice and helpful in our selections ---even going so far to suggest we cut down our orders since our appetizers and such were larger and heavier than we were expecting.  My boyfriend and I split the ever-famous duck in a can and it was just as amazing as the hype would lead you to believe.  Definitely easy to split between two people, and we still didn't finish it after splitting an appetizer and separate first courses.  (I'm a big fan of beef tartare and they have an amazing rendition of it) It is pricey but worth every dime.  Great neighborhood as well for walking around and shopping."

We all said that it might have been top 3 meal of all time. No one had anything slightly bad to say. We ordered like champions. We shared 4 appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 desserts. The Duck Carpaccio was IMPECCABLE! Duck in a can was an experience and it was well worth it. It is really a treat to dine at a restaurant like PDC."
/user_details?userid=C5RK6X_BY90EGWCLKTPy2g,Coren D.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,"We loved this place so much last year, so we planned another trip back just to go again. This time around, I ordered the Plogue a Champlain. What's a plogue? I had no idea, it's not a Celtic rock band, nor a disease spread by vermin, and the menu omits any description whatsoever. Turns out, it's Quebecois French slang, meaning ""plug,"" as in this dish could clog Lake Champlain. It consists of a pancake bottom layer, topped with potatoes, bacon, melted cheddar, and seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce. All of the richness just oozes and drips down, soaking into the pancake. Each bite was dense with delicious duck fat, bacon fat, and butter. Thankfully, the portion size was manageable, or else I would have had needed stat angioplasty in the dining room. I had it as my main course, but it could easily be shared as a starter for two. Now I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. One tip: even if you can't get a reservation, you may have a chance getting a table if there's a no show, or just opt to sit at the bar and watch the cooks at work in the open kitchen."
/user_details?userid=_Vd-dedw_r0TsxluUh5ogw,katie j.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"Dining highlight of our trip to Montreal, and one of the best dinners I've had in a very, very long time.  Au Pied de Cochon (or APDC as so many fondly term it) is truly amazing and a must-visit for any true foodie. Reservations are hard to come by, but I managed to snag a 9:30 pm Friday night reservation calling a few days before. Also, we were in the area and stopped by at 8:30 pm with low expectations of being seated early... but the host graciously sat us within 10 minutes! Great start to a great evening.The restaurant is lively and bustling, and actually quite a bit more casual than I anticipated. Lovely to have fantastic food without a stuffy ambiance. It's a wonderfully cheery place, warmed by the alluring smell of French cooking wafting throughout the restaurant. Waiters were friendly and eager to give recommendations.The Foodnalysis:- Foie Gras Cromesquis - Absolutely delicious. These truffle-sized treats are eaten in one bite. The fried, crispy exterior gives way to a savory burst of liquid... really amazing and unique.- Bison Tongue - Tender, delicious.  Don't let the word 'tongue' scare you off from this fantastic appetizer.- Duck in a Can - Flavorful, filling, fatty, fantastic... and many other ""f"" adjectives. Their signature dish, the Duck in a Can, is a breast and foie gras paired and hosts of other great tasting items sealed in a can then boiled to perfection. The waiter literally brings out a can and opens it, pouring out the rich, steaming contents before your very eyes. It's great and unique, definitely a must-try. - Foie Gras Poutine - As an American (and an Asian one at that), poutine is not something my taste buds are accustomed to. But Foie Gras Poutine was my best attempt at being French Canadian during this meal! Very rich, and a little much considering I shared some of the Duck in a Can.- Oven Baked Apple - Sweet, but not overly sugarly. Baked just the right amount of time to achieve that perfect, soft texture.  A nice end to a rich meal.The Bottom Line:The perfect Montreal dinner spot with amazing food. Make an early reservation and try the Foie Gras Comesquis, Bison Tongue and Duck in a Can for a truly unique dining experience!"

/user_details?userid=bhhCfgvSPMtnGoNORUC0pg,Brendan D.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",5 star rating,"Dear Myles P,It is obvious that you have no clue how restaurants operate. While I understand being pissed that you were left standing in the rain, that would irk me as well. What I cant stand is customers like you who assume just because you see empty tables that you are entitled to one. Let me explain how a reservation system works... Most busy restaurants seat an earling seating and a late seating. For my restaurant we take reservations from 6:00 to 7:00 and then again from 8:30 to 9:15. The restaurant then does its best to spread those early reservations evenly across those early seating times... 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00. Now, you might decide to arrive at 5:45 (our hours are clearly stated and we are rushing to finish last minute details before we open, but that is ok please let yourself right in) You might think 'Hey I deserve a table I'm the first one here!' well on a busy night every fucking seat I have is reserved for someone elses ass...not yours. And if you bitch and moan it is just going to make me hate you more...because I am protecting my customers who secured their reservation sometimes weeks in advance and I'm not going to fuck up their reservations because you are a dumbass and think you can walk right in and have whatever table you want on a friday night. What will get you a table...""Hi I am so sorry I'm early, I realize you guys are still setting up and I apologize for getting in the way. We don't have a reservation but is there any way if we hang out at the bar for a while and you have anything open up maybe we could be sat for dinner?""If you act like that I will do my absolute best to give you the fist table that opens up from a cancellation or a no show. And If I do get you a table a thank you and maybe even a small tip would be a very nice show of gratitude for going out of my way to try and accommodating you."

My friends took me here as part of my bachelor party weekend in Montreal, and this was easily the highlight of the trip for all of us.  While we had some issues with our reservation in the beginning, and the hostess was extremely rude, this was more than offset by the service at the table, which was friendly and very quick. I'm not going to go into too much detail about the food because I think the other reviews speak for themselves, but I'm just going to say flat-out that this was the best meal of my life (and all of my friends felt the same way).  I had the Poutine au foie gras and the classic Canard en conserve (Duck in a can), followed by the Pouding chômeur for dessert. Most of us ordered different entrees, but we were all in agreement that the Duck in a can was second to none. Very indulgent and fatty food but an unforgettable experience. All in all, this meal was an epic win, and I would come back to Montreal just for this."

The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.  How do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can?"

HUGE portion so i had to take some home - lunch tomorrow. :) the burger is made of foie gras and regular beef mixed in w/ this special pink vinaigrette sauce. all the flavors just blended perfectly. love the casual vibe of the restaurant. our entire row of tables (5) were all american. funny. we have come to realize that good food in montreal is more affordable. our meal was $100 or so and i think it would have been at least $150 in sf. hubs only ordered a beer too so no alcohol included. how did i forget the french onion soup??? a must order if you like to have some soup with your cheese. devoured in cheese and one of the best we have ever had anywhere in the world. divine! for dessert, we had the baked apple and it hit home since we didn't want anything too decadent eg., chocolate. service was good and friendly. DEFINITELY coming back the next time we are in town to try other items on the menu. leave yourself some time to explore the shops as well."
