/user_details?userid=hPnspn3tgk6PRCvrbsYDLw,Chris H.,"Hamilton, OH",5 star rating,"Absolutely my favorite meal while in Montreal. Having been to Saigon, VN twice I fell in love with Hu Tieu Nam Vang and have had a hard time finding anything similar outside of Vietnam.   We all ordered the Hu Tieu Nam Vang which is a pork based broth with noodles, pork, shrimp, fried tofu and various veggies. Absolutely delicious  when eaten with giò cháo quy, (Chinese cruller/donut). The giò cháo quy you have to ask for but I highly recommend it. Had to park on the street as there is no parking lot and upon walking up to the door we didn't' realize but the place is on the second floor. The sign on the door is old and faded and we initially thought they were out of business."
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the best hu tiu nam vang! Small place on a second floor.The soup is flavourful and taste authentic. They are specialized in hu tiu soup, so you won't find pho or other noodle soup in their menu.The main reason why i did not give a 5 stars is due to the cleanliness of the place. The tables are quite sticky...and the place itself doesn't look that clean. But who cares right? The food is great! **they are closed on Wednesdays"
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid authentic Viet restaurant offering one of the most authentic soups I've had. This is my second favourite Hu Tieu Nam Vang place in Montreal (first place I have to keep for myself). This restaurant is a hidden gem! Food: brought my Vietnamese friend here and even she said that the soup is authentic. We had the Hu Tieu Nam Vang (one dry one with soup) and some fried Chinese Donut bread. The Chinese donut wasn't as good but the soup was definitely mouthwatering, flavourful and authentic. The ice coffee with milk is also a classic to have. Service: the waiter was so friendly and looked very joyful, and that puts me in a good mood too. Only con is that parking is a bit difficult."

Whether you get the wet or dry noodles (with the soup on the side) - both are great options! I can't get enough of this place! Everything about it is adorable, even the fact that it's randomly on the second floor from a carpet store (lol). The avocado smoothie is a must-try, but I personally prefer the iced coffee with condensed milk, it's both strong and smooth."
/user_details?userid=zvFQl7FHhXyfuCbaZbIBSQ,Jobye-Kyle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Phnom Penh is probably Côtes-des-Neiges' best kept secret and has been open for over 20 years. Having lived in Toronto and Seattle, I make a point to come to Phnom Penh anytime I'm back in Montreal, haven't found any other restaurant like it in other cities! The go-to for me is definitely the white noodle Phnom Penh soup served as 'kho', which is served with noodles and broth separate with some great garnishes and sauce on the noodles. It's delicious! Coupled with fried chinese bread to dip in the broth, you're in for a treat, get the spring rolls if you're real hungry as well, they're excellent. One bonus is that despite their restricted hours, they're usually always open on holidays, I've gone numerous times for lunch on Christmas eves and thanksgivings. Oh, and make sure to bring cash!"
/user_details?userid=aARnRUKWYbEX8IsnVr8sgw,Erin A.,"New Tripoli, PA",5 star rating,A+ Pho! Best broth I've ever had! Menu is very limited but when you make something so well you can't offer many options. Cash only! Highly suggest!
/user_details?userid=RZgoY-Z0NzpXA8PD-WcDOQ,Katthew O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There's a good reason this place has been around for over 30 years on an absolutely desolate stretch of road at the corner of Cote-des-Neiges and Jean-Talon . . . it's DELICIOUS.Phnom Penh serves up the best Cambodian soup in town. The restaurant is the definition of No Frills, but that makes it even more special. Cash Only, Lunch Only - so go for a bike ride on a nice day or catch the 165 Bus and try a bowl of their classic soup."
/user_details?userid=SFS2JB3c-NiVOjdqEB7AQA,Lloyd B.,"VA, VA",4 star rating,A plain restaurant but it's worthwhile if you want soup. The roast chicken is a good alternative if you're with someone that doesn't want soup. Coffee is still strong even if you refill the filter until the cup is full.
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I fell in love with this place the moment the food arrived. The soup was so flavorful. The fried dough just makes it better. Fresh and cold soursop drink!
/user_details?userid=zJNHkZeGFuyjz472lmGNTA,Wilson L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They don't serve the typical pho you expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. What they do serve is possibly the very best bowl of noodles in the city.Small, humble menu, served with heart, and at a ridiculously reasonable price.My girlfriend and I come here every single week."
/user_details?userid=hiEj-3X8gV4-kBNkySOSJw,Diana L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"For those of you who love pho, you must try this Cambodian noodle at Phnom Penh. It uses the same noodle but broth is very different. It is a clearer soup simmered with an abundance of pork bones making it very flavorful. You can either order the meal with soup or soup on the side. With soup on the side, noodles are mixed with a soya sauce and it is really good and you'll to taste the original flavor of the broth."
/user_details?userid=Y_idl1lNKpDJf01mdaR96Q,Lee H.,"Saint-Léonard, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The best H Tíu you can find in Montreal. The taste is very close to the street food in Saigon.
/user_details?userid=LoV8AyG3kKfoazz1NB1Cog,Phatchan D.,"Plano, TX",5 star rating,I have been eating here since I was little.... Still one of the best bowl of noodles and brings back all the good childhood memories. I always get the dry Hu Tieu and Chinese donuts to dip in the soup that on the side. Everytime we are in Montreal we must come here at least once.
/user_details?userid=R8Sh9zylVD2Ghpj6eylWBg,Siv H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Since moving away from Montreal and even having family members from Ontario try the dry ka tieu (kuy teav, kuy teiv) everyone still talks and raves about how delicious the dish from this establishment is to this day and I have a very large family. Everything from the savoury broth to the Chinese fried donuts on the side, I'm drooling typing this review! I now reside in Ontario and have not found anything close to this not even in Toronto's Chinatown! Everything has been a sad disappointment, mediocre copy with a pho broth. As a ex inhabitant of the city with my grandma still residing around cote des neige area this place is a must try if you love South East Asian cooking specifically Khmer food. If I'm in Montreal I make sure this is a priority stop along with the big orange and dic anns. Enjoy!"
