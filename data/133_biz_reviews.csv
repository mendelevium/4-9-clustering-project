/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"In Canada and Montreal authentic Mexican food so hard to come by. I mean we have been so polluted with Tex-Mex in this county that people think that Doritos, salsa and chicken soft tacos, burritos are Mexican food. So is a real refreshing discovery to have the experience to enjoy this little diddy for an organized group dinner. As you enter the restaurant you have the feel that it's going to be a special meal. The lighting is dim yet cozy. Soft music plays in the background and you have the feel that you are in for an authentic treat. We had a look at the menu but not knowing many authentic dishes we asked for a sample for all of us to enjoy. For me I'm no Mexican food expert but I do know a place that serves multiple mole dishes plus many items I have not head about must be the real deal. To get the party started I ordered a lime margarita. This I believe was a good starter drink to test how they prepare it. It came with coarse salt a nice mix of lime and tequila not overly sweet but well balanced between the salty rimmer and the tart yet sweet mix plus the blend of Tequila. Then small plates of fresh warm corn tortillas came out as small dishes of different taster plates covered our table. Everything had a very distinctive yet vibrant flavour and you could eat away till your tummy said ""no more"". The dishes are smaller here so not overly filling, not extremely heavy but yet freshly prepared. The ones I really enjoyed were the : The mole poblano con pollo. The cochinita pibil was a pork and corn based banana leaf wrapped steamed tamale with delicious mild banana leaf and cornmeal flavour. For those that like cheese, the Pastor con queso is amazing! Most of the dishes I didn't find very spicy but different than I have eaten before at any Mexican restaurant. No dish I sampled would I deem bad. Everything was excellent. I must come back and sample more. Thank you. Exquisite."

So I ordered nachos. Here is what the waitress brought me, saying brightly, ""nachos!""It's not nachos.Pretty place, but I guess words don't mean what I think they mean? One star for pleasant atmosphere and decor. One star for miserable bowl of sad naked chips being sold as nachos."
/user_details?userid=8o8FTy_rvKaC5YoQgZENgg,Yoonha K.,"Jersey City, NJ",1 star rating,"The service was ridiculously long,and slow. We were there yesterday as my friends visited me from Boston, but not kidding, it took 4 hours for us to finish the dinner. We got there around 7pm, waitress came at 7:40 to get our orders, then took another 1.5 hours to prepare the meal. By the time we finished, it was 11pm. We missed a show we were going after. Not recommended at all. Food was mediocre as well."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This cozy resto recently moved into it's new location on St-Laurent Blvd and I recently tried it out with our foodie group of friends. We truly loved the experience!  The resto is family run and is truly authentic Mexican cuisine!  The resto is beautifully decorated and so welcoming with it's bright warm orange colored walls. We were a group of 14 and that is the max group size they can accomodate. Their concept is tapas style and they have fantastic group menu options which include nachos, soup and 5 dishes to share including dessert all for 26$/person before taxes/tip!  So worth it for the great food quality!! We started off with nachos to share followed by their delicious soup!!  Next, we shared 5 main dishes eggplant , mushrooms, chicken in peanut sauce, porc, beef and bacon dish and their delicious potatoes!!!  They come will a basket of tacos so you can make your own tacos!!!  Everything was so delicious and packed with wonderful flavors...so tasty!  Did I also mention that you can ask for refills of the dishes!! Yes!!!! all included in the price. Lastly we had these delicious crepes covered in a warm caramel sauce!!!  Mamma mia did they were  so yummy and heavenly!!! The service was super friendly as well. I also had a strawberry daquiri which was so good!! This resto is great for friends get together, birthday celebrations and romantic evenings!  Will definately go back!!"

We actually went two times during our 5 day stay in Montreal. The owner and staff are so nice they make you feel at home. Muchas gracias por las atenciones, definitivamente recomendáremos el restaurante a nuestros amigos que visiten Montreal y esperamos volver pronto."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Was on a hunt for some good Mexican food. Came across this restaurant on Yelp; therefore, we decided to check this place out. I blame all those amazing pictures of the food on Yelp. It's a tapas place. We ordered sesame chicken, eggplant with cheese and nachos with guacamole. The guac was super yum! Sesame chicken was alright. And the eggplant tasted flavourful but was undercooked. Not sure if I would go here again because it's also a bit far from where I live. The customer service was really good. Upon asking I shared some honest feedback on the eggplant which was taken as constructive criticism. It looked like a family owned restaurant. The place is a bit small and kind of cute.  The service made up for the ok-tasting food :)"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you're a fan of authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place to go! Maria Bonita is run by a family that make traditional Mexican food with love. The aesthetic of this resto is also perfect for a date setting. It's dim but warmly lit with soft Latino music providing you with company during your meal. Furthermore, the service was exceptional and caring. I had a great time.Maria Bonita serves food in small caserola dishes accompanied with fresh corn tortillas (that are warm and smell amazing!). The caserolas depend on your selection, we asked our host different types of his most popular dishes and he delivered. My favorite was by far the cochonita pibli. You take a tortilla, add your meats/veggies, add cheese and YOU DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND STUFF YOUR FACE UNTIL YOU HATE YOURSELF.Just kidding but seriously.... the food is really good. I ordered a horchata to go with my meal and it was good.I mentioned the service being exceptional, it really is. Do ask them to try some of their most popular dishes, you won't regret it.With a large group, the price-tag was very reasonable. I'd definitely come back if I find myself in the area again."
/user_details?userid=BZvl_1BiElWJiKxHaVgfnw,Minal S.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,this is as authentic as you can get when it comes to Mexican food. The food was fresh and the pairings were delicious - also great beverage options!
/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",3 star rating,"Maria Bonita is a small little Mexican eatery, tucked away on Casgrain in the Mile End area.  They  make their own corn tortillas and offers items such as quesadillas, sopes, ceviches, soups, salads, and entrees such as mole poblano con pollo, rajas con crema, and bistec a la mexicana.  The hubs and I stopped by to pick up some quesadillas to-go, as I'd heard that they were quite addicting.  We weren't given a menu, so it would have been nice to know that there were different types available.  I just ordered the one with cheese; there was a generous amount of cheese within the corn tortilla, which was folded in half.  Just one piece, with a small cup of sweet salsa, just under $5.  The salsa did not help, so eating on its own was more preferred - maybe hot sauce?  I thought it was a little pricey for something so simple.  Staff were super friendly, and the restaurant itself is adorable - love the decor and the way that they have the authentic shawls on the tables as covers.  There is a minimum for CCs.+overpriced quesadillas+friendly staff+cute decor of the interior"

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have been waiting for so long to eat here. It's not bad, but relatively bland and ordinary for a Mexican place that is said to be very authentic. Lack of flavour really. I tried the pastor tacos, tortillas stuffed with potatoes and guacamole. Maybe this place shines in the more traditional homemade dishes but not sure I would go back to try them. The service was ok and decor very simple but clean. Again, reviews are consistently high, so maybe give it a try and decide for yourself :)"
/user_details?userid=8_VB4EgpEV6OH4InYdQkug,Cassie W.,"Merrimac, MA",4 star rating,They have excellent food with a lot of vegetarian options. The margaritas are also really good. The only thing I wish I had know in advance was the casseroles are small and i should have gotten an appetizer
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Authentic Flavour. Reasonable Prices.While so many other places are doing (or trying to do) Mexican 'cause it's hip, or cool, or ironic, or something, Maria Bonita is doing it because, well, they're actually Mexican. The menu is solidly authentic, taking basic Mexican fare up a notch without being over the top.Definitely a good spot for a quick lunch, but their dinner menu is what really makes a visit worthwhile."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"I was so happy to check this place out this weekend, it's one of those kinds of places you notice tucked away on a side street and think looks so sweet for years but somehow the timing doesn't work out or you forget and time goes by without you trying it. And then you do, and it's even better than you'd mythologized it in your mind. It's not trendy, it's classic. Dim and warmly lit it's perfect for romance or for any kind of happy soothing hangout. It's run by a family who make traditional Mexican food lovingly and with care. They serve small dishes that are kind of like casseroles, and warm fresh corn tortillas which you fill with the cheesey goodness from the casseroles making fresh tacos.  About two casseroles per person is perfect, and if, like us, you just want to try the best of everything, you can ask them to bring you a sampling of their most popular dishes, saving you the trouble of deciding so you can focus on the delicious work of eating. I really look forward to coming back!"
/user_details?userid=SdcUA96bH7xK5xB-4Hg-cQ,Sheenah K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really delicious and one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants you'll find in Montreal.  I used to live in New Mexico and it was so nice to eat authentic dishes in the traditional dishware.  Lovely little family-owned restaurant with great and friendly service.
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"If you don't mind waiting a bit for your meal, this is probably the most legit Mexican food you'll find in Montreal. Each of the taco plates come in little casserole dishes with a basket of soft taco shells on the side, so unlike other taco joints, you have the ability to portion control. I got one order of the cactus tacos and another of the shrimp: both were superb, and ample for one person. Granted, I filled up on guacamole first, but you probably will too so we're cool. Warning: these guys are not messing around with their hot sauce. Use it with caution."

S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"This place is cozy and authentic, they serve the best Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had quite a lot) and the horchata's are delicious! Friendly staff too.

/user_details?userid=eFS6uTKsFqwwv2l9gAZHjA,Alex M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"We brought daughter and several friends for end-of-schoolyear dinner. This is really a ""mexican tapas"" joint -- everything is small plates, you get a couple for each person, and you can share everything around. This was a real treat vs. the usual tex-mex approach...and the food was better. Everything we had was fresh, several were very good and the rest were at least pretty good. The service was attentive and friendly. One of the waiters talked us back after we were about to order what he thought was too much food -- he was right, we ended up with a great variety and just the right amount. Nothing really blew us away, hence not a 5-star, but everything was very good and overall a totally worthwhile experience."
/user_details?userid=HXVx8dG5KxQZog6kdDraWg,Nicole S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"No tacos here!Cozy corner spot with a little terrace decorated in ranch style. Dishes are served ""casserole"" style, where each diner picks a few small plates and shares with the table. I sampled the nopales, chille relleno, an excellent pork dish with pineapple and the black beans with cheese. The menu included a selection of at least 15 different casseroles ranging from chiles to chicken, steak and even shrimp. Also a selection of starters and a table d'hôte offering. Chips, salsa, tortillas and toppings included. And of course, margaritas, beer and wine. Was a fun dunning experience and the food was tasty but it doesn't come cheap. Each dish runs $6-9+, two dishes per person plus a tecate...don't expect to leave for less than $30 a head. That being said, worth a try if you've been searching for that elusive Montreal Mexican food fix!"
/user_details?userid=LAiZI-in_wAaEEN0JmJQ9A,Brianne C.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved my experience there ! The owner, who was very friendly, explained the menu since it was our first time there. We tried the Paloma drink (very sour!) and the mexican-style beer which was definitely an experience!For the food, guacamole is out of this world and my sopa azteca was warm and delicious. My boyfriend tried the stuffed eggplant and the pepper which were both delicious ! I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. It takes a while to receive the food, so do not go there if you're in a hurry. But it's like you're a guest in a Mexican family and they're cooking a delicious meal for you."
/user_details?userid=7LLcv4GVOHQG8ydgr_zn2Q,Lydia H.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,I went to Maria Bonitas on a recommendation from a Montreal Blog. We are from DC and needed to find good food in a new city. I could not recommend Maria Bonitas more!!! It was the only place we went to twice. We miss it and wish we had a restaurant like it in the DC area. Their choriqueso was phenomenal. Their mole chicken was perfect. They have their pineapple pork wrapped in a banana leaf that I still think about weekly. I know it'll be my first stop next time we head to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=zwLI3VgkhMPT1bwG_K0qmA,Amelia S.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Cosy, friendly staff, lots of delicious options... I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu! I don't even remember what I had, just a smattering of casseroles and lots of mojitos. Definitely the best Mexican I've had in Montreal (which isn't saying much - seems to me there is a deficit of good Mexican food here) and I will definitely going back."
/user_details?userid=E6Bpe3XCKGbv3S7nPHUxJg,J F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is delicious and the drinks are amazing. However, for the price paid, service was on the slow side. My water glass was empty more often than not (a key indicator) and the bill took more than 5 minutes to prepare when we were just anxious to pay and leave. Come only if you have lots of patience."
/user_details?userid=XI4zORGFTzGe1nv7LHgkIw,Alex G.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Great restaurant with fine Mexican cuisine. Prices are very low for the quality and quantity. I would highly recommend it!
/user_details?userid=QyQ8jldZwSr1tniW0nQbyQ,Leo W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious! Service was warm and friendly too.  The majority of the menu consists of ""small casseroles"" that are shared tapas-style. The casseroles come with (and are eaten with) a generous stack of small, warm tortillas.We had three casseroles: the pastor con queso, chile nogada, and berenjenas gratinadas along with the azteca soup and quesedilla de chciharron, which was plenty of food for two people. The casserole and the soup were most memorable, and we look forward to returning again to try the other items on the menu. The cactus salad looks particularly interesting!"
/user_details?userid=DjF8Pu72gISlQbtbTbR4fQ,Guillaume B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"YEAH, For once, a real mexican restaurant !Not like all those american-mexicans cheap ones (Carlos & Pepe's, 3 amigos or El Zaziumm).They serve tapas version of their typical meals.Seriously, it's delicious and full of flavours.The service is very personalized and it might be because the restaurant's size;it's very small.You feel like you're a guest at their home.I've been there 3 times and I'll go back anytime."
