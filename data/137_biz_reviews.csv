/user_details?userid=ILwz5TcKyQhMuQp-zxXnJw,Jason K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Darbar has been and continues to be my favourite Indian restaurant for dinner.I believe the restaurant is run by a small family and the mother and son who are frequently working at the register are extremely friendly. They are keen on helping you navigate their extensive menu and extremely accommodating to diverse dietary restrictions, including a variety of meat and vegetarian options.I always opt for the window seating near the front. For awareness, it may be tricky to go to the bathroom as you'll need to pass through another floor seated table to leave the area - but I've never had any major issues yet.This is my go-to place every time I go to Montréal and I highly recommend their Baingan bhartha"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We decided to have dinner at Darbar. Husband and I ordered a Vegetarian Thali to share and our friends ordered two meat curries with rice. Everything was surprisingly delicious. I had walked by this establishment several times but never eaten here. My friend had tried the food at Darbar and urged us to meet them for dinner here and give it a shot. The food felt like it was home cooked, tasted authentic and felt healthy to eat! Our Thali had Chanay Curry, Vegetables Mix Sabzi, Samosa, Garlic Nan & Rice. The prices are reasonable! We were extremely happy with the service. Everyone was friendly, helpful and attentive. Would definitely recommend this spot!"

The atmosphere and decor match the quality of the food - high marks all around for the Jeera (cumin savory lassi) and their Pulao rice. The Tarka Daal was delicious and quite spicy but strange, as it features black beans (not a fan of those) for some reason, despite it being advised as having lentils. The Rasmalai (sweet paneer-based dessert) as a finishing touch to the meal was exquisite.The portions, especially the lassi, are *huge* and it's definitely good value for money in that regard. Service is attentive and friendly but in our case was a bit of a miss - we did book a table but it seems they didn't know where to seat us and opted for a corner cushioned table, way closer to the ground and more traditional but not as comfortable."
/user_details?userid=QBe3oadPKot2mtuh8jB1UQ,Gurvinder K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When a northern Indian person reviews a North Indian restaurant you better believe it;)The owner is from Punjab and has stayed true to many of the classic North Indian dishes, like saag paneer, channa patouray (deep fried fluffy naan like bread with chickpeas on the side)....I absolutely enjoyed eating at Darbar, the saag paneer consistency and taste reminded me with what I grew up eating at home. I went with the vegetarian thali with the option to chose one of my own dishes for an extra $3, which is a great option because you get to try onion pakora, papadum, rice, 1/2naan and 2 vegetarian dishes for less than $20. I didn't get to take a picture before I started devouring it!!The ambiance is also nice with an option to sit on cushions in secluded sections and experience traditional Indian style eating. Would definitely go back!"

The menu is extensive and the ""thali"" allows you to try a variety of their dishes for one person if you can't all decide on a combination. They accept reservations and we were seated in time and were even able to get a spot outdoors!However, the service was really horrible. We felt like we were being rushed the whole time, they kept approaching us to order even though our whole parties hadn't arrived and they seemed annoyed every time we told them we were not ready yet. In the end they even asked us to leave because people were waiting for our table without even warning us beforehand! Go for the food, not the service."
/user_details?userid=HC5zLdut4caN1VPqxqRsMw,Lana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Darbar might seem like a slightly upscale restaurant at first with its modern interior and dim lighting, but prices were very reasonable and almost inexpensive, especially after converting to USD! My friends and I came here for dinner a few weeks ago during our trip to Montreal. I had the saag paneer and we ordered two samosa appetizers to split among the four of us. There were two per order, so we each got one. The samosas were served on a fancy plate that had the sauce dish attached to it and hovering over the plate. They were delicious. I definitely thought about getting another order of the samosas. The saag paneer was standard. It was served with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, which I had never seen before and thought was an interesting touch. I did wish that they gave a larger portion of rice because I ran out of rice before I was even halfway done with the saag paneer. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4"
/user_details?userid=QBZVTIUBPeN2oO8BIG-wyA,Paul T.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Contrary to the reviews of most of the diners, my girlfriend and I experienced excellent service during our visit. The atmosphere made us feel like we were invited into someone's home. The appetizer we ordered, onion bhaji was fucking fantastic. The sauce that accompanied it was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet. We also ordered a mango lassi to share, which was extremely refreshing and not too sweet.That's where the praise for the food ends, unfortunately. I wanted to like this place was so badly, but the rest of what we ordered were mediocre and bland. Our order was chicken curry, lamb madras, naan and lamb biryani. There seems to be a city-wide phenomenon of 1. underseasoning food2. overcooking meatand this place was unfortunately a victim to this. What a shame. This review was solely based on the food; taking account the atmosphere elevates it to 3 stars."

First of all, one of the best Indian restaurant in Montreal. Today, we celebrated our friend's birthday and we wanted be authentic, so we took the seats on the floor. The mini tables were silver. The dishes were silvers, gold and copper. We had mango lassi, plain naan, Garlic naan (a recommendation by the manager... it was wow), madras lamb (spicy and delicious), chicken vindaloo (amazing), shrimp biryani (jumbo shrimps and very yummy), baighan bartha (smashed eggplants blended with great spices), ras malai (best milk desert) and masala chai. Everything was perfect! I ate so much, that I couldn't breathe anymore. My mouth wanted more but my belly had enough. The service was awesome! Highly recommended!!!"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid, slightly fancier than average indian food. My favorite part of this place is that you can order a thali and instead of getting the generic chicken curry you can pay a little bit to swap it for any of their meat dishes (you can do the same for the veggie thali). It's awesome because when I'm at Indian restaurants I often want a little bit of everything, but the meat dishes that generally come in thalis are more boring than the rest of the menu. Chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and lamb rogan josh are all great!It's a pretty small restaurant but it's got a nice vibe and there's a table near the window where you can sit on the floor kind of it you want to. Service is normally fast and nice."

See pic2) The onion Bhaji was soggy despite the quick delivery. It was not mild as expected, as the real hot yogurt, mint, hot green peppers dip were the only thing supposed to be hot ...see pic3) The Pulao Basmati fried with onions and spices ended up being a boiled rice with green peas and corn kernels ...see pic4) The Shrimp Rogan Josh supposed to be mild in a thick sauce ended up with overcooked shrimps in a medium hot soupy tomato sauce ...5) The butter sauce chicken was anything but buttery and the chicken was a pack of striny breast .. see pic6) The Lamb Korma had nice chunks of tender meat, the sauce was very tasty but on the thin side with maybe too much coconut milk added at the last minuteIn summary the $80.00 before tax and tip diner ended up in the high speed garbage disposal in the sink instead of the fridge for a lunch tomorrow.Super disappointed but that's maybe be their quality control on the delivery service.Anyway buyer beware ..."

Darbar has nice ambiance for a date night. I got the thali with saag paneer, thanks to the suggestion of the lovely waitress. I also ordered the vegetable korma, which had a nice kick of spice. Both were creamy and flavorful. You also can't go wrong with the mango and sweet lassi. Bomb cheese naan. If I come back to Montreal, I'll be back for more!Overall, you can't go wrong: good ambiance, reasonably priced, and delicious!! Bless the hands of the chef!"
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Initially, I reserved for 8 people. In the end, we were down to 4 people. To communicate my reservation with the waitress, it was not easy at the beginning but we eventually settled the reservation date and time correctly. When we arrived, the place was packed with customers enjoying their dinner on a beautiful Saturday evening. One of my friends arrived late but the waitress still takes out his order despite him being over an hour late. The service was top notch for an ethic restaurant and I was pleasantly surprise at the professionalism in this place. I ordered the butter chicken, I didn't like it that much because it was a bit too spicy for me. The naam cheese bread, the mango lassi and the dal soup were very delicious. Now, I am going to be raving about the Naam Cheese bread whenever I think about this restaurant. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I hope to come back to try other dishes in the menu."

The food is mediocre and service is non-existent. White rice is not included with entree but they sent it to us anyway and charged us for it.We tried this while visiting Montréal and were highly disappointed. Go some place else if you're looking for authentic Indian food.

I picked up take out from them this evening and was missing one of the main items in the order (butter chicken) which I realized when I got home. I called them immediately to say I would pick it up later or I would need a refund and the manager treated me extremely rudely, refused to do either, told me they were busy, and hung up the phone on me! Shockingly bad customer service.I will not return and do not recommend."

The rest of the group had the butter chicken and a vegetarian plate.  The samosas were TO DIE FOR, with a slightly spicy sauce drizzled over top.This gem off the beaten path of downtown Montreal is well worth the walk or ride.  Call ahead for reservations, as the place is small and can only seat about 8 parties at a time."
/user_details?userid=7uCyqQEqKcD5aBF0EocW6Q,Kristi H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My husband and I made a reservation for 6:30pm. When we arrived the only place on the main level was a small table with floor seating. My husband is 6'2"" and can barely touch his knees....if he was able to get down onto the floor pillows, getting up would be a real challenge.  So we opted to be seated upstairs.  The decor is carried only on part of the upper level. We were seated in the sketchy back room right next to the toilet room. Literally my husband would have to move his chair forward to let someone use the facilities. I personally think the back area should be curtained off and nobody should be seated there. We ordered the samosa and it was very tasty. I had the Biryanis Agneau and it was very bland. I ate a few bites and took the rest home to spice it up. My husband had the Madras Agneau and he thought it was average. I will not be returning."
/user_details?userid=ylE_w4QR7JCz9cr9ub9l3A,Ashley T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,Easily in my top 5 favorite Indian food in my life is from Darbar. Visiting Montreal with the family we always have to have Indian food on the trip. Montreal has it's European influences and I remember clear as ay that the Indian food I had in Europe was some of the best I've ever had. They have a lovely outdoor seating area right along the street and the trees give you shade while you eat and people watch. My family ordered a few dishes and my dad ordered the chicken platter plate. Everything was awesome. Service is attentive and the owner also comes around and makes his rounds to greet his customers. I love when owners do that because it really shows how important their store is to them. The only sad thing about this establishment is that it's not closer to where I live (in America). You were one of my favorite meals of my Montreal trip Darbar!

We were warmly welcomed on a cold night even though there were 5 of us and we had no reservation. Wonderful cosy atmosphere and the food itself is absolutely superb.

/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,A wonderfully intimate Indian restaurant in downtown Montreal. It's a small restaurant so table space is limited. For those seeking something different there is a pillow section where you can eat sitting on the floor. A wide variety of choices are on the menu with a lot of attention put into both the meals and the details of the experience. I've been a few times now and have never been disappointed. Lastly the hosts and servers couldn't have been nicer. A great experience
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend LOVES this place and takes us every time we're in the area, which is about once a month. We're mostly vegetarians, so we tend to go for a selection of the impressively varied vegetarian dishes, usually the ones involving spinach or paneer. I'm originally from England, where the curry is excellent, so my standards are quite high and I'm rather picky about how I like my curry (not overly sweet, fresh and spiced, creamy without being so tomatoey it tastes like a pasta sauce). Darbar delivers!Though I would prefer more options on the paneer curries to match the range offer d for chicken, lamb and seafood, I found the shahi dish quite good. The portions are a little small, perhaps, but rich and flavourful all the same - I would like to have more to facilitate sharing in larger groups, but maybe I'm spoiled by British Indian restaurants that give you so much you always end up with leftovers. At Darbar we're often left mopping the bowls clean with naan bread rather than having any leftovers!The prices, I think, are reasonable, and the mango lassi is an excellent and generous accompaniment to the meal at about $4 or $5. I'm definitely coming again!"
/user_details?userid=f0cBhET4XigHvQUDIY6jSA,Svetlana R.,"Kew Gardens, NY",1 star rating,"Ok, let me explain why was the Darbar the worst eating out experience we had and we eat out a lot. We had a reservation at 7:30 we were actually seated at 8:10. We were suggested by the owner to order everything at once, because kitchen was very busy. Ok... the food started to arrive one to two dishes at the time from 9:30 till 10:30. At that time we had to remind the waiter that we have no plates or utensils, and don't forget that some of the food is already on the table. So now, the plates were brought out not all at once, but few at the time and than finally utensils. That's not all, now sometime during the meal we realized that one person didn't get the ordered dish, so the owner comes out and aggressively argued trying to prove to us that everything was served, by counting dishes on the table.I am in a customer service for over 30 years, I have never seen anything like that. Believe it or not that's not all.... At the end we still realized that another dish was missing, but we let it go. Now.... my friend ordered a drink and on the way to the wash room saw something indescribable at the bar, that she canceled her drink order  Right on the spot. I understand that we had s party of 14 people, but that was not an excuse for such incompetents. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, the food was ok, service horrible."

Both the pastry and filling were well made and tasty.For mains we had a chicken thali, substituted the chicken curry for lamb vindaloo. Each item on thali was well prepared and individually spiced. The vindaloo was more than a hot red curry that is sometimes not well flavored, it was well spiced and also very hot at the same time. One of the best we have tried.Also had the lamb biryani which was well cooked and had a good ratio of meat to rice. Very very tasty.In the cold Montreal winter, I can't imagine a more satisfying meal!"

It was a small family owned business which we loved. We walked in and saw a huge Indian family dining there which was a plus. Everyone was nice from beginning to end. OH AND THE FOOD...hands down DELICIOUS. You can tell the chef cooks with lots of LOVE. I ordered butter chicken which seemed to one of the popular dishes. It was excellent. My friend ordered chicken vindaloo, she loveeedd it. It was very spicy to her liking. She also ordered mango juice and loved it as well. Please visit when you go to Old Montreal. It is worth it.

Yelp told me this place had great reviews so I popped in and was greeted by friendly staff.I started with a mango lassi and decided to go with the thali with chicken for my main and was overwhelmed by the giant platter presented to me. And I think the staff were overwhelmed and impressed by the fact that I ate the entire thing and then asked for dessert.I particularly loved the lentils and the curried chicken. Yes, the tandoori chicken was tender and delicious too, but the curried chicken was delicately spiced and awesome.For dessert, I had gulab jamun, which were warm and delicious."

/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my new fav Indian restaurant in Montreal. Indian cuisine is one of my all time favourite so finally I decided to give it a shot.Arriving there, I saw how cute the decor is as well as traditional. I was already totally in love with this restaurant. The waiter helped me to get seated, he gave me options to have my meal on the cushions on the floor with the little cute silver table or the regular table with chair and I went for the first one. I had to remove my shoes to be seated on the floor with the comfy Indian cushions which is of course how people eat in India traditionally. I was fascinated by this gesture as it's amazing to re-create those feelings when you've having your food. I was given the menu and it totally stole my heart as they have a story of how they started and the history of the authentic North Indian food. The cover is so well represented with designs. So, I opted for the chicken thaali. After waiting for like 10-15 minutes, my food arrived and I got so excited to eat and it didn't disappoint. Their naan, omg are so soft and crunchy. Love the presentation of the thaali. It consisted with the dal, the chicken curry, side of tandoori chicken and vegetables curry and salad with the chutney. I just crushed it all and I would say excellent way to present your food, the decor, service, attention to details. I just LOVE IT and will recommend it to all of you if you really want to try authentic Indian food. The price was reasonable for the thaali with so much food, I paid $16.10 including taxes which is amazing! So much good things about the restaurant and food. One word: Exceptional"

We were quickly seated on the terrace around 7pm and given beautiful menus. We decided on the onion bhaji, butter chicken, Baltic chicken, butter and garlic naan, raita and rice. The bhaji came out quickly and was seriously the best I've ever had! Not too oily, full of flavor, and topped with delicious pomegranates and sauces. The mains arrived quickely after in gorgeous plates/bowls and were pretty delicious. The butter chicken was rich and different than the sweet variety you usually get elsewhere, while the Baltic chicken was super spiced and jam packed with flavor! The raita was perfect and the naan was the fluffiest I've ever had. Our only complaint was that the rice was dry and pretty flavorless. Otherwise great food, service and price (total bill was under $60)! Will be back!"

She accused our group of lying about it and touched everything on the table, lifted and sniffed every plate. When she realized that she was mistaken, no apologies were made for her bizarre behavior. She just looked disappointed and wondered off.Eating at Darbar was the worst experience a group of friends and I've ever had at a restaurant.

/user_details?userid=U2w9R3Esa_ylJjBHfHIFkA,Tess O.,"Pinecrest, FL",5 star rating,"Unbelievable restaurant! We were able to snag a last minute reservation on Valentine's Day while visiting Montreal for our honeymoon. Needless to say, I am SO glad we were able to experience this restaurant.The decor, for one, is beautiful, romantic, and authentic. They have regular tables as well as tables on the floor where you'll need to remove your shoes. The menu itself is not just pretty to look at (seriously, they outdid themselves with the design of the menus), but very expansive. They had categories for all types of curries, entrees, side dishes, traditional drinks, wines...As an appetizer we got the samosas. They were so so good! I generally really dislike them and just let my husband order them, but these samosas come with a delicious drizzle of some kind of sweet sauce as well as another dipping sauce that really made them phenomenal.For one of our entrees we opted for the thali (could be wrong on the name, but it was a sampler platter) that comes with rice, two types of naan, a curry of your choice (some have a $3 upcharge), rice, chickpeas, and a veggie themed dish. For our curry, we chose the Vindaloo (the spiciest option) with lamb (the meats have no bones, yay!!!) and it was great. The meat was tender and fell apart in your mouth. The level of spiciness was definitely spiced for non-Indians (according to my spice-loving Arab husband), but in my opinion it was the perfect amount of spice to give you that hot sensation while still allowing you to taste all of the flavors in the curry.For my entree I ordered the butter chicken with a side of rice (this is extra, it normal doesn't come with any sides.) I really recommend getting rice to pour the butter sauce on and eat the chicken with. This was my all time favorite dish here and I would go back just for that.My husband also tried the yogurt drink with cumin and loved it. It's the best yogurt drink he has had, and he said they made it way better than the way Arabs do it! Lol.The portions were perfect for the price. We thought this was the best priced and best tasting meal we had during our entire stay in downtown Montreal."

As I made my way down St Laurent, i didn't have it in mind, but crossing it after all these years, something finally clicked. It's a cozy little space, but I was promptly seated. I ordered the meat thali, and was served in minutes. Without even tasting it, I knew I had made the right choice. It had the perfect balance of meat and veg, and was served with not just rice, but also naan and a papadum! Every dish was delish, every plate was great. It was one of the best thalis I've had in Montreal. I won't ramble, and I can't speak to the rest of the menu, but after tasting that thali, I'm sure that it lives up to the hype."

Because here at Darbar I was served by some amazing people who fed me some incredible food. Everything here is very thoughtful and I would even say elegant. The space is very ambient- filled with cozy nooks were diners can sit on pillows to eat their meal, subdued lighting, and beautiful Indian textiles. The waitstaff were all amazing, very thorough without being smothering. And the food, wow the food. I asked for my dish to be prepared ""very spicy"" and while it wasn't hot enough for me, they still made it pretty spicy!!! The naan was near perfect, airy and crispy and covered in garlic, perfect for sopping up their amazing curry. Darbar reminds me of some of my favorite Indian food experiences from my 10 years in NYC, it's as good as almost anywhere I ate during that period.      To top off my more than positive experience here, the chef came out at the end of my meal and asked me how it was. How many places does that happen at??? Not many. Darbar is a special place. If you want a great dining experience with delicious food this is the place."

There's a lot of seats here, you can feel crammed in, but with Indian food, and it's sort of sharing nature, you don't mind at all...that is my only gripe.A friend and I came here. On a Saturday with no reservations, chanced it and got the only two seats left. The rest of the night they were turning people away. It's busy. For good reason.The chicken tikka starter was superb, came with a yoghurt dip and lettuce. Cooked to perfection- not dry at all. Popadoms were a blend of spicy and normal, with a mango chutney dip. Mains were great too. I had a dansak, which I must confess I didn't think was spicy enough, but, that was my issue. I ordered it from the mild section. The taste was superb. Naan bread was also cooked well, I had a garlic, my companion a plain. A separate shout out for the tiger beer, not lager, beer...that they were serving. Lovely flavour and ideal for a curry.Price was great, around $40 for two drinks and a meal. Will recommend and pass on to anyone I can. Very pleasant experience."

I walked in at 9:50PM and was greeted at the door with a: ""Kitchen closes at 10PM; we're closed.""...wait. Yelp says 10:30...I'd walked about a kilometer in - 12C. Wtf.I think my sadness and confusion must have been obvious as I stood by the door trying to use Yelp to find an alternative in the area. As an out-of-towner, I'm reliant on the Internet because I won't know about local places offhand. As I was dejectedly looking for dinner, the lady at the bar offered me to order carryout. Whew.I took her up on the offer and ordered shahi paneer, rice, naan, and raita. Everything was okay, but not overly delicious. The raita was really different than any I've had (either from home in the US or India); I wasn't a fan and didn't eat it. The shahi paneer was very watery and the rice felt rather undercooked. Nothing that rendered the food inedible though."

I wish I was hungrier as I wanted to try several things on the menu.  But my husband and I ordered one dish each.- Papad to start with.- Chole Bhatura  (this is listed as Chef's specialty): I have eaten this dish at many restaurants, including in India, so I know what good chola/bhatura (chickpea/fried bread) tastes like.  The chickpea was cooked perfectly.  Most restaurants don't boil the chickpea enough, leaving it hard.  This was perfectly cooked and the spices were blended in to perfection.  The Bhatura was not the huge fried bread that you see at most restaurants (see the picture I posted).  I wanted to go back to this restaurant during our trip to eat this again. Yes - it's that good.- My husband got Chicken Tikka Masala and cleaned out his plate. The chicken was tender and tasted as good as it does in India.We were too full to try any dessert, but I wanted some tea.  But since I was pregnant, I wanted something non-caffeinated. The owner recommended trying their Ginger Tea which is made fresh in the kitchen. The tea has a blend of ginger, orange peel, lemon peel, anise, bay leaves, and cinnamon. There is no milk in the tea.  OMG - the tea was sooo good!!! I am craving that tea as I sit at my office desk right now.This restaurant has excellent service, and great food.  A must try if you are looking for Indian food during your stay in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=myPvFZU9ORxGvK_aV1o-qg,Nutan P.,"Matawan, NJ",2 star rating,"I don't understand why this place gets praises  or why it's so popular amongst people of Montreal. Don't think at all if you think this is ""fine Indian dining"" because the owner will make it seem more like a daba (streetside Indian foodhouse) because she'll eat in front of the guests and take FaceTime calls in front of the guest and finally play YouTube videos on full blast while the guest are eating. Please show some respect and class in front of your customer, handle private matters in the back, not while we are trying to have dinner at your restaurant.This place charges $13-15 for a veggie entree and says the quantity is enough for one person, this may be true but that's a lot for such small quantities. The quality of the food wasn't even that great. It wasn't spicy, it was pretty bland. I asked for salt and pepper and they only gave me salt, I guess they don't believe in pepper.If you want the small quality tasting food for 75% less, do yourself a favor and go to your local trader Joe's and get their Indian dish, they'll probably give you bigger portions then this place for only $3-4.Also, this place automatically tacks on a ""service charge"" which is automatic 15% tip. How do ""fine dining"" places automatically add on gratuity for parties of 3?!? Shows you how classy this is place is. Do yourself a favor and go to Singh's down the road for a better experience."

On the other side was a heater which was off and there was a visible drill hole in the wall.Otherwise the decoration is nice, the menu and the small metal tables are pieces of art.Service: 1.5/5.

I came here with my boyfriend looking for some Indian food and was recommended this place. Firstly, customer service was downright awful. I felt so uncomfortable as the owner kept lingering by waiting for us to make up our minds. The glasses for water were dirty and even when we poured water into them there was a thin layer of oil or gunk floating. This was horrendous. Food wise - not good. I am of Indian descent so I expected food to be of a certain standard; especially for the prices we were going to pay for them!! Rice is charged extra as is naan but the curry was thin and watery, lackluster at best and lacked spice, taste and any kind of care! It was as if everything was just dumped together and water added to make it a curry! I had a measley 3-4 pieces of chicken and overall I was really upset with my experience here. The bar where drinks are prepared looks dirty and I took a look into the kitchen and the standard of hygiene was just atrocious. I felt ashamed that this was Indian food and felt cheated to pay around $25 to eat absolute rubbish with even worse customer service to boot!! My boyfriend is not Indian but even he was pretty appalled at this whole experience. Never coming back ever again. This is not how Indian food is supposed to taste so if it's your first time trying it please don't go there!!"

We ventured for dinner here on our last night in Montreal, a Sunday. From the outside this restaurant is very unassuming, so much that we skimmed right past it on our travels a few days earlier. Upon entering you are swept away on an Indian holiday as the aromatic spices fill the air. There are quite a few tables with floor seating however we were seated at a more modern style table. Once seated we were handed their beautiful menus, making me eager to set sail on our culinary adventure. Being a Brit I'm quite familiar with Indian cuisine and grew up with my mother cooking it in the house on special occasions. Because of this I have very high expectations. To start we had an order of samosas and our dinner partners had the same as well as some onion bhaji. Both were very good! For dinner we each opted for a Thali, and I customized mine to come with seafood. As we waited for the entrees we sipped our drinks. As a former bartender, this would be the only place I would deduct any stars if anything. I ordered a litchi martini which came up in a glass, but it was filled with ice which was a bit awkward. When served up, a martini should always be strained. It was delicious though, so I forgive it. It seemed like no time at all before our dinners were on the table. Being the first time I've ordered Thali, I must say the metal plates looked much bigger in person. Every dish in it was perfectly balanced in seasoning and cooked excellently. We were all in heaven with every dip of our naan. The shrimp tandoori had a nice amount of heat to it and the shrimp korma was so creamy and delicious! We each finished every morsel on our plate. I honestly would have licked it clean if I was at home. We were too stuffed to have dessert so that will have to wait till next time I'm in this city. Till then I'll be having dreams of Montreal's Darbar."

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really like this place. My favourite here is the tandoori dishes (esp. chicken). Why? Darbar has a license to cook with coal in their kitchen - few other restos have this in town. The primary benefit? The ability to cook tandoor stuff ""a la minute"". Consequently, the dish leaves the kitchen sizzling, full of aroma, and still moist. Think about the last thing... how often do you get moist tandoori chicken? It's usually quite dry because it's cooked in advance and left at low heat to be given ""faux a la minute"" to customers - thus drained of its moisture and juices. Darbar has the luxury of avoiding that culinary travesty. That alone makes the place worth. Their other dishes are quite good as well and the owners are fabulous people."

/user_details?userid=tsLvnMkia6SVeCz0tzQ-RA,Eric P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I am basing my review on last night's experience. I first started going to Darbar when I first moved to Montreal. It was always the best Indian restaurant nearby when I lived in or around downtown. I loved the hole-in-the-wall decor, I loved the fact that it was family owned, and I especially loved the terrasse in the back. Over time things change. A couple years ago the quiet terrasse out back turned in to a terrasse on the street just like everyone else. I was told the reason for this was due to the growth in popularity of the restaurant, and the kitchen needed to expand into the back yard. This was obviously disappointing. But I kept going regardless of where the terrasse was and what season I was in. Why? The food was and still is excellent. I nor anyone I have ever brought to this restaurant has ever had anything even close to bad food. Last night, however, I had bad service, and that's hugely disappointing. I made a reservation for 8:45 on a Monday night. The restaurant closes at 9:30. I know it's late. I didn't intend on staying until 11. But me and my boyfriend arrived on time and there were clients finishing up their meal. So we ordered a few dishes and a bottle of wine. If the restaurant is open until 9:30 on a Monday, I should be able to order at 8:45 and not feel like a burden. We were not fussy, rude, unpleasant, etc.. Our bill was probably around $100 before tip. Any server would know that this table was ""worth it"". But we weren't worth it. The lights came on at 9:15, the staff started gossiping and discussing amongst themselves, they kept asking us if we were done and if the food was alright, but it was all such an obvious hurry to get us out. The worst part is this: I love Darbar. I bring all my friends to Darbar. I brought my boyfriend to Darbar. I'm faithful and loyal. I met the owner of Darbar for the first time last night! He was sweet and kind and everything you could hope a restaurant owner and chef to be! But his staff? I know it's family owned. That doesn't mean you get to bully people out when you're tired and want to go home. Especially when your last table made a reservation and you knew ahead of time that there would be people staying until closing. I don't know if I'll go to Darbar again. I never had bad service until yesterday, but it was undeniably bad service. My suggestion would be to not stay open or be open on a Monday night if the staff is unwilling to be accommodating. At least the food is good."

The Naan was average. The chai was like water. When the dishes came, my lamb madras was not spicy enough and too watery. Too much tomato. The other dishes that we ordered had the same issue.

Everything from the curries, to the roti, samosas were all delicious. There was a bit of a wait during dinner time (30 mins) but it was worth it. The place is small with about 10 tables. There are traditional style seating arrangements where you sit on the floor as well as regular tables. I opted for the latter because I can not cross my legs for an extended period of time (painful). The owner checked on our table several times to ask how the food was which was nice. I will return to Darbar if I return to Montreal and in the mood for good Indian food!"

We had a reservation and were seated right away - even on a busy Saturday night. Service was phenomenal. The staff was so friendly and sweet when we had questions about the menu.Their indoor seating is so authentic, with floor pillows for an old-time Indian dining experience, and they also have plenty of table seating. Their tableware was copper/aluminum, just like you would traditionally be served in India. As with many Indian restaurants, the food is served family style. Our party of three ordered two meat dishes (lamb korma and chicken tikka masala) with naan and vegetable fried rice. We were full to the brim, and also had a bit left over. For dessert we all loved the raas malai (basically a creamy cheese dumpling).  When in Montreal, don't skip this place - You won't regret it."

We made reservations but for 630 on a Tuesday there really was no need. They had patio seating available but we chose to sit inside on the floor seating with pretty cushions! The menu itself is gorgeous as well as the decor. Service was speedy although most conversation was referred to the BF as opposed to me - we laughed about it! The food was delicious. A lot more filling than it looked with beautiful presentation. We ordered two samosas to start and I had the shrimp korma with naan. Sides don't come with dishes so keep that in mind. The naan was crispy yet fluffy and paired perfectly with the flavourful shrimp (even though the shrimp was a wee bit over cooked). We were able to take leftovers home, thankfully so, as we had a lot left on our plate!I'd reserve Darbar for special occasions since they are a bit pricy in comparison to other delicious Indian spots around town - but the ambience is perfect for dates and celebrations."

When we went in at 8pm, we asked for seating inside and the lady owner was pretty pushy in insisting that we sit outside and eat. It had just rained outside so the chairs were wet. And my family was willing to wait for a table inside. Nonetheless, we chose to eat outside. I didn't like the pushy attitude. The 4 of us were in a table with 6 chairs. And we were asked to move to a smaller table by the servers for a larger group that was coming. I mean why didn't they set up their tables properly? This is not proper customer etiquette. And coming to the food, they use the same exact masala for all their entree curry items. The Aloo Gobi and Navratan Korma had the same exact sweet taste. And the Navratan korma had way more potatoes than expected. Usually, kormas have a healthy mix of other vegetables. This was just lazy cooking. Only saving grace was the taste of the biriyani and naan. Our experience as customers was simply bad."

Still worth it. Tandoori chicken that *hasn't* been sitting under a heat lamp for hours and fresh papadams and naan. Word."

Some aspects were great but other were really a let down.It was my first time there so I wasn't expecting anything in particular. here are the up and down of resto Darbar.good: you can choose either to sit on the ground for a little more fun or at a table if you want to be comfortablebad: the pillows on the floor are so thin and the table-like piece of wood are so cheap and wobbly it made me wish I took a table.good: the staff is really nice. They really want you to like their food and they are concerned about your happiness.bad:They only speak English in a partial way. It ended up in incomplete comprehension.good: best naan bread ever! I wished I would've ordered a bunch. only that. Next time I go, I'll tell them to provide the naan until I can't walk.bad: when the menu says, two vegetable of the day. What it really means is cheap, old salad with one broccoli. The rice didn't taste anything and was slightly under cooked.good: They offer a large range of heat. It can go from very tasteful and aromatic to 'oh my god! it burns my tongue! how can someone ever eat that!' depending on what you like. bad: very small wine choices. Also, they offer 'Indian' beer, but I saw a small local brewery make a delivery, the beer was served in a glass of that brewery and it tasted like a microbrewery beer. I'm not convinced what I drank came all the way from India.in overall, it's definitely good indian food and you should stuff your face with that naan bread."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to Darbar time and time again mainly because of its close proximity to the McGill campus, and I'm never disappointed with the quality of the food there. Yes, it is more expensive than your average Indian joint, but the quality and taste of everything offered completely make up for the cost. It also scores bonus points in my book for having a super nice layout and areas where you can sit in cushioned areas on the floor (although it can be a tight squeeze sometimes).Since I was alone, I couldn't afford to sample a wider variety of dishes, so I went with the usual meat thali and mango lassi. Trust me, I would normally order more in a large group, but I'd rather not have my wallet crying out in pain when I already have books and course materials to buy on top of some of my food excursions. I usually have the chai in the colder winter months and it is also amazing and perfectly spiced. They serve their drinks and non-thali dishes in these metal glasses and pail-like containers, which sounds impractical at first, but they're actually pretty light and hence adds to the overall presentation aspect. I still maintain that Darbar serves the best mango lassi I've had in Montréal, and they gave me a larger glass than usual so it was a win-win situation for me! The thali was absolutely nom-worthy and all of its components shined in their own ways, minus the greasiness that sometimes comes along with food in Indian restaurants. The tandoori chicken was juicy, the lentil dish was very homey and comforting, the potato and cauliflower curry had good-sized chunks of both vegetables, the chicken dish was creamy and savory, and everything went well with the rice and naan. By the way, I love how they make the naan here - it's not too thick, especially in the center, making the center slightly crispy and charred.Basically, I never get tired of coming here even though I've been here four times already, and it's for a good reason. Try Darbar at least once - you can really feel that their food is made with love and care, and I have gotten the seal of approval from some of my own friends of Indian descent, so I think it's safe to say that it's pretty legit!"

The kids hated forever the place. The parents were happy.  The restaurant has a nice owner. When he saw the kids suffering from the spicy food he brought for free another dish. When the kids were suggested to take a limonade-soda and they didn't like it, the owner accepted back the lemonade and didn't put it in the bill. And one more very important detail: if your liver and stomach are ok, try the spicy food and you'll feel very energized. Even the kids noticed it."

Beside that, the food was great. It was really tasty. But, in my opinion, it was really too expensive for what it was. You can find real good, authentic indian restaurants all over Montreal for a very few bucks. Beside that, the staff was weird, not that nice and judgy a bit. They were looking at us from there stool where the ""bar"" is all night long... For a one time experience that was fun, especially because I had a show after that at the Club Soda, it was not far from it. But I would never go back just to go and enjoy that restaurant.

The food was outstanding. We shared all our items with each other and I was simultaneously happy with what I ordered and also wishing I had what everyone else had. Weirdly at the end of the meal the server said we could not get desert as they needed the table to seat someone else for dinner, and splitting the check threw them off big time.

The man who served us who I assume was the owner was a very welcoming and funny man, he only added on to the already amazing food experience we had.The decor was pretty typical for an Indian restaurant and had that warm homey feeling on entrance. I liked how they offer two types of seating, one for eating on the floor with small tables and than your traditional tables and chairs. The food was absolutely killer, I've been to many Indian restaurants and this has set the new standard for me. We tried the thali, chicken pakora, samosa, lamb korma and of course naan. I need to say that the portions are great and each plate will just blow up with flavor once it touches your palate! I could go into more detail but I'll leave it for you to find out!There were some small hiccups throughout the night but they're not even worth mentioning since the overall service and food was just that good.I will definitely be returning to Darbar when I want my next indian fix!"

If you can handle medium spice but worry about getting too much food, then I suggest one of the tandoori dishes. The paneer naan was also slightly spicy but worked with my dish.

The lamb madras was also delish, but the portion is MUCH smaller for the same price as the Thali plate, without naan or rice. The decor is also adorable, and it's a super cute experience to eat cross legged on their cushions and carpet!

East Indian rice was advertised as having peas and raisins but it contained neither. Naan bread was okay. They have traditional seating (on the floor) which I thought was a cool concept so we opted for that. However, we were forgotten about.

The service here was also incredible - our table was constantly taken care of by 3 waitresses and even the chef! By far the friendliest, tastiest and best overall food experience I have had in Montreal - and that's saying a lot because I visit every summer.

We finished up by 9:15 and were chatting as we awaited for anyone to come over to ask if we were ready to pay our check. We weren't necessarily bothered by the lack of service or attention because we were in no rush. Meanwhile the entire kitchen staff of about 6 people is starting to exit and sit in the dining room staring at us but would look away if you made eye contact. Except for this one older guy who continued to stare at me without saying a word or smiling or gesturing in any manner while maintaining his gaze with me lol so I said ""Hi"" and he continued to stare for a few more moments without returning my greeting and then eventually looked away. The server finally came over and and took our empty desert plate and whispered shyly that they were closing as if she was slightly embarrassed to announce we had overstayed our welcome.

The food at darbar is the closest I've gotten in Montreal to the food my mom cooks back home. As I am a student on a budget, I find Darbar to be on the pricey side and can only come here on special occasions but the food really is great. I've tried the lamb saag and butter chicken with garlic naan, both of which I enjoyed but wished were spicier, the butter chicken especially as it had a lot of cream in it. One strange thing I've found out about Indian food in Montreal is that for most places, you have to order rice/naan on the side. Spending an extra 3-4 bucks on naan is super overpriced compared to the US, so be warned that any of the curry dishes along with naan will bring you to about a $20 meal. Overall, one of the better places I've eaten at in Montreal and also the owners are also really nice."

Both my friends and I each got a platter with a different kind of meat, of which I could not tell you my favourite. The butter chicken is always a good go too, as well as the aloo gobi and Darbar serves up the best naan bread I've ever experienced. The Mango 'yogurt' drink is also a fabulous option if your looking for something a bit sweet.The host was more than helpful and kind.

/user_details?userid=_Xm9qK8cMgoT4AcLSinMxg,Lauren I.,"Honolulu, HI",3 star rating,"The food was decent, but the portions were kind of small for the price. There were 5 of us, but there was barely 1 cube/piece of meat per person and sometimes there wasn't enough. It might have been because they were extra busy due to a jazz festival going on nearby, but it was disappointing. Naan was delicious though.They also kept forgetting parts of our order. We had to remind them about our tandoori chicken order and our drink orders a couple times. They also brought us the wrong type of beer when they actually did serve us. My mom also didn't get the chai tea she ordered (and later reminded the waitress about) until after we paid and were about to leave...We had high expectations due to the good yelp reviews, but service aside, it was just ok."
/user_details?userid=hq3Q-e-J-80OwL62uDtfDg,Amrendra Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Centrally located and a very decent place for dinner. Please note that entry is closed by 2130 hours so plan accordingly. Would suggest that one should go with good 1 - 1.5 hours in hand to enjoy the full course meal. We had ordered one vegetarian and one chicken Thali. Thali offers a combination of different dishes. It takes some time for it to be served but trust me its worth the wait.  Loved the taste of each vegetable and chicken dish as it was authentically Indian style cooked food in true sense. Owner of this place is very courteous and customer friendly. He personally talks to each customer to check feedback about the food. Highly recommended. Bon appetite

The only downside is that, if it's busy, you might be rushed by the staff. I was here with two friends whom I hadn't seen in a long time and we really wanted to enjoy a good meal and catch up. We were continuously interrupted throughout dinner and then when we chose to enjoy our wine instead of ordering dessert we were asked to pay the bill because they needed the table. We were not too impressed by that."

We were not disappointed-- the place was small and cozy with low light and soft music. We ordered onion bhaji to start, then got a lamb korma and a chicken curry, and onion naan on the side. Our waitress was great, made recommendations based on our requests, and was friendly without being invasive. B got a beer and I got a glass of the chardonnay, which was way too oaky for my taste; probably should have stuck with a lychee martini. They only have one white and one red wine by the glass, which is probably my only critique of the place, that a more robust wine list might make it a more attractive date night option for couples. But the food was so damn good, and as with most Indian food, the leftovers were just as great reheated the next day."

Wanted to lick the bowls but I do have manners. Onion naan was thick and infused with yummy spices and soft sweet onions. Luckily we sat out back where it was cool. Atmosphere inside was exactly what we would want to have in someone's Indian home but way to warm for us when I melt at any thing over 85.  Live musicStaff was welcoming and attentive.

We were a party of two, ordered 2dishes(Sananda and tiki Marsala). Our waitress had to come out 3 times to confirm our order as she had forgotten it. Then the chef/manager comes stomping out of kitchen with a ticket asking us if we want rice or naan, which we had already told the waitress 3 times. He either could not understand when we said rice or who knows because he just kept repeating rice or naan. I ask for rice and my wife asks for naan. Our food comes out, one of the dishes is completely wrong(we ordered tiki Marsala not a whole tandoori chicken and we have no rice with the other. After I point out our order was incorrect she didn't offer to fix or even apologize, just stood there asking if I wanted more rice(which is funny because I didn't have any to add more to). Manager chef comes out and to check to see if food was too spicy(no idea where this came from), told him it was not even spicy at all, he nodded and said good. Food quality/taste was barely at the level of frozen pre made dishes from the grocery store. I would stay away"

Well, one thing he was sure of was that he expected a tip (which I included before noticing that the napkins and utensils were missing from the order.The food was good.

I had hot chai, which was a little thin and bland. The rasmali was excellent. The restaurant is located downtown and parking even on a Thursday night was a little sporty. They don't take credit cards for less than $20, which is reasonable but a little inconvenient for business travelers dining alone -- I should have doubled done on dessert!"

We were here twice and the prototypicalCurries, kormas, and vindaloos were all very good.The place is small with few tables and there are a couple of places to eat sitting on the floor, if you wish. Darbar has a nice ambience but can get crowded easily. Its family owned and operated and the proprietors are as nice as can be which is  something rare these days in this increasingly anonymous restaurant world. The price points are good but not cheap. If you are in the area its certainly better than going up to the curry joints on Jean Talon for cheaper,but, not as refined indian food."

If you do not really eat Indian food the thali is the way to go. You get a bit of everything on a plate to taste and see. Plus price wise it was really affordable way under what we were expecting.

Madras was really spicy but still delicious.  The garlic naan was superb.  Everything was reasonably priced.We also got beer... There were two options ""en fut,"" the blonde ""taj mahal"" and the rouge ""cobra.""

The Tandoori fish and chicken tikka were cooked to perfection and was delicious! The chole tasted so fresh and clean. The batura was phenomenal and unlike any I have ever had. This place was so good we came back the next day. We ordered the chicken pakora, madras chicken, paneer naan, and CHOLE BATURA AGAIN!!!! The madras chicken was phenomenal and perfect for spice lovers!!!Overall, highly recommend this place. Food does take a little bit of time, but then again, perfection can't be rushed!

She seemed irritated right off the bat to have to talk to me at all - like, sorry that giving you business is an inconvenience for you (?!). She tells me it's impossible to place an order without the postal code. I point out it's been fine two other times, it hasn't been a problem before, and I don't know it. It's on a major street, very near to them - not even like its obscure or anything. She virtually YELLS at me that it's IMPOSSIBLE to place an order without it and HANGS UP on me.Floored.

Lastly,The dessert. My only regret is not trying the dessert we were so full by the time this came around. But for sure next time I am in Montreal I will stop by make sure to try some.All in all best, Indian food i have ever had. Hands down."

Fortunately, our server did a great job guiding us in our order. It was nice to be in a group (6) so we could try many things. If you are in a small party or don't want to share, try one of the plates at the beginning of the menu. They come with a bunch of awesome side dishes. All our food was fresh and flavorful. Even my aunt, who rarely finishes a meal, cleaned her plate."

I got to see all the action of the waitresses and waiters, and the chatter and busy buzzing of the place was what made it fun. I saw some people sit on the floor to eat so that was pretty cool! All in all for the price, my Thali plate was excellent and the service was attentive."

(Cash only.) I had to send another text to relay the message that they didn't deliver two items.  They didn't text back, call back or deliver the rest.  I'm still frustrated that my kids didn't get their dessert.  Sorry, but I won't be ordering from here again.  Always check your delivery orders."

The portion size was good and the flavors outstanding --plenty of depth and complexity. For something different, try the chai martini. The service was attentive and friendly. The space is quaint, seating maybe 25-30 inside. So if they accept reservations, I would recommend making one in advance."

I thought the price was super reasonable. Naan was awesome, but the rest was just ok. I've had better Indian food elsewhere, so wouldn't go back. Also, if you order anything on a sizzling plate (Chicken Tikka for example) - DO NOT TOUCH IT!

Often times you go to a restaurant and there are one or two dishes that stand out - but at Darbar, every dish was superb. I love Indian food and while I've never been to India, I have been lucky enough to have great Indian meals in London, Glasgow and Toronto. Darbar was without a doubt one of if not the best Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life. The staff were lovely and so friendly as well - I would return again in a heartbeat."

Channa was good and medium spicy was just right.  Curry chicken was good too. Service is slow and rice costs extra. I've never heard of rice being extra and it was not a lot and not great. Mango lassi was unusually thin and weak. Having eaten at probably a hundred Indian restaurants throughout the Eastern US and UK, it was a solid good on food, but not worth the money- $75 for 3 people."

What I didn't like was that almost all Indian restaurants let you choose rice or naan bread with your entree but here the dish came with rice and I had to order naan bread separate. This would've still been ok but when I got home there was no rice with my entree!!! They charged me extra for the naan bread and then skipped on the rice!!

So we end up ordering thalis and they were good and the service was good too and the restaurant ambiance was nice.  Though not necessarily what I would pay $18.00. Had the right menu prices been on the window, this review could've been more positve. Also they use those frozen jeweled vegetables in the curry and the tandoori chicken was very good."

I had a lamb curry with rice. The lamb curry was very tasty with nice, bold flavors. The only complaint I have is that I wished I had more. Knowing this, I think next time I will order a main dish with a Thali instead. I also tasted some of my friend's butter chicken with naan. Once again, very flavorful, and their naan works so well with it. A bit pricey, but will make you wanting for more."

/user_details?userid=SIfJWQKUPsNHVadyLu3Tyw,Beaudry C.,"Washington, DC",1 star rating,"Let me start by saying the food was pretty good and the pricing was too. The reason I am giving a 1 star is it was a bad dining experience for us. We arrived around 8 pm or so on a Saturday night and we did not have a reservation as we had arrived in Canada just then on our first visit. The restaurant was packed but the staff never even acknowledged that there were few customers waiting to be seated. They just kept going about their business. The place is tiny and there isn't much room even to stand and wait. After waiting for 20 mins, the owner's wife seated us in a table and after a few mins asked us to get up and vacate the table so that another customer who apparently had the reservation could sit. She made us sit at the bar which btw is right next to the toilet. In all these years, I have never been asked to give up my table after being seated so they can seat some other customer. When we told her how that was not nice, she argued with us and she was pretty rude. We were starving and didn't want to take it to go or find another restaurant and so sat there and ate. The owner seemed like a nice person and the two other staff members seemed nice too. We noticed two other customers who had made a reservation were told they had no reservation by the same rude owner's wife. So in summary, this place is good for take out because the food is quite good. It's a bad place for dining in since its tiny(cramped seating, too close to the toilet) and the staff is extremely disorganized with seating and reservation. Serviced was fine, food was arriving from the kitchen at good pace."

The Seekh Kabob appetizer is superb. The Butter Chicken sauce is delightful. I am not an epicure just someone who knows what they like and I like this restaurant. Great service and friendly service in the family run place. Parking is easy to find even during festival season. If you enjoy Indian food then you must give them a taste. I have visited them three times already this year.
/user_details?userid=ge2di3XG9nWt4BPANIUSPw,T S.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I'd give the food a 5/5. Maybe even a 6/5. We ordered onion bhaji and samosas to start and both were fantastic. Perfectly spiced. For the entrée we did madras lamb, tandoori chicken, aloo saag and chicken kashmiri. All 4 were equally amazing. The tandoori chicken was incredibly juicy which is rare with tandoori. Their naan was perfectly fluffy and chewy at the same time. However, I removed a star for several reasons-the servers, although very friendly, were forgetful and took a long time to bring basics to the table throughout the meal. Additionally, we received tap water instead of bottled and aloo saag instead of saag paneer. My final complaint was with the drinks. The two cocktails we ordered were served warm: in my case I ordered a chai martini and it came not just lukewarm but practically hot even though it was supposed to be chilled. We also were served wine in metal glasses and the metallic taste was overpowering. That being said, the food was so unbelievable I would happily return. The decor was beautiful as well-3 or 4 of the tables are traditional and have pillows and platters instead of a table and chairs. Oh, and one last thing is that despite the description listed on Yelp they do have outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend."
