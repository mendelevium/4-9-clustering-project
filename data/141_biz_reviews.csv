/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Updating to 5! Love this place. Fave is eggplant and avo sandwich. The cookies (Vietnamese coffee & chocolate, pb&j, milk choc) are to die for. Great neighbourhood snack I eat here at least once a month! Love it."
/user_details?userid=MQg4uzwvNSGRXl2K7mmzow,Elvi R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Found out about this place through my sister. Cute little spot right next door to the best bagels in Montreal, St-Viateur duh! I called before going to make sure that they had vegan options, and they did. This made me so happy as I haven't had a good banh mi since becoming vegan 3 years ago. They have 3 vegan options for their sandwiches: spicy eggplant, tofu chermoula and avocado pâté. My favourites were the tofu chermoula and the spicy eggplant. So flavourful and the bread is so fresh and crispy. AMAZING! Was surprised to see that the tofu is actually bean curd, it works so well marinated with all those yummy flavours and I found it to taste like curry a little. So if you don't like curry, I wouldn't recommend it. Every time I went I also grabbed a soba salad, really nice and refreshing especially during 40° weather. I guess you can tell by now that I really enjoy this place and recommend it. I wish they had a location in Vancouver."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of my regular spots! It is one of the better banh mi shops in town, and for $7 it is a decent deal. I do love it but there could be many improvements. My favorite sandwich is the char siu, as the chicken is flavorful and not dry. However I find that they use a bit too much dressing and mayo. This combined with the fact that the bread is not toasted makes it a bit soggy and texturally weird if you take out. I prefer banh mi that is that has a crunchier texture form the bread and veggies. You might wonder why I'm giving this place a higher rating if I'm not a huge fan of the banh mi, and that's because of the noodle salads. The soba and japchae are my favorite, and I get it regularly for lunch. They taste refreshing, light and make the perfect lunch. You can also add meat for a bit extra, and it is reasonably priced. I highly reccomend the noodle salads!"
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",3 star rating,"Dropped in on a Monday at around 11 to pick up some sammies for the drive back to NYC. We had the char siu chicken and the pork bánh mis. They were pretty good, which a good amount of meat in them. The pork was a little salty, and then end part was almost like jerky, so I would recommend the char siu chicken. By the way, this is just char siu-flavored chicken. We were confused about what it actually was until we bit into it. We ended up eating this one the next day after re-toasted it, and it was still pretty good. Not the best bánh mi out there, but it will do if you have a craving!"

/user_details?userid=M5zKbubjXGu6IPST6F-MfA,Justin M.,"Centretown, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is the shiznit. I must thank it for introducing me to the wonderful world of banh mi, into which I have lost myself for several years (what did Nietzche say about the abyss?). My roommate and I used to grab these for lunch then come home to eat them where no one could see us turn into beasts. I swear by the end of the first summer that this place was in business our kitchen drawer was filled with around 80 rubber bands. Delicious times...Great flavour, great service, awesome, talented and friendly employees, great price. The menu is short and sweet, and I love it all but I have to lean toward the pork sandwich as my all-star. Grab a cookie once you're done your sandwich and then grab another sandwich to go."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this place! The atmosphere is so chill and the food sososo delicious. First time I came in I got a lemonade and it was life changing. Minty and lemony goodness. Second time around I went with my boyfriend to try the Banh mi and they were fantastic. Fresh ingredients and yummy flavour combinations. I got the avocado and my boyfriend got the chicken satay extra spicy. He did say it wasn't spicy enough so if you love spicy make sure to ask and get it extra extra spicy. I loved my avocado sandwich, it did have a little bit too much bread but that's just the style so can't really complain about that. The avocado was fresh and the seasoning was perfect. The staff is really friendly, they made me feel right at home. They also have a killer selection of imported snacks, I went crazy and bought almost everything.I'm so happy they're close to my house because now I can go all the timeeeeeeeeee.Seriously, check this place out."
/user_details?userid=KSEz24G-vreWsB5t5ZFOdg,Jefferson S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",5 star rating,"One of the best Banh Mi I've ever had.And I've had a few.The bread is ridiculously fresh and chewy. Perfect consistency.Tried both the pork and chicken, and both were equally delish.Prices are fan-friendly: Seven bucks for a fatty banh mi.Unless you are dying for a bagel, skip it, and go next door for a tasty banh mi and you'll forget all the fuss about those sesame bagels!Yum! I'm ready for another..."
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING bang for your buck. SIX dollars for a huge homemade sub. Yes.Few sandwich choices, and some noodle options. I can only speak to the sandwiches (banh mi).The line gets a bit long at lunch, but the team is efficient and you'll be in and out within 10 mins.You can eat in on their bar, or take to go. They'll wrap up your sandwich up in some deli paper and a fun color rubber band.The bread is FRESH as. I always always get the avocado sandwich, but my friends love the satay! You could even ask them to add avocado to your satay if you're feeling fancy. You can pick your level of spice. I personally put none, and still find the sandwich to be well seasoned. They will load up a lot of coriander on your sandwich (literally, they just pop a few sprigs on in there...), so if you're not feeling coriander, then I'd get them to leave it out."
/user_details?userid=XaU5MAGxapGsgqSu1Put_A,Felipe M.,"Sydney, Canada",4 star rating,New restaurant in the area. Great spot for banh mi. Great service and quality. We were greatly received with a smile and some cake. The bread is amazing and the soup was delicious. A must if you're in the Mile End.
/user_details?userid=7u8Q7oSoDyWxl3gEOd-iRA,Lee C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really great sandwiches! Simple but tasty. The spicy option is very spicy btw! The interior is nothing fancy, but it still makes a pretty nice place to eat a quick meal. Friendly staff too."
/user_details?userid=2vKPIXEFrtqZc8zIWvA4tw,MaryJane R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place delivers on what it advertises - good food at a good price. I got the house salad + satay chicken and a bbq chicken sandwich all for $15 (including tax). I'm not a Bahn Mi expert, but both were extremely tasty. It's kind of crazy that just a few stores down, Vertu is selling salads at more than twice the price! The counter top bar is a really cute and hipster way to wait for your meal as they prep it for you :) Looking forward to coming here more often on my way back from the YMCA."
/user_details?userid=TyGofzrd3V_bojfhHsXbLQ,Julia W.,"Princeton, NJ",5 star rating,"Really love this place. The store is adorable. Staff is so friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is definitely chill. The Bahn Mi is very good, bursting of flavor. Love that we found this gem in town"
/user_details?userid=VOEaD5-QOff6HBtfA7T_rg,Alex H.,"Granada Hills, CA",5 star rating,"Poulet satay banh mi and soba/japchae with tofu skins. Great chewy bread with a little bit of crunch. Usually, banh mi bread is terrifying - I'm not a fan of the banh mi bread that rakes off a layer of the inside of my mouth. This bread was delicious and very inviting. The flavors were all there for the meat and veggies. The surprise was the soba/japchae - it was packed with so much flavor, nice kick of spice and they made me want another bowl immediately. Soy beans, cucumber slices, carrots, etc, the tofu skin.... all the spices and the noodlessssss. Coming back after sound check tonight."
/user_details?userid=2Vghk7w3PLUgfXJb42lPvQ,Ylani B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was very excited to see a banh mi place opening in the mile end. The decor and marketing seemed on point.but I was so disapointed to find that their ""banh mi"" was not authentic,did not have any vietnamese flavor and actually wasn't any good at all. Everything from the bread,toppings and sauce was just really off. I also find their whole direction confusing. Banh mi served with satay(why not grilled vietnamese-style instead)?Avocado and eggplant(eggplants in banh mi is just so wrong)?Korean japchae salad(which was so goopy and bland)?and chocolate cookies?even the staff appears confused and not so friendly.if only they had focused on making their banh mi right. My advice is please save your money and go to the real banh mi places like hung phat,hoang oanh or vua.for 7$ you can get 2 real banh mi there instead.I am sorry for leaving a disapointing review,i really had hopes this place would be good.2stars for the decor and location."
/user_details?userid=NUurlZND8i6BXh989CMlzQ,Ashley B.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,We stopped in here randomly because we needed to find food for my hangry husband on our way to the bus stop. I stole a bite of his sandwich (I had already eaten) and it was fantastic. The herbs gave the sandwich such a fresh flavor and the bread was really great. I was a little jealous I didn't order one for myself.
/user_details?userid=voh_J8c3BG228n8HjaZCBQ,Melissa C.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Best sandwiches and daily soups. I love coming here for a quick bite. The avocado banh mi and sweet potato coconut ginger soup are my favourites. The food is always fresh and delicious. Bread is always freshly made from the morning. The resto decor is so true to the area! If your visiting or a local, you need to try this place!"
/user_details?userid=0lIW9-Jx68gpuRMSe9kxYQ,Mike L.,"Suffolk, MA",5 star rating,"Love this place...good food, fast and friendly! Had the sandwich with chicken and char siu, which was excellent."
/user_details?userid=5eiydp7RgLgJZtZjXrNVYA,S L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This banh mi spot is by far my favourite in the city. Their eggplant and tofu sandwiches are unreal - a HUGE portion packed with flavour, fresh herbs and seasoning and so cheap! The sandwiches can be made vegan if you ask that the mayonnaise be eliminated. My only complaint is that instead of replacing the mayonnaise with avocado for free, they charge 2$. I opt out and put my own vegan mayonnaise on the sandwich at home ;)"
/user_details?userid=v7HHgo-8rgkohGEYAbSBZw,Matt G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,The avocado bahn mi is genuinely one of the finest sandwiches I've ever eaten. My wife and I can't stop thinking about it. We will definitely be back again and again and again!
/user_details?userid=P7M4vx9rz4L6BxgJgws1MA,Miguel S.,"Fresno, CA",4 star rating,"Food was delicious, particularly the bread, which is key to any Banh Mi. Met the owner, he is of Moroccan background which he represents well in his menu."
/user_details?userid=rT52d2uiFqj7ggZ-9u7GOw,Karine D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,So far we tried the chicken satay and the tofu sandwiches. Both very tasty. Bread is very fresh too. Great addition to the neighborhood!

/user_details?userid=Hzs64iJjyG2GJMBK83Rq3g,Kaitlin W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cute and colourful restaurant! Perfect for when you want a healthy and fresh meal on the go...not to mention very reasonably priced!! The salads are light and tasty, the soups change everyday and the banh-mì are made on a deliciously light and crunchy bread!! A must try!! (Grab a cookie on the way out !!)"
/user_details?userid=kuksFR1R8gCUvvhcSWMpjw,Mark H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Great setting and refreshing fresh food. Perfect music and friendly staff who are actually interested in what they're doing. The small menu is just right. The only drawback is sandwiches aren't toasted, but that's a minor complaint when everything else is so great."
/user_details?userid=uN-R8j0JexLz2AEBYOByIA,Nico L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not your typical banh mi but I really enjoyed mine! We ordered the chicken char siu and braised pork banh mi's. For $6, you get a generous and filling sandwich. Good meat to veggie ratio and the bread soaked up all the sauces, making it nice and soft. They also had a nice variety of Asian candies, cookies, chips and drinks in store. Friendly, laid back service. My only criticism would be with regards to the ca phe (Vietnamese iced coffee). I found it was FAR from what a ca phe is - not strong enough, thick enough and sweet enough. It was a little on the filtered and diluted side for me."
/user_details?userid=SloqOZfa6FO7PUjbx_L6OA,Lauren W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious bahn mi the size of my face for $7!  Retro, diner-style counter seating decor!  Friendly local owner and employees!  Scrumptious peanut-butter and jelly cookie!  What more could I want for lunch?  As a neighborhood local, I just wish they were open for dinner / late night snacks too!"
