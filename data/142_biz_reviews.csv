Tortas are street food staples in Mexico. They're somewhere between a sandwich and a taco. Looking at their menu I had a hard time deciding which one to try first as they all sounded delicious. I decided to have their torta La Nopalito and it was so flavourful. I will be going back as I'm determined to try them all

They make vegan Mexican sandwiches and they are AMAZING! My first time was on Saturday and my second time was on Sunday, the next day XDFirst off, the space is so frigging cute! Second, the staff is so nice and helpful. Then there's the food.... So flavorful and full of different textures, not what people would think of for vegan food. I tried the Al Pastor, the Llorona and the Mushroom Sonora. As both times were take-outs, I was super impressed with how crispy the bread and the sweet potato fries stayed! It's a definite YES GO AND TRY IT! They've been opened for 3 weeks (the same peeps as Momo sushi) and I'm so glad I stopped in because I will be back!"
