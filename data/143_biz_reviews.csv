I decided to walk to St Laurent St and have a little side  walk picnic with take out food. So many choices, Schwartz's , The Main and Portuguese chicken which is Coco Rico. All next door neighbours plus a bonus, Bill Bouquet ice cream to seal the deal on a hot scorching day. You can smell the food oozing in the air from this Rotisserie  as you walk by so I entered. Prices are really reasonable! I had a chicken dinner plate which included fries, salad and choice of spices brushed on the chicken so i chose Spicy. They give a pretty big plate thinking I would never be able to finish it all but guess what? I ate all of it .This place has been around for ever and one can never go wrong to eat here. They have ribs as other choices that you can add to your chicken with side dishes. So much to choose and all very yummy! Off to Bill Bouquet for my orange chocolate ice cream in a cup...ouhhhhh!"

With such challenging times these days, it may be even more important to recognize this and give them the praise deserved. If you are wondering if or what I ate, I had a classic chicken sandwich, with a vinegar pickle and some wings and all were exemplary. It's really amazing how every day, you can count on there offerings to be spot on.Keep up the good work and hopefully for a long time to come. Plus, hopefully there will be CFL football to watch after grabbing a bite there in the near future. Thanks again for caring that quality and value mean a lot."

Yaaay !!! We decided to stop by before our way back home and pick up dinner for the house.We went with their Family Pack for 24.99$ It's a pretty great deal .. we got the full Portuguese Chicken came with a large salad , a large bag of fries when I say large it wasn't a small tiny Mcdonalds large it was a huge Mega xtra large ... and Portuguese tarts for Dessert  Service was awesome and pleasant we ordered and it was fresh and ready in 5min tops It was a huge line up but it moves insanely quick.The food: ok the chicken was not The best but it was super inexpensive and I definitely had to give it a try.. It wasn't the best Portuguese chicken I've had quite a bit dry but still good. The fries came in a massive bag a lil bitter to my liking but still smelled amazing and fresh! Salad was fresh but not much inside just mixed green lettuce and carrot julienne slices.Overall, if you're looking to fill your belly up quickly and you're on a budget this place is definitely worth to check out as we had a feast and still have some leftovers ... I definitely recommend this place !"

Parking is not happening. Service was helpful & Jacky loves it when the staff recommends their best. On the menu: Jacky had the ""Rotisserary"" chicken with fries & a pork sandwich. The chicken had a crispy outside & an oh so juicy inside! The pork was moist & the fries had a nice crunch & kick to them. It was all delish! Price is good; there's some bang for that cluck! The decor is dated but Jacky don't care & nor should you. Just go and ask for the bird.Follow @JackyEatsMTL"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Everyone has their favourite places in town for Portuguese chicken. We decided to give Coco Rico a shot after picking up some groceries. It's next door to Schwartz's. The menu is up behind the counter: roasted potato, roasted chicken, pork ribs, chicken wings, sandwiches, super plate specials and combos. - Spicy half chicken ($6.29) - we were making dinner at home so we grabbed half a chicken as our protein. Wasn't spicy at all but it sure was greasy. Meat was dry and overcooked. Sadly, this wasn't close to real Portuguese chicken.- 2x Natas ($1.50 each) - always need to try the natas. These weren't flaky or creamy. Instead, it was almost too sweet. Not up to par.Don't get how this place is so highly rated. Put the extra effort in and walk/BIXI to the other Portuguese places on rue Rachel. You'll be much more satisfied."
/user_details?userid=8HLcBhTyEDLDOeu45JSAfQ,Eddyc C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,We came here around 8:00pm for a quick dinner. I wanted the 1/4 chicken dinner with roasted potatoes.  They didn't have dark meat so I settled for white meat.  The chicken was good but this time it wasn't as good as I had it in the past.  Maybe the chicken spent a bit too much time under the heat lamp.  Although being a bit dry it was still good. The potatoes were good as always.
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We were in the area and wanted to have a quick light lunch. Coco Rico fit the bill. there was no crazy line up like there is outside of Schwartz so this is a great alternative if you're starving and don't want to wait in line next door.We ordered at the counter the 1/4 Chicken combo for only $8.95. Since we were two they simply took half a chicken and cut it in half and give each one of us the quarter...one of us got the breast the other one of us got the leg. So we have a choice of their little round potatoes or french fries. The little potatoes are nicely seasoned and tasty. The fries are on the greasy or side.They offer a small salad alongside the chicken. You can request for extra sauce on your chicken and it comes in a small little plastic container.The chicken is not as flavorful as Portuguese chicken from Romados but is acceptable especially for the price. It's also not as well roasted but again is still ok.There's not that much room in the restaurant so you sit along the counter on the opposite wall. This is more a quick bite/takeout place then a sit down and dine place.

Very quick service, and everyone is super nice which makes it so pleasant :) the inside is not that clean but for the price, you can't complain...Got the chicken sandwich and poutine (new addition to the menu!)! the chicken was dry, but the poutine was great. Starchy cajun fries swimming in artery clogging gravy topped with chewy cheese gold. The nata (egg tart) was a little stale but delicious nevertheless!"

It was better than the other place we still got food at! The portions were very good and the food was very fresh! We got a 1/4 chicken and rib plate with potatoes and Mac salad. Delish! The one plate was enough to fill me and husband up! I do recommend the potatoes. You can get fries anywhere ! Try it out! There was a constant line but they moved through the people quickly. highly recommend for visitors if you want something different and good!

I was a newbie to this place so I didn't realize you could customize the sandwich, it was still really good!Potatoes were ok and the macaroni salad was great!I love the way this place smells when you walk through the door. ughguhgu so heavenly.Get you order to go because you can eat outside when it's pretty and warm."
/user_details?userid=w9VSbG6bWPflax5_gwt6pg,Daniel A.,"Vaughan, Canada",1 star rating,"Don't know why this place is so highly rated...Between my friends and I, I had a chance to try their chicken and pork. Both meats were dry - the chicken was definitely not authentic portuguese, and the pork chop must have been sitting on a stove all day because the bottom of it had been completely blackened and the whole thing was as dry as leather.It's a shame because the potatoes were some of the best I've had!"
/user_details?userid=o6Q945IrTIJ7q-4UoRmC8A,Vivi G.,"Marpole, Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,Don't buy their Natas. I know they look great but actually taste HORRIBLE!! Like they add neither eggs nor creams. It just taste like flour mixed with sugar. Very very disappointed:((( And the chicken tast so so.
/user_details?userid=_hsruQCw6UTnjlQiuSpScg,Mike M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,I usually go here after making a stop at Schwartz.  I have eaten the chicken here and it's great but I usually just grab some natas as dessert after going to Schwartz since I'm pretty full.  These are some of the best natas I've had and I recommend coming here just for those.

/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a solid bet for Portuguese chicken.The chicken is similar to Romados, in the sense that it's moist but just a little tasteless as the flavour does not reach the inside of the chicken, but the skin and top layer is awesome.The star attraction here is the potatoes, melt in your mouth, tender warm and swimming in oil, nothing beats them. Romados offers a ton of fries so it's better value since Coco Rico gives about 8-10 potatoes.I normally buy extra potatoes and ask for spicy as they are worth the extra calories.The interior is very sparse, there is a counter along the wall and that's it.It's understandable that there are no formal tables as there are lineups most of the time and there's not much room."
/user_details?userid=XPAVy1ljAA9Tv98XvKnFug,Chris R.,"Schenectady, NY",5 star rating,Stopped in for the first time late night as they were about to close.  I picked up a spicy rotisserie chicken and a couple Portuguese tarts to bring back to the hotel.  It was a great meal and reasonably priced.  The staff was extremely friendly.  Overall it was a great experience and I highly recommend this restaurant.

Also the ratio of flavour:potato isn't great; they should probably cut them in half!"
/user_details?userid=aH-e0gtf7cLjqPpfC0C7Gg,Remi R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent chicken. They roast it to perfection. We always take out from them especially when we are in a hurry. I love also their chicken wings. I love them because they serve them crunchy. Their wedges potatoes are also very good.
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I ordered a half chicken with potatoes and pasta salad. The chicken breast was somewhat dry, just like St-Hubert chicken. It was poorly flavored and the skin was completely dried out. The spicy sauce did not taste much of anything.The chicken leg was moist, a tad tastier than the breast.The potatoes were a bit sweet, and I didn't find its combination with the hot sauce very pleasant. The pasta salad was greasy and tasted too much mayonnaise.The 40¢ bread was really dried out and salty, at least Romados gives them for free.As for the natas (egg tarts), the pastry was soggy... so I wouldn't recommend buying them. If I gave Romados a 4/5, I'm going to have to rate this lower."
/user_details?userid=kjzg7jTm6tWhETeJ3xDqZw,Andrew H.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Was walking on st Laurent street and felt the need for some Portuguese grub. Stumbled on Coco Rico. Never ate there although my in laws are Portuguese and we always go in that area for food. I was pleasantly impressed by the chicken. It is cooked on an open flame while rotating carefully to have every inch of it perfectly juicy. Their potatoes dipped in the spicy sauce is also quite good. Their salad is either coleslaw or garden salad with Italian dressing, that kind of disappointed me. Portuguese salad dressings are to die for, hopefully they'll get some in the future. You can finish off your dish with a nice Sumol. It's basically Portuguese orange crush but way better."

So we ordered the combo #2, which comes with the ribs and the chicken. We also got the macaroni salad and the slaw. All of it came out to be around $20 (which I think is pretty cheap given how much food we got)I really liked the chicken. It was flavourful and tender. The ribs were also pretty good as well! The only thing we regret was that we couldn't eat too much cuz of our dinner reservation"
/user_details?userid=vr-Rw3nMKIgGrVNT6A7p9g,Jamie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,Chicken and ribs were so good and cheap! (we even snuck  in some Schwartz's take out from next door for an insane meat fest without the crowds)
/user_details?userid=Z374Ok46YdkmWqa__9nAjA,Allie S.,"Cambridge, MA",4 star rating,We ran into this restaurant while exploring a festival on Saint-Laurent. The rotisserie chicken looked so good we decided to walk back to this establishment for dinner. We opted to have the non spicy version of the rotisserie chicken which was still very moist and flavorful. We ordered inside and then brought our food to the outdoor patio to do some people-watching as the festival was still ongoing. Overall a nice choice for an affordable ans tasty meal.

Before we even ordered we overheard some American tourists sitting next to us complaining about how unflavorful and dry the meat was. We ignored them and decided to order because we were starving! To our surprise, the chicken was very very dry...drier than the porkchop. Portion was very generous but everything tasted a bit off."
/user_details?userid=xX2yiK-5rZG7Aaaz9FfS8g,Melissa L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I had my very first Portuguese chicken sandwich at Coco Rico and really enjoyed it. The chicken was juicy and I had never eaten anything like it before. Although I asked for it spicy, I didn't taste much heat, however, it tasted delicious all the same. I personally like it best of the few I've had in the city. I came in just before 9pm on a Wednesday night so there was no line. The sandwich itself came to about $6. It might be a little small if you are feeling quite hungry though, so make sure to add the sides for a ""full"" meal!"
/user_details?userid=Ik43_5LKzdd5zmbsYRWyAw,christine j.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Montréal is full of excellent chicken. Coco Rico is rotisserie style and the dripping flavor the potatoes. It's been here forever and there is a reason why. Excellent flavorful chicken. Now they just started French fries which are up to my high standard. Make sure you get it spicy. They often have specials and portions are huge.
/user_details?userid=ehQKlrRRl_NSPoeN4rpRUg,Samantha S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down some of the best chicken in the city.The place itself isn't fancy but I promise that you will love the food! It's pretty much a counter for take out but you can stop and grab a bite as long as you're fewer than 6 or are going at an off-time. They have about 18 places total but most people are there for take-out anyway. I recommend the chicken (!) but also the ribs and if you ever get a chance the lamb (order only).I've been going here for years and honestly you'd be hard-pressed to find better rotisserie chicken. Not your typical portuguese, Coco Rico slow cooks their birds to deliver perfect chicken every single time. Staff is friendly and the place is generally clean. A great choice if you're looking for a healthy meal to bring home or a really just interested in enjoying great food without the added frills. I would recommend this place until the end of time."
/user_details?userid=MeJJ50cVS-ycShR5wBKtHg,Alex A.,"White Rock, Canada",5 star rating,"Is it just me or does the chicken sandwich trio taste better when ordered in the evening compared to the afternoon?My regular is the chicken sandwich trio consisting of an honest-to-God deliciously greasy chicken sandwich, potatoes, and a choice of salad (I always go with macaroni). This stuff is the stuff, if ya know what I mean. It's a nice change to have boiled/roasted (not sure which) potatoes instead of fries on the side like the usual. The potatoes are really good so that's a plus. I'm also a fan of the macaroni salad.. If you didn't get that already. The staff is also super nice so bonus points!"

So, I said okay for a small portion and weights it and told me it was 10.49. And she keep asking should I want to cut the ribs, at first I said no. But, she keep saying after she brush the BBQ sauce, I can't cut it anymore..so I said okay to cut the ribs. Guess what ? when I want to pay for  my food ..now she charges me at 12.99. I stead of 10.49.? I asked why? She said she has to charged me for to cut the ribs.. what it is now? She is a liar !! Don't go to that store!

/user_details?userid=VgoFAXExCm2l-57WZFPeJw,Nick Y.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,Ribs and chicken were both dry.  Possibly because they weren't served very warm.  Potatoes were tasty.  Won't be back.

Seriously.The rotisserie chicken here is amazing, the skin alone is super-crisp and the meat inside is juicy and not dried out at all. That's a sign of chicken-done-right. Make sure you ask for the spicy sauce to be brushed on as well.  I've brought friends from overseas here and they still rave about the chicken and the roasted baby potatoes.Ribs are so-so and I haven't tried their ham or roasted pork but the patrons I do see order those items always clean up their plates.The creamy coleslaw is also quite stellar. If you still have room, their egg custard tart desserts are also worth it!"
/user_details?userid=4Fn8B3ECp6-oqh7a8kOyjA,Stef M.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,If you are looking for quality authentic fast food this is as good as it gets. The flavours and textures of the meats are exceptionally good. I have had my share of chicken and ribs and this is very good. I make my own version of great ribs that I have to say rank about 8th best I've ever had. These are a close first. I'd say tied for first best I've ever had. I actually sat there and took a bite and looked back at the servers and looked around the place wondering how can they be so good out of a simple place. The chicken is equally done to perfection. Forget about swish chalet of others of that kind this is crispy skin tender meat full of savoury goodness.There is a famous smoked meat place near by that had a line up outside. I can't understand why you would wait in line when this spectacular food is just steps away. The staff is friendly in English and French. The prices are very fair. If I ran the place I'd try to get better seating. They could do a full service and I would go as often as I could. If you crave amazing flavour chicken and ribs you need to stop by and have a bite.
/user_details?userid=xhxMn4xIc49HnAXkVg4H2g,Andrew W.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,Great food and helpful staff. The only problem is that they only accept cash or debit card. It has to be a Canadian debit card (US won't work). There's an ATM in store but it cost $2.99 per transaction.

I opted for the non-spicy alternative. They also have cherry cola which is one of my favorites. A nice touch!Service is excellent. We were there a bit before 7 and there were continuous lines of people but everything was moving quick.

As a tired customer standing in line I decided to risk it! but it turned out to be a rather decent discovery.Like this place because it's simple and to the point - Delicious chicken with some wicked hot sauce over it and some boiled and bbqed potates (cooked alongside with the chicken) on the side makes a very filling and delectable meal.The chicken is really tender and moist and just melts in your mouth. Doesn't have too much space to sit but honestly I'd keep my focus on the chicken and do with it :p Totally worth it!Staff are very friendly and warm. Price is cheap (1/2 chicken for 5.99 +Tx is a steal deal)They do serve bbq'd ribs too but haven't tasted em. May be next time..def!

My gf got the mild sauce and I got the spicy sauce, the spicy sauce had a nice kick to it however the chicken did not have much flavour. The chicken was pretty moist and tender but not as good as Romados like others have mentioned. Got only a few potatoes which were soft and hot, once again not that much flavour with those as well. The macaroni/coleslaw salad was decent and my gf said the tart was good but did not taste fresh.Overall I give this place a 3.5/5, food was just okay and the same goes for the price."

/user_details?userid=tHzhZfXDYg7NiZGv2RvDDg,Melody S.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,The chicken was good. This is rotisserie chicken not cooked on a grill/fire. I would not considered this Portuguese chicken. I enjoyed the creamy coleslaw. Beware they charged 50 cents for an extra plate. Really?! Are they that hard up. Also the sitting is at a counter only. Takeout is prolly best.
/user_details?userid=0KuF3n51N0eiZnv2SS4wFw,Adam H.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,Had lunch here with a friend! We decided to get half a chicken with salad and potatoes. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the spicy sauce they add gives it a nice kick. The coleslaw was average and the potatoes were flavorful but did get a few that were not cooked all the way through. Was a bit perplexed when the woman behind the counter charged me 50 cents for an extra paper plate? Overall not a bad lunch if you are craving Portuguese chicken but i would still choose ramados given the choice.

Dried out inedible chicken breast, you can't call yourself a chicken rotisserie place if you can't cook a good chicken..When I went in with 4 plates of chicken, they wouldn't even change it.. All the lady said was""in all her time she has never seen chicken breast that wasn't dried out"" Her solution was to add sauce. If zero stars where possible, Coco Rico would get it for food and customer service."

AND - they are not ordinary potatoes!!!The chicken is really tender and flavorful. The potatoes are whole mini potatoes that were slowly roasted. The vinegar-slaw is also very good. To top it all off, get a Portuguese egg tart which is oh so creamy, rich, sweet, and yummy. Honestly, this place gives Schwartz a run for its money."

The unpleasant rude girl is gone, probably for a long time, and has been replaced by another one with shaven head, a few tattoos here and there and a very friendly and courteous attitude. I bought a pork roast sandwich, potatoes and pork ribs to go and the food was very good, the pork was juicy and the ribs were crispy outside and tender inside. I ordered a slaw that looked curiously and overly green (I wonder if it glows in the dark, maybe the cabbages were imported from Fukushima) and did not taste natural, so I am staying away from it. I am updating my review and giving it two more stars because I am fair with my ratings and they deserve them....and yes, I will be coming back"

The chicken is moist and savoury and you want them to pour the hot sauce all over the chicken, the sandwich, the potatoes, everything, directly in my mouth if possible. There is little to no room to eat in here, but there are an awful lot of perfectly cute little potatoes roasting, and chickens just waiting for you to take them out on a date, to the park, heck take them straight home where yall can be alone..."

The crispy chicken with the spicy sauce in the middle of that soft roll are just heavenly. We don't always get the side potatoes, but they are delicious as well. I'm a fan of the creamy cole slaw; my husband likes the macaroni salad. I got one of their natas (the custard cakes) this last visit, too, and they are just as good as the originals I had in Portugal. On top of the good food, the service is fast and friendly. It's a teeny bit pricey for what it is, but still very reasonable. Skip Schwartz (over hyped!) and come here instead. I really wish they'd open one in NYC!"

Being from Southeastern Massachusetts and Portuguese myself I am sort of a connoisseur when it comes to Portuguese popsecos. I also got the potatoes and a queijada de nata(custard cup). The meal was delicious and very reasonably priced.If I am ever in Montreal again I will make sure I stop by Coco Rico and get me some chicken."
/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When you walk along St Laurent, or even St Dominique, and get to Napoleon street, you will get a whiff of something in the air,  The smell is of chicken, but not just any chicken COCO RICO chicken.  It has a sweetness to it and your mouth starts to water because you know your in for a great mouth full.  The crispy skin, browned just so, covering the juiciest pieces of chicken, that will fall of the bone and into your mouth, like a sacrificial virgin into a volcano, only willingly.   I only do the chicken (OK maybe some macaroni salad once in a while), and a Portuguese bun.  But the pork is also good for a taste, but a little on the pricey side, potatoes have never done it for me either they look good but then meh! you get a better deal with the whole chicken, don't even bother getting less. Even if it is just for one, take it home you wont regret it and probably make friends as well.  Having tried several Portuguese chicken places I still say this one has it's own unique flavor and texture, and it's fast and easy to get so if your wandering along on St Laurent and you get the COCO breeze, walk  in and indulge.Tip try this chicken with piri piri sauce, which can be bought in most grocery stores."

Coco Rico is one of the best places in the city for chicken!I went in for a quick Chicken Sandwich before watching a football match in Champs across the road, and I was surprised by the awesomeness of the chicken here. You can smell the juiciness and tastiness of the chicken when you walk in, and the taste is no less amazing. They cut the meat from the chicken right in front of you, and they are FAST when they do it. These guys are good with knifes. By the way, don't expect super service as it's an authentic, ethnic store."

The buying process here was quick and easy - a half chicken, potatoes and coleslaw is a perfect serving size for two moderately hungry individuals. I liked the gently-paprika seasoned mini potatoes. The mayo slaw was a little too creamy for my liking; I was hoping it might quench my thirst from the savory and greasy chicken. The skin on the roasted chicken was very delectable. I wouldn't have eaten a lesser roasted chicken skin."

There are also portuguese buns, a sign for corn bread, which was absent, and egg tarts. The chicken was good, I got it with spices but couldn't really taste the difference, the ribs, also good - the potatoes looked amazing but didn't really taste of much.  Very, very filling, and very reasonably priced. I'm interested in trying their sister restaurent, which is actually a sit down place rather than a take out shop."
/user_details?userid=NLJT8SQ1f0YpxO4hFUPdrw,Emilie B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I've been dying to try the famous Portuguese chicken and on this particular night, after a long day at work, I just didn't feel like cooking at all, yet without spending $20 on dinner. I gave Coco Rico a try. I didn't eat at the restaurant since I live a few blocks from there. However, I noticed that the restaurant is very small and I don't think it is the best place to eat in. Ideally, order as take-out. I had the chicken thigh and it was great. Nothing I hate more than dry chicken and it was not the case here. It was juicy and yet not fatty. Ask for plenty of napkins because it can get really messy and be careful if you wear nice clothes. You MUST ask for extra spicy sauce with it. It adds a little something to your meal. The potatoes are really worth trying. The coleslaw was... coleslaw. Better than St-Hubert's for sure. Price - and that was the biggest surprise: $8 (with taxes) for a chicken thigh, potatoes and salad. I couldn't believe that I had a full meal for under $8; I don't think I have seen this very often in Montreal. Maravilhoso!Conclusion: Will definitely go back, probably once a week. P.-S. If you standing in line to get in a certain deli restaurant and you get right next to Coco Rico, just go in. It is worth it."
/user_details?userid=S9ERL8VSyLB9SIIsVDcfhw,Tian X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A late review but the experience still saved in my mind. That speaks almost everything.I don't want to compare Coco Rico with Romados, yet they are very close by geographical distance. However personally, Portuguese Chicken tastes more juicy than Poulet rôti Québecois by average.I ordered 2 slices of ribs and 1/4 chicken combo, that came with the famous potatoes. Ribs were a surprise coz it beyonded my expect, their homemade sauce was ideal mate for the ribs. Chicken was exactly what I thought, typical Portuguese flavor. Slightly less interesting maybe because I didn't order the hot sauce. Potatoes were lying on oils, not cooked on perfect time, inside was a bit tough but still tasteful, which i could not complaint, have to say. Above the foods, those guys and girls are very friendly and pleasant.A huge plus was after the horrible experience in Kazu and cold fresh oysters in Maestro SVP, I did need that hot, tasty, juicy chicken and ribs for the damn snowing freezing winter night.As some other reviews said, I do think that Coco Rico should have reached a higher success if they decide to move to somewhere else in Montreal. Romados and Jano are too strong to set the price range down. And Schwartz's is not a good companion for sure. Coco Rico deserves a better place and a further improvement.The Goods:The unfamous ribs! The outstanding smell. The above average quality of pre-cooked food.Not good not bad: Selections are limited. Maybe it's the stra of the restaurant but it's more suitable for take out not dine in. Chicken is there, not far but still distance from perfect.The cons: Bar stools are the places only offer if you want to dine in. And half of them suffer the cold wind if someone enters and leaves. You can not even find a place to hang on your winter coat."

It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.Finish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)Romado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados...

It's a divey joint with limited seating which equates to bang for your buck.  A quick (assuming there is no line) delicious feast between shopping. My favourite part is the potatoes - they fill the bottom of their rotisseries with these carby nuggets and let the juice and fat from the meat drip all over them. Oh soooo dirty. I had the pork ribs with a side of macaroni salad and coleslaw. My friend had the chicken. You can't eat this a lot. But when I do, the added poundage on my butt is nothing compared to a happy tummy.P.S. I heart their egg tarts."

It's definitely the most convenient alternative when the Schwartz' lineup is around the block. The fried potatoes are those really super hearty little ones that blow anything I've had outside of QC out of the water. I'm unsure how I feel about the spice blend they shake on when you ask for it hot; it's certainly spicy, but it's so salty that it reminds me suspiciously of Dorito seasoning. Make sure you get a lot of whatever fatty deliciousness they apply to your food with that oil-soaked paintbrush, though, and get a few natas for dessert. Also, you are strongly encouraged to eat in, especially in the cold; their food gets to you at just about the minimum acceptable temperature, and the flavour really doesn't hold up when it gets any cooler."
