We came here exactly at 11 am for opening time because we were going to try an ambitious 3 new poutine places that day. Spoilers: This was the only one we went to.We ordered a small Sloppy Joe Poutine and a small Breakfast #3 Poutine. The Breakfast poutine was okay---- but the sloppy joe poutine is where it's at. Guys. The sloppy joe poutine was thick, ooey gooey, meaty, super savoury, cheesy, the fries were crisp for the first 3 minutes, and then it all just melts into a mountain of deliciousness. This is it. This the best poutine I had up to this point. It was so easy to eat because it was so saucy. Delicious.You need to try this place. They have lots of other flavours/options too--- a lot of them are super novel sounding like Butter Chicken Poutine and General Tao Chicken Poutine . Free pop if you check in too! (We didn't use it because we were the first ones in there and didn't wanna be jerks)We were so full and itis'd after eating here we just went back to our hotel until night time. Worth it."
/user_details?userid=mWcS4rFDDJOVMVuER-Cqzw,Emily P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"We were under substantial pressure from friends and family to try Poutine when we were in Montréal. Our Airbnb host recommended a few good spots, but Poutine Centrale was only a few minutes away from our apartment. We arrived around 9:30PM, and thankfully the place was pretty empty. We had no trouble ordering our food and drinks. We ordered a regular poutine and a smoked meat one with a Boreale Red beer. I was happy to be able to try a Canadian-brewed beer. It was sweet and malty and accurately red as the menu described it. Then we tried the poutine which was piping hot when it was brought to us. It was definitely good. The gravy and fries and cheese curds mixed well together. The smoked meat was a nice added touch. Although it wasn't too comfortable to eat steaming Poutine in a warm restaurant, I still enjoyed it very much. It didn't blow me away though as some other people said it would. It seems like it would be excellent drunk/hangover food for sure. I may return if I come back to Montréal."
/user_details?userid=MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",5 star rating,"While having lunch here, we actually got into an argument, on ""other social media,"" with other American and Canadian friends about whether their Italian Poutine is actually poutine (can you imagine Americans being purists about poutine?). That conversation was silenced with a reply of ""And how is YOUR authentic Quebecois poutine lunch today?"" Ca y est, this is the real thing (if you want to be the purist in the bunch, order the classic smoked meat version), with more than a dozen varieties from which to choose, and way too many good aromas as you walk in. During the busier part of lunch, it gets crowded, and it can take a few minutes for your order to be made, but that proves they're making the fries fresh. Beverage options are 3 types of beers and several options for soda (and I learned the French for Root Beer). Seating options are a couple of larger tables in the center, and table space along the walls, all with ""log"" type seats. It's not the most comfortable option, but that's not the part of your body you're trying to satisfy when you visit here. Poutine Centrale is a medium walk away from Olympic Parc and a nice option for dining if you're in that area."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A solid place if you are craving poutine with small twists. Located in Hochelaga, it is rather inconvenient to access it. However, the detour is worth it if you are actually looking for a quality poutine.Their menu is very varied with different types of poutine as you can see on pictures uploaded by other yelpers. I personally settled on the General Tao poutine, which was surprisingly well orchestrated. The mix of flavours blended well, with the thick gravy contracting well with the sweet and sour texture of the chicken sauce. I also took the pogo, which was good, but nothing mindblowing.Would definitely come back to try their other types of poutine!"
/user_details?userid=8kBm0sJLxJD7Cj5MZsRhFQ,Ha D.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"They have French menu but you can ask for an English menu. They have many poutine options for you. I chose the Montreal smoked beef, and Buffalo wings ones. The sauce is well seasoned. The portion is good for the price. The price ranges from 10-20. The place is good for family, or group. The interior design is minimalism. If you check in, you can get a free soft drink as of July 2019. It is easily accessible by public transportation. There are also plenty of street parking nearby."
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"Poutine Centrale is in a neighborhood close to the Olympic Park area. Food: Poutine served with a variety of toppings along with a few other dishes to round up their menu. I had the regular poutine - deep fried fresh cut potatoes topped with cheese curds and gravy. Not bad. We also ordered one topped with a bolognese sauce which was hearty and flavorful. The pogo (corn dog) had a great homemade batter and was perfectly cooked. Service: You order at the counter and you pick it up at a counter too. You'll also bus your own tray when you're done. Cost: About CAD$55 after tax and tip for a small poutine, a large poutine with bolognese sauce, a pogo, and two sodas in a can. Overall: Bit pricey for what it was, but worth trying nonetheless. Interior is definitely geared towards folks not staying too long. Seats are built in stools with no backs. They take cash and cards."

The large is way too big. The fill it all the way to the top. I got the bbq pulled pork and it was soooo good but not too strong. I don't have much to say because there is nothing to complain about.The people were very friendly and they can speak English. It's really cute inside. La vache qui rit was quite good too. Very peppery which I liked.Definitely come here and try it out!

I've had this place in my bookmarks for a while but it's a bit out of my way so never thought I'd go. I ordered the regular poutine and was a bit disappointed there was so little cheese but the appeal of this place is to get their speciality poutines. Adam got the bs which is bason sausage and it was delicious. They have lots of seating but not in a organized ways. They're mostly tables for groups. I also found that since the seating was only stools, it was uncomfortable. But even then the place is great! A really great neighbourhood joint. I think it's great for takeouts or group hangouts at lunch."

Inside stool seating, some with window view. There's English menus. Friendly staff. Small is big & large is shareable. I got poutine with cheese curd, gravy, hamburger, bacon, & peas. Never knew cheese curd squeak when u chew it, different. Obviously gravy makes the fries soggy, so I realize poutine is not my thing cause I like crispy fries. But the place was busy, which is a good sign."

I have been served it here and there but this place is only about it. I opted for the beef and onions and mushrooms. I was starving and saw the petit bowl and went for the gross size. Mistake. Petit is way more than enough. In any case, loved it. Absolutely loved it. I think in cold weather I might be here a lot more. But I really liked the space with the open windows and breeze which you wouldn't get if it were colder out. Anyway, my wife had the Mao chicken, and holy cow - super!!I am not an expert but I'd be hard pressed to find another place better than this one."

Luckily Poutine Centrale was just a quick Bixi ride away.My sister and I shared the grosse size of La Sautée (onions, mushrooms, herbs and more) and it was the perfect portion. The cheese curds were squeaky and we liked that the gravy wasn't too salty or greasy. Pricing was also reasonable, although I was bummed they didn't take MasterCard (Visa or cash only).While we were stuffing our faces, there was a delivery guy bringing in sacks and sacks of potatoes.

This was one of the top places to go to in the area I was staying in. Wasn't sure about it when we were makingnoutbway over there. It pretty hidden. And my friend and I were walking there when it was sort of dark out.Once we got in there, well  first it looked closed, but once we checked to hours and went in, it was a nice establishment. The people there seemed pretty friendly. Granted everywhere we went, everyone spoke French, and I don't. But they were ok about it and were willing to help is out. I ordered the General Taos chicken in large. Really big servings sizes so be warned. I enjoyed mine. My friend, not so much. Think she was turned off by all the cheese that was in it. But she liked the side order of fries that she got. All in all a good place to go."

We ordered the La Smoked Meat (smoked meat, curds, gravy) and the La Merguez  (merguez sausage, onions, curds, gravy). Both were super yummy, perfectly seasoned, and had a good cheese-to-fries ratio.

/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Pretty authentic, higher-quality poutinerie in the French section of town - so authentic, in fact, that the servers could barely speak passable English when I visited. Heureusement, j'ai etudié un peu de français en lycée. There are a lot of toppings and varieties to choose from, and the combos (which come with a soda) are a decent value. The meat toppings are fairly good quality and pretty tasty, unlike generic poutine, so you feel as if you're eating something that's somewhat upscale instead of the plebeian comfort food that it's made out to be. Even my picky parents of Chinese descent, who usually gripe endlessly if we're not going out for Chinese food, sucked it up and said that they actually enjoyed the opportunity to ""eat like locals."" Now that says a lot. C'est bon / not bad!"

The sandwiches were ok, nothing out of the ordinary or spectacular. They were served with an abundance of fries....Which leads me to the poutine. The fries were a bit soggy and greasy for my personal taste, which means after being smothered in gravy, cheese curds, and butter chicken they didn't stand a chance. Service is fast - order at the counter and pick up at the counter. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but we were in the neighborhood so it fit the bill."

/user_details?userid=rls4xC1sFAy6aLAoLtwXPA,Matt W.,"Niskayuna, NY",5 star rating,"Holy Cheese Curds, Batman, the best poutine I've ever had. A long block down and a couple of short blocks over from Pie IX metro, and a great option if you're in the neighborhood for the touristy stuff, as we were.The classic has just the right combination of gravy and fries were  fresh and not overcooked at all. The menu has a great set of unusual combinations - the veggie poutine with mushrooms was rich and delicious, as was the smoked meat bowl - and they have sriracha on the table! Good but small selection of mostly local beers available. The portions are gigantic in the large - if you're really hungry, I suggest ordering two small bowls of different types, and/or sharing to get a great variety. I heroically finished my large but then I had to sleep off the meal for three days.Now, the decor is a fabulous industrial design, with repurposed wood railroad ties for seats and laser-cut metal for tables, and it is very attractive. But it's also hideously uncomfortable. Maybe younger people can tolerate it more, but even my kids were complaining about how much it hurt to sit there. I honestly am tempted to shave off a star for my sore butt, but the food was so good I can't bring myself to do it.Service as prompt and very friendly; you order at the counter and they bring it out, possibly the best of all possible worlds.Update: an earlier version of this review opined the potatoes might not have been cut fresh even though they tasted that way, but the owner wrote to me and corrected that. Fresh cut! Should have known! Fantastique!"

The cashier wasn't sorry about misleading us and said that we should have asked whether a beef burger was actually a mixed meat burger and that was our fault. NOT COOL!"

Sigh, after a lengthy trek on bicycles all the way across town, we were underwhelmed. If you were young, male, hip, and wanted to fill your Poutine with multiple meat options this is likely your place. After having  off the charts Poutine in Val David, we decided to try something local and hoped for better than soggy fries buried under mountains of gravy- which is the norm. I  my ( chose the wrong) veggie option and instead of a hint of blue cheese, found my sauceless poutine buried under slabs of bland orange cheddar and a mound of sour cream. My boyfriend wanted to have a baseline comparison and simply had a large regular. It was huge, full of bland gravy and average cheese curds, turning quickly into a pile of mush. The fries had a good taste, but were oh so greasy. We would give it 2.5 stars but it was a cute industrial type space and very chill. We didn't get the hype."

Yes. Poutine Centrale. It was within walking distance (v. important). It specializes in a distinctly Montrealese cuisine (v. important). Sold.Once we got there, we of course ordered a ton of poutine because we definitely wanted to try everything. The fiancé was insisting on a variation that had bacon and vienna sausages. That was not up my alley at all, so I didn't touch it, but he enjoyed it.The regular poutine was tasty, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the gravy could use a little lovin'. Cheese curds were where it's at, though. They were super fresh, and thereby super squeaky!But I decided to get something a bit different. And I knew The Boy was going to want to eat most of it, so I sprung for the large. Of a General Mao Poutine. Holy god. Who even came up with this combination? It's French fries, k? Rolled around in Szechuan sauce, k? With melty cheese curds, k? TOPPED WITH GENERAL TSO CHICKEN, SESAME, AND CHIVES. Like, holy WTF? But out of the three dishes we sampled, this one was by far our favorite. What a weird and delicious combination. Whomever came up with it deserves an award. I kind of wish we had gone when we were perhaps under the influence of assorted fun-makers, because I probably would have had something resembling a foodgasm. I almost passed out on my bench. My only negative comment would be that the pommes frites could have been crispier. But everything was super fresh and high-quality, so it can easily be overlooked.We somehow made it through my man's dish, and the entire bowl of General Mao. (By the by, portions are generous, but judging by the small vs. large, it's always going to be a much better deal to buy the large, especially if sharing. Large is easily two or three times the size of the small.) We barely touched the regular poutine because we were so full. Which actually ended up being good, as we packed it up, and were about to take it back to our hotel, but then we ran into a very nice, very hungry young panhandler, and we gave him the poutine. And he immediately started chowing down, so we think he liked it, too.Only bad news is you definitely won't want to be doing anything after eating here, so it's probably a good thing we had to walk to the Pie IX Metro, a few blocks from the restaurant.Service was quick, staff was friendly, decor was modern. If we lived around here, we'd most certainly be back."

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Some of my out of town friends who dearly love poutine and constantly ask me to bring them to new poutine locations that they read about online brought me to Poutine Centrale to try out their poutine.Esthetically the place looks quaint with their wooden tables and chairs. You'll order from a huge counter and then the food is brought to you and while it looks quaint enough one thing is pretty apparently after some time after sitting... it's simply not comfortable seating. There are no ""banquets"" or any seats of any sort that provide back support and thus if you want to sit back and enjoy your meal and chat with your friends you'll be mistaken. Perhaps this is a strategy of sorts to make sure that their customers don't tend to sit about too longer after they eat but all in all, it definitely took away from the dining experience. It simply wasn't comfortable beyond 15-20 minutes.As for the poutine itself, I went with a small ""Le Gros Pork"" which is basically a classic poutine with bacon. Overall, it was a decent poutine with good fries, good gravy and a decent number of curds but nothing outstanding. It could have been far better if there was a more generous amount of curds and if the bacon was at least chopped and put within the poutine itself instead of having a couple whole slices of bacon on top of my poutine? It felt really anti-climatic to order a bacon poutine and not see the synergy of your poutine craving come together. You eat the bacon slices and you have a classic poutine.Boring.It's like wanting a spork but all you get is a spoon and a fork. Yes, I kinda got what I ordered but honestly? I wanted my spork.All in all, a decent experience but nothing to write home about. The price-tag is about average."

/user_details?userid=wuwx-kVrp1MH6BxsAeKc7A,Lynn D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I came across this place after staying at a friend's place nearby. She recommended that I go to this place if I wanted really good authentic poutine. I am so glad I got the chance to. I stopped by here on a Saturday night. Located in the Hochelaga neighbourhood, you will miss it if you aren't looking carefully. This place offers a wide variety of different poutines. I tried the small buffalo chicken poutine. It was amazing. The small portion in my opinion was a meal itself. It came out steamy and hot. Fries were thickly cut and smothered in delicious gravy. Cheesecurds seemed fresh as you could hear the squeaky sounds as you devoured every bite. Buffalo chicken was a hit in my books. I also sampled some of my friend's smoked meat poutine, which was equally as good, sweet Montreal smoked meat covered with melted cheesecurds and gravy. This place also serves beer as well, I would have sampled some, but I was too full from the small poutine.I will say that this place is fairly pricey for a poutine place, for two small poutines, and a soft drink will run you about $25. But I think it is a treat if you go here once in a while. Most of their poutines will average about $8-11 for a small size.The ambiance itself is pretty modern and laid back. We both sat along the front as people watched as we devoured our poutine. Would recommend stopping by and checking this place out."

Got a large of the smoked meat, and it was literally the best poutine I've eaten--and I've had a few. The gravy, curds, and meat were all balanced in perfect proportions so that you got a little of each down to the last bite.I ALSO had the best corndogs (or pogos as they call them here) I've ever eaten, with a house-made batter that's simply to die for and a seasoned mayo or ketchup for dipping (both are good).A little pricey, but worth going out of the way for.

Seriously.The poutine is good, but definitely not enough to justify these prices.The topping we both had was the General Tao, and it was tasty, yes, and the chicken was tender, but it wasn't great General Tao on its own.TL;DR: you will overpay for getting unusual toppings on an okay poutine.Also, uncomfortable seating."

Can't go wrong with a poutine place!To start with, the service was great. My friend and I couldn't decide what to order and they were patient and helpful.We ordered a large Hochelaga poutine with bacon, onions and mushrooms, and a small General Mao poutine with chicken and green onions.First of all, they get the basics right. The cheese was squeaky good and the fries were fresh cut. My only criticism would be that the large size poutine has so many fries underneath that it's almost impossible not to end up with a big bowl of soggy fries left over by the time the toppings are done - which we were too full to finish. I guess we should have ordered two smalls.The bacon was crisp and delicious, though I would have liked to have seen them left cut a bit larger. The mushrooms and onions were caramelized and so flavourful that I almost forgot about the bacon. The best part was the General Mao chicken, which was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and coated in a sweet, sticky sauce that would fit in at a good Chinese restaurant. The only thing missing was some heat, which is usually expected with a Mao style preparation.This was definitely a pleasant surprise and I would go again if I was in the area."
