/user_details?userid=ElZ2ELzuaSiVOX6d3XgKeQ,Michael P.,"Charlestown, RI",3 star rating,"Ok so 3.5 stars if that was a thing. What a beautiful space. Felt like I was in a log cabin in the woods. I arrived for dinner mid-week and just after the city was hit with two feet of snow. The space was warm and cozy but very quiet that evening. I sat at the bar and grabbed a glass of wine. I ordered the steak and frites and had asked if I could get mashed potatoes instead of the fries.The steak was good however the portion was a bit small. Maybe I am used to American sized portions however it was a much smaller amount of steak than I anticipated. The potatoes unfortunately lacked flavor and fell flat. I also found the menu to be very limited on options and none of the starters that evening struck my fancy so I dove right in with my entree. Great vibe, cozy and warm however I left a bit dissappointed with the food."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"Using Open Table to procure some easy points and find some good restaurants I stumbled upon this place!  I'll tell you why I came back 2 more times!Atmosphere/Appearance: Set downtown, but in more of a laid back district beyond the big skyscrapers is this gem.  It's set into an old building (given the architecture) and can easily be missed.  Just look for the moose sign above your head. Once inside you immediately walk downstairs and into the host area.  There is a private table straight ahead and to the right is the bar area.  Make another right and you can walk back into the 2 dining areas.  The restaurant isn't the biggest so I always suggest reservations for sure.  The moose is celebrated widely here so you'll see pictures or sculptures of it plastered all over.  The bartender/owner did explain it to us, but I can't remember the exact words that were exchanged.Service: Mike and Kyle took excellent care of us whenever we came in.  We always sat at the bar and loved how personable they were.  I believe Mike was the owner and bartender, unless he just gave us the feeling that he was.  He was entertaining, friendly and took excellent care of us.Food: QUAIL, QUAIL, QUAIL.  If they have it... (it goes fast), you NEED to try the quail.  I was told I had to try this delicate bird during my time in the French city and I'm so happy that I did.  It was BURSTING with flavor and I just couldn't believe how much flavor this lil' bird had!  I absolutely loved it and made sure to get it every time I stopped in.  For my entrees I was able to try the Bison Burger and Lobster Agnolotti (lobster meat with turnip and potato agnolotti along with shaved vegetables) then topped with grated parmesan cheese. It was pretty decent, but I don't know if it lacked something or just the quail packed that much of a punch.  That was kinda my feeling with all 3 meals I had here.  They were good, but I wasn't blown away like I was with the quail.  The 3rd entree I was able to try was one of their specials of the day, poached halibut.  The quality of the food here is very high, but I would like some more flavor from some of the dishes.  If they could make that quail into a meal, I'd be all for it!  Until then, I'll just need to get 2 or 3 quail appetizers and bypass the entree.  Lol.Value: All prices are in $CAD.  This place isn't cheap by any means, but the food is certainly worth it.  The quail will run you $18.00.  It's not an easy bird to come by, so I get it.  My Bison Burger was $30.00 and it did come with a choice of side.  The special of the day when I was there was the Poached Halibut and was $32.00.  Last, but not least was the Lobster Agnolotti and that was $38.00.  So yeah man, bring the big bucks and splurge, it's worth it.In conclusion I really enjoyed myself here.  The only letdown for me was the lack of enthusiasm in the entrees, but that quail... saves everything!"

I got the lobster and ravioli dish - the lobster was a bit tougher than I expected and really the only reason for the 4 star (instead of 5). The duck with carrot 3 ways was perfectly cooked and balance of flavor.  Contrary to what we've heard people ate later here...it was almost empty when we arrived at 7:30 and we were questioning if we made a bad pick...when we left, the place was full."

/user_details?userid=m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"From the moment our group was dropped off at this restaurant for dinner I knew this place was something special. Located on a narrow one way street, L'Original was one of the best meals I had eaten in a while.My buddies and I were here to have a bachelor party dinner and we were able to somehow secure an 8:30pm reservation here on a Saturday evening, despite the restaurant being completely packed. The interior was dimly lit and not too noisy. We were seated near the bar where a few tables were placed together for us to sit.The menu was one page, and reasonably priced, but full of delectable sounding appetizers and entrees. Since we were such a large group, we decided to order the Bone Marrow from the appetizers to share and we all got our own individual dishes. For main courses, there was so much goodness to choose from, including, salmon, cod, steak, mushroom fettucine, schnitzel, bison burger and rabbit. The special for the day was quail.In the end, we were all spread around, with people ordereding the House Cut Steak, Pork Schnitzel and Quail. Me? Well, I went with the Rabbit Saddle, since the Lobster Risotto was not available. In addition, we also ordered the Truffle Poutine on the side for the table to share as well.So, first, the Bone Marrow. Each order came with 2 bone marrows and it was delicious. The red wine sauce was the perfect touch on the marrows and brought out so much flavor. As always, there just wasn't enough.Next, the Truffle Poutine. May I say, GET IT! This might have been the most delicious dish I had tried while in Montreal. I can't speak for any other dishes, but this dish was as good as it got. The poutine was full of gravy and cheese curds and with the truffle mixed in, it really hit the perfect spot. Truly a perfect dish.Lastly, my entree was the Rabbit Saddle. It was stuffed with buckwheat, bacon, green olives and served with some sauteed mushrooms, fingerling potatoes and veggies. The saddle was really good. It was fresh and delicious. I can't say I wouldn't have traded it for the delicious-looking House Cut Steak, as the dish was massive and the steaks looked excellent, but I was still satisfied with the rabbit.Our evening was excellent and the waitress was extremely friendly. All of our food arrived on time and everything was taken care of professionally. We couldn't have had a greater experience."
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We wanted a little cozy, fancy place for a special occasion and L'Orignal was just so pretty and inviting. We were the very first ones on the scene at 6:00pm! The waiter wasted no time: did we know there was a second service at 8:30? Had we chosen yet? Be right back! The menu is small but everything is very appetizing - I made a mental note to come back for all of that seafood selection. We went for everything. The French Kiss cocktail was a hit among us, but the appetizer was honestly the star of the meal: sweet onion cream with lard shavings. My salad was good, but couldn't compare to the glory of that soup, and it remains everyone's favourite of the night. Get it!The truffle poutine was very salty; although the portion was generous for a side, we could still taste a hint of truffle. I got the dish of the day, stuffed rabbit. I originally thought it would be stuffed with foie gras, but I tasted a spicy sausage blend? It was good, it was filling, I was happy. The mousse that went alongside it was definitely liver and delicious. In the end, we didn't splurge on desserts, which all seemed more commonplace. We loved the soup, the decor, and the excellent 80s playlist!"

/user_details?userid=dFiLvHPC9BPfzhxv7XC_ig,Truc N.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"We had a nice dinner in Montreal as a large group. They were very accommodating. You can taste the quality in the food. It might have looked small but was super rich, and everything tasted delicious!Beef tartare - Mild, buttery meat accompanied by a sauce that can be likened to a fancy In-n-Out-like spread sauce with less onion. Tastes like thousand island meets mayo.Mushroom toast - Rich brioche with cooked mushroomBone marrow - What's not to like? Fatty and flavorful oily paste consistency. Only complaint is there wasn't not enough bread to soak it all upBeet salad - Fresh beets, not with greens, pistachio crumble, nutty buttery paste at bottom. Interesting composition and textures, probably the favorite dish for meBrussels sprouts - Sweeter than I expected, slightly vinegary and crisp. Layers of flavorPoutine - The ingredient ratio of fries to cheese curds and gravy were on point. The fries weren't my favorite, some pieces were still soft and potatoeySticky Toffee - Fluffy cakelike texture, like a spiced bread pudding but not as dense. At first skeptical about how much I'd like it from the description as I'm not into super sweet deserts. While sweet, it had a darker, molasses type tone to it and didn't overwhelm."
/user_details?userid=_Ntg87ugjBw6IFy29_EGqg,Gino B.,"Montréal-Nord, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We came as a group for a luncheon and ordered a set menu. The service was really good, timely and very friendly. The food was decent but not really memorable. For starters we had some really good malpeque oysters. This was followed by a clam chowder soup that was hearty and warm. It was savory but not enough to have a wow factor. We also tried some beef bone marrow. Now we've had these in the past but this time they were bland, and really not enticing. The mushrooms and scallions were a good accompaniment.The main center of attraction was the beef Wellington . The beef was cooked a touch too much and the pastry crumbled to small pieces. A nice touch was baked potatoes with lobster topping that was tasty. We ended it all with a bread and cheese platter that was good. Dessert was a nice piece of chocolate cake that was delicious. So that's it, an average sort of meal in a cool trendy Canadiana style decorated restaurant/bar. Kind of pricey, and note that  there are other similar restaurants in Montreal that offer memorable cuisine at the same price point."
/user_details?userid=TVl-6rwmk98I0mHLIKGjVg,Jean K.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,We had a very good meal here. Love the setting. The food was tasty. Service was ok. Waitstaff felt a bit green. One of the servers kept bringing the wrong dishes to us. Timing of food was a bit off. It took a very long time for our appetizers to arrive 30m or so (I believe the person shucking the oysters was struggling- it is labor intensive). The lobster pasta dish has some seasoning (I'm guessing tarragon) which I didn't love. I feel like that is a seasoning that should have been mentioned in the description on the menu. Because  that is a divisive seasoning.
/user_details?userid=OCizBSsT7V0TceW2pSbzYg,Philip M.,"Greater Carrollwood, FL",3 star rating,"Quick Summary:Pros: the Bison Burger, Salmon TarTar, Toffee Date Cake Pudding & Choco Coffee Mousse, decorCons: Service, Shrimp Risotto, Crème Brûlée (the brûlée part)Details:We went as a party of 5 for our friends birthday and it was decent food that was a bit overpriced. Our party split the food between all of us so we can have an almost tapas-like experience and taste as many dishes as possible.Appetizers:Bone Marrow- this was definitely the most bone marrow I encountered in a restaurant so I was excited. However only the roasted outside portions had flavour. The deeper you got in the marrow, the more it just tasted like bland fat. Salmon Tartar- wonderful vinaigrette with a nice spicy kick! Very fresh tasting Meals:Bison Burger- this was everyone's favourite meal dish. It had a great sauce, the bun was crispy and soft and the meet wasn't over cooked! Truffle Poutine- great poutine except There was barely any truffle flavour. I guess they tried to make it subtle but I found it was too subtle considering you're spending an extra $8 to replace the friesWild Mushroom Fettuccine- had good taste but fettuccine had a weird texture. It seemed over-boiled because all the fettuccine was sticking together and pretty puffy but the inside was a bit tough so it had a undercooked inside with an over cooked exterior ‍Shrimp Risotto- everyone's least favourite dish...the shrimp was bland but edible...the risotto was insanely salty...we didn't complain about it since it was split in 5 and everyone was tasting it. But after yesterday's service, maybe we should have.Icelandic Cod- fish tasted great and had a nice crisp to it but the broth tasted more on the fishy side. Not bad but probably would have paired better with a creamy liquid...but what do I know, I'm just an amateur reviewer Desserts:Sticky Toffee Pudding- very good! The cake paired nicely with the toffee sauce and the vanilla ice cream cut down on the sweetness. 2 of them said it was too sweet but I enjoyed it Coffee Chocolate Mousse- very good too! The mousse had a hint of espresso and good texture. Served in a cute jar.Crème Brûlée- the Crème part was really good! But the brûlée part was burnt. Service: First a few of my friends asked what the bone marrow was and the waitress (who turned out to be the manager) said, ""Well, I don't know what to tell you, it just tastes like fat."" in a very passive aggressive way. We didn't take it to heart, we just thought she was having trouble finding the words. She recommended a good cocktail to me (which I forgot what it was) and she took a few pictures of us when we asked her to. As for the brûlée, we complained about it being too burnt and asked if they can return with a less brûlée'd one. The bus boy told us the chef said that this was the minimum brûlée that was possible and he then went on to explain to us how a brûlée was done and why it's impossible to do it less brûlée'd (three times). He then asked if we wanted another dessert and it would be on the house. So we chose the mousse, since it was good!We then saw the Crème brûlée on the bill and told the person (who was neither the bus boy or the waitress) that it wasn't supposed to be supposed to  be on the bill. She got the manager, who ended up being our waitress and charged us instead for a second mousse. We then went on to explain to her that he said it was on the house and she said he doesn't have authority to make that decision and then proceeded to call us cheap and then remove the second mousse from the bill. It wasn't even about the money. We spent $300 excluding tip on a mediocre meal so don't call us cheap when you have a person representing your company telling us that it's on the house. Other than that, it was ok. Not something I'd return for- because that manager/waitress left us with a bad taste in our mouth."

A light snow had just begun as we were walking there. As we arrived and went down the stairs, it felt like we were entering a chalet. The decor gave it a very cozy atmosphere. I was so ready to love this place. Alas, the food didn't live up to the atmosphere. I got the mushroom soup, which was served lukewarm and came with a dollop of oil. We also shared the truffle poutine and the pan seared salmon. The potatos were bland but salmon​ was good (albeit standard). We had the chocolate mouse, which we thought tasted like what you buy in a supermarket. We were surprised when one of our servers said the mouse was very popular and everybody loves it. I think the food is way overpriced for what it is. On the bright side, the drinks were good. We were happy with the cocktails we had. I got the stout beer which was very tasty. Maybe it's just that the kitchen was having an off day or maybe it was Saturday night and the servers were already tired. Based on our experience with the food and service, and given that Montreal is loaded with fabulous bars and restaurants, I would not fancy going back there anytime soon."
/user_details?userid=lC6Br6zsyPz1mByykDzG9g,Ramiro C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favourite places in Montreal. The food is great and their drink selection is varied and ever-changing.It sits a few steps down from the street level which gives it a homy sense and a place that feels that is catering to you (as a found place). The decor almost screams Canadiana but with a very accommodating style.I always try to stop by every time I am in Montreal for food and drinks or that special gammy burger.Hope you all enjoy as much as I do.

The menu had poutine so a friend and I were sold!You walk in and it feels like an old log cabin, really warm and inviting. We chose to take table, but the have a pretty big bar section as well that was a little more casual.The menu had a lot of exciting things so we split the items that were calling to us!Oysters were super fresh and 6 was barely enough, we could and should have ordered more..The truffle poutine hit the spot covered in gravy and cheese curds. The truffle flavor was faint, but still there. Glad we got in this Canadian staple at this meal!For mains we ordered the salmon and the cauliflower. Salmon was perfectly cooked and pretty standard dish, but the cauliflower was the dish that impressed the most. I'm not one for vegetarian dishes, but it was so soft and full of flavor along with some kale and lentils rounding out the plate.With that, there was no room for dessert.. bummer!"

You go down some stairs & you'll be surprised on how nice the place is. Dim lights, feels like your in a cabin & bar area is cute. You walk in & they get your jacket & hang it. I got the cucumber caesar drink- the best!! Its the canadian version of bloody marry but I don't drink bloddy marry. Caesar drink is my favorite. Its spicy & its just the best drink ever! The pickled spicy string beans is great. appetizers: Roasted beet salad- goat cheese, apples, pickled squash. I don't like goat cheese so I told the waiter not to put it but he said its not the ordinary goat cheese I've tried before & I must atleast try it so he still gave it & put it on the side. I was surprised that it taste really good & doesn't smell. It taste very delicious with the salad. This is the best salad I've ever had. Bone marrow, rabbit liver parfait- with toast on the side & little mushroom. Perfect to share for 2 people. Very tasty!Main dish: Terre de bison burger- bacon, mapple mustard, onion jam, pickle & fries. The pickle is strong but it taste good so we didn't really taste the mustard & its a good thing coz I don't like mustard. My dish is their special of the night but I forgot the name. Haha. Its chicken with mash potato- thiers fried chicken & another chicken that cooked semilar to filipino adobo chicken. Its unique because you'll try both in 1 plate & everything is cooked perfectly with mash potato & some yummy sauce. They balance everything from taste to serving size. Appetizers are in good size but the main dish is huge. Very nice place & I highly recommend this to any local or tourist!"

We have no idea where to go so a four star 180 plus reviews warrants a visit. The front door is off the cuts a little so don't anticipate a huge door sign. Just remember it's off Alexis St. We almost walked past it. Appetizer: I had a side of French fries and the wife had Oysters. We were both pleased. The fries were seasoned deliciously and crispy. Wife said the oysters with the horseradish and vinegar sauce was perfect. Entrees: I had the pork parmigiana. Imagine chicken parmigiana but with PORK + spaghetti with meat sauce. First for me and it was delicious. Just an FYI, the portion is humongous. I couldn't finish it. My wife had the Icelandic Cod and she had no complaints. Dessert: I was full but when the waiter said there is a house-made pumpkin pie... time to man up. It was DELICIOUS! My wife had a cup of red wine from some 2011 reserve thing from Espana. I'm not a wine drinker but it was so good we bought a bottle to bring home. I left the place way too full. You know that uncomfortable feeling in your stomach where you keep asking yourself why you ate so much. Five stars. We were super happy with this place!"

There is no sign over the door, but the simple menu on the stand outside tells you that this is a place that takes its food seriously. When you walk through the door, you are immediately greeted by smells of faint pine and wood smoke. Mellow music plays from high quality overhead speakers, and spans from Bob Dylan to Coldplay. You descend a staircase and enter into a Canadian hunting lodge mixed with a wine bar mixed with a gastropub. The floor is wood, the walls are stone and mortar, adorned with vintage decor; and the ambiance is at once welcoming and intimate. The staff are warm and friendly, and almost sense your preference of language, blending between the two seamlessly (if you prefer). The seating is limited, but groups are welcomed the same as singles. It may be the strong selection of mixed drinks, or the warmth of the candlelit lighting, but strangers soon become friends in this place, and there is a sense that you are all part of a lucky few who found this respite of pure Canadian bliss. Come inside, hang up your coat, sit down, order a drink, and stay awhile. You will not be disappointed."

The menu is always changing and they always seem to have a nightly special. It is tucked away on a sidestreet in old montreal and you might walk by it if you're not careful. It is down some steps and is setup like a cozy hunting cabin. They usually have a good selection of fresh oysters and if you sit at the bar you can watch them being shucked. On my most recent trip we had the bone marrow app which was good but I'd rather have some softer bread served woth it so you can really soak up all that goodness. The beer and endive app is really terrific. My wife had the mushroom risotto which is almost large enough for 2 people, it was excellent. I had the hunters rabbit which was phenomenal! The roasted veggies with the perfectly cooked rabbit is a very well balanced dish. We always stay near the Basilica so L'Original is always on our list of places to eat. Can't wait to go back."

The goods: This was the last stop on a belated birthday food adventure that started the night before and basically ran the course of Saturday. Not surprisingly (if you know me), I was still hungry by the time we got here, despite a pit stop at Christian Faure two hours earlier. We started with cocktails - I went with the Moosanada while my date chose the Moscow Moose. We both enjoyed our beverages. Mine was pretty refreshing and reminded me a tiny (tiny) bit of a Pimms cup except you know, it had tequila and mescal. We then decided to share the salmon tartar with cucumber dill and thinly cut crackers. The tartar was delicious and had a buttery flavor that blended well with the cucumber dill. Very, very nice. If you want to order an appetizer but want to keep it light, this is a great choice.  In terms of mains, we both ordered the bison burger. For those of you know know me (or have read my reviews), you already know I'm not a meat eater. Instances where I crave something meat-related are few and far-between, so when I tell you that this burger was the shit, you should absolutely take that seriously. This burger was THE SHIT. Perfectly cooked and oh so juicy - I actually ate it with a fork and knife because the alternative would have left me covered in meat juice and then I'd be banned from the restaurant for being a sloppy eater. Maple mustard, bacon and onion jam - all of these things made this burger the best burger ever. Seriously, get the burger. The home-made fries were crispy and not at all greasy - which is surprising since they are allegedly cooked in duck fat (that's what the waitress said - but I'm still doubtful because there wasn't any grease to be found on the fries or on the plate!). My friend and I were super satisfied with our selections. Dessert however, underwhelmed us; we ordered the chocolate-espresso mousse, which tasted nothing like espresso, and was sweet but not in a chocolatey way, if that makes sense. I'm glad I had a chocolate-related dessert prior to dinner (=-D.  I'd also ordered a Macchiato and really, I don't know why the hell I bother ordering this anywhere outside a proper coffee shop, because all I EVER get is an espresso with frigging foam. Come on, people! So stick with regular coffee and you'll be fine. They use Lavazza. I like Lavazza, though admittedly, I only ever use their Espresso roast. Anyway.Service: Good. Price point: Not bad considering where we were. I think the total bill with taxes came out to $120, which is significantly less then our previous night's meal (stay tuned - I'm writing that review next). This is a great spot to check out. Will definitely go back."

/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We got dinner at this place at about 9:30pm on a sat. night. If u dont wanna read the whole thing, here's the short version:The good: the interior design and the cocktails.The bad: overpriced agreeable main dishesThe ugly: rude service with big attitudeWe  ordered the salmon and a poutine to share and got a drink each. The cocktails were the highlight of the night: the espresso martini and the Moscow moose were quite enjoyable. The salmon was simple and nice. But at above 30$ we found it quite overpriced for the simple preparation and presentation. The poutine gravy was kinda thin and bland and the potatoes were most definitely not freshly made. The most disappointing part of the meal was the dessert though. We saw a photo of their chocolate mousse on yelp and ordered that. In about 30 seconds our server came back with something that didn't look like the yelp photo. I took a photo of our dessert b/c i actually found it hard to believe that they would serve such an unimaginative chocolate mousse in Montreal. There's at least one excellent bakery in every neighborhood where you can buy mouthwatering chocolate mousse for less than $5. And we payed $8 for what's seen in the attached photo. When asked how we liked everything, we told her that the dessert was not as interesting as we expected and mentioned that it didn't look like the yelp photo. She said what we had was one of their most popular desserts and that the yelp photo was smores and whoever uploaded it had no idea what they'd had! I then asked her how come the ""smore"" in the photo had no crackers or marshmallows. She said what looked like whipped cream in the photo was actually a marshmallow and went on to explain what smores are! and how they are done in Quebec...I think this place is totally overrated on yelp. I appreciate the nice interior design, but the rest is absolutely an underwhelming representation of Montreal's french restaurants - more of a tourist trap really. If you're looking for a french restaurant, do yourself a favor, skip this place and get dinner at l'express or robin square instead; the food is much better, the atmosphere is more authentic, the service is excellent and you'll actually have a good time."

We originally went in to have a drink and an appetizer, but went on to enjoy a full dinner there. The food was fantastic (especially the steak), and the drinks were perfectly constructed. The bartender was very accommodating and helpful as we went through the night. I would highly recommend this restaurant for food or cocktails. One note: in Montreal many restaurants need to sell some food in order to serve you alcohol. In most bars/restaurants, you can order the smallest appetizer and that will suffice. In this case, I actually ended up staying for dinner since the appetizer and drinks were so great."

Upon entry, the walk down the stairs gives a good woodsy scent; I'm not sure if it's year round or just because it's the Holiday season.The menu is terse and curated seasonally. I ordered the rabbit and definitely enjoyed my dish. The sauce paired perfectly with the flavor of the rabbit. It wasn't very gamey, which is always nice, but was moist and easy to enjoy. Everyone else I came with also enjoyed their dishes! Servers were really nice and the place feels very homey, being tucked in a corner of Old Montreal. I definitely recommend it when you're in Montreal. Come here for a dinner, make a reservation if it's a weekend, and enjoy!"

The food is prepared fresh and cooked to order but it took AN HOUR to get our duck and risotto. Our server explained they don't start cooking the entree until they serve the appetizer so that's why it took so long but after watching people who arrived after you get their food first, my patience and appetite was getting quiiitee thing. But lobster risotto was amazing and worth the wait but the duck wasn't new or had that 'wow' factor. Great place to try if you're visiting Montréal! Probably one of the best restaurants we tried while in Montreal for 4 days!"

For Drinks I had the Arnold Palmer, it was good but nothing spectacular. Partner had, another specialty cocktail, which was really good(I forgot the name. For our main course I had the lobster pasta which I though was really good. You get a huge lobster claw and a small tail, not to mention the cut up lobster in the dish its self. The sauce was a very light creamy sauce and the pasta was cooked perfect with some peas. Partner had the rabbit which he loved. I'm not really a rabbit fan but I thought it was good.Needless to say, we both really enjoyed this place. The service, décor, and food at his place is spot on!

Fresh, plump, perfectly clean oysters were the standouts for this kid, who is currently on a kick, but I also swooned sincerely for the duck done up like smoked meat, and the roast chicken plate and the goat cheese cheese cake. Cocktails appreciated included the Moscow Moose, the grape Martini and that one with the grapefruit which was memory-bendingly delicious. I like that this restaurant is tucked off an Old Port sidestreet, an easy walk from downtown metros and close enough to cobblestones for a rolick on your walk home. I like the dim lighting, the corner tables and deep booths, and the incredibly friendly staff, who have been markedly professional by me in all cases, except for that one back and forth over our heads about who had seated whom and whose fault that was. An unnecessary awkward pause in some otherwise nicely dreamy evenings."
/user_details?userid=rk9lbxaO8adpNk6Ut6Omvw,Tee D.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"Nice vibe in a basement restaurant that feels sort of like a cozy hunting lodge.  Service was acceptable but not great.  They told us to order all at once and they would course out the meals for us but there was an unnaturally long wait between appetizer and main course so, counting that as a fail.  Also had to call them over a couple of times for drinks.  But our two waitresses were both nice.  For the food:- We had the beef tartare for an appetizer and it was the worst we've ever had.  The chunks of meat were not minced small enough so really got the feeling you were just eating a hearty serving of raw meat.  Not sure what it was mixed with other than a lot of...pickles. We thought that was really odd.  Topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and served with thousand island style dollop of dressing on the side.  Overall felt like we were eating a raw big mac.- For our main course we split the bison burger.  It was pretty good.  Simple, juicy burger with few toppings/condiments.  But was pretty good.  - We also upgraded our french fries to poutine and I think this was pretty good poutine.  However, gravy and cheese curd covered fries aren't something we could stomach every day.  But I think they made them well.  So, giving three stars because service was a little lacking, the beef tartare was not good at all and while the burger and poutine were spot on, they were a little expensive for being what they were and we could probably have gotten something similar at a place that wasn't also peddling $15 glasses of wine.

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here for Valentine's Day and pretty much didn't want to leave.I had read a lot of good reviews but nothing prepared me for the outstanding 12oz steak (AND salad) I devoured at L'Orignal...Let me start from the beginning.After reading tons of good reviews, we booked dinner at L'Orignal and looked forward to our date night. The day of, we were, of course, stuck in a typical Montrealesque rut: parking was no where to be found in the Old Port, and we were already 15 minutes late for our reservation. A quick call to the restaurant assured us that our table would be held, and indeed, we walked in 30 minutes late and were instantly seated at our table. The restaurant was packed and the ambiance was romantic (dimmed lights, etc). We were quickly offered menus from which we chose an excellent bottle of white wine (I guess they can't take credit for the good wine, right?) and settled on the salmon tartare to start, the 12oz steak for me with salad, and the rabbit dish for hubby. The tartare practically flew out of the kitchen (service was that fast) and it was DELICIOUS. We then asked for a small bread basket and this, I think, was the only disappointment of our experience. The bread was dry (not stale) and kind of tasteless but that's just a tiny detail (given that they don't provide bread on every table automatically and that you have to ask for it). At this point, we continued drinking our amazing wine, and I started second guessing my order. Did it make sense to order a steak here when there were so many other good things I could have ordered? I didn't think I had made the right decision sticking with such a no frills dish and not venturing out and trying something exciting but what a phenomenal decision the steak was! When the dishes arrived, I was in awe at how huge my steak was - there was no way one person could eat all that meat (I did.) At the same time, I took one look at my salad and thought ""uh oh. bad decision alright"" because the salad looked boring and out of a bag (neither of which was true). One bite of the steak and the salad, and I was teleported to another dimension of heavenly goodness. The steak was a slam dunk, out of this work, hole in one, and whatever other way you want to describe its perfection. I couldn't figure out how they transformed a piece of meat into what I was eating without slathering it in any sauces or anything. It was just perfect. The salad was also outstanding. I don't know what magical dressing they created but it was light and flavorful and delicious. The two went together PERFECTLY. The review is getting long and I think you get the idea that you need to visit L'Orignal and order the steak (if you eat meat) to experience what I did but all in all, I basically can't wait to come back. Hubby's dish was great, and our dessert (a hazelnut chocolate mousse) was excellent. Prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of food/excellent service, so 5 stars (well, 4.5 really because of the bread, but since I can't go with a .5, I'll round up)! Run, don't walk, to this place and order the steak with salad. You'll thank me."

It's not overly complicated, but the dishes are well considered and just plain great (Pork Chop Parmesan - not something I've seen before, but stellar!).I get the impression that this is the kind of place that people who really appreciate food and drink go to have an excellent meal without the pomp and pretension that accompanies usual fine dining.Please keep it up L'Orignal - we hope to return many many times!"

Lucky for my family and I we had our first bite of Montreal at L'Original and it was incredible. We had a bison burger, truffled poutine, and frites. All were incredible, and all were shared. Seriously, this is perfect cold weather comfort food. Deftly prepared and delicious.       Beyond the food, the space itself is special- you walk down this ancient looking (and feeling) staircase scented with some sort of wonderful wood resin and then enter the subterranean dining room lined with more wood and what looks to be ancient granite pillars. You just feel warm and cozy in here. The waitstaff are equally warm, they treated us wonderfully and were extremely efficient.      This is a very unpretentious restaurant full of excellent food and good people. Skip a lot of the scenes in Montreal. Instead, walk down these stairs, eat something special and delicious. You won't regret your visit to L'Original."

Nestled at the garden level of a side street by the Notre Dame cathedral, the lighting and overall ambiance is perfect for making you feel like you've picked the best place to relax and eat on a weekend night.The food was similarly well thought out and unique. I can't even remember the name of my fish - but it was apparently similar to what would happen if a salmon hooked up with a whitefish. Really tasty. The Baby Dutch dessert and Venison appetizer were both solid As.The oysters were also fantastic. Home made sauce and fresh sliced horseradish.

The venison tartare was amazing- the meat was fresh and the flavor was perfect. The crispy toast was a perfect vessel for it. For our shared entree, we split the schnitzel which was delicious, though it was rather on the thick side. The mushroom spätzle is was served with was also amazingly delicious.The drinks were tasty-fresh flavors and strong.

On the first night, we arrived starving after a long flight, but  the food service as closed; however, they were still kind enough to shuck some fresh oysters and provide us with some late night poutine that I'm not even sure what on the menu.  We weren't even drunk enough for poutine, but by God it was still delicious.  On Night 2, I had what was quite possibly the finest steak that I have ever eaten, and I've eaten a shit ton of good steaks. The bison was lean, but the chef was able to fatten it up to give it an enormous amount of flavor.  Wow.  What puts these guys over the top is the unbelievable customer service and overall approachability of the staff. Debbie, Michael, and I forget the chefs name were totally cool people to shoot the shit with for several hours, and I look forward to dining here again the next time I am in Montreal.  I know there are a lot of options in Montreal, but this place should be at the top of your list."

When we entered we were asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, but the place was empty & they still contemplated on finding us a table. They sat us & took drink orders the food next. After waiting nearly an hour with no one coming back over to check on us or ask if we wanted more drinks I approached the gentlemen behind the bar and asked if it would be much longer. He arrogantly told me we ordered food that requires longer time to cook. We ordered 2 steaks at medium & medium rare, bison burger (which they never asked how we wanted it cooked) vegetable risotto 6 oysters & poutine. Absurd response with an attitude. Still no drink refills.... Another 10 mins go by & we get our food with a casual ""sorry for the wait"" only to find the steaks over cooked to medium well and a charred burger. Guessing that's why it took so long, they forgot about the food. We made the arrogant bartender/manager know & his response was ""the ticket said medium not medium rare"" to which I responded that it was much more then medium too. Not even an apology or anything. We ate what we could considering we'd waited so long & let them know we were less then satisfied. The bill came & the waitress said they'd take one steak off the bill but didn't make up for the poor overall experience & the arrogant douche of a manager. Do yourself a favor and AVOID this trap with its overpriced food & awful service. Definitely our worst experience while visiting beautiful Montreal. I think they got our point when they saw the tip but with the complete non caring attitude there I doubt they will change. Many other reviews comment about long waits, bad service & over cooked meals. This trend is a constant not a one off!! Steer clear of this overpriced, underwhelming joint, you'll be happy you did!!!"

/user_details?userid=Zfs0aXaqXVb7ngUHLtVZmA,Daniel D.,"Portsmouth, RI",2 star rating,"Here are the cliff notes. 1. Expensive but not worth the cost. 2. Poor service. 3. Underwhelming menu. Let me qualify this review by saying it was a huge disappointment because of what the restaurant didn't have opposed to what we did have. After reading reviews and visiting the website I was expecting a unique dining experience. I saw myself tasting boar, bison and venison tar tar. But instead we had your run of the mill restaurant outing. The menu was basic. Really basic. Everything I saw on Yelp was left off the menu. I know places sell out of certain dishes but come on. No bison, boar, bone marrow, poutine or venison? When I asked the waitress about the lack of variety she just said ""sometimes we have those things"" no real explanation. She brought us a $7 bottle of seltzer 7 dollars for a seltzer?We had the duck tar tar which was pretty good. It was refreshing. The next was a salmon appetizer with caviar. The flavor was one note, flat and unremarkable. The service was not very good. Whoever the tall waiter is did a great job but our waitress was inattentive and disinterested. Also the attire is very casual so any reviews saying otherwise are inaccurate. It just really wasn't worth the money. Like a few of the restaurants in the area, they seem to be content with mediocrity because they're in a great location. From another review I read it seems like they switched chefs recently and it doesn't seem to be working out well. Skip this place if it's on your list. Or maybe you'll get lucky and their greatest hits will be available."

/user_details?userid=s5KuZyUrCcyULAyHZD5U_g,Tom E.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Apple and bacon pie with maple ice cream. Now that I have your undivided attention, let's start at the beginning. That was my dessert. L'Orignale is hard to find if you don't have binocular vision. It's just round the corner and into an alleyway off Rue Notre Dame (Rue Saint Alexis) in the Old City. This place is the perfect combination of a métis voyageur's cabin with a demon craft cocktail bar. All the waiters are dressed like Paul Bunyan with their checked shirts and all. The food is French and Canadian wilderness. Hearty yet imaginative. Not afraid to take small yet appreciated diversions to excite the palate. I knew what I wanted before I even walked in the door thanks to the street-side menu. Rabbit and foie gras parfait followed by a leg of venison steak chop whatever with a rossini sauce. I'm not going to rant on about either. I lie. The parfait was creamy as heck. But that was never apple jelly with it as the menu claimed. My napkin looked like Sweeney Todd's afterwards. I suspect a raspberry compote or A negative. But it was subtle, not gory. And the deer limb: it really looked like a tomahawk steak and claimed to be 18 ounces. But best of all, I was never asked how I wanted it. I approve. The chef should always decide how I want it. And how right he/she was. The venison was between medium rare and medium rare. Never chewy, just the right amount of give. And not a whiff of gaminess which surprised me but did not disappoint. Back to the bacon, maple and apple action. It finished me off. Like a British pork pie of apples and cubes of meaty Canadian bacon (as we like to call it sour of the border) with a delightful dollop of maple ice cream on top. All I wanted was a private room where I could sink my face into it without all the judginess. Please come here. Say hi to the Lumberjacks from me."

It was great date night atmosphere. Waitress seemed knowledgeable about the menu. I had the cod with celery purée and my husband had the bison burger. The cod was rather tasteless. I understand that they were probably trying not to overpower the taste of the fish but the entire dish needed some seasoning. The only thing that had flavor were the Brussels sprouts so I was pretty disappointed. My husband's bison burger was pretty tasty though. Towards the end of the meal the restaurant became very busy. Our table was neglected. We sat a while before we flagged the waitress down for the bill. Overall it was just an ok experience for me.

Ok to be honest I grabbed two more of the desserts then I grabbed their card! Since then I've had the opportunity to eat at L'Orignial twice and have thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The atmosphere and service is top notch. The restaurant is small and cozy and the design naturally breaks the space into a few even smaller areas so it feels even more intimate. As their name suggests the main thrust of L'orignal's menu is gamey, but as a person who does not eat meat (I do eat fish and seafood) I'm always able to find something scrumptious on the menu. Also, they are oyster experts, so it is a mistake not to start a meal without at least a few fresh oysters on your plate.  And of course don't forget dessert!"

The moment that made this a ""never go there again"" experience when they asked us to leave after paying so someone else could have our table, and there were other tables open.

Two empty plates with a full order of fingerlings and a bowl of mashed sitting on our table. The dude from space finically clears the table. The bill comes and the mashed potatoes are on the bill. I point it out. Waitress says we didn't charge you for the fingerlings. I say that's nice we didn't order them. I asked the mashed be taken off as they came after the meal. I could tell she was right about to ask us if we ate them. She removes them from the bill like she did us a solid.The bill comes on a hand held device with the option to tip between 15-20%.

The cod was absolutely flavorless. My wife had the lobster risotto. The risotto was thick and gummy and obviously heated from last nights dinner service. The lobster claw was delivered on a bread plate whole. Not sure how she was suppose to finish creating her dinner table side because the claw was not pre cracked or served with lobster crackers to get the meat out of the shell. I stepped up to the plate and used the butt of my butter knife to crack the claw open and removed the meat and topped her day old risotto to finish her dish table side. Lastly the service embarrassing. Upon the arrival of our main courses I had to remind the waiter we were still waiting for our wine. Avoid this place at all cost.

Staying downtown, L'Orignal was one of the first places we noticed with fantastic reviews online, but figured it was a long shot on this particular evening. We weren't wrong, but we were lucky. We walked down the stairs, pulled aside the curtain to a warm ski-lodge atmosphere, and the waitress/host/barback/bartender extraordinaire (I want to say her name was Dez, but I could be way off) came over to us and found us the only two seats in the house at the bar. The bartender who we learned was also the owner (I want to say Michael... 0-2?), chatted us up immediately and made us feel like locals even though he was insanely busy. This man was shucking oysters (smelling each and every one, which was a LOT, for freshness), grating fresh horseradish, making cocktails, motioning to staff when someone entered the restaurant without being noticed, while also making note of how long someone in the dining room had been waiting for food from the kitchen...what??? I think he might have been on that drug from that Bradley Cooper movie that gives him more brain capacity or something. He was honestly kind of a smartass too, but in the best possible way and that's why you sit at the bar, right? You want some conversation, some entertainment, some engagement and I could tell there were other bar customers there that were there precisely because of him... okay, and the food.About those oysters... We probably ate oysters at least 4-5 times while in Montreal and these were hands down the best. The other reason the owner is present here a lot of the time, other than to watch hockey, is to monitor the how the food is coming out and making sure it's to his standards. The pricetag reflects the quality, and no one here is ""mailing it in"". I was so obsessed with how good the oysters were, I can't honestly remember what we ordered on Valentine's Day, but everything was wonderful. We returned a second time before we left and I had the bison burger (and more oysters). Even after accounting for the exchange rate, this was one of the more expensive burgers I've had, but sweet Jesus was it good. The man I'm calling Michael, told us the entire backstory about the animal this came from. The farm, the lady who only butchers one every once in a while, the other bison she keeps as a pet; I'm not making this up. If that's not farm to table, I don't know what is. When we return to Montreal again, even if we stay at the complete opposite side of the city, we will definitely make a point of returning here, and maybe even make a reservation this time. So, Michael and Dez, or whatever the hell your names are, thanks for making two out-of-towners laugh and feel at home. Hope to see you again in the near future."

We had a reservation for 6:15, and given that they open at 6 there was no wait.We started with some delicious and interesting cocktails (the concord grape crush was especially good) while looking over the menu and wine list. Our appetizers were the Lamb sliders and Tuna tartar, and both were excellent.  The burgers were perfectly cooked, a little pink still inside, and the the tuna mixture was perfectly spiced and super flavorful.With our wine and meal ordered, we didn't wait long for what had become a very anticipated main dish. We were NOT disappointed. My three friends had the Deer steak special, and I went with the roasted Halibut. They went on and on about how good the deer and Polenta were, and I still can't get over just how good my fish was and the squash puree it was placed on.After all this, we decided to share some desert, sampling all 4 flavors of their AMAZING and homemade sorbets (go with blueberry and raspberry), and their white chocolate Creme Brule. The food was amazing, the service impeccable. The place isn't cheap, but it's not insanely expensive either. For everything outlined above (including a bottle of wine with dinner) we were at $100 per person After tax and tip. An average main was about $24 just for comparisons sake.I WILL be going back!"

Granted, the restaurant didn't know that we were celebrating. We're not ones to make a fuss, but we wanted a special evening. There was no host when we entered the restaurant, and a flustered looking waitress offered us a table that was right in front of the kitchen doors. No thank you. We were re-seated elsewhere, at a wobbly little table placed right where two bench cushions met. I sat on the bench, crack-to-crack. But guess what - I had the best view of Sophie Turner (AKA, Sansa Stark), who was seated 4 feet away, eating dinner with her friends. Exciting! Then I started noticing things. Sansa's poutine was 3 times the size of my poutine. Sansa's wine got a decanter, but my bottle didn't. Sansa and her friends (and the restaurant owner's friends who were sitting with us) all get some delicious looking free shots. Guess who didn't. The owner was clearly blinded by celebrity, and who can blame him. But seeing other tables get special treatment made me feel pretty under appreciated as a customer celebrating a special night. Turns out that the overly-priced food was ...meh...forgettable. My salmon was bland and swimming in a lemony sauce that made the inside of my mouth pucker. The cheesecake was tasty, but not mind blowing. Hubby had the bison burger, which he quite liked. We skipped appetizers, because nothing looked particularly appealing. Oh, if you like music from the 80's and 90's then this is the place to go. One star for getting me to sing!"

The waitress was jangly, pushy, non-responsive to requests, telling us what we should eat instead of letting us select, telling us that we were required to order entrees and mains at the same time, even though the restaurant was empty. The hard sell and the instructions on how we need to order in a vacant restaurant was off-putting. Her clipped, abrupt manner seemed to be a result of a very bad day, some awful pre-work news, a handful of diet pills or that first line of biker's coke before service. What should have been a $140 dollar peaceful meal was a $40 20-minute countdown, making us eye the door and trying to finish before the next strange encounter with the server-from-speedville.I would try it again if the front of house was a little more emotionally together and professional and the back of house was not so salty.It seems like a very nice place.

The decor is like a old style Canadian ski cabin in the Rockies, complete with old ski and paddling equipment on the walls. Service was excellent and the owner took the time to sit down with me to review gluten free options on the menu (and there were a lot of GF options!). I started with the smoked salmon and chose the Irish organic salmon for my entree. My husband had the pork tenderloin which he raved about. Interesting cocktail menu and a good wine list. We were very happy with our meals and the service. It's a funky space in the basement of one of the many old buildings in Old Montreal and only a couple blocks from the Notre Dame Cathedral. Would definitely come back here again!"

The menu had quite a few different dishes that aren't typically seen elsewhere. The oysters and beef tartare were both terrific. Oysters were clean and fresh and the beef very tasty. The pork schnitzel- which is usually a thin cutlet , was a thick pork chop that was cooked to perfection. The beef Bavette I got was delicious and also cooked perfectly with French fries that were close to the best ones I've had. Best dinner in Montreal !!"
/user_details?userid=2vJ2e51kdbdAmAo_HTr4KQ,Charlotte W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"*3.5*I was planning a birthday dinner for my bf and boy...where does one go in Montreal! With more restaurants per square mile than any other place in the world (or some insane statistic like that), the research was daunting. However, I stumbled upon L'Orignal and the reviews were good, and the website was informative, and the pictures looked great. So, I booked and was looking forward to the dinnerIntro. A walk downstairs brought us to the restaurant. It's decorated in woodsy tones and animal heads on the wall to go with the Moose theme. The place was packed for Saturday 7pm, and the hostess brought us to the worst table ever. We were wedged between a table of 14 and another table for two forming a L-shape. This meant that everyone who got up and down from the table of 14 bumped into my boyfriend and when the table beside us for two (they sat by a wall)  wanted to get out, we had to stand up. However, there were no other tables available...My bf and I started with a dozen oysters which were all right. I also had the Tuna Tartare which was the heaviest dish I have ever had. Large chunks of tuna smothered in some heavy mayonnaise-like sauce and the portion was the size of my head. Then, for my main, I had Elk which was so very big and heavy. For dessert, my bf loved their Tiramisu so much that we ordered two, so again, another heavy course.I will have to say that my review is slightly biased in that I was very sick afterwards (I suspect it was because I just had a huge Sausage lunch just hours before and I am not used to eating heavy dishes). Would I have loved the food if I was famished and on a different night? Perhaps. I'll give the restaurant that. However, I just thought the food was too much and too heavy.Service was just AMAZING! Our waitress was professional and kind and knowledgeable and very accommodating. The table for two beside us soon left and I asked if we could have their table (away from the table of 14 cougars). She said absolutely and even combined our table to make it for 4. I have to say, this was one of the best service I have received in Canadian restaurants which is why I am bumping this rating to a 3.5.With so many other restaurants in Montreal, I highly doubt I will be back here again."
/user_details?userid=kF2sEC2B1nJlxVFr_jaEQA,Lara d.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"I chose this place for my husbands 40th Birthday dinner. We were visiting Montreal and I knew he really wanted to eat game meat while visiting this area and L'Original  came up repeatedly as the place to go. The location is on a quite alley area, the restaurant is a very woodsy chic decor. I felt that the menu was amazingly inventive, however for someone who prefers not to eat game meat you choices are limited. But in the true spirit of why we came, my husband was overwhelmed by options, bison, elk, duck, it was great to see them elevated to a higher level. In full disclosure this is not a cheap place, you come here and just for food you are looking at a minimum of $50pp. The only reason I am not giving them a 5 star review, is because the waitress was down right rude. The level of service she gave us (English speakers) vs the French speaking patrons was like night and day. It was precisely the experience of she was borderline polite to us, but chatty, flirty and animated with all of the patrons around us. It was a slightly deflating experience to what was a special night for us. In the end, I will say our food was excellent. The bison tartare was flavorful with the right balance of flavors. The red salad was fresh and inventive and I enjoyed the creativity of committing to a dish that was only one color but had great flavor dimension. The chicken dish was like comfort food, hearty and would be perfect on a cold winter night. My husband opted for the surf and turf, a bison fillet and lobster served three ways. It was an artistic plating, and he enjoyed the combination of flavors. I would recommend it, but hold your expectations on the level of customer service to be low, so that you are not disappointed."

My wife's scallops were very good, however, so maybe this was just an unfortunate accident."
/user_details?userid=cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ,John T.,"Nashville, TN",4 star rating,"4.5Pricey... but the meal is worth it. For my first meal in Montreal, I had the good fortune to share it with the reigning reine of the City of Saints, Risa D. As I wandered through the narrow streets and alleyways, I wondered what she had in store. As soon as I opened the door, heard the strains of an awesome Spotify playlist and smelled what was going on in the kitchen, I knew I was in for a good night.Set in what looks like a hip hunting lodge basement, L'Orignal is original. Behind us was a Montreal version of the Sex & The City ladies. To our right was an older man and his young, buff male escort. Further in the dining room was a rowdy table of Canadian bros. Never would I think to put all these disparate types together, but it works. All this observing and judging made me thirsty, so I began the evening with a Grape Escape cocktail. For a time, I was on a muddled grape kick so this vodka concoction really fit the bill. Not only that, but it was a nice pairing with my soupe courge (that's butternut squash to you non-francophones). Warmed up and feeling good, I ordered the pasta of the day (rabbit cavatelli) and a robust Bordeaux to accompany it (Château Puy-Landry). The pasta was a revelation. Living in New Orleans for a few years, I'd had rabbit more than a few times and I was never that big a fan. Going with the dish based upon the recommendation of our waitress, I held some skepticism. It was for naught. The cavatelli was delicious and the rabbit bore none of the nasty gaminess I remembered. In fact, the meal was positively decadent and spot-on for a chilly night in Old Montreal/Old Port. Be aware that taxes run high and tip isn't included in the meal (I'm used to getting gouged with auto-gratuity in Miami)."

We didn't know exactly where to go, so we walked around near Notre Dame. This place is somewhat hidden in a small alley, but there is a sign out front.The place is very nice inside. As far as being kid friendly? It is more like a date night place type-ambiance with candles and dimly lit interior, but sure. The staff is very good with the kids and don't mind accommodating them. Our waiter was a nice young gentleman who spoke great English. My husband ordered the bison burger. It looked so delicious, so I tried a bite. It was delightful! I've never tasted anything so juicy and tasty. I ordered the Puttanesca. It was good and fresh, but they gave me very TINY clams and small portions of shrimp. It was also supposed to have capers on it, but I don't even recall seeing any capers in my dish. I should've ordered a Bison dish. After all, that is their specialty. My kids are picky, so we requested only buttered pasta for them. ""The best"" they ever had. I should hope so, since we paid $12/plate for just butter and noodles. Overall, wonderful service and decent food."

Dutifully I checked my yelp bookmarks of places I had yet to visit (Of which, I unfortunately have at this time of writing, far too many). This place sat atop the pile, and off to Old Town I began to venture.All in all, this is a fantastic experience. It's not overly expensive, around 75 a person, it has a great focus on local produce, and Quebecois game meat. A nice rustic ambiance. A nice gem in Old Port.Personally I stuck to the Yelp favourites. The tuna tar-tare had a brilliant balance of spice, and creamy sweet avocado. The tomato below, fresh, crisp, full flavoured.I opted for a main of the deer steak, perfectly cooked, and flavourful. Set atop a beautiful mash, parsnip and fresh local mini heirloom tomatoes. Still, so very full, a dessert must be tried upon the first visit. Chocolate mousse and caramel? Why yes, yes I shall. A nice balance of bitter and sweet, given my general dislike for the stupidly sweet chocolate concoctions so often featured on desert menus, this was a welcome relief.Ahh, but I forget to mention cocktails. The two samplings of the evening I tasted were the Moscow Moose(Mule), and The Concord Grape. The Moscow Mule was done exceptionally, no points for creativity, but full points for to the book execution. The concord grape reminded me of Welch's as a kid, except alcoholic. A wonderful thing if you are a boozing 8 year old. A interesting nostalgia 2 decades later. While it didn't pair at all with the deer, and I should have had wine, it was surprisingly welcome with the dessert."

The food was AMAZING. My dad ate the boar (one of the specials) and loved it. My surf and turf was great, but I wished I'd had the boar. Get that if it is on the menu.

You might wake up the next day with slightly hipster-esque grainy-style photos whose subject you can barely see. Your excuse? It's all in the name of fun, babe. All in the name of fun.If, like me, you liked l'Orignal before, you'll love it now. The food was always great - hello, spicy tuna tartare? But now, hold on. It's amazing.My friends and I had, well, the tuna tartare to begin. It's been on the menu for years and it should stay there forever. It went too fast for me to even think of taking a picture. Next, I had the miso marinated black cod (with tamarind, celery root puree, sautéed shiitake mushrooms and Braz potatoes in a mushroom broth). Seriously delicious. The juicy black cod flaked off perfectly and the celery root puree and mushrooms were a wonderful complement to the fish's miso marinade.One friend had the deer stew with root vegetables, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and whipped Brillat Savarin with a herb crust. Previously sold as a special, this dish was so highly rated by customers that it worked its way up and achieved menu status. And really, this isn't a stew you've had before. It was bursting with flavour and had great texture - the potatoes were silky, the root vegetables were grilled al dente, and the deer was deliciously tender.The other had the pan-seared scallops with a butternut squash puree, Brussels sprouts, and a tomato-bacon-yuzu tobiko vinaigrette. The scallops were fresh and grilled to perfection - they weren't the least bit gummy. The vinigrette added a welcome slightly-smoked flavour.And dessert? Yes please. A white chocolate crème brulée and a pecan-bourbon pie big enough for 2. Nothing crazy, but both were mmmmm and neither was too sweet, thank you.We finished with a couple of drinks at the bar with the über-fun crowd l'Orignal attracts. It's great - people just start talking to each other. None of the ""im-staring-at-you-but-will-keep-awkwardly-standing-far-away-because-I-have-no-game"" bull. People are nice.

It was not their fault that I had to fight my way past obscenely loud and drunk patrons down the stairs and into the coat area. We did, however, have to wait about five minutes, standing around with these super loud people who were talk/shouting to each other because there was no host person and we couldn't figure out who worked there.When someone finally came by, they invited us to sit by the bar until our table became available. It was another lonely five minutes before someone came by to drop off a drink menu.By the time our table was available, I was already pretty tired of all the loud patrons, the crappy music, and hoped that we would be seated by people who didn't feel the need to shout to their friends sitting across from them - we weren't that lucky :(It was late and packed, so by this point, I just wanted to order, eat, and go. We decided to share our starter, the pork terrine (with pistachios and figs, red cabbage and daikon radish cole slaw) and get our own mains. The pork terrine and the slaw was fantastic! It calmed me down a bit and helped me regain some of the patience I had lost earlier. Our mains came - I had the elk steak with mini bok choy on beans with some type of salsa with chorizo.

Double baked cheese curds with wild mushrooms, kale salad and bread plate to start. All thoughtfully, no exquisitely prepared. Smoked duck leg and Montreal half chicken for the mains to share between three were superb. Libations included Hendricks gimlets followed by the 2011 Philipe Cambien Chateuneuf du Pape.They have created something very special here. Go and be charmed."

The restaurant was understaffed and accommodating reservations appeared to be a regular issue.  At this price point, it was unacceptable and the servers were too overworked too care.  I would not return to this restaurant and would not recommend it to others. Two stars for the entrée quality and décor."

The menu is nit very big but i could have easily ordered any of the dishes as they all sounded good. For dessert we had an apple crumble which was nice and warm with a scoop of whisky ice cream on top. The whole bill came to $166 plus tax and tip. We each ordered 2 drinks each, so for all that the price is very reasonable for the area. Our waiter was extremely friendly and took his time explainable all the specials and was always there right when we needed anything.

Second, I ordered the bison burger dish, and when it came, it had an additional ingredient that was not listed in the menu. That ingredient was bacon! While it might like look a bonus, we do not eat bacon. The waitress apologized for the mistaken in the menu. When asked for a replacement, she said that it will take forever to cook a burger without bacon and we should choose a replacement. Third, when it came for desserts, we ordered tea and the s'mores dessert. The tea arrived but the dessert never came. Later, the waitress came with the bill. When we asked for the dessert, she apologized and said that her first language is not English and she did not think we ordered a dessert.

I've been to a lot of restaurants where i've looked at the pictures on the website, thought the food looked great and was then very disappointed by the presentation and flavor, however this place was not like that at all. The menu had a lot of great items, however we decided to go with the off-menu tasting which was recommended by the bartenders at Taverne Merchant Royal (owned by the same restaurant group - also a great place). In total we had 7 courses: 1. 4 Oysters2. The green salad3. Foie Gras Tourchon4. A tomato salad - I think this was a special5. Bison Tartare & Duck Smoked Meat6. Guinea Fowl 2 ways - the special that night7. Deconstructed S'moreEvery course was great, however the Duck Smoked Meat was probably one of the best things I've had in my entire life! The meat was perfectly prepared and the different bits that came with it made it even better. If you go with the tasting menu, you won't be disappointed, however I highly recommend the Duck Smoked Meat if it's available. Desert was also great, but we were too full to eat it all.Service was great, the waitress was very friendly and explained every course and also the wine tastings they had selected to go with my meal(s).

She didn't take initiative to take our order and it's hard to grab her attention. In spite of the bad serving experience, the food tastes gross too. Hamburger is the most easiest and regular food to cook, but it taste disgusting. The meat is not well cooked and smells stinky. We ask them to recook the meat and they bring the food back again it still smells fishy. My boyfriend only takes a bite and pay the check. The speed is really slow too. It took them an hour to bring our dishes. If you are hungry, don't choose this restaurant. We decided to leave and have something in other restaurant. The price is expensive.

Everything is with a heavy hand. I ordered the halibut but it was dry. The flavor of the fish was overpowered by the peppers and the artichoke was so overdone that all the taste was lost. We arrived at 7:30 and the restaurant was quiet enough for conversation but then it became full and I couldn't even have a conversation and asked for the bill. Too bad disappointed

I saw a fish item that was supposed to be served with ""eggplant sauce on top of tumeric pita and with israeli salad"". After a long wait, the waiter informed us that they burned the pita and had to remake it, and assured me ""it will be worth the wait"". When it finally arrived, the pita was again dry and simply awful, the eggplant sauce was nothing but bagabanoush, and israeli salad was tabuleh. Except for the fish fillet, which was simple but nice, you can get the rest much much tastier at any middle-eastern street vendor! For much less than $30!!! The waiter was nice and tried to make up by offering free desert and a drink for me (sadly i do not drink :-\).My partners dish was a pork chop, and it was tasty but extremely fatty, like the rest of the main dishes on the menu. We ordered the free desert that was supposed to be whiskey-soaked cake. The cake was tasty, but they had covered the whole thing with a massive amount of whipped cream, so we could barely get to the cake. Everything else on the desert menu was also extremely heavy so we could not find anything.Overall, the menu is limited, the service slow, and the food not that good. Simply not worth the money."

Perfectly cooked scallops sitting among pickled-this and fruity-that--it was a really fun dish. My husband had deer steak (also a special) served with hummos and chick peas--great combination. The smoked duck was the highlight for me. It was so many flavors: tender smoky meat, soft mustardy something-or-other on top, pickle, crunchy rye.

Next was the local snow crab chilled on ice with an amazing warm herb butter in a dish to dip which was almost not needed because the crab was so sweet! Crab was cut so we didn't make a mess extracting it. For mains I had the braised Venecin that was perfectly cooked with Brussel sprouts and fried caramelized pasta on the side. The meat was not gamey and was very delicious. I liked how it was under salted so you could taste the true flavor of the meat but others may say otherwise. My wife had the truffle pumpkin risotto which was also fantastic.  Could have used more pumpkin but overall amazing. Service was on point and the ambience/decor was outstanding. Some mentioned that the music was too loud but it was just fine up until I left at 9:30. Would highly recommend! Make reservations as its a small place and fills quick!

It was very intimate as you walk in with its candlelit dark interior and original stone walls and woodsy cabin-like feel.  The menu featured traditional Quebecoise cuisine (fish, game meats and top local products) and a fresh oyster bar.  They also have a late night menu which features poutine which I must try!"

/user_details?userid=IVBRRAOwAPiFhN2815UK_A,Pamela S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3 star rating,"L'Orignal was our third choice after we were unable to dine at two other restaurants due to Quebec's absurd liquor laws (not unlike Utah) that do not allow children to dine if the restaurant can serve people drinks without ordering food. I think that I have just eaten at too many great restaurants and they are all starting to seem the same to me. I think I need to return to much simpler, rustic fare to be re-inspired. We were seated promptly and our waitress was very nice and attentive. We started with New Brunswick oysters and the foie gras appetizer. I loved rye bread that accompanied the apps and creamy, curdy cheese underneath the foie gras was heavenly, as was the apple bacon chutney on the side of the plate. I probably should've just had a salad from there and called it good. For entrees, my husband got the pork chop special, which he enjoyed but the top of it was overcooked and dry. My daughter and I split the surf and turf which had beef instead of elk that night, with lobster salad & cabbage three ways. The steak was excellent. The lobster was barely discernible in too much mayo and the pureed red cabbage had too much vinegar. Hubby and daughter split the s'more dessert with meringue, chocolate fudge and graham cracker. They enjoyed it but it was too sweet for me. I guess I just expect to be more wowed when paying nearly $300 for dinner.

The entrance is just off Rue Notre Dame, on a narrow side street. Walking down the stairs, you enter into a true Quebecois restaurant. L'Orignal, which means ""moose"", is decorated like a hunting lodge, with moose heads, wooden floors and walls, old-timey knicknacks and dimly lit with candles. At 11 PM, the dining room was still buzzing with activity, but it wasn't hard to get a table. The late night menu includes oysters on the half shell, tuna tartare, mini burgers, mac and cheese, and poutine. I chose to start with a selection of six oysters, from PEI and Massachusetts. Served simply with lemon and a little ground horseradish, they were perfectly fresh and briny. I followed that up with a hearty portion of mac and cheese, dense with cheddar and sprinkled with chopped scallions. My wife had the tuna tartare, wonderfully balanced with avocado and a punch of chili and ginger. Overall service was fast and attentive, and the drinks were nice and strong. Fortunately for us, we were staying right around the corner. We definitely will be back to try the full dinner menu."
