I looked it up on Yelp, and decided on the list of things I wanted to try! Read here that it's BYOB and that sealed the deal. Ordered the French Onion Soup & a Small White 5 Cheese Pizza to share with the husband. Quality of ingredients was excellent!! We are in love with cheese, and the amount and type of cheese in the Soup & on the Pizza was a literal dream come true! The portions are huge, so these two items were more then enough for us and we ended up taking a few slices home!  The ambiance and service were a 10/10. Would definitely recommend this spot to everyone. Definitely worth making the effort to this part of the town for dinner! P.S. It's Cash Only."

Amelia's is a busy little family style owned restaurant in Montreal that is a BYOB policy! It's tucked in more on a side street than a usual busy street. We walked in on a Thursday night and they were packed, luckily we were able to get one last table to accommodate the 5 of us. This cheese ravioli dish was everything! This dish was made to perfection, my friend and I shared the dish and honestly I wish I got my own because it was just soo good! The pizza on the other hand didn't appeal to me as much, I've definitely had better bbq chicken pizza. The breading was personally a little too dry for me. But overall, cute little restaurant where id definitely recommend the cheese ravioli!"

We called for takeout and were told it would be ready in 25 minutes. We were there 20 minutes later, ended up waiting for another 20 mins. We finally had our overpriced pizzas 50 mins after we called. There were no apologies, just indifference by the staff."
/user_details?userid=TyRRSckAsEKbqDoXG5n1nQ,Michella L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So I'm long time Amelias fan . There are many tourists in this area and I often tell people looking for restaurants on the street I will stop and suggest they go to Amelias. I'm definitely sad I have to write this bad review. But they need to do better so I'mDoin it ;).To my dismay the last two times I was there I was rrushed and told my server was leaving . PoLitely I might add but I it's the second time we were pushed out . The visit before it was a very busy night and the inexperienced waiter kept asking if we were done and obviously wanted us out for the next table . A bit more professionalism is needed here . Another strange thing is when we walked in last night the cook  from behind the kitchen glared At us with no smile in the eyes . I said hello because he was looking right at me and he continued to glare no words ( he's obviously not the greeter then lol ) Then we stood there while the staff was doing other things and we had to say hello first . Kind of uninviting right from the start . Waitress was friendly but no suggestions ,no have u been here before , very rushed .So the food . Wow I feel incredibly sad to write This because  the lasagna here is very great ! Don't ever order regular pasta at Amelias  . I had rose Fusillli , and French onion soup .M'y French onion was extremely salty but  good as French ooinion soup goes . The bread we were served was burnt a lot very hard . Fusilli was so watery and bland . Had no creamI had to put a lot salt because there was clearly none at all in my dish  . It was pretty bad .I waited for this all week and I could have made myself  better pasta . Then we were told waitress wasdone her sshift and she gave us thE bill . I think you need to step up your game Amelias. Don't loook so freakedout that you are busy .it shows . If u hire students , train them on the basics of hospitality .Salt and parm goes in rose sauce to finish .mr glare from the kitchen ..Overrated , I'm disappointed and not going back unfortunately."

I was so excited because I love ravioli, but this dish left me hungry for a lot more flavor. It was so disappointing to eat this last because everything I received beforehand was so yummy!I also ordered the French onion soup as a side (about $6.75)-- Wow wow WOW!! Amazing. You might not even need a main dish after this soup. Then, I had no idea but when you order a pasta dish (or probably any dish) you also get fresh hot bread with a side salad! The soup, bread and salad were my favorite parts.ALSOOOOO, this is a BYOW restaurant, so do that. It makes the experience even more fun. Overall though, we were seated quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. I was so happy we found this little Italian restaurant (-:"

You descend these little stairs and you're welcomed by the lovely smell of pasta and pizza.Looking at their menu, I love that they offer you the choice of spinach vs white pasta. It's such a change because you usually never get to choose.I ordered the spinach pasta with meat sauce and my friend ordered the lasagna. We shared both and it was so delicious! Their lasagna is so cheesy, warm, comforting, and filling. Their spaghetti tastes fresh and the meat sauce is so well made. I don't like that they are cash only but at least the ATM fees are just 1.95$.A great place for a date, a friend lunch/dinner, a family meal, or a solo adventure!"

They also do a delicious complimentary salad to start, which I am usually very excited about. I have tried their lasagna, arrabiata ravioli and baked eggplant. Really like everything but baked eggplant has won my heart! I always recommend this place to my out of town friends when they visit Montreal. Very reasonably priced menu. The service is great, never been disappointed. It gives a very homely and cozy vibe. The only drawback is that they don't accept any other payment tenders except CASH. So if you're like me who doesn't carry cash, make sure you do. They do have an ATM there."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here a couple weeks ago and it was seriously the best meal I've had in 2018 so far! I've had my eye on Amelia's for a few months now and finally dropped in for a dinner date on a Friday night. We arrived around 7 and waited around 15 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we were warmly greeted by our waitress and were given an ice bucket for our wine (BYOB!). I knew beforehand that I wanted the famous white cheese pizza and hubby created some concoction of his own. Within minutes, we were given the side salads which were delicious and a welcome balance to the carb/fat overload that was to come. Despite the restaurant being jam packed, service was quick and we got our pizzas in no time.Honestly, I have never tasted a pizza SO amazing in my life (well maybe except for the stuffed pizza in Chicago..) - the crust was buttery and flakey and just soooooo good you wanted to die and live inside it. The cheese mix was phenomenal... and by some stroke of genius, they managed to make this pizza not so heavy that you felt gross afterwards. So so so soooo good!20 stars overall! Amazing food, ambiance and prices! Will 1000% be back and if you haven't been yet, I'm not sure what you're waiting for! Go! Now!! And bring me a slice back with you :D"

They deserve around of applause due to having the best pizza in Montreal!-quality Ingredients -unique If you're a pizza fan and are fed up with that cardboard crust and cheap cheese then give them a ring! The white pizza (Blanca) is out of this world (my personal fav) The amount of cheese they put on this lovely pie is super and they mix it with cheese of course, I can see why it's the most popular.The Reuben is so unique I've yet to have anything like this i was craving smoked meat and boy did they deliver plus they give to types of sauces mustard and a sweet mayo which is hard to beat.You will be extremely full but you will be overly satisfied."

I had French onion soup and all dressed medium pizza. I noticed others having five cheese. I think it's their specialty. My friend knowing my taste told me it is too heavy for both of us. So I avoided it and kept wondering is it good? I like their bread, perfectly toasted. The French onion soup was one of the best. The pizza had too much sauce inside so that the dough was too wet to my taste. They offer complimentary salad. Yummy. This place is BYOW. Very good."

Don't get me wrong - it's good pizza, but more Canadian style: thick, almost shortcrust pastry crust, with heavy, cheddary cheese on top of the toppings, and lots of sweetness. I can't say it was my style, though. If you like thick pizza, perhaps it's for you!We did get a nice, generous side-salad as part of the meal cost though - that was very nice. I do feel like this place (considering that it's in, or near, the McGill ghetto) is more for students! And for students, it's very good."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Amelia's pizza. A classic Montreal BYOB Italian restaurant in the heart of the McGill ghetto - and somehow I hadn't tried it until recently! DROOL! Their food is literally dripping in ooey-gooey cheese goodness. We went for #Pizzafestmtl, and after reading that this place always has a line-up, we were surprised that the restaurant was relatively empty at around 7pm on a Thursday evening. After maybe 15 minutes though, it started to get crowded so I think we just got lucky with the timing.The service was efficient and our water was always topped off. They serve warm bread (just one bread for 2 people though?! That was weird...), and a carrot, cabbage and lettuce salad with Italian dressing before your food arrives.We ordered the small white pizza (5 cheeses) and the baked vegetarian lasagna. Their food does not disappoint. The pizza and lasagna are very decadent and filling (we took 1/3 of the food home with us). I loved the flavour and texture of their dough, and the fact that the sauce used in the lasagna isn't your average tomato sauce. They used eggplants to liven up the sauce and it was a delicious success. Everything is made to order and is bursting with flavour.The funniest part was the fact that they have parmesan shakers on each table, as if anyone's going to need extra cheese!! Let's just say we went on a really long walk back home in an effort to burn some of the caloric goodness we had just inhaled.Please note that it's cash only but I was prepared thanks to all the Yelp reviews. It cost around $40 for 2 people. I will for sure be going back for a BYOB dinner the next time I'm craving comforting Italian deliciousness."

The second you walk in, you feel like you're walking into a Nona's dining room, it's inviting, comfortable, and cramped. We ordered two pizzas (artichoke and italian sausage) and the meat lasagna. The artichoke pizza was creamy, unlike any pizza I'd ever had, fantastic! the Italian sausage was spicy, with a very sweet tomato sauce - possibly sweetened with sugar. the lasagna had almost no beef in it, despite it being a ""meat lasagna"". Overall, great little spot, but could have been better. The artichoke pizza is a must have, everything else is standard fare."

I went here a while back with my husband and some friends. Our waiter was very accommodating and i could feel that genuinely wanted to serve us well and make sure we have a good time. I ordered the lasagne, and was left astounded by how perfect it was. There was flavor, texture and a whole lot of cheese (yay!)They also served us a little simple salad before our main course which I happened to try (I normally skip salads when I have a heavy main course coming). I enjoyed every bit of it and infact recreate the same at home often. I'm already excited to go there again and I would be lying if I say I didn't already decide what I want the next time I visit, the same night I dined here. Kudos to this place and the staff! Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."

Took the artichoke pizza,it was delicious and creamy. They only had one size for those specialty pizzas,it was 10 inch,and i though it was going to be small,but to my surprise it was enough food. There was lots of cheese on it and it wasn't overly salted.It came with a green salad,which helped on the digestion.simple and not overly sauced.We also took fettuccine alfredo,i found that plate just average,it was a bit small.Ordered a side of meat balls,was pretty good,the sauce was a tad bit sour for my liking.Byob which is a great add on,and lastly service was excelle t.Would recommend going to this place if u want pizza dt!!"

/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"I visited Amelia's in late July with my husband and his family. We ordered two large pizzas for our group; the vegetarian and the five cheese. The service was timely (we were after all their only customers at the time) and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The pizzas however were just OKAY.It's not that they weren't good, but rather Amelia's slightly greasy pizzas stand at the border between fast food and proper restaurant food. They're good, but as I chewed through the fat, the fluffy crust and the cheese, I couldn't help but feel the same way as when I order a pizza from Pizza Pizza; doubtful of my dietary choices, and wondering if I might have gotten a better deal in terms of quality for the price elsewhere (the answer is ""yes"", especially if you are hungry for real Italian pizza). Amelia's serves American pizza. That's alright, so long you don't expect high quality food. It's good, but not great. I wouldn't backpedal if I was invited for dinner, but I will avoid going back again by myself."

Even so, this place is well known and mostly full as it has limited tables and seats. No reservation and cash only, but they serve excellent pizza. I especially enjoyed their chicken BBQ gourmet pizza, which was a little on the sweet side. Gourmet pizza are only served in one size, large enough for two unless you are famish. And if you have leftover, they will be happy to put them in a box, why waste an excellent food when you can finish the rest at home. Definitely worth a visit or just order to go, expect to wait though."

You know, in the name of science.Well while at Amelia's the smells wafting around us inspired an order of vegetarian lasagna in addition to a medium mushroom pizza. Again, for science.Though we remain loyal to the greasy, ubiquitous goodness of NYC pizza, we've got to give it to Amelia's for creating a cozy environment with friendly service and very tasty food. We'll be using this data for future studies."
/user_details?userid=XPAJ2KHkCwBA0vafF-2Zcg,D S.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Very unassuming place from the outside, it was right across the street from where I was staying, on a Saturday there was a huge line around 7pm, thought maybe it was a bar. Looked it up and to my delight a very well rated italian resto!Ordered takeout, eggplant parm/vegie lasagna/white pizza. Their white pizza looked amazing, got great reviews, so i went with that. Walked into the place and was instantly hit with the sweet sweet smell of an AMAZING Italian food kitchen. You only get that smell at primo places, I was happy before even getting my food.Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY. Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing this on their website nor menu, But their is an ATM there.The food is AMAZING, everything tasted great, was so damn delicious. The pizza is the unique offering -  IMO I think they use a shortening in their dough which gives the crust a semi semi puff pastry texture/flavor. It was really unique and appreciated, and especially on the white pie it went very well.I would come from anywhere in the city to eat here, but if you're staying at the Trylon appts across the street this is a big plus being so close.Great job Amelia's, please open another location in Toronto!"

/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Amelia's looks like a neighbourhood place to get a slice of pizza but I found it wholly lackluster. The pizza has an incredibly thick crust that doesn't have a lot of flavour. I love a good Hawaiian pizza but this one came with maraschino cherries inside the pineapple slices?? The service was very mediocre and they didn't take cards which meant I had to get cash out from the atm located awkwardly in the middle of their restaurant. Paying $20 for a personal sized pizza with minimal flavour and toppings is not my idea of a good meal. Would not recommend for people who are pizza lovers and for those who enjoy bold flavours.
/user_details?userid=A6hxEDVE0vPkK2p0QnpQIQ,Liesl B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (Amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when I was at university so I can you that not only is the food DELICIOUS, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. I thought they'd closed down so I was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as Amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! I love supporting local companies and this is the real deal.Now on to the food! There's a reason that every crop of McGill students learns of Amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple. Not only are the prices reasonable, it's BYO and group-friendly for before a big night out. It was not uncommon when I worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life. Now I happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. The white pizza (5-cheese) is a MUST. I highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely TO DIE FOR. You must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices & garlic for even more flavour. Just adding mushrooms is another fav. The Florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors. Only available as a small, so bear that in mind! The vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant. The Reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure. If you're a first-timer I'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though. Or the White :)You really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier. They aren't intended to be Italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that. The crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (I believe they use Crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a New York style slice. I almost never eat crusts from pizzas but I always finish theirs, they're so good!! The little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! And their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. If you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house.Note that it's cash only, so come prepared! One of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at Cinema Du Parc. They stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly.You will have an awesome meal, promise :)"

I went with 3 friends we ordered 2 large pizza's and we couldnt finish them although they were super good. The price might be slightly high (about 15 $ for a small one or 25 for a large one) but the quality is worth it and as a starter you get a free salad that is nicely seasoned and really helps you to start your meal on the right foot. Also the atmosphere is very nice. Overall not cheap but a great choice for a bussniess or friend gathering meal.
/user_details?userid=8GWMGkLOim6U8Ur3oiB2KQ,Chaim K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Food is ok at best. $30 for a large pie and $15 for a pasta is slightly (or very) over priced. Then they hit you with cash only when the bring you a receipt... and that where the trouble really begins. We left enough for the bill and a small tip, considering that was all the Canadian cash we had on us (didn't want to pay to use their cash machine and give them more undeserved money). We definitely covered more than the bill. As we were leaving the restaurant, the waitress runs after us and says we didn't leave enough. We get in and it seems the money disappeared. It was clear that money was lost/stolen and they tried to take it out on us. When we refused to pay, the owner told us that this will be taken out on the waitress. I couldn't let that happen and they wouldn't exchange US money with me. I ended up giving the waitress $20 US seeing as the owner was willing to take it out on her and I felt bad. But that was really bad treatment of their customers and their staff. As we were leaving someone else who witnessed the story said that the same thing happened to them before. It seems that since they only accept cash they skim a bit off the top and then tell you that you didn't leave enough. I would suggest staying far away from this place. The food is half decent but they are willing to steal from their customers and fight with you after."

And then they bring you fresh warm bread (even more yum). GO FOR THE PIZZAThis is why I have given the 4 star review. Their pizza is amazing, fresh and just such a treat - the portion are perfect too. Their pasta is nothing to give 4 stars over so just skip that part of the menu. Amelias is perfect for a date, or anything really. The atmosphere is warm and incredibly friendly. Just a heads up though - it's cash only!"

/user_details?userid=5wgt_K5YtG8Vjmca4nJx0w,Aaron B.,"Silver Spring, MD",2 star rating,"Good food, rude service (except for the waiter), way too expensive.  When we arrived they refused to sit us because we were waiting on two people. More than half the tables were empty on a Wednesday at 8pm.  There was no chance they would fill up by the time our entire party arrived.  The waiter was nice but did not refill our water at all.  The pizza was good with lots of cheese but certainly not worth the price.  When we went to checkout the guy was pretty rude and took forever to give us our change.  Also, how is such an expensive restaurant cash only? They can easily afford a credit card machine and should have one for $30 pizzas."

/user_details?userid=7eHfZUHxun1Al3W2lEAc1g,Alex N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"REVIEW FROM 2013/ AMELIOS: POSITIVE  Best pizza in Montreal, hands down!. Title says it all. Try the 5 cheese pizza, you won't regret it - one of the best things I've ever eaten! The pasta is very good too. Waiting for a table seems to be the biggest ""problem"" at Amelios so go early since they don't take reservations, won't seat a group until everyone has arrived and since they close early! Cash only."

We ordered the club pizza as well, but it left a little to be wanted and didn't disappear as quickly.  I would give a 3.5 if I could, but take points away for being cash only."
/user_details?userid=E8vKpkKTX4GGzxPPuxr77Q,Sum Wan F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,By far the best pizza I tried in montreal and I would recommend it for everyone but beware... the owner is one of these cranky guys that doesn't smile to anything ..not even to kittens and puppies. Stay away from him

/user_details?userid=Zucs57W4fArzKIJ9783dfw,Aryan Y.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Delivery order to Parc and Mont-Royal here. Made an order after everybody had talked about the old Amelio's that this place was. After 1:40 hrs since the phone call, I had to call in and cancel the order. Apparently, the delivery guy was ""on his way"" for 45 min. For a typically 6-7 min drive, that's far too much. On this night, Parc avenue was closed for a marathon, and hence I would totally understand being a bit late. But, being in that traffic earlier, it shouldn't have added no more than 10 min to the drive. It was completely unacceptable. Since no money was exchanged, it was a painless cancellation order, though."

/user_details?userid=rSMT33T_rX8iwP-JwTerhw,Sumone Y.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Was known as Amelio's. Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened
/user_details?userid=wXKnz_CLGDVzkA531JUmow,Maureen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amelio's has reopened as Amelia's and my life is complete! When asked what my favourite casual restaurant/meal is, the answer is, hands down, Amelia's. To the person who posted that this was possibly the best pizza in all of the province, I'd like to offer that it is probably the best on the continent. The pizza is the best, period. It's served hot (and that isn't as obvious as it sounds), the vegetables are fresh, and the side salad is crisp, with a tangy vinaigrette. If you opt for the subs, the vegetarian sub is chock full of fresh fare, not the stock green peppers and lettuce but rather eggplant and zucchini. As for their tomato sauce, I'm sure it's illegal. Whatever the secret ingredient is, it's kept me loyal since I discovered the place (as Amelio's) in 1994. Only caveat: I wish they were open on Sundays and Mondays! They don't take plastic, but there's a cash machine on the premises. They also serve Dr. Pepper in a can...the only way to drink soda! I wish I could give Amelia's SIX stars!"
