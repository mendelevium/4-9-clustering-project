Nevertheless, amazing seafood and desserts."

Makro is a fish restaurant for people who don't necessarily go out of their way to eat fish. It's beautifully upscale with a great candlelit atmosphere, an attentive service, a huge wine list and a whole array of seafood and fish dishes. I had spicy tuna tartare (a absolute must, since it replicates a true tartare texture), seabass, Brussels sprouts with parmesan, fried yuca and a delightfully light mille-feuilles with some Spanish sweet moscatel. Despite being a fish sceptic I very much enjoyed all of the dishes, and even sampled their ribs, which were cooked to perfection much like their fish offering. I especially recommend this place for a very fancy date. Definitely dress up for the occasion!"

Hats off to the staff for being hygienic and offering first class service. Our waitress Jennifer was an amazing person and worker. She took care of us with lots of love. I really appreciated for her attention to details. I started with a cocktail Un Poco Si, mix of patron reposado, passion fruit, jalapeño and calvados, which was refreshing with spice. One of the best cocktail I have enjoyed after very long time. We shared an entrée of Esquite de la maïs. Delicious, spicy and zingy, otherwise perfect. Then my sister had a baked salmon with green beans and white beans; it was perfectly cooked, and it was super succulent. I had the grilled octopus, which was divine! In between, the main meals, we had this amazing a flavorful salad de Talla. Each dish was stunningly presented, and the flavors were bursting , and making you excited to enjoy the meal. Overall, the restaurant, the food and the service were perfect! Definitely 5 stars without a doubt!"

Perfectly done with delicious chimichurri sauce. Drinks are great too.  The terasse is open during summer! Enjoy!"

Personally, I didn't think this place blew my mind. The vibe was nice, on the upscale side which if you know me well enough, I always appreciate. But I did not feel like the food reflected the price. It was passable but not worth for me to drive an hour. What I can tell you is that @makromtl service is definitely attentive and our waitress Vanessa did everything possible to make our evening pleasant- she definitely deserves recognition. Since we were a party of 25 people, we were asked to pick a group menu. After trying my main dish, Vanessa asked me what I thought about my dish. As I was previously advised by other chefs in other restaurants, it is always important to speak up if you are not satisfied about certain thing, so I did. Now it wasn't a question of getting a free meal, and perhaps they knew that one of the reasons why I was there was to write a critic- But honestly, I was willing to give Makro one last chance. Instead of $55.00 I was willing to pay over $100, just to see if I was the one who was really missing anything. Because you know, your girl can always be wrong.I asked Vanessa to suggest me the best item on the menu and she recommended the grilled octopus. Charred and super tender, but did this one last dish made the cut? Again, it was good but not outstanding. If I wanted to go somewhere for seafood, maybe i'd go to Milos instead. Have you guys been to Makro? If so, how was your overall experience?PS. Vanessa, if you see this- I want to deeply thank you for your patience and hospitality. YOU deserve a 5 star for your service."

The waitress was super friendly and helpful. Thank god she suggested the taster menu for 60$ a person. We got to try out so many items from the menu, it was great!Food was excellent, quality was great you really get your moneys worth. We were scared to run out of food but they just kept the plates coming! I realized that they don't always suggest the taster menu and have some friends that had bad experiences there but definitely ask about it. So worth it! Everything was so delicious"

The staff is really friendly, the drinks are really good (especially their Clamato) and their seafood is fresh. I've had the oysters, shrimp, crab, octopus and lobster and all were delicious! The music is really good too and their terrace is perfect in the summer"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was excited to come to this restaurant because I really do like Grinder. This restaurant is located where Shinji used to be before it closed down. I came here last night with my boyfriend at 7 pm. It got pretty packed around 8 pm. We sat at the bar. The waitress behind the bar asked us what kind of water we wanted right away. Because we were at such close proximity to the bar and to the waitress, I felt the service was very good and pretty fast. I ordered the Barracuda cocktail. It's basically a Bloody Caesar with jalapeño and an oyster on top. It wasn't spicy though. My boyfriend got the Mexican Chardonnay cocktail which consisted of cazadores reposado, martini sec, pineapple, mint and agave. It tasted lemony and not what I expected. It's a pretty drink and it's light. I think it's more a of a girl's drink to be honest. After that we had imported red wine. Mine was a Pinot noir and it was very good.  I wish the waitress had poured more of it because it didn't look like much in my glass.We started with the spicy tartare rice cake. Basically it's tartare on five rectangular rice beds. It was so yummy! We devoured it. I'm not sure what kind of fish it was. It didn't say on the menu and I didn't think to ask. Then we shared two mains - the lobster and the lamb. The waitress recommended to get seafood as she said that was their speciality  and si for those who like meat they should just go to grinder instead. So we got the lobster because she said it was her fave on the menu and we got the lamb because we are not big on fish. Out of the two mains I preferred the lamb. The lobster was very Asian influenced with xo sauce and bok choy, mango and puffed rice. I don't usually enjoy Asian fusion or Asian influenced dishes because I'm half Asian and I can eat this stuff for cheap in Chinatown.  I was surprised that the portions were big. The pieces of lobster were huge. And the lamb dish consisted of many lamb chops. The lamb chops were expensive! $70 for like 6 chops! The lamb came with pomegranates seeds , eggplant, sour cream, pico de Gallo and  mint leaves. My boyfriend felt the lamb lacked flavour and salt but with the sour cream and mint I felt it was quite tasty. I don't think I will be back. I like grinder so much more."

A beautiful spot to catch up with your swanky awesome friends? Yes indeed. Well, what can I say about this place? Had a fantastic dinner out - led to a downstairs secret hideaway bar that was super fun but did a tequila shot, turned into a pumpkin and had to go home. Oh hood in mamahood. But I will gladly do it again!!!! It was worth the pain and why we work hard - to enjoy life!"

Love the steak, the spicy tuna, and everything I've tried on the menu. I don't know where the bad reviews come from, maybe it's just growing pains. But we've had a great time every time we've come and the downstairs club is so much fun."

The decor leaves much to be desired as does the very over-priced menu. The food, once it finally arrived was mediocre.Would not set foot in there again even if someone else was paying.Choose to spend your money at a restaurant that truly cares about serving good food."

I highly recommend the tuna tartare rice cakes and the ocupus. Our server, Vanessa, was very kind and made great suggestions."
