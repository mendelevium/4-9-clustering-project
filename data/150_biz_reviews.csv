/user_details?userid=INsYmDEYGLImdSJUnxti_g,Fairooz K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Such a great find in the Mile End neighborhood of Montreal! La Khaïma provides a homely, authentic Moroccan meal experience at a reasonable price. We came here quite late right around the time when the kitchen was about to close, but the owner was very nice and seated us regardless. You have to take off your shoes to enter the seating area, and you sit on low benches under a canopy of artful tapestries hanging from the ceiling. For dinner, they serve a $25 per person fixed menu with 3 courses. Coming from New York, I found this a very affordable option for such a fun and delicious experience. For the first course, we were served a lentil soup and pita with mashed yams. The second course was a shared platter for two which included couscous and a variety of tagines - chicken, beef, vegetables, and lentils. The vegetables were very flavorful, the beef tender and fragrant, and the chicken with olives was also delicious. It was A LOT for two people, and we had to pack leftovers which was enough for dinner for two the next day. For dessert, it was a date and almond cake, and hot tea. They are BYOB, but I recommend the hibiscus drink that they serve, as it pairs very well with the food. The entire experience was very enjoyable, and great value for the price!Perfect for a casual girls' night out, date night, or dinner with family/friends. Would definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious and authentic Moroccan food. Great place to go with a large group of people as they are set meals provided on large serving dishes to share. I came here for a birthday party and we were seated in our own dining room. It was a really cool experience sitting on the floor in a tent-like lounge eating such authentic food. To start, we were given a pot of lentil soup. This dish reminded me of an Indian daal with similar spice blends. Needless to say, it was very comforting on a cold day. We were also provided with pita bread as well as a spicy tomato dish and a bean hummus. Those side dishes were also incredibly tasty. The main meal was served on a huge platter. It consisted of a beef dish, a chicken dish and a bean dish (veggie). This was all layered on a bed of couscous. I would love to go back to this restaurant to try these dishes again as I felt like the couscous made up the majority of the portion. However, the few pieces of meat that I got were delicious. The meat was so tender and tasted like it was being mixed in a stew full of spices for a while. Overall, for $25, the value is almost there. The couscous is great but there should be a more even balance or greater balance between the meats (main dishes) and the couscous. The experience, however, is amazing. I would definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Khaima is definitely the place to be if you want a local experience for authentically cooked northern African cuisine. This restaurant gets packed quick, so reservations from their website are a must. Once you enter the restaurant, you are asked to take of your shoes before entering the dining hall. The low tables and seating are a bit uncomfortable but you adjust to it with a few glasses of wine (BYOW must I say more? ). We opted for the table d'hote for 25$ per person that includes 1. pita bread with tahini (we got yogurt instead-that was disappointing) 2. lentil soup 3. a large plate with couscous, lemon olive chicken curry, beef with dates curry (my favorite), and a chick pea carrot curry 4. mint tea. You get full very quickly. I was very satisfied with my meal. This is a one of a kind for the Montreal scene you should definitely experience once if you can!"
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here Feb 2019 with my ACT colleagues in a group of 10, to enjoy sitting on the ground to eat, be merry n drink lotsa wine. Spirit: awesome! Tommy our waiter was amazing, he divulged to us at the end of the night it was his first night and we didn't even catch on he was new. He apologized for not being ""as good as (he) hoped"" which was like wtf? How on earth could u be better?! He even ninja-matrix styled a position to take group photos of us, so hellz yes! We made a point to let the lady running the place know: he's a keeper!EXCELLENT GROUP LOCATION! AYCE for 25$ plus tax, plus tip and it's a BYOW ...with delicious food, it doesn't get better than this!!!Food: SO GOOD, so worth the value for the price!!!!!!!! The way it works is they bring your whole group a huge pot of soup (and you can order more as wanted) and then they bring out 3 huge plates of the mains, again, you can order more as wanted. Then they bring large plates of dessert. Everyone in your group shares the large servings. It's all a set menu so there's not much choosing. The soup was like dahl soup, not quite as savoury but delicious nonetheless. Of note, my friend Dom wanted me to mention they do not provide salt or pepper on the tables (it woulda been nice with some fresh black pepper, but not a deal breaker that there wasn't any). Also, I highly recommend ordering abundant amounts of their hot sauce which is spicy and delicious and compliments the food perfect!!!! It was a bit of an issue at first, they didn't seem used to being asked for hot sauce, but they dug some up for us and we were pleased with the results, ordered much more of it. Mains: taberjines of Vegetarian, Chicken and Beef. All 3 served on a bed of delicious couscous. Beautiful spices, tantalizing sauces. If I'm being honest, the chicken was a bit dry and I discovered 2/3 of a whole carrot in the vegetarian one, but it was all delicious anyways. Special mention for the whole seedless green olives in the chicken taberjine, oh so fantastic!!Appearance: oh boy, looks can be, and are, deceiving. This is where they lose their star. Do not come here in winter or summer, you will regret it. If u do ignore this and come in winter *** bring a blanket, slippers with water resistant bottoms AND dress warm ***. In summer, wear as little as legally possible, I'm sure it's a sauna here in summer. Best times to go = autumn n spring. Point re decor: everything looks worn and haphazard and could use a really good refresh... It is comfy and quaint, but its bordering dilapitated. Tables and benches, again, in need of refurbish.There's a basement and 2 street levels dining rooms and we, unfortunately were on the street level side with the door. It was so extremely cold I used my sweater to keep my feet warm and my super huge scarf as a blanket. You may want to consider reserving the 'kitchen side dining room' or the 'basement dining room'. Take away points: come prepared for the climate, come in a group, bring lots of wine, come hungry, don't fill up on soup even though it's delicious, enjoy 'til you bust! I will totally be back and propose a UYE here! ...or maybe an OYE hint hint..."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"So it turns out that this restaurant is actually Mauritanian, more so than Moroccan or Egyptian. Upon walking in, they ask you to remove your shoes (good thing my sister had warned me). The seats are extremely low and unless you get the side with the wall behind you, there's no back support. The table is also low and in the way of where your legs go. VERY uncomfortable seating! Ladies, don't try to dress glamorously when you visit!! I did like the traditional vibes and tapestries hung on the ceiling.The owner is a tall, loud and beaming man, who bellows ""hi, how are you?"" with a smile when he spots someone new walking into his restaurant. I like the kind of attention he pays to his diners, but his sense of humour can be a little hard to read at times. As part of the $25 table d'hote menu, they brought out family style lentil soup, hummus, eggplant dip and pita bread for the appetizers. The hummus was too acidic, the pita bread was taken out of a bag and sliced, the eggplant dip was pretty good, and the yellow lentil soup was excellent. *Personally, I would skip the hummus/eggplant dips for the $5 extra each and stick to the soup & tagines for the $20 table d'hote*.They then served us 3 family style tagines with couscous; chicken with confit lemon & olives, beef, and vegetarian. The beef - while the least visually appealing, was the most delicious, with balanced flavours. The chicken was too acidic (though I loved the olives) and the vegetarian was too bland. The tiny bite-sized cake at the end was yummy and flavourful but the tea was WAY too sweet. They should bring the sugar on the side!I really love trying new experiences in Montreal, and while I had a good time, I didn't find the food to be worth $33. Maybe I would go back if I had a Groupon. I totally see why this place is popular if you're craving a unique experience in Montreal. Great place for groups & BYOB!"
/user_details?userid=bAG7y3qbpTv3hzIpx4Wf2g,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Wow. Just WOW! This is an experience like no other.The food is tasty and hearty, and the price is very reasonable, but it is the exemplary hospitality and cordiality I experienced here that surely will live in my memory for many, many years. A Mauritanian meal is a communal repast. You don't just eat by yourself, looking all forlorn. So when I showed up by myself for brunch, Atique, the gracious owner of La Khaima, took it upon himself to bring together a merry group to share the feast. What followed was an afternoon filled with merriment, gluttony, and new friendships. While the chicken tagine and the omelette are full of flavor, I would recommend accepting the special hot sauce they offer, to give the food that extra kick. The hibiscus tea is nice and refreshing, and a great way to finish up the fantastic meal. This restaurant has me quite captivated, and Atique and his staff definitely will continue to see plenty of me!"
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Alright so a friend of ours highly recommended this place as serving one of the top couscous she ever ate.As the pictures show, it's a very authentic looking restaurant (honestly, you feel like you're camping in a tent). You take your shoes off, as per tradition. I probably should've looked this up before, but I showed up in sandals and had to walk around barefoot... Not ideal but okay. The seating set-up was not the most comfortable: the table is very low and you basically have to bend your neck down to eat without making a mess. Still, I could've enjoyed our meal if it wasn't for the disappointment of the 25$ fixed menu. Start out with a bowl of lentil soup, which was good but really nothing to write about. Then couscous with 3 different stew (chicken, beef and vegetarian). Yes it was good, but I honestly found the ratio of couscous to stew to be off, especially since they also serve pita bread with the plate. And then... dessert! Right?Nope.No dessert. Not even a little piece of cookie or pastry. Sweet mint tea is the dessert. Not worth it."
/user_details?userid=90fyHymYCrcnfsAn7CDGXw,Stefanie R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Was disappointing. Food was forgettable. As vegetarian you get ""choice"" of one main which lacked flavour/spices. The starter was a lentil soup and hummus, both were drowning in oil. Dessert is a dry cake and tea.They were eager to get us out in the end but forgot we were still waiting for the tea. Felt bad for the waiter, he seemed to be by himself and the place was packed.One star for the experience which gets better because u can BYOW (that's another star)."
/user_details?userid=TyHP-hBXH6pZbPOACmnyKg,Vicki J.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"WOW my first time trying Moroccan/Egyptian food and it was delicious and the most wonderful experience!!! The live music talent was so entertaining. The food is family style. We had a big group so we got all 3 options... the beef, vegetable, and chicken plates. They started our meal off with hummus and pita bread. Ended the meal with minty sweet tea which I thought really hit the spot. I definitely want to come back next time I'm in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=6xfWX-LlDCN-PrGizG96TQ,Ani D.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",1 star rating,"We came in a group for a birthday dinner, we had reserved in advance but still had to wait upon arrival. We were seated in the basement area around a low set table, it was not heated so it was cold. We were greeted by our waiter, Tommy, who informed us on what we were going to be served. We were served hummus and lentil soup as an appetizer, chicken, beef and vegetable dishes as a main courses all flavourful but no wow factors. We were left over an hour and a half without receiving any dessert or any service whatsoever. When we had asked for dessert they brought us pineapple in hibiscus juice instead of the date cakes we were promised when we arrived. They obviously improvised it last minute, when we questioned the waiter about it he told us they were out of dessert and that he had a long night as the restaurant was quite busy. He then proceeded to go find some leftover dried corners of the cake (which I suspect were uneaten pieces from other clients) and some hibiscus juice, which honestly did not look appetizing (picture below).I don't care if it was a busy night for the waiter I am a paying customer and I should be treated as any other. If I am not to be served every course then I shouldn't have to pay the full price. When we discussed the price (25$ per person) he defended himself by saying it was all you can eat, which obviously not as we had no dessert!!! They offered no discount for the lack of dessert or poor service which is ridiculous. I do not recommend this restaurant as we grossly overpaid for what we received."

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love the concept of sharing food with a group of friends. If you're looking for a fun dinner experience and friendly service, then this is definitely a place worth a visit. The food is delicious and it's BYOB too so it won't break your bank. The decor is special too, so if you're looking to impress your date, check it out."
/user_details?userid=zbSBmoujGgIPuNWQcny14g,Rach N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Short version: I felt everything was average from service to ambience to food. I haven't written a review in awhile but I felt compelled too for La Khaïma. Once we arrived it felt very touristy. Make reservations online for dinner especially on weekends as it was busy on Saturday night @ 7:30 pm. Ambience unique? Yes. As nice as the website for the Resto? No. Is searing comfortable? Yes, unless you have very long legs. Do you mingle with other guests as the website suggests? No, everyone sticks with the people the came with. Were we rushed and were the servers rushed? Yes! Do you get to choose which dishes you get? No, it's a fixed prix and fixed dish menu. But if you're vegetarian or don't eat beef, you can get more of the other (lentils, beef, chicken). Does the food come out fast? Yes. Are there appetizers? Yes, one, lentil soup that anyone with any cooking skills could make at home. Is it worth $25/person + tax for the experience? In my opinion it is not. Is it relaxing at least? No, as they want the quickest turnover. Did I like the main meal? So-so, the chicken was very flavorful, the slow cooked beef and lentils not so much. The entire thali is covered in couscous (no alternatives). You eat family style which I don't mind but if you're starving or have a big appetite the portions are smallish (in my opinion). But you can fill up on couscous. Did we have dessert or wine? Nope Did we see people BYOB? Yes Is it romantic? Um, not sure as it is loud and we felt rushed and the scarves on the ceiling and sitting on low padded stools, er, is not as romantic as I envisioned. I would take your date somewhere quieter (and less expensive). Is it good for someone with dietary restrictions? No (except for vegetarians but they would not have much choice). Would I recommend it? No Would I go back? No, too many better restos and cafes to try in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=Aqtnyl-rhUZF_zxDXlf0sw,Partha M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Wow. I have never been to a Mauritanian restaurant before. The food is excellent. Three courses. Course 1 is basic - Hummus with pita. Hummus has some paprika on it. Course 2 for vegetarians was a lovely vegetable stew on a bed of Couscous. Course 3 was tea with cake. Reasonably priced and friendly service. Unique experience / need to take shoes off and also eat communally. I really recommend this place
/user_details?userid=akwt7cct8r6TagzXdAcOhA,Max A.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"Warm, friendly staff. Comfortable, low key atmosphere. Great food. Reasonably priced.I stopped in for takeout after sunset during Ramadan and the scene in this place was nothing short of beautiful."
/user_details?userid=7LwNP-TCe1-pevp6KjYIPQ,Dan G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I did not know what to expect from this African neighborhood restaurant.Upon entering the decor is authentic and tastefully done. I was surprised that we had to remove our shoes and seated on small benches on the floor. I am very tall and it was not very comfortable. (I saw they have real tables and chairs in the adjacent room...I will ask for that the next time)It was a fixed menu which included soup to start (tasty but luke warm. We shared a platter of the 3 main courses (beef, vegetable, chicken) served on top of couscous. The platter looked beautiful and all the dishes were tasty but I was looking for more authentic pronounced flavors. For dessert we were served little cookies with tea which once agin tasted good but was luke warm. I understand it was Mtl a Table and very busy but this is a chance for a restaurant to put their best foot forward. I will return to give it a second try to see if it will be better because the food WAS good and service of the owners was very friendly and caring.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here this past Friday on a little dinner date and found this place to be a super cute BYOW restaurant!Service is warm beyond words, and the menu is kept simple: only one option available which is the Table D'hôte consisting of baba ghanoush, hummus, lentil soup, and a mixed plate of chicken with olives, meatballs with dates and okra, and a vegetarian bean medeley (all over a generous bed of couscous). You then end with a piece of cake and mint tea all for $25!Ladies beware, seating is on cushions close to the ground and the tables are not tall enough for your legs to fit underneath so maybe forego the little skirts and dresses (I looked AWESOME sitting there with my legs  a meter apart and my scarf filling in the gap created by that and the fact that I was wearing a dress. Soooo not a classy look but there was no other way to be comfortable). Because of this uncomfortable seating arrangement, I am docking a star. Had the cushions been directly on the floor, the seating may have been more comfortable/versatile but the way it's set up is really uncomfortable. Anyway, I digress...So the food came and we were pretty happy with everything:Baba ghanoush: I don't like eggplant so this wasn't for me but hubby thought it was greatHummus: interesting - not your typical Lebanese hummus but good nonethelessMain plate: chicken was our favorite. I wasn't crazy about the meatballs because they were wayyyyyy too sweet and the vegetable medeley was goodDessert: you're given a little square of a hard and dry almond cake. It was terrible and so a star was docked here.All in all, great experience. Would we come back? Probably not but only because it didn't wow us enough! Definitely a cute little date spot though so great job on the ambiance.Oh, one last thing, there is NOTHING Egyptian about anything on the menu here so classifying it as Egyptian is pretty misleading. Otherwise, go check La Khaima out - it won't disappoint."
/user_details?userid=8FuiGfvx5S0_l_lJtDxUyg,Sarah J.,"Waterloo, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a really amazing place we found in Montreal. And I think it should be the best dinner we had in this trip. It's kinda of omakese in African style dish. Only $25/person. (It can actually be 2 meals)Including appetizers(soup and pita), main, dessert and tea. The appetizer was really amazing. They gave us the soup, and hummus with pita. The soup was really savoury. The hummus must be the best hummus I've ever had. And the pita was really soft like bread. After the appetizer, they offered a huge plate for the main dish, which has beef, chicken, and vegetarian beans. Each kind was tasty. The meat was not dry. They were savoury juicy and fluffy. The meat was either savoury with the gravy or inside itself. And the vegetarian beans was amazing as well. After the main dishes, they offer the desserts, not sweet, also with a pot of ginger tea. Although I don't like ginger too much, I finished the whole pot. It was a really amazing experience.The service was really good. They offer the service in the high pace. Very efficient and helpful."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"BYO in Mile End that I tucked into for a friend's bday dinner last week and couldn't have been happier to find myself in such a cozy port in the -30 storm. We sat in the shoes-off elevated area surrounded by big pillows beneath the billowing tapestries that patchwork the ceiling. Water was served in cool glass carafes, wine bottles popped, bowls of hot dahl served, and then giant stoneware dishes, one vegetarian, one chicken, one veal (which I didn't try but folks raved over.) The chicken was moist and slightly spicy and the vegetarian had lip smackingly good potatoes. After the meal we were served hot sweet mint tea that was a perfect kick back out the door into the cold. The restaurant was short staffed that night so the owner was cooking and serving and he did an amazing job juggling it all with a smile. We paid a flat $20 each plus tax which seemed like a fair deal for the massive mounts of meal and the great good vibes."
