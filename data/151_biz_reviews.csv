/user_details?userid=Q8c2eJhAYTE4MrLX8aEOkQ,Hannah H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I should mention that I am a chef and don't often take the time to write reviews, but I feel that this place merits a little bit more recognition. What a pleasant surprise! I ordered beef panang curry, mango salad, spring rolls, cheesecake, and didn't have a highest expectations, as I recognize that packing up the meal and delivering can impact the quality. The prices are on the higher side, but you are really getting what you pay for here. My beautiful meal was created by a chef that really understands what it means to balance flavour. Not an overly complicated presentation, but lovely. If I were to be ultra nit-picky, the mango salad could have been a little less sweet, and quality of the greens and cherry tomatoes in the side salad could have been higher considering they are in season right now, but otherwise this chef skilled and it really showed! I imagine it would have been even better in person, but definitely one of the best Thai takeouts I've had!"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"This one comes as a recommendation from a coworker who's been here before.  It's also very near to the hotel and looks like it has excellent outdoor seating!  Let's check it out.Atmosphere/Appearance: Attached to a hotel on the main strip of Rue Rene-Levesque Ouest is this gem.  You can walk right up the decorative stairs in the outdoor seating area complete with its own bar or you can walk into the main level to sit in that dining room, the choice is yours.  We wanted to sit outside to enjoy the great weather while we still had the chance.  The decor is so beautiful.  The restaurant is so fashion-forward and modern.  It's chic design is so clean and elegant.  I loved it.  It really felt like a place the ""in crown"" would totally be caught hanging out at.Service: Brandon was our server and I believe he was also the bartender.  He wore multiple hats and took excellent care of us.  He was personable, friendly, sweet, helpful and really allowed us to get to know him.  Good luck chasing your dreams if you're reading this dude.Food: I started off with some Duck Wontons.  I mean, duck is just THE thing to do in Montreal, right?  Right.  They were crispy, hot and super flavorful.  The menu describes them as confit duck, button andShiitake mushrooms along with green onion all deep fried inwonton wrappers then served with a plum sauce.  Delicious.  For my entree I went with the Seafood In Yellow Curry which is a concoction of shrimp, clams, calamari, scallops,long beans, cherry tomatoes, baby corn, bamboo shoots, kaffir leaves and Thai basil alll thrown together in a delicious coconut based curry sauce.  It was fantastic and I'd absolutely get it again.Value: All prices are in $CAD.  Duck Wontons = $13.00.  Curry = $27.50.  This is a bit more of an upscale Thai restaurant so I almost expected the prices to be a bit inflated, but they weren't horrible.  Come prepared to spend some cheese because this isn't one of those hole-in-the-wall spots.In conclusion I'm very happy my coworker recommended this place to me.  In ticked all of my boxes and made me a believer!"

The waiter first asked us when we sat down, if we prefer English or French? I wish I could have told her French. We ordered the lunch specials and our choice was either soup or salad, and unlimited rice!!!  As a result, we got a little bit of everything (see picture) and I would recommend to try your favorites.  This place definitely did not disappoint."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food and amazing service. We came here for MTL à table. We took the shrimp cakes as appetizers and they were ok but the vinaigrette was delicious and not too spicy. We took the braised pork belly and the yellow curry salmon. The curry was amazing and it complimented the rice well. The salmon was good but a but overcooked. The pork belly wad also good but not tender enough. For desserts, we tried both the cheesecake and the coconut chocolate bowl. The cheesecake was a bit too sweet. The coconut chocolate bowl was amazing and it looked great also. As for the service, our waitress was extremely friendly and had a great smile all the time. The place has 2 floors and is very clean and spacious."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Although the food was good, I didn't find that  enough flavour was incorporated into the dishes. I came here with some colleagues for a drink and dinner and the atmosphere was very inviting   The layout of the restaurant is really cool and very open. The service was very good and the staff were very friendly. As for the food, we shared imperial rolls, some puff pastry with chicken and we each got a meal.The imperial rolls tasted bland even with the fish dipping sauce/oil. I didn't care for them that much. The puff pastry tasted really good when dipping it into their sriracha dip. However, if it wasn't for the dip, the lack of flavour would've caused me to enjoy it far less.For my main, I got the Pad Seew. This dish was very good. However, again, the  lack of flavour really caused the dish to be not the most enjoyable. Also, some of the Chinese broccoli florets were way too big to eat with just a fork (knife was not given on the table setting). Overall, I don't think I would come back due to the lack of flavour. However, their drinks are really cool and unique and their staff are super friendly!"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were here while MTL a table event. I know about this place for some time but never been here. The menu is different than a regular menu. We had two appetizers shrimp cake, rainbow salad. Main dishes are pork belly with lotus stem and salmon in yellow curry. Two desserts were toro cheesecake and coconut chocolate bowl. The later was creative, the chocolate bowl looks like a coconut shell. We like the two appetizers and curry. I did hope they offer their classic meat curry in the event menu. I am not a big fan of well-done salmon. The rainbow salad was colourful with more than ten ingredients and the green rice at the centre was a result of pandan leaves. Best salad for me. The portion is not big. The taste was very good, left you wanting more. The ambiance is classy. The service was good but waited a little bit long for bill and card machine. Will come back. I hope they have a quick service lunch menu."

/user_details?userid=wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,Jess L.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Looking last-minute for a place for a party of nine, my family was a little worried. Plus, Siam was not even on Yelp yet! (It opened January 2018.) But OpenTable included Siam's listing, and we went for it. Siam ended up being one of our favorite meals of the trip.Our waiter - shucks, I didn't catch his name - was very friendly and attentive. He gave us a good lay of the land with the menu. He mentioned the excellent peanut sauce, which I was a little skeptical of because, I mean, who can mess up peanut sauce?Truthfully, everything we got was excellent. And yes, the peanut sauce was better than others we have had!The duck wontons and chicken satay were great starters to share. I was lucky enough to get two duck wontons (5 per order). I got the green curry as my main. The menu shows two pepper signs, which indicate the highest level of spicy. It was definitely spicy but not outrageously so. If you ever like medium spicy, this level of spicy is totally manageable. Flavors were really nice and better than your average  green curry.Everyone else at the table really liked their dishes, too. The other dishes included Pad Thai, Ginger Chicken, Chef Panitith's crispy chicken (which our waiter described as a less breaded General Tso's - true!), Pad Mee, and Kao Cluk Ka Pi rice dish (sort of like a deconstructed and elevated fried rice). I tried a bite of each of these dishes, and they were all very good.The final touch was that our waiter brought out taro cheesecake desserts for our birthday guests of honor with a fun sparkler. While we all agreed we likely wouldn't have ordered the cheesecake ourselves, it was truly divine! I highly recommend ordering it.A little pricey but elegant, unique, and casual. Great meal!"

When I entered into the venue I was please with the ambience and also the decor. They have a patio, inside seating as well upstairs have bar seating and regular seating. The upstairs also has an outside bar. This place is amazing for Vegan's !!!! They have a Vegan Menu on their menu. We opted to share an order of Vegan Spring Roll which came with an amazing peanut sauce and sweet and sour sauce. I ordered a Vegan Pad Thai which was amazing ! My friend ordered the Vegan General Tao Chicken. I found the Vegan Pad Thai an amazing size and non greasy ! My friend loved their dish and found the sauce amazing as well. I also saw many great salads on the menu. The parking in the area is not the greatest. Their is however parking across the street underground. The service was prompt and amazing ! Although I find the music too loud to understand what anyone is saying and to have a conversation. But it is a beautiful venue and very well priced !!"
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A lovely Thai place at the bottom of a hotel. Great food, smallish portions; though we shared quite a few dishes and it wasn't a problem. The peppercorn beef and duck curry in particular were very nice, and not greasy at all (which I've come to expect from low-quality duck dishes). Plenty of rice came with each dish, and when I asked to take away the little bits we had left, the waitress included more rice, which was lovely. I'm pretty sure she said it was unlimited refills on rice, as well!The main issue is how very dark it is inside -- my mum had trouble seeing the menu in the dark, and we weren't the only ones using our phone lights to read! It's a nice ambience, for sure, but at the expense of comfort."
/user_details?userid=iF_nTUa6rS-o7MfFHD1dNg,Alice F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",3 star rating,"Not very authentic but lovely Thai food. This restaurant has a beautiful and elegant decor. We were there early, so I can guess that it probably gets very loud later because of the layout. The cocktail menu is short but creative. The wine list is concise but has good options for pairing with Asian food. The appetizer list is pretty standard: I enjoyed the imperial rolls. The beef larb is actually a Thai influenced beef tartare, which is not what it is in Thailand--unexpected, but the most flavorful dish of the night. I usually order a pad Thai as a baseline to compare restaurants (and because I love pad Thai) and this one was fine. Everything was very mild, so once I asked for extra chili, I was happier. Request the chef's chili sauce if you like an extra kick. The chef's crispy chicken was the main dud of the night-- basically sweet and sour chicken with a little Thai spin. I'd try this place again and order differently."

It had a lot more of a high or classy ambiance type of restaurant. They had a great drink menu, tried two drinks and both were a nice sweet. I had the beef in green curry which was delicious. The curry was the right amount of spicy with tender chunks of beef. Right after the meal, I did end up having a stomach ache that lasted for a couple of hours. Not quite sure if it was the combination of the food I had or something else."

We ordered the shrimp and pineapple rice, pad see ew, beef green curry, and stir fried vegetables. It all came out after 10 minutes, and everything was delicious. The beef and shrimp were tender, the vegetables were crisp and flavorful, and both my parents (notoriously critical diners) raves about the curry. My mom, who was born in Vietnam and loves southeast Asian cuisine, even suggested stopping by after the performance for more.The staff was courteous and very efficient, bringing more water before we could ask and promising us endless rice. Highly, highly recommend. Next time I come to Montreal, I know where to go for delicious Thai food."

My friend couldn't finish her bowl of noddle as they mixed it with some crispy ingredient which apparently doesn't match together. My plate was basically spicy rice with an egg. Our waiter was really great. He saved the evening by giving us a facial sign to ignore the bartender when I asked him if they were closing soon and gave us this attitude like "" yeah dude, we close at 11pm and it's 11:30pm already, duh "". Definitely not returning to this Siam, the one in Quartier Dix30 by far much better in terms of atmosphere, especially during summertime with their big terrace open."
/user_details?userid=M2kvC_-UDyr58h-SGgoicg,Jeff R.,"Langley, Canada",4 star rating,Really good Panang Curry beef dish. The sauce was amazing and beef nice and tender. Needed extra rice to mop up the curry sauce and probably would have exploded if I didn't finally say enough. Delicious.Started with the coconut shrimp skewers and they were very crispy and hot an also very delicious.Nice atmosphere and very attentive and well versed staff to help explain anything on the menu.I think I will try and make it back for another meal before I leave town.
/user_details?userid=HZyIDRzPteWN2PSiRhxmuA,Melody B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Got the pad seew for takeout and the mango saladI was staying at Novotel next door on a Sunday when a lot is closed and just wanted Thai food in instead of salad or burgers.Not cheap but it sure hit the spot. The mango is shredded with strange rice cracker things and the pad seew has a ton of beef-- tender and tasty. The Chinese broccoli sits on top whole so I had to cut it up but all good. This is not a light low cal dish-- kinda greasy and awesome. I was happy and full!
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a 5 star place for thai curry lovers in montreal. I tried this place with a group of colleagues for lunch. I've been looking for a place to get a nice thai curry and i have just found it! This is a semi formal and spacious restaurant. The settings are nice and modern and allow one to focus on the food! We got different curries and a padthai. Service was polite and prompt. But the highlight was indeed the food! Everyone enjoyed their dishes; fresh, carefully prepared ingredients;  and for me tasty tasty tasty sweet and spicy coconut milk based red curry from heaven! Quite impressively, and this was a 1st for me, the quality of the meat in the stews was excellent. I'm used to getting medium quality meet cut to smaller pieces and scattered in thai curries. At Siam my stew came with a generous duck breast cut, placed on top of the stew, yummy crispy skin visible on top, and juicy flavorful meat hiding right under - should have taken a photo :( my colleagues had similar experiences with their food.The curries are on the pricy side, 20-30 before tip and tax. But they do come with a serving of rice. So in consideration of my health and pocket, I'm not going back tomorrow :D but I've already added this place to my list of favs in montreal."
/user_details?userid=zJizx5D3hS4uXWSmHxFeHA,Meghana K.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1 star rating,Fantastic Ambience. The waiter we had was young energetic guys. Seemed to know lot about food and vine. Then we ordered the food with sampler platter for appetizers. I specifically asked the guy that we dont eat beef or pork ...so he said sure I will replace the spring roll to chicken satay. We got the platter and when I had the spring roll I had doubt looking at it  that there was some kind of meat in it. By that time my kids and husband had already had that spring roll. So I asked the waiter what kind of meat was in the roll. He said PORK. We were upset. But we said ok...poor kid he might have made mistake. So kept my mouth shut .He did not even asked or offered to take the platter off the bill after his BiG MISTAKE. ON TOP OF IT he did not show up to bring bill. He sends a female who we didn't see before.  Then he charged extra $13 $ for that item. We paid everything without any issues. Since we were NOT At ALL SATISFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE...we tipped $10. That female waitress had nerve to say you tipped too low ...u should tip 15%. What a nasty person is that waiter and waitress WE DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. FOOD WAS NOT GREAT EITHER.
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"We ended up in Siam because Yelp told us this is a good Thai restaurant and we fully agree. The setting of Siam is beautiful and classy. The food was really delicious and I had an outstanding litchi martini. The mango salad was extremely satisfying, spicy and rich in flavors. Shrimp fried rice would not deceive you, five plumb shrimp, cooked to perfection. The vegan pad thai has an amazing mix of fresh veggies, the noodles were slightly overcooked in soy sauce, but overall the dish was pretty good. Ask for the chef's special hot sauce, it is amazing and it is so hot that if I was a kid of Daenerys, flames and fire would engulf Sainte Catherine street. The service was a little bit confusing, it seems everybody in the restaurant was ready to satisfy our needs, but we had to chase the bill, at the minimum we got enough water to keep the fire down. Prices are a little bit steep, but the overall experience justifies the investment. We would be definitely back."

He had searched for me and found me, and I am incredibly thankful as I have no idea what I would have done without me wallet. I've never had such an amazing waiter... THANK YOU!

The cocktails here are interesting and FANTASTIC but the food is disappointing as some dishes are very tasty while others are bland and some are unacceptable. The appetizer tasting platter was good and included duck wontons which were very good; the mango salad was tasty while the papaya salad was extremely bland; the Seafood Tom Kah Soup was so bad that it left me wondering if the person who prepared it had any knowledge of Thai flavours or had ever tasted this soup as it's supposed to be prepared: It arrived at the table with almost no creaminess to it, the kitchen then sent out an extremely tiny container of something that was supposed to be coconut milk but which was so thin and watery that if it was coconut milk then it would have been diluted to the nth degree and did nothing to improve the dishwater flavour of the soup. The liquid itself was extremely sour yet devoid of any other flavour, just awful, inedible; the Confit Duck in Red Curry was tasty but extremely sweet; the Beef in Green Curry was excellent. I'll return to this restaurant to have more of the wonderful cocktails and appetizers but my experience with that ""soup"" and the bland papaya salad, two very common Thai dishes, makes me wary to try other dishes."

/user_details?userid=UKCxo1B1XaZcuDcafmXfRA,Yvan S.,"Geneva, Switzerland",2 star rating,Several things were wrong:1) attitude upon arriving with the maître d'hôtel/ manager looking down on us (party of 5) as if we could not afford the place. We were in jeans so what? 2) drinks took ages to arrive about 20 mins for 2 Diet Coke and ice teas. Only the Mojito arrived quickly but even that barely had any rhum in it.  3) One starter only after we reminded them of it being missed so about 10 Minutes after the other starters. 4) the main courses took slightly more than an hour to arrive. I eat a lot of Thai food across the world and Thailand so generally know my Thai food quite well - from experience know that what we ordered never take this long to prepare. 5) food was nothing special. 6) I tipped very little to show my dissatisfaction and was told you did not appreciate the service to which I said I did not and there was not even an acknowledgement or an attempt to apologize.  Definitely do not recommend this restaurant.

But our waiter was very friendly and most of the food were delish (definitely try the beef). The spring roll was so-so, should have ordered the Imperial Rolls (deep-fried) and the Tom Yum lacked spiciness (maybe because Canadian doesn't like spicy food?). But will definitely come back when we're craving Thai food."
/user_details?userid=Hex5KcfgYveCuPQeF99M3w,Amy F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Perhaps all the high ratings come from tourists who don't know that there are so many good restaurants in Montreal.  The atmosphere is ok. It is close to the Bell centre.  That's it. The chicken curry was like a soup in which a few tiny parts of chicken and tiny bits of eggplant and beans were floating... Overpriced and way below par.  Go elsewhere!

We had the spring rolls and papaya salad and the panang beef and garlic tofu. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like tofu said it was the best he ever had and loved it. The beef was braised and so delicious. We finished with the creme brulee which had such a great kaffir lime leaf flavor. We were there during happy hour so drinks and appetizers were cheaper. 5 dollar glasses of wine and 6 dollar draft beers. Keep in mind the appetizers are smaller. Our server was amazing. He was funny, charming and knowledgeable. Also a great place if you have food allergies. I have a gluten intolerance and he came back with a whole chart on what I can and can't eat from the menu. They have it for peanuts, dairy and shellfish as well. This put me at ease and helped me have an amazing dining expirience.  I fully recommend and we will be back next time we are in town!"
