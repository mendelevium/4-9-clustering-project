Since it's BYOW it's perfect for any occasion. I've been here for an intimate dinner, I've been here with a small group of friends and I've also been here with a rowdy crowd and everytime the service was great! The food is always delicious. Meat just fall off the bones. They even have gluten free couscous which makes me very happy :D Order the mint tea once you are done eating and watch them pour that mofo like pros. I have been back many times and will still go back for more. Make sure you wear stretchy pants as they top up the couscous and the delicious broth with vegetables when you run out"
/user_details?userid=nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,Henry L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing! I went here during the height of a festival on nearby St. Laurent and was surprised to find the entire restaurant empty. The tables were meticulously clean and very organized. Featuring Berber cuisine (the Berbers are a minority ethnic group found mainly in Morocco and Algeria), I left with a nearly obsessive need to visit those countries. Au Coin Berbere's vegetable couscous was served hot and each complimented the other to make for a fantastic culinary experience. Not only that, our server and the owner was terrific; he offered recommendations, was attentive, and promptly brought the food out. The interior featured fascinating photos of Morocco and although the prices were cheap, made for an atmosphere of very fine dining. The Turkish Coffee, or Moroccan Mint tea are a must and I recommend drinking them alongside their delicious desserts. For those who drink, bring your own wine."

Au Coin Berbère is no doubt the best place in town for this staple of North-African cuisine. Before discussing the main course, let's talk first impressions. Upon arriving, I noticed the restaurant was pretty small and that it was packed. The ambiance was really festive and the decoration was simple but elegant. Nothing to complain about here. Then we were served entrees. I ordered a Berber salad. My salad was very light. The ingredients were fresh and the vinaigrette complemented the vegetables just right. I knew immediately I was in for a good meal. Now let's get back to the important matter at hand : the couscous. Bloody hell it was delicious! The couscous grains were very thin. Believe me, it's what makes or breaks a couscous. Then the sauce itself was tasty. Perfectly seasoned like a good traditional couscous should be and the vegetables were tender and sweet. Adding some harissa made the whole mix taste even better. Then there was the meat. I ordered the merguez couscous and the meat was cooked to perfection. It was seasoned properly and it was so tender that it melted in the mouth. Overall, the couscous was a success. Now for desserts, I ordered a baklava. Again, nothing to complain about. Not too sugary, not too sweet (which is usually my pet peeve in desserts), crunchy enough... all in all a good dessert! I finished my night with a good mint tea and it was the best choice to wash the food down with. When I left, I felt as if I gained 10 pounds from my stomach hurting. The portions were incredibly generous so if you're wondering why the menu is a bit pricey, THIS IS WHY. Don't worry about not getting your money's worth because you definitely will! I believe that Au Coin Berbère is a perfect blend of quality and quantity. If you want to taste an amazing traditional couscous and feel completely stuffed by the end of the day, this is the place to go."

We shared the couscous and the lamb. The lamb was very tasty and tender but the couscous...dry. We were quite disappointed.Honestly, I made better couscous at home.This place can be perfect for people that doesn't know much about traditional Berber dishes."

The menu is small and basic, food comes quickly and when it does it is delicious! It is rather pricey,  coming out to about 19 dollars a person. They do take reservations and debit/credit cards.Good food, good service and bring your own wine! I will definitley return!"
/user_details?userid=XMAXpZsBQEuk0f2xlyZ6vw,Blake G.,"Las Cruces, NM",3 star rating,"After walking all over Montreal, I decided to try this place. I'm a vegetarian and, even though the restaurant had only one vegetarian main course, I seldom get the chance to eat Algerian so decided to eat here anyway.I started with the berber salad -- apple, sweet pepper, cucumber, tomato, and mint, supposedly, though I don't remember any apple and, if there was mint, there wasn't much of it. It was okay, but uninteresting. The waiter also brought me pita with harissa sauce. The pita was thin and seemed stale. I ordered the vegetable couscous for my main course. The stewed vegetables were served separately from the couscous. Both look like something you might get in a friend's grandmother's house. There was enough food for two people, but I ate it all. The waiter asked if I wanted more.The stew seemed to lack any spices whatsoever, but perhaps that's normal in berber cuisine, which I know is supposed to be relatively plain. I loaded it with harissa sauce, which made it a little more tasty. The waiter seemed aloof and wasn't very helpful. Overall, my experience was disappointing. Perhaps a meat-eater would like it better."
/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My girlfriend described this place best: it feels like someone's lounge. The owner is also host, waiter, cashier and, I think, helps out in the kitchen. When a family hedges its bets on a business so intensely, you know they'll do their best.Well, it was fantastic. The vegetable couscous base was very balanced taste-wise and the stewing juices were very helpful in making my own lamb shank - couscous - vegetable mix a masterpiece.I would have devoured the lamb shank alone and left everything else. It was perfect, giving in to the slightest fork pressure and melting in my mouth.Dessert-wise, go for the stuffed dates. First and foremost because dates are a typical regional fruit and because this dessert will have you begging for more (don't be tempted, or your blood sugar won't thank you). Mint tea was brewed excellently, with fresh and tasty mint and served in pretty glassware.Service is family-style: polite, involved and lively. The owner joked with a large group of Francophones sitting at another table and being a little bit loud. It is a place I will be back to, for its delicious treats and the quaint, relaxed atmosphere I love so much. That feeling of the extra dedication, the extra passion for the food you're eating and, not to be forgotten, the really great prices."
/user_details?userid=rocomf5PiSU2Po_50dlurQ,Genre S.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"My kind of shack. Carpet stains to scare away the obnoxious 'foodmeisters' or whatever the new tag for douche is, but hey! is that cris' white cloth nappies, on matching tablecloth? Something tells me the owner knows the difference between the function of a floor and the function of a table. I hit places in Calgary you could eat off of the floors and walls, but you'd have to bring your own from home 'cause the food is so damn dull, it's overpricing makes it taste bad! The place was dead, Guy sits us -- turns out he owns the place. We order various animal bits with plants, all set to flame in a few different ways. Waited. Scratch cooking, and then BLAM! the locals show up. Place gets packed, mostly by one boisterous group and university students making out with drinks and snacks. Guy was on the ball with everyone -- he got our foodbits to us after he got all the new orders set up. Good pacing through and through. Apps came quick, gave time to snack and talk. When the mains came, all was freshhot, couscous was lighter than Bic, veggies had perfect texture (IE leafies had bouncebackability, roots could be bit-chewed but still had surface resilience). The lamb was trying to jump off the bone, and succeeded at throwing itself into my face. Portions? Get out of town. I couldn't sleep at first I ate so much lamb with plant-bit stew. Gahhh, a top recommendation if you're spinning around little portugal. Do it do it do it do it...."
