The owner Peter is usually on site cooking himself in the kitchen and is very well organized. The food is delicious and they are currently open during the Covid-19 pandemic offering take-out/pick-up. They're located in the trendy Mile-End neighborhood which is full of other amazing restaurants, café's and stores. QDC burger was born out of its original restaurant downtown called Queue De Cheval which is known for their steaks and high end food. One of the best burger places in town a must go-to!"
/user_details?userid=Ei127XW-Am6KWSYx3poVnw,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"QDC Burger is the kind of place you want to try at least once in your life. The meat is high quality, juicy, tasty and fresh. The produce they use to make the burgers are all fresh. As for the French fries, they're probably the best I've tried but I have to admit they don't put a lot."
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is literally my favourite burger in all of Montreal! Burger meat is of very high quality (from queue de cheval steakhouse), gourmet toppings, bun is fresh, fries are exactly how you'd want them : crisp outside but soft inside. Another nice touch: all their sauces are homemade! Bourbon ketchup, curry mayo, aioli mayo.... enough said. The small joint on st Viateur is bar-style, no frills  (can only fit about 6). I don't mind this though, you really come here for the food. Ps. Come hungry portions are huge."
/user_details?userid=fg84diFNYRKQCH_dkj_eBg,Rabih C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,What a burger they have. Every burger is amazing. I mean each and every one. Try the poutine with some ribs meat. Sounds like just another poutine....but no. It is real good.
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Newly opened on st viateur, I believe this is a subsidiary of queue de cheval downtown. They also have a QDC on de la montagne (next to queue de cheval). The place looks great albeit it is a bit small. On a busy day you'd be better off getting to go. Adam and I visited on a Saturday for lunch. There was no one. Seating is comfortable and you have the choice of sitting right in front of the grill or more towards the back. The menu is in paper tick off menu so you check off what you want and hand it to the cashier. A side note is that Adam is very tall so he didn't fit well on the bar stools and so he wasn't comfortable. Since it is an open kitchen layout be aware that they will talk loudly. A creative menu! They have burgers, poutine, and lobster!! That they make fresh. I love lobster rolls so might come back and try it. They also had a short ribs poutine that looked delicious. I got a customized burger - comes with tomatoes, caramelized onions, and lettuce. You add your own condiments from the condiment station in the back.I made it more simple and more me - lettuce, bacon, cheddar cheese, and added my own mayo. I also got the smaller patty (1/3 of a pound). The only bummer is they still use a full size bun even with a smaller patty. So I tasted everything else more than the patty, which was a standout. They should have smaller bread for the 1/3 of a pound patty. Adam got the lefty's burger - caramelized onions, bacon, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and aioli. He loved it. He was completely full by the end of his meal. We also got a chocolate milkshake. It was good and had bits of Oreo in it. Also a good consistency to drink with a thin straw. The burgers don't come with fries but the cook was nice enough to let us try some. They were great! Fluffy and salty and lightly crunchy. Things are big more expensive than usual for this part of town but if you're in the mood for a burger. This is one of the only places on st viateur. A promising start! Excited to try more of their menu."

/user_details?userid=B7f5iHcyszjiHthLr5_6zA,TC N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I first chanced upon QDC Burger in the restricted area at Montreal Pierre Trudeau Airport, of all places. I wasn't even in the mood for food. I was with colleagues and all they wanted to talk about before the flight was work. It was late evening. Somebody suggested talking over food. So we sat at a convenient burger cafe, and I ordered the Lefty Burger. We also shared a poutine. Boy-oh-boy... what a burger! Despite the time, place, company and conversation, I was awakened. My senses came alive, and I wolfed it down. (I shall not attempt to describe the Lefty as I cannot do it justice, so you'll need to find out for yourself.) The poutine too was outstanding. I ended up eating most of it, at my colleagues' expense. At that time I didn't even notice the name of the burger cafe. It was only on my next trip out that I took note, written in a relatively small font, QDC Burger. Finally, after months of finding the right time and opportunity, I visited the original burger joint on St Viateur with my family. It's small; there are only ten seats here, six of which are at the counter where you can watch the fun and chat with the chefs. It's totally different from the cafe at the airport, but the Lefty is still the Lefty. We also tried a few other burgers - the Classic, the Mob, the Steakhouse, and the Rico Opera. The two chefs took our orders, chatted with us as they flipped the patties (of high-quality beef, I should mention), slapped on ingredients and in-house sauces, and presented the completed burgers in Instagram-able style on a wood platter. All I can say is - there's a lot that goes into the recipe and putting together of each of the burgers, resulting in a delectable culinary experience! We didn't have space for the poutine this time, unfortunately. We promised ourselves we'll be back for them. And for the lobster burger, the General Tao, the Jefferson, and of course the Steak Frite. By the way, we've just had the burgers at the world-renown Shake Shack in NYC. Those are legendary. But I would not be exaggerating if I say that the burgers at QDC Burger pose a serious challenge to them any day. Our experience at QDC Burger was no doubt far more pleasant and saner."

The chef, ""Queen Victoria"", hahaha, yes that's what the local guys were calling her! She's got the gift of gab but she can handle the pressure and pump out the food too without breaking a sweat over the hot grill!! But seriously folks, try this place out, limited seating but worth the wait! Try the lobster Mac and cheese on a burger, wholly Sh*****t!!! Lucky for me there was a doctor on site at the time!!"

/user_details?userid=WTJoQj2Dl1RmF0uTAyTKNg,Pam D.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"If you are looking for one of the best burgers of your life (if not THE best burger), check out QDC Burger.  The starting ingredients must be outstanding because the taste is fantastic!  Every burger we saw come off the grill was a masterpiece - the Jefferson, the lefty something, the meatball thing. Wow.  Fries are also great. Well done Chef Victoria, you make a heck of a burger and we burger-lovers thank you."
