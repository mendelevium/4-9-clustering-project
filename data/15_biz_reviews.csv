I sent them a nice note on my delivery order during Covid 19 (yes, they're open!) and they sent me back a lovely bag covered in notes, with extra goodies inside! Their mango sticky rice was an absolute stand out, and the vegetarian Pad Thai and pineapple rice were excellent as well. Excellent food, excellent customer service. Can't wait to try their cocktail menu once this whole thing is over with!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pamika was my last restaurant meal before covid-19 measures took place. I really enjoyed their food but unfortunately their service was off that night.Cocktails were excellent, definitely worth ordering! Anyone that loves spicy food is going to love Pamika. Their papaya salad was super spicy and delicious. We ordered the chicken brochettes were really good, they were on he sweet side and balanced out the rest of our spicy meal well. Our favorite dish was the chicken curry, it was spicy, creamy and umami. I would order it again and again! Pad Thai was also good but nothing special.Service wasn't great that evening. The staff was friendly but they weren't attentive. They brought us the green curry to share but without any bowls and it took us at least 10 min to get someone's attention. We also needed a spoon and another napkin at some point and couldn't flag anyone down. They were really busy that evening, probably an off night"

We shared : Tom ka soup : flavourful coconut / ginger / lemongrass / chicken /soup. Perfect for hot weather 5/5Shrimp pad Thai: always delicious here. Flavours are balanced and noodles are al dente 5/5Beef Penang red curry: thick creamy sauce with thin beef slices. 5/5 Lived in Thailand for 18 years and this took me back home. Would recommend for sure.

The Beef Panaeng was tasty, wish there was a bit more vegetables. The Chicken Green curry was unique, loved the winter melon! This was my favorite. Would have liked extra vegetables. The rice & consistency was good! Will order again and explore the menu. It is promising!"
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Easily the BEST Thai I've had in Montreal - but so expensive?!?I paid about $25 for a rendang beef that was so good that I would take a bath in the sauce, but even for the best rendang beef I've had in my life, TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS is an insanely high cost to pay. It wasn't even that much beef - I'd say a normal amount, it wasn't stingy, but for $25... idk, I would expect a whole damn steak for that, and it definitely wasn't  And it didn't even come with rice!But let's talk about the rest of it. I was introduced to riceberry rice, since it came free with my order, and it was FAN. TASTIC. A little crunchy, a little chewy, extremely savoury and sweet at the same time - I can't wait to try it again. I would even be tempted to order extra to use in a salad the next day. A friend of mine basically DEMANDED that I try the mango and coconut sticky rice dessert, and he was right. You NEED to try this. The softness of the fresh mango mixed with the sticky rice texture, and topped with a light, sweet coconut sauce - if your mouth isn't already watering, you may be dead. Or allergic to one of the ingredients. Or maybe not a dessert person. I won't judge. Honestly, I love love LOVE this place, I just think that it's one of the most egregiously expensive restaurants in Montreal, so I'm saving it for special occasions. But I'm excited to get to try it again when I can!"
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried Pamika Thai before trying Mae Sri (another one of the Chef's restaurants) and it was why I was so excited for Mae Sri. This place is great! The decor is gorgeous, especially in the summer when you're seated on the terrace and enveloped by the wood structures and beautiful trees. On top of the amazing ambiance, their food is delicious. This was my first time trying green curry and my oh my oh my! It was out of this world. The flavour is completely different from anything I've ever tasted. But it is so incredibly delicious. The mixture of coconut milk and curry paste is comforting but exciting at the same time (not even sure if that makes any sense??). I've been so intrigued with this dish that I've gotten it three times in the last month (that gives you an idea of how good it is!!). All in all, the portion sizes are great, the service was fast, the servers are really sweet, and the food is incredible. The drinks are a bit funky, but I think it's because I'm not used to these types of flavours. Out of all the drinks, I recommend the one with the pineapple (I forget the name). Needless to say, go here!"
/user_details?userid=6btMczuTVuoJnmarbkWP_A,Lo C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I am overall so very impressed by Pamika. This was a great referral by friends who have stopped by in Montreal.AMBIANCE: 4/5I love how the restaurant is decorated and the vibes it gives off. The interior is dim but has authentic (looking) designs around the restaurant. I was comfortable in seating, with the tables being clean and other parties further apart (no overcrowding here!)FOOD: 5/5We ordered:1. Chicken Satay: The chicken was great quality, gently charred, and the dipping sauces were A+. 2. Pad Thai: I LOVED this. The pad thai was delicious. It was tasty without being saucy. There was a generous amount of chicken. Tip: SQUEEZE THE LEMON.3. Pineapple Fried Rice: Lots of pineapple and chicken in the dish. They serve it to you in pineapple that's split in half. SERVICE: 5/5The servers here are so friendly! Speaking both French & English it was easy to communicate. Our server was also the bartender and right away he told us if we needed anything we just need to wave to him at the bar - which we didn't because he diligently checked up on us.What was outstanding though was the manner the manager handled a disgruntled party. There was a table quite close to us (and quite loud) that had problems starting from when they were being seated down. The original waiter had so much difficulty with them that the manager took over. She was patient and calm, while working towards a resolution (including seating problems, misunderstanding the menu)OVERALL; 5/5This will be a main stop for me when I head back up to Montreal again. MAKE RESERVATIONS."

/user_details?userid=97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ,Rebecca C.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"4.5 stars. Great Thai place reminding me of some of best thai food in Paris. In contrast of the American version, it's not as greasy or sweet and I would come here all of the time if I lived in Montreal. I ordered the Bangkok egg rolls (Crispy and light, the skin is thin, and the sauce is not doused with sugar - fantastic!) and chicken Pai Thai.  I preferred my bean sprouts cooked and had to ask for it twice to get it right. Both are excellent. If you can, grab a table outside on the patio. I ordered the Jasmin tea (tea bag in a pot) - I would skip if I were you."

/user_details?userid=6PBCFf-JFwYFoQ-YE-ow6w,Martin A.,"Berkeley, CA",1 star rating,"Ordered Penang curry - came in a bowl, as if it was a soup. Lots of watery coconut milk, hardly any veggies and some beef. Curry tasted good, beef was tough, however I was really disappointed by the lack of veggies. There were 4-5 tiny (size of a hazelnut) Thai eggplants and 4 thin slivers of red peppers. Question to the owners, ""Since you charge $25 per portion, why are you so cheap and don't add at least 1 pepper to the dish?"" I could not eat all of the coconut milk liquid because it is too heavy but I was also hungry. So basically had no choice but to eat all if the rice with coconut milk. Curry should be thick consistency, this was a soup. Sadly Montreal does not have decent Thai places. Waste of money for $25. Tomorrow I am gonna put some veggies in the remaining liquid and cook it again."

I made a reservation ahead of time (it is a tiny restaurant). The inside is very cool, it reminds me of a cave. The service was excellent and everything came out on time. The food here is filled with flavor and does not disappoint along with fair portion sizes. The drinks were good. My friend got the spicy mojito and it was definitely interesting. All of the other drink we ordered were great. Every time I am in Montreal I have to go here now. Also the mango sticky rice is a MUST!"

We had the thum thai platter which was one of my favourite plates of the night. They also have the traditional thai tea which has milk in it, goes super well with spicy food. The ambiance is super nice, you definitely feel like you're in a thai restaurant. We came around 8:30pm and it was still full of customers.Definitely give it a try, you will not be disappointed:)"

/user_details?userid=JKS0qK9aRNTK4dlunuxV1w,Bobbi S.,"Long Beach, NY",4 star rating,"We three sisters liked the ambiance here, LOVED the proximity to our hotel, Hotel de Paris, (it becomes the hotel's breakfast room each morning), and found the food appealingly presented, and good, albeit not great, tasting. Decor is really nice, prices are on the high-moderate side, drinks are quite expensive, but are thoughtfully presented. We really liked how a Thai chili tops a few of the bar offerings, which is where we chose to eat since there were no available tables. You can get your meals unspiced, somewhat spiced, and fiery hot. Staff is mellow, engaging, and made us feel quite welcome. So, add a star for that gift."

/user_details?userid=JXfUPmN87P2TEpM3utgdqg,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"A trendy Thai spot, it's slightly difficult to find as it's not labeled very well outside. We had 8 people and ordered the tasting menu. The Bangkok delight is an excellent pineapple and mango purée with Havana anejo that comes with refills for 9$ (which is an okay but not great deal). Throughout the meal, we had everything from gyoza and crispy shrimp to roasted duck salad (extremely spicy!) for appetizers. The duck salad was the better of the bunch here with Napa cabbage for wrapping pieces of the duck. We also had seafood Tom yum soup, beef panaeng curry, green curry, manpu fried rice, crispy pork belly. The green curry was the highlight here containing chicken, winter melon, Thai eggplant. Overall the food was good, would rate 4/5 based on that however for a group reservation, we were placed in a pretty cramped space by the door that was rather cold and the service was fairly inadequate in terms of the waitress often not checking in for half an hour at a time and combined with the tight space of our table, the table was always cluttered with finished plates and messiness the entire time. Because these reasons, would have to bring the grade down a tick because of service."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm not sure what is all the hype about Pamika. The food is good, but really nothing exceptional. Price wise the the restaurant is very competitive, not to say relatively cheap. We had a family style dinner and got to try wide variety of dishes. From authenticity point of view I did not find the food spicy enough, besides the fact that I prefer thicker curries. What really ruined my experience was the table we were seated at. We were group of six, with an original reservation for seven. For whatever reason we were assigned a table that is not in the common area, but a separated area just next to the entrance, which seemed to be underneath some stairs. The table was not comfortable at all, there was no support for the back at the seats, the heating was insufficient and the cold air from the restaurant door will infiltrate each time a customer will come or leave. There were some curtains that were supposed to protect us, but as soon as the food started coming the curtains were practically opened and nothing could save us from freezing. Further to that to sit at the table you have to literally fold yourself. As a result I returned home with a severe pain in my back. Kudos to the personnel who did everything possible to serve us, including bending down in the little area to take our orders and bring food timely. On the other hand this table should not be offered to customers between November and April, when a sufficient heating can not be secured. Our friend who did the reservation should have been warned and asked if that table option is fine. At this stage I personally would not return to Pamika as I don't appreciate food institution that does not care about the health of its patrons."

They have a cute little terrace fullof light bulbs where you can enjoy a nice meal. The food is great! Their soups are amazing ( see some photos in my review). Inside its very stylish and authentic. The only down for us was that there was no more beer of almost aby kind.... so that was a bugger. If not.... amazing !!

Price is a bit expensive for the quantity of food but the flavors felt very homey. A good date night place but there is probably better Thai food at a better price point.The pad Thai could have used a special kick, pretty much standard pad Thai. The stir fry mushrooms were flavorful but it was a small entree compared to usual."
/user_details?userid=HPtNvEBZTZzD6XhNMSdWEA,Andrea A.,"Burlington, VT",2 star rating,"Cocktails were GREAT, but service was subpar and so was the food. The sauce on the crispy pork belly was pretty much just oyster sauce, and despite the multiple pepper icons on the menu, neither that nor the krapow were very spicy at all. The rice was also pretty dry.We got an odd vibe from our server, like he didn't want us to hang around (quite contrary to the usual Montreal vibe of dining out for ages!). He seemed very surprised when we slurped down our first drinks and wanted a second round, and then we weren't able to find him when we wanted the bill so we could head back to our hotel. And for most of our meal, he flitted around the tables around us, chatting with regulars. Maybe we were snubbed because we were obvious tourists / not speaking French?"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stop searching for a Thai restaurant in Montreal - I've discovered the best one in town!Came to Pamika for dinner last week and literally didn't want to leave or stop eating! The restaurant was packed on a Tuesday night but we had reservations and were quickly seated surrounded by awesome Thai decor and a cozy ambiance. We were told that the special of the day was a mixed dish of papaya salad, sticky rice, and pork chops so we decided to start with that, and then order two more dishes to share (it's basically a tapas style restaurant) which we were told would be enough food. We opted for the beef curry and the crispy shrimp. The special of the day came out first and was so delicious I could cry. The papaya salad was spicy but so flavorful while the pork chops were sweet and tender. The sticky rice was great to cut a bit of the spice from the salad. Next, our curry came and I literally never wanted it to end. Perfectly marinated and flavored, this is hands down the best Thai beef curry I've ever had! Sadly, the portion wasn't that generous and it was quickly finished leaving a ton of sauce that I wanted to bathe in to avoid wasting but alas... sometimes things don't always work out your way. Finally the shrimp came out - to be honest, I was really underwhelmed by this dish but hubby loved it so maybe it's just me but I wouldn't order it again.Solid service, amazing food, a bit pricey, but will 1000000% be back. 4.5 stars but since we can't give half stars, an easy 5 star rating goes to Pamika. Can't wait to be back!"

Basically, everything we had was really amazing from the papaya salad, to the shrimp tempura covered with fried noodles and their shrimp pad Thai. It was an amazing taste of Thailand minus the flight there. Staff was extremely friendly but service was a bit slow. I would definitely go back. Yum yum yum! Writing this makes me want to go back :-)"

The place is petite but adorable. Our dinner party was 8:30pm; but food was served at 9:40ish... by then the hunger was making few people cranky. Since we were a huge group, the food was served as buffet. The appetizers were the best!!! From shrimp rolls, vegetables spring rolls and seafood salad. The rest of the food were average.The shocking part was the price; 40$ for the small amount food. What was unbelievable is that if you go on their website the group menu goes up to 35$. We never investigated, since it was a bday party and it was very late, and there is a massive snow storm."

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Make sure you reserve before coming to not wait 45 min like us. The pineapple drink came inside an actual pineapple. If you want a refill of this drink, it's 25% cheaper. It's better to share one drink and then get a refill. As for the food, we took the shrimps wrapped in noodles as an appetizer. It was crunchy and delicious. For the main, we tried the red curry with seafood and some spicy pork. Both were ok but if you're used to eating spicy stuff, it's not really spicy. The waiter warned us about how spicy the food is and to be careful but I was a bit disappointed. Look for the pepper signs. For us spicy food lover:1 pepper: nothing at all. Just sweet. 2 peppers: ok i feel some tingle...3 peppers and more: yeah ok now we're talkingThe service is awesome. The bartender was very friendly and nice and gave us a free shot for waiting. The deco is dark but perfect for hanging out.Overall, it's very pricey for asian food (you can pretty much get the same dish for cheaper with a bigger portion elsewhere and with a more authentic taste) and it was overly sweet. Although the service was awesome, I don't go to a restaurant for the service but for the food."

The food was extremely good and service was great. However the next time we went here a day after Valentines and ordered the exact same things, we were given food which was completely different. Maybe they have changed chefs! It wasn't appealing to look at as the Curry and Penang were watery and tasteless. We had asked for it to be spicy, but the Curry barely had ANY taste at all. The food came out after much delay, and even then it was only the Beef Penang and it took them another 15 mins for the Curry. Service was slow, and food was below average. Consistency is key in this business. And to maintain the standards, of food and service both. Disappointed with our experience as we really love Thai and had a great time the first time around."

/user_details?userid=B98CoLIwXcYm0Sb2NCdJ-A,Yolo M.,"Northville, MI",1 star rating,"Yeah - way over-rated if you consider yourself even just a fan (versus connoisseur) of Thai food.  First off, we were informed we could not get a table at all that night (it was 6 pm) as tables were reserved for those seeking the ""Thai BBQ Experience"".   I had no bloody idea what that meant, but when I saw the price for 3 at $69 and that would get us an outdoor patio seat on a scenic street in Montreal - I said ""Thai Experience"" it is! The truth of the matter is I don't think this made any sense at all.  We would have enjoyed a great a la carte meal and had a few drinks and spent well in excess of the $69.  So we get seated outside and I sure am glad to enjoy a nice Thai dinner.Then things start going downhill.  The Thai BBQ experience is basically a DIY experience.  A hot plate, along with lots of meats, veggies and noodles are brought to your table.  Listen, I could have stayed at home to cook my own dinner.  Remember I was dining out DIFM - do it for me.  We did not have an auspicious start as the gas plate almost blew my head off when it was lit. This experience lasted about 5 minutes before I got pissed as I got smacked with water and sauce all over my shorts.  It was bad enough that the ants were already crawling all over my ass outdoors.  I was done!  I just said we are done, we will pay for our mistake (and the stupid restaurant forcing us in this direction) and order a la carte.  Ultimately we did order Pad Thai, Beef Panang, Papaya Salad and Spring Rolls.  The latter two were worthy.  The Pad Thai and Panang Beef were weak:Our waitress Chandanah was great.  She was willing to help including doing all the cooking for us.  However, I was done with the DIY concept and there was no way to recover from that.  Chandanah saved us from a completely disastrous evening.Ultimately several recommendations for the restaurant:- make the Thai BBQ an option only not a requisite as it was for us- improve the quality of the core menu - pad Thai, Panang Beef- do something to get rid of the ant infestation on the deckThe management did take 50% of the price of the original BBQ off the bill.  That was nice but I assure you there was not $35 worth of provisions there.  Again - it's not the money that matters - it is the experience."

We showed up an hour earlier sinxe it was nice out and they seemed to have a nice cocktail list, we thpught we'd just relax at the bar or whatever.We were seated outside on the terrace and ended up staying there the whole night when we found out that the BBQ is only available for tables on the terrace ( Also the guests who reserved the table outside actually liked the inside so everything worked out perfectly for everyone)The place is very cute. The terrace a little cramped when all the tables are filled but we managed. The inside is very cute as well, would be nice for a date. The staff is very nice, polite and helpful. We could tell it was very hot as they were sweaty but they never lost their smiles and enthusiasm.We had a few cocktails to start with and they were all very good. Then we had dumplings & 3 salads: crispy spicy duck, mango and green papaya and all were delicious. My fav is the duck. The we had the small BBQ which was more than enough for 4 of us and had 3 desserts: pandan tapioca, pandan creme caramel & mango & sticky rice, all yummy.I would come back here to try the other dishes in the menu :)"

We ordered take-out after not being able to make a reservation last winter, and we wanted to make sure we get the dine-in experience this time. Food quality is exceptional here! We ordered the crispy shrimp, panang curry, massaman curry, pineapple fried rice, and mango sticky rice. All tasty, savory, and rich in texture. Service was very slow since it was a day before Labor Day. Our waiter told us that they were short staffed because they did not foresee such a busy night. All together, we were there for a bit over 2 hours. Heads up: We were told that the dishes are all meant to be shared between the table and it comes in no particular order, so we got each dish one by one. This might be important to keep in mind if you're looking for a place that will bring out all the dishes at once or if you want a plate to yourself."
/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This little Thai restaurant is hidden away on the north side of Sherbrooke street only a couple of blocks from the Sherbrooke Métro station. It turned out to be a delicious find..Four of my friends joined me for a dinner outing. Reservations was recommended. Despite their Yelp page showing no available tables all evening they did have one large table available for us when I phoned them so if you are a large group call first. Lots of tempting authentic Thai dishes were on the menu. My eyes went right to a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, the crusty shrimp starter, and the spicy green curry shrimp. Some others shared their choices such as a mixed platter of the entrees, a papaya salad, red curry chicken, fried rice and a braised pork dish. No one had complaints. Several people tasted my curry chicken and thought it was delicious. My friends had cocktails btw which were tall or in unusual glasses and had a Thai twist to them. Everyone who has them loved them (most were Mojito variants) except that one guy  who said his wasn't to his taste. Well overall the crispy shrimps were good. They came on a traditional platter, five of them tied up with a mild sweet sauce on the side. The crispy coating was egg noodles which overall I found good but a bit too thick. The jumbo shrimp underneath made up for it though so I'd still recommend it. My main course was the green curry chicken with rice and it was outstanding.it came in a large bowl with a large portion of chicken and Thai eggplants. It wasn't too spicy either although I'm sure you could adjust this. My friend who had the supposed milder red curry said his tasted spicier. So either way it wasn't overwhelmingly hot but.. it tasted delicious especially mixed with the rice. We were all pretty full after our meals and no one took desert or coffee. They didn't offer any traditional Thai after dinner drink which was a bit disappointing. Everyone seemed satisfied, even that one person who is often critical of every restaurant we go to. I sensed he liked it but didn't absolutely love it which for him is a thumbs up. Nutrition wise, I estimated my meal including wine at around 850 calories based on what I ate. I used very little of the shrimps dipping sauce (likely sugar laden). Shrimp of course is high in cholesterol so beware. The chicken was plentiful but in small bites, probably 4-5 ounces which is ideal. I didn't eat all of it or the broth despite it's delicious taste. The rice was white so not natural or the most nutritious but yet traditionally Thai. The coconut milk green curry broth probably had the most damaging elements which were hard to determine. Cocktails were sugary of course and likely laden with calories. Wine is a better alternative and probably has the higher alcoholic content. So if you are watching over your intake eat ideal portion sizes and just don't over eat. Nutritionally I'd pick this over a heavy red meat and potato dinner coupled with a heavy sugary desert any day. Beware though, add in a heavy cocktail or two plus a desert and that calorie estimate could easily double quickly. Your choices matter if diet is a concern. The restaurant ambiance was low lighting with Asian inspired wall murals and lighting fixtures. The light over our large 6 person table was so large it was awkward to talk to the waiter. There were some private booths available also plus seating outdoors on a terrasse.  Overall though a nice cozy Asian inspired atmosphere. It was also packed with patrons, some at large tables celebrating birthdays so apparently quite popular. Service was excellent. The bilingual staff were prompt and polite and no one messed up any of the orders or the somewhat confusing billing (some meals shared, others stand alone). Mine came to $47 including tax ($11 wine, $10 shrimp, $18 chicken curry). Cocktails were in the $10-15 range. I think. So overall easy to get to by metro, no trouble seating a large group, great service, excellent cocktails, good starters and an excellent round of main courses all set in a nice cozy atmosphere.  Pricing generally matched the quality and quantity of the meals. Portion size is up to you and nutritionally it struck me as generally healthier and with more complex tastes and natural ingredients than you'd get in a steak or BBQ chicken type restaurant.  Negatives would be that it's possibly a difficult place to find parking if they don't have a parking lot set aside for their customers (check first), a slightly awkward large round table for larger groups with a slight obstruction hanging from the ceiling. The table size also makes conversation difficult right across the table but this really only is if you are 5 or 6 people. Other tables were put together to seat other large groups so if you call early I'm sure it can be arranged more to your liking. Lastly their YELP page wouldn't accept our reservation but they did when I called so always call. I'd say go try it and enjoy, for sure I'll go back!"
/user_details?userid=nGvLkjB8QxFuhDMP1-IIDA,Dash H.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,"Ok so this Restaurant had a lot of great reviews so i was really excited to try it out. Parking was horrible, we took forever to find a parking spot without the towing sign around. My gf and my bf was with me, we were told there was no tables available. And i can see why. There was limited tables and there were some outside. But it was like 45-50degrees outside we wasn't looking forward to being seated outside. But lucky for us they finally had a table inside open. We sat down and saw a lot of their food platings and it was BEAUTIFUL. The smell was also delicious . So we 3 ordered bout 6 plates of food. We started with the green papaya salad, the papaya was shaved lazily. And i mean it was like thick and big, was not thin and small and lanky like its supposed to be, idk what they were thinking. And the taste of it... was alright. Lots of fish sauce was used so it was salty. It didn't live up to the hype that i was getting from reading all the reviews and looking at all the pictures. Next came the seafood ramen tomyum soup... or something like that. It was EH , i cannot comment enough on how typical the ramen was. It was like something you can buy from the store packaged, and they added like fish sauce and a hint of curry seasoning. Sprinkled with green and white onions. After that, the chicken sate teriyaki or Yakitori came out and it was alright , nothing unique or special. Chicken larb salad, was up next, the spice in it was bitter like ghost pepper, but there was not a good flavor there and it had a bad after taste. Moving on, yum neau was next (beef salad) i have to say this was probably the best dish on their menu. The steak was cooked properly, the salad was sour. I wish i would of wrote the review right after so my mind is more fresh. But i waited a day to think of what to write, so i cant remember what else we ate but it was definitely nothing special or unique to remember. It didnt give me the WOW factor or made me wana go out of my way to come back.I am just being honest, this place is a normal thai place, its not delicious but its not awful, its average. Ive had better. 3 out of 5.Beware of the tomyum, it was def too sour."

Her signature salad, an understandable best seller, has an amazing melding if Thai flavors with fresh ingredients. The pad Thai, good for evaluating Thai restaurants, was delicious. We also thoroughly enjoyed the pineapple fried rice, served in a real pineapple, and green curry. The Pamika salad was the spiciest of our selections, and the adults in our group agreed it was well spiced without being too spicy at all.The ambiance is fun and eclectic. There is a private table in a cave-like room, a few tables with outdoor seating, a table and chairs decorated for royalty, and a neat round table in the turret area of the building.Service was prompt and pleasant. Reservations are required and appropriate. Prices are reasonable, with our meal coming to about C$100 total for a party of four. Enjoy the meal-we did!"
/user_details?userid=IjaR8Od7mkyy3pD_kYHGjA,Joy F.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant has been on my list since last winter because it's the first Thai restaurant that I know in Montreal, so I came there with a high expectation. Since we didn't make our reservation, we are told that we have to wait for a long time for the table or we could sit at the bar. Emmm this restaurant is very popular!!!!!-Pineapple cocktail.I chose it for its attractive appearance, however, when it came to its flavor i can only give 2.5/5. The reason is that I couldn't taste any pineapple in it and the rum was too strong at the beginning and I have to wait until the ice melted and the drink was finally smooth enough to drink. I think adding some pineapple purée will give a nicer and more refreshing taste.-Tom yum soupJust right spiciness and competitively generous amount of seafood in that pot of heart warming soup. However, I was expecting more umami and sourness in the soup to give me a kick. Overall, it's 4.5/5.-Special comboGrilled pork- the best thing of it was that i could taste the flavor brought by the reaction between pork fat and the flame but the pork itself was not marinated enough so it's not very tender. And it became chewy when it generally cooled down. I like the flavor but texture has to be improved. 3.5/5.Papaya salad- Crunchy and refreshing, but the acidity was not enough so it couldn't bring enough freshness after you eat the pork, and personally I think it's too sweet. Good point of this salad was that they added dried shrimps to it so you can actually taste a different type of saltiness. 3.8/5.Glutinous rice plays the connecting rule when you are trying to eat all the thing in this combo together. It cut down the sweetness of the salad.-Pad ThaiI must admit that when I couldn't take my eyes off it the second it came out of the kitchen. The standard that I used to judge if the pad thai is a good one is the aroma of the wok. It's the flavor and smell that a really hot wok and speedy cooking process brought. In this case, it's good enough. However, this dish is too sweet for us thus we asked them if they had the seasoning such as chili powder, fish sauce and spicy vinegar. It became better after we added the lime juice and a little bit vinegar and a lot of chili powder. The bartender who standing right in front us looked so surprised when he saw us doing so. If you considered yourself as a spiciness mania, you can add the chili powder because it brings an aroma that alleviates the sweetness. 4.8/5.Overall, the dining vibe is comfortable and taste of food is on standard. Recommended for those who want to give a try on Thai food and living in Montreal."

I reserved a table for two to celebrate my birthday and at the last minute another couple who was celebrating a birthday too wanted to join us - we called and the girl at the reception did us a very big favour the night before our reservation and was able to squeeze us in ! She  gave us the best table right in front of their decorative wall. Our waitress explained to us that this is a restaurant where you share plates so we decided to get quite a few plates since we had a big appetite. We ordered one bucket to share between three of us that were drinking on the table and it really did remind me of Thailand. We had the roasted duck salad which was very good but extremely spicy so not for the faint hearts - not recommended if you can't handle spicyness. We decided to try all of the bites so we had to gyoza , Bangkok rolls , the crispy shrimp and the chicken satay. I enjoyed the crispy shrimp's  wrapped up in the egg noodles - was very interesting and very delicious. However as for the rest they were very plain - I would not order again. We then ordered a soup which was delicious - Tom kha kai. Very impressedThen we had the green curry which was phenomenal probably my favourite dish of the night. We also ordered the pad Thai - not impressed and would not get again. We had the crispy pork belly. This was very good too. One of my favorite dishes was the pineapple fried rice - so tasty I loved the sweetness of it. At the end of the dinner the waitress brought two desserts one for my birthday and one for my friends birthday one of them was the crème brûlée and the other one was the mango pudding - both the desserts were so delicious !! I was very impressed because I don't usually like deserts. All in all I would definitely go back very soon - the service was sometimes a bit long but totally worth it."

A bit fishy as only one other party outside partook in the experience. Second- beware of the experience. It is a lot of work as you have to cook your own meal. When they turned on the grill the flame burst out almost burning a hole in my father's neck. If you come to a resto to enjoy some Thai food the experience isn't for you unless you are a certified Thai cuisinier. Third, so in addition to the experience we ordered some other plates a la cate. The veggie spring rolls very tres delicious(not too greasy). However the chicken pad Thai needed some kick. It tasted blander then bland(so if you order it ask them to spice it up a notch)."

We arrived without reservations at 7:30 on a Thursday night, with the restaurant full and looking at a minimum half-hour wait. Instead, we asked if they could open the patio for us, and by the time we finished eating there, the patio was full of happy diners too. Pro tip: make reservations."

Every item on the menu is to share so it's better to come here in groups. The pineapple fried rice and yellow chicken curry is also really good. Im definitely coming here again to try other things from the menu like the penang curry and to have their lab kai again.

The duck salad was quite spicy, but really tasty. I believe it was just the right level of spiciness (might be too spicy for most people). Chicken skewers were tender and juicy. Tom yum soup had a lot of seafood and tasted amazing. The pork belly was a bit tough, but I still liked the texture (a mix of very soft and harder bits). The yellow curry was also really good, but i would have preferred it if the potatoes were cut in bite size pieces (easier to share).

Mae Sri is for groups of 2-3 for something more casual.Overall great place but a kind of overpriced. Good for special occasions.The service is spot-on and both our waiter and bus boy were on top of it and really friendly. Cocktails were nice but not very strong.

I tried it and immediately did not like it, I had other people try it at my table, and it wasn't just me. I told the server I did not like it and he asked if I had Thai iced tea before.... Really? I said I drank it all the time. He asked if I wanted more condensed milk or cream, I said no. So he said I didn't have to drink it and took it away, also took it off the bill. He came back with pineapple drinks for us to try and it was good (that was a plus).Tom yum soup (1/5): This was extremely salty. Like I was pouring salt down my throat.

It was alright with the peanut sauce.Pamika Pad Thai (2.5/5): This decent, but a little too sweet.

This restaurant was recommended to me by many friends who've visited Thailand as well (and whose taste I sort of trust) but unfortunately, this place has also disappointed me in terms of authenticity. We ordered Lab Kai (Chicken Salad), Chicken Green Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Chicken Satay. Lab Kai maintained its level of spicy which I appreciate but the texture did not match the Lab Kai I had in Thailand and other places in Asia. The taste lacked a hint of lime and lemon grass but out fresh chilli which was a good touch. Green Curry was not my favourite. It was sort of bland. I liked the pineapple fried rice, I think best dish among all that we ordered. Satay was all right.We thoroughly enjoyed Thai Bucket of alcohol (we had Gin + Sprite). Alcohol level was good.

If you are used to great spicy Thai food from the west coast, this might be a bit of a disappointment--one which could be remedied by ordering extra spicy? The decor and service are fantastic--and the reason why I would be happy to try again and add to this review. It is busy though, so make sure you have reservations or are willing to sit at the small bar.I ordered the Tom kah gai and unfortunately, while seemingly filled with ingredients, the flavors were simply not profound and the spice was very flat.I also ordered the Pad Thai, which was a little more flavorful but not spicy at all. Just not like the flavor and spice explosion I have found in rambles through San Francisco and Los Angelos.That said, it is the best Thai food I've found in Montreal...and from looking at the other reviews, it's probably one of the best in the city.

This was my first order at a Thai place that didn't include pad thai as I wanted to try something new. I am so glad I did, I have been on a Panang Curry kick the last few months and have even attempted making it at home. This place really is a gem."
/user_details?userid=dVOSa0M5TDrwYgslQXaqSA,Bob C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally, an authentic Thai resto in Montreal!Instead of the usual dumbing down of Thai food with loads of sugar and not enough unique flavours, Pamika delivers the real deal. Anyone can do good Pad Thai, basically the Thai equivalent of hotdogs in North America; big deal. Who cares about backpacker $1/day food? Pamika comes through with the subtleties and complexities of real Thai cooking, with none of the compromises of most local places. The yum wun sen (glass noodle-seafood salad) is beautifully executed, with a perfect balance of flavours and textures. Apart from homemade, this is easily the best I've had outside of Thailand. Their Issan som tam (green papaya salad from Issan province) is something nobody else does in Montreal, an Eastern Thai take on the standard. Some might find it a little too fishy with the prominent ""funk"" of rarely used Thai fish paste, but they also offer a regular som tam on the menu. The duck salad was a wonderful surprise, scooped up in napa leaves. And their sticky rice was cooked to perfection, as opposed to a gummy, globular mass.Also, cocktails. Wow!We'll definitely be back soon to delve deeper into the menu."

I highly recommend to make reservation ahead (especially for terrace seating) as it would get packed quick. We ordered chicken satay, Red curry seafood and mango sticky rice. All the dishes are delicious and filling! We were two, so one appetizer and one main dish was sufficient enough to share. For drinks, I ordered a Bangkok delight (served in a pineapple ) and my friend had ordered a Thai Boxer. We both preferred Bangkok delight but Thai boxer is refreshing. Our waiter and busboy were kind and friendly, both explained well when we had questions. Overall, my friend and I enjoyed it and we will definitely go back. Our waiter suggested to come in a bigger group next time and try the bbq special (only for terrace seating)."

I normally steer away from ordering pad Thai because many restaurants make this dish on the sweeter side which I prefer it to not be. The spicy level we ordered was one step below the super crazy Thai spicy. I am so glad I did because the dish was truly spicy and we were sweating by the time we finished.The pineapple drink was amazing! It was this cocktail they made inside a pineapple so we looked pretty cool drinking out of it. Tom yum is another good entree to try especially with the cooler weather. I wasn't a fan of the papaya salad though..it was too salty and not sour/spicy enough. Overall, love this place and would recommend it!"

We had a 7:30pm reservation on the Sunday of the long weekend, and they had to turn others away at the door. Being a smaller restaurant, I would highly suggest reservations. It was 100% worth it to plan ahead for this food.We ordered chicken pad Thai, yellow curry, pineapple rice, cashew nut chicken and spring rolls. Everything was delicious, my personal favourite being the pineapple rice and chicken pad Thai. The yellow curry was also very flavourful. One of our group had never tried any Thai food prior to this trip and she loved it! Everyone in the group was very impressed."

Also, it was packed when I went thereI've started with a drink, a Thai milk tea. It's not for everyone, they put a lot of condensed milk, but I would say it was ok for me.How it works is that all the foods are to be shared. We had a papaya salad, a tom yum soup, crispy shrimp wrapped with noodles and pineapple chicken fried rice. Portions were big enough for two.Food was ok, nothing exceptional, and service was good. I was served quite quickly contrary to other people. There are not a lot of Thai restaurants in Montreal so I really wanted to try this place. At about 70 dollars for 2 it's a bit pricey, so I would say, give it a try, at least one time."

Good we had a reservation.It is a casual place, with a very cosy atmosphere, with wall statues. We were seated at the round wooden table , not very comfortable. The couch was slippery. In addition, there was some delays in serving the food. Besides that, our evening was perfect. The diner was great. We ordered around 7-8 dishes , here are some details. The tum tai salad was so fresh and crunchy. The pad tai, one of the best in montreal. We also had the fried shrimp and spring rolls as starters. For the hot dishes, the chicken cashew, the pineapple fried rice and the seafood red curry where really good. Regarding the drinks, we ordered the Bangkok delight. It is a drink that comes in a fresh pineapple. Lets no forget to mention the impeccable service. The host and waiters were professional. We even had a visit from the manager asking for our feedback and opinion. I do recommend this restaurant as it s one of the best tai restaurant in montreal."

There were nobody to great us as several staff/waiters walked by us, so that felt unwelcoming plus i had a reservation. Restaurants are often under staffed. The food on the other hand was pretty good. We had the house special which was the popular combo papaya salad: it was good but because I went to Thailand, I found they were not crunchy but saggy and they put way too much peanut in the mixture. The flavour was good enough. It came with the pork chop in a soy sauce marinade that was delicious, it's a must have. Although we never had it in Thailand. We also ordered the red curry seafood, the flavour was so on the spot, I'm not crazy about frozen squid throw in there but the shrimps were ok, not the wild ones with tons of flavour. I would go back to try a couple other plates. Small menu, easy to order."

The drink menu is exciting and tastes amazing. The food it just really depends on you. I didn't enjoy the assumption from our waiter that since we look non-Asian most things were made very bland and non-spicy without asking us. I've lived in Asia for over 5 years which is probably longer then he has I can handle my spice. The red curry was spot on, but the pad Thai was an absolute fail it was SWEET! Pineapple  rice was also a miss due to its blandness. This is why sadly they get three stars. It's ok to keep your food authentic and just don't have pre-assumptions about your customers we will tell you straight up if we cannot handle the spice !"

We had to wait a dozen of minutes, for the previous group to finish. We got seated inside, in the left corner with stony walls, around a round table, which is cozy by the way and looked great for our group. However the leather seats were too high, and our feet were pending with nothing to support them. We were slipping all night long, this was very uncomfortable.An hour after ordering food it finally came! The waiter and the manager apologized, they were very friendly, they visited our table regularly to check everything. Finally, food was yummy; we ordered a special group menu; Pamika Tum Thai (Green papaya, dried shrimps, carrots, fresh chilies, roasted peanuts), Crispy shrimps (Fried shrimps wrapped in egg noodles), Pamika Pad Thai (Chicken, rice noodles, tofu, chives, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts), Chicken Cashews (Chicken, red and green peppers, onions, cashew nuts), Pineapple Fried Rice (Chicken, carrots, tomatoes, onions, fresh pineapple), Red curry seafood (Shrimps, calamaris, Thai basil, kaffir leaves, red peppers, coconut milk)."

I love their evening menu concept - it is designed in a way you can share your food or ordering for 2 people and more. We ordered a variety of items: the Tom Kha Kai soup - so smooth and refreshning, Pad Thai - balanced flavors, not too spicy and not too sweet, a set of Thai pork chops - very delicious, perfectly cooked, and lastly, their famous Bangkok delight - beautiful presentation for a drink, not too strong, neither too sweet. Pay attention to the spicy levels on the menu... the pork chops plate was accompanied with a papaya salad, which contained bits of red chilis, and I accidentally ate it - very spicy! Their amabiance is nice, but perhaps a little too dark for me. I wish there was a bit more light in the place, and considering for a Thursday night - it was very noisy. The place is relatively small in size, so it can get crowded or full quite easily. Unfortunately, there is no private parking as well, there are some parking spots available on the same street of the restaurant or not too far away around the block. Overall, I would definetely recommend Pamika Brasserie! Great place to bring a bunch of friends and hang out over some delicious food, so worth it!"

/user_details?userid=dmprdDTSUebCPeTBGFxu5Q,Patrick E.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,"With such great reviews, I expected this to be the best Thai food in Montreal. Making reservations online and over the phone seemed impossible the night of and was geared more toward days in advance. Parking was a nightmare and it took quite some time to finally find a street spot to park at. Upon entering, service was swift and wonderful. The interior was decorated beautifully with Thai decorations and there was a dark, romantic ambiance about the place.  Neatest thing here were the candles that appeared to be lighted despite being fake. The traditional Thai iced tea was good but the classic Thai shake was too creamy. Despite having chunks of pineapple in it, the flavors did not come through.  We started with the Som Tum Talay. The dish included a lot of seafood but the flavors did not absorb well with the dish. Also, the papaya was cut as slabs, not shredded, which seemed very lazy. Especially because the papaya salad had barely any papaya in it. It was more like a seafood salad with papaya on top. The Mama Tom Yum's broth was inconsistent even though we stirred it several times before eating. The top of it tasted like water and bean sprouts. The middle tasted sour and flavorful. The bottom was too sour and left a bad aftertaste. The Chicken Larb was just overly spicy and sweet. They missed the mark on this dish when they left out salty and sour ingredients. The chicken was shredded too which was disappointing. Chicken satay and Yum Neau both tasted okay. Nothing in here was bad but despite the reviews, nothing was amazing either."

Don't believe the hype. By U.S. standards this is very middle of the road, standard Westernized Thai food.  Our bartender repeatedly warned us about how spicy and special the food we were about to try was, and it...wasn't.  Red seafood curry and green chicken curry were both tasty but pretty standard in spite of all the pretension.  There were no exotic herbs or sweat-inducing chilies showcased. These were just good mild-to-medium coconut curries like even *I* can make at home with a can of Mae Ploy paste.  Everything was tasty enough though.  The green curry includes winter melon, which if you haven't had it, is very delicious -- kind of like a watery potato or piece of yucca.  The seafood in the red curry was delicately cooked and not rubbery; both dishes would have benefited from more vegetables and fresh herbs and garnishes.  Unless you're interested in sweet-sounding tiki cocktails, the alcohol menu is fairly limited.  The (admittedly drunk) bartender was bragging about how the most renowned mixologist in the city designed the cocktail list, but honestly, nothing appealed.  We did enjoy some coconut ice cream for dessert, which I suspect is a concession to Western palates and not actually native to Thailand.Bottom line: better Thai is to be had in Washington, DC, New York City, etc. So don't get your hopes up.  This is just nice, average, slightly overpriced fare."

This place was on the top of the list. The location's pretty central considering Sherbrooke's one of the main boulevards.The service wasn't what we expected because we were forced to turn away, due to the lack of seating. Make sure you have a reservation! We were back a couple nights later and noticed how top-notch and accommodating the service can be. The prices aren't too complementary to the portions, unfortunately. For example, the PAD THAI (ooooh my god, please don't get me started, I love this dish everywhere. Ya gotta be able to make this dish anywhere).Now, the other noticeable quality for Pamika is the taste, and how authentic it is. Our taste buds were all over the place, such that the ecstasy had us saying at one point that this is the best Thai restaurant in Canada. My Thai girlfriend agreed it was as traditional as you can get, without actually being in Thailand. It's really 4.5 stars, because of the smaller portion. But, you can't really go wrong here."

This was easily the most disappointing meal we ate in Montreal.Yes, this place nails the superficial things: it's a gorgeous interior, a lovely porch with a view, and the presentation of the food is stellar. But all that glitters is not gold. The food is bland and overpriced. This was the worst pineapple fried rice I've ever had. It just tasted like buttery rice and was almost totally devoid of the spices that give it color and flavor and make it my standard go-to dish at Thai restaurants. The Pad Thai was also unimpressive. And if you can't do a couple of core-menu dishes well, what are you doing selling Thai food at all?The signature cocktail epitomizes Pamika: it looks beautiful when it arrives, but then you realize it's just a bunch of gold flakes and ice and a pineapple core with hardly any liquid and certainly not enough alcohol to stop the flood of regret you have from wasting one of your few dinners in Montreal at this place.Bottom line: Pamika prizes style over substance. The food is bad, the prices are high, and it's not worth your time. Don't fall into this tourist trap."

/user_details?userid=S5oMD5z3sQ2K93UunjBBUQ,Clara V.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,So good!!!!!!!Authentic Thai cuisine but with a really relax and modern vibe and really good drinks. One of the few dinners I've had where every dish we ordered was amazing! We got the papaya salad and tom kha as aps and they were to die for and also quite big and so very worth it price wise. For mains we got the pad Thai and the pineapple fried rice which were also amazing. Staff was super nice and outgoing and customer service was great- they brought our drinks a bit late and so they offered them on the house which was so nice ! 100% recommend!

/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I hate to give negative reviews but this time I believe most of the favorable yelps have it wrong. There is nothing bad about Pamika but the food is very pedestrian. We tried a few of the dishes that a lot of the yelpers were raving about ;the cashew chicken,Pad thai ;and pineapple fried rice. They all were on a par with your average Thai fast food take-away and if anything these dishes tasted overly sweet. We had the highly recommended pineapple cocktail which helped to bring on a sugar rush. I've waited a few weeks to write this review because I may have been a bit hyperactive after eating here..but my initial impressions have not changed. I gave it 3 stars but  its more like 2.5 and 2 stars would be too harsh. There is Way better Thai food almost everwhere else in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=MMKknEw3lR1hZ1-SpORFHw,Diana L.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,"Pamika used to be 5 stars. Unfortunately, like many restaurants, it seems they have lost their delicious food to go more North American. What used to be delightfully flavourful is now without any spice. The same dishes my friends and I had enjoyed over the last 5 years and excited to go to this restaurant for were just bland and sugary rather than spicy. On top of it the waiter we had was rather gross trying to flirt with our table by insulting us when clearly none of us were interested. He told us the items rated 4 in spicy would be too strong. A few years ago this would of been the case, this last time those rated 2 for spice barely had spice we could taste. If you like typical North American Thai then this will still be fine for you. If you're looking for an authentic experience without greasy waiters you may want to go elsewhere."

Ask for a Thai ice tea, and add a little dark rum if you're up for it. The bartenders are very nice and accommodating, and they even gave us sips of extra drinks he was making without charge. As with all authentic Thai food, it is very spicy, but you are able to order it from 0 to 5 spice level so that you can get exactly what you want within your tastes."

I know it sounds cliche, but some experiences just make you feel that way and this was one of them. food: if you've had good Thai places in the west coast, this place is good enough to be edible. it's definitely not bad, and surely worth a try; but, it's definitely not worth coming back to. also, their Thai tea is awful. Wayyyyyyyyyy too milky/creamy, there's barely any Thai tea taste to it. if you're coming from a place where you have endless Thai food choices; you'll definitely be disappointed with this place. however, if you're thai palate is limited to the Montreal area then you MAY enjoy the food.

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is exceptional! The only reason I'm deducting one star is because some of their dishes are too spicy to eat. However, they do warn you about that on the menu and the waitstaff do the same. The service here is awesome. A server is constantly refilling your water glass and are very helpful in describing the special(s) and suggesting items. Last night I went for dinner around 8:30 pm with a reservation I made earlier in the day. It's a small and dimly lit restaurant, perfect for a nice date or even for a small group of people. They have some special tables for larger groups and outdoor seating when the weather permits. For three people, we ordered the larger Tom Yum Soup, the fried fish special of the day, the pineapple fried rice, and the Seafood Red Curry. All of them were absolutely delicious and not too spicy. The soup was full of citrus and cilantro, the fried fish was glazed in orange and delicious with the accompanying green mango salad, the pineapple fried rice was mild and served in a pineapple, and the red curry was my favorite- flavorful with spices but not too spicy. In the past, I have gotten the green curry which is FIRE! The ambiance is lovely, the service is 5 stars, the food is delicious, and the price is reasonable. I will definitely return to Pamika for all my Thai cravings."

/user_details?userid=wpEN58XWUkvdyqdEnPuNVQ,Kara B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"In the spirit of fairness I will state that my first visit was pleasant and both my friend and I enjoyed our dishes and had great service.But this is not what has prompted me to write a review. I arrived this evening at 9:50 asking if there was still time to place an order to go, and I was told yes. I then placed my order but waited in the foyer telling the server that I had just played a soccer game and might not be so fresh to be in the main area. He told me no problem and I heard him relay the specifics of my order to the kitchen.And then I waited. A simple pad thai order, but it was nearing the end of the night so I wasn't going to be fussy. At 10:26 I decided to leave (they close at 10:30) as I leaned forward and saw that the kitchen staff were in fact cleaning and not cooking my order. During this time there were roughly 10 separate occasions where a staff member had come in the same area as me to put something away. Not one person had spoken to me since I placed my order.When I left I ultimately felt pissed off and offended that perhaps it was my younger demeanour that caused them to ignore me. To this I can only speculate, but when it comes to my personal finances I can say this: if you can't be bothered to serve me, then you don't deserve my money."

It's an incredibly cozy 14 seat venue with an equally tiny exposed kitchen in which the restaurant's namesake, Pamika recreates with amazing accuracy and authenticity the traditional fare of her homeland. After a long day of driving to Montreal from NJ, my husband and I were famished. We ordered the cashew nut chicken and the pad thai. The pad Thai was amazing and the portion was hearty but the real star of the meal was the cashew chicken. Being a foodie, this means a lot coming from me - the cashew chicken at Pamika was the best meal I've ever eaten!!! Absolutely out of this world amazing!!! The service was kind and friendly (we were so grateful that the waiter spoke perfect English and that they provided us with English menu's instead of the French menu posted outside the restaurant). All in all - I couldn't have asked for a better experience for our first dinner in Montreal!! The Experience at Pamika Thai brasserie did not disappoint!!!"

Spiciest thing I've eaten in a while with all the peppers cooked atop the pork. Server saw me dying and was nice enough to bring over a side of rice to help tame my burning flavour palette.Pad thai is a very peanutty but tasty version, not the ketchupy or overly tamarind based flavours most places offer up. After the first dish I think the server was suprised I still wanted hot sauce on it. Maybe closer to a 3.5 star eating experience but the friendliness of the staff made up for it, and there does seem to be a lack of thai food in this area of the city."

This place is small (just a few tables, best for groups under 4 people) although I suppose in the summer the patio increases their capacity. The vibe is intimate and cozy. Food may take a while to arrive, but it's worth it. Presentation is excellent (fried rice served in a pineapple, tom yum soup served in a coconut!) and the dishes are flavourful, with a really good amount of spice. I really loved the spicy chicken salad with lettuce leaves. The menu is small with some interesting dishes, not just your usual standard Thai dishes that you see everywhere. Be sure to see what the daily specials are. Service when I went was excellent and thoughtful - definitely no attitude from the server regarding my subpar French!

Although, having been to Thailand, I couldn't help but compare the food. The Tom Kha Gai was perfect, sour and not to rich from the coconut milk. Unfortunately, the pork in sweet and sour sauce was overcooked and dry but the sauce was good! Also, the pad thai noodles were overcooked as well but the sauce was really delicious and authentic like the one in Thailand. The homemade iced lemonade tea (it's orange), is a ""must-try""! Finally, there was only a choice of sorbet for dessert, which wasn't phenomenal, I wouldn't have minded the traditional fried ice cream or fried banana. I haven't tried that many Thai restaurants in Montreal, all in all, I would recommend it to try, perhaps the other meals executed to perfection, but wouldn't go again before a really long time."

We were explained about the restaurant, a simple tradition (i.e. to share all dishes and bringing all meals, all at once) and the special dish of the day. All meals were finely plated and decorated. They were filled with fresh, tasty, and distinctly flavored ingredients. Our choices were: Pamika Tum Thai, Crispy Shrimps, and Pineapple Fried Rice; Our choice of dessert was Mango with Sticky Rice and we had a cocktail (Bangkok Delight). I'll definitely try this resturant again and will recommend to my friends.My only dissatisfaction is the waiter! She was quite nice but rushed us into ordering, taking unfinished dishes, and speeding us into ending of this fine experience as quickly as possible!!! The resturant was not busy and perhaps half empty; therefore even I could not imagine any reason why :)"
/user_details?userid=CHZ43Pb0wLGAWM8tbblkng,GM L.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,"Although, the ambiance and atmosphere with the friendly staff were all pluses, the food was not. Thai food is a very flavorful food that lets your palate take a short vacation to Thailand while sitting at your table enjoying your food. I am astonished that most reviews rated this place as the best Thai place in Montreal. I have been to Thailand more than I can count, and the food here, was nothing to rave about, in my opinion. Get better chefs who know what real Thai food should taste like and this place will be wall to wall each and every day. Went here on a Wednesday night and there was only 1 other table besides ours who were dining. I really looked forward to having our dinner here and so wanted to love this place, but the experience with regards to the food itself, was just not here."
/user_details?userid=26gmLLL4n5347t6ZV3hf2g,Caroline D.,"Sarasota, FL",4 star rating,"Ordered for delivery, got the papaya salad and the panaeung curry with beef. I asked on the phone about the difference between the two listed papaya salads,and he explained that they don't recommend the one to Westerners (forgot which one, esan or siam), which I thought was cute, so I said I will go with the normal one then and maybe try the other one next time. Well, I certainly won't, as the one I've gotten was definitely hot and flavourful enough for me. Authentic tho, with the tiny shrimps, peanut halves and some tomatoes slices and nice dressing.The meat in the curry was tender and good,the sauce was rich and creamy. The basil and turkey berries just gave that little extra authenticity and well rounded flavours. It came with white rice (at no extra charge). Will order from there again. Delivery was fast."
/user_details?userid=VDWiTOQZqDxAwmSNeS3Nbw,Andrew G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Perhaps the best Thai food I've ever had. And I've had a lot. A unique spin on every dish that made me wonder, ""Maybe this is how the dish is actually meant to be prepared!"" and brought into question all Thai food I've had previously. The Tom Yum soup comes in an actual coconut, which is always fun because you can scoop the coconut meat off the inside. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=rlWqllUqgpWK067GPp6_0w,Christine S.,"Underhill, VT",3 star rating,"The real fun for us was experiencing Thai food in Canada vs. the U.S. and getting dishes with ingredients different than what American Thai places feature, like tapioca noodles and Thai sausage.  That said, none of the four dishes we ordered was really a knockout.  The gyoza, fried dumplings with a ground pork filling, had a very good tasty filling and were nicely fried; but were still just a basic fried Asian appetizer.  The larb, a Thai chicken salad, was just too intense, both spice-wise (two warning peppers on the menu) and also with the level of sourness and herbs.  The shrimp fried rice was a nice, thick, sticky rice dish, but not a dish to stand on its own; and the soup, featuring soft-boiled egg, tapioca noodles, Chinese greens and ""Thai sausage,"" was a tasty Cantonese-style soup, but bland for Thai food.  The ""Thai sausage"" didn't seem to me to be anything more than meatballs made of ground chicken.  We were lucky to be seated on a busy Saturday night, and the service was harried but apologetic, failing to bring us the second beer we ordered, for example.  A fine experience, but I think we could have done better."

The only thing I would have liked is a bit more explanation of what kind of restaurant it was before ordering. It's set up like an authentic Thai meal, so platters are ordered and shared with the table. Very good overall though! Would recommend!!"

/user_details?userid=1IlAUJUVLAUygMiNvavDxg,Nicholas S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Keeping this short...went for my first time on Monday (February 1st, 2016) because of a recommendation by tripadvisor. The place was small and cozy, nothing terribly special, but the food was absolutely amazing. We tried three dishes that our waiter recommended, the warm noodle salad, the pad thai, and the green curry chicken, all of which were out of this world flavourful and delicious. I left full yet there was still more I saw and wanted to try so I will 100% be going back and bringing friends with me!"
/user_details?userid=KBdc2sm7guaGlp1E6X68AA,Jenna M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"My husband and I had the place to ourselves on a snowy Sunday night. The atmosphere is cozy, modern, and inviting. We had the jab soup, chicken with cashews, and the pad thai. Two of these dishes would have been enough for the two of us - the portions are generous. The soup and the chicken were my favorites - very flavorful and unqiue. The pad Thai is good too, not amazing though (note: it's not sweet like a typical pad thai). Great waiter, reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=aC8jVak49WCqzB3vFVGDtw,Hannah M.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"Our last night in Montreal and we were craving some good Thai food. My husband and I found this place on Trip Advisor and then cross referenced reviews, which were all good so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is tiny (when paying the bill we noticed the kitchen was a dorm-sized one-woman operation!) and we sat outside on the deck at a table overlooking the street. Our waiter was super nice and was helpful as we were undecided about what to order. We decided on a noodle soup, a chicken salad, and a shrimp dish (our server did warn that this might be too much food but eyes tend to be bigger than stomachs). They came out one a time and we were never rushed or felt like we were waiting to long. The flavors in each dish were excellent. All the veggies were fresh, flavorful, and cooked just right. The soup was thick, which I hadn't expected but still very good. The chicken was very spicy, which we like. My husband didn't prefer the shrimp dish, it was a bit too sweet for his tastes but I enjoyed it. Anyway, taken together the atmosphere, service, and food created a 5 star experience for us! Oh and I forgot to mention my pineapple drink! Delish (see pic)!!"
/user_details?userid=GwkE5ALitVrwVwJipQLfog,rohit s.,"Summit, NJ",4 star rating,One of the best Thai places in town.. very nice and cozy restaurant with limited but great outdoor seating..severs are very prompt and polite and the food awesome ..I do take away the 0.5 stars cause while the pineapple drink served is awesome it hardly has alcohol ..I bet it would do them good to label it is a virgin pineapple drink ...but worth tasting nonetheless ..

We had never been to Montreal and we found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. We lucked out and found the food to be amazing, the atmosphere cozy and the owners were nothing but welcoming and fun. We will definitely go back next time we are in Montreal. Our favorite dishes were the Tom Yum soup and the sauteed vegetables with shrimp."
/user_details?userid=CnYBxtTOySENBuixsc3vqw,Matthew S.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"Skip the mama's Tom yum, unless you like a package of ramen thrown into a bowl with a few shrimp added for $11. The pad Thai was edible but forgettable. Too bad too. I had high hopes based on other reviews."

/user_details?userid=nk4pr3GytIe9fy6MuF0kMg,Ian M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This newly opened restaurant offers some great authentic Thai cuisine.  The young owners are really nice and the cook is a recent immigrant from Thailand, so you know it's authentic.  I highly recommend the spicy chicken soup.  It's fairly sweet and spicy, with a deliciously complex flavor.  The bar is decent, for $12 you can have the Bangkok Delight, a rum cocktail with mango puree and Thai basil served in a pineapple.  It's f---ing delicious and refills are just $5.  It's a tiny spot, so make a reservation."
/user_details?userid=Z1GXKmVR8CpHwETcLBBIdA,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Small but cozy space and personable staff that really did try their best to make our experience a good one. Unfortunately the kitchen didn't deliver on its potential - especially given the other positive reviews. Started off some pleasant cocktails.  Tom Yum soup was delicious filled with seafood. Papaya salad was incredibly spicy despite discussing level of spice tolerance - even my friend who enjoys spicy food had trouble with the dish and we resorted to chewing ice cubes for a few minutes to recalibrate or taste buds.  The wait staff did their best to accommodate and offered a spiceless replacement which was rather salty.  Chicken cashew dish chicken was very dry but I could taste the potential of it had it been not overcooked.  I can imagine it could be a better experience during the summer when their outdoor grill is working but our experience was unfortunately rather a grim one.

/user_details?userid=7td7UDP4lgadr98mT0nKuQ,Ramya Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,"This place deserves 6/5 starts. I am on a trip to Montreal with my husband for 4days. After a long drive from NY we were very tired and hungry. We got this place through yelp and went directly without any reservation. So we had a place opposite to bar. Even though we don't drink, we felt very comfortable and coming to food it was so delicious. We ordered omelet, pine apple fried rice in which they keep chicken fried rice in a pine apple. Also we had a soup which tasted very good. I highly recommend this place to dine in. Their service and everything is very good !!"
