They have multiple pot and flavour to combine with. Longer the pot brews, spicier it can be.For the price, it's average. $40 per person.Some ingredients you have to pay to have. They have free soup on the counter."

Location is convenient, right next to the Bay downtown that you can get here via public transport. The place is large with ample seating. No reservations needed. When I went, they still were under a soft opening so they were in the midst of still working out Reno's. The concept is simple, they give you a menu you pay around 40$ (with tax) for all you can eat meats, seafood, veggies. Quantity wise - they are pretty generous. They also offer a side buffet area where you can get unlimited egg rolls, fried chicken, seaweed salad and oranges. They didn't have an alcohol permit when I went but that may have changed. Authentic fun place, I would come back for a round 2. Recommended for the meat lovers!"

Then you add the cost of the soup on top of that. Unless it's packed you have the option of taking a table with large pots or small pots. The cheapest is $5 for the original pork bone broth (small pot). $7 for the spicy one (small pot). Big pots are more. On a Monday night I got the spicy broth in a small pot and it was pretty spicy. Don't be surprised if you have ""fire in the hole"" afterwards if you get this broth. There are some other broths like mushroom, tomato, and chicken.Most things you order by marking them off on the paper menu but it's a mystery how much 1 order of something is until you get it. 1 order of things like lamb, beef and pork belly is a whole plate of meat slices. But then proteins like quail eggs, whole shrimp with the head, mussels, clams and frog legs are are 1 piece per order. Squid may have been 2 pieces per order. There is also shrimp paste, chicken, pork rib and a ""secret recipe"" beef. Overall the proteins were all fresh. The frog legs didn't smell or taste fishy. The secret beef was probably the best thing. Chicken and pork rib were fine but skippable.With regards to noodles you should probably only get 1 order of one type per person as the portion will be plenty for one person. I really liked the knife cut noodles that were very thinly sliced and didn't become soggy even when left in the boiling broth for a long time. They have most typical vegetables including chinese cabbage, watercress and spinach. They also offered king oyster mushrooms and enoki mushrooms. There is also different tofu but I didn't have any of that.There is a separate sauce station with many choices. There's the quintessential sesame sauce, cilantro, garlic, peppers plus several spicy condiments and fermented stuff like black bean. It's all labeled in Chinese though and no English (which either sucks for those who can't read Chinese or is a fun game of russian roulette of randomly combining sauces in hopes of finding a combo that won't taste like a heaping pile of salt or a crying for mama amount of scorching peppers, or both). There's also a small set of cooked stuff. Not really sure what the point of having that is but the fried bread buns and the fried pork were actually good when fresh. There are also slices of orange but the pulp can be a bit dry on the outside if they've been sitting out there for a while.There are many tables in here that can accommodate different sized groups. They have some chairs with super tall backs that are heavy. The induction hot plates are nice and simple. An On/Off button and another button that changes the heat level from 1-3.Service was good and they refilled the soup broth as needed. Although my friend and I did have to specifically ask for strainer spoons to scoop out our cooked food from the pots (try finding that quail egg in your opaque soup without a strainer). These strainers are pretty much essential for hot pot so not sure why they weren't there in the first place. In addition, it would also have been better to have tongs for picking up the raw food (but hey I'm not afraid of salmonella). I would not mind going back one day but hot pot is not something I crave so I could go for a year without it just fine. Maybe if they had a cheaper lunch option with a smaller amount of choices I would more likely go back sooner."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Hotpot Nine (Lao Jiu Men in Chinese) is replacing a Chinese restaurant that was previously there. This place is still in its soft opening, and so was offering 15% off. They are still figuring a few things out. For instance the vestiaire is not available for customers just yet (only staff), but it might be in the future (which would be amazing to avoid coats smelling like hot pot for the next 3 days). The place it not that big, but they managed to arrange quite a few tables in there. And it's already popular! It was pretty much full on both nights I was there. There are large and small pots. Large pots are shared between diners of a given table, as it is usually the case in China. Small pots (individual pots) give more freedom as to which base soup you want, although large pots allow a maximum of 3 different soups! Â The induction cookers were powerful, and the simple electronic pads at each table enabled to easily control boiling. There's quite a few base soups available. So far I tried the ""traditional spicy soupe"", ""health mushroom soupe"", ""original bone soupe"" and ""nourishing health chicken soupe"" (the English names might be a bit puzzling, but they were all tasty). The heat level of the spicy soup was also quite satisfying for us Sichuanese. It is all you can eat, at about 25$ per person. The base soup costs extra, and so do drinks and some select items (e.g. duck blood, beef tongue, etc.). The choice of food items if not the most diverse, but covers most essentials. The main attraction remains meat, in this case AA+ beef and lamb. The mashed shrimp (pureed shrimp that boils into a shimp meatball) was also very popular. Soups and food came fairly fast, and was very nicely displayed. Some items were forgotten on both of my visits, but it didn't affect the overall experience. There's two self-serve stations, one for ready to eats (spring rolls, fried fish (?), oranges, fried buns, etc.) and one for sauces. The sauce station had everything I needed, but was quite messy and in need of replenishing. I also wished the oil would be sesame oil instead of vegetable (?) oil. Ladles and strainers can be found on the shelf under the sauce station. Overall, the taste was excellent, and there was a lot of efforts and good attitude from the staff. The place was still a bit messy and chaotic, and the air was a bit stuffy, given all the steam that is produced. But then again, it's arguably part of an old school hot pot experience!"
