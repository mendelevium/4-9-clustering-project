/user_details?userid=seiETb6DegGn9YjqdGTdig,Karla V.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Highly recommend this place! We got to Montreal early and this is the only place that we found that opened at 6am. The place was spotless and the server was very nice and everything came in pretty fast since we were the only customers. He was also very attentive. The menu was extensive and also interesting, Fried chicken waffle benedict, anyone? I ordered Crepe mon Coco and it was delicious and would love to come back to try other things! My friends and husband are also impressed with their orders, Steak and Eggs with mashed potatoes and Avocado Benedict. PS. Refillable good coffee was also only $1.50."

/user_details?userid=mWcS4rFDDJOVMVuER-Cqzw,Emily P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"So far we had a good streak of amazing breakfast in Montréal and were hoping to continue it at Allô. We walked in and the restaurant looked very much like a diner, kind of similar to IHOP in the US. We were seated after a 5 minute wait in a booth. Their menu is huge and everything involves combinations of bacon, eggs, sausage, ham, toast, potatoes, French toast, waffles and pancakes (I'm sure I'm leaving out some options.) We went with cappuccinos to drink and a Bon Matin and Guzzler breakfast. The food was good and service was pretty prompt despite how busy it was. It was maybe a couple of steps up from an IHOP or a Denny's. I'm not sure if it's always so busy on a Sunday morning or if it was just Pride Parade crowd but it seems to be frequented by many Montréal locals. I would definitely return if I'm ever in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=_YyQF6B2vJqYf1FnCyXv9A,Emile L.,"Edgewater, NJ",5 star rating,One of the best breakfasts I had while staying in the area. Everything is made fresh to order. Portions are on the large side and the prices are reasonable. Service was was also quick and attentive.

Great service, the wiped down a booth for me. Due to the influx of people and limited staff it took a while before getting served. I requested Tobasco sause and they gave me a small cup of hot sauce. I gave the brand name but they substituted for a generic hot sauce"

My 2nd time in Montréal and of course we had to squeeze in a visit at Allô Mon Coco even though we were here for like a day and a half lol shows how much I cannot get enough of this place. First off the decor of this place is super cute, bright and just a fun comfy vibe. The service every time I've been here have always been excellent. Nice people all around. As for the food, I love myself yummy breakfast at an affordable rate and this is what you'll find here. Everything is affordable and their portions are huge and filling. My sister and I are in love with their potatoes, so creamy and tasty. I could eat their potatoes everyday along with their French toast which is just as delicious. I wish they would have give just more than one slice. My cousin and I were seriously contemplating going back the next morning for some more French toast before we heading back to NY. I'm so sad now that we didn't. I also like that they serve beef salami which I don't see at other restaurant. It's so so good and they give a lot. This is my go to spot when I'm in Montréal. I cannot wait to come back for some more of their delicious yumminess."
/user_details?userid=sxBKC2jELQe1HaZ7ABevkw,May T.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is the restaurant you would go-to if you want a little bit of everything. I've always wanted to go to a place where I can have waffles with cream and strawberries and bananas as well as eggs and bacon and home fries. No where in Toronto will you find this and even if you do, it is quite expensive ... But Allo Mon Coco serves this combo to you for a price of $15! Very affordable and it's a bit of everything that you wish for in a breakfast. It's absolutely amazing. And a really great hangover breakfast food. But also a great place for a date as it is so bright inside and people are super friendly with their greetings ! Must go!!!!"
/user_details?userid=tRzn0xStjjWxIaA3_AqzEw,Kara G.,"Plymouth, MI",5 star rating,"We visited Montreal and stayed in Chinatown, and asked the front desk staff for a breakfast recommendation. Without hesitation they recommended this place and it did not disappoint! The wildberry crepe was huge, slightly puffier than you might expect a crepe to be, and filled with a cup of fresh berries and a large amount of whipped vanilla-ey English cream. (A delicious novelty for this American!)My mom raved about her Eggs Benedict and we were amazed at the giant fresh fruit cup that came with it. The cubed potatoes were delicious too. We were there in time for the early bird special which meant my daughter had plain French toast for much less than usual."
/user_details?userid=uIUQqkbMiP51qxSciJWtBA,Steven L.,"Highland Park, NJ",5 star rating,"This is a chain restaurant found mostly in Quebec province specializing in breakfast/brunch. Their motto ""Déjeuner Modernisé"" shows itself in the presentation of their plates. The atmosphere: chill/modern vibeThe menu: expansiveMany options of waffles, french toasts, crepes, eggs, omelettes, benes, as wells as flambés and grilled cheeses. My choice: Le Cochonnet (2 eggs, 2 buckwheat crepes filled w/sausage and cheddar, crazy good potatoes, whole wheat toast, fruit and coffee).It was hard not to give 5 stars. Délicieux."
/user_details?userid=cun967dZl0Q9nMwg_riaIQ,Sam B.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,Great spot in the heart of downtown Montreal. Very large portions so if your hungry and love a big brunch styled meal then this is definitely the place to try. They have all different styles of combinations for breakfast along with regular entrees and lunch items. I even saw a vegetarian section for those who don't eat meat. The staff is also very friendly and service was pretty fast in all aspects.I ordered a new item on the menu called the Roast beef Benedict ($16.95 Canadian) which was a tasty dish. You definitely get your money's worth. The roast beef comes drenched in tasty hollandaise sauce with a delicious balsamic reduction with two poached eggs on top cooked perfectly. Both were placed on top of crispy ciabatta bread and there was a side of delicious home fries. Best part is that it also comes with a large bowl of fresh cut fruits. I added a coffee for an extra $1.50 which was good coffee. Before the coffee I tried this fruit cocktail juice they make from fresh juice ($5.95) which was worth It and delicious as well.Overall I had a great experience here and would definitely come back. Had a huge delicious meal for under $25 (Canadian money). This place is definitely recommended as a must try.
/user_details?userid=P0eTj4azE3vaMkI4mmDFrw,Curt T.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,One word to sum up my experience here....AMAZING. from the food to the service to ambiance....The food is really good...I had the BLT sandwich and it came with tho best potatoes I've ever eaten...my partner got the choco moco which is a banana chocolate crepe...I loved the bananas and chocolate but don't care for crepes but he said it was very good and it must have been cause he ate the whole thing. As with every place in Montreal Thus far the service has been impecable. Fast and friendly which I have come to realize must be a Montreal thing. The restaurant was busy but it didn't slow the speed or friendly service down one bit...our server was smiling and chatted a bit and seemed to really enjoy what she does.Would totally recommend this place to anyone.. the portions are huge so if not too hungry maybe consider sharing a dish.

Let's see what we are javing today. Today we are trying out their specialty dish. It comes with eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, potatoes, beans, some paste thing, a pancake, and toast.I've been craving brunch for a while so I was excited for this. All the food was good but I was not a huge fan of the paste thing. It reminded me of tuna to be honest. The eggs were made well and so were the meats. I would've preferred if the potatoes were a bit crispier though. The pancake was fluffy and had banana in it which was a nice touch.The place looked like a regular brunch place but it was really busy which is a good thing. I was conflicted on which breakfast to pick from as there were so many and our waitress was very helpful in answering my questions.There was so much food on this plate I couldn't finish. I guess those carbs really filled me up. The pricing was similar to what I would get in Toronto but in Toronto sometimes I finish my meal and would have wished for more. This was definitely not the case here.All in all, not only was the food and portion sizes great here, I had a fun time trying to pronounce the name of this place as it was so unique. Really made me feel fancy :). And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"
/user_details?userid=Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",4 star rating,"I had low expectations going in since it's one of multiple locations....and my experiences with chain-like establishments are usually less than stellar.But Allô! Mon Coco should not be missed. First and foremost...it's extremely clean. There's also plenty of seating and the service is very friendly. The only glitch that we experienced was that one breakfast was served at least five minutes prior to the other. That said, I would rather receive hot and fresh food then allow one of the entrées sit under hot lights while the other is being prepared.One of the special omelettes was ordered that contained brie, caramelized apples and bacon. The side of potatoes was a small mountain along with a couple of slices of fresh fruit. Great reviews on said omelette. It was also served with very thick slices of buttered toast and plenty of spreads to slather.I decided to go all out and order a platter of food that had a little bit of everything: banana/chocolate hazelnut crepe, eggs, potatoes, fresh fruit and bacon. Oh yeah, and it's served with a side of toast as well. Sweet and savory? Yep.Everything arrived hot, fresh and cooked to order. (I asked for the potatoes to be a bit more well done and they were..without burning 'em!). Great quality on everything. I would absolutely come back here for breakfast or brunch when I'm back in town.I completely went over my calorie limitation for the day already....but who cares. It's Sunday and I can either pray for redemption or just do a few extra sit ups later.Merci beaucoup!"

Even though it came out with whipped cream and chocolate chips and was a bit too sweet for me, I really enjoyed it. My bf really enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice as well.He got the fried chicken and waffles which came with egg, bacon, potatoes, and toast.I got a plate that came with fried eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, a banana pancake, fluffy white toast, baked beans, and this Canadian version of pork paté.

I only come here for the breakfast and at 6,75$ traditional two eggs-1 meat with the fixings (weekdays before 6am-9am), you can't go wrong. My eggs are always cooked perfectly and the food comes out hot! They are quite generous with the portions as well. Service is fast and courteous yet consistent. I haven't been disappointed so far :)"

Friendly and quick service but not big flavors on the food.  Ordered the fried chicken Benedict which included poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, fried chicken on a 1/2 waffle.  It was ok, came their mom coco potatoes and a large bowl of fruit.  The potatoes had cheese added but were not hot enough to melt the cheese.  The food was ok but nothing exceptional."

Very relaxing.We ordered an Eggs Benedict, Avocado Benedict, and the Deluxe Coco Waffle. Delicious. Simply delicious.The food arrived very quickly. I suppose it wasn't terribly busy. But it was almost shocking. The coffee was delicious and our waitress stopped by just enough to make sure we were ok. My scrambled eggs might have been a tad over cooked. Not very fluffy. But that doesn't bother me. Especially when everything else was so good. I'm very glad this is a chain because it means that I can seek it out whenever I visit Canada. Hello, my Coco."

It doesn't have that cozy mom and pop feel but has tons of breakfast options and lunch as well. The crepes were delicious and the eggs Benedict was also a solid choice. The potatoes are awesome and even better with cheese. Overall the portions were hearty and the food was great especially with a couple mimosas! Rewind to the crepes: I've never had them before but now I'm s true fan!

You don't have to ask for it like other restaurants. I like potatoes but I can't eat a lot of it. A few bites and I'm good. This place has super delicious potatoes. I had 10 spoonfuls of potatoes...twice than my normal quota."

/user_details?userid=Zd3wzNdevk15CwMIJdbjZw,Diana S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"A bigger, rowdier version of Cora's, which is still better. Great for large groups and children. Each establishment is so large that reservations are not really needed even with large groups. Our server was kept extremely busy, but she was so efficient and considerate. Unfortunately the food was less than what I expected with ingredients thrown onto plates sloppily. Pros? Lots of variety and pretty affordable. Cons? Presentation of dishes was very disappointing (Cora's does a much better job with their fruit platter arrangements), portions were smaller than at Cora's, and the potato dishes here are all made with traces of bacon fat, I.e. not vegetarian or vegan friendly."

/user_details?userid=IlvHu0uu8OuHeB8tsKfg3g,Avita T.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Wow this place is expensive for a chain! I came in excited cause there was so much on their menu, and it looked like their sets would be huge portions. I got a scrambled eggs, with a chocolate crepe, toast and breakfast potatoes. Sounds like a lot of food, which it definitely was but just not sure if it was worth $16. First, this place is clearly severely understaffed with one poor waitress running around serving at least 15 or so full tables. It took us just 25 minutes to order cause we couldn't quite catch her attention. In my dish, the chocolate crepe came with bananas and I was hoping to replace it with strawberries, but she said it would've been $4....ridiculous. Our food came relatively quick but the food itself was extremely average. It felt very diner-ish, with the scrambled eggs being pretty overdone. The chocolate crepe kind of cold and not really crispy, and toast overly buttered. Everything was edible, at least.I liked the potatoes the best and think it was the only redeeming factor of this place. The seasoning on them was delicious but didn't mask the fact that they were cold. It was also by far the largest portion on my dish, which was weird as I was expecting it to be well balanced. I had this huge chunk of potatoes. It was nice for a wholesome breakfast but I'm sure there are better places in Montreal with more value for money."

Although it gave us plenty of time to look through the menu which had a lot of pages. It had a section for waffles, crepes, omelettes and combination breakfasts. The potatoes were advertised and a friend recommended them so I knew I had to order them. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with one ingredient. This breakfast included 2 eggs, toast, a side of fruit and potatoes. The one ingredient I added was a pancake. The eggs were done to my liking. The pancake was fluffy as well. The real star on this plate was the potatoes. They were soft with a mashed potato like texture and well seasoned with salt, pepper and dill I believe. They were great on their own or with ketchup. Definitely order the potatoes when you go."

I'm always down for a good brunch and this spot does not disappoint. I always get the special which is $15.99 for 2 eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, potatoes, toast, beans and banana pancakes (which are my fav). The potatoes are really good too - not your usual hashbrowns or homefries... more like a smashed potato but still really good. My friend got the Copenhagen ($16.99) which are egg bennys on smoked salmon on top of english muffins with hollandaise sauce and a side of potatoes and a bowl of fruit. The portions are huge and the menu has a good selection. The service is always on point - no complaints really about the ambiance either."

I ordered something marked as a new menu item because I figured it would be something they tried especially hard to make right. It was a omelette with goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and supposedly shallots and oregano. I specifically asked for the omelette to be cooked light so that it was not brown. The server clearly understood my order. What I got was a brown omelette with a bunch of stringy un chopped green onions, a couple mounds of goat cheese and the tomatoes. It was irritating that they didn't bother to distribute the goat cheese to the entire omelette. And green onions don't taste like shallots regular onions would have been closer. Oregano was completely missing as far as I could tell and I use oregano a lot and grow two different varieties in my garden so I think I would know. I'm embarrassed for the people that give this place 5 stars. By the way I've worked as an egg cook at 4 different restaurants."

We asked for a table for 2, were seated at a 4 seat table with 3 menus. We ordered the Avocado Benedict & Bacon Benedict - both were flavourless. The potatoes were mushy & lukewarm except for a hot spot in the middle - the shredded cheese didn't even begin to melt on the potatoes, nor did the sliced cheese used on the Benedicts. We had to ask another waitress for condiments because nobody asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. I ended up eating only the bowl of fruit that came with my breakfast which was undeniably the best part.Would not return or recommend. The only reason this restaurant got 2 stars & not 1 was because of how clean the dining area was."

We also tried the crepe with fruit and Nutella and English cream and it was delicious.They also have great mimosas! And were willing to make a variation of the options on the menu. The decor was also bright and happy, the service was the friendliest I had anywhere in Montreal.Absolutely a must visit for breakfast/brunch on the weekend or for lunch specials during the week!"

/user_details?userid=lmuvvFzoesF0fAsZ_PkOrg,Claudia G.,"Newark, NJ",5 star rating,"On the recommendation of the hotel, our party visited for breakfast since it was already close to 11 am and most places had stopped serving breakfast for the day.  We were pleasantly surprised at the portions--they are very large and we were able to share two plates for 3 and still had food left to take back to the hotel.  The eggs and crepes were delicious--my mom and aunt enjoyed everything! The coffee is cheap and very good.  Valerie was our server and she was super nice and attentive.  The day we visited was very busy and there was a large party of 15 and we still managed to get our meal within a reasonable time (though they are a bit slow in the kitchen).  If you are looking for just a regular/American breakfast--this is the spot!  We will return when we're back in Montreal.  I recommend it."

/user_details?userid=zIps0vOFSWkceswJs-Ly0g,Kristen W.,"Foxborough, MA",5 star rating,"Best breakfast we've ever had. We ordered the Choco Coco and freshly squeezed orange juice during our first visit there. Incredible. The potatoes are partially mashed and SO good. On our second visit, I got a waffle with strawberries and English cream. Also incredible. The portions are huge and everything is prepared and presented with care. Excellent service as well."
/user_details?userid=mAH2LAyd3e6PvTYHsg4mog,Elissa C.,"East Hartford, CT",5 star rating,This was a cute diner vibe with huge portions of food and decent pricing. Our waiter was really great. There were free coffee refills that were offered regularly. Every single plate came with a giant helping of assorted fresh fruit. (Not just the typical cantaloupe and grapes combo that I hate.) There were like 16 kinds of Eggs Benedict and fresh squeezed juice. Definitely worth every penny!!!

Where do i begin?! this place is incredible. the beef salami is amazing. the french toast amazing. every time my cousins and i come to montreal we come here and its always worth it. the service is always incredible as well. i'll definitely be visiting again soon
/user_details?userid=KGpbq-y4MH_2qwsASFuAzQ,Bee C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Came in a few times for breakfast while on vacation there and the food was great! So much to choose from I had a hard time picking because so much sounded delicious. When we got our food it was better then we thought! All the servers were very friendly and everything was quick to come out. This place is just like a diner but way better! Would definitely return.
/user_details?userid=LYfi8wRgFzYKJj7FXBxF8w,Minda M.,"Soquel, CA",5 star rating,"Visited while traveling to Montreal. This Montreal diner is better than most American restaurants - we enjoyed our food and had a nice, tasty, filling meal. My husband really enjoyed the crepe with berries and English cream.What we appreciated most was that our server was willing to accommodate our language needs, switching over to English for me and even helping my husband  practice his French while he ordered (his idea).Great overall experience."
/user_details?userid=HO2StYuUM7ZMf5waF72LtQ,Alex F.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,Absolutely loved it. The best breakfast place I've ever been to. The portions are massive and the prices are very reasonable. I love the potatoes with cheese and the crepes with fruit and cream are also delicious. Definitely fuel for a whole day. The staff is genuinely friendly and helpful. I went two mornings in a row.
/user_details?userid=mGeKHaXHpxq5KL5rRf00Ug,German G.,"Park Ridge, IL",5 star rating,All I can say is Wow!  The portions at this place were huge.  You are definitely eating brunch and do not need to eat your second meal until dinner time (or at all).  The food was delicious and the service was very quick despite being busy.  I did not expect the restaurant to be as big as it was from the store front.
/user_details?userid=nCSqhXSQBqOx5pJOchRjEg,Denise R.,"Bronx, NY",5 star rating,Ok ok so this place...absolutely delicious! The food was awesome.  Drinks selection was good. Place was bright and nicely decorated. It's a must go in Montreal!

/user_details?userid=5WI21p-ID0Vf9siLBoDx6w,Steve C.,"Quakertown, PA",5 star rating,Great breakfast. The DiCapra Eggs Benedict were very good (per my wife) and I had their signature crepe omelet which I couldn't finish and had to take to go. The fresh squeezed orange juice was very good. Give it a try!

/user_details?userid=qsfFBvdJ66cbv7zuOD7xbg,Danielle P.,"Roslyn, NY",4 star rating,"Clean, modern decor, food is plentiful, well presented and quite good ( ask for the real maple syrup which costs a fraction more) but the customer service is a little unfriendly. Not sure whether because we couldn't converse in French( which seems to be the local pet peeve here) Nevertheless we shall return!"

/user_details?userid=Xgc8RAII67FdKk9Iwv62rg,Matteo C.,"Gansevoort, NY",5 star rating,"Great food, large portions, and friendly service for an affordable price. No sacrifice between quality and quantity because you get both. Went on a Sunday morning at around 09:00, there was no wait. Staff was friendly and prompt, well versed in both English and French. We ordered an oreo-ice cream waffle, breakfast poutine with hollandaise sauce, and cappuccinos for some affordable post-traveling comfort food -- all of which was delicious. Only critique was the waffle was not warm when brought to the table, which is important to contrast the ice cream temperature; however, it did not detract from the overall quality of my experience and I would definitely return."

/user_details?userid=CoEb1P8GdB72yjbT6cJuBQ,Meg S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Visited during the afternoon. Wasn't too busy. My server was very nice. I got an omelette (spinach & cheese). So good and filling. The omelette was larger than i expected. It came with potatoes, which were very good and well seasoned. I also ordered a fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, delicious. Definitely a recommendation."
/user_details?userid=qj6ky-KYY2JJt90lg4vTlQ,Bitter F.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,Over priced greasy spoon kinda spot with portions large enough to feed 4 people.  Not for me and would not recommend to others.
/user_details?userid=PrBrStKVl9qRhZdg9cN8dQ,Guilherme C.,"South Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,Extremely disappointing restaurant. Food is bland and they value quantity over quality. Service was very bad even though the place was only half full and had tons of waiters around. I would not come back or recommend it to anyone. Had no problems with cleanliness but the rest let me down so bad that one star is all I can give.
/user_details?userid=zW8URvHx4-NCl1QzE0ZzMg,John G.,"Columbus, NJ",5 star rating,My favorite breakfast place anywhere.  Great crepes. Fresh fruit. Good coffee.  Best breakfast place.

/user_details?userid=AyBePF0fwSwpyBSmj9wErg,Franchy H.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Excellent restaurant overall. Interior decor is very nice, spacious and clean. Very friendly staff and attentive. Large menu with many great choices to choose from which makes it hard to actually pick something! But rather that than a junk menu. Highly recommended and would return myself when in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=YxBL4YDq4SMvNbB-GffYuw,Jennifer S.,"Cranford, NJ",3 star rating,"I would compare Allô to IHOP. The food was fantastic, there were many options, and the portions were large. However, the service pretty much sucked and we spent about 2.5 hours at this place due to waiting for our waitress to acknowledge us. I would go back again because of the food but we really felt like they forgot about us for 95% of the visit."
/user_details?userid=I0eFTAx4PU-bLPQ3xccCug,Jens W.,"Slangerup, Denmark",4 star rating,Only 3 month old at this location. Nice setting and a great menu selection. Potatoes was really good!! The fruit plate is huge!!! Great food but US size portions
/user_details?userid=bGbr0SVYXTO6eHfnqoT0Hw,Rebecca S.,"Memphis, TN",3 star rating,"Stopped in here to eat shortly after arriving in Montreal. We were exhausted from travel and hungry, and Allo Mon Coco was the first place we saw near our AirBNB. It was late in the afternoon and the restaurant was otherwise empty, so it took the hostess several minutes to notice us. The breakfast/brunch food was good, but not exceptional. The crepe was the best part of my meal, and please note that ordering cheese on your potatoes will get you A LOT of cheese! The eggs were cooked just right. The portion sizes should not be underestimated! Out leftovers were dinner that night."
/user_details?userid=tZGvhhYxGa718fkMu0rayQ,Joey S.,"Timmins, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food with very friendly, and courteous service. If you don't speak French fluently, don't try, even if you think you're doing the server a favour. I ordered what I believed was 2 eggs, bacon and a crepe. What I got was 2 pancakes French toast and a fruit bowl. After bringing my ""wrong order"" to the waitress, she politely pointed out my mistake, I acknowledged and apologized, and she still brought me an egg and two slices of bacon free of charge. Lesson here: it's a tourist town and the service staff is well trained to take your order in English, understanding it much better than you probably understand French. My buddy ordered a fruit plate (in English) and she asked him again if he wanted that fruit plate to make sure that she heard him say ""fruit plate"". It wasn't any kind of language barrier. This is because the fruit plate stands as tall as a small child with almost every fruit you find at a grocery store. It looked like a fruit top hat. Eating it was an experience he described as an adventure. Overall, the food was very good atmosphere was nice and the service was quick. I never got a refill on my coffee, but you can't win em all. I say take a chance on this place."
/user_details?userid=aT6xRx6ghVpyrqjzVmNvFQ,Morag K.,"Calgary, Canada",1 star rating,"Not impressed. Neither of our eggs were cooked the way we asked. Food wasn't very hot. Server took my tea to warm up, never came back with it.  Would not recommend this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=Y3j14l1TjXJ6a7eLRWJniw,Almut E.,"Kaiserslautern, Germany",5 star rating,"Amazing breakfast place. I went there every morning during my weeklong trip to Montreal. Potions are huge. Most days I hardly needed any lunch. My absolute favourite was the avocado benedict. Fruit salad is very good, too."
/user_details?userid=0LUjQvDVOrGJUvbzicKyoQ,Sasha C.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"This a Québéc-based breakfast/brunch chain spot with approximately 20 locations throughout the province. A great place if you're looking for a hearty meal after traveling! Lots of variety. Go here hungry- the portions are hearty. I ordered the Mortabello grilled cheese- it was served with a lovely cup of fresh fruit and 'breakfast potatoes' which are served in such a way that Americans would call them ""smashed potatoes"". I'm giving this place 4 stars because the potatoes were a tad cold, which was disappointing and the service wasn't spectacular- We had to ask for more coffee and water a few times even though the place wasn't busy at all. Despite this, the waitress seemed stressed or distracted and mostly hung out near the kitchen- I think they may have been shortstaffed or something -but this isn't the type of place where you go for the service anyway- the food and value you get speaks for itself."
