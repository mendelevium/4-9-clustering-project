/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here during a blizzard, hoping to get some good reasonably priced food. We were also quite hungry as well. They offer a ton of skewers on their menu so we just ordered a whole bunch of different appetizers and skewers:- Grilled Marinated Short Ribs- Truffle Karaage - Otto Chicken Set (6 Skewers) - Lamb Skewers- Grilled Pork Belly SkewersThe ribs were sweet and savoury, but were a bit on the dry side for me. Truffle karaage didn't have a strong truffle flavour. The batter was very crispy though! I found the addition of sweet potato balls to be odd for this dish, as it didn't really do much to accompany the karaage in terms of taste. The otto chicken set consisted of chicken wings, chicken thigh, chicken skin, white meat, chicken thigh with green onions, and chicken cartilage. The chicken skin was very delicious. As for the others, they tasted like regular chicken skewers, nothing special. They also offer lamb skewers, which were a bit tough for my liking. the pork belly skewers were juicy and yummy. I think overall, the food here is just alright. I probably would like to have seen a stronger taste profile on the yakitori skewers."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been looking forward to try out Yakitori cuisine! Yakitori is actually a Japanese type of skewered grilled chicken and its preparation involves skewering the meat with kushi (a type of skewer typically made of steel, bamboo, or something similar). At Otto, far more than grilled chicken is to be offered, depending on your taste palette.You can find bite-sized pieces of chicken thigh, breast or for the more daring of us.... skin, heart, neck, liver or gizzard. Overall, I enjoyed every type of kushi brochette offered (some more than others!). The Japanese style of seasoning was a great initial Yakitori culinary experience for me. I definitely would recommend the chicken skin, was by far my favorite!For newcomers do try their meat sets found on the menu to enjoy a variety of meats. Pricing is fair but do expect the kushi brochettes to be a little on the small side (tapas style). So the cost can add up if you plan to eat your fill. Along with the meal, I went with a Truffle Sour drink. It was good... and extra sour like I like it. :)Our host/waiter was super helpful and friendly. Cute little resto. The whole experience was super positive and this is a great little spot for a bite/drink in the area! I'll be back for sure."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is good. We tried several skewers and my fave one is definitely the chicken skin. It's so crispy and flavorful. All the skewers have a nice smokey charcoal taste. The rest of the food were good, but the burger's bun was too dry and not soft enough and the truffle karaage didn't realy have any truffle oil taste. The place is small so it's better to reserve, especially if you go on a weekend. We went on a monday and we had to wait a bit. The service is quick except for the squid which took a long time to be served. The staff is nice and friendly and they came to refill our water several times. Overall it's a great place to hang out with friends and grab a few bites."

Service was good  wasn't too big of a fan of the tofu salad, there was too much dressing made my salad taste too much like vinegar. Other than that, had the bimbimbap, kaarage, squid tentacles and the chicken thigh skewers were perfect. And to top off the night with a little soju."
/user_details?userid=JVHK7JItWX5nzy08HUtbhw,Luke L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,A rare gem of high quality affordable Japanese food in a city flooded with 7/11 style Japanese food. The place has achieved a masterful balance of Indy spirit and ethnic authenticity. Go get every variety of chicken skewer and try the chicken knee bone. Don't forget the rice balls - one of the best outside of Japan and not usually offered elsewhere. The chawanmushi is a must at every seating. You can't go wrong with any choice here.

Very good quality. I never really feel disappointed with the meat at Otto. It's pretty great each time I go. * The bimbimbap was overall tasty as well, a bit pricey for the amount you get. I do wish they gave more. The egg broke really well. Loved it!"
/user_details?userid=CaaGjAM1yL_t4yhNLD3f_g,Adele W.,"Pickering, Canada",4 star rating,"We came here for dinner when we were in Montreal for the Grand Prix. The restaurant is quite small with somewhat limited seating. I would suggest showing up so on after the open or make a reservation. We ordered the Japanese Curry and Bibimbap. Both dishes were fabulous and extremely flavourful. We also ordered a side of lamb skewers and one of the specials which was bacon wrapped asparagus. Both tasted fine however, the bacons wrapped asparagus was not worth the money. $10 for the two little skewers which maybe contained one asparagus spear and one strip of bacon each. An incredible markup. Overall, we had a great time here and really enjoyed our dinner. Service was quick and efficient."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I walked by Otto Yakitori Izakaya while we were in the 'hood. It peaked my interest so I did a little research before deciding to check them out for Friday night dinner. We were able to grab a table without reservations although the place was bumping. Service is friendly and super efficient; just like it is in Vancouver. The menu is mainly grilled skewers (it is a yakitori after all) but there's also some fried, hot steamed and finisher items. They also have a special menu. Hours are sick! Open till 1:00am most days and 2:00am Friday and Saturday. - Otto chicken set ($16.00 for 8 skewers) - you get chicken meat balls, thigh, heart, skin and wing. An assortment to sample and perfect way to share. You can really taste the wood charcoal they use to grill their skewers. - Otto veggie set (12.00 for 6 skewers) - you get tomatoes, brussels sprouts, mushroom, lotus and zucchini. Whatever the side dip is called is soooo good. Awesome zip to it. - Geso furai ($5.00) - squid tentacles were crispy and nicely seasoned with a hint of heat. - Buta burger ($6.00) - this was surprisingly good. The bun was incredibly fluffy with a great sauce and tasty pork belly. - Otto curry rice ($7.00) - chicken curry. Nice to have some carbs with our meal. - Sot-l'y-laisse kushi ($3.50) - off their special menu. Chicken oyster wrapped in chicken skin. This was M's favourite. Cool spot with great food and reasonable priced drinks. Should have tried their homemade ice cream! Open late and gotta say, I love this area. Chinatown 2 just keeps getting better and better."
/user_details?userid=Xgnkm6ryeHNtdIlpPJ5YqQ,Huyn N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here because of the recommendation on Yelp. First impression is that the place is nice with all the decorations. Me and my friend ordered one chickens skewers set which has meat ball, liver, skin, thigh, wing and one more thing but I'm not sure what it is. Add to that, we tried one beef tongue skewer, a bibimbap and midori cocktail. The chicken set was fine, the chicken thigh was good but the others not really stand out. The beef tongue doesn't have any seasoning and yes of course it's chewy, so 5,5$++ for one beef tongue skewer not really worthy. The egg in the bibimbap has good looking, the seasoning is good but a little too oily. Maybe it's a japanese version so they add some stir fried onions to the spicy pork. Finally, for the cocktail, maybe it's the tastiest thing. It's creamy and refreshing at the same time. Totally, it's fine but not really worth it for 60$."

It is a bar restaurant so the music and the environment is a bit loud, it is really up to the customer's preference.The squid taste soft and good, whereas the burger is a bit disappointing, because it looked a lot better and bigger on the menu photo. The only thing that taste yummy is the wasabi sauce, otherwise the other ingredients are ordinary.I'll recommend this restaurant more for the BBQ grill"

I checked out the restaurant thru yelp, and I was excited to try this place since then. What a cute spot! Decor is colorful. Love their menu too. My friend ordered the food, so we can share them as Tapas. From grilled vegetables, to grilled meats, to fried chicken with truffle, to bibimbap and to roasted ice cream; everything single item was A1! The flavors were magnificent! The music in the background was superb, from Abba, Michael Jackson to reggae music. In my head, I felt I was on my feet dancing throughout the evening. Lovely place to try!"

I've been here twice in the evening and have never been disappointed. Good: It is a really cozy and dim environment, I've showed up both times without reservations and got seated right away. The service was quick, and dishes came out pretty fast too. The prices are very reasonable, I usually get the bibimbap here because it's my favorite in the city. Yakitori dishes were solid, 10/10 will order again.Bad: None.Bottom line: It's probably one of the better places to eat in the Concordia area, I'm usually not a fan of the restos in this vicinity, but I will make an exception for Otto!"

My top chicken parts were1. Gizzard 2. Heart4. Oyster (limited* chicken oyster is behind the thigh) 5. Liver6. Skin The skin was completely fried, not what we anticipated. We thought it would be grilled.All the skewers were particularly salty which forced us to order beer. If you want to try something rich and full of chicken flavor, I recommend to order the chicken soup on a cold day."

Also strange that they are a japanese restaurant and serve that. It was also more expensive than other korean places.The jap burger was dissapointing. The sauces were to empowering the flavors of all the other ingredients.Took the set of chicken skewers,they were okay, missing some kick to them and missing a bit of flavors. The chicken balls were totally dissapointing and nothing like the ones i ate in japan.they were Dry and small.This place is okay if you are really craving some skewers.its one of the only places in mtl that offers it."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Went for lunch. Pretty solid yakitori. My favourites: chicken tail and skins. Very good. The thighs (w and w/o scallions) are also enjoyable. Not a big fan of the meatball and pork belly. Veggies were ok.The dinner menu looks far more extensive. Will try someday.

This place was the only one still opened until 1am.It was kind of hard to find because it had a small sign and it was upstairs in a house ... anyways we entered and they had very small seating areas. We sat in the corner near the back bathroom area. We looked at the menu , and it had french, english, and Japanese which is cool.We started off with the grill chicken salad,Then the beef short ribs, and then the deep fried chicken on a bed of salad.The beef short ribs was the best among the others. We end up finishing all the plates because it was a small amount of them, due to this establishment being kinda like... drinking accompanying foods... anyways the chicken was mediocre, the beef short ribs is a 4/5. But im giving this an overall 3/5 due to the loud obnoxious table next to us keep staring and screaming loudly. No manners at all. Its too late to be that awake and loud. They need to go home lol"
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,First time try this resto. Skewers were so small that doesn't impress me at all. Gamjatang is salty and broth is fat. Tofu appertizer is plain and has no taste. The menu of resto has very limited choice compared to other isakaya resto. Food are not typical of Japan.
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went there for a light dinner with my colleagues last week. One of us was not too big on meat, so we were hoping for some good vegetarian options. We arrived about 30 min after opening time, and the place was not very busy (only two other tables were occupied). The interior was very charming, with richly-coloured walls and cute wooden tables. The lighting was dim, so we picked the table with the brightest lamp. We each ordered an entree - three of us ordered the Otto salad, while I got the homemade tofu. We decided to share one set of 6 chicken skewers and one set of 6 vegetarian skewers. In addition, we ordered two chicken oysters skewers just to try. The food came fairly fast, and the skewers were absolutly delicious!! The vegetarian ones, which comprised of fried tofu, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, brussel sprouts (x2) and mushrooms, were especially good - it was like an ode to the Maillard reaction! The chicken ones were also very nice. It was great to see the use of different parts of the bird, instead of sticking to the same old legs, thighs, wings and breasts. The oysters (which are a well kept secret of the chicken anatomy) were plump and tender, and wrapped in a flavourful layer of chicken skin (which could have been grilled a bit more to let some oil out). Unfortunately, the homemade tofu was a bit of a let down. The texture was very grainy, despite the silky appearance. A finer mesh should probably be used during its fabrication.Note: Service was fast, but a bit simple. Questions about dishes were unsatisfactorily answered, and the four of us had to share two menus. Pricing was ok, but can probably go up very fast if ordering is enthusiastic."

They have potential and room to become much better. Hopefully I'll see the improvement next time I come :)."

Very small/cozy place. Food was excellent, especially appreciated how they had a variety of chicken parts, though no chicken tail sadly. Prices are fair for dt Montreal,  and considering the quality. Seasoning was very good and there was a nice smoky char from the grill. Water was refilled adequately. Truffle kaarage and sweet potato: very good, chicken was excellent, crisp, moist, and with a tangy, almost citrusy drizzle, potato balls was crispy on the outside with a fluffy interior.Pork belly: well seasoned. Tasty but had slightly texture since it cooled down before I got a chance to eat itGizzard: very tasty but slightly too tough, but very good flavor and unique textureMeatball: meh. Weird sponge textureChicken wing: very yummy! Chicken wings are hard to screw up Chicken and leek: leeks slightly over charred, but good caramelized flavors and tender textureLamb: very heavy cumin flavor. A bit less might be better but was still tender and quite goodChicken breast: dry. Didn't likeChicken thigh: good. Hard to mess up.Vegetarian platter looked pretty good, nice variety. Waitstaff was not very professional, making a grimace of exasperation when we asked before ordering to split checks. She also stated that tips were included (4 of us heard this), but denied this when later asked while paying.Our food came at different times and it was awkward waiting to start eating as our skewers were cold by the time others had gotten their order. Also, their wifi was nonfunctional this night, so no music, and worse, cash only payment...at least they had an atm thank goodness."

If this is your first time you should try the Otto Bibimbap. That was my way I was introduced to this place and I loved it. The atmosphere is nice and if you add a Saporo Beer it improves. The servings are bountiful, so don't order too much. The other time I had the Buta Burgers and they were delightful. These were not as abundant as the Bibimpbap, so you can always ask for something else, or have it if you simply want a medium sized"

/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A small cozy Japanese resto bar. It's usually quite busy, especially on weekend evenings, so a reservation is ideal! The menu is simple, and focuses more on meat dishes. We started off with some chicken karaage and some tsukune skewers (jap meatball). The karaage was fried and seasoned to perfection, being crispy on the outside and very juicy in the inside. We then tried their bibimbap and the chicken curry. The bibimbap was very delicious, which comes with flavourful minced pork and sauce, while their curry was simply okay, nothing amazing. I would have loved the curry more if it came with fried chicken instead. As for drinks, their sake mojito was very refreshing as well as their yuzu fizz! Overall, the food is simple and tasty with decent prices, which makes this a nice cozy spot to go for some drinks and quick bites with friends."

/user_details?userid=QfPPX7EjxWJJCcpKT5Qv1g,Ben K.,"Phoenix, AZ",5 star rating,"This place was really cool. I have never eaten anything like this. You basically select a cut of meat and it comes out on a kabob. We had lamb, duck, chicken thigh, and pork belly. They were all delicious with my favorite being the lamb. It was seasoned really well. The portion sizes were a bit small, so if you're starving this prolly is not a good idea but it was a great experience. We also had edamame and Brussels sprouts which were good. The place was packed to the wall as so we had to wait a bit for a table and food but that was not a problem and we were not in a rush."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As far as yakitori goes, I think this place has nailed it. There are a wide selection of chicken skewers available, as well as vegetables, and some other grilled items. We got 2 chicken skewer platters with gizzards, one vegetable plate, 2 grilled squids and 1 pork belly bun (which we shared). I also had their sake mojito which was an absolute perfect cocktail for my tastes. There are quieter times to dine there or more lively ones, I hear it gets quite busy as the night goes on. I can imagine it gets packed in there since it's a small space, but when we ate there on a Monday it was just starting to fill up so I found the atmosphere comfortable."

Skewers are well-seasoned.Staffs are super friendly and attentive. The restaurant however is very small and packed. We were a group of 12 people and they had to add a small table on the side for us. If you are having an event, it will be better to reserve in advance. Their bathroom is also very small u might be careful to not stumble when you turn. We have spent around 30$ ( taxes and tips included) per person. If you don't order drinks 20$ might be enough. Since the restaurant is an Izakaya(Janpanese often go to Izakaya to have a drink with friends and coworkers after work), the portions are not big, so you might want to order some rice to feel full filling."

/user_details?userid=n73Qtb87fvLhiMzTK9ppxw,Felicia M.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I liked it. Came here fairly early on a Monday night. Attentive service and good, solid food.Ordered the chicken set, grilled onigiri, beef tongue, nankotsu (chicken cartilage), bibimbab, sake.Bibimbab doesn't taste traditionally Korean but very savory and spicy, which I love. The chicken balls and thighs were too soft but I liked the rest of the chicken set, which gives good chewy texture. Most of the things were on the salty side.Overall, I like Otto. Good ambience and solid food. Can be pricey if you're a big eater but if you supplement the skewers with carby items like the onigiri and the rice bowls you should be okay."
/user_details?userid=dmprdDTSUebCPeTBGFxu5Q,Patrick E.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,"This is a small, lively Japanese restaurant that is open late. Service was fast and polite. The Karaage were just mini, boneless chicken fillets made with dark meat.  It tasted okay and the garlic mayo that accompanied it was average.  Chicken salad tasted okay but it did not taste Asian-inspired.  It was just an ordinary salad with decent dressing. The star of this place is their Karuba. The beef short ribs had a nice char to it and barely had any fat on it. Only complaint was that the size was small for the price charged. The bathroom was small and the toilet is so close to the wall that it is tough to sit properly down on it. This place is great for a late night dinner when options are limited."

I also need to point out, normally, it seems that is it loud and rowdy, which really doesn't bother me because I enjoy the ambiance, but for Mother's day (7h30PM), we were lucky that it was quieter.We ordered: 2x chicken skin (sounds weird, but sooooo crispy and delicious!)                    2x Chicken heart (don't knock it till you try it, nice bouncy texture with nice flavour)                    2x chicken gizzards (very similar to the hearts, just a little tougher)                   1x lamb (personally, it was ok. too much cumin for my taste)                   1x beef tongue (cooked med-rare and so delicious and beefy)                   1x chicken liver (cooked med-rare and was soft and gamey)                  - the fried squid is a MUST, best fried squid I've ever had!                  - marinated beef ribs, I recommend this because it was so soft and tender!                  - Japanese curry, I LOVE curry and this was so nice and tangy. Very different to Indian and Thai curries! This ones very homey and comforting.                 - 2x Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) BEST fried chicken! so juicy it dripped when you took a bite! and the chicken was nicely seasoned.Everything was delicious! Service was great! the 2 waiters that were there that night were super friendly. I don't think people understand how much of a HUGE difference it makes when you smile and just have a good vibe. It makes it SUCH an enjoyable dining experience.We left with the ""after restaurant glow"" which happens when there was good food, good company, good service and a good time!Would come back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"For a spot specialized in yakitori I expected much more compelling grilled meat. At 2-3$ a pop, each skewer features a tiny amount of meat in some depressingly generic soy based seasoning. The chicken brown meat was good but let's be honest, even the worst cooks can't screw that up. On top of that: clunky service, mushy rice, incredibly hard to chew beef tongue and dry lamb meat.I was tempted to try many more menu items with a second order round but after realizing the first 30$ spent gave us no satisfaction we decided to bounce."
/user_details?userid=hFvLG_m26hYMx1UGQSpaEg,Jo N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Visited this restaurant for a late night snack. The servers were extremely friendly and was very detailed in explaining and recommending us dishes.We ordered a platter of chicken yakitori. We paid an additional $2 to opt for no organs. All the skewers were absolutely delicious. The only complaint we have is that the skewers need a little more salt.  We weren't really a fan of the seasoning that came with it on the side because it was a little too spicy for us. So, if it was a bit saltier, it would've been perfect, then the skewers wouldn't require additional seasoning. The pork belly was pretty good too. As for the mushrooms, I feel like it was a little pricey for the portion... not that worth it.Also tried the scallops, they were pretty fresh. Additionally, we ordered the beef tartare. This was delicious, it was the weekly special. If this is ever on the menu, you must order it! They are very generous with the portions and I love how they pair the tartare with beet chips. It's was really delicious, nice combination!As for drinks, we ordered the matcha calpico. This drink was pretty unique. Never had this combination before, worth a try!Overall, love that it's open late, definitely recommended in visiting if it's late and you're hungry or if you're looking for a place to chill with friends. They serve beer and other alcoholic drinks!"

Cute room, not too big or too small, not too fancy but cosy and kind of romantic even, small corners where you could chill and have a quiet conversation. The welcome and the service was friendly and helpful throughout. The food was tasty, but there were a couple things they could do that would really improve the menu and the dining experience in general in my opinion. For one, it was hard to find anything on the menu that was vegetarian, like proper no chicken no fish vegetarian. I'm not a full veg but I really prefer to eat mostly vegetables and have been finding it easier and easier to find delicious vegetable dishes made by our great local chefs. But not here, or at least not when I went. No vegetable dishes, very meat heavy menu. Meat skewers were the specialty, and they were tasty but it was just too much for me. The house smoked salmon rice bowl with roe was tasty but it was covered with a mountain of roe, way too much salty roe adding to the overall saltiness of the meal. Anyway, like I said, there was lots to like so I'd definitely try it again if folks were going there but I wouldn't head there on my own impetus."

We waited at the door for 10 minutes trying to get the attention of the 3 waitresses working there. Two of them made eye contact and noticed the lineup but just ignored it and went back to running around. One of the waitresses even went through the lineup to serve food to the terrace but did not pay attention or ask try to seat the waiting customers. I do understand that we arrived at a busy time but the least someone can do is to address new customers. Once we were seated we were asked to move to another table to accommodate a bigger group of 6 which seem to know one of the waitress.The place is fairly small (about 14 tables + terrace) and there were 3 waitresses working. Overall it doesn't seem like there's any organization on how the service is done. Most of the time they're all running left and right without really making the service more efficient.Price: ~15$ - About 2$ per skewers and below 10$ for the main dishes."
/user_details?userid=Zxm9YdQPtkLl4RZrIL9eTA,Chelsea T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We came here Sunday night for a birthday dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the chef's choice plate: 10 different skewers, ranging from chicken wings to chicken liver. These were all delicious and well cooked. We also ordered the deep fried squid, which was by far, my favourite dish of the night. The squid was well cooked, the batter was nice and airy, and the flavor was spot on. The service was also friendly and efficient. The prices are very decent: 200$ for 6 people, including a pitcher of beer and 3 sakes. Everyone left satisfied. We really enjoyed our experience, however, a few things make it a 4 star, rather than 5:- the porkbelly was disappointing. It was chewy and bland- the Otto salad was good, but there was just too much dressing. I couldn't taste the egg or fish in itOverall, it's a good restaurant, especially if you stick to the skewers."
