/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It literally just opened today  so I understand that they are still trying to find their feet.Taking up residence at the building that housed the last free-standing Dunkin'Donuts in Quebec , on Wellington Ave. In Verdun, the newest resident to take this place is Jack Le Coq, a newish Québécois try at fast-food fried chicken. Verdun used to have a Kentucky Fried Chicken a few years ago until they closed. There are a few Korean fried chicken outfits in the neighbourhood like Comon (which is excellent) , Moa Moa(haven't tried it yet) so I guess there is space for Québécois-styled fried chicken in Verdun . Not Southern, not Nashville, not Kentucky, not Korean, this fried chicken was just sort of underwhelming . I found that there was too much fat still left underneath the crispy skin layer for my liking. Maybe others like it but I'm not a fan. The side dish of Mac'n Cheese could have come straight out of the Kraft box if I didn't know any better. The round puffy chip fries were very good though. If you have hot sauce at home, then you're set with the chips.They have other stuff on their menu like chicken tenders, meal boxes, family meals, a whole slew of fried chicken sandwiches, poutine and even a soft ice-cream bar which I can see becoming popular in the summer.I don't see myself becoming a regular here but at least there's more options now in Verdun.They also offer home delivery and take-out."
