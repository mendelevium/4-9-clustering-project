I visited last Sunday for brunch and thankfully, the food was tasty, the ambiance and vibes were great, and the service was good too.I ordered the Ackee and Salted Fish with Bakes (fried sweet dough) and Plantain. In my humble opinion, the Bakes were definitely the highlight of this meal; they were fried to perfection - golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Also, the salty fish and the sweet Bakes complimented each other well; the sweet/salty balance was much appreciated. Not only were the flavors spot on, but the portions were huge. This dish could easily be shared between 2.I found this restaurant to be very affordable. For the price, you definitely get your money's worth. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I hope to return to try some of the other items on the menu."

I went to Local Legend on a Sunday around 11:30 for a brunch with friends, one of them was celebrating her birthday. The interior is cool, there are green plants on the ceiling and some touches of kitsch decor such as a pale pink sofa and arcade games.The brunch menu is quite simple with a Caribbean twist. Prices range from $ 17 to $ 12. I ordered the Brioche French Toast and fried shrimps ($ 17) with a mimosa ($ 8). The dish arrived with breaded chicken instead of what was mentioned on the menu, but they changed it quickly upon request. The french toast was a little too sweet for my taste but others might appreciate it, the chicken and shrimp were good not too dry, the breading was tasty.They were kind enough to keep my friend's birthday cake in the fridge and brought it back for us with candles and a kind happy birthday song. Overall the service was good. I will probably be back shortly to try other items on the menu."

We also had some appetizers that were super delicious. Place is clean and modern with a nice ambience. Was in the city for four days and went here twice. Highly recommend!!

Welp, the food was all very flavorless.  The service was absolutely non existent and it seemed as if nobody knew was occurring. We waited for our bill for quite some time and none of the servers even remembered what we had.  It was quite a disappointment for our first meal in Montreal."
