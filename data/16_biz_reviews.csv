I have been meaning to go there for almost a year but it never happened until today. I along with 2 other friends went over at Yokato Yokabai and as soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted by loud ""irasshaimase"" and then had the best treat of we could get on a rainy winter day! We tried the ramen with gomami broth and chicken. The broth was simply unbelievable. All of us just loved it and were like ""ah we wish we had more broth ..."" The noodles was also great! Having lived in Japan for almost 6 years, I can vouch that outside of Japan, it would be pretty hard to find better ramen than this place. The decor, the ambience of the restaurant altogether makes it a perfect Japanese place! I would definitely go back to this ramen place with more friends :) Gotta try the other stuffs in the menu!"

The meat was perfect and the egg was really good with the broth. The noodles were also amazing, they stuck together a tiny bit so stir before you enjoy! Love that they have an option for extra seaweed and corn. Also got the karaage chicken entree to share and they were delicious."
/user_details?userid=Y9OQzttigHxtqtEbdFLTCA,Lindsay L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely a go-to for Ramen in Montreal! The entrance is a little hidden and off the main road, but that of itself kinda added to the ambiance of the restaurant. That being said, even arriving for a late dinner ~8 PM, there was a fair lineup and the entrance was packed of people trying to escape the cold and wait for their table. Luckily, you do have the opportunity to go through the menu and make your selections for broth/noodles/extras so the moment you're seated, your order is placed!I had opted for less salty tonkatsu broth, thick noodles, and extra pork. Given all the extras on top of the base cost, my order came to ~$13.50, which I thought was well worth the size and quality of the ingredients - just look at the thick cut of chasiu! I thought all the extra toppings definitely completed the bowl, but I think it would be nice if the standard variation had some of the staples like bamboo shoots and scallions. As well, each table had an assortment of extra seasoning to add in; my personal favourite was a chili garlic powder that I thought added a nice kick to a well-balanced broth (even as less salty). Overall, super solid ramen place with really speedy service! From the time. However, I do advise that wait times can be a little longer as its a small restaurant, and if you're going as a party of less than three you will likely be seated with strangers at tables, but turnover is very quick! Worth for a warm bowl of ramen during cold Montreal winters."

I would recommend it, the decor is nice, the food really good and the prices very reasonable! One tiny note on the fried chicken, it was a bit too deep fried for my taste but the taste was good."
/user_details?userid=LqywrHdM-H8gSdKtGrhBuw,Andre J.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"My go to place for ramen in Montreal. Easily the best spot in town, and closest to Japanese taste. Broth is rich and creamy, a bit on the heavy side, but really flavourful.Service is excellent, all waiters and employees are nice.Recommended :Tonkotsu ramen (with my picks of lotus seed, full egg and a must have seaweed), Gobo fries and Karaage."
/user_details?userid=ztS4OPmYcZ5QN952MxgfBQ,Emily L.,"Malden, MA",2 star rating,"Visiting Montreal from Boston I had really low expectations for ramen. Yokato Yokabai really didn't hit the mark for me. Food: I got the tonkatsu with pork belly, corn, scallion, egg, spicy kara-miso. It was mediocre, lacked flavor. The broth should've been steaming hot, but it was close to lukewarm as if it was sitting for awhile and that's not okay to me. Price: I don't think the price is worth it for the quality of the food. First off if I want to make the ramen spicier why do I have to pay a extra $1. The starting price is $14.95 and extra add ons just didn't make the ramen worth the price. Service/Atmosphere: The service was mediocre and because we were sitting at the bar because there was no room it felt like we were neglected. They were also really specific about the amount of people in the party and sitting at specific tables. If you have three people you need to be sat in a 4 person booth even though you could fit in a 3 person booth. Also there's not a waiting area so be aware as you might have to wait outside of the building.Overall: I will not be coming back, it's just not worth it. It really put me off from trying other ramen shops in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=cNYGGU79oQtR_xBSz6ZbvA,Ajara B.,"Sandy Hill, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"We went there because it had really good reviews and it was popular on Yelp. I personally expected more but the broth was too thick and oily. In addition, the noodles were hard in the middle and felt like they were a bit uncooked. Overall, place is ok but there are better places out there.."
/user_details?userid=QHy3WKG8XeWj2JJ7Adb1zA,Celine H.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"When it first opened a few years ago, it was similar to Ippudo! Now it's still good however we found that it was more expensive than before. I.e. adding 1$ for thick noodles and extra options. Preferred the tonkatsu soup base than the other option. However, place has expanded and they work jointly with Ichi Ichigo bar so we had a place quickly for big group."

From the outside it looked like the building was completely closed down, but it was actually spacious and really cute inside! The lunch menu is quite simple. You select what you want for your ramen from a small paper. I tried the pork in the traditional broth. It was absolutely delicious!!! I would have it again any day! I also tried the fried chicken as an appetizer and it was good. I would stick to ramen though. I highly recommend to try this place!!"
/user_details?userid=gRA-plF0LiZAE31BNQap_g,Tom P.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Probably the best ramen shop in Montreal?Chicken karaage: doesn't need any Japanese mayo as it comes with its own sauce and white and black sesame seeds sprinkled on top.Gobo (burdock) fries: at first I thought it tasted like fried eggplant fries, but it's actually a Japanese root. Tastes ok, wouldn't order again.Sapporo Draft: fresh, crisp, cold, goes well with hot ramen.Ramen: ordered thin noodles tonkotsu soup ramen. The ramen was delicious. This is the only ramen shop I've seen offer chicken teriyaki as a topping instead of chashu. It was meh. But a nice alternative if you don't like the fattiness of chashu. I finished the ramen in about 2 minutes. Portion sizes aren't huge so be sure to order an appetizer or two. Note: default only gives you half an egg, full egg costs extra (boo)"

/user_details?userid=JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,Amy Z.,"Newmarket, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is super dope. You have to look out for it or you'll walk right past just like I did. The service here is amazing and they get everything done very fast! There are tons of seating but apparently not enough as they still get people waiting at the door - I get it, a good ramen place in Montreal? That's kind of hard to come by?You can choose your broth, meat and toppings + any sides all written down on a piece of paper with your name - makes it super easy for them to give you your exact bowl and bill especially in a larger group. Love the organization here!I had the tonkatsu + pork belly with thicccc noodles and let me tell you - that was some good noodz. Even coming from Markham and Toronto where there's an aUtHeNtIc ramen shop every corner, this was up there on my list. The broth was creamy and the pork belly .... wow!!! I don't enjoy eating pork often but this place does it right. Super thick and TWO big pieces of pork, crispy edges and soft middle. Drool worthy just typing about it!The noodles had a great chewy texture as well. Everything was perfect about this meal except for the way it sat in my stomach after - being somebody who doesn't eat out often + doesn't eat a lot of oily/greasy foods, I immediately felt nauseous after devouring it and ran to the bathroom TWICE to wretch. :( I guess it had something to do with the creamy broth or the fatty content of the chashu. Do I regret eating the meal? HELLLL NAH! 10/10 would do again."
/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Definitely one of the best ramen places I've had the opportunity to try. Visiting in Montreal I tried to hunt down as many different cuisines as I could. I was very excited to find this place especially thanks to all the high reviews. Walking in, we were greeted fairly quickly and had our orders taken. They allowed us to customize our ramen with everything that we wanted. The food came after a short period of time and you can definitely tell that a lot of time and care was placed into making the dish. The broth was absolutely perfect, I asked for low salt and even with that you could really taste all the flavor. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender and the noodles were perfectly made as well. I was very satisfied with my ramen and I would definitely return here if I came to visit Montreal again!"
/user_details?userid=ZGTuCOVq7I4bsyypXAFcLw,Diana C.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Tonkotsu ramen was amazing. Broth was clear tasting and flavorful and not super salty. The noodles were thin but had a bite to it. The pork belly just melts in your mouth. The egg was soft boiled and slightly runny. A good bowl of ramen indeed. The place isn't huge and seating can be cramped. We were seated in the corner and with our big winter coats, it can be hard to fit ourselves in. There's usually a line out the door but we decided to skip the dinner line and opt to come back the next morning for lunch and the line was a lot shorter on Sunday noon compared to Saturday night. Servers were friendly but it was a bit hard to get service or anyone to pay attention to us. Maybe cause we were in the corner or maybe they were busy but we had to sit around for awhile before we can flag someone down. We ordered the yuzu ice cream because I think they make their ice cream in house. They had other flavors like sake too. The yuzu was a strong yuzu flavor and it was more of a sorbet than ice cream. It was a nice way to end our meal with something sour and refreshing."
/user_details?userid=JXfUPmN87P2TEpM3utgdqg,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Best ramen in Montreal! Very trendy spot that gets crowded really quickly, so come before peak hours! The thin noodles are excellent and if you like spicy definitely add in some spicy miso. The pork is so good here and a great addition. The portions for the Kara-age are also fairly good so it likely it isn't necessary to get a portion for each person."
/user_details?userid=4bP86EzvAa0sfaxrYW5_BA,Milena P.,"Buckingham, PA",5 star rating,"My first ramen experience and I believe I chose quite well. It was fantastic! So let me explain the lack of ramen in my life- simply put, I'm vegetarian and horribly allergic to food additives, preservatives, chemicals- so with that combo, you don't find many- or really any edible ramen broths anywhere! .Here not only do they promote natural healthy ingredients, there were two veggie options! The gomami was soy milk and sesame based- the other was kombu- natural msg- so of course I went with the gomami which was made to emulate tonkatsu pork broth which is their non- veg option. I can't begin to describe the rich soothing flavors that made the perfect base for home made ramen and accompanying vegetables. My boyfriend had the gomami broth with chicken and loved it every bit as much as I did. We also ordered the burdock fries and while they were interesting not amazing, they got my food allergies going quickly. Cravings for this place may make me come back to Montreal much sooner than I imagined!"

Yokato Yokabai is the closest flavour you'll get from Japan. Forget Kinton Ramen, THIS is your spot right here. Yokato will provide you a sheet where you can have your ramen custom made. From the level of salt to the thickness of your ramen- you got it the way you want it. Ichigo Ichie is an izakaya located right beside the ramen shop. Go there to grab a bite while waiting to get seated because Yokato does not accept reservation. Two birds one stone. You'll get two dinner in one seating."
/user_details?userid=_hsruQCw6UTnjlQiuSpScg,Mike M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,Best ramen I've had in Montreal... maybe in all of Canada.  I just came back from Tokyo earlier this year and I must say that this is very similar to the ramens I ate there.  The house beer on draft was also a perfect pairing.  Look no further if you're craving ramen in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Japanese cuisine (and culture) fascinates me greatly and when the opportunity came up to enjoy some ramen in a place like this I jumped on the offer. The place is small and you'll quickly want to take off your clothes as the place felt like a steam house. We opted to dine in Ichigo and try out a few of their menu items (also avoid all the heat!) but I wanted to specifically review the ramen I had.The menu options are simple, you get a paper and pencil and you order your ramen to your own discretion. Ramen here is hakata style. Hakata is a district in Fukuoka City, the biggest city on Kyushu and the style of ramen from there is universally recognized as the standard version of tonkotsu. Hakata Ramen is usually topped with chashu, egg, scallion, sesame seeds and pickled ginger. I didn't want to stray from the culture too much so my ramen soup was basically thick noodles, broth, chashu, scallions and egg. I garnished my soup with some seaweed (I'll get more next time!) and a few items provided at the table.The soup was fantastic. The broth was delicious and rich and made me more and more addicted as I tried to inhale my soup as slowly as possible. The seaweed was a perfect change of pace. The chashu (pork belly) was sublime and literally melted in the mouth. What a soup! Reading from reviews from people who had the real thing in Japan say it's very close to the real thing. This is a great compliment and I'm grateful to enjoy this soup on the other side of the planet. Service was great. We ate at the bar and our host was friendly. A few drinks were had, some were on the house.  The price/value for this kind of meal doesn't apply. I strongly recommend this place, I'll definitely be back.Gochisosama deshita!"

The taste is better than at other ramen place like Misoya, Kinton... Price with taxes and tips is high about 18$ since it is located on Plateau Mont Royal. My cousin took the vegetarien broth which seems to be normal."
/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",5 star rating,"This summer I was on a major ramen kick! After making several broths at home I wanted to compare mine to the pros. i completed the NYC trip I went up to Montreal to try out Yokato Yokabai which had a great reputation. I arrived wrote down my customized order and sat patiently like a little kid waiting for his ice cream bowl!! This place had a lot of hype to it and I was excited! The tonkotsu broth was my first venture into bliss. I added some spicy kara-miso, some bamboo, the obligatory egg, Nori, green onions, tried the 'thick noodles"" and the Cha-shu! Let me try to explain how freaking good this was! All you really need to do is look at the picture of the broth i took to understand. That being said, I can tell you that its was one of the creamiest broths I've had in a long time. The broth attached itself to the noodles in such a way that every slurp was pure heaven. Not overtly beefy or fatty, the Tare simply balance this bowl out to perfection. I do like spice and although they did not have any chili oil the spicy miso bomb was insane.. My obligatory egg was the perfect 5 min egg that coddled the noodles with yolk goodness! Their Cha-Shu was a bit different then i have seen in the past as it was meat forward and less fatty then most. This did not prove to be an issue as it simply melted in my mouth after one or two chews. The chewy thick noodles in my first round were exactly as advertised. When I got my kae-dama of thin noodles, for the end of my bowl, I was once again transported to ramen bliss. So it might not surprise some of you that a second bowl had to be ordered! I added some corn as the substitute to my egg and slurped away! Once I finished, complete satisfaction overcame me. Best bowl or ramen this summer. So there are three rooms, the bar room had booze and high top tables. the kitchen room has individual counters that are shared but no booze is served in this room and finally the third room is the evening service. Their broth is simmered for 12 hours and all ingredients are totally and certified organic. this place is very popular and does not take reservations so choose wisely when you go. Staff was friendly and helpful, food was very good, noise level moderate in the kitchen room and loud in the bar room.  I was there for lunch so i cannot speak about the downstairs room but with its high ceilings I'd say not an issue. I did find street parking but at night might be an issue.. Price point was a none issue as it was a superior meal! Run don't walk to Yokato Yokabai Ramen!!!"

/user_details?userid=yp0aBcdHbc9cVyrpENNSqQ,Fangfei L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I've had probably a dozen of the best ramen places in the U.S., but this shop still really stood out to me. My boyfriend and I came here when we were visiting Montreal since I was craving ramen and this definitely hit the spot. We both ordered the Tonkotsu ramen which, although wasn't the best I've had, was quite delicious. What really stood out to me though were their cocktails - the green tea and mango cocktails were amazing! Although it was a bit pricey for ramen, I would recommend this to anyone.Pros(+) Options on the menu: I really like it when ramen places give you options on the noodles, broth and toppings. (+) Cocktails: Already raved about these, I haven't really seen matcha cocktails anywhere else(+) It was easy to get seating for two when we went around lunch hour"
/user_details?userid=cxt5i-5eknjK525QRJWFXw,Siva R.,"Mountain View, CA",2 star rating,"I went to this place with a lot of expectations but I was hugely disappointed. I ordered Ramen with Gomami broth and Pork Belly meat. It looked good at first sight. However, it is not up to the mark when I tasted for the following reasons:1. The broth was at room temperature. I told the waiter and they brought me additional broth in a separate bowl, but that was over-salted. These people did not even bother to taste it before serving. 2. I was expecting pork-belly slices, instead, I got one that looked like minced meat. They probably mixed up the order.3. I had to pay $18 (little things add up quickly plus tax) and additional tip. For this price, I would expect better food and service.4. Service: They could use additional people. It looked like there is just one person taking care of everybody. Nobody even bothered to come in between and ask if everything was ok. It was all rushed and there was a huge line waiting outside. I am not sure why people are crazy about this place. Probably it was a one time miss."

Everything felt so authentique, you know the owners care about their art as everything had a nice presentation and excellent taste. Also had the karaage which I would definitely recommend to anyone trying as the chicken was crazy tender with a good crunchy crisp on the outside.

Because the Mtl ramen game isn't so strong, I'd say that this ramen joint is one of the best in town. Service was good, great ambiance, nothing out of the ordinary. The drinks were good too. There's always a line, and I won't go out of my way to eat here, but I highly recommend everyone to try. It really depends on personal taste."

After we ordered the place filled up very quickly and a line started to build, so you can tell this place is very popular. The order card was fun so you get to personalize your ramen. There was a good assortment of drinks and ramuné, which is a really fun Japanese soda (get the classic ""original"" or ""grape"")! I recommend going to the restroom while your there so you get to pass where they make their noodles downstairs!The matcha ice-cream was the perfect intensity of matcha flavor.

I opted for the Tonkotsu broth with extra pork belly and green onions and oh my was it delicious.  They have an assortment of condiments you can add (fried garlic, hot oil, pickled ginger and ground sesame) and all of it really helps enhance the already tasty flavor.  The broth itself was very rich and I could tell that they were simmering that pork broth for a LONG time by the flavor.  The place was bustling and even though we got there RIGHT at the openning (noon in this case on a Saturday), the interior was already packed (though there were seats in the back room).  Overall if you're in the area and are a lover of ramen definitely give this place a go!"

I remember a few times where the ramen was delicious; flavourful tonkotsu broth, amazing toppings you can add for free (sesame seeds, sesame oil, ginger and garlic chips) and even the smaller side dishes are tasty. I highly recommend getting their karaage, the topping they put on top of the fried chicken is unreal. Prices have stayed pretty consistent but I find it pretty expensive for ramen. It's about $15 if you keep all the basics without adding any extra. However, there are 2 extras I urge everyone to get: kara-miso (if you like spicy) and thick noodles. There's a catch since thick noodles are only available for lunch, which is so unfortunate. I had the regular noodles and they just don't taste as fresh. Lately, I find that the more I go, the more disappointed I get, which upsets me because I used to love it here. What's inconsistent here is the broth. Tonkotsu is pretty creamy in general which I appreciate, but some visits the broth is too thick and others it's perfect. I then did have one bad experience where the tonkotsu broth tasted too much like sea salt and it overpowered everything else. I also tried their yuzu ice cream and it's a must!Now, when Yokato Yokabai originally opened, you could only eat ramen on that side of the establishment. Now that it's a busier restaurant, they accommodate customers by opening a room on the Ichigo Ichie side as long as they did not reserve ahead, and that is a smart solution to the long lines, while still keeping the ""first come first serve"" basis. So in general, I believe everyone should come here at least once to try it out. I might be harsh because I've had amazing tonkotsu ramen here, but it just hasn't been the same lately. I still give Yokato Yokabai 4 stars because they do stand out from other ramen restaurants and they have unique perks. It kills me that I can't give 5 stars!"
/user_details?userid=N0evBQXJjifCDGfSSeLFCg,Ernest T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably some of the best ramen I've ever had. Yokato Yokabai is located on a corner but its entrance is pretty inconspicuous, but its food is quite the opposite and an absolute standout. It is definitely worth a visit whether you are a local looking for a ramen fix or a tourist trying out some of the amazing restaurants in Montreal.We started off with the Karaage (japanese fried chicken). It was crunchy, juicy and the chicken was very tender. It was topped off with some sort of green onion and shiitake relish-like condiment that added a slightly sour kick to it, which was interesting. Although the Karaage was great the ramen is (obviously) what this place is known for. All the ramen is made in-house and if you walk down to the washroom there is a wide window that allows you to look into the ramen-making room (and sometimes if you're lucky you'll see someone in there making the magic happen). And you can definitely taste the difference. I got the thin noodles and they were firm upon putting them in your mouth, yet soft on bite. It is hard to describe but they gave the perfect amount of resistance in your mouth. The tonkotsu broth, which you can adjust the salt level of, was pretty creamy and rich. It wasn't overpowered with salt or flavour and although pretty heavy from the dairy in it, it was relatively balanced. The chashu was by far the best I've ever had. It was extremely soft and tender and had a nice smokey flavour to it (and not overcooked, which is a common mistake). There was a perfect mix of fat and meat, and even the fat was very soft."

The place is small and cozy - You must arrive early if you don't want to wait!! I waited about 15 min for 2 persons on a saturday at around 6 pm.There is not really a menu. It's actually a small piece of paper where you choose what you want. The variety is very limited so don't expect a huge selection. You actually get the chance to customize you ramen (Vegetarien/Pork broth, large/thin noodle, etc.)So I took the chicken karaage as an appetizer and the tonkotsu ramen (with thin noodle, pork broth, cha-shu, scallion and half egg).Karaage- A little bit dry. (I think the chicken was made before we order)- Really crunchy which is nice.Tonkotsu Ramen- Noodle: It was excellent, it has a nice texture to it and it soaked really well the broth.- Broth: It's rich and creamy but the taste is just decent. - Chasu: Extremely good. It's so tender.Nothing to complain about the services!OverallDecent meal but with an incredible cha-shu! The broth deceived me the most. I might have expected too much!"

The soup itself is on the heavy/rich side compared to pho but gotta admit it has a good kick to it and the pork belly in this soup makes you smile inside. Had this ramen soup for the first time and picked this place because it literally shines with positive reviews and generous stars on the Internet. For $22 with tax and tip for a medium size bowl, I didn't see the value nor other incentive to come back. I'll stick with my pho. Beau, bon, pas chère as they say plus no line up to wait to get inside a small dark resto with no windows. Odd and a little sad IMO. Not for me but please go ahead and try to satisfy your curiosity if you're new to this. You might find out that you're more a ramen person than pho, who knows. As one of the two stars reviews put it and which I liked a lot: ""it's not you, it's me"" :))"

I walked around hoping the line would die down and at 8:30PM it was still a half hour wait!Yokato Yokabai has a very simple check off menu of 4 sides, 3 kinds of ramen, and 4 types of ice cream, with specials of ordering 3 items/$1.50 off and 4 items/$3 off. English on one side and French on the other.I got the tonkotsu (13.95) with kara miso (spicy) (1), pork, a whole egg (0.75), and corn (0.75). This is the only place I have found to have absolutely perfect slices of pork, thick, fatty, and meaty as well. The broth was milky and creamy, with all the fat and collagen emulsified into an amazing soup. The kara miso was a great addition adding color, flavor, and complexity to the broth, but I think the chili oil can suffice in that regards. The garlic oil is great for all those garlic lovers out there, including myself. There was pretty much meat in every bite! The thin noodles were perfect in this kind of heavy ramen and I think with Montreal's weather, does great to warm the belly and soul.Not the best at seating since there were about 4-6 seats throughout the 30 seat restaurant empty. Even by the time I left at 9:45PM there were still people waiting in line to get seated! Stools have a cubby underneath for your stuff but generally there is no place to hang your coat. Water is self serve on the tables and service is busy between two waiters (my corn was forgotten). Definitely checkout the bathroom art while you're there.Not sure about the alcohol vs non-alcohol section but based on other Yelpers apparently you have to sit at the bar to be served alcohol."

We live in Toronto and are lucky to have some of the best ramen in the world (Santouka, Sansotei, etc). In addition, we've visited Japan several times eating at the top ramen restaurants in the world. We can say with confidence that Yokato Yokabai is among the best.We ordered the tonkatsu with pork belly, regular salt, thin noodles. This is classic ramen at its best. You can tell from the intense depth of flavour that no corners have been cut in what is sure to be an insanely laboriously process. The pork belly is the one departure from tradition - and it works! Instead of the usual Cha Siu salty preparation, they opt for a more modernized caramelization. The result is a pork belly that melts in your mouth with a slight hint of sweetness. The broth is creamy but not heavy. FYI wait is long both for a seat and for your meal. Don't come in a rush. Highly recommend 10/10"

Every single aspect of their ramen is amazing. It is however a bit pricey in the sense that you're paying roughly about 20$ for a medium sized ramen. In theory it might seem a bit crazy, none the less their food is amazing. It's a place where you go to enjoy a Japanese classic from time to time and bring your closest friends. Like a precious secret.The atmosphere is very calming and relaxing even when it's packed on a Friday afternoon.

If so, you'd be seated in the bar section. The lunch menu was very simple with a handful of appetizers and two types of ramen, Tonkatsu and Kira-miso which you can choose to go with either chicken or pork. You can order from a piece of menu on the table and customize your ramen. We decided to get with the normal ramen which has regular saltiness. The broth was amazing. We also ordered gobo to go along with their fruit beer, Ichiko Ale.

Broth- At first I was worried that there was not a lot of broth, but after one sip I understood why. Their broth is twice as thick as most other places! The amount they give is just perfect, after finishing the entire bowl it is just enough too satiate, but not too much as to make you queasy with the heaviness. Could definitely taste the pork bone. Normal salt was very savory. Pork cha shui- melt in your mouth, perfect flavor. Egg- I cannot get over how good the egg is.  It has just the right amount of the slightly sweet flavor of Japanese soy sauce. I asked and they said it was marinated, first time I ever encountered a ramen place that puts so much thought into the egg!Noodles- only component that I would not give full marks on. I prefer noodles more chewy, and theirs, while not limp like many other ramen places, are not quite powerful enough. Would suggest adding a bit of salt to the dough and/or kneading it longer to perfect the noodles. Other condiments- seaweed was so good. Added bamboo which was also good. Chili oil on the table not super spicy, ended up adding about 5 spoons. Sake ice cream- first time ever having something like this! Super interesting flavor, but I felt it was a bit too icy and not creamy enough."
/user_details?userid=QgqFTenRkA8LJdCrZ4Gc8Q,Danny C.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"After a long night of watching of youtube of ramen houses in new york I just had a bad craving for a bowl of Tonkatsu ramen. The craving for Tonkatsu soup base, that's creamy and thick that coats inside your mouth when you drink the broth. Seeing the ramen noodles coated with the broth, the moment I slurp into my mouth is that warm feeling like being in bed with a warm blanket in a cold winter day.I went to a few Ramen houses in montreal and none of them were tummy warm satisfaction. Until I located this hidden ramen house on corner of Drolet and St-Denis called Yokato Yokabai. When I first passed by the Ramen house there wasn't a big sign but lots of great drawing on the front door. I arrive there on a snowy day afternoon lunch there was no line up. The moment I walked inside, was a warm feeling of smell in the air. They greet us in japanese and welcome us do we wanna have alcohol or not. Cause if you want to drink alcohol you have to go to Ichigo Ichie japanese pub connected to the Yokato Yokabai. No drinks for me.The interior was really traditional Japanese pub. Matches well with the menu. You gotta see the bathroom!! First you gotta find it in the basement.So I sat right next to the opened well ventilation open kitchen where the action is. I think I had the best seat in the house for person like me.You order your meal on a small piece of paper that offers Side dishes, main soups plus extra sides and Desserts. The waiter explain how to order very nice of him. I order a tonkatsu broth with chasu 13.95$ and whole egg 0.75$ more with extra green scallions.Side dish of fried crispy chicken ""Karaage"".The waiter put the order in, and I watch the chef start frying the golden chicken. In 6 mins the order comes to the table. It smells wonderful. I'm gonna wait for my Ramen to come first cause the karaage is still hot.The karaage looked really crispy. It was covered with grated radish and a ponzu sauce (I think). The first bite I took was a big crunch and juice of the chicken thighs pieces. Wow!! It's like eating a juicy chip in my mouth and proper seasoned. Very properly fried to perfection. Good work!! Other places only had little bit of crunch and no seasoning.After my first bite of karaage i was in another world, then the tonkatsu arrived. The presentation was very nice delightful and eye appetizing. The broth looks really creamy.It smelled very meaty like pork meat, pork cartilage and chicken-bones been boiling over the hot stove for 6 hours. The smell opened up my appetite like a hot apple pie out of the oven. Here comes the moment of truth, the taste factor. First thing gotta go for the the creamy broth. Big slurp from bowl to mouth. That creamy broth!! Is wonderfully coats inside my taste buds. I never had such creamy delicious tonkatsu broth in Montreal. It's gotta be that tablespoon of pork fat they put in the broth right before serving makes it so mouth pleasant. The broth coats well the noodle when you eat it the noodle it bounce or dances in the mouth. Very delicious. In the bowl of Ramen includes egg, onions, black fungus root (I think) and 2 thick slice of chasu with some fat on it. Let me liberate how they prepare the chasu, they boil the pork belly in the tonkatsu until tender. Then they take it out and cool down for several hours. Cut into thick slices before service. Right before serving they put the meat heaven in a toaster to warm it, after a few mins they take it out and BLOW TORCH they pork belly is until caramelize and bit of charcoal. That's what makes the pork taste so amazing!! You could see how passionate I am about a good bowl of Ramen.Alright back to the Bowl of Tonkatsu, the second element of heavenly. Is the egg!! The yolk is so perfectly cooked to medium. The yolk is liquidy but firm and it was marinated just enough flavour of the soya sauce. At the end I had a green tea ice cream and a SAKE ice cream. The green tea taste like any other, but the sake....wow!! It's a homemade sake ice cream it helped a lot to cut down the fatty broth. It's a really good match.At the end, I was a satisfied customer!! With a full stomach and a warm feeling after the meal. I highly suggest this place! On a rainy snowy day go out and grab a warm bowl of Ramen!!!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Presently the only ramen shop I'd recommend in Montreal. Not only it is authentic, it is gooood. Even my Japanese friend, a visiting scholar who describes himself as a ""ramen-freak"", approves of Yokato Yokabai.The menu is straightforward:  - choice of broth (pork or miso) - meat (chicken or pork) or vegeterian - toppings (green onion, seaweed, egg)Extras can be ordered, and saltiness can be tweaked - a nice accomodation for e.g. health conscious clients. Then there's sidedishes. We tried the fried chicken (karaage), the most popular, and found it great. The ramen, however, is on a whole other level. All the secrets are in the broth. Hakata-style ramen is renowned for its pork (tonkotsu)-based soup. It is thick, opaque, rich and delicious. Different jars of condiments are also available: fried garlic, sesame, picked ginger, etc.Speaking of options, I heard that Yokato Yokabai now offers cold (hiyashi) noodles! A great choice during summer to avoid sweating extra buckets.To cool down, there are also desserts. We had yuzu ice cream, the only item we disliked that evening. It was initially delicious, but yuzu was so potent that my tastebuds were cringing at the end. I'll definitely opt for green tea next time.Finally, to encourage all fans of ramen to visit this restaurant, I wrote a haiku:Delicious ramenFrom Yokato YokabaiSummer in a bowl"

We entered and were greeted with a question, "" do you only want ramen or do you want drinks?""  Both I said so they escorted us to next door to Ichiego.  I guess there might be a license issue.  But since we mainly had the ramen I'm putting this review here. We had both the tonkotsu and the spicy miso. Both were excellent. Very rich and yummy. If you are looking for lighter styles of ramen, probably not your place. But for rich porky goodness, then this is your place. Pork was flavorful, tender and rich.  The egg nicely done. You can customize a bit but I suggest going with normal and standards for your first time to check in comparison to your tastes. We also got some of the mackerel since we were on the izakya side.  Excellent but maybe a bit pricy.  But having some pickeled mackerel with kiwi and just barely torched turn out to be very tasty. Reasonable beers and interesting selection of saki. But prices on saki always depress me but what are you going to do about shipping and import issues?  Go now and enjoy!  I plan to go back before the end of my holiday."

This is a cute little spot tucked away in the plateau that I got the chance to try out on a Friday night. Definitely show up early because there seems to always be a line anytime I pass by. The staff was friendly and the restaurant is very cozy and cute inside. The menu is a little paper where you pick out the items you want in your ramen (choice of a few beverages, no alcohol and a few types of ice cream to choose from for dessert). The prices were fair, not dirt cheap but not overly pricey either I ordered the thick noodles, with pork belly, corn seaweed and egg. They brought me the thin noodles instead but I'll forgive it because the soup was so rich, delicious, comforting and full of flavour! I was definitely not disappointed. We also had the ice cream (my boyfriend had the matcha ice cream and I had the sake ice cream) both were great not too sweet and really interesting fun flavour in the sake ice cream it was my favourite between the two. I highly recommend this place to any Ramen fan - enjoy !"

Honestly I was really disappointed with their broth. I thought it was missing the ""kick"" so much so that I asked for crushed raw garlic (which they didn't have) and some salt. However, my companies did enjoy their bowl of ramen so maybe it's just a matter of preference.The chicken appetizer, though, was great. If I ever come here again, I'd order this dish and skip on the ramen bowl."

I chose the less salt but still got very thirsty after the meal. Since I was already very full with noodle and broth and appetizer, I couldn't quench my thirst with more water. Overall it is worth trying, the pork and egg is very special to my taste. The thick broth is not my favorite. There are four appetizers to choose from and we had three of them. The fried veggi roots is new to me. Very tender even after deep fried. The fried chicken and don(rice) are very good too.

Having been to Japan recently, I came back to Montreal with the hunt for a ramen that comes close to what I tasted in Japan. And this place is likely where it comes closest.Located in a reclused corner, there are only few seats. The ambiance was nice and you get to see the kitchen, just like in Japan. There are only few choices for your ramen bowl, but don't let that deter you, the taste is really flavorful. The broth is also very thick, which is positive. The only downside though is the high price. But for the quality you get, it is worth it!"

And I don't even like ramen like that. Well now I officially do ;) Thank you Yokato Yokabai!!The rest of my entourage all ordered the Kara-Miso Porc ($14), Chasu-Don ($5.50) and homemade Green Tea ice cream ($4).

There's always a lineup and we waited for 1 hour when we arrived there at 6PM. Reputed to be the best ramen place in Montreal, Yokato is one of the busiest Japanese restaurants I have ever seen in the city. The inside of the place is quite dim but has good vibes and their bar is less busy than the eatery. Their sake is nice and four of us shared a bottle.Their ramen, my god, is indeed worth the one hour wait. The soup is savoury and cooked for hours with pork bones. It's creamy and rich but not excessive. The handmade ramen noodles is chewy and heavenly. Pick reduced salt soup and the taste is just extremely well balanced, otherwise the regular salt level is a bit salty to my taste.An extra surprise was the homemade yuzu (Japeness citrus) sorbet, WOW WOW and WOW! Refreshing and balanced to perfection it is a Must try! I would go back just for the ice cream"

I always choose the less salty broth, as their tonkotsu is quite rich. It is very hearty and genuinely tasty. Their pork chashu is always great quality and well cooked (yum for meat lovers!).Because their tonkotsu soup is so rich and filling I would definitely wish that they provided some vinegar to cut the heaviness of the pork."

The soup was flavourful and fatty. Also took the gobo fries which was interesting,but a little bit overfried. the karage was not most,nor jucy,just a froed chicken and i have tasted better.The service was attentive,the waiting staff girls seems to be working super hard.It's also a good thing u just leave your name and they call u back when your table is ready.The service was a little bit confusing, i ordered extra noodles and karage,it only came at the end when i was almost done with my ramen.It is understandable though,busy saturday so i didn't go crazy about it.Bottom line,the place looks great and has a nice ambiance. the food is okay, i would say better than the ramens on st-cath.

I still waited roughly 10-15 mins. but noticed that couples or groups of 3+ were definitely waiting 25-40 mins. The menu is short and sweet. You've got some apps but the rest of the menu is for you to order your own customized ramen. You get to select the type of noods, amount of broth, salt level and choose your toppings. I kept my ramen order pretty basic and I got my meal within no time. Broth was perfect. I loved that it wasn't too salty and the noods were good too. Staff members were friendly.

The first two times I came to this place, I let them talk me into getting the pork broth with a bit of spicy kara-miso in it, and each time I was a bit disappointed. The broth was super tasty but I found it odd that it was so lukewarm instead of hot (maybe because of the miso paste), and I found the milky texture a bit off-putting. I could tell it wasn't bad, just not my thing, which bummed me out, because I've wanted a good ramen place for a while now. So, last time, I got the veggie broth with chicken, no kara-miso paste, and it was FANTASTIC, with just the kind of flavour profile I wanted, and a rich, clear broth served piping hot. Best ramen I've had in ages, maybe ever. The moral of the story: if this place doesn't grab you the first time, give it another shot and switch up your order. They're obviously very proud of their pork tonkotsu and spicy miso paste, but those aren't going to be to everyone's tastes. Besides, the prices are pretty good and the selection is quite small, so it's easy enough to experiment a little."

Food was just ok. Also not many food option for kids.. ordered fried chicken plus 2 ramens. Their broth was creamy but very heavy. Meat was well cooked, flavourful and tender but their broth was a bit bland (had better ramen with better toppings). We thought it was overpriced, total of 50$ for ramens and fried chicken.

Ended with their homemade ice cream.  We were a group of people so we tried all the flavors.  The green tea is by far the best one, followed by the yuzu, sake and then vanilla.  Great pricing too! appetizer, ramen with extras and ice cream for $24 before tip.  Reasonable dinner price for the amount of food you get.Staff was super efficient, friendly and professional.

There aren't many options for different types of broth, or toppings. I ordered the regular tonkotsu, with corn added. My choice of 1/2 egg, 1 piece of seaweed, onions, and 2 pieces of chasu was included in the base price.The broth was rich and creamy, it paired well with the texture of the thin noodles. The chasu was tender and cooked perfectly. Downsides were that the egg was subpar, and the portions were a bit small; but I left satisfied.It's worth checking out, but perhaps not worth waiting an hour in line- as other reviewers have described."

I always have tonkotsu wherever I go, and soup here is really creamy but somehow saltless even I ordered normal--really porky but feel something is missing. I didn't get much soup in bowl either.Other than that noodle is really fine which I liked it, I ordered extra bamboo shoot and lotus root and came with good amount; my husband ordered extra pork and he got a bowl of ramen full of pork--really soft and fatty chashu!

I was told you can only order ramen in the ramen side of the building.The ramen itself was excellent. We both ordered the tonkatsu broth (they also have spicy miso and veg). I chose chicken instead of pork or veg topping, with regular green onion and less sodium. You get half an egg for free. In hindsight, I would have ordered double noodles and regular sodium but I still enjoyed every bite! Other toppings are also available for a charge.The noodles are thin and go well with the broth, which is flavorful and not too fatty. The half egg was delicious and a perfect portion. I also added some of the chili oil to taste and pickled ginger from the condiments jars (wasn't sure if that was what it was meant for but I enjoyed that extra kick).I would definitely recommend to anyone in town wanting some ramen!"

It is thick and creamy, and probably the closest thing to Vancouver ramen I've had in Montreal. My only complaint is that I wish they'd serve more broth with their ramen. They only fill up the broth halfway up to where the ramen noodles are, so because of the broth's thickness, the broth ends up almost like a sauce instead.

The noodles were cooked perfectly and really held the thicker broth, so you were getting a full burst of flavor all at once. I also really like that you can choose the saltiness level of the broth. I loved the decor inside, and I'd say this is a great place to visit for a casual lunch on a weekend. It's definitely a must-visit!"

/user_details?userid=dtPwThab83h8LeHrm1ukAw,Phung V.,"La Habra, CA",5 star rating,This place doesn't take reservations so when I went there was 4 of us. The wait for us was a little over 1 hour which was well worth the wait because this is the best ramen I've ever had in my life (I haven't been to Japan yet). Maybe it was so good because I was starving but I don't think that was the reason. When the ramen came out it was piping hot and that's how I like it. I'm from California and we have a lot of good ramen places so I feel I have a good idea of what good ramen is. This place was amazing and the flavor was perfection. All four of us agreed this was one of the best ramen places in North America and 2 of us had been to Japan. We were all completely satisfied.

The staff were very friendly and the tonkotsu ramen is delicious - not too salty with great options for toppings.

The menu is limited though, they only offer two types of ramen. I ordered a chicken tonkotsu ramen and the green tea ice cream. Loved both of them.- Chicken tonkotsu ramen: The broth was delicious on its own: flavorful, rich, but not too thick or greasy, with a hint of sweetness. I ordered my ramen with less salt, but I find the level of saltiness perfect for me. The chicken was not dry at all, super juicy and tasty. The noodles were different from the other places I went to, they were thinner (usually at other ramen places they offer thicker noodles that are more chewy). I prefer thick and chewy noodles, but its just a personal preference, the thin noodles were still good. The egg was gooey in the middle, and was not too salty.- Green tea ice cream: Came with two green tea pocky. Tasted great. The ice cream was thick and didn't have a too bitter after taste despite the matcha flavor.The price is relatively fair. The interior is small but clean, with a cozy ambiance. You can see the chef in action since there is an open kitchen. Great place, gonna come back for sure!"

Hands down, 5 stars for Yokato Yokabai!Alright, so here is how it's done:(1) Choose your style: Not sure whether you want to get kara-miso (spicy) or tonkotsu (not spicy)? Don't fret, the broth is the exact same in both. Just ask to have the kara-miso with the spicy miso paste on the side. You see, there is always a solution at Yokato Yokabai!(2) Choose your meat: The chicken is thigh meat, which is tender and moist. The pork is from the belly, so it's fatty and delicious. Can't decide? Get both! (3) Check off your level of saltiness and whether you want green onions and/or seaweed and/or egg. (4)  GET THE KARAAGE!!!!!!!!!!! ... aka ""not-yo'-mama's-fried-chicken"" ... as an appetizer ... or dessert, for that matter! For those of you who aren't yet sold...It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, my fiancée and I were out shopping, and I was definitely getting hangry. Our friend had recommended Yokato Yokabai, so we figured there's no better time to check it out. Right away, the waiter took time to explain everything on the menu. I asked whether to choose chicken or pork, so he suggested I get both... hazzah! For $3 more, I got the best of both worlds. Not that the waiter didn't already impress me, but, while bringing me the ramen I ordered, he noticed the kitchen had given me double chicken instead of half chicken half pork. Without hesitation, he offered to bring the pork on the side. Now, that is smart customer service!Other notes:-- Gobo is root veg with spicy mayo-- Chasu-Don is rice with pork-- Vegetarian options exist... but I haven't tried them.-- Definitely try the 4 condiments in the small jars at your table. They all go well with the soup.-- There are water pitchers with lemon-flavoured water for you to take yourself!"

I actually was eating at Ichiego next door and ordered the ramen, as Ichiego also offers customized ramen from next door at their restaurant. I thought the was a fun, clever arrangement.However, way after my friends had received and devoured their dishes from Ichiego, no one at Ichiego were able to give me a straight answer about where my ramen was. I was told 3 times it was on its way before it arrived at the table, way after my friends' food and plates had been cleared. This was a major let down. They offered 50% off before I had to ask for it, but I think they should have taken it fully off the bill given the inconvenience. (My friends and I were also consequently late to our next plan because my meal was missing.)In terms of taste, it was very good. My tonkotsu ramen with chicken had maybe too many noodles per broth, but each ingredient was delicious, including the milky broth. It was the thickest tonkotsu broth I've ever had, including comparing to Japan and NYC. The ramen came with four small containers of things to add, including pickled ginger and mashed sesame seeds.Really bummed by the service but liked the final product overall. Maybe it was an off night, but I'm not sure I could fully recommend this spot given the issue with getting my dish."

It's my go-to ramen place in Montréal, and there's definitely a lot to love. You make your order on small sheets of paper, and the waiter will come around and collect them. I love their Tonkotsu ramen, which is made with a pork marrow bone broth. Delicious! You can customize your ramen with the degree of saltiness, amount of seaweed and eggs, and amount of green onions. They've changed their menu slightly, and now serve extra noodles on the side when you're ready for them. If you want extra noodles, don't forget to leave some broth so you're not eating brothless noodles. The restaurant has a great ambiance to it, and the service has always been fast and amiable. I've never tried their gobu fries, so that's something I look forward to during my next visit!Highly recommended!"

The second time I went, I waited in line for 30+ minutes just to receive luke-warm ramen with very little flavor! Not to mention that it made me sick AGAIN.

To be honest, it's probably both of us. For starters  I have to admit I'm just not a fan of this style of ramen, which is extremely rich and fatty. I'm more of a lighter broth kinda gal, and I really enjoy when ramen is packed with different veg and garnishes. I tried the tonkotsu-miso ramen. The broth was so heavy in pork fat, that it was essentially white and tasted like lard. I'm told by many that they love it, so I think it might just depend on your taste. I was also disappointed by the lack of diversity in the soup, which was lacking soup garnishes and vegetables to complete it. The two slabs of pork were so fatty, I could barely finish them. Extra veg options, like corn, would definitely be welcome. As for the space, it has a fun Japanese bar style, with wooden stools and cute seating area. The service was also prompt and friendly."

We went on a Sunday afternoon and the whole restaurant was empty and therefore, service was great!We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The portions are just right, the soup base was slightly on the salty side (but nothing like misoya) but quite heavy, the noodles were nice and chewy. What I really liked about this ramen store is their homemade spicy oil that's on the table. Its very flagrant and has a touch of garlic. If you like spicy food, I definitely suggest that you add some!However, we all got very thirsty not long after our meal (maybe too much salt in the soup?).

I felt so warm and happy after drinking it! I would suggest ordering it with less salt though - I ordered it with normal and I felt it was a little too salty for me. The meat was really, really tender. I also had the karage, which was so good. crispy but still moist inside. The dressing is what really elevates it. Ended it with matcha ice cream, which was perfect for cleansing your palate - makes me wonder if having hot green tea with the ramen would have really helped balance out that creaminess!"

(The place was supposed to open at 5pm!!!) We were asked if we wanted a table and we did, so we were redirected to the back of the restaurant which was... another restaurant? Basically, it's two different restaurants that are owned by the same people and they're kind of together. Anyways! We're given the menus of both restaurants and we order our ramen. The first thing I noticed was that the place was rather small, but not too tight. It was very intimate. The second thing I noticed was the decor. It's so beautiful! It has a very rustic feel and I just loved it!The food came rather quickly and the bowls were actually a pretty good size! I was very full at the end and my date was full. We were given a big wooden spoon type thing and a pair of chopsticks. It was a pretty cool way to eat. I've never used the big spoon before!Oh, but the best part was the flavour. Wow. Just, WOW! The broth was thick and flavourful, the ramen had a great texture, the presentation was nice, the pork was AMAZING! It actually melts in your mouth. Wow. Perfection. Just INCREDIBLE! I've never had ramen that was packed with so much flavour! And the waiter brought by 4 types of condiments including a spicy chili oil. Now, im very picky when it comes to chili oil, since i find that restaurants use bland oils. But this one was SPECTACULAR!! I used so much of it and it was actually, properly spicy! Not that fake spicy that you can't even taste! So just an amazing meal! And it was really cheap too! 13$ before Tax and tip. Since then, I've been craving ramen!!

We're always trying new ramen spots to find our new favourite spot, and in Montreal, Yokato Yokabai seems to be it.We decided to try the ramen house on a whim, wondering if the given high ratings were really true. With no big expectations, we entered Yokato Yokabai quite early in the evening before it got busy. It was relatively empty while we enjoyed our dinner, with more people entering as we left.The menu is quite simple; there are 2 types of ramen: tonkotsu and kara-miso, with an exception of vegetarian broth. There is no beef on the menu but pork, chicken, and vegetables. You can easily customize everything, from the saltiness of your broth, to how much egg you prefer, whether you want extra noodles or not. Since it was our first time, we decided to have the original portions and we picked a tonkotsu and kara-miso ramen each. We later ordered karaage to share as well, because the original portions didn't fill us up completely.The menu paper is for 1 person as there is a place to write your name if you prefer. This way, customization is free for everyone and it seems very organized in my opinion. The server doesn't have to write anything down either, so much more efficient.The ramen house was very small but it indeed felt like we were in Japan for a moment with the textured windows, and instead of having a big kitchen, it was kept simple and many of its condiments were kept at each table for easy access.There were 4 condiments available: pickled ginger, chili oil, roasted sesame seeds, and garlic oil. I wasn't accustomed to having ginger in my ramen too much, but it essentially balanced everything out in my ramen! Hubby and I loved having the option of adding ginger to our meal, and we kind of wish that it was available in every ramen house. We definitely both liked both the garlic and chili oils as they added enhanced flavours to the broth.Essentially, the ramens were the same with the exception of the miso paste in hubby's Kara-miso ramen. Anyway, we always taste our broth first before trying our ramen, and to our surprise, it really was authentic, legit Tonkotsu broth! Not sure what Tonkotsu is? Well, a direct translation of tonkontsu means pork-bone broth. It's densely rich with flavour and kind of creamy in colour as you can see above. This broth takes hours to make (literally!) and we're quite familiar with Tonkotsu as Koreans have a similar version of the broth also.One sip of this broth and we could definitely tell that the broth was well prepared and they were serious about their ramen! We especially loved the soft pork meat also, as it was really delicious and delicate. I also tried the chicken version of the tonkotsu ramen a week later which was just as delicious. We recommend that you add the pickled ginger and have it with your meats as it's really good that way. The cooked egg was very soft and its texture was amazing. I really can't stop about how good it was... so I'm going to stop here to save you time.We learned later that you can order the extra noodles when you're ready for them. The chefs don't automatically add an extra portion from the beginning as the noodles then would soak all the soup up, leaving you with no broth. So, you can ask your server for extra noodles when you're somewhat finished and ready for some more. The ramen bowls are quite small themselves so they wouldn't have fit all the extra noodles anyway.We ordered a side of Karaage to share and we really loved the tangy sauce it came with. The portions weren't too small but not too big either, and it seemed fair for the amount of money we paid. We're definitely going to try their chashu-don and desserts next time we're in!If you visit the ramen house at its busiest hour, you're bound to be waiting for a seat. The small but busy ramen house definitely deserves all the high ratings it's gotten and I know that hubby and I will be back soon for some more ramen, especially with the colder weather coming our way! If you've never been to Yokato Yokabai and you love ramen, you've got to stop by and try this place out. Tucked away on St. Denis, it's easy to pass the small ramen house. This will be our top recommendation for ramen in Montreal from now on!"

I realized the prices have increased on their menu by $1 for the ramen and $0.50 for their Karaage (except for their salad, extra noodle, extra meat, extra seaweed and ice cream). Only the extra 1/2 egg's price has lowered (used to be $1 and now it is $0.75)I decided to try their Tonkotsu chicken ramen with extra green onions this time. My ramen came pretty quickly despite the restaurant being quite packed! I added the crushed sesame seeds and a lot of their fried garlic (oil), which added a lot of flavor to my ramen. My friend added a bit of their chili oils and she said it was really spicy! I would definitely recommend you to add these free condiments because it makes the ramen even more tasty! I also find that the ramen broth was thicker and richer compared to my last visit to Yokato Yokabai and I like it even more!The washroom is really clean and pretty! It is worth paying a visit there!"
/user_details?userid=lpBBeJeKSXruAV__40s0XQ,James G.,"Saint Paul, MN",5 star rating,DOPE. Best ramen I've had in a while. It's very comparable to ichiran in Japan. It's small so you'll probably have to wait some while. It's attached to a nice Japanese styled bar. Very good spot and great atmosphere. The broth is not too heavy and the options for extras are limited which makes a greatly focused and well perfected broth.
/user_details?userid=2oaOWsfZjwA7a_yZETLdkg,Anna C.,"Greenville, SC",3 star rating,"3.5 stars from me! My mom, two year old daughter, and I trekked from downtown out to this quaint little ramen shop. It serves two variations of tonkotsu ramen -regular and slightly spicy. For each you can choose less salty/regular/more salty, less green onions/regular/more, etc for a few ingredients. We went with less salty for both and the taste was just fine, didn't feel lacking. We also had karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and it was so flavorful. The salad was tasty but beware the dressing is made with wasabi and caught both me and the kiddo off guard and caused a panicky reach for water. My two year old loved the food but a lot of the chairs are high tops at a counter type set up, so if you have a wiggle worm or a kid who hates booster seats (like mine), your experience might be less than peaceful as you try to make sure they don't fall while you slurp down your noodles. There is free wifi (just ask for password) and that is especially useful for foreigners needing to call an Uber for a lift home when you're so full."

The place was small so I could easily see this place being packed during lunch or dinner prime time. After sitting down, we were each given a paper to select the type of ramen and toppings that we wanted. My boyfriend ordered the tonkotsu while I had the kara-miso ramen. We also ordered the karage for appetizer.The karage was very good! It was crispy, not too overly dry on the outside, and juicy in the inside. Squirt some lemon over it and it was perfect. I also thought both broths of the ramen were good with it being rich and creamy. There was enough meat in my bowl which was tender. I ordered the normal size and thought it was a good amount for myself. To finish the meal, we shared a yuzu ice cream. SO good! Overall, I had a good time here and would come back if I have the chance to visit Montreal again. Very wonderful service too."

We went there on the recommendations of mutual friends of ours and, boy, I'm glad we went all the way there. Watch out as the restaurant doesn't stand out at all and could be mistaken for a private apartment. But that's part of the charm as well. We ordered some fried chicken to start and enjoyed it a lot but the best was yet to come. The ramen bowls were amazing and I say that knowing that I went to Japan and ate a lot of them. I had the same feeling at Yokato Yokabai. If you want some Japan in your Montreal just go there! You won't regret it and you'll thank me later."

If I could change one thing, it would be to have more tables in that place. Do make sure to avoid rush hours, as you will find yourself lining up at the door. But I promise you, it's worth the wait. Once you hand over your little piece of paper to the waiter, a bowl of ramen will arrive at your table on a timely manner. Pork portion is just so satisfyingly thick with barely any fat on it and the rest is history. Kidding! What I liked the most was the option to choose the level of saltiness in your broth, which is a detail for many but a huge plus for me. I find that salt will mask the purity of the real flavors. Enjoy!"

I ordered the chicken kakaage and it was AMAZING. It was crispy with ponzu sauce. Then I got the tonkatsu ramen with pork and some extras. It was good. The noodles are thin and similar to spaghetti. The broth had a creamy consistency. It was good but I wasn't blown away by anything but the pork. Seared so good! I would def recommend this place!. For the size of the portion it was well priced.

/user_details?userid=ZbgS4WttNQLyYn9zRD_htg,Ryan A.,"Yokosuka, Japan",3 star rating,"One of my favorite things to do when traveling is to find the city's best ramen place. This place had some great reviews, so we gave it a go.The seating in the ramen area was a bit uncomfortable, so you should expect to sit at a bar or near strangers. The ordering system consists of using a piece of paper and selecting what kind of ramen you want, as well as what (and how much) you want in it. The paper is in French and English, and is designed for one per person. If you try to put more than one order on one paper, the cooks will get confused (I overheard them complaining about this).I had the tonkatsu pork with normal saltiness and green onion, and half of an egg. The broth was much thicker than what I've had in other ramen places, which was strange but good. The noodles were really good, but overall I found the flavor to be a bit dull, like it needed more salt. There were the usual ramen ""condiments"" on the counter, such as garlic and what I think was sesame (it smelled like peanuts), but nothing spicy - turns out someone took it away to another table. So make sure you look around if you can't find it. The bathroom is located down a series of stairs which feels almost like a maze, and has some interesting artwork painted on the walls - it was traditional Japanese-style paintings of people in sexual positions with their privates pixelated. I thought it was funny and so random.It wasn't bad, and the service was good, but I have a hard time recommending it as a great ramen place."

The fact that they blame their customers instead of actually figuring out what went wrong with their order is also messed up. Also, get some air conditioning and a liquor license - hot and thirsty is not a good combo. Can't wait to see how crybaby Kev responds.--- update ---Kev baby (or baby Kev not sure which you prefer). Since you don't have a liquor license or air conditioning and since you have only whined instead of actually investigating what happened in your restaurant I can only assume that when you say it's not ok to post lies that you're talking about yourself and this is some kind of mild public self flagellation? It's okay baby, put a few more veggies in your soup and buy an air conditioner and it'll all be better. Shhhh."

The restaurant seems small and tight when you first walk in however it extends pretty far back with additional floors upstairs and downstairs. We ordered the Karaage Chicken, Tonkatsu Ramen, and the Spicy Miso Ramen - both with ""Normal"" saltiness, ""Regular"" noodles, and ""Char Sui Pork"". I thought the broth was a little bland. Maybe if I selected ""More Salty"" instead of ""Normal"" it probably would have been more flavourful. I didn't care for the texture of the noodles either. It didn't taste like authentic Japanese ramen noodles, but more artificial and chewy. I asked the waitress for a glass of hot water and Shichi-mi tōgarashi for my noodles but they didn't have any. What kind of ramen restaurant doesn't have Shichi-mi tōgarashi or hot water for that matter??? She said they only have green tea...ummm okay. On another note, the Char Sui Pork was super tender. I would say the pork was the highlight of the dish. The Karaage chicken was a tad oily but still tasty. The service was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, I would come back again on a cold night if I was craving for something warm and soupy but the next time I will order the ""More Salty"" broth or try some of their other items on the regular menu."

When I first came here, the Japanese food scene wasn't great so I'd go to NY or TO to get my J food fix. Now these guys are starting to close that gap so my transportation bill can go towards establishments here. :)I've had bowls of ramen at this joint, but this last time was a bit of a miss. When I saw a bowl coming out, there was one that had nori fall into the soup. Nori not supposed to be soggy, must be crisp which is why it's on the side. It wasn't my bowl luckily. I like my soups HOT especially when it just dropped 10 degrees outside from the day before. That first sip of the broth is supposed to soothe and excite. It was lukewarm at best. Took a bit with noodles and they were hot. So I mixed it around in the broth to distribute the heat, and it was warmer but still not as hot as I'd like it to be. Chashu could have also been roasted or seared a bit more. I look at other photos and some are roasted more.Yokato Yokabai is hands down the best ramen in town. Is it at the caliber of Ippudo or Santouka? Well, I'll let you be the judge of that.

/user_details?userid=y1jXfNPsBXQJ_vPDUFc7Fw,Daniel S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This ramen place is off on a side road and in a kinda shady looking area/building. However once inside you forget all that as you're greeted by the entire staff and a nice cozy atmosphere. If you're looking for alcohol head right down the hall to the bar connected to it (Ichigo Ichie: you're in for an absolutely wonderful time). The staff seem fairly attentive no matter how busy it gets, and the ordering system is pretty new to me (you check off what you want on a slip of paper, not exactly unique but I'm more used to ordering off a menu!) the prices seem pretty normal for the ramen. The other items are a bit pricey ($4.50 for a rather small scoop of ice cream!?). The ramen itself is very hearty and not to mention delicious but not very filling, I'm a big eater and the extra noodles for $2 still left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. The noodles were fairly average however the soup, meat, and veggies were amazing. I also got the Karaage to-go for a small midnight snack on the bus back to Toronto. It was tasty but dripping with oil and you don't get a lot for what you pay.All in all this place, like most other Japanese places, are places you go for the taste and atmosphere over ""bang for your buck"". If you're looking for a cheap fill, I'd suggest heading over and looking at Ichigo Ichie's menu or any run-of-the-mill Chinese place. Unfortunately, the portions seem a tad bit too small considering everything so they'll have to settle for a comfortable 4 stars."

They also give you an option for saltiness level (less, normal, or more), as well as how many green onions you want.  I opted to add lotus root to mine, but they had a decent selection of extras you could add to your dish.  I would also recommend the karaage (fried chicken); they were delicious and fried very nicely, with a garlic/mushroom/soy topping.The yuzu ice cream was also something different than what is offered at most restaurant.  The consistency of the ice cream similar to a sorbet yet also reminiscent of a meringue.  It was a good way to end the meal.Overall, food was tasty and decently priced, but the wait is a bit long."
/user_details?userid=NsVk0J1H_JzNRzzlswOV3g,Victoria C.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Been to this restaurant twice now: it's really the best ramen one can find in downtown Montreal. Still doesn't live up to the greatness of Ippudo or any of its franchises, but it's very enjoyable in itself. Both times I've ordered ramen with the tonkatsu broth, with more salty soup, extra green onion, and pork belly. Second time, I ordered extra pork belly: be sure you're prepared if you ordered this, because I think they gave me more than double the regular portion! Bamboo shoots are also a very nice, thoughtful addition that I wouldn't normally find in ramen restaurants here. Would also recommend adding the fried garlic in the provided condiments on the table. Broth was thick and flavorful, noodles were pretty ordinarily good, spoon was a little annoying to use but not a huge problem. I also split the chicken karaage, which was very good (especially with that dressing), but not as worth it to me given the portion size and the price. Be sure to try the yuzu ice cream, because it's impossible to find elsewhere: really is a treat, even if you're stuffed.Ambiance is nice, and the service is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Walking into the restaurant itself can get you really hungry. One of the best parts is that from the outside, it's really understated! I'm a fan of the high tables/booths too, but I've only been in the non-alcoholic section.Only complaints I can give are that it's a touch expensive for a college student, but worth it as a pick me up. Also, possibly just me, but I would have loved a little more soup in my bowl. Otherwise, portion sizes are big and hearty. I recommend this place to all of my friends!"

I never knew that creamy broths in ramen were a thing until I came here. Since then, I've been to a few more restaurants that made creamy broths (I was serious about my quest to finding great ramen), and none have been as good as Yokata Yokabai's.And then there's the pork. So tender that it literally melts in your mouth. Also the homemade ice cream!!! The greatest dilemma is figuring out if you want to get the green tea or yuzu ice cream. After getting through the ramen you're so full and only really have room for one ice cream, and both are just sooooooo good. The place is really cozy and cute. It can get super busy around peak time. Location is great, service is great, and food is ah-mazing. 100% recommend this place!!!"

I had the tonkatsu ramen, with chicken karaage for starters, and green tea ice cream for desert. I would usually have a pint of Sapporo with a bowl of ramen, but they do not sell alcohol (if you go to Ichie Ichigo though, they do sell alcohol, and I believe it is the same ramen, as the two restaurants are connected). Chicken karaage was good, but I prefer when the pieces are a bit smaller, it is just easier to eat. I also think  the chicken karaage wasn`t crunchy enough.Ramen was simply excellent. Broth is amazing, it was not too heavy/greasy,and gave a comforting feeling, don`t really know how to describe it. The pieces of pork were just so good, fatty, tender, perfect seasoning. Then I had the green tea ice cream. Bruh, that **** was heaven in a cup. I think they do it themselves."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow, a good Japanese restaurant in Montréal that isn't ridiculously pricey and is good for eating alone as well as in groups? Ladies and gentleman, Yokato Yokabai takes the cake! Located a half mile walking distance from my apartment, it serves up surprisingly authentic Hakata ramen and side dishes to go along with it, in addition to having a multi-tiered shelf full of Japanese goodies that take me back to my childhood. Everything is made fresh in the kitchen, which is open-air so you can see the food being made! Places like this have long been overdue, and it lives up to the hype.I went in relatively early in the dinner shift, so I was able to just be seated at the bar with no problem. They give you slips of paper that have all of the menu options on them, and you just check off what you want. I ordered the karaage (like Japanese-style chicken nuggets), the kare-miso tonkatsu ramen, and the green tea ice cream. Upon biting into my first piece of crispy, crunchy karaage, I was once again correct in stating that Asians really do know how to fry their chicken. Not only was the outside not soggy at all, but it was super juicy and tender on the inside and had this magical sauce-like stuff on top that gave it that extra dimension. I would have ordered another plate of that straight off the bat if I didn't have more dishes to try haha. Next came the main show - the ramen. Personally, I loved all of the components - including the egg being cooked with a deliciously gooey center, crunchy nori, and fatty pork that just melts in your mouth - except for the noodles. Now, I know that Hakata ramen noodles are thinner than their Hokkaido ramen counterparts, and I hold a personal preference for thicker noodles due to their ability to soak up more of the broth. It was still good nonetheless, and I also found the thick broth to actually have somewhat of a kick unlike what most Montréal Asian restaurants advertise as spicy (aka nothing at all), but I still would have called it in between mild and medium at best. Finally, green tea ice cream is always a hit with me, and this time was no different. They served it up in these wooden boxes and garnished it with green tea Pocky, making it look super pretty and cute! All good things must come to an end, however, so I reluctantly left before I had a chance to buy some of the snacks along the wall.Yokato Yokabai serves up really tasty, moderately-priced Hakata ramen in a cozy environment. While I don't necessarily think that it was worth paying $14.50 for a bowl (using Nouilles de Lan Zhou as a reference point since they give you so much more for cheaper), I still want to come back and try the other sides. In particular, the chasu-don and fried burdock root look extremely appetizing, so maybe I'll just order a bunch of small plates and have a light meal next time I come here."
/user_details?userid=r4Kac9JDnig5oCO8-tNFmQ,Melody M.,"Rowland Heights, CA",4 star rating,"I think the one word to describe the ramen here is: creamy. Which didn't really bother me since I love creaminess, but it does compromise seasoning and such because of how thick it is. The chicken meat was super tender and delicious though so I would recommend getting the chicken! We came at a relatively good time and was seated and given orders relatively quickly, which was a plus. I also had the green tea ice cream and that was a really nice end to the meal. If you're very much into sour though, I would recommend their Yuzu ice cream. Also, them playing some Nujabes just warms my heart :3"

But maybe that's 'cause most places don't do it like Yokato Yokabai.They have two kinds of Ramen on the menu, and they're both killer. It probably has something to do with how they sent the chef to Japan to learn just what the f*ck is up when it comes to Ramen.In fact, everything on the menu is good. Just do it. Go here, order Ramen and appetizers, and eat yourself into a food coma. You won't regret it."

/user_details?userid=ThTUiH1fiRTXDqwH_NZHfg,Albert H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"I was in town for a long weekend and this ramen joint was near the AirBnB I was staying at so decided to get a quick bite. I went a warm day and the inside of this place was a bit on the hot side, probably from all the ramen broth boiling. Luckily, they had a backroom which was just as roomy and much cooler. Yokato Yokabai is a nicely designed ramen shop with both bar and table seating. Service was exceptionally friendly here. Orders are taken by marking off what you want on a piece of paper which is simple and easy in my opinion. I went with the tonkotsu ramen with extra char su. This ramen comes with the thin straight noodles which is traditionally served with tonkotsu styled broth. I do however prefer the thick and wavy noodles. I wish they provided that as an option. When I got the ramen shortly after ordering, I found the flavors were on point but the broth was way too thick. Rather than being a broth, it was more like gravy.  It was so thick I was tempted to dilute the broth with water. The char su was thick but a bit limp.  It didn't have any char on it. It was more like a boiled piece of sloppy pork belly meat. I would recommend that they broil it under a hand torch for a minute or two before serving. I was also able to sample the chicken karaage which was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the outside. Overall, I've had better ramen however this place isn't a bad option if you are seriously craving ramen and are in the area. And again, service was super friendly and accommodating."

I visited this place in January but didn't write the review till now. I believe that food quality is more important for star ratings than service so I will give a positive star rating but I have to mention the service. The waiter wouldn't take my order assuming I was waiting for a friend although I asked for a table for one. Pretty embarrassing having to try and flag him down while he served couples (took their orders and brought their food out) that had come in after me. I had completed the little order slip and had it sitting on my table while I tried to get his attention, so it's not like I wasn't obviously ready to order.I was conveniently sitting next to the  cups and pitchers of water meant to be served to customers. This turned about to be a good thing because I had to just grab a cup and serve myself after waiting for quite a while. I should note I came for lunch, right when they opened on a weekday. I got his attention eventually and he seemed a bit annoyed at me."
/user_details?userid=MZ2eEtdLsfOGLFa0U_Rk9g,Bong B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The most authentic ramen of Montreal!If Yokato Yokabai is one of the best ramen restaurants of Montreal, that is clearly because it's the closest to what you can find in Japan. The texture of the noodles, the smoothness of the soup, the slices of meat and vegetables, there's no doubt! And if some remain skeptical, they just have to hear the chefs speaking to know that they truly are Japanese.The success of the restaurant makes it crowded very often. So don't be surprised if you end up waiting in line. And because it's not that big, the place is also very loud, which doesn't ruin the experience knowing that ramens are meant to be eaten loudly anyway. However, the service could be better...I recommend it to those who want to have an authentic Japanese experience, between friends, with family, or as a couple.

Secondly: Asian vegetables already exist and are inexpensive. Why not utilise bok choy and lotus root instead? I could not even finish my meal, it was so disgusting. If you are a vegetarian, give this place a miss.On the plus side, the setting was spacious and quiet, the service was decent and apparently the meat ramen was good."

You'll receive the traditional Ohayo gozaimasu that many businesses greet you with in Japan. The staff is young & friendly however not very attentive. I had to get up a few times to get water from the pitcher myself. Prices are average for a ramen restaurant in Montreal. I went to it's partner location next door & I'll write a review for that one later.They do not serve alcohol on this side. They do not take reservations in the evenings.The food was good but not amazing. You place your order on a sheet of paper & check off the options you want. Vegetarian broth is available. I had the kara-miso chicken this time with the whole egg & 1 piece of seaweed & no sides,just straight ramen. The broth is...how do I describe it? Creamy/Milky? Not spicy considering I opted for the kara miso but maybe Texas has gotten me used to potent habanero peppers! I would not recommend going above with the normal saltiness level unless you're a salt fiend. I might bring it down to the less option if I go back. The chicken was moist though,I'll give them that much. Overall good but I've had better ramen in different cities."

Service was unobtrusive yet efficient, just the way I like it!I do have to comment on the bathrooms.  Getting to them felt like a little adventure.  Down a few steps, around a corner, past a window looking into another dining room, a few more steps, another corner and on and on.  The restaurant has put up lots of little signs so you don't get lost.  I alternate between being amused and a little bit annoyed. What about people with mobility issues?  If the couple of steps out front didn't deter them, I sure hope they don't have to go to the bathroom!I will definitely be back, that's for sure.  The location is perfect for ducking in for a quick lunch while shopping on St Denis."

I may sometimes poor some of the water into the soup to dilute it a bit (I do find it a tad salty). Noodles are hand-pulled and always on point.When I've had enough of the ramen, I'll order either the fried chicken or the bowl of rice with pork belly. Super cheap but doesn't constitute a meal.It may be worth mentioning, but I've been to this restaurant at different times on different days. The broth was off twice out of the 7-8 times I've been.

While I enjoyed my ramen, allow me to make a few constructive feedback: the slice of pork was a tad too thick and fatty (though tasty!), the egg should be served warmer and could use a bit more marinating, while the broth was a bit 'flat'. I did really like the karaage chicken; I have nothing but good things to say on this one.The service was prompt and friendly, the price reasonable for the neighbourhood and for Japanese fare in general.

This is the second time I have ramen in Montreal and it's the second time I get super thick broth. So thick there's barely any liquid. I was glad my food comrades, whom are less critical, agreed and one was even tempted to poor water into the bowl to make it a thinner broth. The flavor was okay and somewhat fine in authenticity (meat flavor was there), but the broth (which is the ""meat and potatoes"" of a ramen dish) was so off and so dense that it kinda defeated the purpose. Karaage was yummy. Gobou was on point. Salad was refreshing, but the dressing has wasabi so careful if you you're not into wasabi. Service was fine, the guy seemed really busy and a bit overwhelmed. Not particularly the kindest... probably because he was stressed? The side of the restaurant we were on, we couldn't order alcoholic beverages. A little strange, especially since the other part was full and the only place available was in the booze-free zone. Again, pretty mediocre experience. Nothing to write home about especially when you've had mind-blowing ramen before. I'll keep trying to find the best ramen bowl in town!"

When we first arrived we had to wait some time, even though the other half of the restaurant had open seats at the bar. The wait staff was slow, and not particularly hospitable.

There are two parts to the restaurant: ramen and tapas, which have their own entry and hours. Both are popular and there could be a significant wait, or they run out of something. To dine on the tapas side you need to order drinks (I assume has to be alcoholic).Service was good and consistent while food was awesome. Even my kids enjoyed so price wasn't an issue for me."
/user_details?userid=ppUS3G3bVNNqvjAKsi1BbA,Jinny L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I chose the tonkatsu broth and it was thick and rich from the oils of the meat, but surprisingly a bit bland. Although you can definitely taste the meaty broth, I could barely taste any salt so I had to add in my own. On the good side, the noodles were chewy, and the chicken topping was tender and well spiced. We also got the fried chicken, and gobo fries as a side, and although they were good, the portions were small and were not very note-worthy nor was it worth the price. I might sound highly critical--but in all honestly, the ramen was good/ok, but just a bit of a let down from all the rad reviews."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried the miso tonkatsu ramen for lunch.The good:- Broth is quite tasty. They even allow you to request how salty you like it, which is nice considering there seems to be a lot of variety in saltiness in ramen broth in town.- Service is friendly and attentive.- Decor is modern and comfortable.- Prices are on the high end for ramen, but still reasonable.- Pork was very tender and tasty.The meh:- Music was some crazy 90s dance music remix, Japanese style. Kind of aggravating, but I'm a bit of a music snob.- Noodles were quite thin. Not the kind of ramen noodles I'm used to. I prefer mine with more bite and more body. Not particularly satisfying.- A little modest on the portion sizes.- Soft boiled egg came straight out of the fridge, so it was still cold.With the proliferation of ramen places, it's tricky to choose sometimes. For choices in the Plateau, I definitely prefer this over Ramen-ya, Misoya, and Saka-ba, but Kazu still takes the prize for me."

The pork soup ramen is to die for, was flavourful and right amount of spice. I think the broth is actually the best because I usually leave some but in the case drink every once left!!! On the downside I don't think the pork is that flavourful (After trying chicken ramen I think chicken is worst very bland.).                                                                                I also enjoyed the fried chicken which is the best I've had in any Asian restaurant, the secret is the herbs, sesame and soy based  sauce they add once it's done and it's not too greasy. There's also plenty of cocktails, sake and drinks on the menu which was quite nice ;)We were a large group everything went smoothly good dishes to share and wide selection. I will definitely come back maybe every week lol"

It would be half an hour wait. I was thinking if it was worth it. I asked the people coming out and they all said it was good. I ordered Tonkatsu broth with chashu. Both were flavorful. The chashu melted in my mouth. It was not quite the same as what I had in Japan but it was delicious.

It's a small place and they don't push you out as soon as you're done, which is probably why you usually have to wait so long.

This place was DELICIOUS. We came in the middle of the day on a Thursday for a late lunch, it was not packed at that hour. There were real Japanese customers, already a good sign. Service was great, our waiter was attentive and open to questions. We had the tonkotsu soup, thick noodle-whole egg-pork belly-spicy miso option with gobo and fried chicken appetizers. The gobo was small but beautifully made, each fry perfectly seasoned and perfectly battered. The fried chicken had 4 pieces, perfectly battered, perfectly fried with this green mustard (?) sauce ?? I don't know but it was freaking delicious. Our only regret was not getting the extra noodle because the broth was so damn good, we needed more noodle to soak up the broth to enjoy. Yes, which brings me to the broth. Have you ever made ramen broth? It takes a whole day to simmer and melt all that fat, my brother in law made it once and it was L-O-N-G but so so so delicious. It is heavy though which is why the noodle is necessary. And this broth was legit. Which is why, if you are a grown adult, I highly recommend getting some extra noodle to fully enjoy. I will be coming back. In fact, I want to come back with the kids and the waiter was kind enough to suggest coming at 5 as it gets crowded towards 6/7."

The noodles are amazing and my egg was done very nicely. Don't pass on the sides either, the karaage is probably the best I've had outside Japan. Yokato Yokabai clearly takes great care in the food they're putting out and it shows. If you're looking for an authentic ramen experience look no further."

I ordered the Tonkatsu pork ramen with extra green onion, extra seaweed, and extra soya egg. The broth was very rich, maybe a little bland for me, but still delicious. Please order the kara-age (fried chicken appetizer). It was amazing! And you have to end the meal with a yuzu sorbet. The bits of citrus rind in it gave it an interesting texture and a slightly bitter taste that was perfect with subtly sweet sorbet. Also, if you order multiple items on the menu you save money. You'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you visit Montréal and don't eat here. Yokato Yokabai is a do not miss!"

Yes, there was lotus root and green onions (those strike me more as garnishes though). The changes you have made to this dish are terrible and make the restaurant come off as really stingy. In short: the soup was awful. Which is a shame, because it used to be really good. (And I'll add that the arrogant way that you handle complaints could use some work.

Also, first time I went there was a laminated infographic explaining all the items on the menu. Didn't need it, but for people like foreigners who know nothing about Japanese food, it is extremely useful. On my second visit it was nowhere to be found or offered by the staff, and it took very long just for the aggressive waiter to even look in our direction to have us seated. It was midday on a weekend. Also, use your entire space more efficiently if the izakaya portion is not yet open.

Simple menu which is what ramen bars should be like. Five ramens and four sides to choose from. Not one of those restaurants with countless pages of ramen styles which makes me confused. Friendly staff. Karaage was really tasty. Made to order. Crispy with a warm, tender centre with sprinkles of seaweed and sesame seed. The ramen was well presented. It had two pieces of pork belly...it should come with three pieces. The egg was tasty, salty with a soft, creamy yolk. The pork belly was bland and limp. The noodles were too thin! It felt like eating Chinese egg noodles, I think it may even be just that! The Karaage saved this place but the ramen was a disappointment! Does not compare to Toronto or New York. Where is a good ramen place in Montreal?"
/user_details?userid=-6INbtn3i61aHyJhDml_Lw,Karin C.,"Laval, Canada",2 star rating,Very very thick broth. I personally found it a bit too heavy and thick because it left this really awkward after taste. Noodles were perfect. My friend tried the chicken tonkotsu and I think the chicken was sweet. The sweetness of the chicken didn't match the broth. Pork tonkotsu was really good although I got sick of the flavour at the end.

Yet right after eating his Tonkotsu chicken ramen, my husband had a severe allergy reaction. We still don't know what caused it even after calling them.Overall I'd say it was a pretty horrible experience for us."

It's a little pricier then your standard ramen joint as it's a full on funky spot and you can also order your ramen just like you want - salty.. sea wood..1/2 egg full egg or seaweed. One bowl is plenty for lunch for dinner I would order a side.

They also have lovely soy eggs. The chashu I found a bit thin, but overall really nice. One thing they should definitely consider adding to the menu: Tsukemen Ramen and offering an extra serving of noodles for the broth. Other than that, really lovely."

The meats were tender and flavorful and the broth was creamy. Everything went well with a glass of Sapporo. The appetizer and bowl of ramen cost about $20. The service was efficient and the servers were friendly. Overall a great experience - well worth a trip!"

The second time around, it was not nearly as good as the first time; the broth was way too fatty and even a little bland.  The pork belly was not charred at all and it was limp. So I think there might be a consistency issue here.  Service was also very basic, with a very young and inexperienced waiting staff.Also, when you arrive, they ask you if you plan on drinking alcohol or not and if you do, they direct you to the ""pub"" section at the back of the restaurant, or is it another restaurant altogether? Not sure...   anyway, everything was fine until a family of four with two babies insisted on being seated in the bar section. They were seated riiiiight next to us. There shouldn't be babies allowed in the adult section; I , for one, wasn't in the mood for all the whining and ""baby talk"". Just my opinion.It's kinda sad, but I do have to say there are better ramen spots in town and this one is indeed just another trend (read hype) on the Plateau."

/user_details?userid=pv9NRoc_9WFrSPOd5ec6nA,Sharon L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Perfectly decent ramen! The Chicken karagge was delicious. Broth was flavourable and the noodles are cooked just right. I also loved the simple furnishing and the homely atmosphere - great place to be on a date or with a small group of friends. The downside is though, I'd expect larger portions and more meat for a bowl of ramen that costs between $12-15. Two slices of pork are not quite enough if they're charging that price range for a bowl. One could easily find a ramen place in Vancouver or Toronto for the same quality, same portions for around $8-10 CAD. But then again, Montreal's not really the city to be if you want to find cheap, decent asian food. All in all, this place is pretty decent for Montreal standards. But the quality of the ramen isn't enough to make up for the small portions and high price."

Almost everything, including the garlic and chile oils on the table are made in house. The only thing on the wish list is a veg friendly sous-vide egg. For dessert we tried the green tea ice cream, a favorite of the server, and he did not steer us wrong. Not overly sweet and filled with a pleasant green tea flavor. We will definitely come back!"

The thick creamy umami of the tonkotsu with springy noodles and the classic pork and ramen condiments, with choices of sesame, roasted garlic oil, hot sauce, red ginger on the table. This is what I would hope to be authentic Japanese ramen - the place being tucked away definitely contributed to the mysterious ambience.The waitress didn't seem too happy about what she was doing but she was probably too busy to express her excitement. She did her job.Homemade Japanese ice cream looked sketchy coming out of a Hellman's mayo bucket, but what doesn't spell ""homemade"" more than that?"

You can alter your ramen the way you like it - less salt, more noodles, etc. The Tonkatsu ramen broth is very tasty. It's creamy but not overpowering and the pork melts in your mouth. The homemade green tea ice cream is also delicious. Their chasu don is VERY GOOD. Nothing on their menu was disappointing for me. Great for a hangover meal. The service was also attentive and friendly."
/user_details?userid=K9OaplzNLTN_jVdxFsLd2w,Floop D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very simple menu. 2 main dishes with variations, a few snacks and dessert. Legit, fantastic pork bone broth ramen! Before the arrival of Yokato Yokabai there was no real ramen in Montreal. (I tried them all.. we are far behind here) Check off your choice and ratio of ingredients  (broth type, saltiness, egg, seaweed etc) on a little paper card and let it take on a life of its own. This is a hot bowl of pure comfort. I can only recommend the tonkatsu broth- as this is their specialty and they do it so well. Fantastic service! Careful and attentive employees.The not so good- 2 things- dessert and seatingDessert- I was really excited about yuzu ice cream the first time I went- as I love yuzu anything, but it was definitely lemon rind flavored, without a hint of yuzu.  A local competitor makes a yuzu beer which keeps us all going back. I'm sure you can deliver on your claims.  This is the best ramen! However, it is not a comfortable place to be. The height and depth of the furniture is kinda off. You have to squeeze by other people and into the seats where your feet will dangle and you can't lean back. I know that a Japanese Ramen House is supposed to have a quick turnover, but this set-up has not been thought out to deliver even that. I'm sure they are losing customers because of it. There are only 3 tables like that however- so if you come alone or with one friend, you can sit at the bar and not worry about it."
/user_details?userid=Iqwbqd1PdmGqxINSbrb-3A,Dahlia P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Solid ramen place...finally! I've been coming here since it opened in Spring 2015 and had it not been for the sign on the sidewalk I would've missed it completely. I am thoroughly impressed and pleased that this has been the best ramen I've tasted in Montreal so far. Quick, top notch service (with surprisingly spacious bathroom area!). The broth is of the right consistency: milky texture, fatty and flavourful. I typically get the tonkotsu with 5 pieces of seaweed and extra soft boiled egg. While they serve you the meal sort of bareboned, the extra free condiments of sesame seeds, ginger, garlic oil and spicy oil are a welcomed touch. I like to add heavy scoops of garlic oil (with the garlic shavings at the bottom) - it makes a huge difference! Chasu meat could use some work in being more generous in giving us more meat and less fat, and soft boiled eggs are marinated, but always too cold upon serving. Otherwise, this is my go-to Ramen shop in the city, and am glad that other people have taken notice of this place, as it is much deserved to be praised. I was a little worried of the lack of patrons when I first went in May, but now it has a healthy night time crowd during weekends. Desserts also deserve a little shout out of tasty treats, the green tea ice cream topped with green tea Pocky sticks is always a nice touch.**Update Nov 2016** They've greatly improved their chasu meat, it's now thicker, meatier than before, thus I've upgraded it to five stars. It's now so busy, you'll start queueing outside much like how you would stand around for Kazu. Food has been consistently good, so don't miss out on this gem!"

The moment I stepped in, I felt like I was at a cozy local ramen store in japan (thanks for playing some Utada Hikaru!). It was the only Japanese restaurant that I visited in Montreal that actually had Japanese cooks. I liked that the menu was simple (miso or tonkotsu ramen, a couple appetizers). I had the pork tonkotsu ramen, and it was delicious--just as good as the ones I've had in Japan! The broth was very thick. The chashu (pork) was a little too fatty for me..but I'm just not a fan of super fatty meat. I also wish they had shoyu (soysauce) ramen, but maybe it's not possible to add to the menu given the small kitchen. I would definitely recommend this place for an authentic ramen experience.

The exterior of the restaurant is unassuming. The interior is warm and woodsy with small tables and bar seating - much better ambiance than other ramen places I've been to but might be uncomfortable for some people to sit on stools. The ramen house is connected to a bar/Japanese grub place... They're basically the same restaurant but you can order drinks and other foods if you are sitting on the other side, which is where we were seated. To order the ramen, you check off your preferences from a small piece of paper. The other food is listed on a simple paper menu. My hubby had the vegetarian ramen while I had the spicy pork. Both of us thorough enjoyed it and agreed it was the best ramen we've had so far. Broth was thick, flavorful, not too salty and could be customized with condiments brought to the table - sesame seeds, fried garlic, pickled radish and chili oil. My miso egg was perfectly soft boiled.... Delicious! And the pork was fatty and melt in your mouth tender just the way I like it. The ramen noodles are thinner than I am used to but they were well cooked and had a good bite. I have to admit that our appetizers were just ok. We had the Kara-age (friend chicken) and a fried root veggie (forgot the name). We also had green tea tiramisu and green tea ice cream for dessert which were a perfect ending to an excellent meal."
