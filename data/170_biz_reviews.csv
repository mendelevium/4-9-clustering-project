The pork was perfectly cooked, the rice was delicious, and the spicy sauce was on point. 10/10 would go again and I look forward to trying their other dishes, especially that fried chicken. Price was reasonable, service (takeout) was quick."

We shared a porc bibimbap bowl, a tofu bao, a salad and a kombucha drink. All were delish! I would recommend trying the bibimbap bowl. Those four items were about 40$. Also, the owner and staff are very friendly."

On top of that, the food was great!! I had the chicken bibimbap, very tasty!! For desert these lemon ginger muffin? Squares lol don't recall if there were muffins but they were a perfect balance of not too sweet and zingy!!"
