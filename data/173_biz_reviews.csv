/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Got some Taiwanese style fried chicken to go from Le Majesthé.Majesthé serves Asian fusion dishes and bubble tea. This is a hidden gem in downtown! Their bubble tea is SO GOOD!! I've tried this restaurant numerous times and I've been craving for some Taiwanese fried chicken, so I must order some for take-out. The fried chicken was so crispy which made me crave for a steamy hot bowl of rice to pair with it. Although, there was a VERY generous amount of garlic which made the dish super spicy.They also have a bar called Bar Majesthé which is located in the basement of the restaurant. I am looking forward to try it out!!Taiwanese Style Fried Chicken ($6.50)"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A contemporary Asian-fusion restaurant, perfect for a quick lunch, dinner or even for grabbing a drink! We entered around 5pm and the place was fairly empty so our friendly waitress let us choose our table. We took one of the banquet spots at the back with a great view of the restaurant. It is brightly lit inside with a chic and stylish minimal interior. Within an hour though, the place was completely packed, mainly with students as it is so close to McGill. Browsing through the menu, I was worried that there would not be many options for vegetarians however, I was pleasantly surprised. For starters, we had the sweet potato fries and fried avocado bao. For these two items alone, I would happily return to MajesThé. The sweet potato fries were truly out of this world, big thick pieces with an addictive sweet and sour outer crunchy layer served with a spicy mayo dip. And the bao - OMG! It was a first experiencing fried avocado and definitely won't be the last. Chunky pieces of avocado coated in a hot crispy shell topped with purple cabbage and veggies inside a fluffy steamed bun. For our mains, the hubby and I both opted for the Salmon Fried Rice; super fragrant and flavourful jasmine rice tossed with marinated salmon, bean sprouts, tofu, green onions, soy sauce, tobiko and scrambled eggs - just wow! We were spoilt for choice with the drinks menu, it was hard to narrow it down. I had the Winter Melon Milk Tea with boba whilst the hubby devoured his Galaxy Lemonade with boba and lychee jelly. I definitely preferred the latter as you can really taste the freshly squeezed lemonade - that mixed with organic cane sugar was just a heavenly combination!Overall, a wonderful experience at MajesThé; great location, lots to choose from, reasonable pricing and outstanding service! Highly recommend :)"
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This review is not for the restaurant, in part. It is for the downstairs bar that is open on Thursday and Fridays as of this writing.There was an event held here, and instead of going into the restaurant we went into the basement where a moody, dim lit wide space was available with a bar. Lots of seats and tables scattered throughout and even couches.The bar served us spirits that were done with some kind of twist. For starters, they had a ""jelly/boba"" peach cocktail that was surprisingly refreshing, if maybe a bit too sweet. But you got the boba experience with the big straw and chewy jellies. They also had traditional milk boba tea with some homemade Irish cream that was boozy too if you want to go classic. I had a take on an old fashioned, no boba, but more on the sweeter side as well. It was an enjoyable sweet though! They had a bunch of other regular spirit suggestions but it was a limited menu for that night. Prices were average, like $12-14 for a signature cocktail, nothing outrageous but not exactly cheap either.The place was pretty crowded so the bar was a bit swamped with only 2 people manning it. And when I wanted to pay for a drink, it took additional time to pay because they were still doing drink tickets. If you're going to host events, maybe have another bartender around. But, that being said, Jimmy the bartender was happy and pleasant to interact with despite the crowd! He was so nice and paid attention to what he was doing. He carefully explained drinks too while making them when people asked questions. Such a trooper!This is where the restaurant comes in though. The food was even better than the drinks. They do Asian fusion with a focus on Taiwanese dishes. It was really good! I enjoyed every plate I tried. From tofu to spiced beef skewers to bonito flake sprinkled chips. My favorite was the karaage. Even the milk cake dessert was really impressive.I highly recommend coming by here if not for the restaurant, if the food is the same or better, but also checkout the hidden bar downstairs. You may like what you find. And again, understatement of the year, super friendly staff! I'll be back myself for sure."
/user_details?userid=JuzGYnX2zArwZMM-5IhZHQ,Erika D.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite place to go for lunch time by McGill university. I've been going for quite some time now (from the very beginning to now, when they newly opened a bar). I am so happy that they've grown so much in the last year because they really deserve all the positivity they get! The food is reasonably priced, super flavourful, comforting and leaves you SO full! My favourite is the braised pork rice. It is decadent and after I eat it I feel warm and happy. I also like their karaage. Very juicy on the inside, crispy and fragrant on the outside. I hope to try more of their dishes soon.I had the opportunity to try their bar items. Drinks are tasty and even though they were swamped, service was still delightful and kind! Their bubble teas are amazing. I really enjoy their classics (winter melon, milk teas) and their boba is perfectly cooked. The bar was beautiful and very speakeasy-esque. Also very clean. The space upstairs (the restaurant) is very different from the bar. It's very light and airy. I really like the difference between the two spaces! Like I've already mentioned, the service is fantastic. They really care about their clients and make sure you're satisfied with everything. Your water is always full. Such a sweet set of staff."
/user_details?userid=8Ggt4vDYC73pv5wfYTPJsw,Zoejaiwah F.,"Fort McMurray, Canada",5 star rating,"This fusion restaurant was amazing, the food, the bubble tea offerings. The staff, all were amazing; I'm starting to see and notice a trend that Quebec takes dining very seriously. Haven't visited a restaurant that disappointed thus far, this one wasn't short on the offerings or excitement.I hope to visit soon and try more of their offerings, happy dining."
/user_details?userid=gsZlJJ9gOjGi0kDIxYlBag,Ellen L.,"Arvada, CO",4 star rating,"We ate dessert here and it was fine, if you like this sort of thing. I am not a fan of all the bubble tea and matcha stuff but my friends thought it was really good. I would like to try dinner here in the future because I think I would have enjoyed it more than I did dessert. The galaxy lemonade is really cool looking though! My friend who drank it said it was good."
/user_details?userid=UoHpP1BQ_A-PFiu3VT75ug,Annie N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love the place . Both Food and service was great . Thanks to yelp and local staffIf you want a special cocktail, try downstairs. They even have bubble tea cocktails. And deserts are wonderful . I tried milk cake"
/user_details?userid=hGJhZ6Z-sG5ux9yzZc406g,Juna S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went with my friend on a cold night. We were both starving so we ordered karaage fried chicken,Poké bowl and miso spaghetti. For drink we ordered roasted oolong milk tea and earl grey milk tea. The potions weren't big but filled us up. The spaghetti tastes pretty good and it's quite creative since it combines spaghetti with Japanese style dressing, along with green peas and radish, tasty.However, the karaage disappointed me because it was toooo sweet. The Poké bowl was below average, I know I shouldn't expect a good Poké bowl at an Asian place, but even the ingredients weren't fresh enough.the bubble tea tastes ok.A point that worth mentioning is that the service was very warm and welcoming. Feels like they are a big family.Overall, the experience was good because of the service, ambiance and drink. However, I think this place is kinda overpriced for its food quality. As a restaurant, the owner should put priority on food more than everything else"
/user_details?userid=fw7GQ34xVS3cZpuV5UmMFA,Irene D.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",4 star rating,"After the owner contacted me apologizing for my first experience, I decided to give it another try and I'm happy I did because the second time around was so much better!We were greeted by a very kind and happy server. We were seated and started with drinks and pork belly bao buns as appetizers. The boa bun was good but a bit too bready for me. The pork was seasoned perfectly with a nice kick to it. Definitely a must!My friend had the Curry Udon Noodles with tofu (they also offer it with rice) as his main. It was delicious! The curry was so tasty and the tofu was delicious. Not sure how you can make tofu taste so good, but they made it happen.I had the Karaage chicken and it was served with kimchi and a bowl of rice with an egg. The chicken was crispy, juicy and light, which was a nice change from my first time around. They also offer it as an appetizer, so if you have your eye on another main dish, you can get a taster of the chicken which I suggest you do.We also shared the Salmon Tataki. It was nice and light.For dessert, my friend took the bubble tea ice cream. Now, if you're not a fan of bubble tea, doesn't matter cause you will love this! I'm not even sure how to describe it. It was just really very good and you should have it!For matcha lovers, they have a Matcha Crème Brûlée. I'm not the biggest fan of matcha (don't ask why I ordered this) so my first bite was like ""ouf! That's a lot matcha"" but with every bite I took, it kept getting better and better until I finished it all lolAs I mentioned earlier the service was friendly, and not just to us, but to all tables. The servers would walk around with a big smile on their face. The food was really good and the decor is simple and cute.I'm happy I came back and can't wait to come again!"
/user_details?userid=KQSRUu4Aapl0hG6eu2v8iw,Lizzie S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This place is down some stairs! They can be icy in the snow. I also wish they were more accessible but I digress. Anyways, I came here thrice during a 4-day trip but only ordered things twice because I thought they were closing early before the posted 10:30pm time when they were washing the floor and putting up chairs on tables. When I came in an hour earlier the next night, they were doing the same thing but I was convinced they had to be open. They then told me that the kitchen closes at 9:30pm. Okay. Weird closing rituals aside, Majesthe is a really cute restaurant with boba, desserts, special galaxy lemonade, and meals. It's more of a sit-down place (with free WiFi and a few outlets!) but you can get your drinks to-go. I got the pu'er tea latte and guan yin tea lattes (both with agar boba, which I've heard is the healthier bubble option) and also got the salmon poke bowl and spring flowers dessert to-go for my flight home. Everything was very good and the tea at 25% sweet no ice was perfect! The poke bowl was a bit smaller than I expected but may be by SF standards. I ordered the Spring Flowers dessert because I couldn't get the creme brûlée to go and it was very similar--not burnt custard, but still custard. A must-visit if you're near McGill or Concordia, and downtown in general!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. It was so convenient today, since I am nearby this, and my friends and I are hungry. A cute average size Asian restaurant in our Montreal downtown. I love how this place seems small but pretty spacious, with a nice bar, hanging cocktail glasses over it. Service is friendly, helpful and pretty quick. Our waiter Vincent was sweet and checked on us to make sure that we are enjoying ourselves and that everything is ok.I had a ""Krabby Patty"" Bao, made with fried crab. It was small but it was filling and absolutely delicious. On the side a bubble tea made black tea latte with pearls and non sweet, which was perfect. My friends meals looked also beautiful and delicious. The price is affordable. Definitely a place to try!"
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A beautiful lit resto with a white decor. The resto is in a basement but with the lighting it makes it seem very large. The service was great. Our server checked on us regularly and asked of our opinion despite the restaurant completely packed on a weekday. I went with a couple of coworkers who were just as satisfied with their food. I had the veggie miso pasta which I very much enjoyed. The food was served in a bowl and you'd think it's s small portion but it definitely is not. Alongside I ordered a galaxy drink (because of how it looked). It's a lingonberry based lemonade cold drink. It tastes great, citrusy, sweet (you have a preference of sweetener level). I love that they serve the drink in disposable cups because if you can't finish it, you can walk out with your drink."
/user_details?userid=HC5zLdut4caN1VPqxqRsMw,Lana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Interesting menu for both food and drinks. There were so many drinks I wanted to order, but instead just went for dessert. The pork belly bowl was simple and tasty. It had a few pieces of pork belly, egg, cucumber, and seaweed. It might look small, but it was pretty filling. My friend who had the fried chicken karaage really enjoyed it. The highlight of the meal was absolutely the bubble tea ice cream. This was probably the best dessert I've had this year so far. The ice cream itself had that classic, addicting milk tea flavor. On the side were tapioca balls (which were perfect) and fruit (mostly berries). Really refreshing and overall amazing dessert (5/5).

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I like this spot! The food is solid quality. Feels like Asian bar food (mostly Korean, but with clear fusion notes - e.g., Bao buns). You can get alcohol - but also bubble tea. The latter is nice for letting NYC in a hot summer day.Service is ok - not great. Only reason for 4 star review.Pricing is very, very fair. Not cheap but super affordable - even for students actually.Venue is design-ish and clean. Pleasant place to hang out for a bit."

Surprisingly,the dessert was my favourite part. That panda cotta has this chewing texture. The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual. It reminds me of Opiano whereas lots students come for a casual meal with friends.This is a place that I would go to have a simple meal with my friends."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Camr back after they moved. They have new items on the menu. We tried the karaage, krabby patty bao, pork rice, curry omurice, black sesame creme brulee and a tieguanying latte. The karaage was delicious and had a special taste vs the normal ones. The latte was amazing and had a very nice tea aroma. The creme brulee was quite special but didn't have much black sesame taste. The other 3 dishes weren't very impressive and were a bit too salty for us. I cringed a little while eating the soft shell crab bao. I thought they would cut the crab in pieces but it came as a whole crab inside the bao and it felt like there was a huge red spider in it. The staff were very nice and friendly and the service was quite fast. The place feels much bigger than the old one. Would definitely come back for the karaage and the tea."
/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"(4.5 rounding it to 5)I was here during their soft opening of the bar downstairs from Majesthé. Since it's the soft opening they had a more limited menu of drinks and food. I got one of their signature cocktails (lavendary), three cup chicken rice bowl, a long island iced tea, and their homemade Irish cream shot (complementary during their soft opening if you follow them on Instagram) to top it all off. Starting off with their lavendary cocktail drink, I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. I'm think I'm fairly experimental when it comes to cocktails but I feel like I have my reservations when it comes to cocktails that are more floral based. Lavender tops my list for being a bit pungent and I didn't want to feel like I'm hit in the face with lavender essential oils. However, this was recommended as their most popular drink so I gave it a shot, and I'm really glad I did. It's more complex than I expected. The top notes give you a tea fragrance, then you get a light and refreshing drink with the tiniest hint of lavender that ends of with a bit of a kick. The long island iced tea was alright but I feel it could use a bit more citrus. Their complementary shot is a great dessert shooter to end off a meal. It taste liked coffee liqueur but better. Food wise, the three cup chicken rice bowl was flavourful and very Instagram friendly. It's not a big portion though so I wouldn't expect to be full from it. I think this place is definitely more of a bar with a snack menu, but since they have a restaurant upstairs I think it's convenient to grab dinner upstairs and then come downstairs for drinks and a change of scenery.The downstairs bar is newly renovated so it's really clean. It's not super loud and the lighting and bar area is very modern and sleek. You do get your wooden accents in the seating region with a good variety of more intimate areas as well as seating for larger groups. Service wise, I think you get attention when you want it and need it, and everyone was very chilled and friendly.Overall I think if you're looking for some place that's a bit more innovative with cocktails, this is great option. I can see this being a good 5 à 7 place and I'm excited to see how it'll turn out to be for their grand opening."

It was sweet. Like if I was eating 2 sugars cube, not 1 but 2. I dont know what they put in their batter, but I can tell you there's a lot of sugar. It tasted nothing like chicken. The first bite is tolerable, but afterwards, it just make you nauseous. And let's not get into the texture of the chicken...there was some weird jelly-like thing inside when you ""open"" your piece of chicken.For my drink, asked for no ice and aloes vera. Had a lot of ice and lychee jelly instead."

We arrived around 17h30 so there weren't a lot of people. I ordered the Secret Garden and milk tea and my friend had the braised pork. The service was amazing. They were quick and the servers were very nice. Everything was also very aesthetically pleasing. The Secret Garden was beautifully and a light tasty dessert on a hot summer day. My friend's meal was delicious and very tasty. We stayed to talk for a while and it was a very pleasant time! When you stay to talk in some places it might feel like you're getting pressured to leave but I didn't feel that here. Looking forward to going back!---------------J'y suis allée après le travail pour me gâter avec une de mes amies un vendredi. On y était à 17h30 donc il n'y avait pas beaucoup de personnes. Nous avons commandé le jardin secret, le thé au lait et le porc braisé. Le service était fantastique. Les serveurs étaient rapides et très gentils! Tout était aussi très satisfaisant à regarder. Le jardin secret était très jolie et un bon dessert léger et savoureux pour une journée chaude d'été. Le repas de mon amie était aussi délicieux. Nous sommes restées un peu pour parler et c'était très plaisant. À quelques endroits ont peu se sentir pressé de sortir, mais les serveurs étaient agréables et nous nous sentions à l'aise et relaxée.

I got the honey braided pork bowl with ground pork and it was delicious. The spiced mayo they had on top was delicious and all of the flavors went so well together with the egg mixed in. My partner got the pork belly bowl and I think mine was a tad better, but hers was good as well. We also got the iced toasted oolong milk tea with almond milk and agar pearls  and the blueberry green iced tea with lychee. Both were delicious. The blueberry green was much more floral while the toasted oolong resembled a iced black tea with milk. Would definitely come back here again!"

/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Their foods are really healthy, they stay away from fried stuff. Most of the stuff are steam, boiled, bake and at the most pan-fried (dumplings). Food quality is okay, since it's healthy, you can't expect much on the flavour side. What's healthy is really hard to be tasty. It's just standard rules. Drink wise, we ordered their fancy lemonade. Galaxy Lemonade... Pretty.. But that's it. Overall is good.

Tapioca pearls are only $0.50 extra.  We asked for sugar on the side so we could adjust to taste ourselves. I ordered the Taiwanese sausages and they were quite filling, affordable and very satisfying. Taiwanese sausages tend to be garlicky and slightly sweet tasting and when paired with scallions, spicy mayo, slivers of nori, paper thin radish slices and popped rice bits, it took satisfying to another level!  This is a great afternoon snack if you're looking for something savoury.  The staff is very pleasant and courteous."

It's definitely a very nice place to have lunch and I definitely recommend trying this place out! Service is a little slow but the staff are super friendly.

The pork belly is fatty and melts in your mouth, and the tomato and cheese of the risotto with the squash is perfect, an amazing experience.

They pay lots of attention to their food, from flavours to plating. The menu is small, and every component is described. They use sous vide to cook some of their items like the egg and chicken breast, so definitely innovative!Highly recommend the braised pork rice, was a little too soggy the second time around. They also have special menu items like the pork bun that came out recently, which I found better than most restaurants that serve the Asian fusion style of steamed buns. (See photo)The bubble tea was standard, but not bad nonetheless. The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, feels open even in the small restaurant."

But I won't hold it against them bc I saw how busy they were.  I guess some staff called in sick bc the person that took my order isn't normally a waiter.Karaage chicken bowl - a must. Really generous with their portions. Love the piled high, huge pieces of crispity crunchy chicken but would have appreciated a knife at times. I was alone but if you were on a date, I don't know if you'd want to show your savage animal side by tearing into some meat with your teeth.  Maybe you do.Beet fries - lightly battered and fried everything is always on the top of my list.Matcha Oolong bubble tea - they are serious about their boba tea here.  Cold but no ice and they fill it to the top of a liter sized beer mug. WTH???  Pass the 40.So many other fantastic things on the menu. I couldn't decide. Will have to return for the baos."
/user_details?userid=w2c6Xzt-0ZKMDJ7DYsm9PQ,Elaine L.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"For appetizers, we ordered the Fried Chicken Karaage ($6.50) and the ""Krabby Patty"" Bao ($7.50). The Fried Chicken Karaage did not disappoint! It was full of meat, and was coated in a flavourful and juicy batter. The Krabby Patty Bao was also a hit for me! Even though I found the sauce a little spicy, it really added to the bao, and I loved how crunchy the crab was, and how all the ingredients within the bao tied so well together.For our main dishes, we got the Candied Bacon Pasta ($12.50), the Traditional Pork Rice ($10), Salmon Fried RIce ($13), and the Pork Belly Rice ($11). All of them smelled delicious, looked amazing, and except for the Candied Bacon Pasta, were all WAY too salty for our liking. We were not even able to get past 10 bites with the Traditional Pork Rice. The Candied Bacon Pasta was very bland and it really felt like they forgot to add salt into that dish whereas all the other dishes felt like they dumped a whole box of salt in it. It was very peculiar to me that 3 dishes were extremely salty, and there was just one dish that was very bland. I was honestly quite disappointed with the main dishes, especially when the appetizers had been so delicious."

Service was on the slower side, but this is definitely a nice place to chill and eat with friends. Really popular with young Asian students.The pork belly bowl was amazing - melt in your mouth with all those delicious juices soaking into the rice. The traditional pork bowl was like lu rou Fan for you Taiwanese people out there. And it tasted pretty authentic! We also got the omurice, which was equally delicious.A heads up on the rice dishes, there is a lot of rice and not enough of the meat! Perhaps that's my only complaint cause the pork belly was just so good.Anyways, we also got the summer is coming alcoholic drink - it's yogurt, green tea, rum, and lychee jelly. Super yummy! You can't taste the alcohol at all. Also ordered the winter melon latte and that was sososo creamy. The aloe jelly we added was bomb. They don't carry their hot drink machine right now at their new location though. Just an FYI.A great place to relax with friends and eat yummy food! Note that the sign to get in is just the crown. You have to walk down stairs to get to the door."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I went here for a early lunch. This place isn't hard to find but they don't own a sign. Hanging a sign probably help the business. It is not a busy place for lunch so I would recommend people working in the nearby buildings to have lunch here since the service is fast and neat. They do have a relatively small menu. The price is inexpensive compared to the nearby underground food court which is so crowded during lunch time.I had a pork rice. It comes with minced pork, floss, slow cooked egg and dry seaweed. The seaweed really lights up the meal. I didn't finish it because it came with too much rice. After I finished the toppings, only plain rice left. The slow cooked egg is also rare to see in an inexpensive restaurant. I can see their effort to provide people high quality dishes, but overall the rice is too dull for me.I did add some spicy sauce in it.My friend had the first pasta with butternut squash. She liked it very much. The portion is just perfect. The sauce is full of flavor. I liked the pasta over my rice.The tea latte was wonderful. i had a winter melon tea latte. Winter melon tea is a Taiwan traditional drink. Whenever I spotted it, I can't resist. It reminds me of the good old times. Give it a try if you like Asian food. Be assured it is good and mild.Will bring my other friends to come and try other dishes."

It did not disappoint.I would describe the food as Western brunch with an Eastern twist. I had the Eggs Benedict $9.99 and my husband had the Quinoa Salad $5.99.My Eggs Benedict was poached eggs on an English muffin with bacon, Chinese sausage (lap xuong), radishes, and green onions, covered in Hollandaise sauce. The eggs were perfectly poached with runny yolks. My complaint with the bacon is that it was really fatty (like fattier than most bacon that I've had). The English muffin was perfectly toasted. The Hollandaise sauce was ok, I've had better, but it wasn't bad. I loved the sweetness of the lap xuong and I liked the east meets west fusion flavours.I had a taste of my husband's quinoa salad and it was great. I loved the dressing, which was a Miso and rice vinegar dressing. It had puffed rice and crunchy kale chips sprinkled on top which added nice texture (I'm all about the different textures when it comes to salads). It also had cabbage, grape tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers, and of course, quinoa. It was great, I wished I had ordered it. Service was nice and attentive for a café. The server refilled our waters when we were running low. The place is cute. It's a bit small and seats maximum 30, most of which are along the bar.There is no sign on the storefront to tell you the name of the place. The existing sign (at the time of the writing of this review) is a blacked out Sushi Shop sign (!). Come on guys, get a real sign!  Overall, a really cute place for brunch/lunch."

It was quiet for lunch time, so we were seated right away. Service was fairly quick also. As the name implies, this place is more focused on drinks more than anything else. Unfortunately, I was short of change and being more hungry than thirsty, I opted for a meal instead than a drink. The price was fair for the amount of food we received. The flavors themselves, however, were not diverse enough and kinda bland at times. But the flavors present were enough to leave me with a good impression overall.

This Taiwanese fusion place is a little gem of a restaurant that honestly deserves so much more recognition. Though it's already relatively well known and quite busy around meal times, the staff keep their service top quality. Food can be ready in 10 minutes if you know what you want to order - and we always do - and once they've even been kind enough to help us get us in and out the door in 20 minutes when we were in a rush. I always see the same few staff, and I have never had any problems here. As for food, it's already rare enough to find somewhere that serves both heathly and delicious meals; at Masjesthé, they've somehow manage to make them well-priced as well. We always order the pork belly rice, which is super flavourful, and the veggies always have something special about them that's hard to recreate at home. I usually don't usually drink sweet teas, but when I choose to get one here, it's been good every time. The portions are good and leave you comfortably full. Masjesthé has without doubt secured itself in my list of restaurants that keep me coming back again and again (and again). P.S. for McGill students - they take the MCSS discount card for 10% off!"

The pork belly bao was a-ok. The bun was a touch harder/less fluffy than their competitors, but the pork was tender and tasted good. The latte was just fine.The miso was an enormous letdown, and I should have known because I was told so by a colleague who brought all his friends here one night - great prices, nice presentation, decent appetizers, awful mains.I could have sworn the pasta order they gave me was creamy mushroom instead of brown butter miso. It was creamy (and slightly clotted), with mushroom slices throughout. It was also extremely bland. I can't emphasize how bland it was. There was no flavour to it at all, let alone the distinct flavours of brown butter and miso. I asked about it and the servers insisted it was the right dish, which leads me to conclude that it's just not good, as opposed to a mistake. I took two bites and didn't have any more - and I normally hate wasting food.When my bill came, they didn't bat an eye at my virtually untouched pasta. After I paid - and I was charged full price - they offered to switch my main to something else to see if I'd like it better, and I decided not to. It was cold and rainy and I just wanted something reliably good. I ended up getting some fish tacos to go from La Habanera. I will not be returning."

It all kind of felt like a uni student had made what they thought was a good dish and then served it to you.Service was friendly though and they gave out some latte samples while we were there which were quite good (matcha-flavored I believe), so who knows, maybe the good reviews are based on those elements.

Visited new location today!!I wish all the other problems I had at the old location were resolved at the new place, but it was still the old ones, plus more. I've always had an issue with their consistency - eg. the braised pork rice was on point for me once, other times there's been issues with the ratio of rice and pork and sauce, and spicy-ness of the mayo. Sometimes food is quite good, other times not so much. Everyone has already commented on service at the new location; I'm sure it's going to improve with time. Also the beet fries really need a dipping sauce, i know it's coming soon but the poor beets on their own with the cornstarch coating is just sooo bland. The bao in the tofu bao was too sweet and too airy- would've preferred a more substantial/dense bao. On a side note about the new decor, not too sure who they collaborated with but there's an atmosphere of not-quite-there bougie-chic. Feels like they were going for a clean upscale French bistro vibe, but the space is missing its old charm and French charm. Maybe different lighting would help, the white interior pairs with white lights just is too sterile for a semi basement. Anyway it really sucks that I've had good experiences in the past. Now every time I go I have high hopes, only to find them not realized. Makes me wish I only had mediocre expectations to start with so I wouldn't be as disappointed at the end of my meal. Five stars for location though. It's even closer to McGill students now that it's on Robert Bourassa."

From a personal standpoint, certain staples I liked are missing from the new menu. More objectively, in my most recent visit, the chicken kimchi bao was short on both chicken and kimchi, and quite heavy on mayonnaise and barbecue sauce. My quinoa salad was so overdressed that it resembled porridge. I struggled to finish it. Two stars at best.Service was scattered and unprofessional. It took 35 minutes to receive a salad and bao--for carry out. In the waiting period, customers were scarcely acknowledged, and two left after they were seated but had not been able to order. Dirty dishes remained on tables without being bussed or wiped. There was no organization in table numbering or server zoning, and many dishes came from the kitchen and servers had to ask patrons at each table if they had ordered it or not. The two servers were not proactive, attentive, and were occasionally dismissive to the patrons. One star, perhaps none.Customers visit a restaurant for the food and drink; they return based on their experience with the product and service. If this were my first experience, I would not return.

Scroll down, and look at that bowl of braised pork rice, and scroll back up. Yup, that's right, it looks delicious, doesn't it? I don't use this line often, but it actually tastes better than it looks. I know I cultivate a non-bs attitude, but I want to make my description as graphic as possible here. Please excuse the use of some flowery poetry in my description.As you begin to mix your rice with your chopsticks, magic happens. That warm runny yolk oozes like liquid gold, onto a bed of short grain rice, which does a terrific job of soaking up all the juices from the braised pork. Are you ready for the explosion of umami? I sure wasn't. On the other hand, I wasn't a big fan of the winter melon bubble tea. The sweetness was overbearing, and something about it tasted artificial. I do have to point out that the waitresses suggested not going for any added sugar, as the drink was sweet enough by itself. I regretted my #challenge accepted"" mentality."

/user_details?userid=2Cc7dUXIi1NlfbGR1WXUug,Henry L.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"This place provides a twist on familiar comfort foods. While there is heavy Taiwanese, Italian, and French influences, the mood of the place largely feels like a bright and airy bubble tea shop, with a college hangout vibe. Their creative menu offers a hearty meal at affordable prices and it feels like a comfortable a place you can linger to enjoy their delicious creamy lattes. The food was also plated beautifully, which was a pleasant surprise for a place with a casual vibe.Among their entrees, we tried the butternut avec carbonara and the braised pork with rice. We also had the Earl Grey and matcha tea lattes. We really enjoyed the butternut avec Carbonara. It featured a creamy but light butternut squash purée, peas, mascarnpone, pancetta, and unexpectedly, Chinese sausage. It was garnished with green onion and slices of radish. We were not sure how the Italian and Chinese influences would play together, but the flavors blended well. The braised pork with rice had ground bits of marinated pork, shredded dried pork (it's a Chinese thing), and a seven-spice mayonnaise. It was topped with a poached egg that you break and mix in, like a bibimbap but instead as a fried rice. The flavor was delicious, sweet mellow blend of soy sauce and sake. We had hoped the dish would have more vegetables to provide some contrast and additional texture. At the time of this review, it is the only rice dish they feature, so if you're in the mood for that, (or looking for something gluten free), it's a filling and satisfying choice.The teas were some of our favorite lattes experience so far in Montreal. (We we were visiting from NYC.) They seem to put a lot of thought into their drinks. First of all, their lattes are made with a base of brewed tea,  not some syrup or powder mix. The matcha latte is made with Japanese matcha and brewed Chinese tea. The Earl Grey has a wonderfully balanced richness and fragrance of bergamot, black tea, milk and sugar. Speaking of sugar, they offer different levels of sweetness options, which is a revelation. I find most cafe drinks way too sweet and candy-like, and the Le Majesthe lattes were perfect."

However, some of the dishes are nothing special (like the ramen or the tofu bao). A few plates also seem overpriced, like the bubbletea ice-cream and the extra portions that come with some of the dishes. The non-alcoholic drinks come in a very large size, so it's worth the price. I've tried the lingonberry galaxy and the matcha/oolong latte. The drinks aren't too sweet if you choose the right amount of sugar, which is great. The service was pretty good. Because they've just reopened, most of the servers are still unfamiliar with the program they're using. But they're all very understanding and nice, so I'm sure it'll get better."

The service was very friendly and the ambience was causal and relaxed. We had to get our order in quickly since the kitchen closed at 9. Initially, I was impressed with how quickly the dishes came out but for some reason, it slowed down when it came to the last couple dishes, so a couple people in our group had to wait a long time for their meals (something about the fryer?). Anyway, the food was good overall - a little something to appeal to a everyone. Would be nice to have a couple more vegetarian options on the menu."

One of the best pork belly boa (appetizer) ever! So generous in portion and quality filling nags and meat.  Their signature rice dish with minced pork was satisfying hit too! Tasty and beautifully presented with wooden bowl... size looked ok but actually a generous portion too! Was so full after!

I wasn't originally very keen to try the place but my roommate brought me and I'm glad she did - the salmon poke was one of the best I've ever tasted. Their desserts are amazing, but portions are pretty small for the price, so if you're someone with a sweet tooth, you might want to save yourself some $$$ and go somewhere else (or pick up a pint at a dep). A fair warning for vegetarians - the menu isn't very veggie friendly, unless you want to end up eating appetizers only for a meal. Otherwise, a cool place!"

Let us modify the dishes to our liking. The food came out fast and was good.Now the bad part. We had our baby with us and their high chair was broken. They only had one...we wanted a tomato or piece of fruit to feed our baby. The white server came up to us and we asked her for a piece of fruit or vegetable and before we could finish our sentence she immediately said no. We asked again to make sure she understood as her English was poor. Again a blunt no. Our food came out with a tomato...And then the table across from us had dessert brought out with fresh strawberries...If it wasn't for Asian server I would have left no tip...if I were management I would fire the white server on the spot for pure rudeness and lack of initiative to go above and beyond for customers..."

There are a lot of boba tea places in the US and Canada, but they don't usually make everything fresh and so well.

My favorite drink though is the yogurt green tea drink - it tastes like a combination of the yakult yogurt drink and green tea, and it's super refreshing and delicious !!!  Food wise, I tried their brown butter miso pasta, which is super tasty! Presentation is beautiful (for all you instagrammers), and the flavors blend together so well. You can tell the chefs put a lot of thought and effort behind their dishes.

/user_details?userid=F0DhlPxM2kH9IZPdgmWp1g,Ryan K.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"While my friends and I spent the weekend in Montreal, we were really craving bubble tea and couldn't really find too many places in Montreal, until we came across Le MajesThe. To start off, the place was really cute and had a modern feel to it. The people who worked there were super friendly as well! My friends and I are always amazed when we see an Asian person speaking French so that was quite awesome as well haha. Anyways, let's get talking about the food! So we ordered the creamy mushroom pasta, carbonara with butternut squash, and liquid nitrogen earl grey ice cream. The creamy mushroom pasta was alright, the sauce was nice and creamy, but it lacked in flavour. I didn't try the carbonara with butternut squash, but my friend said it was plain/bland. Now I was extremely excited for the liquid nitrogen earl grey ice cream, but it was quite disappointing.. With liquid nitrogen ice cream, normally it comes out smoking, but not at Le MajesThe. The earl grey ice cream tasted really good, but just lacked that excitement of the liquid nitrogen smoke. In terms of the bubble tea, it was average compared to what I'm used to in Toronto. There wasn't much variety, but I will say that it came in cute mason jar cups. Overall, I'm not sure if there are better places to get bubble tea and food than here, but if there isn't, I would definitely check out this place. I kind of wish I had more time in Montreal as I would've liked to experienced more, but until next time Montreal."

In my first visit, I ordered a veggie miso pasta and in the bowl, there's literally ONLY pasta and the sauce; no other ingredients! With this prices, I would expect some veggies in it or more toppings. Few days after my first visit, I went there to have a take up drink. Their waitress doesn't know what they were doing AT ALL. I asked for a yogurt green tea, no ice and half sugar with bubbles. The waitress asked: ""so you want it hot?""   I really wanted ask her if she can a drink with yogurt in it hot.. and when I got my drink, there's no bubbles in it... So they took my drink and added the bubbles Today, I went with a friend and we both ordered the veggie squash pasta. When we got the pasta, halfway through our convo, we found out that there was bacon in it!!  we double check with the waitress and she thought we ordered the regular one when I initially specified that we wanted the vegetarian options..I give it 2 starts just because that I can't deny that their drinks are decent within the reasonable prices,  it is also made up from the real tea not powder.

Many staff are new so I even know their menus better than them which is ridiculous. Let's talk about food. Ordered a milk tea with bubble, comes without bubble and no explanation. When I asked my waitress when I'm ready to pay I overheard them saying there's no more bubbles left. Should I not be notified? The pastas, omg. I've had this particular pasta dozens of times before the restaurant moved, and since it's reopening I've ordered it for FIVE different time and EACH AND EVERY time it tasted different! Sometimes too milky, sometimes too bland, and sometimes full of spices that is basically inedible. Sometimes it comes with parmesan and sometimes not. And two or three times out of five have I noticed a burnt taste. Tried their curries for two times, one comes with a plate with oil floating on top and another time way too spicy.

Simply delicious. I would try everything on the menu. Excellent staff as well, one gentleman walked me through the chef's process and the nuances of each of the noodle dishes. Great food, highly recommended."

My neices loved the Galaxy Lemonade (changes color).. we enjoyed the eggs benny and pastas.. the Earl Grey Latte was a bit heavy handed on the lavender. Too bad we were too full for dessert..looked good too! :)

Unlike any pork bun I have had - truly delicious and memorable. They have managed successfully to fuse Asian with American style food. Ultimate freshness and quality at an amazing price, truly I would have paid double for the pork bun. My friend had the crispy salmon salad which was cooked to perfection sitting on a swish of puréed beet which tasted fresher than fresh. The chef has to be applauded for his/her plating and whimsical presentation."
