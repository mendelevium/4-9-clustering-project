Came during covid but they have a huge outdoor space within their walls. Food was expensive, but makes sense for this venue. Mushroom crepe i got was not all that, just normal, so the high price was not justified."
/user_details?userid=z3woVwDJYjlap8DJw6tGig,Lauryn W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love bringing out of town guests to Jardin Nelson during late Spring and throughout the entire Summer!  The outside garden is one of the best in the city!  Even if it's raining or a little chilly outside, they have you covered (literally) with the coolest reversed umbrellas and heat lamps.  The live jazz adds to the special ambiance!If you're a fan of French Onion Soup...then you must have a bowl at Jardin Nelson!  It is fantastic!  Other dishes that friends and family love are:  Strawberry Maple salad, Eggplant Parm, and the baby back ribs!Jardin Nelson is located in the heart of Old Montreal.  So either before or after your meal you can walk around amongst local vendors, pop into stores along the route.  Also, close to the water, so you're just a few minutes away from the giant Ferris wheel!"
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",4 star rating,"Heavy rain didn't stop Jardin Nelson from offering outdoor seating and live music under a huge canopy in one area and clear plastic ceiling in another- to protect folks from Mother Nature on our first 2016 long weekend Montréal trip. The outdoor terrace has different nooks- so depending where you're sitting, you'll get a different angle of the stage. We were slightly elevated and didn't mind that we weren't that close to the stage anyway. Despite its Old Montréal location, Jardin Nelson wasn't drowning with elbow-to-elbow tourists. To be honest, I was actually into Jardin's charming terrace more than anything. Service was pleasant and after driving 6 hours from NY, Jardin's lunch was good."

/user_details?userid=97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ,Rebecca C.,"Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"Come for the ambience and the music, and don't come here for the food. I got here around 3:30 p.m. when a live jazz band was playing on a Monday. But unfortunately they wrapped up within minutes of me arriving. So don't come here between 3:30 p.m. and 7 p.m, during the dead period, when there is a break from the live jazz band.The garden courtyard is super cute with flower arrangements throughout the restaurant and sunny in decor.The food was very mediocre - borderline inedible. so I would recommend to stick with the french stables versus what I did. I ordered Le potage du jour, which is a Mexican soup with radish, hominy, and chicken. It was too sour, with too much lemon juice in the soup. Upon the recommendation of the waitress, I tried the crab cake with a side of salad. The crab cake lacked structure and was really mushy inside. The accompanying salad had fresh fruit but the salad leaves were bland and yellow around the edges.Also I had the lemonade with basil and it was too sweet. If I were to come back, I would probably stick to drinks or tried and true dishes like french onion soup or burger and fries."

Wish I paid attention to other Yelpers who were right to say that Montreal has too many amazing culinary delights to waste your calories on a mediocre meal at Jardin Nelson.Let's start with the fun part--the live wait. There is ALWAYS a loooong line stretching halfway across the block. Expect to spend at least an hour. We waited around an hour and a half on a blisteringly hot Sunday afternoon. No shade to hide in. Grueling.The place is always packed, so expect suuuuper slow service. This was our last meal on our Montreal trip, so definitely spoiled the concluding impression. We were waiting on our waitress for half an hour each time we needed water, condiments, dessert, or check. Seriously super slow and bad service. Way understaffed. Need more people to man the quantity of guests. Wasted over three hours on a meal that shouldn't have taken more than an hour. Inside is pretty, but too casual and not pretty enough that would justify waiting for two hours in the scorching sun.Now to the food. Agree with other Yelpers who questioned if this place is known for crepes, shouldn't they be good. We ordered mushroom and saddle of rabbit. What a disappointment. I love crepes, cheese, mushrooms, and rabbit, so I was seriously blown away by how bad our dishes were. Completely bland and tasteless. I literally did not taste anything--just bland cheese and mushrooms and some stale meat. The crepe was like cardboard--completely tasteless.The spare ribs were good--falling off the bone. But the sweet sauce was too obviously chemically sweet and cheap tasting, so I was not a fan.The best part of our miserable meal was the dessert. We got Montreal's favorite pudding. Have to admit--that was solid. The simple cake was baked and drenched in super sweet maple syrup. What joy to eat hot caramel and cake with cold ice cream. Wish the portion of ice cream was bigger and more proportional to the portion of the cake. I'm a total sugarholic and can handle any amount of sugar. But please listen to my advice--share that portion. It might seem small, but you won't be able to get through it yourself. I felt a crazy sugar rush after a few first bites and by the time I got halfway, I was already crushing from an overwhelming amount of sweetness. It is sooo good, but definitely diabetes on a plate. Share that sumptuous goodness and your health and taste buds will thank you.The only saving grace of this establishment is of course the live 24/7 jazz music. We sat right next to the band and the singer and enjoyed classic hits like My Heart Will Go On, Hit the Road Jack, My Favorite Things, etc. Very soothing. Guess everyone thinks the same if the crowds are always busting the doors. Overall, this is not a place for impatient food lovers. Good to hang out and enjoy the music with some drinks, but not for a meal."
/user_details?userid=DahNPktmkpkS8sP8c4Pohw,Nathan D.,"Evanston, IL",5 star rating,"Furngully | Friendly | intimate Furngully: Overall the entire restaurant is extremely green. They have various levels and the combination reminded me of the animated movie Furngully from my childhood. It's all out doors but the various levels protects you from the rain. We know this because about 20-30 minutes of our brunch was during a torrencial downpour. But, we were all good and just waited it out with more wine. Friendly: The entire staff was extremely accommodating to our rowdy crew. We were 14 guys on a bachelor party trip but the staff was quick, courteous (even to 'THAT GUY') and provided great recommendations. Intimate: The rooftop terrace provides an intimate atmosphere. Even though it's a completely outdoors and the tables at first glance appear pretty close, you can have a conversation and not be involved in other's conversation. At the same time you know you are in a busy spot. Literally there was never an open table in the Resturant for the 2.5 hours we were there. Pro tip: go during the week Monday - Friday and make a reservation at 11:30 or 12. That place gets packed quickly because it's in a prime spot of town. The weekends doesn't take reservation and it's really hard to get in. Pro tip: get the chicken dish with various combinations of fruits/vegetables (I forgot the name). But it was the first ever colder chicken dish, I truly enjoyed and would not hesitate to get again."

Long wait times, slow service & mediocre food.Came here for dinner after reading the rave reviews.... what a disappointment. Our food included:Fried calamari: soggyPiri piri chicken crepe... meh.

/user_details?userid=lEcfvjwB93q_MPxqT2iiyA,Lesley M.,"La Mesa, CA",4 star rating,"I this was one of the few places we ate out at since we spent so much time at night in our hotel room, ordering in. The service was really friendly and professional. I was mostly impressed by the views, we dined outside and it was really lovely. The exterior of the building and the patio and courtyard are all really charming. I had the Pate chinois au canard, the duck confit was delicious. It was paired with a corn duo and mashed potatoes and served with beets and a fruit ketchup that I did not try as I'm not a big ketchup fan. We also shared the maple ice cream cup, which I liked and only had a couple bites of as I was really full at that point. It was a nice dessert choice as it wasn't as rich as my meal. I had to laugh at my dining companion's attempt at  making conversation in French, his Irish accent is pretty thick and he sounds a bit comical to me, but the people here were really nice."
/user_details?userid=b9Q74D4XvFjJHKvLBLSaEA,Shannon W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5 star rating,"I absolutely love this place and think it's a must do when traveling to Montreal, especially if the weather is nice. First off, how does one pass up sitting outside, listening to live jazz, and drinking a freshly squeezed (OJ) mimosa? It's quite delightful. The place is huge, with a large outdoor area on the first floor, as well as an indoor area and a front patio area, then there's also an upstairs with indoor and outdoor seating. Yes, it's a bit touristy, but I gather locals go here too. I know I sure would. The jazz was really good, very relaxing overall, I felt like I could have easily stayed all day. The mimosas were an excellent start to my Saturday. I wish they were a bit stronger, but the fresh OJ was clutch. For brunch we ordered the poached duck egg and the open-faced grilled cheese sandwich. I thought both were excellent. The grilled cheese tasted a bit like dessert with the blue cheese, dates, and a dash of maple syrup. Yum. Overall, they have a super extensive menu with tons of great options. There's a separate menu for brunch, with very reasonable pricing and the regular menu for lunch/dinner. Tons of drink options too. I'm very glad we got the chance to check this place out! Service was very good too!"
/user_details?userid=vxRgc6S1mgXbZGXOE5nylQ,Nish K.,"Atlanta, GA",1 star rating,"Yelp let me down. This is a tourist trap with over priced and very mediocre food IMO.Based on the reviews and location decided to come here on a Friday evening (our last evening in Montreal) and the front of the house guided us to the back of the house to be seated. With a line of over 20 people, we got seated in about 15 mins (not bad) but this place is hugeeeee.After we were seated, it was a good 20 mins before we got our water. Being over-zealous we ordered the calamari, peri peri chicken crepe and the charcuterie pizza. Since I wanted to have a sangria, the only one they offer in a glass was $13.50 vs. a half pitcher for $18.50. I decided to pick the half pitcher of the Lychee sangria. Service was slow and inattentive. 10 mins for the sangria to come, and another 20 mins for the food. Luckily we were seated next to the Jazz band, who were entertaining - frankly the only saving grace.Sangria was ok - a little watered down and very sweet. The peri peri chicken crepe was flavorful but ended up being mushy towards the center, and felt like a quesadilla to me. The pizza was a little more than a personal pizza size with a lot of meat but it was burnt all over. It felt like it sat in the oven a few minutes too long. And I forgot the calamari - a little too much batter and fried too long. I couldn't tell if they were onion rings or calamari frankly. Maybe my taste buds were messed up.This was a wrong choice in my overall wonderful culinary experience in Montreal."

When exploring Old Montreal it's really easy to get sucked into all the tourist traps that line every street corner, but Jardin Nelson was no tourist trap! The ambiance was amazing. When I went there was live music playing, and the band and the singer were absolutely divine. The outside garden is beautiful and the music made it all that much more magical. The food was a good price, and everything we got was a generous portion and also super delicious. I got a pizza chocked full of pepperonis and meats. The sauce was rich and flavorful and the crust was crispy and bready. The lasagna was also rich and delicious!"
/user_details?userid=EfCuN2O6LHmxUleYT1_JeQ,Vijay S.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"We came here for lunch while walking in the Old port area. There were so many restaurants to choose from and decided to go with Jardin Nelson.The place looks small from outside but once you go inside there's a lot of space. They had live French jazz music going on when we walked in. We got seats pretty quick. We ordered the small red sangria along with the tex mex pizza and ceviche. The sangria was good and refreshing and plenty for 2 people. It wasnt sweet which was good as well.The ceviche was small and rather unremarkable. The tex mex pizza was good, somewhat spicy. Overall good experience. Would recommend coming here for the ambiance, drinks and live music."
/user_details?userid=GDHw91B13O54agHBM4Ng0w,Sam M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The ambiance can simply not be beat here. In my opinion it is worth waiting in line for, and I love that they also do not try to force you to leave when you are finished eating. The food is a little bit overpriced but it is still very fresh and tasty. Considering you are also getting entertainment included I would pay the slightly higher price for sure. The service is outstanding. When seated we noticed another table that looked available that had a better view of the band. We asked our server if we could move there, even though we had already ordered drinks and he said no problem and helped us move everything over. So accommodating and helpful, very deserving of a 5 star review."
/user_details?userid=v0EpMF9gSH31Brr3PXpVcg,Puja L.,"Rockville, MD",4 star rating,"I know no one NEEDS my recommendation to visit Jardin Nelson, it has quite a reputation on its own. But, here's my 2 cents -I first visited here when we met a Montreal-resident for lunch. Clearly this is one of the 'places to eat' in Montreal. Two years later when we returned to the city, all I wanted to do was come back here!The restaurant is, of course, beautiful. The flowers adorn all parts of the restaurant and it's the kind of place you want to just sit and chill, especially when they have jazz. We are very much the eat-and-run kind of couple, but we easily spent a couple of hours here. And that's not because of long waits or slow service, we actually were seated and fed within an hour of joining the line. The main draw for me was the pouding chomeur. It's the only place I've ever had it and I fell in love. But everything else we ate was delicious too - the server suggested the seafood crepe and lobster salad, both things we would never have chosen on our own but thoroughly enjoyed. The cheese plate was also surprisingly good - it had just the right amount of cheese and the blue was especially yummy. What a lovely way to enjoy Montreal summer"

Food is standard brunch food, but I think ppl come for the live jazz on a weekend morning. Sometimes you get a good crowd that interacts with the musicians, sometimes people are just focused on their meal :)"

I have been here on most of my visits to Montreal, when I'm visiting in season. I like the vibe--sitting outside with live jazz and munching on crepes. I tend to come at off hours, so I've not had to wait, but if you're coming at prime time, be prepared to stand in line. Service is friendly and attentive, but don't expect a whole lot of detail on the menu--they recommend the same dishes almost every time. I like the chicken liver pate and the seafood crepe. My son ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which was surprisingly heavy with lobster. I usually skip dessert and wander around to another restaurant for that, as their dessert options are too maple-y for me. A nice, classically Old Montreal experience."

Went here on a very quick hour-long lunch during a walking tour break, so we were rushed. No worry, we ordered right away; drinks and apps. The bruschetta was a bunch of almost looking garlic bread and you scoop your own tomato mix. I thought it was alright, my gf loved it. Also got fish tacos which I'm always picky about. They were good, had a different texture which I liked but not insane. The 4/5 comes from the atmosphere and serving. Next time in MTL I will go back and spend a real meal there and I have no doubt it would be amazing!"
/user_details?userid=eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ,Donald S.,"Boca Raton, FL",4 star rating,"Simplement magnifique! Sorry, not many occasions where I get to whip out the French. This is certainly one, and then some! Normally I would say avoid any restaurant located in a cities most touristy area. Tourist traps are very much real. Not to mention the fact that the menu seems to cater to pretty much...everyone. That's normally never a good sign, but despite breaking every rule in the book, Jardin Nelson hits it out the park. Located in the always busy old Montréal neighborhood, Jardin Nelson features among the most unique dining spaces you'll find. A multi level semi covered outdoor garden, with an elevated jazz band overlooking the dining area. Truly beautiful. And the food? Mostly French inspired, but also featuring pizza, sandwiches, crepe, pasta, seafood, and even poke. Yes it's sort of all over the place, but the quality can't be denied. Quiet honestly, it doesn't even matter what you order...it's all good. Come one, come all, chez Jardin Nelson. Good eats meets good tunes meets great setting. All this equates to one of the most unique dining experiences around."

The serving staff were all very nice and bilingual. The restaurant is a creaperie , so i would recommend a crepe. My boyfriend and I both had them, and they were easily the best crepes of my life (the Nelsen and spicy chicken one). We also had an appetizer (Brie fondue) which came with grapes, pesto, and pine nuts. I would love to come here again for dessert, but frankly our bill was pricey enough for an appetizer, two crepes, a sangria, an iced cappuccino, and a hard cider. All were amazing and would 100% recommend to anyone in the old Montreal area. :) see you next time!"

I didn't read any reviews before coming, just saw the stars and decided to drop by at an odd hour (no line up).I was greeted by a greeter that asked me where I wanted to sit; front or bank. I replied with 'I want to sit inside' since I thought there was a bit of miscommunication and I was wrong. On the other side of the brick store front was an outdoor seating area with big umbrella tents. It looked like something out of a fairy tail and to add to the ambiance, they had live jazz music that reminds you of a speakeasy Disney sound track. I would go there just for coffee. I ordered beef tartare and French onion soup. Huge portions and bang for your buck (they don't even charge for extra bread). Way too much for 2ppl who were looking to snack. I don't eat cheese but if I did I would love the French onion soup, the cheese was crisp on top of a slice of bread that soaked up the soup. It created a beautiful cheese pull, I was waiting for my bf to finish the cheese but man there was just so much cheese beyond the surface! If you're not tight on time, I would spend some time here and enjoy what they have to offer."

My sister and I waited 30 min in line because we heard it was worth it, then another 30 min at our table to get the 2 chocolate banana crepes we ordered. The atmosphere is nice if you like jazz. Otherwise, it's too loud and cramped. The crepes were pretty terrible and so far from authentic, I would never order there again. They were a bit over cooked, too thick, and the chocolate tasted like syrup from a bottle. There are also only 4 dessert crepe options to choose from.

What's really amazing is that all of the walls are the originals from the 1800's!  Being in a garden setting with live jazz and a pitcher of sangria, the dinning experience was so awesome that who cares if the food is good or not!  All joke aside, the food wasn't bad either. Between the 4 of us, we ordered the calamari, chicken wings, French onion soup, cannoli, lobster roll, lobster Mac and cheese and aubergine au gratin. The only 2 dishes that made the cut was the French onion soup and baked cannoli.  The other dishes were just ok. The prices was fair taking into account the entertainment you get.  One word of advice, either come really early or later because the dinner rush line up is really long. The first time we came here, we were told 1hr+ wait, we came back the second night around 8pm and waited for 30mins.  The wait is worth it people!"

Is this real life?This place drips tourist, with the menu and location to fit. However, if you stick to the basics, you should be fine.I first came here years ago and the French onion soup was venerable. However, my recent visit, I went for the forestiere crepe. The crepe itself was fine. The crepe had a bit of crisp to it, while the filling inside was rich and flavorful. There was an abundance of brie and savory mushrooms. The accompaniment that came with the crepe was that side salad you first think of when it comes to French cuisine: jicama salad. The salad was fine, but just a bit strange for a crepe.Service was relatively friendly and my server was nice, especially since I could speak elementary French. However, I had to cringe when the American next table spoke French-ish and ended with ""por favor"".3.5 but I'll notch it up to a 4."

I knew immediately that we had to go there. There was live jazz playing which was super nice and gave the place a nice vibe. They even had speakers from the live performance hooked to the bathrooms so you can still hear the music. The patio area is outdoors but completely covered with these ginormous umbrellas. I loved it! They had flowers and plants everywhere and it was just such a nice spot to be to eat and relax. For food, I would 150% recommend the duck leg confit and salad! It was sooo flavorful and tender. We also got the beef tartare which was good but definitely not as memorable as the duck leg. We also got the poor man's pudding for dessert and it was a great way to end our meal. It kind of tasted like bread pudding but with a cornbread-y texture. It was warm and served with vanilla ice cream. Such a treat! I'll definitely be back here to listen to the jazz and eat the amazing duck the next time I'm in Montreal."

SO many delicious dishes, but my fave has to be the lobster meat salad. Pastas are all delicious as well, the pizzas are different and great, even the ribs are delicious.

Drank a strawberry smoothie to go with it on this warm day and it was super refreshing. Aside from the delicious food, the restaurant is beautifully decorated (as a garden like the name suggests).

Sitting in the garden and enjoying the live music while dining was a pleasant experience. I had the maple crepe (with maple gelato and maple syrup) for the first time: it was certainly something that opens your eyes to the world of maple-manic. The 3-scoop maple gelato cup we had the next night was amazing as well! I also need to praise the seafood crepe - it was overloaded with lobster chunks, shrimps and squids and baked in an overtly delicious bechamel sauce. Oh la la how I Admire the French quartier! Service was slow but friendly. They were willing to speak English to tourists from the west coast (unlike the French) despite my willingness to practice my awful French ...It seemed a lot of locals also went here as a spot.

Food: it was good but it seems the primary specialty is crepes which, on a hot and sticky day, doesn't really work too well but it is a preference! Waitress: excellent! She was so sweet and really seemed to care. We ordered the salmon tartar to start and before I even asked for it brought us extra bread because she figured it wasn't enough on the plate. Very thoughtful 5/5. The only thing that too away from the good experience is that we had to wait extremely long to get our main course--I assume no fault of hers. Ambience: yassssssssss. Loved the ambience! It is just such a superb location! Centre of old port but yet in the back you really get a great experience with jazz music, lots of greenery, and well seated tables. All in short, you should definitely come here for drinks and the good vibes, but don't expect high-end cuisine."

/user_details?userid=pkL_g2BM2ZVrv5_SAIpMhA,Dave S.,"Syracuse, NY",5 star rating,"In August my wife and I went on our honeymoon to Montreal, and while we were there we wanted to try somewhere a little different for a fancy dinner out. And when we told the woman at the front desk of our hotel what we were looking for. She immediately mentioned this place as being unique and a little different. And boy how was she right. This place is amazing. It's a bit of a touristy place I'm sure given that it's in old town on a road cars can't even travel on. And from the front it looks like just a nice little bistro. But when you actually walk in and see the large ""outdoor"" area with seating it's kind of mind boggling. It's almost like an MC Escher drawing with all the different tiers with tables and open sky above you shoved between a bunch of buildings. They do have these large umbrella like fixtures that can be used for sole coverage due to weather I'd guess and heaters on the walls surrounding. But for the most part you don't even notice they are there. Live jazz band playing on a stage on the far wall. It's like no place I've ever been or seen before. The food was delicious, and I'd normally go into that so much more. But trust me. The ambience alone on that terrace. It doesn't matter if you go there for a few drinks lunch or dinner. I'd make a return trip just for the hospitality we were given and the amazing jazz show on stage."

Obviously, the garden was closed off- so we settled for their outdoor terrace. The view is nice for tourists but for locals it can get old. The service was quick and pleasant, our waitress knew her menu inside out.We ordered a Caesar salad, with two kinds of Pam sized pizza (veggie and a shrimp with dill-the second of the two was phenomenal), onion soup (well made), and apple strudel for dessert. This was probably the highlight of the evening (2 pieces of bread baked with aged cheddar, bourbon, maple syrup, roasted pecans , and a side of vanilla ice cream). I probably would've enjoyed my meal in the garden which really adds the essence of this restaurant but until then-this is another mediocre fancy restaurant in Montreal along with the many others."

We had a plate of Quebec cheese and french onion soup. My companion had a martini and raved about how it was made with fresh raspberries. I enjoyed how it was shaken and poured at the table. The cheese was amazing and there was much bread and croutons (big crackery things) to go along with everything. There is an extensive wine menu. It is located on a plaza where there is lots to see and do and many people. There is a patio which we sat on both times we went here. There are heaters and we found it quite comfortable to sit on the patio in October.

It's a warm beautiful sunny Sunday, the birds and chirping, you drive or take the metro to the Old Montreal, you're surrounded by its charming cobble stone streets and the cold grey stone buildings casting shadows along your way down to Jardin Nelson. You go in, there's probably a line. Thirty minutes later you're seated, with your friend or partner, and there's live Jazz playing. The music is not too loud, nor too hushed. There are birds flying in the inside garden with an open sky and you're surrounded by luscious greens. As for food, you are given a few options from salads to crepes to tartares to other meat dish such as duck or rabbit. Service is polite and never fussed, and the food comes out warm and tasty. It won't be the best food you'll have in Montreal, but I would come for the ambiance. Tldr: Jardin Nelson has great live jazz band playing in a quasi outside garden where the food served is good, not the best but quite tasty nonetheless."

I wasn't a fan of the dressing and wish I had been given options like a balsamic rather than poppyseed or whatever it was, but that's neither here nor there...just get the lobster sandwich and you'll be a happy camper.Friends ordered pizza, tuna salad and beef tartar.

At first, I wanted to sit outside facing the cobblestoned walking area, but then I noticed the outside garden in the back and I had to go for it. It was absolutely stunning - the flowers were in full bloom, the trees cast a nice shade over the area, bees and birds buzzed around everywhere, and a live keyboardist and bassist kept us company with some beautiful Beatles cover songs. I was so pleased.The waitstaff was so unbelievably genial and friendly. The food was incredible, too - I had a diva crepe and a mojito with raspberries. Both were decently sized and excellently prepared. This place may err on the slightly more pricey side but I think it's worth it if you're looking for a meal that is the total package."

It goes really well on meat pizzas.The crepes are also good.The nachos, fried calamari and melting brie cheese on the other hand are not worth it. They taste quite ordinary.The drinks are also good. The Caribbean sangria was interesting but the basil lemonade was even betterBeing in an inside courtyard with live music also adds to the charm.Only advice is if you are coming here, come early.

/user_details?userid=rAlbFE2du6jk0_CWy52qOw,Troy D.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"The arrangements of mainstream pop songs passed off as ""Jazz"" at Jardin Nelson might more accurately be described as ""Elevator Music"" by a very kind critic. Any serious jazz student or professional studio musician might be more likely to describe the entertainment here as a horrific misappropriation of musical ability for commercial intents and purposes. The truth is, the music at this restaurant forgoes innovation and spontaneity, the hallmarks of jazz, in favor of lowest common denominator mass appeal. Nothing exemplifies this better than their cringe worthy rendition of the cantina song from Star Wars.Otherwise...The food also lacks innovation but is well prepared.The service is very good even at busy times.Best of all is the sangria."

I do not understand because this is currently 3pm and the restaurent is half empty but she still insist that the table is ONLY for 4 potential clients.

It's always packed and I've had the impression that it's packed with tourists. So I never even bothered taking a peek at their ""garden"". As summer is soon coming to end (yes it is), I was looking for a place that had live music, was outdoors, had vegetarian options and a selection of drinks and voila I thought of giving Jardin Nelson a try. They don't take reservations so we had to wait about 40min for the 4 of us. Parties of 2 were seated a lot faster than larger groups. But given the length of the line it went by pretty quickly and the hostesses were pleasant. I must say once we were seated in the garden the 40min wait was worth it! The live jazz was wonderful, the breeze, the flowers, the buildings that remained untouched yet you feel like you're in an outdoor sheltered place. And guess what if it rains you're pretty sheltered. We got to see these enormous umbrellas inflate and cover us up so quickly when the downpour started. All the rain water gets collected and recycled to water the plants they have on the walls. Pretty cool experience to see the umbrellas inflate and open up like ceilings above you. For how busy the night was, the service was pretty quick and the food was good. Nothing fancy, but you have a lot of options. They specialize in crepes and their pizzas, but the 4 of us tried other things, all of which were good. The salmon salad, salmon lasagna (apparently more like salmon gratin), tofu poke bowl (pretty good) and the eggplant al forno (came out piping hot!). Their sangrias are on the sweet side, not my thing. We went for their ""least sweet"" sangria which was the rose and peach sangria... can't imagine how sweet the other ones are. I'd definitely go back! It was a great evening with great ambiance, live music, plenty of options for food to satisfy everyone's palate (as well as for vegetarians)!"

I felt like Alice in Wonderland and I walked into a Secret Garden restaurant. Canadians truly are such kind and considerate people. Every waitress/waiter I encountered spoke French and English.

After attending a terrific performance at Cirque du Soleil we were hungry for a late dinner and some cocktails. After walking around the area looking for a place we peeked into the back courtyard of Jardin Nelson and immediately knew we found our spot.The back courtyard at night is all lit up wonderfully with large umbrellas overhead, flowered plants and trees, along with a band and amazing singer crooning old standards. The setting is magical and we loved it. In fact, we went back on another night during our vacation to Montreal to enjoy it again. We ended up with the same waitress both times and she was just outstanding, and she remembered us too.Great service, fresh tasty food, good drinks, romantic ambiance, live music in the back courtyard - we loved it all. Highly recommended over many other spots to eat at in the area, and I feel it's even better to come here without children at night if looking for a more romantic and adult kind of dining experience.Just a terrific spot to sit outside and dine at when the weather is nice while being serenaded with the cool sounds of Sinatra, jazz greats, and other sweet sounds."

Often pretty restaurants get by ""on their looks"" and serve substandard food and have crappy service. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and the prices were surprisingly low for a high volume tourist area. Their menu in expansive and the place is known for their crepes.  We started with a pitcher of rosé and peaches sangria for $33 ... so refreshing on a hot summer day.For appetizers, I did the oven baked crab cake ($19) and it was great. No flimsy strands of crab here, it was CHUNKS OF CRAB all throughout without any filler! This would be enough as a small meal for someone who is not piggy (not me) since it also came with salad. For my entrée I got the pate chinois au candard ($21), which was their duck confit shepard's pie. Yelpers were raving about this dish and once again my people did not lead me astray. I savoured every bite and they did not skimp on the duck. My friend got the lobster mac & cheese ($29) which had huge chunks of lobster throughout.Overall another top restaurant in Montreal with a unique setting and great food."

This restaurant was highly recommended and had a variety of selection of vegetarian food so we were excited. Definitely did not disappoint and would highly recommend it but make sure you make a reservation during high seasons because they do have long lines if just walking inFood - we ordered all vegetarian food - Small flatbread/pizza with roasted vegetables, Pastry with goat cheese and Jackfruit Poke bowl. All was very good though the pastry could do with a little more seasoning. Portions are adequate and the pizza and bowl were amazing in taste. We could not finish both items so took some of the flatbread home. Unfortunately we were too full to try the dessertService - exceptional and very friendly service provided by our waitress. Knowing we were vegetarians she made recommendations and even went extra steps to validate that any of the items did not have any animal products in sauce so kudos to her. Ambience - inside is amazing garden like atmosphere as they have plants and flowers all over plus they have free jazz music which was just the right level as it did not overpower your conversations but provided a nice backdrop of music. The place is huge and from the outside it does not look like a huge placeDefinitely go and try this place . You will enjoy the experience. They did not rush you at all (unlike restaurants in US that want to get you in and out in a hurry).

Go down to the Old Port...Nestled in the heart of it you can eat at an outside terrace between four buildings. Nice decor garden like. The Good: they play live jazz 7 days a week. There's plenty of choices with their speciality crepes. We got La Forestière crêpe which is garlic, white wine, mushroom with asparagus and salmon on a bed of spinach rice vermicelli. Overall affordable.The Bad. Well you're at a garden so a lot of healthy choices. There are choices for those who may want to eat something like pasta or steak but- this ain't it. The Ugly: during supper hours lineups:( which can take at least 20-30 minutes. But if you don't mind waiting then it's worth it. Tip: don't do what we did and try to enter at St Paul ( because we saw the live jazz more from this side) go to St Jacques..this adds to your waiting time to get in. On a nice summer day get dessert elsewhere and coffee better choices outside.Stroll along the port and maybe take a ride on Montreal's ferris wheel, largest in Canada. Cost wise $$"

I would suggest starting or ending your evening here, but skipping the place for your main meal.The beef tartare was really good (according to my husband), but my seafood crepe was both too bland and too rich at the same time. Our waiter was friendly, but overburdened with tables of impatient tourists and big families."

Two separate instances of birds defecating onto our table, first on the menu while I was reading, the second time into one of our glasses of water. Very easily could have been distracted and not noticed.

We were visiting Montreal and had an amazing experience at Jardin NelsonTo start with, when we got there, there was a big line up. The host told me that it would be around a 30 minute wait. Then he saw three little hungry kids with us and whispered something into the ears of another hostess. They didn't make the kids wait for food and put us at a table immediately. That was so nice of them. The ambience was amazing. On a beautiful summer night, the live band playing some jazz, the multi-level patio, the lighting, the smiles of the staff, made it all a lovely experience.The food was delicious. Starting from the ceviche, to the fondue, to the crepes to the pizza, to the beef tartare, everything was flavorful and heavenly.Even the pudding for dessert was freshly baked in the oven and was just wow!Of course not to mention the service at the table was excellent.I highly recommend this place to anyone. I would go there again next time I visit.And hey, it wasn't pricy at all. Very reasonably priced."

They charge us $70 Canadian dollars for 3 drinks, a soup and the calamari app. We ordered drinks on the rocks and they gave it to us in a tall cocktail glass that was not practical for a drink on the rocks. The Ice kept slapping my mouth whenever I'd tilt my head back to drink. The server was nice. The live band was great.

After that we shared a salad which was far from good. It a poke bowl with chicken. It has a weird taste. We had some fries too which were not so good.

It was great to hear a live jazz combo in that setting. It sometimes veered into cheesy cover song territory, but was really good when they stuck to actual jazz. The food was decent but a bit underwhelming - the salmon salad has no greens, just vermicelli noodles without discernible sauce, and though I liked my lobster salad more then my guy did, I did find that encasing it in dairy and fruit did nothing to celebrate the unique flavour of the magnificent animal that died for me. Service was really, really slow because they're so busy, and our upper patio table kept getting blasted with heat from the kitchen vent on the roof, but otherwise it was a terrific lunch experience in a cool spot."

We were a party of 5 and got seated fairly quickly. Service was nice, no pressure, although once it got busy I felt like they were a bit understaffed.The food! We ordered a chicken poke bowl, so delicious my husband practically licked the plate. Also ordered the curry chicken crepe, superb, the jardín crepe and added chicken, the veggie crepe, and a veggie pizza. The poke bowl and curry chicken crepe were my favorite.Drinks, local beer, long Island iced tea, caipirinha and bourbon bloody Mary. The bloody Mary with bourbon was a lovely surprise and I will never drink another Bloody Mary with vodka.Oh and our friend had a birthday and the dessert was classy and out of this work delicious. 10 out of 10 would go again even if I had to wait.The band was also excellent and the whole place is just beautiful.

/user_details?userid=-jHpOIReEQXYymg3duqqqg,Ling X.,"Bergen County, NJ",5 star rating,"You can't beat the ambience here. I specifically avoided dessert at the restaurant I ate dinner at, so that I could spend some time here in the short weekend I had in Montreal. (The dinner menu looked good but we had made reservations elsewhere already). We ordered the pouding chomeur, which is basically a maple syrup bread pudding. It was way too sweet, but I think that is the nature of the dessert itself and nothing bad by the restaurant.  I felt bad that we didn't order anything else (I was sugared out with that pouding) but since it was close to closing time, the server didn't give us the stink-eye. The live jazz music, the outdoor floral and fauna that gave the garden effect, the lighting ....it was the perfect ending to the night. Of my snapchats from all over Montreal, Jardin Nelson received the chat back of, ""What is your life??"". Sitting in the courtyard, I couldn't help but think, what is this life, indeed."

A great place to look out for from mid-April onwards as they're solely a patio (front and back garden) restaurant and so open only for those coveted months. Situated smack downtown by the waterfront in Montreal meant we were in for a line up. They didn't take reservations either. But rest assured that it's worth the wait. The atmosphere was superb and there was live music serenading us in the lovely sunshine out at the back.We had a small pitcher of the rose peach sangria (~$22), which poured ~4 small glasses. It was certainly refreshing for the warm day but a little pricey in my opinion.Food wise I had most difficult time deciding on. Ended up with the duck confit crepe. It was DE.LI.CIOUS. The duck filling was so creamy, with the slightest hint of sweetness from the cranberries. The crepe was also very thin and crispy. Definitely would recommend it."

The fries were a bit cold , soggy and flavourless like they had been sitting out from the morning and attempted to be reheated. The burger looked good but had a very odd taste and strange after taste that was off putting. I was starving and ate it, but couldn't even finish it all. Even the guacamole had an odd really processed taste. Don't be fooled by the nice ambiance and DON'T eat here."

I came here for brunch last week and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious the back patio was, and how good the food was. We had the quatre fromages pizza which was, as you may have guessed, topped with 4 different types of cheeses and was absolutely delicious. The crust itself was not too thick, and the cheese was layered on and cooked perfectly, to make for a super filling and savory pizza you could share with one other person. We then had the zoodles, which was just zucchini noodles  with cheese on top and drizzled with a light sauce- a good compliment to the heavier pizza we had. For dessert, we had the crepe with nutella, strawberries, and was drizzled in another berry sauce. The crepe was delicious, and it was nice to see they did not skip out on the nutella. I also wanted to mention the AMAZING the maple syrup iced latte I had. It was actually not too sweet, which is what I was scared of, and it tasted SO GOOD."

Both times were great, however, this restaurant earns more praise for its atmosphere than its food. There's a live jazz band most days, beautiful outdoor seating, wondrous views, and fantastic service. The food is not memorable or legendary but it gets the job done. I ordered a baked duck dish, which I didn't think would be much like a Shephard's Pie but it was? Last time I ordered a salmon pizza that I didn't care much for. Appetizers here, for some reason, are really good. I ordered the brie fondue and the calamari and both were so tasty. Much more memorable than my main dish. Anyway, most of my friends ordered a crepe, and while I never had any of Jardin Nelson's crepes, I just think they look so weird. If you're American, you'll think: ""Whoa, that crepe looks like a quesadilla."""

It is beautifully maintained and adorned with flowers...the garden also has these majestic canopy umbrellas, rain or shine you will be fine! They also have live jazz acts which adds to creating such a relaxing and ambiance ! Service is always super friendly. Now for the food...although this resto is located in a highly touristic area, the food is actually very good! I tried their poke bowl which is a new item on the menu and truly enjoyed it!  Tasty and refreshing! I also had their cheesecake crepe which was delicious! They are known for their wonderful variety of crepes! Lots of choices!  They also have amazing cocktails..however if you care for a glass of Sangria...they only have it in a pitcher size.

About an hour later 4 dishes arrived and 2 appetizers arrived.   The waiter assured us that two other dishes would arrive shortly (will describe the dishes in a minute).  After all the first delivered dishes were eaten, we waited; and waited; and 25 minutes later my dish arrived (beef tartar); with one person's dish still not ready, we felt finished the tartar and waited for the last dish.  And Waited; and waited.Finally my gf, was still waiting for the dish confronted the waiter who assured us the dish was on its way; and we waited; and waited for at least 10-15 more minutes. By the time it arrived we all wanted to leave.  She reluctantly ate her dish but by then, the damage had been done and the experience ruined.Based on our discussion with the waiter, there appeared to be a misunderstanding but come on, 2 1/2 hours before the last dish arrived?Come on management.  Educate your waiters and waitresses on more professional time management skills.  The waiter although polite and up front in explaining us what happened, he lacked true empathy and was oblivious to how pathetically late the last dish was.  Maybe clarify with your customers next time the approximate timing of when things are served?  I mean why would you feed 4 people immediately and have appetizers to two others and than have an hour and thirty minute delay for the 5th and 6th person's main course?  Made no sense at all to me.Let's talk about the dishes I sampled which I felt were hit or miss:1.  The Salmon Pizza topped with arugula : 2.5/5 Stars.  Too dry and not much love in it.  My 12 year old nephew loved it and gave it 5/5. For kids, it's a great dish.2.  The half a rack of ribs cooked in a maple syrup sweetened BBQ Sauce.  Pretty interesting.  4/5.  A little too sweet for my palate but pretty good quality here.3.  French Onion Soup: 5/5: how can you mess this up?  Tasted great.4.  Beef Tartar: 4/5.  Very good (I have had better) with a nice garlic mayonnaise, Dijon and pickles w/fries (3/5: just ok)5.  Lobster Mac'n'Cheese: 3/5:  too rich and buttery and cheesy to me.  It was hard to appreciate the lobster with all that butter and cheese.  It took 2 1/2 hours to cook that?  Come on...the waiter waited too long submitting this order to the kitchen or maybe the kitchen took a lunch break for and hour and a half?  Something in the food serving paradigm was screwed up here.Finally, the a atmosphere was uncomfortably noisy.  With the noise trying to push one out of the establishment and with the slow service, it felt like being locked in solitary confinement.This rating is based on coming here on a busy day.  If the crowds were not bad OR if the food had been delivered in a reasonable amount of time I could see this place being a 3.5 place.Because of the memory of discomfort due to the uncomfortably long wait, I doubt I would come here on a busy Montréal summer night.The staff in general are pretty friendly but not very reliable and seemed predictably slow."

Our server was attentive, kind, and helped us decide what to get.The drinks were surprisingly strong, especially for noon on a Friday. My Moscow Mule was nice and strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed her smoothie. We ended up sharing the baked goat cheese and the local cheese plate. The goat cheese was wrapped in a flaky pastry and served over a pesto sauce and a red pepper sauce. Really good.

The combination of flavours is amazing. We also shared a sausage, egg and cheese crepe which of course was so delicious. A couple of breakfast cocktails, delicious food and live jazz music in the open air makes for a great start to our first full day in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"I know this is a Montreal institution, and there's a lot to be said for the quaint and charming romanticism of the courtyard, surrounded by old stone building facades, in the heart of Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of cobblestoned Old Montreal. Add a sunny day and the soft swells of sweet music from the live jazz quartet playing on the side of the courtyard, and it's hard to find fault with such a seemingly perfect locale and environment. In fact, if I were ranking this place solely on atmosphere alone, it would rate 100 stars. It's the stuff of postcards and coffee table book photos. But we must rank restaurants mostly on their food, and their service, and here's where this jardin loses its blooms. It started badly. Our party of five was promptly seated at a lovely table and one of us was getting quite dehydrated (it was near 90 degrees and we had been doing a lot of walking). She immediately requested water upon being seated. The hostess said sure, and our server said she'd bring water right away. Both disappeared, not to be seen again for seemingly ages. My friend, feeling weak, eventually intercepted another server, asking - pleading - for some water (this was about 20 minutes after being seated at our table). This other server said she'd pass the message on to our server. Another 10-15 minutes elapsed. Nobody came to our table. Finally my friend got up and walked to the hostess counter to complain. Simultaneously, our server came to our table to take our orders, no waters in hand. This was a good 30 minutes after we'd been seated on a sweltering day. The food was mediocre (except for the crepes, which were delicious). I had a ""Nordic shrimp"" appetizer which I had asked about prior to ordering (I had no idea what Nordic shrimp were, nor did anyone in my party. As it turns out, they are what we Americans call ""baby shrimp"". The waitress neglected to tell me that the shrimp would be coated in copious amounts of mayonnaise). My friend asked for a salad and the server asked if she wanted chicken or shrimp on it. My friend said neither please. They ended up charging for the salad with chicken on it. When asked, the server said it was the same price. Another friend had requested a Mediterranean crepe but with no olives, to which the server said the mixture was ""premade"" and the cannot remove the olives. (So much for freshly made dishes, eh? And customer service. They sure aim to please here - NOT). And it was pricey, too.All in all, it was not a stellar experience. Yes, the setting is stunning but the rest of the experience, unfortunately, subpar."

It's got a vibe all its own.Your main focus at Jardin should be salads. The rest of their menu can be hit or miss, but these folks do salads right. Also a nice place to stop by for a drink, not necessarily for a full meal though.Touristy or not, if you're a Montrealer, a foodie, and you've never eaten here... Aim to mend the errors of your ways, to redeem your soul. You deserve it.They're only open in the summer though, it's an open air dining sort of situation."

We did however expect the prices to match the dish. We ordered a couple savoury crepes and a pizza. I envied the BF who had the pizza after being served my crepe which was more like a calzone meets omelette. I really hope tourists don't think this is what a crepe is after eating here! The coleslaw it was served with was bland with barely any dressing and the plates and baskets they used to serve was reminiscent to a pub which didn't fit into their gorgeous decor.The only saving grace this place has is the awesome live jazz they have and the beautiful setting they play in. Service here is also great as both our hostess and server were super friendly and polite. If you really must visit here, consider drinks or an appetizer (we had calamari to start which was good) over food."

We sat in the very large back garden patio which is quite pretty and gave us a break from the wind in the streets that day, but still allowing us to sit outside. The jazz duo happened to be a bit cheesy that day but pleasant as background music, playing jazz versions of many pop songs. We got the duck confit salad, which was delicious as well as the baked eggplant casserole, which I recommend as a dish to share between several people. It is way too big for one or even two people to share. This would be a great restaurant to accommodate groups of 6 or more and to go with your family. There is plenty of room and the kitchen is clearly experienced and prepared for large numbers of guests."

The 4 of us shared 2 appetizers, a pizza and a chocolate crepe. The portion was small. So if you are hungry and want to share you should order the full dinner portion instead of appetizers. We liked everything we ordered but our favorite was definitely the ribs. The order was kind of on the slow side but service was good. Definitely will go back if I visit Montreal again."

/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was a gorgeous summer's evening last week when my girlfriends and I met up for dinner at Jardin Nelson. I had passed the beautiful botanical restaurant many times when exploring the Old Port but never had a chance to try it. As this restaurant does not accept reservations, we queued up in a long line for about 40 minutes! Once entering through the leafy doorway, it was evident that this place was definitely worth the wait. From the outside it looks very small as you can only see a few tables on the exterior terrasse. However, once you go through the entrance, it is huge inside, a vast open courtyard circled by two levels with lots of tables! On Saturday evening, it was completely packed by couples, families and friends... This restaurant is a perfect setting for any type of adult gathering. I immediately fell in love with the gorgeous ambiance... It was like walking into an enchanted garden surrounded by greenery and pretty flowers, whilst the melody of soft live jazz music filled the air. Our table was located by a huge tree that stands over the restaurant and is decorated with tiny lights - under a summer evening sky, it really was the perfect setting for a delicious meal.Now on to the food. For appetizers we had the Nachos Nelson, roasted shrimps and fries basket. For a group of 4 girls, we were unable to finish! The nachos portion is huge and very very filling. I have never had nachos like this before... An entire layer of 3 cheese melted together over crispy nachos which lay on a bed of cranberry salsa and beans... So good I could have it as an entire meal! The fries were presented in a tiny deep fryer basket which was cute but quite a small portion. For the main course we shared the Du Marché pizza and Eggplant al forno. The pizza was a mixed vegetable pizza, tasty but let down by the artichoke which I felt did not work with the rest of the flavours. The oven baked eggplant was interesting - very fresh whole eggplant baked for some time with cheese and tomato sauce. Worth trying if you are an aubergine fan! The restaurant prides itself in its vast selection of drinks so I opted for the Fruité mocktail which was a combination of sweet and tangy. Overall, I had a wonderful meal and experience at Jardin Nelson. For a moment, it gives the feeling as if you are somewhere magical and far away from the noise and bustle of city life and construction. The ingredients definitely were very fresh and cooked to perfection. Our waitress was extremely hospitable and courteous which made us not want to leave the place.Despite it being a popular touristic spot, I definitely recommend it to local Montréalers. Cannot wait to visit this secret garden again!"

If you want a nice place to sit down and enjoy a local meal as a tourist, this is well worth your time and money. There is a beautiful open air courtyard with live music and multiple levels of dining. We stopped by here on a weekday afternoon for lunch before leavin . The staff was extremely professional and helpful to us out-of-towners. You really should order a crepe if you are looking to get the most out of this restaurant. Although I saw others order other items, this place is notorious for crepes. I ordered the Filet de Porc and it was really tasty! Plenty of pork, so many fresh ingredients. These crepes are very very large by the way. My bf ordered the Rable de lapin (rabbit) which was also full of many ingredients and super flavorful. The slaw that came with the crepes was amazing too! I ordered a drink as well and it was very well made. Great quality, large quantities and I feel that the prices are fair for what you get. It gets crowded so be sure to go during quiet hours. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line to be seated."

/user_details?userid=SGD3fcbg-46DCA1WBfVPcA,Hunter M.,"Gorham, ME",1 star rating,"Walking by this restaurant, it seems like a no-brainer that this would be a great place to enjoy some live jazz and cocktails in a cool outdoor venue.  It's unfortunate that the unapologetically apathetic staff undermines what could be one of the coolest spots in Montreal's Old Port.  My girlfriend and I came in around 10:30 on a Saturday night for some drinks and dessert.  We decided to split a pitcher of sangria while we perused the menu.  Initially the waiter brought the wrong pitcher, but that wasn't a big deal.  When he returned with the correct drink, we ordered a dessert crepe to split and the wait began.  It was a busy night and we were enjoying the music so we genuinely were not bothered by the slow service initially.  However, as midnight rolled around, we started to wonder what had happened to our dessert.  I stopped the waiter as he was walking by and asked if he knew how much longer our crepe would be.  He took me by surprise with his response of ""You didn't order a crepe.""  I calmly explained to him that we did in fact order it, and my girlfriend corroborated.  Shockingly, the waiter continued to adamantly argue with me that I had not ordered a crepe and that he would've remember if I had.  After some back and forth as he refused to admit fault, I remained calm and explained that we weren't upset.  We had been enjoying the music, and understood that it was a busy night; but we had absolutely ordered a crepe an hour and a half ago.  Finally, he offered me an exasperated apology and said ""Well do you still want the crepe?""  I was truly taken aback with his reaction.  Had he just apologized, and taken responsibility for the mistake, I would not be writing this review.  I truly wasn't bothered by the wait itself.  It was his astonishingly indignant response that left a bad taste in our mouths.A few minutes later, he returned with an adequate but unexceptional crepe filled with almost completely melted vanilla ice cream -and I can only assume- a sizable glob of our waiter's saliva.  We paid the bill in full (we were still charged for the crepe), left the customary minimum 15% for the waiter, and asked to speak to the manager on our way out so that we could express our disappointment with the strange situation that had unfolded.  A few minutes later the hostess returned with the manager, his eyes glistening with indifference and his forced smile revealing everything I needed to know before he uttered a word.  I reached my hand out to introduce myself, he stared at it for a moment, and then reluctantly shook it as I explained the events of the past two hours.  Did he apologize for the unfortunate circumstance?  No.  Did he express understanding for our frustration?  No.  Did he offer any kind of consolation to maintain a feeling of goodwill between us and his establishment?  No.  His only response was: ""The waiter probably didn't hear you.""I thanked him and left.  I truly wanted to enjoy my evening at this restaurant which obviously has a lot of raw potential and I offered both the waiter, and the manager, opportunities to make things right; however, they simply couldn't do that and I therefore felt obligated to write this review as a warning to future customers.  If you are looking to enjoy a beverage at Jardin Nelson, expect a bitter cocktail of stubbornness, apathy, and arrogance."

This is a nice place to go to when it's nice out and to sit in their outside back patio/jazz garden. I've always had great service and tasty food here. They have some nice cocktails and desserts as well. The ambience alone is so nice and relaxing and makes you feel like you're on vacation and on weekends when they have the live music it's even better (the music isn't overly loud to disrupt your dinner convo. I've tried their pizza , their salmon lasagna and their duck croque Monsieur and each of them was good so for me I feel like you can't go wrong with really with any item on their menu -at least in my experience to date. Their cocktails are good too they pack enough punch for your dollar and the flavours and variety are there as well. Very nice place to visit when you're in the old port and very nice choice for a date restaurant. The prices are reasonable given the location and quality of food ambience and service , not overly cheap but not crazy pricey either. Just be prepared to wait in line during peak hours and seasons as they don't take reservations last I asked but there's lots of seating so I've never waiting a crazy amount of time for a table.

At first, I wasn't too impressed by the brunch menu, but I decided to settle on an salmon, egg, goat cheese omelette/casserole.

Food is fine, nothing special, overpriced as you imagine any other touristy spot in Old Port would be. You end up at this type of place for the experience not the food. If you're visiting Montreal and have just finished up enjoying the cobble stone roads, the port, and the Notre Dam, it's a great place to stop by for a drink. I recommend the blue curacao sangria. It's delicious! Jardin Nelson has two patios; one in the front facing the craziness of Place Jacques Cartier and the other more private terrace in the back. I always choose to sit in the back terrace. There is sometimes a wait, but it's never been too long. The back terrace has vines & flowers running up its stoned walls. The terrace is split into split level balconies and there is usually live jazz music. I used to take my mother and her friends here when they visited me during my university years in Montreal.

Boy was that wrong! It all started with the stale bread served at the table. It's a crepe place right? Their crepes should be good? I had the rabbit saddle crepe and it came out dry dry dry. Dousing it in cheese did not help either the crepe itself or the stringy meat inside. The crepe was also too thick and too sweet. My friends had the bland oven baked salmon lasagna and the steak tartar which was oddly paired with stale and cold fries. Take a pass on this place. Montreal has too many great places to eat to waste calories in this.

/user_details?userid=GAyOjFNZv9vwKOR3zDFw5g,Wilhelmina T.,"Berkeley, CA",4 star rating,A beautiful restaurant with seating in the front to people watch or you can dine in the open courtyard while listening to a live jazz duo. It was beautiful and definitely made the trip here worth the wait. We ordered crepes and a pork sandwich which came with deliciously crunchy fries. I would give extra stars had the food not taken so long to come out. It was much longer than I thought crepes would take but considering the number of customers they had you just have to roll with it.
/user_details?userid=0Kv0DMrzhDLFGgTjH1rmXg,Ross M.,"Hammonds Plains, Canada",5 star rating,"Jardin Nelson can be found in the Historic square of Old Port Montréal. (Place Jacques-Cartier, 407 Place Jacques Cartier, Montréal).I must say, every time I come to Montréal I always pay a visit to Jardin Nelson, it's one of my favorite go to restaurants in the city( for work or play).Jardin Nelson is well known for their ambiance. To set it up you walk through a historic stone enclave where it opens up into their beautiful huge courtyard and gardens with white canvas sail canopies (some stretched over 40' feet, reaching high into the blue sundrenched sky or into the romantic sparkle of nighttime stars).  Add in some live jazz playing in the background and you're surrounded in an atmosphere that is amazing!The menu will satisfy the most discerning of palates. It runs from fresh crisp salads, tasty sandwiches and salmon entree to delicious pizzas and then, the ultimate cornerstone of Jardin Nelson in my opinion, their Crêpes. I have to admit, I'm hooked, can't help it, can't get enough, bar none, drool tested and approved the best Crêpes I have ever devoured. We ordered two styles of crêpes. The first was their classic, tasty, breakfast, lunchtime, dinner time, oh the hell with it...... anytime Nelson crêpe. It's made with this sweet crêpe batter and then they add a homemade sweet apple stuffing, filled with bacon (did I say bacon) your damn right I did and lots of bacon. Then a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a touch of cinnamon and pure maple syrup! I'm salivating right now thinking about how good that crêpe really is.The second crêpe we ordered was the Aiguillettes de Canard confit. Are you kidding me? (I ask with great enthusiasm) Crêpes with duck breast confit! I have to tell you when we cut into this crêpe the fragrance and taste was pure heaven.This is a savory and filling crêpe folks, it's made with a duck breast aiguillettes, surrounded in cheddar and mozzarella cheese and it has this creamy smooth cranberry orange sauce that lifts this dish into a explosion of heavenly goodness. We tied this great meal all together with a pitcher of their well known and top rated Red Wine Sangria and we were done. Hang up the phone and put your feet up, satisfied beyond! If you looking for a cool place to lunch or a romantic place under the stars with great drinks, exceptional food and ambiance Jardin Nelson in Old Port Montréal has a place for you.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=63RMC0LxibWFTlHOGgseGw,Priti R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I never thought I'd love such a tourist place, but Jardin Nelson did a good job of kicking that idea out of my head. First, we came on a GORGEOUS Saturday afternoon in Montreal. Of course, the city is filled with tourists during the summer which leave places like this to be packed. We were given an option to wait for a table out front (which we were the first in line) or proceed to the back line which is for the garden area out back. The line was much longer, but once we saw how fast it was moving, we moved over to the back line. We were seated within 5 minutes. The line was SUPER long, but larger parties were in front of us and they were able to seat 2 people quicker than a party of 6. We were seated RIGHT next to the live band. Perfect music for a gorgeous weekend afternoon. The menu is quite large, which is kind of a turn-off for me (more options means more time til the food gets in my belly!) They've got a few options for sangria - we opted for the peach one (a must try!!). Started with the bruchetta - tomato party ova here! More tomatoes than I knew what to do with (to my delight). Then we ordered a veggie pizza, which normally, I think 3+ ingredients on a pizza is a little too much, but NOT on this one. It was a great suggestion by our server, who was polite and friendly. This place is BUSY. It's FILLED. They are great at turning over the tables. We were seated right when many others tables were, so I fear that it'd take a long time for our food to come out. NOPE! Our food came out not even 10 minutes after ordering. It actually arrived faster than I had thought. I'm very impressed at how this place functions at such a fast pace, considering I used to work at a Cheesecake Factory and this was never the case during the busy period. Not to mention the proximity to the water is prime. Not even a 5 minute walk if I remember correctly. I'd love to come back here on my next visit to this pretty city."

Our server was training a new girl, on her very first day and she did a fantastic job. Every menu item we had was spot on- pizzas, salmon platter, lobster sandwich, crepes and bruschetta.

And what a huge serving, as well.-cannelinois au four maison: 4 baked cannolisI wish we had saved some room for the desserts and crepes, but there's always next time!  As we left, the host and owner (I'm guessing?) told us that they are only open during the late spring-early fall, so come here while you can!3.5 stars for the food, but 5 stars for the ambiance and environment...and friendly host :) Worth coming here for the experience of sitting on their outdoor terrace and listening to the wonderful jazz music they have!"

The Tropical Sangria was the beverage of choice and the sweet and colorful concoction proved to be the perfect start. I tried the soup of the day; Cauliflower Curry soup and my companion ordered the Frites AU Panier (Basket of French fries). For entrée I had the Lobster mac&chesse (OMG!!!!!!!!!!, really, just fabulous!!!!!)

Pretty cool :) My friends and I enjoyed Bloody Cesars and multiple orders of fries, which were tasty. A jazz band was playing the entire time, which added to the relaxed vibe.

Finally the cold water came with our orders and surprisingly she took my bill to me at same time and we are the only table she did this. This made me very uncomfortable. 20 minutes later she came back and asked me pay with cash or card?! OMG, Do we look like to escape your payment? Totally made me frustrated and told her we are not ready to pay yet. She left. But she came to us to ask to pay again after 20 minutes. I don't like to see her anymore and ask her for the machine to pay. The bar is beautiful but the services are ugly! They are racism to Asian people!

Doing dining hours it has long lines. They have no ceilings, just walls inside. I know it sounds strange but between the big umbrella's the rain doesn't matter. The patio outside is covered. I also saw heaters in case it's chilly. One reason for limited hours. Not a bad meal on the menue. If you like Jazz around six in the evening a really good jazz band plays. They even went out of their way when we requested something they didn't have in the case, and by the next set found the music sheet for the request. No matter what you must have the dessert. Take it with you if you don't have room. Never had a bad meal, it's also good if you want to sit on the patio and have a drink and appetizer.

As we were outside reading the menu, a local came up to us and told us that of all the places around here, this is the place to go, and prices are reasonable. So we went in and were pleasantly surprised :)In the garden area, is a wonderful terrace with large flower-like umbrellas, lots of beautiful flowers and brick walls. There's also a live jazz band. Lots of great choices on the menu, but I decided to go safe and choose a salad, because it was hot out and i haven't had fruits in a couple of days. I chose la salade estivale, which came to about $18 after tax. It has a variety of fruits, cubes of feta, pork filet and two sauces. I didn't like the sauces. But i must say, the pork is extremely TENDER, and packed with flavour! I was surprised it's even pork.Nachos were huge, i think they were soggy by the time you get half way. The goat cheese pastry appetizer is comfort food.If you are getting dessert, you must get the biscuit géant/the giant cookie! Served on a cast iron skillet, it's a soft dough with ice cream on top. The crunch from the pecans gives it a great contrast. It's a treat worth eating the whole thing to yourself.With the bill, comes with a rate-us-on-how-we-did card, which i appreciated. I like places who care about their service, food and how to make the customer's experience better. You know a business cares about improving when they are open to suggestions.The environment is absolutely relaxing and entertaining and I'd like to try their french onion soup next time!"

Juicy, flavorful duck with a tart raspberry demi-glace, the salad is similar to panera's strawberry poppyseed with a peppery twist - all in all, a DELICIOUS MEAL that leaves room for one of their MANY desserts.  My mother enjoyed her duck crepe and my brother REALLY enjoyed his Crepe Nelson (apple pie, bacon, cheese and maple syrup - tastes like breakfast!).

The live jazz was perfect.  We tried other restaurants the next day, but nothing topped this restaurant, so we came back here on our last day.  I tried both the baby ribs and the duck over salad.. highly recommend !!! Also,  the rosè and peaches sangria was great.  My favorite restaurant in montreal :) . HIGHLY recommend!!! Make sure to come early!"

/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,The one restaurant a friend recommended we go to in Montreal was Jardin Nelson simply for their French onion soup. This place is in Old Montreal and the inside doesn't let you forget that with the stone walls. It's cool!All we ordered was the French onion soup and it was amazing! One bowl was enough for each of us and we slowly ate it to savor every bite. It also helped that it was pouring down rain so soup was the perfect lunch!Definitely stop here to try heir French onion soup if you're visiting Old Montreal.

/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great location for locals and visitors to have a bite to eat in the day or evening. Right in the center of old Montreal. They often have a live jazz band which I found not too disruptive if you're trying to have a conversation. A quick note that I found unfortunate is if u are ordering crepes most of them have cheese in them and you can't asked to remove the cheese. There is still a selection but expect a limited choice of crepes if u can have cheese.

First time we came in it was a Friday night, the wait was excruciating after an hour wait we end up leaving our spot on the line and went somewhere else,  second time our luck is much better we came in very late i think it was almost midnight and waited about 5 minutes and got seated few rows from the stage where they have band playing jazz music, we ordered desserts and coffee, food was ok, its the ambience and the music that sell me out... the Crepe although savory i feel like it is too dry, could have more sauce on it or something.

Only open a few months a year, the best time to visit, in my opinion, is when the line isn't miles long! Reservations unfortunately aren't a possibility. The actual location and spot is beautiful, complete with a live jazz band soundtrack to accompany your meal. Huge, and quite intricate umbrellas cover overhead and brick walls fill in the remainder. I must say, in Montreal, this is one of the sickest places to visit.However, the food is alright despite their array of options. I do believe there is something for everyone. That being said, everytime I've been, I've never been truly impressed, then again I may be setting my expectation too high. The drink list, on the other hand, is rad-especially for summer drinks.If you're willing to accept the long line, possibly and probably slow service due to low staff and crowd, you will have a great time!

/user_details?userid=-tWIE0poXefIp-lxQ0rWbQ,Jean-francois B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I really liked this restaurant. The live jazz music band really helps your experience and you feel like you're in a little garden (you have the choice to eat in the garden or at the terrace). There is a wide and interesting selection of drinks that you can choose from. I took as an appetizer the flaky with creamy goat cheese and it was delicious. As the main dish I took a forester crepe and my girlfriend chose the cannellonis. Both of them were really good. As dessert we took the orange tiramisu and it was OK but could taste more 'orangee'. The waiter was really welcoming and the service was good. I would recommend this place to anyone if they are willing to pay a bit more than usual because it is a bit pricey (we are at the old port after all!).  I will definitely will go back!

/user_details?userid=R2-tQdbMS8MVQc6MGUTbLQ,Ha N.,"Chapel Hill, NC",5 star rating,"The food alone might not necessarily be 5 stars, but I really think that the overall package is well worth it. My family of 9 got a table very quickly because there was ample seating, so big groups are going to be very comfortable here. The service was friendly and prompt. No finished plate stayed on the table for more than a few minutes and I always got my water on time--amazing since I pretty much inhale water when dining out. They waitress also gave us a tip on how to calculate tip--the taxes add up to be 15% of the subtotal. We usually give 20%, so it's not hard to calculate, but the advice was unprompted and so honest that it was pretty endearing. We got:Duck Confit Salad--probably my favorite thing that day. The duck confit was tender and flavorful and the portions of duck and salad were very balanced. The salad had ample fresh fruit and just the right amount of dressing. I just loved every bite. Rabbit Crepe--pretty rich, but accompanied by a nice little salad that I thought cut down the richness of the dish a little. Seafood Crepe--definitely loaded with seafood and had a prominent taste of vermouth. Surprisingly not too rich even with the cream sauce and cheese. Beet Salad--my second favorite. This place seriously made me reconsider ordering salads at restaurants (I usually refrain). Everything tasted fresh--the most important thing about a salad--and it was tasty and very summery. French Onion Soup--pretty flavorful but salty. I couldn't have much of it at all. We also had a couple of other things, but I didn't get to try it. The crepes alone are a good enough portion to fill you up. It took a lot of coordination to try a piece of everything without getting too full. Definitely returning here."
/user_details?userid=AnbvqiiOGhg_0XSQfreLnA,Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"I agree with a lot of the reviews mentioning the average food, but it was good enough to enjoy and the ambiance made the place better.We had the bell pepper shrimp to start, which was pretty good but kind of pricey at $16. I had the cannelloni casserole dish and my boyfriend had the ribs. Let me just side track and say that their menu is extensive, there's a little something for everyone, but Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible once said the more menu items available the more flustered people get at deciding what to eat. That's exactly how I felt and after trying our dishes we realized that we impulsively chose wrong. The meat in the cannelloni was under cooked, but the cheese and tomato sauce had good flavor. The ribs were slathered in thick BBQ sauce - which tasted straight out of a bottle. My boyfriend enjoyed them but I thought they were really mediocre. We also got as pitcher of the peach rose and that was kind of disappointing. It was too sweet and flat. The giant cookie we had for dessert was the redeeming dish for Le Jardin.The service was pretty good, our waitress was friendly and checked in often.The only thing this place has going is the incredible outdoor area with the huge retractable umbrellas and the flower adorned brick walls. The umbrellas opened up just in time to avoid getting everyone soaked. The center pole of the largest umbrella collected the rain water and it was actually pretty cool. The jazz band played in the background throughout the night, which was a nice touch.I guess this place is worth checking out if you've never been but I wouldn't return."

I'll give it three stars for the atmosphere (great outdoor seating on a pleasant summer night) and for the attentive waitstaff. But the food was very mediocre, unfortunately I suppose that's expected for a restaurant in a tourist district. The food I saw (and ate) was very generic Italian food that you could get anywhere (and wtf--Italian food at ""Jardin"" Nelson?). In retrospect I should have ordered the crepes, they looked better and might be more solid choices. The nachos were an interesting choice (ordered by a colleague). If you're in the mood for nachos and a beer, it's a decent choice (but again, nachos at ""Jardin"" Nelson?). The desert portions looked to be very generous, especially the crepes. Everything on the menu seemed too expensive for what you get, but this might be typical for Montreal (my first trip here)."

We sat in the courtyard and our waitress Pascale was fun, spunky and knowledgable. She helped us enjoy our stay and made us feel relaxed. We enjoyed the rosé sangria. It's a must. Most people ordered the melon sangria. We tried it as one of our neighboring tables was generous to share a sample. It was overly sweet and screamed hangover central. The rosé sangria was just perfect. The right amount of sweet and boozy. We also tried the port one too. It was not sweet at all even though it was a port wine. We drank the second pitcher from this choice. As an appetizer we enjoyed the Quebec cheeses: delicious. For main courses I had the duck with salad. It was so delectable. For dessert we shared a cheesecake crepe that was unreal. The jazz band was lively and a great added bonus. The atmosphere is very chill with birds chirping and beautiful flowers.  We were told not to bother going but I'm so glad we didn't listen. We will return and recommend others to enjoy it.

I kind of expected better of this place!Overall service was pretty good, but a bit slow.  Perhaps they were short staffed as it is nearing the end of the season, but my friend did wait about 20 minutes for her dessert to come out- and it was just sorbet.Go primarily for the atmosphere, and don't have super high expectations about the food- you won't be disappointed!"

There were lots of plants and the atmosphere was casual yet classy. I came with a group of 7, which was great because we got to order different dishes and try each other's meal. After much deliberation between the rabbit crepe or the duck salad, I finally settled on the duck leg confit and salad, which was both beautifully presented and delicious as well. I tried my friends French onion soup, which was a very generous portion. It was very cheesy and a little heavy for me, but still very tasty! I also tried my friends seafood crepe which I found creamy and yummy. My other friend really enjoyed her salmon salad - it was very light and served with julienned leeks, rice vermicelli (and other things) Service was very good as well.My only complaints are that I wish we could've been seated closer to the music (we could barely hear it), but it's understandable that we weren't because we were a pretty large party and seats were limited. I also feel that in my mind, I may have built up the food too much, because while it was delicious, it wasn't fantastically amazing (as I had imagined it to be in my head)Still, the food is good, staff is friendly, and LOVE the garden - such a lovely setting - will definitely be back (probably with a smaller party so I can sit closer to the Jazz music)"

The place itself is very beautiful, the ambiance is lovely and the Jazz playing in the background makes it a perfect weekend brunch setting. The downside - both the dishes that we ordered were bland. We were warned that the food is not what people go o Jardin Nelson for. The service also was very poor. It wasn't very busy when we were there but it took our server forever to get water. It's good to check out on a visit to Montreal but we'd never go back again!"

The menu is very extensive, lots of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and crepes. Definitely recommend the CINQ FROMAGES PIZZA. If you're in a pizza mood, get it. You won't regret it, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten in my life. Spinach salad with strawberries and maple dressing was very nice and light and sweet. The goat cheese pastry appetizer was also fantastic.Heard this place is a bit of a ""tourist trap"" and I can say that as a tourist I did get trapped by this place and it was totally worth it. Best food I've had so far in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=zE49S2Em3l7vgIlvFzZFOw,Jenny H.,"Pembroke, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here mostly for the environment. If you go during a busy time, you likely will need to wait outside for 30 minutes or so. You have the option to dine in the centre of the restaurant - which is where all the flowers, decor and jazz music is. But you can also choose to sit towards outside facing Old Port. Sitting outside will shorten your wait time. Once my friends and I got a table (centre), we were overwhelmed (in a good way), by the beauty of the surrounding. It's probably one of the most romantic restaurants I've been to.  You are surrounded by colorful flowers, with mini tents above your table and heaters (during winter). The Jazz band is situated in the middle floor (there are  3 open floors), and almost everyone could pretty much see them. Do note, that there are potentially small birds here and there. It adds to the garden feel. I ordered the Sweet Folie Salad, lasagna and the Nelson Crepe. The food itself was okay. It was not bad, but not amazing either. I think the most unique was the Nelson Crepe - I remember bacon, maple syrup. Perhaps I need to return and order other products. But based on what I've tried, it's alright. Service was okay. They are quick about getting you in, but also quick about getting you out. Perhaps it's because they were packed that night."

First it was suppose to be spicy!!! lol...a baby can handle this as there was no spice. Then I kept waiting for the curry and waiting and waiting....No curry taste but at the end in the middle. 1 star  for the food 5 star for the ambiance. Would I go back.

French onion soup best I've ever eaten, shrimp over a red pepper sauce very good (cold shrimp like in shrimp cocktail), baby spinach with strawberry salad excellent. The French dip beef was very good, au jus touch of liquor. Only disappointment was the chicken crepe, very mediocre.   Also, rolls are typical restaurant rolls, nothing at all imaginative (would definitely suggest to the owners something better, more unique, maybe a baked bread, or at least heat these standard rolls).Overall, great place and meal."

/user_details?userid=w8dy-ibFrNXBfA-TdQDCIQ,Maria S.,"Holden Beach, NC",4 star rating,"Jardin Nelson is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal. We stopped in on a very hot, very busy holiday weekend during the Montreal Jazz Festival. My advice--don't be impatient and sit inside or in the front. Wait in line (it moves fast) for a table on the back terrace, where mammoth hanging planters filled with gorgeous blooms filter the sunlight and offer respite from the heat. The service is fast, friendly, and efficient; the staff definitely knows how to manage a busy scene. And the jazz combo playing softly in the background is a nice touch.The main menu section features more than a dozen different crepes. I had the Jardin, which is a corn and sesame crepe filled with fresh, seasonal veggies, olives, and goat cheese. Delicious! My husband opted for the French Dip, which was heaped with savory roast beef sandwiched between amazing French bread--crusty on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. The dipping sauce and horseradish sides added great flavor, and the frites were pretty darn good too!Because we had an hour's drive ahead of us, we couldn't try any of the drink specials, but the pitchers of house-made Sangria passing us every few minutes looked like the ideal remedy for the hot summer weather."

We sat in the back courtyard, which had a great atmosphere - a really intimate feel and off the busy main square of Old Montreal. Since we were traveling with our toddler, being outdoors was perfect, and the wait staff was very accommodating. I had the chicken and broccoli crepe and really enjoyed it. My husband had a bacon and apple crepe which was also good. The white sangria was excellent and seemed like  a popular drink as most tables had the same. I'd recommend going early if you don't want to wait. When we were leaving there was a long line for both the front of the restaurant and the back courtyard. Definitely a popular place in Old Montreal."

Our table location took away from the atmosphere though.  We sat right on the edge of a patio, where we saw the line building at the hostess stand.  The entire meal felt rushed, from watching the impatient line building to the delivery of our food and check.  Don't expect to lounge on the terrace enjoying cocktails.That's OK though, the mojito I had could have been better.The food was good:  I had the Roast Beef sandwich with horseradish.  The sandwich was a fair portion, and the roast beef was tender.  The sandwich came with fries, which weren't anything special.  My husband had the Charcuterie Pizza.  The crust was good, but he was disappointed in the pizza's toppings:  each quarter of the pizza had a different topping, rather than the four toppings on the entire pizza.  It seemed skimpy.  I think our two entrees, a cocktail, and a beer totaled around $60.I just wasn't impressed with Jardin Nelson. I can accept overpriced restaurants in touristy areas, but there's no excuse for subpar food, drinks, and service."

Why did everything taste the same now? -The worst by far was the foresteire..the worst crepe I have ever had.

It tasted fresh and was quite good.The mains were, for me, a duck confit salad, bursting with flavour from the glaze and juicy duck meat. The poppy dressing could have been from a jar but the salad was very good nonetheless.

Sadly they're closed in the winter, probably because it's hard to get people to eat in an open air restaurant when it's -30 outside, go figure.

It's a gem in Old Montreal and even though it was cold and wet outside it felt special once you enter the gardens at the back and sit under the heaters. The charcuterie platter is incredible with so many flavors. My honey ordered the shrimp in red sauce and he enjoyed that appetizer too. He had the seafood crepe and said great things about it and he finished with the apple crepe for dessert. I enjoyed the feta and watermelon salad and asked the chef to change out the pork for grilled chicken. The salad is more berries than salad, it was interesting. It's a cute spot, make a reservation as it apparently has an incredible line down the street in the summer months. It doesn't take reservations for dinner, only lunch and they only answer the phone between 11.30 - 12 each day for reservations (weird) but worth it."

While that was pretty good, unfortunately my crêpe was just sad. The Florentine consisted of a buckwheat and hemp batter and a spinach, ham and brie cheese filling. This was served with a side of some sort of slaw with dried cranberries. The slaw needed a bit more acidity, in my opinion, but the crêpe was what was truly disappointing. The actual crêpe itself was just too thin and salty, but the FILLING. Dear god, why on earth would anyone would put that much filling inside?? Not to mention that it was too salty. My friend's Basilico crêpe was also the same: too much filling, too salty, crêpe batter wasn't on point. We were both pretty disappointed. I realize that sometimes you just happen to order ""the wrong thing"", but I really expect a restaurant like this to be solid across the menu."

I was not disappointed.The location in the Old Port is convenient for tourists like me and upon wing into the outdoor dining area it felt like I had discovered a secret garden. The decor is beautiful, with a few tiers of terraces, a small stage, and lots of greens and flowers.The ambiance is wonderful and both romantic and family friendly. I was able to visit on a night with a live jazz band.I knew they were famous for their crepes, so I ordered the duck crepe. The waitstaff was very friendly and our waitress was extremely attentive and even started a pleasant conversation about the arts with us.The food was the highlight of my trip to Montreal, he best meal I had while I was there. The idea of duck in a crepe is not nearly as mouthwatering as the actual dish served to me. I wish this restaurant was close to home.Mid-meal, it started pouring but the outdoor area was equipped with rain catchers that feed into their plants so we stayed dry the entire meal.There's definitely something especially romantic about spending my birthday night dining in an enclosed garden, in Montreal, in the rain.Half a year later and I'm still reaching about this place to everyone I know and I am looking forward to another visit."

The ambience is wonderful with the wonderful jazz and exterior, the staff was really nice and friendly,service was relatively fast considering how it was always fully packed, and their food  no words. Our group of 3 shared the estivale salad (refreshing, perfect blend of fruit and veggies and delicious dressing) and the du Marche pizza (really good vegetarian pizza with doughy crust). We also had the lemon rosemary chicken wings for an appetizer. Sharing left us contently full with enough room for dessert! Definitely recommend the orange tiramisu: the orange isn't overpowering and it's creamy but not soggy.

Apparently this is a routine thing here, as I didn't see any other host ask for customers' names.

He got us two cups, we politely refused one and took just one cup (I am pretty sure I ordered just one cup). Me and wife shared coffee from that one cup as we always do.

We loved it so much we went back twice in one weekend.  Recommend:the Riojathe cidercheese plateFrench Onion Soupmushroom crepe, (the radish slaw served with the crepes is SO good!).  The fish gravlax was a little bland but the salad with it was great.  The chicken liver pate was good but the onion confit was far too sweet.  Prices are on the high side but you are also paying for a lovely and relaxed atmosphere - consider it a tip for the ever present live jazz.  Service excellent and I have to give props to our server who ever so deftly suggested that there was wine by the glass after 3 of us polished off our second bottle.  A classy way to cut us off.  I wonder if the fact that my friend was posing with the ramekins over her eyes was a hint that we'd had too much?"

Everyone worries the dropping will drop into their dishes, although everyone probably loves birds in nature.- MEDICORE dishes. We ordered 3 different items, only salad turned out to be OK. Even pizza does not taste good.- Rude waiter. When I asked for 1 minute to get my family from outside restaurant to the table in the garden, the reply was ""I cannot trust you, and we have limited space"".  And the waiter clean the table setting and ""invite me out"".  We did come back in 1 minute.-- I won't call the waiter a LIAR, but there were 10+ open tables during my entire stay there.- Entitlement of tips, which was the highlight, and quite amusing. A small notice was given along with the bill to every customer, saying ""outstanding service"" deserves 15% tips.   Tips are to be earned, and customers, not the restaurant, are in the position to judge the quality of service.In a word, nice to see the place, but unpleasant to dine!"

I got the diva crepe, which was a savory affair with cheese, chicken, broccoli and a bechamel sauce of some sort. It tasted great! The crepe was done well, and gave off that freshly baked scent with every bite, as the ingredients oozed out. I also got a glass of the house lemonade (lemonade maison), which was an interesting take on lemonade. I think they mixed lemon juice with soda water, and then blended it with bits of basil! It was a very refreshing taste, with a hint of herbal fragrance and a slight bitterness from the soda.The other half of the joy of dining here is the atmosphere. The courtyard is a really amazing place to sit. There are flowers planted on the walls surrounding it, and off-center, there was a little water feature. A live jazz duo (comprising a bassist and a pianist) was playing when I got there."

I can honestly say that the food didn't disappoint, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. Good, Tasty, satisfying - yes. Anything unusual or unique - not so much. Pricewise, they were decent too, so no regrets.Their most prized perk, however, is the inside garden. When we got there, there was a ton of people in line waiting to get there. They don't take reservations for dinner, so you can't really avoid this, if you want to visit that garden. It looked very nice and intimate with live music (I think they have that few times a week), but it also felt somewhat hot and stuffy there, despite the size and trees in the area. We opted out for outside patio facing the busy pedestrian square, and didn't regret it - you can enjoy nice weather while being covered from elements and do a lot of people watching. All and all - I would recommend them for good decently priced food in a nice setting and perfect location. However, there are a lot of more interesting and unusual places around."

/user_details?userid=F2cMAsmFfxT1iy92fVCmFw,Gary H.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"When you come across a place at the Nexus of all tourists on foot, one is wary about what you will get in a restaurant.  Thankfully Jardin Nelson does not fit the stereotypical tourist trap.  It was actually a truly  enjoyable find.  The atmosphere is great.  We were hoping to sit out front on the patio, but we ended up inside which turned out to be a real treat.  The 3 piece jazz group was outstanding, the birds whistling around throughout the meal was fun and the feeling sitting outside surrounded by the old walls of days gone by was special.The service, while very friendly, is not overly fast.  It took sometime to finally get someone to show up.  Very personable and engaged but it took over 10-15 minutes to get the glass of wine and at least another 5 before the water appeared.  After another 5-10 minutes or so we finally received a basket of bread.The food followed shortly after the bread and it ranged from very good(Tex Mex pizza) to an okay crepe (whole wheat curry chicken and cheese).  The pizza was very flavourful.  The crust was nicely done.  A bit pricey at $16.95 for a single serving pizza but I guess that's the price you pay for the heart of Vieux Montreal.  The curry chicken crepe was not overfly flavourful, very mild on the curry, and a bit dry (perhaps the whole wheat crepe wasn't compensated for, i.e soaks up all the sauce).  The side of slaw was a nice counter balance to the curry.  We asked for the 'house' hot oil, made with habanero peppers.  That really helped enhance the flavours and while we were warned it was really really hot, I found it just had a nice little zing.Overall a good experience.  A bit pricey for what you get.  Get here early though (before 6:30) as the line gets very long."

It was heavenly! The crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety, but it definitely works.

I am really not sure about vanilla and veal blanquette (what is it with you and vanilla, people?).The duck shepherd's pie (paté chinois) was disappointingly bland, barely saved by the really good home made ketchup and beets that were served on the side.The check finished to kill the experience: 100$ for two for just starters and entrées, no dessert, three drinks (no wine) and an espresso, that's a bit steep.We had a really good time, but this place (restaurant?) has absolutely nothing to do with it.I guess it's an OK place for a drink with friends.

I am well aware that this is my first here. Their blatant discriminatory practice forced me to do so. My husband and I were on our honeymoon. While touring Vieux Montreal we decided to find an establishment to dine, wine and hear some jazz. Jardin seemed to have some decent reviews. It was too be an early dinner on a Monday in August. The place was not yet crowed. Upon entering, my husband, who is white and me who is black Haitian, were directed to a table in the back. As the place was not crowded and we noted a few families with young children around our intended section, we politely asked to be seated upstairs. The hostess paused and almost reluctantly took us up the stairs to a quieter section that seemed to have been reserved for more desired clientele. I should note that upon coming in we did see a black family seated off the side near the front entrance. The clientele around us were all white and seemingly of the Fifth Avenue/ Rue Sherbrooke type. I should note that my husband and I are professionals who could hold are own too. However, it seems that we were the wrong combination platter. To make a long story short, we sat at our upstairs table,  with menu in hands, for over 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the empty tables around us where beginning to fill up with the right clientele who were immediately given water and their drinks of choice. My husband and I waited. Five different waiters passed us to see to the needs of others. A woman,  who we later found out was the manager, even saw us sitting there and went about doing other things. I knew something was us but said nothing, not even to my husband; least i be branded the angry black woman. Finally my husband, who is usually the first to err on the side of goodness,  noted the blatant oversight. He asked a passing server to see a manager. When the manager arrived she gave an excuse about the changing in staff. We then noted that people who can after us were already handled. She apologize perfunctorily, but failed to acknowledged the blatant oversight by her staff. I then said her excuses are unacceptable. I said this situation merits a review. She then waived us away and says, ""well go ahead and write your review"". It was embarrassing as other guest had noted the blatant neglect too. As we walked out, we saw a new girl at the stand who wished us a good day. We briefly explained we had not eaten and why. She apologized, but the damage was done. My poor husband was apologetic and nearly tearful. I explained to him this is the perils of being black in an Anglo Franco World. We took a taxi back to our hotel. We will not do Vieux Montreal again. The area restaurants don't really welcome diversity. The discrimination at the Jardin Nelson was systemic. Don't waste your money in that pretty poison."

If I remember correctly, most of the savory crepes run in the $16 range.  We were there for lunch and enjoyed the pottage du jour (a broth based vegetable soup), the Pizza American (personal size pizza with cheese and pepperoni) and my husband had the Roast beef au jous which he enjoyed. The service was good although rather impersonal.  They had an excellent live band who played a lot of the standards and some Nora Jones hits.

It was raining what we went, but the upside down umbrellas catch the rain to keep you dry. There are a couple places where the rain enters the patio area but it isn't a big deal and it is kinda fun to watch the servers walking with umbrellas so not to get your food wet. Service: The service was some of the best I have ever received. They were friendly and accommodating. I asked to have the forest crepe with something other than the chicken sauce that came with it and they didn't have a problem with this. Food: Delicious and eye-appealing. Price: I said that it is costly... and it is... but it is not too over the top. It was actually cheaper than the hotel I was staying at.

The Basilico had chicken and pesto on a crepe made with corn batter (didn't know that existed, but it added a lot to the flavor). The duck crepe had a very nice citrus note. And you can't really go wrong with banana chocolate crepe for dessert. Service was unobtrusive, English-friendly and timely, but I wouldn't go here with 6+ if you're on a tight schedule.

My dad (who's in his mid 70's), did not make a huge fuss however he was quite cold the rest of the evening and obviously rather uncomfortable sitting in a pair of corduroys that were soaked through.The waitress apologized profusely and as water had spilled on his entrée as well, she had the kitchen make a new order.  However when the bill came, I expected to see some sort of acknowledgement of the inconvenience....right?  Wrong.  Fully charged for every item ordered.  I was completely shocked.  I eat out a lot and when accidents happen, the establishment usually backs their staff up somehow - desserts on the house, drinks or at the very least, the dinner of the person this happened to.  My dad chose to give her the full 15% tip which I would've agreed with had this incident been acknowledged but nothing was - hence the review.  Food was good.  Atmosphere was good. Customer relations = 0.  Surprising given that the restaurant is located in a tourist area where you would think customer service and hospitality are of utmost importance.  But then again, it's obvious that these guys are not looking to nurture return business in any way nor are they concerned about competitive business.  I for one, will not be back and will not offer a recommendation.  Montreal has a TON of fantastic restaurants in great neighbourhoods all around the city - there is certainly nothing here that can't be enjoyed elsewhere where the level of customer appreciation is exercised and shown at a level befitting the establishment and its' environs."

The calamari portion was cute (meaning not large), enough for my wife though. Unfortunately they serve it with a kind of spicy Thai-like sauce instead of a good garlic remoulade as it is usually served in Europe. But the calamari were good even with simple mayo we asked for.

I had a crepe...which was plain...I thought they were known for their crepes but all crepes looked plain. I should have gotten what my friend had...the egg dish...which looked like it was in a casserole...MMmmmI was eying some guy who got a HUGE French onion soup. It looked like twice the normal size. Should have gotten one. Get that French Onion Soup!!!

Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!We tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the ""pudding chomeur,"" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!The service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party ""start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,"" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones. Overall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!"

Before our drinks even came there was a bird pooping onto our table but the staff couldn't care less (perhaps because we're an ""ethnic"" family). Both the wait staff, and someone, who I assume is the manager, were extremely rude and very unapologetic. Sure, they couldn't do anything about the bird, but they could have, at the very least, let us move the table slightly, to avoid unwanted filth falling directly into our food and drinks. After a long while of this absurdity, the staff (very reluctantly), moved us to another table (inside this time). By this point though, this place had completely ruined our mood, both by the staff's deliberate avoidance of our issues, and their continued insolence. As a party of 7, we ordered a variety of dishes. Again, the food was not only subpar, but actually unenjoyable. In fact, we all concluded that we had had substantially better food elsewhere. Overall, not going back. Somehow, their blatant ignorance of our concerns during the service, and the unapologetic 'gtfo' attitude towards us (and to no other patrons present there at the time) is quite evident of a very bigotedly racist attitude embodied in this rather unremarkable eatery. As a paying customer, it's disappointing to be treated as a 'lesser person' in this day and age."

/user_details?userid=6jrAyaDfuVIKKzUE4ro6ZQ,Donna C.,"Snoqualmie, WA",5 star rating,"My husband and I were big fans of this place, not only for the great food, service, and jazz but for the experience as a whole. We sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a Friday night) and marveled at the design of the place. The giant, umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers. The south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden. The sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic evening.Now the food: we started with the Estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course, had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe. The pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there! The crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal).For dessert, we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible. It was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectly.One of the things I really liked seeing was that on the comment card, there was a question for rating price/quality ratio. Indeed, this place had an excellent price/quality ratio! They could easily charge more, for the setting, for the jazz, for the food but they don't. Very respectable!For a perfect romantic summer evening, this is it! Highly recommended. We would totally go back."

I tried a Boreal Red on the strength of our servers suggestion and it was a great beer. I wish I would have brought back a 6 pack or five with me.The menu had nice offerings but we all went for crepes.  I tried the Pork cutlet crepe and it was really good.  The crepe was cooked well and not overly goopy and cheesey. The flavor was aiming for Greek and they got it right on the money with the red onion, spinach and yogurt sauce.  I've only hade crepes one time before but so far, its Jardin Nelson 1, other place 0. My companions also enjoyed their crepes, and being vegetarians, they had choices galore.The ambiance in the rear seating area was nice.

I noticed multiple tables with unfilled drinks and frustrated patrons. It took atleast 20 minutes to get our bill and after that he ran our card 4 times before he was able to provide the final bill which ending up triggering a fraud alert with our credit card company.

After some back and forth, I convinced her that we would prefer to stay at the nice table; and a moment later they did indeed  open that section. Ten minutes later, the manager passed by, a rude middle-aged women. She saw the cake on the table and started yelling at the waitress in French, explaining that it was against their policy to allow outside food. When bride and groom got visibly upset, I asked the manager to be a bit accommodating and speak to us in a polite and professional manner. She didn't change her attitude and made us pack the cake again. By then, the bunch was spoilt. No words of apologies, no smile, no congratulations.

But we visited Jardin Nelson with our young son. From the get-go, our waiter was rude about everything that had to do with our son. We asked for a side of roasted potatoes, but apparently they couldn't be separated from the roast beef sandwich. Then the waiter brought our son cold pasta. The manager was quick to try to fix the situation and even brought us dessert on the house. All three of us really enjoyed the atmosphere, the live jazz and the outdoor seating. The bacon and apple crepe, and sangria were delicious. It's too bad this place is not child-friendly."
