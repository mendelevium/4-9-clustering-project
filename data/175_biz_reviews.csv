/user_details?userid=JtVH_3wrry7s-odKjts73A,Jenny Z.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Really loved this place! Came for a long weekend trip with a couple of friends, and arrived Friday night STARVING and exhausted after a long drive. Yum Yum was extremely accommodating and stayed open late just for us! The food was delicious and filling, and incredibly affordable. They had great specials on drinks too. We were staying just down the road from Yum Yum, and found ourselves back multiple times during that one weekend (one guy ate there 3 times in less than 48 hours!). Most importantly, they are kind and welcoming, the food is great, and the kitchen looks spotless!"
/user_details?userid=FFCBTsP3oL9c5YTOcJnXpA,Tricia C.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"I haven't done reviews in awhile but this place convinced me I needed to get on and do some for my recent trip.We were actually walking to a french restaurant for my birthday dinner when we passed a few dumpling spots on our way.  This one caught our eye because we love soup dumpings and while yes we have them in Dallas, they're not great.  So we said ""let's just get one order and then go to the other expensive restaurant and not have to spend so much""...well as soon as I tried #117 (pork & shrimp xiao long bao) I knew that's what I wanted to eat for my birthday dinner!  We slurped em up and ordered more and never bothered with the other restaurant.It seems to be a family run place and the server probably could have used a little help but I was shocked there aren't more reviews! Please go give them a try.  I do wish they had fresh ginger dipping sauce to offer (when we asked for ginger they just gave us pickled sushi ginger) but other than that I'd eat these every day!"

Delicious !! Thanks !  Délicieux Dumplings ! J'ai goûté les soupe Dumplings bœuf et oignons et les Dumplings bœuf coriandre avec en entrée des rouleaux de printemps frits. Tout était délicieux, livré avec Uber Eats, à température parfaite ! Amazing dumplings, I ordered on Uber eats, soup dumplings beef onions, dumplings beef coriander and spring rolls.

/user_details?userid=kbHkMCQPrrgIKMgjUeMP_g,Kristin F.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",4 star rating,"Summary: a cute little restaurant serving some yummy Chinese food, especially their soup dumplings! Dumplings are made fresh and they offer a variety of different fillings. Their ingredients are so fresh!My husband and I were walking down the street one night and stumbled upon this place. From their front sign, it seems like they opened not too long ago as they offered grand opening specials. We ordered soup dumplings, one order for each of us (each order comes with 10 dumplings!). Each order came with a choice of an egg roll or wonton soup. I had the wonton soup and it was cleansing and not overly salty. My husband said the egg roll was alright. The soup dumplings were delicious and you can really tell that the cook uses fresh ingredients. Other soup dumplings I've had, they are always very salty. Yum Yum's dumplings are just right for my taste after dipping or pouring on some vinegar. Highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=HQ4qREUvJnQku5kOPENnLg,Yihsuan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for a take out. I ordered pork\shrimp soup dumpling and fried rice. Overall I think it's a decent restaurant, soup dumpling is good, but not at the very top level comparing with all the good soup dumplings I've tried in the very first store of Din-Tai-Feng in Taiwan and all others back in Asia. Fried rice is not as impressive, I wasn't amazed but not unhappy about the order. I would say it a good place to visit when you have homesick or just want some Asian-proofed Asian food. ;)"

The place it's self is okay, but the food is amazing! the people in there are very friendly and welcoming. A few minutes after we ordered, the waiter came back and told us that they were quite busy so we might have to wait a bit longer than usual. We were okay with that, and it was totally worth the wait! (We got our food within 15 minutes). We had different soup dumplings and they very all so tasty and so delicious! As you walk in to the restaurant you can see how they make the dumplings, because it is an open kitchen. Super cool! I would definitely go here again - I might even go there again tomorrow!"
/user_details?userid=Tahzf2iL7XtENbfrFjbG3Q,Little Mac M.,"Seal Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Annie is the best waitress; she is super friendly and the foods are delicious!  Its dumplings are far better than Ding Tai Fung in ARCADIA, CA, USA, where people diners willing to wait 2 to 3 hours to dine its restaurant chain.  If you are planning to visit Montréal, this is a must enjoy."
/user_details?userid=DnLnHd4mHJxujYEa_ntnZA,Nicole N.,"Baltimore, MD",5 star rating,"We had walked past this restaurant and saw people eating great food so we decided to come back the next day for dinner. That's when we found out its actually a new restaurant! But oh man, so delicious everything they make it homemade. The noodles and dumplings are extra tasty. The service was very friendly. I will definitely be going back or ordering in!"
/user_details?userid=ej9GnKgdlRDnt8YzcINDpw,Larsie M.,"Kingston, NY",5 star rating,"This restaurant knocked our socks off. We had the soup dumplings, laksa and Hong Kong milk tea. Everything was delicious and the folks who run it are super sweet. They even make their own hot sauce - we bought a jar to take home with us. The food is so reasonably priced; if I lived in Montreal I would go here every week."
/user_details?userid=3dcE-GM70iLvI2ySTZBplw,Jenni W.,"West End, Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"I will be back to Montreal just for this restaurant. These were the best soup dumplings I have ever had and the staff was very friendly. If you are even considering dumplings, come here! You will not be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=EdgV57aWQNyu2GfKuNLU5Q,Brad F.,"Burlington, NC",5 star rating,Great find in Montreal.  Go for the soup dumplings... fantastic!!! Staff was friendly and helped me select menu items. House made hot oil served at table with dumplings.  Great on a cold evening.

/user_details?userid=xZ7FIGYd9_nYdU5R7RSfPA,Caelan M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Waited forever to be seated and the place was dead. Took an hour to be served EDAMAME. And it was cold. I don't know how edamame could possibly take an hour. Food was served for everyone at different times and one of the waiters made my friend eat a dumping in front of him while it was boiling hot. Like he stood by the table and wouldn't leave until she took a bite. It was comically bad. Also the food was so salty I've been chugging water the entire night. Don't go. You're welcome.
/user_details?userid=9cUmmw-pHEmB1-hydXBZIw,Ilan K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is great! Brand new family business. Great food, very friendly service. We were staying at an Airbnb nearby and went three times in 24 hours. They kept it open for us past closing, as well as gave us a tour of the kitchen (incredibly clean). Would recommend!! Delicious."
