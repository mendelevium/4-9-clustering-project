/user_details?userid=DQ-sNY_J0Dp_adIu0jnu_A,Bella N.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"Stopped by on my poutine tour of Montreal! I appreciated how it was a comfortable dining space with plenty of seating. Service was standard, staff was efficient, prices are fair. I tried the House Special Poutine, and felt that it was good but not impressive. It was a little too salty for me, and I think the gravy didn't have as much umami as it could have had. I might also have preferred to do fries over smashed potatoes. Overall still think it's worth checking out this place for the fact that you can customize your own poutine on top of their already extensive list of options (and perhaps I just didn't have the greatest luck when I stopped by?)."

Our waiter was so nice and accommodating. We ordered a bunch of poutines to share including: general tso, French, Poutineville and blue dragon (buffalo). All were amazing! My favorite was French- it tasted like French onion soup. The lychee sangria was BOMB.com like amazing! This is a must when in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=5X9op_99I_b1VlsrkzsgAw,Spencer Y.,"Rockville, MD",5 star rating,"Going into Montreal, I was told that the two things I needed to try were smoked meat and poutine. Through some research on Yelp, I figured I'd give this a try.I personally am not a fan of french fries smothered with gravy and covered with toppings, but I wanted to have a true Montreal experience. That being said, I think they dishes were well made. especially the Indian poutine that comes with butter chicken. I was surprised they executed a cultural dish so well. The poutineville classic was decent. Overall, I'd want to try more of their cultural dishes like China poutine.The ambiance was nice with decent private bathrooms. The service was a little slow but not bad at all. Overall a solid choice for cultural poutine options."
/user_details?userid=KozoBTm9_mTRxtS7CTl4Ag,Jasmine L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Who doesn't love poutine ?? I ordered the Smoked Meat Poutine ($13 regular size). It's a super savoury & hearty dish that isn't shy on the portions. There was a broiled layer of cheese over delicious gravy lava covering the crispy fries, smoked meat bits & mushroom. Served pipping hot & all the components were in a perfect ratio in my opinion! Keep in mind this specific poutine didn't have the 'squeaky' cheese curds.. I'll definitely try another poutine of theirs with them in the future!"

I went to Poutineville for an early dinner while vacationing in Montreal. We were seated immediately after entering the restaurant. Poutineville has signature poutine dishes or you can customize your own. I ordered general Tao poutine (general Tao chicken on crushed potatoes, fresh cheese curds, and sweet & spicy sauce). This was my first time eating poutine. The poutine was really tasty.  All of the ingredients blended well together. Poutineville has a nice ambience. Service was decent. Poutineville is a good choice for poutine in Montreal."

My favourite part was how quickly the food came out - I suppose if all your make is poutine, and your customers order poutine, you'd better be ready - but I was impressed all the same. Right amount of cheese curds, good gravy: I would o back! Not the best poutine I have ever had, and the wait staff changed chicks halfway through our experience so we got forgotten, hence the four stars - but still very good!"
/user_details?userid=PALLpd-wFfmp48inCockgg,Shaun Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I had been to this restaurant twice and had a good impression of their red wine beef poutine. It is the favourite poutine restaurant of my friend in Montreal but personally I prefer La Banquise. Their poutine looks fancier and has the restaurant style but I like the simplicity and snack style of poutine at La Banquise.
/user_details?userid=rYcX_4HVmNZhC_xHWga6kQ,Rob H.,"Southwest Calgary, Calgary, Canada",3 star rating,"My girlfriend had never tried poutine so during a recent trip to Montreal we decided to order from Poutineville after reading all of the great reviews. We ordered the Poutineville and The Montrealer as well as a Ceasar Salad. I'll give it to them that the Poutineville (crushed potatoes, cheese curds, mozzarella, braised beef, and red wine sauce) was awesome but the other two items we had just weren't good at all. The Ceasar salad was so overdressed that you could barely locate the lettuce. This is coming from someone that tends to like lots of sauce or dressing, it was just far too much. The Montrealer poutine just didn't seem to work at all. I think the way to go at this place is have their crushed potatoes instead of french fries. I'd go back and try some other things here because there is obvious potential."

Their service is absolutely fantastic. Super friendly staff and just wonderful people. You get a little checklist and customize your own poutine. We ordered normal fries with gravy, cheese curds, onions, mushrooms, and corn. It was absolutely heavenly. Yes, 17$ is a bit much for poutine, but the portion for a large is enormous. Easily feeds 2+ people. There was a perfect ratio of all of the ingredients. They did not skimp on the gravy or cheese."
/user_details?userid=h-DpyI9KyRd32uQCfa8ktQ,Shamik M.,"Garden City, NY",5 star rating,"Excellent poutine, the crushed fries are super crispy and the added surface area of the rough surface picks up more gravy than the usual fries.

/user_details?userid=ldS3GeShxTm4Kk2WS3jnHQ,Sneha S.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"I was in Montreal this past weekend and my family insisted that we try poutine before we leave, it's one of those things you have to check off the list. We went to La Banquise first, took one look at the giant line up and decided we'd go to Poutineville instead. It was around 2pm on a Sunday and there was no wait and our group of 8 got seated immediately.The person that greeted us at the door was quite rude when we asked how long the wait was.. but our server was very nice and answered all our questions politely. Poutineville's menu is quite extensive with not only pre-made poutines on the menu; they also have sandwiches, burgers and salads. There's also an option to create a custom poutine on a little slip of paper with checkboxes. (French on one side, English on the other). The custom option has so many different options within each category, I'm sure everyone can find something they're looking for. There's 4 different types of fries, 4-6 types of gravies (most of which are vegetarian!), 5-6 types of cheese, around 10-15 veggies and 10-15 meats. We got one custom poutine, one vegetarian pizza poutine, one vegetarian sandwich with fries and one Mexican poutine. Everything was good! The poutines came to the table hot (except the Mexican bc it had sour cream, guacamole and salsa). The pizza poutine was my favourite just because of the flavour combinations. The cheese and peppers and mushrooms worked so well together with the fries as base. I enjoyed the custom poutine as well, the crushed potatoes were sooo good. I wish it was a little spicier though but they had a spicy 911 gravy that I might try if I ever find myself at Poutineville again. All the food was given in generous portions and we couldn't finish any of it. The server offered to pack it up for us without any hesitation. I'd definitely revisit Poutineville during another Montreal trip in the future!"

/user_details?userid=khDU0BwZl1PZMwleTje89Q,Amy W.,"Smyrna, GA",4 star rating,"In town visiting friends and they insisted this be the first place we try. It's their favorite poutine supplier. On the table we had the smoked meat, maple mac (a seasonal special), & the filet mignon. My favorite was the filet mignon and i think it was the blue cheese in with the regular cheese curds mixing with the caramelized onion & 3 pepper gravy on that particular dish. The smoked meat includes mushrooms and swiss, but i thought the swiss took away from the cheese curd flavor, and i felt like there wasn't enough sauce. The maple mac was lacking in maple in my opinion but i only had a few bites. The biggest recommendation i can give about this place is subbing the crushed potatoes on any dish you get. Some already come with it, but definitely get those instead of the fries if it doesn't. Everyone got the regular size, which is plenty. Definitely will try again for more poutine interations when we are back!"
/user_details?userid=AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,Sherwin C.,"Wheeling, IL",4 star rating,"Delicious poutine. This would be a solid choice for anyone's first experience with poutine (though you might be disappointed at the lack of selection and quality that other restaurants will offer).You can order any poutine here as the meats are tender and flavorful, and all of them come with a generous base of flavorful, crispy, hot fries. The best way to enjoy the crispiness of the fries though would be to get a side without the gravy and toppings as this is worth a visit to the restaurant alone. Unlike other restaurants which may treat the gravy as an afterthought, this gravy is complex and full of flavor -- definitely showing the amount of care and amount of quality ingredients that goes into developing a divine flavor.Be aware that it's crowded and difficult to find parking in the area but it is worth it to get a delicious poutine experience at fair prices."

We settled on poutinevile and ordered the namesake variant.Awesome parts:- the poutine itself was excellent in flavor. The ingredients really added up to a satisfying dish- the signature crushed potatoes were delicious and a standout. While not the most traditional, this is such a welcomed innovation! Could be improved:- probably not the restaurants fault but very crowded and the tables were close together. We sat at a table by a speaker so we had a very loud experience- we ordered the house salad with the poutine and have to call this one a dish to skip. The salad was coated in coleslaw and could use more lettuce"

Then came the food. I ordered the Poutineville. If the entire restaurant was named after this dish then I HAD to try it. It's a basic poutine but with braised beef and a little red wine added to their basic sauce. When I say yum....that doesn't even begin to describe the experience. One other unique thing was that they offer poutine with smashed fries. DO IT!"

I get excited when people from out of town visit because it's an excuse for me to go. The location is kind of in a ""dead zone,"" as one of the waitresses put it, but it's not too far of a walk from Beri UQAM and they're open late!The crushed potatoes are really the best. They stay crispy despite whatever toppings are on top, just so much surface area. Whatever I get, I always substitute the crushed potatoes if they don't come with them. My top two are the House Special (braised beef + red wine gravy, so good) and the Montrealer (smoked meat, mushrooms, swiss cheese, fried pickle.) They're both amazing! My husband thinks the Montrealer is definitely #1, but if I could I would get half of each every time. The other ones I've tried: The Godfather (eggplant, italian sausage, roasted peppers, meat sauce)Zeus (feta, gyro meat, tomatoes)Hangover Cure (bacon, sausage, beef, fried egg)Hawgstown (pulled pork, bbq sauce, corn I think.) It's pretty much just preference, but the only one I wouldn't get again for sure is the pulled pork. The pork was so so for bbq and it just felt like eating spoonfulls of sweet bbq sauce. Everything else I would get if for some reason I wasn't getting my top 2. The small size is quite large and generally enough food for me unless I'm superrrr hungry. Last time we went we got a half pitcher of sangria for $15 which was an unexpectedly great value because half a pitcher was a lot! Also the service is always great (nice severs, food never takes too long.)"

It's only great because there's a lot of different toppings that you could get, but even making your own poutine can get expensive. The poutine comes out with cold gravy and the cheese curds wouldn't melt because of it. The meats on top aren't warm either. The sandwiches are alright at best as well. The bill came out to be $50 for 2 poutines (1 regular and 1 large), 1 smoked meat sandwich  (just the sandwich) and an iced tea. Not very worth it.Good ideas, but poor execution overall."

The service was friendly and fast, and the small portion is already quite large. My family of four shared three small poutines.The hand crushed potatoes are really good. We created our own poutine and added the red wine sauce. Definitely try this sauce! The pulled pork poutine was also good, but the julienne fries got really soggy really quickly since they were so thin. The Montrealer had smoked meat, one fried pickle, and Swiss cheese. It was good, but the least favorite of the three.In general, this is a great place to go if you've never had poutine before."

The staff was great making me feel right at home. They explained the process and the daily specials. I tried the home fries, cheese curds, tomato, onion, mushrooms and slow cooked roast.

It's an ambitious idea but not highly recommended if you actually want to continue your day (insert food coma) or make it home at the end of your night and not wake up still sitting at the table (call an Uber).  The decor is simple, warm and inviting. There's plenty of wood for cozy winter nights and the heat works well even if you're like me and prefer to sit in the window when it's 8 degrees out because you're addicted to people-watching on the street.  There's also free wifi, a plus for us tourists with limited data plans.Food:You get the option of choosing from one of the many poutine experiences that they offer or go completely of script with the selection card that they offer to you. I kind of want to go back and just check all the boxes and see what they say one day; there's a lot of boxes!  Choose your preferred cheese(s), choose your preferred gravy (vegans welcomed), choose from so many meat options and even your style of fries/potatoes. I recommend the home style cuts that they do.  The only way that you'll be disappointed in this restaurant is if you get too outlandish with you choice of flavor mixing, but the ingredients are good so i really can't see one going off the rails.There's finally also some good beer options local and import.  I believe that there may be dessert, but I've only ever made it to the to-go boxes. Don't forget to wear your sweat pants/yoga pants/something with an elastic waistband."
/user_details?userid=ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w,Franki H.,"New Haven, CT",4 star rating,"We came here while visiting Montreal because we had to get poutine somewhere. They had a small paper menu for customizing your own poutine by just check boxes for the elements you want added with the prices for each addition right there. It makes it easy, otherwise you can order a pre-made concoction from the menu. We ended up getting one of their house special and a make-your-own. I will say that with each addition on the make-your-own, they do not skimp you. My boyfriend got goat cheese on his and it was intense! They added plenty! So while each item incurs a charge of $1-$4, they give you your money's worth! That said, I'd stick with the house special because the combination of the pulled pork, red wine gravy, and crushed potatoes it was a great poutine. I'll say that I loved the crushed potatoes over the french fries, it just balanced all the toppings a lot better and the red wine flavor pulled it all together. A great spot for the Montreal poutine!"

We had heard so much about Poutineville from my boyfriend's extensive research on Montreal, we just had to go there! It absolutely did not disappoint!!! Walked in to a cool, hip little spot, as the normal patrons seemed to be college age or mid 20s, and we were waited on by a very helpful, courteous, and patient waitress. We don't know French or poutine, so this was incredibly helpful. Great that we found the English side of the menu too. We got the sampler dish of poutine: regular potato ""chunks"" with gravy and cheese curds and then sweet potato fries with a pepper sauce and cheese curds. Absolutely delicious, and made us a believer in this Montreal delicacy that we continued to explore over the ensuing weekend. Definitely go back!"

She sold it as her second favorite poutine place. My game plan was simple: go the traditional route. Since I was planning on tackling the plate by myself, I ordered the regular size. I built my custom poutine with regular fries, gravy and curds, but added grilled onions for a slight deviation. We checked ahead of time to make sure there was a vegetarian gravy, and to my delight, we discovered that all the sauces were vegetarian, except for the meat sauce. My plate arrives and I go to town. (I'm not good dating material) I figured the gravy would sog up my fries and I didn't want to give it a chance to do so. The gravy was tasty, but I wished the fries were cooked longer to hold up better to the gravy. The most satisfying thing about the whole dish was the squeaky cheese curds. I looked up from my empty plate to discover that my two dainty dates were unable to finish their equally sized dishes. Oh well, I win."

I think there's a little bit more of a sophistication when coming here, where there's a lot more shenanigans at La Banquise.And I like how you can basically choose whatever you want on your poutine with their simple check-in-the-box menu. Plenty of alcohol too. But I would probably skip their martinis. I wasn't a fan of that."

I even thought I had tried Poutineville, but got it confused with a visit to Frites Alors last summer. I needed a spark or it was time to hang up my fork. To say I was pleasantly surprised, by a recent visit to Poutineville is an understatement. My desire for great poutine has been renewed. Their choices of specialty poutine toppings are extensive, and you can even build your own custom topped bowl of goodness. I found there were many interesting pre-designed choices on the regular menu. I came close to ordering their signature braised beef with red wine sauce (did taste it thought, so know it's a winner), but opted for the Shepherd's pie creation (think I just missed home cooking). The well portioned plate was a satisfying mix of peas, carrots, corn, and seasoned beef on smashed potatoes, with gravy, chunky curds and a large spiral of ketchup. I'll have to try the other one next time. Perhaps I'll just take it out and eat while walking on a cool night to keep me warm.Even the service stood out, on a very busy night the servers and bus people were in great spirits, and had smiles on from the beginning to end of the meal. Many locals and visitors seemed to be enjoying their poutine experiences alike. Good stuff Poutineville. Keep it up."

/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I heard about an AYCE (all you can eat) poutine place and since I do like fries/poutine, I decided to give it a try. The AYCE poutine is only on Tuesdays after 5pm so I went there after work.When I went into Poutineville, it wasn't too crowded (I arrived a few minutes after 5pm). When I was seated, the waitress gave me 2 poutine menus. The first menu was for customized poutines where you specified everything from what types of potatoes you wanted, to the type of cheese, meats, vegetables, and poutine sauce you wanted (with each item carrying a certain cost) and the second menu comprised of what I will call poutines ""with names"" meaning the items in the poutine were pre-specified on the menu which had a fixed price.I didn't see any mention of the all you can eat poutine special at this Poutineville which surprised me (nothing advertised/posted on the wall or written in their menu) so I asked the waitress about it and she confirmed that there was an all you can eat poutine special on Tuesday after 5pm. The cost for this was $15+taxes (& tip). She informed me how the AYCE poutine worked. The poutine choices for the AYCE were limited to ~5 items from their regular poutine menu (Hat Trick, Farmer's Delight, Zeus, Classic, and Philly Steak). She also let me know that I would start off with 2 choices and then after that, I could continue to order but she would only bring 1 choice at a time. I decided to have the AYCE poutine special as opposed to ordering something specific from their menu or making my own poutine from their list of items. I also ordered a draft beer ($6.50+taxes (& tip)).The ""Hat Trick"" comprised of fresh crispy fries, bacon, minced beef, sliced hot dogs, cheese curds, and poutine sauce.The ""Farmer's Delight"" comprised of crispy fries, chicken, bacon, tomatoes, cheese curds, and poutine sauceThe ""Zeus"" comprised of hand crushed potatoes, tomatoes, red onions, cheese curds, feta cheese, slices of gyro, and red wine sauceThe ""Classic"" comprised of fries, cheese curds, and poutine sauceThe ""Philly Steak"" comprised of crispy fries, philly steak, sauteed mushrooms & onions, green peppers, cheese curds, nacho cheese, and poutine sauce.I tried all the items and personally I liked the ""Hat Trick"" and the ""Philly Steak"" the most. I had a somewhat large lunch so I barely could try all the items.When I finished, I asked the waitress for my bill and I noticed that I was overcharged for the AYCE poutine. I was charged $15 for it and I also received a charge of a single poutine (Classic) which should have been included as part of the AYCE price. I mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized when she noticed that I got charged for a classic poutine."

However, the service was rather slow, it was quite hard to get the wait staff's attention.While I thoroughly enjoyed my order, my boyfriend not so much, he said his plate was too salty.

Portions here are huge though. The chicken sandwich was perfect - tender chicken, fresh veggies, nicely toasted bread. An up charge of $2 for poutine is the way to enjoy a great meal here.

You can select as many or as few ingredients as you want.  Definitely can be dangerous if you go overboard.  I can't say this was the best poutine I've had, but I'm grading it on a curve because of the sweet potato option.  The portions are pretty large.  Service was great."

It was perfection! I think a little atypical since most of the poutines seem to have gravy and stuff but I absolutely loved mine more than most people who had more conventional ones on our table.The area is nice and parking was very easy to find so I don't see why anything should stop you from eating here and then going on a stroll in Le Village after -- you'll need to burn off some calories."

""Poutineville"" has their crushed potato (was actually good) braised beef and wine sauce- it was good but not something to write home about. Place itself is nice but super busy and hot inside, washrooms have frosted glass doors (who thought it's a good idea?

Very crunchy with good fluff in the middle.  The gravy had a good taste, but came lukewarm... it didn't even soften up the curds (which they didn't give a lot of) or warm up the cold toppings.  The service was hot and cold.... It took a while for me to get seated, even though the restaurant was mostly empty and there were more than enough staff members to service the customers. The older gentleman who took my order was superb, reminded me to choose my cheese and gravy when i didn't check them off the order sheet.  However, the young man who took his time showing me to my seat also took his time to grab my bill.... in fact, he completely forgot to do it, and went chatting with his buddy instead. After waiting for more than 5 min, I asked another staff to grab my bill and it only took him a second.  Overall, definitely give this place a try if you're really into potatoes like me and want to try something new.

It was just so different from those poutines I had from other places and it was just so YUMMY. Although I don't really like French fries I throughly enjoyed the poutine here and would recommend anyone to try this place if you want to try the best poutine in town.
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"I  just had my first ever poutine here so I don't feel like I have the right to judge it yet. I can say that it was as good as you imagine fries with cheese and gravy to be. The potions are big. You definitely won't leave hungry. Nevertheless I have the feeling that there might be much more impressive poutines out there. Poutines that are not just exactly what you expect, but ones that can completely change your view on this Quebec classic. I'll sure let you know when I've ate my way through Montreal's poutineries and found the holy grail.The money you leave here depends very much on what you choose to top your poutine with. If you go with the cheapest options you can get away with $10."

Poutineville transforms a could be simple experience into something whimsical. Choose a creation from the menu or create your own. Layers of house cut fries, smothered in vegetarian gravy, soft and beautiful cheese curds and as many toppings as you'd like. Being my first foray into this magical world of poutine, I played it safe and only added on tomatoes and sautéed onions, and it was delicious! For the more seasoned poutine venturers, the recommended 'house special' style of potato bits seems to be the hit. Also quite nice, a decent selection of local drafts on tap. If ever I'm in the Montreal area again, I'll definitely have to stop by."

With my group we tried the Montrealer and the House Special as well as a create your own option using a special paper menu they give you. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection of sangria to chose from. Parking in the area can be tricky to come by so I would recommend grabbing a bus which lets you out close by.

I was surprised that there were so many options and would definitely take advantage of that next time. Instead, I ordered a regular-sized ""Hat Trick,"" which boasted 3 meats (hot dogs, bacon, and minced beef), cheese curds, regular-cut fries, and gravy. The curds were an unusual experience and gave a bit of resistance as I chewed (I assume this is the correct texture). It was delicious, but I just couldn't muster the strength to finish it.A nice selection of beer rounds out the menu, so JJ and I split a pint. This of course went perfectly with the poutine, and I would absolutely come back again next time I'm in the city."

You have the choice of creating your own poutine or choosing one of their specialities. We went with ordering the specialties, the pulled pork poutine, because I'd imagine the cost could get a little out of control when ordering your own. It was exactly what I expected and more. The combination of flavors was like a party in your mouth. The addition of brie is genius. The only downfall was service wasn't so good.

It's hearty and fun to eat! I just verified, their gravy and fries are gluten free and the fries are cooked in oil separate from the pogo sticks so it seems like there is no cross contamination. They also offer the option of dairy free cheese.I just went for the basic poutine, my husband tried the crushed potatoes. The crushed potatoes do taste better however they also tasted extra crunchy and oily so I'm sure the regular cut is healthier. I wouldn't recommend a large unless you are known to have a decent appetite as the regular is perfectly sized for 1 person.The beer was excellent (I didn't have any due to my gluten allergies but husband loved it)Service was fast and efficient and the ambiance is nice with music and the hockey game on in the background. They were playing Christmas music seeing that it's Dec 21st. Seems like a cool spot to bring kids, hang out with coworkers, or just to try out a poutine while you're in town!The greek salad had a little too much Oregano on it for my taste and the feta was crumbled feta and I prefer the cubes of feta.  I wouldn't order that salad again but maybe if you like crumbled feta and extra extra oregano it might be your thing."

I ordered the Farmer's something or another which is crispy potatoes topped with cheese curds, chicken, bacon, potatoes, and I subbed the poutine sauce for peppered sauce that the server recommended for a less gravy-like option. Everyone at my table ordered something different and everyone loved every last bite. The small size is more than enough for one person!

/user_details?userid=YYB_BOY3oHV2yOwOWMcD4A,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"""Gravy and fries . . . I guess"" Since everyone in the States always say that you HAVE to eat a Poutineville when you are in Montreal, I checked it out. Actually, this was my second time here.Sorry go against many of the reviews here but I just do not get the hype around the place. Do not get me wrong the staff and the service are GREAT and the prices are moderate but I really do not see the need to wait in a long ling for gravy and fries. The attractive feature of the place is that you can create your own poutines with various combinations of potatos, meats, cheeses, veggies (who has time for those?), and sauces. I would recommend thinking outside of the box and go with the tomato sauce. Plus, you can select a small or large size. I would go with the small unless you are in severe starvation mode. Also, if you are in super starvation mode, one can get the Heart Attack poutine, which weights 15 pounds!!!! Tres grosse (a feable attempt writing in french). Wait is poutine masculine or feminine? Actually, I forget what I put in my poutine (aside from pulled pork and bacon) but it was decent. My only complaints are that the pulled pork was not as tender as I would have liked, the bacon pieces were really small, and the gravy sauce (this time I went for the ""traditional gravy rather than the tomato sauce) was a little bland. I would recommend going there just for the experience and to say that you have been there. I went this time because I was traveling with someone and it was his first time in Montreal. Oh, to avoid waiting in a long line try going in the afternoon around 1pm. Also, they have added Negroni's to the cocktail list. The barender (or manager) really wanted to make sure that the Negronis were made correctly, since they are new for this establishment."

Once seated, we were able to choose from ""set"" poutine options or create our own concoctions. I opted to create my own poutine, which included their vegan gravy, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, guacamole, a fried egg, and cheese curds (of course). I believe I had opted for their standard fries as well. My table and I also shared their house salad.Holy crap, was my poutine delicious. Heavy, yes, but oh so delicious. The house salad was a great idea as it really helped with the heaviness of our meal. The marinated eggplants in the salad was phenomenal. Writing this review up gives me a slight pang in my heart as I am saddened by the fact that this delicious eatery is located so far away from me. Service also happened to be excellent.

/user_details?userid=jJOBopqF-DOF3eJED-ffwg,Alice T.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"3.5 stars. Great first-time experience eating gourmet poutine. It's just not something I would want to eat again and again. Long line out the door, but we probably waited 30 mins for a party of 2. We got a spot in the back of the restaurant at the bar, so some flexibility with where you'll sit will help secure a seat faster.We had the Poutineville with braised beef, wine sauce, mozzarella, and cheese curds and the Montrealer with smoked meat, mushrooms, cheese, poutine sauce, and a fried pickle. I expected to like the Poutineville better, because I'm a big fan of braised beef in wine sauce, and I did not think I would like smoked meat. However, the Poutineville wasn't salty enough for me. It turned out to be a lot less flavorful than the saltier and seasoned smoked meat on the Montrealer. Also, just get the smaller of the two size options. There is no need to get the bigger one, because you'll either get full or you will feel so crappy about yourself that you will stop eating. I think what makes Poutineville different from other places like La Banquoise are the gourmet toppings it offers. Additionally, Poutineville has a whole a la carte make-it-youself menu where you can choose exactly which toppings you want on your poutine. You even have different options for the potato- fries or smashed potatoes. It seems like the smashed potatoes is the more popular version here. It was also our first time trying Canadian beer. The St. Ambroise cream ale is really good. My bf was freaking out at first because they weren't filling the glass as you normally would with a beer to avoid getting too much head. But be patient- this is to build up a beautiful head of cream mousse."

What happened the night of Jan 30th was one of the most disgraceful experience in Montreal and ever happened to my family as a tourist in a restaurant. First I have to say that night was -13 Celsius degrees, kinda of weather that you don't leave a dog outside. We, 3 adults and 4 kids between 5 and 12, arrived in front of the restaurant around 7:30. The place was packed, the entry hallway packed. My wife opens the outside door to enter the restaurant to try to find out how long is the wait as we literally couldn't sit outside with the 4 kids. She starts asking one of the persons in line how long is the wait time when the unfortunate happened. One of the very friendly gentlemen's ahead, who was waiting on the hallway yelled back at us To Shut The F...g door. At this literally we were stunned, no comment, we had 4 kids with us! From this point my wife warned this guy that there are kids around so he needs to watch his language. This didn't stopped the guy and in his help another person who was with them start asking my wife to step outside so he can close the door. Nothing stopped him from literally pushing my wife and my 5 year old out. I cannot describe the attitude of those persons, like we almost robbed them, very sad sentiment overall. As I said, this review is not for the food, but I wished the place to be better managed, someone from the restaurant staff should've acknowledged this and not permitted. Also they should have a checkin area, if you are a popular place you should have a little bit of space inside and a waiting list or something.We ended up going next door as we literally didn't want to experience anything around those persons."

However, the addition of grilled chicken, succulent bacon and fresh tomato put it over the top.  Having only heard the stories of squeaky curds I was happy to learn that they were not myths but truths.  The other we ordered was a little bit of a different take.  A sweet potato fry, with pepper gravy and cheese curds.  The sweet potato fries are obvious and delicious.  The pepper greave was simply amazing.  A nice dark gravy with a silky smooth texture and nice peppery back drop on the sauce.  The cheese curds were the same as our other and were just as good.Overall, Poutineville is everything that you might assume by the name.  With dozens of possibilities there is sure to be something for everyone. If any of their pre-picked poutine orders don't suit you, they have the option to custom make your own.  Without a doubt, you cannot come to Montreal and not get poutine.

After spending the morning shriving aka sight seeing in the Canadian freezing weather, we decided to stop by poutineville to pile on some body fat to battle the cold. We arrived right before the lunch rush but this place already seemed a bit understaffed- One man and one woman. The woman seated us right by the door where the wind was blowing in non stop by dropping the utensil sets onto the table. Before we had a chance to move, she was already gone. The place was still pretty empty then so it was very easy for us to just move around, not quite sure why she gave us such crappy table in the first place. Two of us went with the create your own poutine after doing the math and realized it would cost more to go with their combo specials. We made the mistake of going when we were all really hungry.  Even after asking for the waiter to show us an example of large size, we still made the mistake of ordering one for each of us. When our orders came out, we knew we are probably eating the same poutine for dinner and breakfast tomorrow. It would had been smarter if all 3 of us just shared 1 large. So onto he poutine! I went with the sampler where I swap the crushed potato for more sweet potato fries ($2 extra) and asked for guacamole on the side ($1.75). The size of my order was relatively small compared to equally priced large. However I was happy to be able to sample two different types of gravies. I especially enjoyed the one with the red wine gravy. The pepper gravy had an Asian kick to it - still very tasty just not as big of a fan. My fiancé's brother went with nacho cheese, cheese curds, hot dogs and meat sauce. It tasted pretty much like chili cheese fries with random pieces of hot dog and cheese curds. My fiancé went all out with his - pepperoni, ground beef, corn dog, gravy, cheddar cheese, cheese curd. I wasn't a big fan of his gravy and he def went way overboard with the toppings. After an hr, he still barely made a dent in his order. The service was okay with the lack of staffing. The waitress spoke broken English and seemed a little pushy and overwhelmed initially. But then I realized that's just how she is.. ""Friendly"" - aka the French tough love way . Overall it satisfied my poutine craving for the year."

Nope. Just no. Montrealer - only reason why this place got 2 stars. It was filled over the top with cheesy goodness, meat galore, and great tasting gravy!Farmer's delight- the last time I'm gonna try to be 'healthier'. The tomato made it taste fishy and weird . The gravy was not the same as the Montrealer...kind of smelt like the farm (I guess the name is as suggested  woops!)

One was still frozen.. told the waiter and he took it away....threw out the evidence and POOF! Silence.

Can choose type of fries right down to type of toppings eg meat, veggies and even cheese! Large portion is huge and probably shareable. My friend and I got the large as was reasonably price but couldn't finish it!!  We each got one to trial different meats and toppings. I got chicken - she got meat and there was endless amounts of both. I suggest beef over chicken and also the brisket or smoked meat! Loud and busy.

Tons of different options to suit every taste and every diet (except for low carb, of course). Vegetarians, rejoice! We can eat most stuff here beyond the meat section, including the original, red wine, and pepper gravies. The only vegan option is original gravy (better than most vegan gravies, but dull by comparison) and Daiya.I'd highly recommend sticking with their crushed potatoes when designing your dream poutine. The texture is incredible, and stands up well to a liberal application of gravy. Their sweet potato fries seemed too soft and got soggy quickly, but were still delicious with the au poivre gravy. Minus one star because sometimes the fries can be a bit soggy, and the original gravy is kind of bland. Next time, I would get the crushed potatoes, curds, and a mix of the red wine and pepper sauces."

The fries were not as large as wedges or airy as McDonald's fires and had right amount of potato filling. The gravy was very tasty and the cheese was evenly melted in the poutine.

I settled on the house poutine which came with cheese curds (duh), braised beef in wine sauce, and gravy. Man, talk about rich! My sister and I also shared a goat cheese salad to try and cut the richness of the poutine. Canadians eat this as a main entrée? I guess it's really no different than chili cheese fries but then again, I never eat that as a main either but I know some folks do.The highlight for me here was actually one of their desserts - the Gateau fromage Bailey's Irish Cream (aka Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake). This was one of THE best desserts I've ever had in my life. The crust was light and crumbly, the center, rich but not too rich and the milk chocolate shavings balanced it all beautifully.

I was craving something spicy so the fire breather hit the spot. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy foods so I didn't think it was really that spicy. It was more of a moderate, enjoyable level of spicy rather than a melt-your-face-off spicy. The waiter thought I was crazy and praised my ability to finish it off without a sip of water, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad.The house poutine was delicious - the meat melts in your mouth and has a great flavor to it. The potatoes in both were perfectly fried and bite-sized. If you're a fan of spicy things then I would definitely get the fire breather. It comes with 3 wings on top and I don't know what kind of sauce they use, but it was AMAZING. It tasted like a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I would definitely come back for that one.

Luckily we got there around 6pm because by 7pm there was a line forming out of the door. My husband ordered 911 wings and while tasty they did not have a ton of heat but the flavor was very good.

I ended up here after trying La Banquise first, but leaving after we realized they don't take credit cards, and we had no cash. (We also encountered this problem at Patati Patata, so bonus point to Poutineville for accepting credit cards.)I had never had poutine before, so I wanted to try the original. We ordered the classic iteration, with regular cut french fries, cheese curds and poutine gravy. (The way their menu is designed, however, allows you to customize it in a multitude of ways including different cheeses, vegetables, meats, and gravies.) They have two sizes, regular and large, and I found the regular to be sufficiently large enough for two people who each want a moderate serving. The poutine was amazing. Everything was piping hot, and the ratio of fries to cheese to gravy was perfect. The fries tasted like the ones my grandmother used to make-cut fresh and fried instantly. (My only complaint is that they could have been crispier, but that's a personal preference.) The consistency of the gravy was similar to that of a glaze, and the flavor was rich, savory and reminiscent of french onion soup. Poutineville was a great choice all around, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try poutine for the first time."

The Menus were simple. We ordered the Montrealais its a Smoked Meat Poutine it came out with 2 side salads for us, I thought not only were they delicious salads but she brought us out 2 because we were sharing the Poutine, Nice Plus!  The Poutine was Mashed Fries, I had to try them cause who hasn't had regular cut or shoestring before??! They were surprisingly different. It was a little bit more like a Baked Potato Poutine. The Gravy and mushrooms were delicious I'm pretty sure it was made from scratch. The Cheese was Swiss and I'm not a fan of Swiss but this cheese on this Poutine made it work perfectly it was heaven.   It was topped with a fried Pickle wedge. It was nicely seasoned and the pickle inside is a bit warm its a neat sensation if you never had a fried pickle before try it!   I do agree that there is not a lot of Smoked Meat in it, it could use more, and they could be more generous with the kinds of Fries offered aka Stingy.

You can order one of their pre-set poutines, or you can do a custom on a handy sheet they give you, ticking off what type of fries, gravy, and toppings you want. Portions were suuuper generous: two people will definitely get full off of one order. We ordered three for five of us, and later that night three of my friends shared a large order we took to-go. Beers can be pretty cheap; they had specials if there were hockey games on, but even so pitchers were a decent price. There was a long line when we went around prime dinner time (7 pm), but the hostess found a place to squeeze us in fairly quickly. If you are willing to wait, eat there, because the order we took to go wasn't as good after the gravy and cheese curds got cold."

With its numerous options and make-your-own-poutine formula, you can't go wrong! Although my husband and I have had to wait to be seated on a couple of occasions, busy nights evidently, the staff always is courteous, albeit their service could be more efficient and focused. I've read some reviewers complain about the drinks menu, implying no one should ever order wine or martinis with such a greasy and earthy meal; I will say that a glass of red or white wine with a poutine is a surprisingly attractive and delectable match. Of all the choices on the menu, I have found after a few visits that the red wine sauce accompanied with marinated eggplant make a great match for the adventurous poutine lover. Try it and see for yourself! I highly recommend Poutineville as one of Montreal' best comfort foods and city icons."
/user_details?userid=K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,Claudia D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ahh poutineville! My favourite spot in Montreal to get a poutine. Most people would argue that La Banquise is better, but I would have to disagree. I find La Banquise burns their fries and they don't have much flavour, as opposed to Poutineville which actually gives you a selection on the type of fries you want with your poutine and doesn't over cook them. I always go with the ""mashed"" fries. It's like they're fried, mashed and then refried. It sounds weird but they are the best fries I have ever had with a poutine. They also have a variety of sauces to choose from along with a good selection of cheeses, vegetables and meat toppings. Want more than 1 type of cheese on your poutine? No problem! You could always tell if a poutine cheese is good due to the fact that it squeaks when chewing it. Luckily, these guys serve up super squeaky cheese so you know it's the real deal. What I love about this place is that they're not stingy with their toppings, they will pack it on! I usually have to unbuckle my pants halfway through."

I will be fine if all of them are busy and everyone was treated like me. But the fact is she walk directly to the other table and ask is everything ok and what else do they need.When I finished another waiter comes and told us we have to pay 17% tips not 15% or 10%.

It blows your tastebuds away.. and the thing is their portions are larger than you would expect. I had to take half of it to go.My boyfriend made his own, a regular with mushrooms, onions, philly steak and LOTS of cheese. It was basically a philly cheese steak, but in poutine form. The great thing about this place is that the toppings just aren't on the top of the fries like many poutine places. No, they got toppings everywhere hidden in the fries. The service is also really good, and the server was attentive (but then again we were the only people in the entire restaurant...).Overall if I was visiting Montreal again, I would definitely come here again.

I like to keep my poutines ""classic"", so I just ordered the regular cheese curds and poutine gravy, but I did order the smashed fries. The smashed fries are better than they sound. It is almost as if someone made fries...smashed them...and then fried them again. They are perfectly crunchy on the outside and make the meal everything you could ask for. For dessert, I had the choco choux, which was a chocolate cake with raspberries and ENTIRE cream puffs inside. I've never seen anything like it. I love the fact that you can either pick something from the menu or you can build your own poutine. There is a selection of about five different gravies, few different kinds of cheese, tons of meats and vegetables. You can choose if you want a small or large portion which is convenient. Be careful though, with enough toppings you may end up paying way more than you planned. For those who are feeling a bit crazy (or have a large party), they offer a giant poutine which consists of 15 pounds of fries and more toppings than one could possibly eat. I had the privledge to see one in person just as I was leaving and the restaurant started to clap at its arrival.  The staff was polite and attentive. Will definitely be going back. Definitely one of the best poutine places in Montreal.(Note that they don't accept AMEX!)"

I hadn't been to Montreal in 20 years, so my soul was craving poutine in ways you can't imagine. Mile End in Brooklyn is an approximation but nowhere near the real thing. We were promptly seated outside and checked off order cards they leave on the table - super convenient. I had crushed (then fried) potatoes (the house specialty), regular curds, sauce and smoked meat on top. The fries arrive on the medium-well side so there's a thick coating of crispy exterior to stand up to the sauce. And the amount used is perfect because nothing ever gets soggy. They've got their ratios down to a science. The curds got heavenly melty, the flavors of the smoked meat really were second fiddle to the gravy - but that's a compliment on the gravy. I see there are really countless combinations one could order but I'm a straight poutine man myself. I think in the future i would not add the meat, but I loved having the option to. This place is great, I can't wait to come back."

Did a build your own poutine. I got pulled pork in mine and my husband did a handful of meats. I liked that you can do many cheeses for the same price and there's a lot of gravy options as well as selected cut fries options. For toppings there are so many choices of veggies and meats and sides. We both did classic fries and gravy but they are known for their crushed fries. Overall it was good it can get a bit pricy with the build your own. I also didn't like that mine was swimming in gravy (like beating swimming) and the fries were limited. Because of that my first choice is still labanquise.

You get a surprising amount of cheese and fries for $7 and I can only imagine what you get with the large ($9). My dining buddy opted for The Montrealer ($12/$15) with smoked meat, mushrooms, grated cheese gravy and fries and topped off with a battered deep fried pickle.

Starting with the fries, their crushed potatoes are amazing, the sweet potato fries are perfect as well. The cheese curds are truly squeaky and attention is made that they don't melt in the gravy. In few words you can experience quality classical poutine in Poutineville. Besides that you can make your own poutine, which the patrons seem to be excited about. In addition to the standard menu you will be given sheet with all the ingredients you can pick and concoct your meal. I'm generally happy to have that option, but this is also a risky approach towards your food,  you may end up mixing ingredients you love separately that just don't fit together. This was the experience of my first visit and since then I have learned my lesson not to experiment too much.  I would definitely recommend to Montreal visitors from abroad to go with a standard combination from the menu if this is their first time trying the dish. Otherwise service is quick and efficient. The guys will feed you, make you pay your bill timely and rush the next customers in as sometimes Poutineville gets busy. Have fun!"

It was a pretty simple dish with braised beef, mozzarella cheese and potatoes and red wine sauce. I was floored by how good the flavors and textures were - especially the potatoes which had an amazing crispiness on the outside and softness inside. You could just serve me those potatoes in that beefy flavor and I'd be a happy customer.Poutineville has a quirky set up and were playing 70s disco the whole time we were there. The waitstaff were much older than what I usually see at restaurants, but they looked like they partied it up in the 70s. It seemed like a place that was stuck in that era, which was kind of funny and charming in its own way.They had many different kinds of poutine including a make-your-own option but since it was my first time, I wanted to try the original.

Additionally, and to be fair to the rest of the poutine palaces, In my eyes, there are 3 categories of poutine:Low: generic curds, brown gravy on friesMid tier: quality ingredients but not deviating too far from the original dish premise. Posh: gourmet potatoes with exotic meats as toppings (i.e. duck confitt, tuna)This place is a firm mix between the mid-level and posh. Thy off menu where you can create your own custom masterpiece. On the first visit I tried the original as well as the General Tso's poutine. The second i just stuck to the original version; why be adventurous when the original is that GOOD!Man nothing beats the original! Soft fluffy cheese curds and uber crunchy fries that somehow stayed nice and crispy while being covered in gravy, The gamechanger was the red wine gravy; it  was simply amazing! It was to tasty and did not overpower, over grease or over anything to the dish. It was perfect! I wish I could take home a gallon of it an brush my teeth every morning with it.

Also, make sure you stick with the cheese curds and do not change it to any other kinds of cheeses (poutine isn't poutine without the curds).I usually build mine with smashed potatoes, regular gravy and cheese and top up with two vegetables and one protein (I find hot-dog sausages particularly good in poutine - they are normal processed hotdog sausages).

Afterall, how many different variations can you do with fries, cheese curds, and gravy?After a quick search, Poutineville was one of the few, high-rated places that was open on a Monday. The menu offers a number of different poutine combinations and even allows you to construct your own, much like The Counter for burgers. We settled on the house special, Poutineville, which was cheese curds, mozzarella, braised beef, and wine sauce all over crushed potatoes. I can't say it was one element that separated and elevated this poutine from any other I've had, because it was everything. The crushed potatoes were great because it gave it a crispy texture that goes missing when most fries become soggy under the gravy. The braised beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the wine sauce really tied the gravy and cheese together. We split a large between three people, which was enough, but I still wanted more.

She gave my husband and I lots of tips about what to do in Montreal. She also brought us our potions with the crushed potatoes instead of the regular(the speciality O'Neal that we ordered had the regular fries). The ambience was very nice. We tried the Brazilian coffee and the Irish coffee. Both were really good. The Brazilian coffee was a lot stronger (definitely a generous amount of alcohol). We got the Firebreather. That came with a spicy sauce, peppers and three 911 chicken wings. The wings were absolutely fantastic. The gravy was really tasty. I loved that they had crushed fries. Absolutely great."

There are so many variations that you can create. The server is always friendly (it has always been the same when i go there) and the you don't have to wait a long time for you order to get to the table! I also like the hamburger steak a lot. It's smothered in gravy and the coleslaw that comes with is really good! I used to like La Banquise a lot but this place has come to be my favourite poutine joint!

It's very crowded, and very loud- both due to the music and the amount of customers. Come here for the food, not to sit down and catch up with someone."

That this place uses crushed potatoes versus cut is interesting... I didn't like them as much. The gravy was a bit on the watery side. The curds, however were very fresh and squeaky.

I decided to wave to a waitress and told her no one came to take our order yet. She sent another waitress and after order was placed we got our food within 5 minutes. We were both intrigued by the Poutine-pizza, since there is no pictures in the menu, we had imagined that it was a pizza with a Poutine on top of it. And the staff seemed so overwhelmed that we didn't even bother asking when placing the order, since we were just too excited to finally be able to order some food. Poutine showed up, but no pizza. It seems like the ""Poutine-pizza"" is juste served in a flat plate instead of a regular bowl. They had their specialty ""patates écrasées"" (squished potatoes) in both of our dish. Mine was the BBQ version and I liked it. My friend had the ""all-dressed"" and je found it had no particular taste or excitement to it at all.In a nutshell: Overall, the premises were clean, food served hot, staff overwhelmed and not on the ball but polite, I might be back to try their regular poutines before I make up my mind about his place!"

The interior was very nice and clean, and I ordered the Fermier poutine, which was your regular poutine that came with chicken, tomato, and bacon as add-ons. Upon receiving my order, it didn't really look the most appealing, but I decided to give it a chance. It didn't really wow me by any means, and the chicken tasted kind of funky and not exactly the freshest; plus the bacon was either nonexistent or tasted weird. Anyway, I managed to finish the whole thing, but I experienced pretty bad stomach pains within half an hour to an hour after consuming it, so it definitely felt like almost instantaneous food poisoning. As someone who doesn't have any allergies and has a high pain tolerance, I did end up feeling rather frustrated/displeased by everything overall considering that the food exited my body in rather unpleasant ways. I'm reluctant to return again as a result."

Its more of baked potato with skin taste with amazing gravy that is tasty as not too tangy. Their sauteed onions and mushrooms are great and sweet. The curds are simply ah-mazing! Squeaky morsels that stay put and not melt into one big chunk. Service is good and fast. Price is a bit high though.

You have an option to make your own or pick from the 15 plus different options from the menu.  From the menu, we loved the firebreather poutine. It was the right amount of heat to compliment the salty  frites. A big plus is a variety of options for vegetarians and your choice of cut for the frites. VEGGIE POUTINE! Another plus is the owner, whom was very friendly and shared stories with us about the 15 pound poutine eating contest."

The gravy was well seasoned though a bit heavy on the corn starch or whatever thickening agent they use. We ordered two diff dishes but they tasted very similar. Might have just been the same gravy. I liked that we can choose our toppings. The portions are huge, even for regular. I still ate majority of it, and hated myself afterward. I don't know why people love poutine so much though. Fries topped with gravy, meats and cheeses would always be good but that's all it is. I can't compare this with any other poutine I've had as I've never had another.

I highly recommend the crushed potatoes and the red wine gravy (the extra $1 is super worth it). I wouldn't recommend getting the guac or eggplant though. Portions are HUGE and decently priced.

/user_details?userid=7cL0wq8QwMGlUQnG2ruLSA,Casey U.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Team, I think I'm falling in love. No, not with a woman (if you want a fair assessment of my dating life and romantic capabilities, I'd recommend listening to ""Autoclave"" by the Mountain Goats on repeat and at full volume [youtube.com/watch?v=RZ-2…), but rather with a city. Her name? Montreal.Why would I mention that I'm falling in love with Montreal in a review about a Poutinery? In a survey among Canadians, Poutine was listed as the 10th best Canadian invention (nytimes.com/2007/05/23/d…;), and, when paired with a ""Le Cheval Blanc"" wheatbeer seems to function as Montreal's official meal. If you compare that with San Francisco's official meal of organically sourced self-righteous loathing and PBR (or 4 dollar toast, ugh...), you can see why I'm a little in love.Poutineville gave me my first real taste of true poutine (most of the examples I've eaten in the States are tragic) in their innovative ""Montrealer"", which combined smoked meat, swiss, mushrooms, poutine sauce, and topped with a fried pickle on top. It was incredible. The smoked, pastrami-like meat paired perfectly with the salty, rich sauce, and the broiled-to-crunchy swiss cheese on top rounded everything out perfectly. Paired with the slightly spicy flavors of a Le Cheval Blanc, it was damn near perfect, considering that temperatures outside were hovering around -2 Centigrade. As I paid my bill and walked out, the Quebec curling team struck a blow against the undefeated Albertans, the music swelling to vapid chorus proclaiming ""I'm a winner!"", I couldn't help but cheer with the rest of the bar.Overall: Five Stars. Damn impressive stuff.Extras:Accessible by Station Beri-UQAM (Yellow, Orange and Green Lines), and near to the Gare d'autocars.Service is extraordinarily friendly.Design-your-own poutine is an available ordering option.I'm sorely tempted to try the ""Heart Attack"" the next time I'm in Montreal, which consists of five pounds of poutine topped with every-goddamned-delicious-thing-on-the-planet."

Poutineville basically serves you dinner on top of regular poutine.The first night my boyfriend had the house special - braised beef, red wine sauce and cheese curds. I had the filet mignon, blue cheese, cheese curds, mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. We were so stuffed, I couldn't even finish the fried pickles we ordered as an appetizer (which are also amazing).We came back here the next night with five more people and Poutineville has an amazing staff that was more than accommodating!

We came here on Thanksgiving Monday, specifically to build our own poutines. I quite enjoyed the concept, and was surprised by the plethora of options given for type of fries, sauces, meats, veggies and cheeses. I built a poutine version of a Philly cheese steak; regular & sweet potato fries, cheese curds, gravy, flank steak and green peppers. Three words: AH. MAY. ZZZING. It was delish; I am a huge poutine fan (duh, who in Quebec isn't!!) and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to venture outside the ""fries, cheese curds and gravy"" boundaries of the original poutine!"
/user_details?userid=i0CEzQEzU8VbfEUvY4vTdA,Kristi L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oh. my. god. I am craving this right now as I write this review. As my extent of knowledge about Canada goes (which is very little), nothing is more Canadian than poutine, right?? I definitely had to try this place out before I left Canada. Even though Poutineville was only half a mile away from our hotel, I was seriously considering if it was worth it having to walk 10 minutes in a snow storm to eat here. I may have gotten a little bit sick, but all I have to say is that I have no regrets. I was never ever a fan of carbs, of cheese, or anything that this place would stand for, but somehow, Poutineville converted me. I opted for the make-your-own-poutine menu, since I was all about having it my own way. It starts at 8-9 dollars, and you work your way up depending on how much stuff you decide to put in your poutine. From what I can recall, I added mushrooms, hot dog, bell peppers, gravy, runny egg, and some other options that I don't even remember. I ended up with about 10 additional items on top, which totaled up to about $19 just for that one dish. That sounds like a lot, but when the dish was served to us, it all made sense; it was huge!  It was like 2 days worth of food for me and my boyfriend, no way I would be able to finish that in one sitting. After eating through 1/4 of it, we decided to pack it up and enjoy it later.I wish I was able to explain how good my customized poutine was. Yeah the flavors didn't really match, but I devoured it nevertheless. I especially enjoyed the cheese curds, and I'm not even a fan of cheese. The service was quick and the drink selection was adequate. If I ever find myself in Montreal again, you can almost guarantee that this will be the first place I will stop by at."

I chose the latter and took the standard poutine (french fries, gravy, cheese curds) and mixed it up a bit by ordering their house specialty crushed potatoes in place of fries, and adding onions and montreal smoked meat. The result was AMAZING. While the service was a little lacking and the inside of the restaurant a little too hot it was definitely worth it to get my hands on this excellent poutine.

The patty itself was pretty thick. The poutine itself was also good. Tons and tons of cheese. The cheese curds did melt a lot though. I though real cheese curds didn't melt so easily or at all? I could be wrong. The eggplant was marinated and ""roasted"" but it tasted really sour and soggy. Overall, the poutine was a bit more sour than my liking and tastes like sour pizza toppings. Overall experience was ""meh"". Very minimal service. No smiles."

No matter what I've ordered, it's been good - they use good ingredients for everything. Admittedly, some of my choices have been better than others, but that's more my fault than the restaurant's.

""Poutine for Carly!  And poutine for David!"" she said as she sat our plates in front of us.We then proceeded to eat like we were in prison, hardly slowing down to take a breath.    ""How is this not, like, a thing at home?"" Dave asks me as he begins polishing off the leftovers on my plate.  ""If there were a food truck with this, people would LOSE THEIR MINDS.""  Poutineville doesn't skimp on the salty, thin, brown gravy and the smashed and fried house potatoes managed to maintain their crispiness to the end.  So good.Unfortunately, probably not so good for you and we felt the gut bomb later on.  We had lofty hopes to eat poutine twice on our trip but only made it once (probably a good thing).Still, when in Montreal, a must eat."

The moment I entered I was hit with an awful smell - something I had smelled before but couldn't put my finger on. I almost had to leave when I realized that it was the same smell I had encountered in a tranny bar once (don't ask!). I would describe it as two-thirds pee and one-third cigarettes. Gross.My fiancé had eaten there before and assured me it was good. He didn't seem to smell it, and the place looked pretty clean and I was starving so we ordered. I was very, very surprised when I had my goat cheese and veggie poutine. It was really good! The crushed potatoes are awesome! Besides the smell, the only other downside is the clientele that this place attracts. We were seated next to a table of about 15 kids (who couldn't have been older than 14 or 15) who were super loud and obnoxious. One girl in particular had a high-pitched nasal-y voice that made me want to punch her in the face. But that isn't the restaurant's fault I guess. The other downside- I didn't find the portions particularly filling. I wasn't very satisfied when I left, but maybe I only felt that way because it was so good and I wanted more!Long story short, I have a feeling I'll keep coming back here- but for take-out instead."

I tried the vegan cheese and it was much better than I expected! It melted uniformly and tasted very much like real cheese. If you're one to love customizing your meals, this will be perfect for you because you can create your own poutine, choosing the type of fries, sauces, cheese, and additional toppings.

That's how you determine a good fried pickle and onion ring (onion and pickle stays in place when bitten). The burgers are nothing special. I like the idea you can create your own poutine but it gets a little pricy for the poutine if you put too much stuff on it. I enjoy the crushed potatoes because its different from what other poutine places have to offer. Their choices in poutine sauces taste similar. The sauce is the most important part of the poutine and I feel like the sauces are lacking. The volcano one tastes like the original with pepper flakes. But overall, it's okay.

I really like the 'poutine' meal and i can get really serious into it... haha..The first time I went, the service was terrible. The place was filled with two groups and they were so loud we couldn't even heard our conversation. But hey, it's not really the fault of the owner, you don't really decide what group will come. So that was okay. We ordered two separate poutine each (2 small) with the home fries and the home gravy. The concept is good, you choose what you want in your poutine, it's like choosing your topping on a pizza. From there, everything looks great, the place is not high-end, it's a bit cheap, but don't expect too much, they serve poutine. When the poutine arrived, we were shocked. It was a soup, more than a poutine. I don't know if it's the home fries that don't absorb as much liquid as the traditional fries, but everything was wet, and boring. There is a certain kick to the sauce that I didn't get use to. The vegetable (pepers in my case) were not cook at all, so it was crunchy. Weird solid-crunchy-wet texture. My friend didn't like it either.On our second visit, everything was more balanced. The ambiance was much more c.lm. We ordered big poutine instead of two small ones. Everything was way better, but again, the sauce turned me off, and the size of the fries too. It's like big potato pieces, uncook, and sometimes way too big, sometimes way too small. We also went to the one on Ontario. The staff and ambiance was better. But the poutine was the same. For a poutine shop, i was not quite satisfied, but you know what? If I want a poutine, i'll stop by, because afterall, it's good. Up side : The concept is really cool. You decide the ingredients and fashion of your poutine. Price is good, a bit expensive tho. Food is good, but not great. Downside : i was anticipating better food. the ambiance is so-so. I will go again if I feel like eating a poutine."

The cheese was melted onto the poutine instead of in cheese curd form. Overall this was the better poutine because of the quality of ingredients, flavors, and the gravy, smoked meat, and cheese were layered into the poutine so that all the potatoes had flavor, not just the top. We had a hot tea and a red ale to wash down the good stuff. The portion was good for sharing."

And so I came here with a friend, with maybe only 30 minutes before closing time, but we were greeted, seated and served. Didn't know it was closing soon, but figured it out once most of the other patrons left. All of the staff were friendly to us, coming by to see if everything was good, several times during the meal. I never felt rushed even though it was near closing time, and I really appreciated that. Both of our poutine choices tasted awesome, and I can see why this place is highly rated. Great staff, decor, and food. Thanks poutineville!"

The perfect ratio of cheese to gravy to potatoes. The cheese was soft in some areas and warm and a little rubbery in others,  just the way I like it. The gravy was generous but didn't make the potato soggy. The service was efficient and friendly. Would return and try something more adventurous and get the fries instead of potatoes for comparison."

They have squish squish (squeaky cheese) & classic poutine sauce.  The fries are average, and I find they sometimes overdo it on the gravy, but I mean, that is coming from a nitpicky person.  It really is decent and they have deep fried pickles on the menu that, to my personal experience, are the best in the city, so that's a HUGE benefit.

A cool breeze blew in through the great open wall in the front of the place.     The thing was in french, and I did my best to figure out what stuff was.  After a few minutes I had a sheet with some stuff checked off, not rightfully knowing what half of it was. The owner took it, and I also asked for a plate of fried pickles. I chatted with my friends, and occasionally got left behind when they would all switch over to French. Luckily, one of them would take a moment to pause the conversation and ""subtitle"" the conversation for me. They were all nice people.     My beer came over and it was huge and delicious.  The pickles came out and they were also delicious. They were in spear format, which was kinda new. I've only had the chips before.  But these were a bit spicey, and salty-briney also. Very tasty indeed.     The poutine came out, each person had an individual bowl placed in front of them. Each personalized by what they had checked off on their lists. Or in my case, what I had randomly checked off my list.  It had to be eaten with a fork.  Cheese, meats, veggies and french fires smothered in sauce blended magically. Delicious.     We chatted, ate, drank, and made merry for some time.  But all good things must come to an end, and we called it after an hour or two.        Great place, friendly owner, good drinks, good Poutine. it's a keeper in my books."

I opted for a regular sized poutine of the vegetarian variety, with tomatoes, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, sour cream and of course gravy. It was a little soupier than I had anticipated, but I can only blame myself for choosing so many sauces/cheeses. I just couldn't pass any of those up nor do I regret my decision. My boyfriend got a large poutine, which was basically enough to feed a family of four. And he topped his with gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms and chicken. We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking.

/user_details?userid=4ZSXBbCzYFS_lvC1hvJDXQ,Diana D.,"San Antonio, TX",4 star rating,"Delish!!  We wanted to try some Montreal comfort food, and this fit the bill perfectly.  Our waitress (maybe the owner as well, as she seemed to be in charge) was super friendly and gave us great ordering advice.  Our only complaint (and why we gave 4 stars instead of 5) is that we had to wait for nearly 45 minutes to be seated.  There is really no proper waiting area, so you have to just stand in the cold doorway.  We had called about 4 hours before we arrived to make reservations, but were told we couldn't make reservations for just 3 people, however we should be seated quickly anyway.  That clearly did not happen, but nevermind -- the wait was worth it because the poutine was really hot, fresh and delicious."
/user_details?userid=gQ8mvIM4PCFepn1wn5YC1A,L M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Just heavenly! By far the best Poutine I've had in Montreal. What made our experience here exceptional was the fantastic customer service. We felt right at home even though the place was packed and we were in a rush. Their menu has something fir everyone. I highly recommend the place. Perfect stop on a cold day.

We were not disappointed! The food was great, portion sizes very large, and good beer. The waitress was very nice and did her best to help us out with translating the French. She also gave us FANTASTIC recommendations on where to go for desert. If you're in the area, it's a fun spot to visit."

The potatoes were crispy and already bite sized, making them easy to eat. The gravy / sauce was perfectly balanced. The proteins and other toppings scattered all over were like treats to find. I think the house poutine was my favorite."
/user_details?userid=T4iHlGobAACuMWZxTUy8kA,Mark L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The poutine was ok not the best though, I found the sauce to be boring and the service was rude, it seemed that the servers had more important things to do like talk about their personal lives rather than take care of the costumers."
/user_details?userid=1bZCHb3JVssLKWigyNPiZg,Dante M.,"Troy, NY",5 star rating,My new spot for Poutine in Montreal. I used to try places in old Montreal and didn't realize how much better this place is than the others. I tried the house special. Excellent portions and very well made. Great service too!
/user_details?userid=5kg5JcERUZO0jbsKu4pPAQ,A O.,"Guelph, Canada",5 star rating,"We weren't sure if we wanted to eat Poutine at Poutineville or seek other places (for instance, Patati Patata). Anyway we decided Poutineville and were not disappointed. The moment we arrived we were greeted by three people, one was the owner. The waiter was informative, pleasant, and welcoming. He suggested few variations of potines and we were not disappointed. I have to warn you though that Poutine is a heavy meal If you have high metabolism you will love experimenting with the variations,  else choose wisely.We ordered 2 Potine Sampler (I love this because of variation of texture and easy to finish), Montrealer (many textures of cheese and flavors), Steak Filet Mignon (only to the brave heart: very filling yet tasty), Rocky (was not sure if we could handle), and Hat trick (hearty meal when eaten in small quantities). We were a party of 5 and we all felt more than satisfied, yet plagued with guilt afterward. So, be careful with your choices and the size of plates. What they call small is very large portion.The seating was pretty good and the ambiance inviting. Like most small joints in Montreal, this is a family-owned restaurant, and you immediately feel   welcomed and connected to the people who work there."

I came here on a Friday and it seemed very busy, and most of the tables were full. Despite that, I was served fairly quick and the waitress was super nice. Just thinking about this place makes my taste buds water. I will definitely be coming back for more. :)"

I must say that so far, I've never met a poutine I didn't like. However, Poutineville elevated my perception of just how good poutine can be. This wasn't just good food-- it was an experience for the eyes, nose and palate. On top of this, the culinary artwork they serve up to you is served fast and with a smile. It's a good thing that we found this place late in the trip, or else I might not have eaten anywhere else."

The best thing about it is that, unlike other restaurants where you feel heavy after eating poutine, this restaurant's poutine makes you feel good instead ;)  Definitely will be going again."

/user_details?userid=ZvyXc9xCE9AO-lCXpYDrbw,T G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The Poutineville poutine is by far the best poutine I've ever tried. The only downside of Poutineville is that they put very little cheese on their poutines.
