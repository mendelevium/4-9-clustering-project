Just steps away from Notre Dame Cathedral and Place d'Armes metro, it's perfectly located. The decor is simple, bright, and inviting. Service is fast, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu; two women covered the whole restaurant.We ordered from the prix-fixe menu, and we both started with an amuse-bouche of duck rillettes. I liked that the meat still had some grain and texture to it. It was served with a basket of piping-hot baguette, nice and crusty - perfect.For appetizers, my friend enjoyed the green salad with mixed greens, heirloom carrots, and shaved beets in a delicious, mildly sweet vinaigrette. I ordered a torchon of foie gras, two generous large toast points with buttery foie gras and a tiny spoon of fig jam, served with a small side of that same tasty salad.For entrees, I had the magret of duck with foie gras sauce. The duck was nicely cooked - all the fat rendered out, slightly smoky, medium-rare except for the very end pieces that were slightly over. But it's all about the sauce: velvety, mild, decadent. I dunked all the duck and used the excellent pomme frites (fried in duck fat, yum) to mop up the rest. The dish came with sauteed mixed vegetables.My friend doesn't love duck that much; so he opted for the roast chicken breast. (Unfortunately the beef option that appeared on the online menu was unavailable that night.) The chicken was juicy and so tasty that he didn't even bother with the accompanying sauce (I didn't taste it, but I assume it was a hunter sauce.). It was served with the same delicious fries and vegetables. At the table next to us, the waitress explained that the duck ravioli was also no longer available that evening, but said that the chef could make a similar linguine dish with the same confit duck - I think that was a blessing in disguise, because the portion was huge with more duck meat than a typical raviolo could hold. All the dishes were very well-seasoned, and the presentations were simple but beautiful. The food really speaks for itself.For dessert, we had a good crême brûlée and a tatin-style pie. The pie was a variation on a true tarte tatin: the same preparation of apples served on a puff-pastry shell that was baked separately. So it's not the same gooey caramelized pastry you get from the traditional dish, but it was delicious nonetheless. It was served with a dollop of very airy maple ice cream.The wine list had a good offering of wines by the glass. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience. I'd definitely go back."

I was looking for foie gras and this was the easiest way to get it close to my hotel and it was featured prominently in the menu. The interior was simple and modern with maybe 12 total tables and one waiter. I ordered the 35CAD dinner menu with the upcharge for foie gras and the duck. An amuse bouche and bread came out quickly and not long after I had my first taste of foie gras in too long. Unfortunately, it was duck and not goose and not as fatty as it could've been, but probably meant the animal wasn't mistreated as much? The duck breast was a big portion and came with a huge serving of fries and I wasn't close to finishing it. Dessert had two options and I had the creme brûlée, which was fine. Overall, a satisfying meal at the end of a long day of travel that could've been better but hit the spot."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A duck here, a duck there , everywhere a duck duck. This is the perfect place to experience this new found food. This beautiful quaint French Bistro serves different flavours and styles of duck. It's located at the edge of the tourist area in Old Montreal. The staff are friendly and will answer all questions. Since this is new to my palate my lover chose all the lunch dishes. We started off with the pan seared fois gras, heaven! The main dish was a Smorgasbord of duck served 5 different ways delicatessen style. Wow! Duck confit which the skin was very crispy, duck de Margret, very popular and the last were fois gras with lightly toasted baguette and duck tartare. Btw.. we also had the duck gizzards served in a delicious salad. I loved it and loved the company I was with. I finished off with a cappuccino and creme Brûlée. A place to visit...."

I was travelling solo and decided to give this place a try as it was conveniently located near my hotel. From the moment I walked in the restaurant I was deeply impressed by the warm welcome and quality of food offered by this establishment. My server was Manal and she was impeccable. I ordered foie gras torchons (18CAD) and a magret de canard (27 CAD) and even though I ended up rolling back to the hotel rather than walking because of all the food, it was well worth the experience."

/user_details?userid=lm3iGBAttDhhYfqk-ygFLA,Mrs. B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Had a fabulous meal here! found this gem just down the street from our hotel and by the name I knew they had to have duck on the menu, which is one of the food items I really wanted to have while visiting Montreal. I was in heaven with the multiple foie gras options. Our waitress recommended a delicious wine to go with our duck entree. It was quiet the Wednesday evening we visited, we got great service and got to chat and get to know our sweet waitress.  Be aware the restaurant closes at 9pm and the kitchen at 8:15pm. We noticed a couple of parties tried to come in after 8:30pm and were turned away."

I love duck like a fat kid who loves... duck!Had a bit of time just before catching my train back home to finish off my food adventure weekend in Montreal.And is there a better way to conclude this trip than with duck?It was all very decent, but I was spoiled this past weekend with some of the places I managed to hit up and it might have skewed my perspective of this place.  You know, a bender in Montreal might just do that."

/user_details?userid=_A6YN3QNqC05ZL3bc4D4SA,Katie J.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",5 star rating,"Hands down best duck I've ever had was this duck breast. Tender like a medium rare ribeye, but with such a great savory/smokey/duck flavor that was so rich paired with a foie gras sauce that was reminiscent of one I had in Paris.Meal began with a duck pate on the house with pepper jam and started the dinner on a high note. Seared foie gras was melt in your mouth delicious, especially paired with a great salad and fig jam. Gizzard salad was made with incredibly fresh vegetables, but the meat left something to be desired. Salmon and risotto was also cooked beautifully and incorporated great olive oil flavor. Very impressed by the service given that one woman waited on the entire restaurant and never missed a beat."
/user_details?userid=4C2LycW0izAjm4UEtvIgcA,Rich H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Delicious duck and excellent service!  Duck confit from the reasonably priced lunch menu was tender and wonderfully rich - with most of the fat cooked out after long baking at low temperature.  Accompanying veggies and salad (in lieu of fries) rounded out the delectable meal.  Starter of fresh brocoli soup was excellent though a little too filling before the main course. French white and reds by the glass were well priced (CA$ 8) and tasty.  In all, a perfect lunch find for duck lovers.  I look forward to returning sometime for dinner."
/user_details?userid=_xWn57tbQ1nr39we2Wt_eQ,Mike B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"This incredible establishment lives up to its name. The menu is oriented around your favorite migratory water fowl. The confit de canard is just as good as you will encounter in France. The skin is fairly crisp, the meat is rich and moist, and most of the fat has melted. However if you are visiting from the states, have the magret du canard. It is the best example of the dish I have ever experienced: rich, meaty and quite medium-rare. The duck dishes are served with a generous portion of frites. A goblet of Grimbergen Double-Ambree goes very well with duck. It is strong and malty, more than a match for the noble canard."
/user_details?userid=n2aQ7H1073MlHZNdlycAPg,Vazha L.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"If you like Duck, this is the place to go. I have come here most every trip I've taken To Montréal. They serve Duck in all shapes and flavors and styles. It is a nice cozy little place. The waitress while a little busy has been here for several years and easily switches between French and English and knows just what you want from a few questions. The food portions are generous and tasty. If you coming in a date or with friends this is a place to go."

/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love duck!  Especially Chinese styled BBQ duck so this place that serves all things duck definitely piqued my interest!  Everything was wonderful. I ordered the duck magret which is sliced duck breast cooked medium rare...although tbh rare duck meat wasn't as good as I'd imagined...it still tasted wonderful, just that I now realize that I prefer fully cooked duck!  I saw they also have duck tartar but for me personally, I'll pass even though I love tartar.  The fries are cooked in duck fat so they have this golden slightly sweet flavor and go great with the foie gras sauce. Overall recommend, but next time, I'll ask for medium-well magret even if that's weird to ask for!  My dinner companion ordered the flawless duck confit and loved it so much she went again and had the same thing last week!"
/user_details?userid=54i3j60Vym1_bdIMY9H-Dg,Tim E.,"Plainfield, NJ",5 star rating,"Such a satisfying (and comprehensive) meal. I went with their prix fixe menu and chose a pan seared Foie Gras of Duck over greens (really, the star of the show), Magret de Canard (their signature dish) as the main course, and a Grand Marnier Crême Brûlée to finish. Pleasantly surprised, an offering of paté of canard to start, was on the house. While on the pricey side, a house which specializes in just canard is going to do you right, assuming that this is what you're looking for. Its hard to describe the elements that make a dish so satisfying, especially when prepared in French fashion. Its the foie gras sauce and perfect sear on the duck skin, its the oil used to fry the french fries, its the buttery roasted veggies. Maybe it's the decadent sear on the foie gras, topped on a subtly crisp baguette slightly softened by natural fatty oils, but protected by a thin fig spread. Whatever it is, it screams text book French attention to detail. The only peculiarity is the portion size. This is American specification in terms of quantity. Its too much, and too good. A lot of damage was done tonight. Lastly, the Crême Brûlée-Grand Marnier was silky smooth under hardened caramelized shell. The slightest hint of GM was noted, and balanced. I don't want to be pushed over the line by a dessert, and this selection did me just right. I will be coming back again, be sure!"

My family and I came here for dinner and it did not disappoint. We got 2 of the duck confit (the skin was so crispy) and 2 of the fioe gras 3 ways (it was so perfect!). Our waitress was amazing. She knew that a wine she had just gotten in wasn't ready, so she gave us a different comparable bottle. It is a small quaint restaurant, very casual setting. I wish I lived closer to try more of their food. I'll definitely be going back on my next trip to Montreal."

Server was friendly and helpful and welcoming. My husband and I had different sets - both are amazing! For starter, the gizzard salad was interesting and tasty. I would recommend it over foie gras. For entree, we had confit and duck breast (cooked like a medium done steak). I found the confit is a bit dry, but I loved the duck breast!! Both desserts were very good. Lots of food, in the end we were stuffed. We paid $120 for two including tips and taxe"

/user_details?userid=wnlAu7zds5g5uss9TDzhNQ,Karen H.,"Cavendish, VT",5 star rating,"Two of us had dinner here while in the city for a weekend. I always long for duck in Montreal and it seemed like the right spot just outside of Old Montreal. The space is open, warm and inviting without being loud or touristy. The hostess greeted us with a smile and offered us a nice window table. The menu is full of duck prepared almost any way you can imagine along with choices for those who for whatever crazy reason might prefer something else. My companion had chicken while I began with foie gras prepared 3 different ways - heaven! Followed by perfect duck confit then Grand Marnier creme brûlée for dessert. We shared a lovely bottle of French Cahors that was so good we brought several bottles back home. The service was unobtrusive but friendly. It was the best meal of our weekend and my new favorite restaurant in the downtown area. Maison du Margret is highly recommended if you're looking for some locally sourced duck while in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=Iw-5njhQu0Lk5h4N-NZK8g,Daniel N.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"This place is a mecca for duck lovers; very French style restaurant near to the Old Town. Charming place - not high end restaurant but simple bristo like decor - with some very friendly staff. A house which specializes in canard is going to do you right, assuming that this is what you're looking for. They have many creative ways offering duck (duck salad, tartare, soup, selection of foie gras, confit, magret and so on). The presentation is very cute, the tastes pure and beautiful. The treatment of the dishes is superb and you will find perfectly cooked duck! The magret du canard was rich, meaty and quite medium-rare. The duck dishes are served with a portion of home made fries and all the portions are generous by French standards. The staff only spoke French, but they made the effort to try to understand, they were friendly and helpful."

We came in right before they closed for lunch but they still took us anyway! That was very sweet of them and our hungry bellies appreciated it! In one word: perfection. The food was beautifully presented and it was extremely tasty. The staff was very friendly. The entire restaurant has a unique take. They come from the south of France. They have a tv playing with different sports popular in France. The restaurant is elegantly decorated and I loved being there.

I had a promotion for a 4 course meal and was not disappointed. Rillettes avec gelée de piment d'espelette (spécialité des pays basques), salade landaise (gésiers), magret et tarte tatin were all very good. They have this south west of France/rugby/pays basque vibe going on. My friend who is from that region was pleasantly surprised. Waitress was overwhelmed but still gave us a good service. You can buy certain products on the post. Been there twice, would def go back."

/user_details?userid=Bveyuu-GqeQMf8ereY2I2g,Sabrina N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had purchased a coupon on Groupon to give this place a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The waitress was extremely nice and patient. We started off with the mini rillettes; absolutely delish!! I had the Confit sleeve; reminded me of KFC fried chicken which in my books is NOT a bad thing. I also had a little sample of the torchon de fois gras which was spectacular! For the main course I had the duck marget with foie gras sauce. Keeping in mind that I've never actually had duck breast before until that night, I had a bit of a hard time getting it down. But it can also be because I'm a crazy and felt like the duck was SUPER rare. My boyfriend had the duck burger with foie gras. I was told it was wonderful but extremely heavy.As if all that food was no enough, we finished our ultra light supper with dessert. I sampled both the Grand Marnier crème brulee and the Tarte Tatin. It's either because I'm not a huge dessert person or the fact that I ate about 17 pounds of duck but the dessert wasn't for me. The crème brulee was TOO ""Grand Marnier-ish"" (yes there is such a thing) and the Tarte Tatin was like a brick in my stomach.Once I've digested the 17 pounds of duck, I would definitely go back! But for the moment, I need to stick to salads."

There was only one server, Mathilde, for the whole restaurant of 13 or more tables... We had reservations at 7:30pm and she didn't come around to take our order until 8pm! The server was very cautious to point out to us that on the receipt, a 15% tip was recommended.. Considering we waited so long and were getting bored/hungry, we left about 12%... After we paid, she then had the nerve to say AGAIN, ""Just to let you know, this number here on the receipt, that's 15%."" Um... Okay...? I worked as a server for a long time and I'm a good tipper, but this is bad taste. The tip you get is based on the work you do. In North America anyway. I lived in France for a year, and I know they're used to a full salary no matter how good or bad the service they give is."

The foie gras was perfect, plated with just a hint of sea salt alongside a fig chutney over a lightly toasted baguette. The duck confit with foie gras sauce left such a delicious taste that I ""almost"" didn't want to ruin with an amazing piece of chocolate cake, but it came with that very well worth it prie fix ($35 + 15 for the foie gras). Your palette can't afford not to eat here multiple times."

We also ask the waitress to recommend wines to go with our meal. The meal was fantastic. The Foie Gras is the best I've ever taste, and the wine went really well with it. (I am from NY, and I've tried Foie Gras in many different places as it's my favorite French food) The only caution is that the meal portion is HUGE. The waitress actually warned me when I order both the Foie Gras and the duck 5-ways, and suggested that I should change it to the smaller portion, but I didnt listen. :) I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."
