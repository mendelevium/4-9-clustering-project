Montreal outings are not frequent hehe!We got lucky and got a table for the same night, but at 9:30! Given that I get to bed... erm... early, I knew I couldn't eat too much. Still, my onion soup was great and my grilled roman letuce was really good.I will go again for sure, and bring friends so they can discover this awesome small place!"

/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to Hachoir for the first time with my boyfriend for our anniversary because he was craving a steak while I wanted other options. We went at 9 pm on a Tuesday night so it wasn't crowded at all and the fact that it closes late is awesome. I love how the place feels cozy, local and rustic all at once. They opened all their windows and by sitting next to one, it felt like we were on a terrasse. I had the gin gin mule cocktail which is one of the best drinks I've ever had! I love gin and mixing it with ginger ale while having an after taste of mint and vanilla is an amazing combination. For supper I had the trio of tartare, including salmon, tuna and beef (they were out of duck). I couldn't believe it came with fries AND salad! They also give the option of sweet potato fries at no additional cost which is rare at a restaurant! My favourite was the tuna tartare hands down. The waiter also brought us more croutons which didn't cost extra. My boyfriend got the filet mignon which was cooked well and the mashed potatoes with oven baked cheese is delicious. The vegetables that accompanied the dish was only peppers so it would be better if they served at least 2 types of vegetables. Overall, I love how well they take care of their customers and would definitely return!"
/user_details?userid=V6MsTK2hkVOMqilpcZpb1A,Yu Z.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a hot summer night to try their tartare trio. Although the place was bustling with people and celebrations, me and my friend still managed to get a table. To my surprise, service was attentive/helpful and we did not feel left out despite the multiple birthday celebrations going on in the back of the restaurant. Food was good, not great. It was certainly an interesting meal, having Asian mixed along with American flavours. Although not the best tartare I ever had, it was enjoyable and I would recommend the Trio for anyone indecisive and who's curious to have a bite of everything.I am eager to come back to try their burgers, and the trendy atmosphere of the restaurant is a sweet bonus. *Beware of the bathrooms, there are only two of them, and you have to wait quite a bit even if you only want to wash your hands. To keep in mind that it is not convenient for a burger joint."
/user_details?userid=6zcsvCkZAlW8xJQ9vCWqYQ,Laurie D.,"Quincy, MA",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I walked by this restaurant and thought it was a super cool bar/restaurant with a nice ambience. We tried the salmon tartare, filet mignon with mashed potatoes and zucchini/tomatoes, and the 10 oz black angus filet with fries and salad. The service here was excellent! The waiter and waitress refilled our water whenever it was low. One of my pet peeves at restaurants is having to ask for more water. Thus, the staff here was very attentive! The filet mignon and black angus filet was a little on the rare side even though we asked for medium rare. Additionally I wasn't a fan of the suggested miso butter. The sauce got on my vegetables which added a nice dressing taste to it, but it didnt taste very good on my steak. Thankfully, I was able to brush it off the top and enjoy my filet mignon still. The salmon tartare and all the sides were delicious. My favorite was the mashed potatoes that had melted cheese on top and thick pieces of potatoes inside. The roasted zucchini and tomatoes were a great addition, except I wish there was more seasoning on the tomatoes. My overall food experience would be an 8.5/10 and the service was a 10/10!"

The staff was attentive and fast.The brie appetizer was fantastic. I had the trio tartare. I preferred the salmon but I liked them all. The bread that came with it was a bit too hard though. My boyfriend had the wapiti burger and he was impressed! Very good food; definitely worth the price.
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for lunch on a stressful day for me. It was a nice place overall and the atmosphere was relaxing. The decor is old school with wood everywhere, wobbly tables and a very weird but antique robot looking light in the kitchen. They have a a very nice selection of gin&Tonic with lots of local products. You can built your own by choosing your gin and your tonic. The end result was satisfying.I had the poutine with duck. I've never had anything with duck that wasn't tasty. It's my favorite animal to eat and it had its place as the star in that plate. My friends all had burgers, different kinds but they all seems good and very fulling. Especially, the one with onion rings in it. very decadent. Nobody finished his or her plate as it was way too big for lunch but we were still pleased."
/user_details?userid=O7D1Sl3e7UaI_pjjL1HJ-A,Tim L.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I had wanted to try the place out for some time now but never had the chance. I ordered tge calamari which chipotle mayo which was absolutely amazing. Lots of places serve calamari but few do it well. Not too chewy,  small bites with a great dipping sauce. Try it. For the main,  I got a straight ahead cheese burger which came with fries and a salad. The salad was incredible (ya, that's right, I said it), fries were home cut and the burger was tasty. Service was great,  ambience was hipster-cool.... without being hipster-douche. Fine line. Great place to grab drinks AFTER dinner too. I'll go back to try their famed steak or salmon tar tar."
/user_details?userid=jzV56K7A_mx3y3Eh7YG26g,Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",4 star rating,"We ended up at Hachoir, accidentally, when Pied du Cochon was too crowded for us to get in. The experience was delightful, we definitely enjoyed our evening. While I haven't eaten as much tartare as I would like to have (it's not very prevalent in the US), the tasting platter was enjoyable. A couple of the additions to the tartare, though, were almost too overpowering for the delicate fish underneath it. My husband had the slider tasting platter--and enjoyed all three of them. He said that the pork burger, while he might not have ordered it on it's own, was phenomenal and he was glad that he got to taste it. We started with the grilled ceasar, and that was delicious. I've made them myself, and there's something about a little bit of char on a romaine head that takes a salad from ""meh,"" to ""whoa!""Beer selection is average, but they have an adult coffee that was out of this world. Definitely give that a try if you're looking for a nightcap. The service was excellent, no complaints there. And while many seem to not like the atmosphere, I found it to be industrial, dim, and warm, all at the same time. Priceym, though, total with drinks for two was about $117 before tip. Definitely wouldn't be a frequent place to eat, but I enjoyed the experience."

I find the decoration very interesting and the ambiance seeing from outside seems pretty amazing. A little bit disappointed, though. Not too much.The sangria is delicious. A must try if you are looking for something refreshing. The Poutine was huge and very well served. Good option for groups. The burgers are also well served (lot of fries on side) but I feel that I wasn't amazed by the food. The boeuf one had a strong taste... Not my type. I tried the Piri Piri one, with chicken and chorizo. Found it ""ok"". Nothing special. ServiceCould be a little bit more fast. Beer took longer than usual and burgers took too long to arrive. I also ordered a burger without avocado and guess... It came with avocado. But this time they managed the issue very fast. Good job! Also... I've brought my American friends with me and there was no menu in English. So I had to explain each item... Oh boy...Overall... I think my expectation was too high and it made me be disappointed. Please take note that It doesn't mean that I don't recommend the restaurant... It's just a matter of being aware of what to expect. If by any chance I come back, it certainly will be for the sangria."

As everything is fresh it's a bit pricey but in tartar it has to be super fresh ! I suggest you take the tasting menu with beef, salmon and tuna, and i like everything as it was so fresh and well prepared that it eat by itself !I think this is the place to eat tartar in Montreal, but as i'm not a big tartar fan i have to try other restaurant but for me it will be hard to do better !Si vous aimez le tartar c'est l'endroit à Montreal. Même si c'est un peu cher, comme le tartare doit être extra frais la viande ou le poisson doivent être super frais. Je vous suggère d'essayer le menu dégustation avec du boeuf, du saumon et du thon. J'ai bien aimer tout ce qu'il y avait dans mon assiette car tout étaient tellement frais et extrêmement bien préparés que ça se mangeait tout seul !Je ne suis pas un grand amateur de tartare mais j'ai bien aimé le hachoir !"
/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After having read and seen so many wonderful photos and reviews, I was quite exited to try Hachoir. Sadly, my excitement disappeared by the end of our meal. This is why...On Dec 31st at 1:20pm, we(Two people) arrived at the restaurant. We were there for about 90 minutes. During those 90 minutes, we were still only two people in the entire restaurant. Strange and not comfortable eating at such an empty ambiance. Anywho. We begun our meal with an appetizer of fried calamari. Oh my! They were perfect! Calamari is hard to prepare and often have a tough/rubbery texture to them if not cooked properly. Rest assure, these were perfectly tender, smooth with a lovely light coating on the outside. Served on a delicious saffron mayo. Excellent! Now for the main dishes. Knowing their tartare is their specialty, we went ahead and ordered the Boeuf Classicique. Which is none other than the classic tartare along with a few condiments to compliment the meat. The tartare was outstanding. Meat tasted extremely fresh, perfectly chopped with the right touch of condiments. While you can still taste the meat. Beautifully presented along with thinly slice toasts. They were toasted awhile back, they lacked a bit of freshness. Although the tartare was outstanding, the presentation spoke a bit louder than the meal. As for myself, I've ordered the classic burger. A generous meat patty that seemed just made and meat was just grounded. It screamed freshness. Decorated with your few typical burger accoutrements. Such as onions, tomatoes, a lovely tender crisp Boston lettuce. All this served alongside of a generous outstanding fries. Freshly cut, made and prepared when ordered. What is the negative part of all this to give it three stars? As previously mentioned we were a table of two people for the entire restaurant. Along with two staff members, not including the cooks. All this being said.. Our meal did take 45 minutes to arrive to our table. Not once did our waiter apologized or notified us of any delay. The waiting time for a simple, not overly complicated meal for just two people is simply unacceptable! When it came time to pay, their credit card machine did not work. No one bothered to notified us prior to paying. They had to reset their entire system and that was another 10 minute wait. Overall our lunch was excellent. However the restaurant and staff was very poorly prepared for serving us. A disappointment that will make me think twice whether I would return or recommend Hachoir to others."
/user_details?userid=tcDMAC6kvF0iN-kqcjD5Dg,Crystal P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They do make a tastey burger. The meat was juicy and tender. It wasn't a huge burger so you don't look like a slob eating it! Good fries too. Comes with side salad with a simple vinaigrette. I had to wait 40 minutes for the burger, that's too long. Got a bloody Caesar pitcher, was good but a bit too spicy. Maybe best to have one instead of a pitcher. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and good service."

We were lucky to get a place at the bar without a reservation on a Thursday night around 6:00 PM. Every table had a reserved sign on it, and the place was packed by the time we left!I enjoyed the gin gin mule and the tartare trio (beef, salmon, tuna). The flavours were very powerful and nicely complemented one another. My dad had the burger trio which he found to be excellent. The menu states that dishes come with salad and your choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. I asked for regular fries and ended up with just fries and no salad. I asked for a salad and quickly received it without issue.Service was not quick, but I found our server to be very attentive. I watched her most of the night and I was amazed by how efficiently she multitasked making all of the bar drinks, keeping the bar contents stocked, taking orders and checking on bar customers, etc. Its a pricey dinner but I found the food and the experience to be worth it!"

/user_details?userid=H6eXXqGuxDk6RYdZZk81dQ,Emma E.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Hachoir is everything I would want for a relaxing night out. The food here is delicious and extremely well priced. The crowd and atmosphere had a really casual vibe and they played really great music! The service was also very friendly. I came here at 11 pm with three others and we tried the Kensington beef tartar, tuna tartar, calamari and French onion soup. The tartars came with a salad and fries and we upgraded the fries to a poutine and sweet potato fries. My absolute favourite was the beef tartar. The Kensington came with mushrooms, chives, truffle oil, mayo topped with Parmesan cheese. The flavours all worked so well together and didn't take away from the flavour of beef. This is the best tartar I have ever had. This is a definite must! The tuna tartar was equally delicious and super fresh. I don't usually like tuna unless it's extremely fresh and it was super fresh. The salad came dressed in a delicious vinaigrette and the fries were your typical fries. The poutine was light yet flavourful. I loved the French onion soup here. It was a little on the salty side, but I couldn't stop eating it. It had tons of cheese that lasted to the very end. The one disappointing dish was the calamari. It was dry and seemed like it came out of the freezer. I didn't eat much of it and just enjoyed the beef tartar. Yum! I left wanting more."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic burgers and beef tartare (and I'm not even a tartare person!). You can tell that the meat that they are using is very high-grade and they mince it themselves here. I had finished an afternoon of running errands and found myself in this neck of the woods and feeling somewhat famished. I'm glad I came here.Place is pretty chill, the staff are young and friendly and the location kind of made me a wee-bit nostalgic. It sits on the literal corner of Rachel and St. Denis in a building that once housed old-school alternative club ""Le Lezard"" up on the second floor.  Many an evening was spent there in my misspent youth spotting the likes of Jean-Paul Gauthier or model Eve Salvail while dancing to industrial...but back to Hachoir.Hachoir offers old school brasserie dishes, nothing really innovative (except maybe the foie-gras sliders I saw on the menu- a try for next time), just solid stand-bys which have withstood the test of time. They also have a great wine list as well. I wouldn't hesitate in the least in coming back here either for a lunch or dinner with a friend."

I wasn't really sure what she meant but this cozy diner like place was out of this world good. Yes, most of their plates are tartar of tuna, salmon or beef but they have tastefully spiced & arranged your choice served with french fries & salad with toasted baguettes.  If you don't like raw fish/meat they also serve salads & burgers!!The ambiance is very french & if you are visiting Montreal this is a must see!!"

We ordered the slider trio- chicken, pork and beef. The sliders were tender, well cooked, and flavorful. One thing of note is the waiter did not ask how I wanted my burger. The beef patty was served medium, I would have preferred medium rare, but it wasn't a big deal. We stayed away from any alcohol, and the waiter was kind enough to continuously fill our glasses.Although we didn't try it ans can't vouch- many patrons seemed quite satisfied with their tartars and fois gras. The atmosphere, was a club meets high-end tavern. It was definitely dark, and EDM like music played on the house speakers.  Hachoir is probably an excellent drinks out with the girls spot. They are open til midnight almost every night of the week, and you can book reservations on their website. Walk-ins are welcome. Jason L and I did not have a hard time snagging a table at 10pm on a Sunday night. I'd go back."

/user_details?userid=rFUE7QepJaxOpQsb40c9hw,Catherine D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My girlfriend and I had a reservation at 9PM on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed- as expected. It took a good 25min for us to get our table... Apparently they were late on reservations because some people showed up later and bla bla. They apologized, we understood. But then it took 15 minutes for our server to come ask us if we wanted something to drink, and a good 50 minutes to get the food we ordered... The tartare tasting plate and a filet mignon. Kind of unacceptable. The tartare was really good. My girlfriend doesn't usually like beef tartare and she loved that one- so I'll give them that. The fries were okay, the salad was nothing special. And the filet mignon was mediocre. The sauce au poivre was really salty and the piece of meat had hard tendons inside... I even had to chew out a piece at what point (how embarrassing). Definitely not worth 35$.Our server ended up giving us the 2 drinks we ordered for free because of how slow the service was. Nice gesture. Overall, go for the tartare. And try to choose a time that's not too busy because they definitely can't handle serving their restaurant when it's at its maximum capacity.Ambiance wise, they play pretty good music and it's kind of loud but not too much. Would be the perfect spot for a first date if the food and the service delivered."

It was more like lime puree with a side of raw salmon than salmon tartare. There were HUGE chunks of lime mixed in with the fish, and some lime juice as well, which just overpowered the entire dish making it a very bitter experience (literally and figuratively).I did try some mashed potato from a friend, and it was quite good, but that isn't really the measure of a good experience in my books. I know that they have a lot of good reviews, so maybe I just happened to go on an off night, or maybe I need to learn to eat my tartare drenched in lime, but either way, I'm definitely not going back..."

After trying to go to 3 or 4 different places, all of which were closed we were starting to become a group of grumpy people. Then we saw Hachoir, and it was open!We started with a Caesar salad which was crunchy, creamy and delicious. Thanks to the salad were no longer grumpy and now a group of friends enjoying a pleasant meal together. The four of us were all attracted to the same items on the menu, the boys had the crab cake burger and the girls the salmon burger. Be sure to have your napkin handy as these burgers can create a bit of a messy situation. The burgers were very good as were the fries. Overall the menu looked interesting with many creative twists such as a duck confit poutine and the Panche burger which is dressed with bbq sauce and an onion ring.

I must say that I had a first great experience as the service, and the ambiance was good.When you look at the menu, and the restaurant itself, you are expecting to get an astonishing dinner, but I was a bit disappointed: the food was good, but not more. As an appetizer, we took some calamari that were good, but a bit salty. For the main plate, I took a filet mignon: the baking was good, but the lack of flavor upset me at a point where I had to use some pepper sauce. I never put any dressing when I'm eating a good piece of meat, so it's never a good thing when I'm doing it. Maybe I wasn't lucky, as I tasted the salmon tartar of my friend, and it was amazing.One of the things that I liked in restaurant during summer, is their terrace. Hachoir don't have one, but they have wall size windows that make you feel like you were outside. It was perfect for yesterday cool, and windy evening.So at the end, a good ambiance, in a good location, with some good food. I'll definitely give another try to this restaurant in a near future to get some good fish tartar."

It's always nice to give a new restaurant a second shot if they don't blow you away the first time around. I've had the tartare and it was very good. But what really surprised me was the burger. Now it's not that hard to make a good burger, yet a lot of places seem to have trouble doing it. Hachoir nailed it!The location is also great. And the coolest thing about this restaurant is the old operating room light that hangs over the kitchen. It's awesome! Just don't let your mind wander the way mine did.

/user_details?userid=ikHTdbcQrKNVvnyetPvTIg,Monica N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"For a long time, I was a little reluctant to go to Hachoir due to many people saying it was pricey. Already, that's a bit of a turn off. For a burger, I'm not going to go drop 25$ on a beer and some sort of edible something between two buns. However, on this night I had some extra money and I figured "" Treat yo' self."" Upon entering the venue, I thought it was kind of dark inside. The clientele was young-ish, minus the couple next to us on a date in their mid-forties where the guy was talking about the size of his you-know-what the whole time to his date. Overall though, the vibe was okay and the hockey game was on so my boyfriend was stoked. The bathroom and restaurant in general was clean which can stand to the illusion that it's a good sign. I started with a Griffon Rousse, their beer selection was ""meh"" but they had a more eclectic wine list so I should of ventured that route if I really wanted to be judgy. However, my boyfriend ordered an old fashioned and it was delicious. Their menu is small so I say this to all vegetarians who decide to eat at this place: you really have no other choice than to order their veggie burger, ""Le Végétal"" (as for vegans, don't go here). This burger is a breaded portobello mushroom, stuffed with cheese and comes topped with a house green-pepper mayo, lettuce, tomato and cucumbers. Now, first of all, when it comes to eating portobello mushroom burgers, I am always a little worried. They are slimy. Their texture when cooked is gross. They don't absorb taste. At Hachoir, I was ready to embark on this journey only because they had stuffed the portobello with cheese and it was breaded. However, I didn't even taste any cheese in my burger. If it was there, it must of been overcome by the taste of bread but I don't even think that's possible. Oh yeah, upon first bite to last, eating this burger was a total battle. Despite being ""breaded"" the portobello started slipping out of the bun immediately. I spent more time trying to find the cheese in my burger and then readjusting my patty than enjoying my eating experience at all.I played with my food from ages birth to 3 years old... It wasn't the place or the time to do it. The fries, on a side note, were okay. The side salad was weak, but I've never been to a restaurant where I've gotten a side salad and said, ""WOW! What an amazing side-salad!"" That just never happens. Needless to say, I was disappointed (and once again correct about the portobello being a total fail choice for a vegetarian burger) by the food but the service was good, the restaurant was clean, and the dude next to us talking about his woohoo was entertaining to say the least."

Fries were average to bad. GF had pasta and she loved it. Friends had steak tartare and filet mignon they were good but not amazing. Price was fair, so I guess we wouldn't mind eating there again if we are in the area and we are lazy about going somewhere else. The service made the difference, Canada seems to be pretty terrible service wise, this place was well above average, for that reason I give it four stars."

The food was outstanding, the service was good (although on the slower side), and they even found us a table for four on busy night without a reservation. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=SE0KcwPmqFbACAQI8UQoeg,Shan X.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was fine, but the service was awful. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had service-wise. Our waiter, Carlos, served one of our party over 20 minutes before the rest. Even after the person waited patiently for the rest of us to receive our food, she still had the time to finish her then cold meal before ours was served. When we asked him about it, he claimed he made an error and not once apologized to the person. It seemed especially disingenuous because until then, he kept telling us our food was on the way and we kept seeing other tables served instead of ours. He also made numerous errors with the bills adding items that had never been ordered.To add the icing on the cake, we were there for someone's birthday and Carlos brought his dessert while he was still eating his salad. When he realized his error he asked if he could just take his salad away instead of apologizing!The food was good, but definitely didn't make up for the horrible service."

So I came here, and tried the trio tartare. It was excellent. I was alone, so I was a little nervous going in with my dirty winter boots in a fancy restaurant full of lovely French speaking couples... But I was seated at the bar, and my waiter was very sweet and attentive. He helped me choose a wine that was complex in flavor, to pair with my tartare of meat and fish. It was delicious! Each was flavored with distinct spices and herbs. I especially loved the salmon tartare. I will come back here, hopefully with somebody!"

However, everything on their menu is excellent. One of the best tartars I have had in the city. I highly recommend the calamari!Can be a bit pricey, but if your looking for something worth it, this is the place!"

We had lunch: excellent veggie (chickpea) burger, and a very good classic beef burger. Excellent fries, though plain mayo didn't match the rest of the plate. Very good salad and blue cheese appetizer as well."

The ambience...it looked like one of those dimly lit fancy places. We ordered the Salmon Tartare and the New York Steak. We told the waiter to do the steak medium rare. The food came pretty quickly and the presentation was quite good too. The taste...not so much. My tartare tasted like onions and lime. Don't get me wrong, there was lots of Salmon but the onions overpowered it. The steak was cooked a bit too much and the fries were just meh. The food was pretty expensive too ($22 for tartare and $29 for steak). I would spend my money on something better the next time."

We were trying to find a place to eat and if one place was too chic, the other was divey, one too expensive, but the other not special enough etc..Hachoir reeled my parents in thanks to it's lunch menu featuring flank steak. Mmmm flank steak. The place is cute but modern, everything is squarish and black with solid wood tables (which are the IT item of the season, along with blackboards it seems), also they have a pretty cool bar design! The waiter was really overzealous in selling us his menu: Everything's bio! Everything's local! Alrighty, then love! My mom gave the tuna tartare a go, and it was, fresh and summery but not spectacular. My dad's flank steak was a bit overcooked tough, Sacrilege! My Hachoir 2.0 burger was the best.thing. ever. Served on a bamboo plate but of course.I'm not a burger aficionado. I know you guys are out there, measuring the patty's thickness, the bun's subtle aromas. I know nothing of that, but that was a goood burger. Shrimp and pork are mashed together to form the patty, which is served under pineapple slices, red lettuce, sweet mayonnaise and veggies. Not too big, not too small, totally delicious. The sides are worthy of note as well: you can choose whether you want either a salad, fries, or both, so as to not waste any food! Yes! +1 star to avoid food waste!!  Both sides are just that, sides, perfect portion control here. The fries are freshly made and well seasoned. Nothing is sadder than a dry salad, and this little one was crying oily tears of joy! I'll be back to try their deer burger for sure!PS:noise and pollution level might be a bit high during the day, since all the 10 wheelers deliver the St-Denis goods right next to the windows :/"

Me and my girlfriend were craving steak tartare,  I had just received a newsletter telling me about this recently opened restaurant and I happen to live nearby.The restaurant has a simple design, yet quite modern. There are is lot of dark wood, mirrors and visible pipes. The wine list is quite nice and the menu features mainly burgers and tartares.Don't expect simple Angus burgers -- this new place offers pork, lamb, venison, even a crab cake burger straight off the chopping block. I didn't try them but they look amazingI had the venison tartare which was excellent. You can tell that the meat is of really good quality. It has a smokey taste that not everyone will like tho. My girlfriend had the beef tartare, which was outstanding and full of flavor.Only minus is that I thought the service was a little bit slow and the dessert menu a little average. I will however definitely come back tho."
/user_details?userid=W3Wvaf8YoFH-cnjVil4tNw,Jenna M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,They removed my favourite item off the menu! RIP crab burger. I will mourn you. I plan on going back eventually to try their other burgers but it will never be the same. Their tartare is alright. Centrally located on Saint-Denis (good luck finding parking) and the decor is nice. Great for a date or between friends.

They served beef and salmon tartare hors d'oeuvres as well as mini-burgers. I didn't try the burger because I don't eat bread and wouldn't know what to do with the left over bun while I'm standing up, glass of wine in hand. But it looked good nevertheless.It was everything I like:LOUDFrenchbeautiful peopleclean bathroomsopened kitchentrendydid I say LOUD pretty people?"

/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is the kind of place that looks like it would be exceptional, but, doesn't quite deliver. Tried it twice and both times were ok. The place looks cool and the staff and clientele look cool as well. Crab cakes were good. Salmon Tartar just ok. Tuna Tartar was very oily. The second time around  had the trio of mini-burgers: they were good, but, not worth the return visit. If anything Hachoir is a good first date place for people with some extra cash to burn."
