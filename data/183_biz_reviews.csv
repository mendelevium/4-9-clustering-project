/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered food over the weekend and got them within one hour (well the restaurant is on St-Cath and I am located at 1650 Cedar, it doesnt take crazy Mario Bros race to get the food delivered uphill). Kinka is found on DoorDash, Uber Eat and much more. Their takeout menu is quite interesting, I ordered Karaage (deep fried duck (?!) or chicken), salmon salad, salmon rice and salmon sushi. To wrap up the meal, we ended, me and my love, with our delicious and smooth matcha cheese cakes. The food arrived at the hospital warm and yummy. The staff drew me a cat on the delivery bag wishing me ""Bon appetit"", its absolutely adorable. I decided to stick that cat on the fridge of the 4West psychiatric unit to commemorate this unforgettable meal that I shared with so many lovely patients and my love. Thank you Kinka! Continue your great work!"

I live in Ontario and it's my first time visiting the Montreal location, a bit disappointed they don't serve the Kakimayo (baked oyster) but that was okay. We ordered the sashimi salad, karaage, unagi bibimbap, kimchi udon and a few mores and it was so delicious. The servers were all great!"
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute Japanese izakaya on Sainte Catherine Street! The staff greet you warmly in Japanese when you enter and when you leave. There is a wide selection of beers, sake, cocktails, and virgin cocktails. The food menu mostly consists of small tapas, but there are also bigger dishes like udon, ramen, and bibimbap. It's a bit on the pricey side (6-10$ for tapas, 10-13$ for slightly bigger dishes that aren't that filling either) so don't go there if you're on a budget! On average you'll probably spend about 35$ per person, not including tax and tips. I ordered the takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and vegetarian bibimbap (which was rice with cheese, mushroom, and seaweed in a hot stone pot). Food tasted great!"

/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",4 star rating,"4 stars for eating on the terrasse. 3 stars and under if eating inside. You'll notice the good reviews to this place mostly come from a younger crowd. That's because older people walk in...and then walk out. It is so friggen loud in there it's not funny. In regards to the indoor volume: it's a narrow space with tall ceilings so sound travels in an echoey-boom kinda way yet you can barely hear the person sitting in front of you and have to basically yell at each other. The music is weird hip-hop type beats (possibly Japanese but probably not from what I could hear of it) and is blasted at an uncomfortable level yet still muffled/inaudible by the pervasive general noise of this whole place. Everytime a new guest enters the restaurant the whole staff waves at them and yells a Japanese greeting (which despite hearing it like 50 times I still cannot figure out what they were saying and no one bothered to explain it to us). Needless to say we asked for our reserved indoor table for 4 to be moved to the outdoor terrasse within 5 minutes of our arrival. So kudos to them for accommodating. Once outside the atmosphere was much more pleasant to accommodate a 4 star review and we genuinely enjoyed our time there and the food. I would like to emphasize just how much inside truly SUCKS and would not merit more than 3 stars, again with the food being its' saving grace to not smack it with 2 stars.  The food is tapas style. We ordered plenty of different plates to share and most were quite good. We enjoyed almost everything we ate and nothing was left. I was a bit disappointed that despite ordering more than enough plates for our party of 4 I was still kinda hungry by the end and that's extremely weird for me, I usually feel full quite quickly. I should point out that while we ordered the black cod and octopus balls as being 2 of their specialty dishes, all 4 members of our party found that to be a flat out lie and we far preferred the other dishes. Most notably the beef ribs imo. One of my friends is not used to dining with me and she was quick to cut up and serve out the portions so photos were kind of a do-or-die situation lol. This is why there isn't photos of every plate we ordered haha. Besides which, this place boasts 1000+ photos, not sure they need any more lol. We did partake in the sake bomb tradition and they were sweet to accommodate me, since I don't drink beer they swapped out beer for gingerale for mine. We had a great time sharing plates and drinking cocktails, but when it was done I was still hungry and not at all drunk and we paid quite the pretty penny.I would visit again, but only on the terrasse and only for a couple of drinks and appetizers before an actual meal somewhere else."
/user_details?userid=EayhuSvyRgcNoDj5yaDMRQ,Kimbo S.,"Bulls Head, NY",3 star rating,"This was my first time in Montreal, and this place had decent reviews. This is not a place if you want to have a quiet meal. Every time someone walks in, the scream welcome in Japanese. Every time food is ready in the kitchen, they will scream. But this review is not about this. The dishes are tapas style, so they are shareable. The takoyaki was very good. Flavor was good, well filled with toppings, and sauce complemented it very well. The ""Hana"" drink was good, non alcohol, and had calpico in it. Everything else was kind of meh after that. The yaki udon had a very weird slimy consistency, like it was covered in starch, and the flavor was not there. The sashimi salad like only 3 piece of salmon in it. The short ribs had nice flavor, but there was no char, and there was a lot of fat on it. The hojicha brulee was half good. The brulee was a little weird, did not taste like green tea, more like a red bean. But the green tea ice cream was pretty good, but not sure if they made it on site. What really topped it off was that our Salmon was raw. My cousin and I don't eat raw fish. We ordered the special baked salmon with miso and mushrooms. The inside was completely raw. When we asked if it was supposed to be raw, the waitress did not know. Unless the salmon was sushi grade, people could get very sick from this. Overall, the atmosphere is loud, music is good. Food is average. Staff was very kind."
/user_details?userid=7FoE5PH5CV6I6ZEfxVG5rg,Kobsupang R.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I actually planned on having lunch at another Japanese place, but it was closed that day, so I started walking around and found Kinka Izakaya. First thing I did? I yelped this place and saw that it had pretty great reviews. That's all I needed to give this place a try. Because coming here was unplanned, I decided to play it safe and ordered a small plate first. I ordered vegetable croquettes with rice and had I known that they made the best croquettes, I would have ordered more! Because croquettes were more of a side dish, I worried I would be hungry before dinner so I ordered chicken karaage as a meal which came with miso soup. The chicken karaage wasn't so bad, either -- it was very crispy from the outside, but really soft and juicy once you take a bite of it. It was PRETTY hot it burned my tongue T__T. Miso soup wasn't so great as I found it pretty bland.What surprised me was when I asked for a check and it came with a small bowl of frozen grapes! At first I was reluctant to try, but after tasting the first one, oh man it was naturally sweet and I wish I could have had more! Forget about those regular candies or mints, this is awesome! Since it was my first time at Kinka, I had nothing to compare, but I love the time I went which was around 11 am ish and it wasn't so busy! The wait time wasn't so bad. Next time I'm in town, I may try their desserts, too!"
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I think I've really come to love Kinka....I love that there are specials monthly and daily. I get to try different items at every visit. They also have really good cocktails and I have not been disappointed at all. There are certain items that I wish I could order again right now, like the takoyaki...and the Yuzu cocktail (honestly, I'm dreaming of that)! Smaller plates mean you can share with your table-mates, or you can get some of the dishes like the ramen or rice bowls which are more for one. I've introduced my classmates to this spot as well because I think it needs to get more action on weekdays. Truth be told, it's not a perfect spot but it's charming and enjoyable, and it makes me want to come back each time I visit."
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,"I had this place bookmarked, it was right near our hotel, and it was open late, so it was the perfect dinner spot for us. My BF and I came in at around 10:45 on a Friday and there were a few groups having drinks. The vibe was kind of a party vibe, so if you're looking for a quiet place to talk to your date, this is probably not it.We decided to do the tasting menu because we couldn't decide on what we wanted. Everything sounded so good. For $35 pp, the menu includes:Takoyaki (fried octopus balls) - these were alright, but I'm not a huge fan of takoyaki to begin withGyu Carpaccio (seared beef sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo) - this was one of my favorites of the night. It was thinly sliced, which enhanced the flavor of the raw beefKinoko Bibimbap (rice, mushroom, and cheese with seaweed) - I really enjoyed this bibimbap, most likely because of the cheese. I wish it was served a bit earlier, and not as the last dish because were pretty full by the time it came out. Still ate everything thoughGomaae (blanched rapini with sesame sauce) - this was only okay, but I appreciated the fact that they threw in some veggiesKaki Mayo (baked oysters with spinach, mushroom, garlic mayo, topped with cheese) - when this came out, the cheese was still bubbling. This was another top contender of the night. Cheesy oysters? What's not to love?Salmon Tataki (seared salmon with ponzu and wasabi mayo) - basically the carpaccio from earlier but in salmon form. This was good too - no complaintsEbimayo (fried shrimp with spicy mayo) - this was probably the worst dish. The batter was way too thick, and it was also soggy. You could probably find better shrimp tempura in the freezer section of a CostcoGyu Shabu Salad (shabu shabu beef with greens and a black sesame dressing) - good way to balance out the heaviness of the other dishesKaraage (fried chicken with garlic mayo) - not the greatest chicken karaage, but not the worstIce cream (choice of matcha or sesame) - each of us ended up getting a different flavor, so that we could try bothWe also added on a special, which was 12 pieces of assorted sashimi for $36. While the fish was good, it was a bit pricey, considering a set menu per person is cheaper than that.For drinks, I had the yuzu cocktail (whiskey, yuzu, and ginger-ale). I didn't taste any alcohol in here but it tasted so good! It was nice and refreshing. We also did a sake bomb each ($5) which is a whole big spectacle here. Every time someone orders a bomb, the whole staff gathers round and screams sake bomb with you. I appreciated that it wasn't a huge glass of beer like it normally is in the US, because after eating all that food, I don't think a whole beer would have fit in my stomach.I would say the food was 4 stars but the overall experience (including the service) brought it to 5 stars. It was just a fun and chill atmosphere. We even wanted to come back Sunday night for a late night snack but they close early on Sundays (10:30). Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=3J8OoQEBaFQx6Ooyu3UkgA,Joyce A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I can't forget how their takoyaki taste like. It was so good it lingers in your mouth. It was freshly cooked you can tell. The ramen is ok not my fave. I tasted the bibimbaap and i liked it a lot.
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3 star rating,"+.5 for serviceI've been to Kinka several times in Toronto and this place was close enough to my hotel during my recent stay in Montreal. Since I'm an experienced Kinka diner, I came in knowing the atmosphere will be loud and there will be people shouting over one another.To my disappointment, the menu selection is significantly smaller. While their main menu is similar, there's far fewer specials than its Toronto sister branches. However the staples are there, and from my orders of okonomiyaki, takowasabi, ebimayo, and salmon oshizushi came with a similar food quality as Toronto's Kinka branches. Their drink selection was a lot bigger though, so it seemed they veered more towards drinks than food in this branch. Service was excellent, as is tradition with the other Kinka branches I've been to. It's a place nestled in an area with many bars, and it does stand out a bit in its uniqueness."
/user_details?userid=9qSNf8YBfA2Vdt_ikm1nkw,Eric H.,"Wilton, CT",5 star rating,"This was our first stop after we dropped our bags off at our downtown hotel, and everything we ate here was fantastic. It has an authentic Japanese izakaya feel, right down to our waiter shouting out our order in Japanese to the chefs in the open kitchen. You are even greeted with that traditional Japanese greeting when you walk in. Nice! My wife got the karaage combo, which is Japanese deep-fried soy sauce marinated chicken and comes with a healthy dollop of garlic mayo. This was some of the best karaage we've ever had. The dark meat chicken was so tender and juicy. The breading was flavorful and fried to perfection. SO GOOD! I ordered the yaki saba combo, which is grilled cured mackerel with a side of grated daikon radish and soy sauce. Again, perfectly cooked with that dense meaty quality that is the opposite of the flaky white fish cod I'm used to eating. SO GOOD! Even the traditional garden salad and miso soup were far better than what we're used to in Japanese restaurants. The dressing had this smoky profile, maybe from mirin or soy sauce. The flavors in both the salad and soup were bright and vibrant. SO GOOD!A great way to start our Montreal anniversary weekend. If you're in the area and love a good Japanese izakaya experience like I do, this is your spot!"
/user_details?userid=T6TInNEhz-qm5tT_ZjQEoA,Marcel M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I wanted sushi while on vacation in Montreal, but ended up with way more at Kinka Izikaya. The menu is large and diverse, from sushi to bibimbap, so it's great for groups with different tastes.We ordered the tasting menu, which included 8 small plates and ice cream for dessert - perfect for two people. All courses were duhlicious and the plates were decently sized - we left very full and unable to finish the last two courses.The service was attentive and friendly and spaced the courses well, at least until the very end. Before the ice cream arrived, we overheard our server saying that she was going on break, and we didn't see her again for 20 minutes. In the meantime, someone else refilled our water and, once we asked, brought our ice cream. It was an odd slip up in otherwise great service.The drink menu is also expansive with lots of unique cocktails. We knew about the saki bomb chant from other Yelp reviews, so we ordered them right away and enjoyed the entertainment that ensured. Most other patrons were in large groups ordering multiple saki bombs, which increased the noise level but did not bother us. The table next to us was visibly upset by the frequent chanting, and I can imagine that it would be disruptive if it's unexpected."
/user_details?userid=o3_t6wfB5BctyOQym_775g,Patrick B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This review is a bit late. Was there on September 20th. So... food was okay ... but there are much better Izakaya options out there. (including Kinoya, Ichigo Ichie, Imadake...)Service was inattentive with long periods of absence from our 2 servers.  My biggest  gripe is with the VOLUME OF THE MUSIC which is soooo loud you cannot even hear yourself think, let alone talk to your friends. Unlikely to re-visit."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Great and lively atmosphere. Note: the music is very loud, so keep that in mind. As with all Izakayas, the servers shout to welcome you in and to thank you for your business when you leave. So it's definitely not for everyone. I came in a group of 3 on Christmas Eve and we all had the set menu, which was delicious. Fairly decent value as well because I was very full by the end! I also had the Yuzu drink and it was light and refreshing. My friends ordered the Take and Tokyo--both of which were also fruity and refreshing. Service was friendly. I'll always be back!"

/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My 3 stars is really meant to be 3 1/2.I have been here many times for lunch. It's one of those places where you know exactly how the food is going to be like, and it's just convenient and easy. The staff is always nice, friendly and helpful. The terrace is definitely a bonus during lunch time. The food, like I mentioned, is fine. Nothing extravagant but definitely not bad either. (i isually take something light, like a sashimi salad, so it's hard to screw up as there is no cooking involved...)I would keep coming back here for lunch as they have an easy lunch menu, perfect for groups."
/user_details?userid=ZFxfMReOr2SFvSSRmGZ7Gw,Vikrant T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,There are a bunch of Japanese places in this neighborhood. This one is on the smaller side. The selection is limited but a good mix of variety. I found that the quality and taste of food here was better than other nearby izakayas. Less crowded and service is good too. Their drink options are also very interesting.
/user_details?userid=4ayVX0YKY3GSP2IICpLJXQ,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Quite similar to Guu in vancouver, this is a popular izakaya in Montreal. We ordered many dishes and they all tasted average, but nothing stood out. Sorry for the lack of details as this was a long time ago, but from what I remember, we got a sashimi salad, chicken kaarage, soft tofu soup, aburi oshi (salmon), kabocha croquette and short ribs. There was a special on the menu i remember very distinctly as it was tofu patties that were very mushy in texture.Overall, if you're looking for japanese food, its not bad but I wouldn't see it out when coming from Vancouver."

Not able to see anything outside. Felt a bit claustrophobic.Initially service was good and quick, but later when restaurant got filled up, the service became super slow. To get our bill, it took almost 20 minutes. But our waitress was sweet.Food was ordered from the lunch menu for two people: Vegetable Tempura, Salmon Tataki (including rice, Miso soup and Salad), and vegetables stuffed dumplings. The taste of all these dishes were average. It was super oily; I felt I ate more fat than the food. The prices were really reasonable for all these dish, as lunch menu was 30$ with tax and tips included. So that was wonderful."
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"Really awesome place! This is part of the franchise they have in Toronto. Visited on a Sunday evening and was seated right away. You are greeted immediately upon entering in Japanese by all staff members. They shout to get each other's attention so be prepared for that (it caught me off guard the first time). The staff are super friendly and will answer any questions you may have. I decided on the torched ozisushi and kinoko bibimbap (basically my staple items here at Kinka). The dishes were served promptly and piping hot. He served asked if I wanted my rice mixed for me but I declined as I wanted to do it myself. I also asked for spicy sauce and without hesitation they brought it. The serving size of the salmon ozisushi (torched aburi sushi) was amazing. It incredible tasty, though they could've gone lighter on the mayo. The kinoko bibimbap in the stone bowl was extremely tasty too. Great balance of cheese, mushroom and rice. It is on the pricier side of things, but I would say it's worth it!"

Tables are kind of tight, but it's fine overall. I love their spinach salad and the shrimp mayo dish. They have special menu on everyday too(I think). Definitely check it out! Can't wait to revisit this place again. Their fresh squeezed juice drink was a highlight of the day! However it can get a little messy so don't wear fancy clothes if you decide to try it out."

You don't come here just to get food, but also for appetizers to share and drinks (a lot of them). I have had the pleasure of trying this place a few times. Their bibimbap is amazing, it's not a lot but it's something to fill your tummy while you drink. Another two of my favorite dishes from here are the TAKOYAKI and BEEF RIBS. They are mouth watering and I would 100% recommend you to always get them. The place gets pretty wild at night, and is always noisy (that's the whole point). Everyone is full of energy when they do sake bombs and samurai bombs. They also have a variety of other drinks that are worth trying. I never get bored of going here unless I am in need of some silence and peace (rofl)."

/user_details?userid=iF_nTUa6rS-o7MfFHD1dNg,Alice F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4 star rating,"Fun izakaya near Concordia. This is my son's favorite izakaya in Montreal (at the moment). I generally judge an izakaya by the quality of their karaage and liveliness of the crowd, and Kinka gets an A on both of those elements. Karaage was generous, juicy, well seasoned even without sauce and not greasy. The takoyaki looked good and was creamy inside, but could have been hotter: I'm used to burning my mouth on takoyaki, and this was room temperature. The miso soup was really dark, much darker than I expected, with a deep miso flavor. I'm guessing they use red miso to get that color. The short ribs were well marinated but a tad too chewy for my tastes. The salmon zushi and seared tuna were spot on. The sashimi seemed a little warm, but it was definitely fresh. As is appropriate for an izakaya, the beer was cheap and cold, and they were running a special on sake bombers. Our server was friendly, attentive and helpful. What's not to like?"
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I always enjoy coming here. Sometimes I think this portion size of the tapas menu is a little bit small, but the food is quite delicious so I guess it makes up for it.It is kind of loud though (at night) so I don't necessarily enjoy having to yell to talk to my company. Service is quick and the food is good. I find that your bill can rack up quickly when you're ordering many things to share as the tapas portion is not big. I was recently here for lunch and tried the mabo bibimbap and the neo shoyu ramen which I quite liked. My friend had the spicy miso ramen which he said was a little too salty. I don't come here that often but I always have a positive experience whenever I do come!"

Just saying, their bathrooms have MOUTHWASH and TOOTH PICKS! So go to the bathroom before you leave... lol SERVICE: The recommendations the waiters gave us were SO GOOD. That's good service - they aren't trying to make you order expensive stuff and it not be good, they are trying to give you a great dining experience with delicious food. They were also very attentive and very nice when we needed something. A lot of reviewers noted how it was loud...and honestly I felt that too. They would yell at each other any time someone put in an order or yell when someone left/came and I can see how that can be stressful. BUT, my bf who grew up in Japan and visits every few years, says that happens in Japan too, and isn't uncommon. After hearing that, it definitely made the experience more positive rather than viewing it negatively. Just sayin'.FOOD: Most of the food was mediocre (which sounds harsh but it's not AMAZING or TERRIBLE food, let me reiterate). It was delicious nonetheless for the price. They call it tapas but it was very generous portions compared to other tapas places. But what was AMAZING was their black cod + cheese oysters. Just both those dishes would make me want to go back! And I'm sure we will... NOTE: The black cod is kind of small and the most expensive of them all, but I swear you won't regret it. The fish just melts into your mouth. OVERALL: The highlight meal of our trip. 100% recommend."

I think one had a piece of octopus. The gyoza were breaded and fried?! I was just very disappointed since the reviews were so positive. Who knows, maybe it was an off night for them."

Since it's on a busy shopping street but also by a university, the vibe of this izakaya is young, loud, and energetic. They also have a terrace in the summer! My favourite dishes are the yaki udon and gyu carpaccio. I also tried the takowasabi, karaage, karubi, marugo tataki, neo shoyu ramen and kakimayo and they were also great. The food here in general is good and they have a variety of not only dishes but drinks as well! Mind you that it is quite loud inside the restaurant, and with the added sake bomb chants, I would not come here if you wanted to eat peacefully. Also, try to reserve in advance as the wait time could be a little long. For my experience, I give it 4 stars (this is because I had tried Kinka Izakaya in different locations in Toronto and preferred my experience there). I would still go back though!"

It had a great vibe to it. It's much like imadake style but more clean and modern the bathrooms are huge and set up extremely well. All individual rooms and gorgeous unique sinks for each one. The waitress was helpful and understood what I was saying for the 7 items we picked. They have a lot more options then imadake. They have pork dumplings that come in a pot with tofu and veggies very good broth. Best fried chicken not greasy perfectly cooked.

The flavors are good and the atmosphere is fun and loud. With that being said, as someone who loves big portions and lots of food, this might not be for everyone. It can get a little pricey if you want to be filled since portions are so small.When it comes to the food, I loved their sashimi and don options (rice bowls). Although the portions are small, they sure are big on flavor. Takoyaki here is good but it's pretty much the same anywhere else but a little bit more expensive here. The udon noodles were overcooked - which could be improved on. I would only come here if needed."

Everything comes out very fresh! ...fresh to the point of burning your tongue if you're too eager . My favorite out of all the orders was the gyu capaccio. I love raw food so the chewy, thin slices were mouth watering nom nom!! Second comes takoyaki! I wasn't a big fan of the karage - kind of over cooked/fried and nothing too special. Then mayo sauce went well with it though.I probably wouldn't come back unless it's pre-bar time or nearby. The gyu capaccio, service, and ambience was what kept this review a 4 star."

To think that a restaurant in North America would make dishes so delicate is amazing! At first I was a little dubious by the fact that Kinka is a chain from Toronto, however, it did not disappoint! My favorite of all dishes was the salmon tataki, it was honestly prepared to perfection! I can say it is very much like the ones I've had in Japan!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When I was asked to find a restaurant for my friend's bachelor party, I knew exactly the kind of restaurant I wanted to go to: an Izakaya. It has the perfect combination for a fun night with a large group of people: fun ambience; solid food that is easily shareable; good drink options to enjoy with the food and at a good price to boot. For this particular occasion, I decided to bring my friends to a place that I hadn't visited before in Montreal: Kinka Izakaya. The groom-to-be and myself had been to one of their Toronto restaurants and had a great time (from what I remember anyway....) so I thought it would be appropriate to bring him to the Montreal equivalent to see if the same good time would be had.Located in Faubourg St-Catherine, Kinka Izakaya is a relatively compact space with much emphasis on wood and stone. The kitchen is open to the room. There is a lot of noise as one would expect on a busy Saturday night. Service was quick and efficient. Much props to their rainbow sake bomb celebration which involves lots of yelling, singing and a big blackboard - a perfect thing for a bachelor's party ;)Foodwise, it is the usual mix for an Izakaya - noodles, soups, fried food and some sashimi options. I always go for the classic edamame bowl - nothing out of the ordinary here. Not over-boiled and properly salted. Always a good light option on the menu.The classic gyu carpaccio - seared beef sashimi served with ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips and scallions - was okay. The meat was tender enough but frankly there was a little too much ponzu at the bottom of the plate so the dish was fruity acidity.The karubi - grilled miso marinated beef short ribs - was more of a hit. The meat was nicely grilled and very tender. The marinade came through nicely and wasn't too overbearing.The Gyoza here were deep fried vegetable dumplings served with a sweet chili mayo. Very flavourful filling and a nice crunch to the exterior. I enjoyed the nice sweet heat that came through in the mayo as well.One of my personal favorites at an Izakaya is takoyaki - deep fried octopus balls served with tonkatsu sauce and mayo. Kinka does this well - the filling was very flavourful. The natural flavour of octopus comes through nicely and I always love the mixture of the tonkatsu sauce and the mayo.The karaage - deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken served with garlic mayo - was a little oily but had great crunch and the chicken itself was moist and flavourful - not too salty despite the soy sauce marinade. The garlic mayo had a nice kick to it as well and paired well with the chicken.One of our group really wanted to order the tontoro so we tried it. A skewer of grilled pork cheek served with yuzu pepper - I enjoyed the tenderness of pork cheeks but frankly this is the one dish that lack strong flavour.The final dish I tried was ikapiri - deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup and wasabi mayo. Nice taste to the calamari themselves but lacked the crunch you want from fried calamari. The spicy kitchen and wasabi mayo was a very strong combination of sweet, spice and richness. Really loved this dish despite then lack of crunch.We had fun, eat and drank well - so overall Kinka Izakaya was exactly what I hoped it would be. Izayakas are always a fun time and it's great to see many good ones opening up around Montreal. So arrive with an empty stomach, open mind and be ready to shout 'Sake Bomb' - you won't be disappointed.Cheers!"

Arriving at 6pm because our first choice had a line out the door, we were seated promptly upon arrival. Tables were full with several birthday parties, but we were seated at the bar, which was nice since it was much easier to hear each other over the yelling (from many, many sake bombs) and loud music. Started the evening with drinks. The beer mojito peaked my interest most and I thought it was okay. They may have muddled the mint a little too much since it gave a bitter aftertaste, but otherwise, a nice little concoction there. My friend got the Nama Grapefruit Sour. It's intriguing that you get to juice your own grapefruit, but at least you know it's fresh juice and you're free to moderate how much juice to add. For food, we got a few things to share: Zuke Maguro (special menu item), Unagi Bibimbap, Tebasaki, Salmon Tataki and Hojicha Pudding. Most of the dishes were on the sweeter side, but most likely modified to match the Canadian palate. Patrons of this establishment were mixed, but definitely the party type. Music was bumping, many birthdays were celebrated and they do sake bombs in buckets. Yeah...buckets! Lot of yelling, words of encouragement and cheering was involved, but quite a lively atmosphere.As we finished up, Kinka drew quite the crowd with a full house inside and on the patio deck. I suggest making a reservation if you can and if you want to party it up, the sake bombs are such a show!"

The restaurant is quite clean and the atmosphere is very lively!FOOD: Quality was very good. The plates are more on the fancier side and are nicely presented, although the portions are small (but what do you expect from a tapas bar). I wasn't the BIGGEST fan of their udon, I found it too soft and like it had been sitting in water for too long. But their karaage, takoyaki and sashimi were delicious. I also liked their unagi bibimbap. PRICE: Price is a little more on the expensive side since tapas dishes are smaller. For example, I paid 9$ for a dish of sashimi (about 5 pieces). Taste and quality were good but portions are small.SERVICE: Super friendly.

Don't worry, the service is really fast.The only dish I could not stomach was the takowasabi. It's a small bowl of slimy octopus bits in a marinade of wasabi. I love wasabi. (I also love horseradish, but that not the same thing) But, in this case, it tasted like cleaning products. Maybe if you are a true diehard fan of wasabi it can be your thing. But to me, no more.But the rest was amazing! Of this round, my 3 stars goes to: In third place: The warm ozeki sake suggested by my server. Second place: The carpaccio of octopus and on first: The maguro dango soup, which is a dashi soup with tuna fish cake.Go with friend, order all the places and don't forget the sake bomb!"

The dishes are mostly tapas with a variety of Japanese and Korean cuisines, both in hot (ramen, bibimbap, -don and fried foods) and cold (sashimi, sushi). They have a nice seasonal menu as well. My favourite were the scallop and salmon sashimi (seasonal) and the saba and salmon oshizushi. Their drinks menu is also varied and interesting, with mostly Japanese oriented flavours; matcha, Yuzu, litchi, sake, etc. Not very strong but pretty tasty.

We ordered the spicy miso ramen, takoyaki and the mabo men set with rice and soup. The ramen wasn't actually spicy but was still quite flavourful, although I wish the boiled egg that came with it was a little more runny and not fully cooked. The mabo men was delicious as well, not being too spicy and perfect for those who want noodles without having soup.Altogether, the food was good and the prices are fair especially for their lunch sets. The only cons would be the wait time to order and get our food. Would recommend, and suggest to reserve if you're going for supper!"

With so many items on the menu it was hard to decide on a few things and some items are bound to be underwhelming. The key is knowing just exactly what to get. Stick to the tried and true items. The highlight was the salmon tataki, and it seems the raw items are the safest picks here. But otherwise most items were fairly disappointing or just mediocre. I wouldn't exactly recommend the ebi mayo, or okonomiyaki (it's not exactly a pancake). The pressed sushi was okay but the rice was more mushy and vinegary than I expected, and the salmon just did not come through at all. The tofu salad was a big portion which was surprising, it was nice to have some greens for your meal. I did enjoy their own branded 'kinka' sake which was pretty good. It's a bitit of a shame we couldn't take the bottle home. Service was friendly and good here with no problems."

We ordered takoyaki and wagyu sushi for appetizers, which were both delicious. The server recommended the sushi, which is apparently pretty popular right now. Both the unagi bibimbap and shoyu ramen were great, though unagi is my favourite so I may be a bit biased. Lastly, we got the black sesame ice cream to end. What a perfect dinner!

If I had to pay individually for each item, I don't think it'll be worth it.The environment is the bomb! Sake bomb.

I came across this restaurant from a recent yelper's review and the pictures caught my attention. Street parking only. The restaurant isn't that large, but it's not tiny either. Open kitchen concept w/ great ventilation bc we didn't leave stinky. Loud and energetic atmosphere. Be warned that this place is very loud and it gets louder when there's a birthday in the house. Staff and service are both friendly and fast (except for our server).  There are 4 clean separate restrooms stocked with toothpicks and mouthwash. Very busy on a Saturday night. The wait wasn't too long (10 mins) because we called ahead to be put on a waiting list.  Hubby ordered a Sapporo mojito. He enjoyed his drink and commented on how nice and refreshing it was. For appetizers we ordered:Tako Kalu - octopus carpaccio w/ spicy garlic dressing. This was on their special menu of the day. I wasn't impressed. The octopus was tender, but the flavors were a little too oniony. The sauce that was served with the octopus was a sweet and garlicky sriracha based sauce. Not my favorite. Tako wasabi - this was a tiny little dish, but packed a huge punch. I'm typically not a fan of wasabi, but this dish was well seasoned. The sauce element had a slimy texture which was odd, but not off pudding. The salt level was a tad heavy, but not inedible. This was served w toasted seaweed. Yum.Kaki Mayo - OMG the BEST baked oysters I've ever tasted. Flavors were on point and everything just worked so well together. Perfect blend of cream, salt, spinach, and broiled cheese. WOW. The oysters were ginormous, too. YOU MUST ORDER THIS DISH!!For dinner we ordered:Neo Shoyu Ramen - this was on their special menu of the day. OMG one of the best ramens I've ever had. The pork, noodles, bamboo shoots, broth, and seaweed were all perfectly seasoned and worked harmoniously together. The pork was meaty with a tiny strip of fat, but slightly chewy. Broth was out of this world delicious. Nice portion for a $10 bowl. SO HAPPY! Unagi Bibimbap - this dish was delicious. The stone pot was so hot that it kind of burnt the rice a tad. The unagi was silky and delightful. A little under seasoned, but paired perfectly with the rapini stir fry dish (nano Hana). Nano Hana - stir fried rapini w 3 types of mushrooms in a soy and garlic sauce. This is not the rapini I am used to aka broccoli rabe. It's actually pea vines that were used which is fine bc this dish was THE BOMB DOT COM. Yep I said it. So good! The flavors were amazingly well balanced and the mushrooms and greens were cooked just right. A plate of umami greatness if you ask me.Overall, this restaurant impressed us and it's definitely not your typical Japanese sushi restaurant (not the ones we're used to). Tons of cool and unique dishes to choose from and loads of flavor bombs. The one thing that sucked was our server. He took our drink order and the octopus apps then disappeared for the rest of the night. Luckily all of the servers work together and run all of the food out to all the tables and take orders from other tables. The rest of the crew took good care of us and placed the rest of our dinner orders. Very friendly and smiley. We will definitely come back!TIP: make a reservation ahead of time or call the restaurant before you arrive to be placed on their waiting list."

JJ and I started our dinner off with a sake bomb each--I continued with a liter of Sapporo (a 'grande verre'), while he had another bomb. We also ordered sashimi salads, which were light but packed with protein from the fish. I ate my fill of the edamame, which was very salty (but not inedible), and we also had fried chicken, which was happily all dark meat.I really liked the boisterous and busy atmosphere, and the food was the perfect start to our evening."

We went there around noon and ordered some food on the regular menu. The salmon oshizushi which is a special sushi. It served with salmon on top of the rice. I like the salmon but not the rice. The rice was not made fresh, I think they pre-made it and left it in fridge for the night. We asked the waitress about it and she didn't give us any answers, even after we asked for the check, I would only assume that she chose to forget about it.I gave them one star is because there isn't an option for zero star."

For the first time, I have used yelp reservation online, it was quick, easy and super cool - few clicks and the place was reserved! The atmosphere inside is fun and friendly, it is a bit more noisy than your average restaurant/bar, you hear sake bomb shout outs quite often. The tasting menu is great, you get to try different dishes which include meat, fish and greens too. If you add a big 1 liter mug of Sapporo beer to that meal and you're all set for a perfect evening with friends or colleagues."
/user_details?userid=OifBjwK9CQa04-6b9Czr8A,Mika T.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"I really liked the atmosphere at Kinka Izakaya. All the waiters and cooks were so friendly, and they would greet everyone that came in and out of the restaurant. The ambiance may be a little loud for some people, but it's a perfect place to grab a few drinks and just hangout! We made reservations ahead of time on a Friday night for 10:00 PM, but unfortunately, we didn't get seated until ~25 mins later. This was probably because it was still very packed throughout the evening.   Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, but if you're going there for dinner, it's so easy for your tab to rack up because you won't get full from just ordering a couple of dishes. I would recommend this place only if you're going for a small dinner/snack or drinks.  Food we ordered:- Lobster Sashimi ~ $16 (very delicious but portion was smaller than what I anticipated)- Seared Albacore Tuna Sashimi ~$8.80 (delicious)- Grilled Oysters ~$8.80 (the oysters were really large!)- Takoyaki ~ $5.80 (delicious) - Stingray Fin ~ $4.80 (portion was smaller than what I anticipated)- Matcha Cheesecake ~$6.30 (I would definitely recommend this cheesecake!)- Sakura Drink ~$7.50 (a nice peachy drink) Overall: This is a great place for drinks if you don't mind the loud but friendly and fun ambiance. Food was delicious, and all the staff were so friendly. I'd also recommend the matcha cheesecake - not too sweet or heavy."

This trendy spot is located in the faubourg and definitely brings life to the area. I I recommend the sharing menu which permits everyone to sample many of their wonderful dishes. The service is great and friendly. The whole experience is not complete without ordering  their sake bomb drink which is super cool. Once this drink is brought to your table the waiter and your table will begin to chant sake bomb which creates a super fun ambiance!

It's a loud, fun, noisy, bistro Japanese-style but could you please lower your screaming?They scream out the orders across the entire restaurant each time something new comes in, or a new person coming in or going out, and this is far, FAR louder than what they used to do. It was cute and cool in the first days they opened (although they never screamed orders, only when people entered or left) but now they are just LOUD. Maybe I'm just old.I'm not bothered by it per se but it got kind of annoying after an hour and a half when you're trying to have a nice meal with your friends and/or family.I love the karaage (fried chicken), black code, scallops, unagi don and that's all I pretty much come here for."

Went there after work with a friend for a few pints of Sapporo and quick bites.We ordered a pitcher of beer, the Tuna Tataki on the special menu, the (justifiably) famous Fried calamari, the Udon with Roe and Kimchi and the Unagi bibimbap. The Tataki was fresh, smokey, it was topped with smoked shishito pepper, and a mayo-based sauce. It was good but they could have dropped the mayo. The Unagi Bibimbap was definitely a Japanese interpretation of the Korean classic, With a strong seaweed and Unagi presence. It was deliciously succulent; however, the rice could have been a tad dryer. The calamari is one of Guu's most famous dish, and it is understandable why. It's amazing, sweet, crispy, spicy, creamy will be the best way to describe the bite. The Udon was also good, chewy, with the taste contrast between the kimchi and the fish roe in coating the noodles. Scored 40$ with drinks and a (generous) tip. Service was great tho."

The only thing I liked was the black sesame sauce they put on the vegetable, but again, I couldn't believe how small was the dish. Their karaage was by far the worst I've ever had in an izakaya, no flavour at all... I would go to this place if all the other izakaya are fully booked, otherwise I wouldn't go again."

To share, we ordered the baked oysters, yaki udon, Nanohana, salmon tartare and one other dish from the daily special I forgot the name. Basically the food was magical! It did things to my taste buds I probably should not repeat on a public review. The service was great as well. I'd probably say my ultimate favourite, though very difficult to pick one, were the baked oysters. But everything was delicious! I thought it was decently priced. And I definitely recommend sharing. To top it off, my cousin and I had sake bombs and that was such a fun, loud experience. Try it out! Next trip to Montréal I will be returning."

Now just like all other common izakaya , nothing really special and their sushi taste ....... eennnnh not my style . Sorry that I always compare restaurant with different area such as MIku , but the least that I heard Kinka is a restaurant under Guu ( Toronto izakaya) I assume supposedly it will have a better quality but I doubt。 I tasted MIku Vancouver which is a way better than this . Maybe the average of the izakaya in Montreal is just low . Sorry, if I would go for izakaya , this one will just be one of the whatever option that I randomly picked"
/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"There are a lot of problems with Kinka Izakaya. It's really, really loud. This is a taste thing, sure, but be aware. The staff is more concerned with watching the door so they know when to start yelling than they are with serving you (the entire staff yells together every time anyone enters or leaves... and everytime someone orders something... and intermittently between that). We probably waited 20 minutes without anyone serving us (not even drinks) before we waved a server over, and the restaurant was less than half full. All the servers seemed to be serving all of the tables at once, and we had to repeatedly stop different wait staff from clearing dishes we were still eating from. Then there's the food... which was not good. The best thing we had was the black cod, which was nicely cooked even if the skin remained a little soggy. The tasting menu comes also with: salmon tataki, which seemed overly sweet and not the best fish quality, fried chicken, which was fine but could have been bought at any fast food place frankly, marinated beef ribs, which had tasty fat but had been overcooked, and a marinated rapini in a black sesame sauce which was actually ok. The worst two dishes we had were the bibimbap, which was dull and gray and like eating a bowl of mud, and the ""tofu salad"" which is a limp lettuce salad doused in soy sauce featuring six 1cmx1cm cubes of unflavored raw soft tofu. We left these mostly untouched.The meal finished with an ice cream of your choice, but we were pretty ready to leave before that point had come.So, if you're in a large group and you want to get yelled at all night and obliterated on sake, this place is probably the right place, but it's not a place to eat."

However the music was really loud and gave me a headache, which went away after I had their delicious sake/lime/mint/calpico cocktail thingy. Honestly a high-end feeling restaurant in regards to food, service, and bathroom quality (yeah they have a really nice bathroom check it out). The price is very reasonable as well, honestly a steal considering the quality of the food I had, but I can't say that for other food items. There are just a lot overpriced places with mediocre food in Montreal, but I finally got lucky with this one.  I had the torched salmon pressed sushi which just melt in my mouth as well as the wagyu beef sushi which was really good as well. Would highly recommend those two. I just really wish the music would be some relaxing music instead of hardcore pop and rap; really ruins the relaxing and comforting ambiance Japanese restaurants usually carry, which reflects the tone of their cuisine. There was this unpleasant chlorine smell too, but that might have just been me. That being said, I'd definitely go back again."
/user_details?userid=iZNMT00J-0dk9vqNJnopcQ,Mijin N.,"Denver, CO",1 star rating,Far from authentic Japanese. It is fusion Japanese mixed with Korean style.

/user_details?userid=bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,Viva V.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Love this place.  Super friendly staff and pretty solid food.  My favs are the kamimayo (baked oysters with spinach, cheese and mushrooms) and unagi bimbimbop.  Both are definitely great dishes.  The daily specials can be hit or miss.  One time we had the salmon belly sashimi and it's great.  One time we had the tuna sushi ball and it wasn't anything special and way too much rice.  Sashimi salad is pretty good with a variety of fish and fancy seaweeds.  Kimchi-nabe was good with dumplings, kimchi, tofu and pork, although some of the pork slices were still very ""stuck together"", like they were frozen before and didn't get separated before throwing in to the pot.  But it's a pretty good dish for a cold day and not overly spicy.  The biggest disappointment was the black miso cod. Usually a fan of this dish at any Japanese restaurants and don't know how they could screw this one up.  I think it's the quality of the fish... not fresh or super frozen previously.. the texture of the fish was very strange and definitely made it to the worst black miso cod I've ever had list.  And the miso sauce was a little bit much on the top too.  My least favor dish for sure at this place.  Love the menu, looks overwhelming but very easy to navigate with all languages displayed together.  The chefs and staff like to shout constantly... like some of the Japanese joints where they shout when customers come in and out.  They were shouting a bit too much and seemed like they were shouting when every single dish was made... funny and entertaining.  Definitely not a place if you're looking for a quiet or romantic meal.  But not annoying, just shouting too much for my taste.  good music though.  definitely would come back!"

Don't miss the vegetable gioza made with onions and mushrooms. Great gomae with rapini! The mocchicino in sweet soya sauce was everything you expect of it: chewy and sweet at the same time.The vegetarian bibimbap was good but my least favourite.

The staff were very enthusiastic and friendly, but the food was average.We ordered a total of four dishes: the beef carpaccio, an octopus daily special, bibimbap, and the Saba.The beef carpaccio wasn't exciting. There was rice vinegar, the beef itself...honestly it was boring. The taste was not outstanding and adding onion to the dish may have highlighted the beef for me, but there was no onion.The tako/octopus was cut too thick and the sauce that accompanied the dish didn't taste like it belonged. It was too spicy for the octopus. The octopus was tasteless and the sauce was too much.Bibimbap was too salty and by the time we finished our first bite of the bibambap the rest of the rice was burnt. We did not mix the bowl ourselves but a staff member helped us, which I appreciated, but it was clear that it was not mixed well.The Saba was even more over seasoned than the rice. The sauce was extremely salty despite having a perfectly cooked piece of fish sitting on top. Overall, the food was very average.

It looks like it would be a fun izakaya place at night. We each ordered the ramen set. The ramen set consisted of ramen (I believe it was shio ramen) and a side of vegetable tempura over rice with a teriyaki sauce. There was so much food and all of it was delicious!  The ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth was perfect. I have been to many ramen places where the broth was way too salty and Kinka is not one of those places. The vegetables were deep fried in a little bit of batter and drizzled with a teriyaki sauce. Mixing the teriyaki sauce with the rice and eating it with the deep fried vegetables was heaven.  The next time I am in Montreal I will be sure to stop in at night to experience the izakaya experience Kinka has to offer."

The waiter asked us to change our orders several times. They are out of fired vegetables so they offered salad instead(which is just a few vegetables leaves with soy sauce), or fries. And then they say they are out of fries! So they offered rice and fried vegetables instead??? What do the restaurants take us for? Idiots?? This is without a doubt the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to!"

Everything was delicious and portions were larger than what I expected for an izakaya place. Loved the atmosphere of this place!"

Boy is this place LOUD. I don't know if it was just like everybody's birthday that night or what but this is one of the loudest places I've ever been. Everybody was yelling, and the staff had drums and huge chalkboards proclaiming birthdays, the table text to us did an organized chant-yell about sake bombs, like this was a very loud place that I assume nobody over 40 goes to. Though considering how packed and loud it was, there was no wait for a table which made everything seem a lot more manageable. We ordered the Kakuni (braised pork belly with mashed potato & boiled egg), Karubi (grilled miso marinated beef short ribs--probably the stand out dish), Ikapiri (deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup & wasabi mayo), and Veg Furai (yam fries and green bean tempura with honey mayo & matcha salt). Everything came out looking absolutely beautiful- I don't typically care about how my food looks when it's served, but I was genuinely impressed with their spread AND, more importantly, their portion sizes. Those four dishes were perfectly filling to share, plus we got some black sesame ice cream to wash it all down. A+, great first meal in Montreal and makes me a little sad I don't live closer. There were definitely some intense looking alcoholic drinks I'd be down to go back and try."

They had ""sake bomb"" chant-like things that they yelled with the customers who wanted to try and gulp it down. The overall atmosphere was so upbeat and alive. The food was also all so good, so good that I didn't realize how much we had until the bill came out (hence the 4 star). It was pricier than I expected and had eaten (small portions for its price). Regardless, you HAVE to try the baked oysters and the cheesecake. The matcha cheesecake is All. That. -SO good. SO GOOD!!"
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally a really fabulous eatery in Shaughnessy Village/Concordia Ghetto area!I came here yesterday shortly after they opened, so there was no line-up or anything of the sort and was promptly seated at the bar, which was great because I could watch them preparing dishes and watch the dishes I didn't order fly by so I have a better idea for next time.  And there definitely will be a next time.First off, the decor is simple, spartan but very elegant. Tables are pine wood and the walls look like they've been woven.  The servers I had were super friendly and it was fun watching then yell out the orders in Japanese.They serve cocktails here which I did not try but instead went straight for the plum wine. I usually try out old stand-bys first and  see how good they are before I try out more unique and original dishes. And I must say, the food here was stellar. I had the Nanohana, garlic stir-fried rapini with enoki and shiitake mushrooms,  along with the Karaage, soy sauce marinated fried chicken and Takoyaki, the octopus dumplings. If greens were this tasty everywhere all the time, trust me, moms everywhere would never have anything to ever worry about again. As for the fried chicken, I think at some point there will need to be a ""Best Fried Chicken in Montreal"" list because this could be a contender.  The Takoyaki were also perfect. Firm on the outside, soft on the inside and the octopus was not overcooked at all.Also, I have to say the bathrooms here are very, very clean and probably has one of the coolest tap and sinks I've seen in a while, more reminiscent of a country pump and wooden tub. I have never before seen bathrooms that also carry and offer free feminine hygiene products. Very thoughtful and forward thinking."

It is always fun hearing the staff yell out ""Sake Bombs"" whenever a customer orders one, really brightens up the place. Great place to come too if you are looking for a fun time, I guarantee you. Great music too! Food: 3.5/5 I tried their first taster menu, wonderful, every single dish went well together, and order was superb. However, their fish could be improved or replaced, I wasn't a big fan. However their 2nd dish on their taster menu, the bean salad was amazing! In addition, I really enjoyed their black sesame ice cream. It actually made me seek out black sesame ice cream the next day at the store. Price: 3.5/5 If you are going with a group and going to be drinking for a while, expect to pay a bit. It isn't that cheap of a place. Overall, would come again with a group of friends for the vibes, the sake bombs, and food. That will foster good memories."
/user_details?userid=c8Ymo6xaxz3JI3u6oTVerw,Thomas T.,"Golden Square Mile, Canada",5 star rating,"A little bit of Tokyo in Montreal .Brought by the Kinka family .Okay how am I supposed to review this ..For once that I truly felt in love with such a restaurant in Montreal. A lot of people who know me knows that I'm a sucker for Japanese food --having had amazing experiences at Guu in Toronto and Vancouver. Although , the food is not 100% authentic , let's just say they nailed it in term of concept and food quality.My experience here was  memorable as I got the opportunity to visit this place during their pre-opening week. One of the first thing to note here is that their staff are new and I think it's going to take a hit of time for them to get down to their desired customer service and experience , I'm going to be fair and I'm going to say it was okay. Staff seems eager to get rid of your plates sometimes --without asking and eye contacts is not omnipresent. I guess those are things that they can work on.But so far , I did see the manager on the floor , telling them how to become more efficient and how to give the best experience to customers. A+ to that man , he managed Toronto's Guu in the last and he will be in no time manage to get this restaurant to it's full capacity in no time.Food experience was excellent.The Okonomiyaki was above average as compared to other places I've tried in Montreal. The pancake was just enough crispy to make me enjoy the squids! They didn't go overboard with their sauce either.The gyu tataki salad was the most memorable plate for me. this plate was not only refreshing but the beef sashimi actually tasted amazing. One has to try to explain the feelings I had while slowly biting and savouring my experience with this dish. Indeed, if you come here , I highly recommend trying this.The last dish I had taken was the Kimchi udon--I'll be honest , it wasn't great. I think it was a little bit overpriced and lacked some flavours. At that price , you could also expect a bigger portion when it's concern noodles and kimchi but it wasn't the case. Overall, I'll give this place 5 stars , from the moment I walked in and to the moment I walked out , I had a great izakaya experience. Although , it's not the perfect spot to drink just yet based on the crowd--I think it will only slowly become based on the service , food and my high expectations from Kinka family.Food wise it can definitely improve , and I hope it will as they can bring so many plates from their franchise. And to have a happy time , note that bottle of sake are not expensive, a group will easily have a blast with booze if they want.Do I plan to come back here in the future ? Definitely , and then I will re-review my experience to see whether they have match ,exceed or failed to respond to my expectations."

I've been to Guu and various Izakayas in Toronto, so seeing it in montreal brings back nice memories. I got the Sakura cocktail, and it was decent. Very sweet though - which I like. Our dishes included Takoyaki, assorted sashimi salad, tuna tartar, fried chicken + mayo, tuna steak, wasabi octopus, pumpkin puree with red bean ice cream and mochi, green tea creme brulee. My favourite was the pumpkin puree dessert and takoyaki. My friends were the tuna tartar and assorted sashimi salad. In terms of consistency, the wasabi octopus was very on par. However, I was susprised with a few of our other dishes like the tuna steak. The tuna steak was definitely cooked too much on the outside. From what my friend had said, it was not like the one he tried earlier in the week when he came to eat. The other dishes were fine though. Portion sizes are always a little smaller than usual restaurants, but this is because its more of a snack restaurant. Nonetheless, I went home quite full! The place definitely offers fresh food in comparison to other japanese restaurants in montreal. But not as fresh as what I had expected. Perhaps this justifies a second visit in the near future for me. I definitely recommend a visit though. Service was pretty good, our waittress came by regularly and was courteous. The decor is done very nicely ; I always like taking a visit to the washrooms. It offers use of mouthwash. Overall, we left with a loud farewell from the staff and a wave good bye to end the night."

(Awkward at first, but it was alright when the food arrived)So many dishes to try !!! Luckily i did some research before, so i knew a bit of what I wanted to order.The food came really fast. Beautiful, Flavourful, exciting!My favourite one was the EBIMAYO. I go crazy for Fried Shrimp and those shrimps were super big haha.Takoyaki, Crazy quality. #SpeechlessFor the dessert, the Matcha creme brulee = Must-try (OBLIGER) lolFor the service, it was really good. Our Metal cup (yes) were always full and I liked how they ask us If we enjoy the experience. I was happy that another table celebrate their birthday.Half of the staff went near the table and start singing in Japanese and Happy birthday in English. They even brought a blackboard with HBD on it. Even if it wasn't my friend bday, we could feel the excitement through us haha. When we left the place, they all screamed in japanese and waved at us.

/user_details?userid=dPw3YdhvbdY7wVL6N_Y6yw,Carmel B.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",2 star rating,"Pros- The food was delicious- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch- Great decorCons- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.OverallMaybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting."

Servers and chefs alike shout greetings and farewells, and announce each serving from the counter, and - perhaps most uniquely - holler the ""sake bomb"" chants. The food is fresh and delicious, ranging from sashimis to karaages to ramens/udons /rice etc. Each order in small portions such that a couple can easily order 7-10 dishes in one dinner. The two cocktails we tried - Yuzu and Sake Sour - went very well with the dinner. If anyone is feeling down and wants to be reenergized in a cheerful, booming atmosphere, go to Kinka!"

The staff was nice enough but they yelled at the top of their lungs--constantly. They yell when you walk in, they yell your order to the cooks, the cooks yell back, they yell when they're standing next to you. It was non-stop. Five minutes after I placed my order, I couldn't wait to get out of there. To be fair, izakaya restaurants in Japan often call out their orders, but the yelling I experienced here was over the top and hurt my ears.  As for the food, it was prepared carefully and seemed mostly authentic. The only problem was that everything tasted sweet (seafood salad, agedashi tofu, gindara). I don't understand why any chef would want to hide the flavors of good ingredients that way.They are obviously trying hard and it wouldn't take much to be the best in the area. All they need to do is tone down the ridiculous yelling and stop trying to improve (localize) original Japanese recipes. It wouldn't hurt to add shochu to the drink menu, too."

/user_details?userid=qe_Yiq-Gm60TA9cK0VfbiA,Nina N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Much hyped restaurant opening in Montreal: just like Vancouver and Toronto, Montreal was going to have its own isakaya (Japanese pub) belonging to the Guu franchise! Although I really appreciated the other Guu locations, Kinka didn't resonate as well with me. For starters, the drink selection is more limited, and it doesn't even serve Asahi Black. The fact that only the Sapporo can be ordered as a pitcher makes me question the credibility of this place as a bar/pub--the sake and cocktail selection is plentiful, but beer is definitely the staple of any bar in my opinion.As expected, the menu is filled with tasty Japanese tapas, ranging from fried foods to fresh sashimi. I always have the same order whenever I go to a Guu location: karaage (fried chicken), takoyaki (fried octopus balls), okonomiyaki (panfried seafood pancake) and chirashi bowl/plate (sashimi over greens or rice). All ordered items were cooked true to fashion, except that the okonomiyaki was disappointing (overcooked on the outside, but soggy on the inside), just like the sashimi salad--some of the fish tasted like it was defrozen. However, prices are cheap (around $7 a plate, and you can be full on two small plates), and there are combos (ramen+tapas+drink) that allow you to have a good meal without breaking the bank.The atmosphere is typical of any Guu location: noisy, rowdy but welcoming, since the staff greets (or yells greetings) every time a new guest walks into the restaurant. The decor is dark but sophisticated, very reminiscent of industrial design because of the use of metallic colors for the ceiling and the walls. Perfect for groups and casual hangouts."

I'm pretty sure they're saying something like ""thank you for coming"" though so at least it's not obscene profanities. The food was great! As for sushi and sashimi, I think there are only two options which kinda sucks but the rest of the menu is great. They have hot plates and cold plates to share with your party and I've never had anything I hated. Some of the slices of meat are a little hard to chew but it's not something I can't work around.

The ramen itself was very lackluster! He even said it tasted like 99c instant noodles.We also had the honey bbq pork which wasn't even BBQ, just slabs of leathery meat...We had the fried chicken with mayo-- the best thing all night.And the beef ribs, which were alright.For drinks I had the Sake Mojito: it tasted awesome but I'm skeptical about the amount of alcohol that was actually in it.My main issue with this place is that the food was expensive and not worth it AT ALL."

Food were good, have been back here for around 4-5 times, each time tried different menu and all good. The best one probably is the karaage and salmon tartare (?). Saw tons of people ordered the sake bomb, it looked fun."

For those of you who are looking for a quiet night eating delicious Japanese food, this place is not for you. I typically go for dinner around 6 pm or after 9 pm and generally don't have to wait. I went last weekend around 7 pm and ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table. Every time that I visit, I order the saba. It is amazing and possibly the best that I have ever eaten. The fish is placed on a bed of onions, sliced lemons and herbs, the bones are removed, and it is cooked to perfection. The only downside is that it takes about 20 minutes to cook. Well worth the wait though. Overall, the selection is more authentic than a lot of the Japanese restaurants in town, and the fact that they are small plates allows you to try a lot of new dishes or share with the table. The staff is very friendly, and the prices are reasonable. Will go back again."

The appetizers however were lacking.  Only 1 out 5 was amazing which was the salmon sashimi,  specialty of the day. The chicken wings were nice and crispy. But thats pretty much it. Overall too pricey for what you get. Spent $70 for 5 tiny tapas and two drinks. And we were still hungry unfortunately. But I have to mention the service was outstanding.

I had the Miso Ramen (Vegetarian) and my dad had the Shoyu ramen. The service and atmosphere were unfortunately both not on par with the food. There were multiple tables open but they forced us to sit at the bar next to a very loud group of people. In fact, the entire restaurant is extremely noisy. Loud music and very loud staff, who are constantly yelling at one another or sometimes into thin air. Their birthday celebration song, which was performed more than once, is also at piercing volumes. They brought us one large mug of beer to share, which was odd. They offered to go back and split it for us. My fathers ramen came out and after 10 minutes, I inquired where mine was. They responded there was a mistake and it would be ready in 10 minutes. Instead of offering a solution, the waitress stood there, awaiting instruction. As I said, good food. Everything else in the restaurant was rather disappointing."

It is too loud here, really I have to scream at my friend to be heard, and they really should do away with the annoying greetings. The place looks very clean, and the service is consistent, I go pretty often because it's not so busy anymore so it's easy to get a table. Imadake is too busy, so is Kazu.

We shared all the vegetarian plates on the menu - food was tasty but didn't have the wow factor. The place was sometimes too loud at moments, but festive at the same time.

The ramen tasted like most shoyu ramens, but it had green onions that were grilled/sautéed which gave it a smoky-ish taste which was a nice addition. The salmon also had a smoky/sweet taste to it. The salad was fresh and the sashimi in it was not too bad. Service is great and food came out quickly. They also take credit card."

The salmon sushi, octopus balls, beef shanghai noodles and dumpling soup were all tasty in their own way. We also got the grapefruit cocktail to start and our lovely waitress freshly squeezed it in front of us.I would definitely recommend Kinka Izakaya for the food, atmosphere and the service!"

/user_details?userid=Bo90ToiOB-qqTAXMqeEgjA,Vince T.,"Pickering, Canada",5 star rating,"If you have been to Guu in Toronto then you know what to expect at Kinka. The menu is Tapas style with a Japanese twist. You are greeted with the warm loud yell when entering the restaurant, the atmosphere is festive and inviting with nice blend of house and electronic in the background. The staff and service is excellent. Food on the menu is excellent regardless of what you order. Fresh, Creative and full of flavor. Make sure you order a big mug of Sapporo beer and try the Sake Mojito!!! The one great plus that Kinka has is the outdoor patio during the summer. I love how the patio is placed by the road and next to the couple of other restaurants with their patios also. It just make a great dining experience with friends before heading out on the town. Price of the food is not cheap but you pay for what you get and that is Quality. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner then do look elsewhere but if you are looking for a festive outing with friends then Kinka is a highly recommended place to go."

I like the concept but I feel that management didn't execute the idea properly. Like the bar has the look and all but when I go inside the place, they got really loud modern music and I'm thinking to myself, should'nt there be more traditional Japanese music inside a place like this to add to the theme.I also wish there was more Japanese beer selections, they only got 3 kinds of Japanese beers and I was hoping for more. I like the idea of these kinds of bars but I also want to feel relaxed in them which I can't.Anyways, I probably won't go here again unless forced to by friends and they're paying."

It tasted to me like a shirley temple, but with an extra twist! Service was attentive and friendly. They yell at you, in a good way, when you arrive AND when you leave. How special! You definitely feel the love. I am really excited and happy about this new izakaya located in downtown. I really recommend coming here for drinks/tapas if you are in the guy area.

It wasn't busy when we came in, but they somehow were able to bring out our dishes horrendously slow and out-of-order until the restaurant was starting to fill up. By that time, maybe half of our table got their entrees, and when the other half got their food, the others had finished ages ago.

/user_details?userid=N-9TUqQXGIjE7qjuuX9ysA,Jamie W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Definitely worth the hype. I am on a roll with izakayas recently and this place does remind me of Guu.We showed up on a Sunday at 5 pm (the opening) and although being the first in line, the place filled up in no time after we sat down. Decor-wise you will find some small tables but more buffet-type larger tables for share. We were seated at the bar for a party of three and I got to peak at the food preparation and plating. As expected, the loud cheer upon arrival and departure is also part of the experience.Food-wise, a great izakaya. Seasoning of the dishes are on the stronger end. I can imagine those who like bolder flavours to love the food here. Ingredients were definitely fresh which would be expected with the amount of turnover at this place. One dish that was more memorable for me was the mackerel. It's not typically a fish I like but this was cooked tender, with a good balance of flavour and right amount of char on the skin. The other dishes we had were more the everyday variety (udon, Japanese pancake, tuna tartare, etc) and nothing was a let down. I feel like on a lazy day I can just close my eyes and chose anything and be guaranteed a good meal. Portions are quite large for an izakaya, you can guaranteed to be full if you have a carb-heavy choice per person (with other apps to share of course).All in all, I can't wait to come back again.Last point - the girl's bathroom is quite a sight. Not sure if this is the custom in Japan but the bathroom was equipped from mouth wash, lotion down to sanitary napkins. I definitely don't see that everyday."

The menu is the same as its Vancouver and Toronto counterparts, and is equally delicious. Highlights for me were the  baked oysters, seafood udon, spicy calamari, octopus balls, cod, the bibimbap, the fried chicken... you see where I'm going with this, right? Order basically anything off the menu, and you'll leave satisfied. Oh, and don't forget to wash it down with a plum wine mojito! Final note: if you're with a party of four or more, expect to wait. We were in on a Tuesday and waited for a table for over an hour. Not sure if they take reservations, but definitely worth trying."

If you have been to places like Guu it is very similar. Our group of friends were looking for a place to get some Sake bombs.

I recommend just going there with some friends and trying the tasting menu. Trust me it's really filling.

/user_details?userid=8ykvRUfsxhdMd3IVJQMb3w,Josh G.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was great but the service was really really poor. It took 45 mins for any drinks to arrive at the table. The server brought food out in no particular order, one person had finished all 4 plates before another person at our table had his first dish. The server did not return to our table after dropping our initial round of plates off. They did not clear the unused plates off the table. At checkout they did not know who ordered what dish, and it took us a lengthy process of returning to the register before they could get it right. On top of that, they added an %18 gratuity to our orders which is only supposed to be done for a party of 7 or greater. Very disappointed!"

/user_details?userid=JE6ZqyqHRwTfhuDdhhS3bA,Ada G.,"Hamilton, Canada",4 star rating,"Mmmm came here on Saturday night with an old friend and absolutely loved it! I've always loved izakaya style meals, and having small plates makes it so much easier to share and try different things. We came here on Saturday night around 7, and the wait list took about 30-45min without a reservation. The next time I come here, I'll make sure to call in beforehand since it's extremely busy on the weekends. When you walk inside, the entire restaurant greets you in typical Japanese fashion, and if it's your birthday, they do a loud song with a sign and sake bombs - making it a very public fair. Overall, I love the atmosphere, which is loud, fun and full of energy. I would definitely consider going to one of the Toronto branches for my birthday!For drinks, we ordered the saketini, since all of the plum wine based drinks were sold out. The pitcher was $22 and was enough for 4 glasses (1 glass is $7.5, so you save about $10). We ordered 4 small plates in total, and were really full by the end. We ordered one of their specials, the salmon sashimi in sweet soy sauce and a hint of wasabi ($7.5), which was fresh and flavorful but quite small. We also ordered Kabocha Korroke, which are deep fried pumpkin croquettes with an egg baked in the middle ($6). This is vegetarian, and probably one of my favorite dishes. The texture of the pumpkin is like sticky rice, with a crispy outside layer. It's also quite big and filling for $6. We ordered the Kinoko Bibimbap ($9.8), which comes with rice in a sizzling stone bowl, mushrooms, cheddar cheese and seaweed sauce, which they mix together when served. This was also delicious, and quite large - far more than enough for 2 people. Lastly, we ordered the Saba Oshizushi ($12.8), the most expensive dish on our list. It came with 6 pieces of saba on top of square rice blocks. It was good, but maybe not worth the $13 we paid for it, since it was quite small. We finished with the green tea cheesecake for dessert ($6.5). It wasn't the fluffy Japanese cheescake consistency that we were expecting, but since both of us love cheesecake, we devoured it within minutes. Overall, we each paid about $44 after tax and tip, definitely not bad for how much alcohol and food we ate, as well as how much fun we had. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal! It's also very close to the Guy-Concordia Metro Station on the Green line so it's easy to get to."
/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If you don't like/know what tapas are or what an Izakaya is, I can explain it for you! Izakaya is the Japanese term for a restaurant that serves tapas. Tapas are small appetizers that you order. Rather than ordering one dish. You order multiple dishes for yourself or to share. I came here for a friend's birthday. This is a great place to celebrate one's birthday because they offer drink deals for groups. If you ever want to try a sake bomb, this is the place to try it. The waitresses scream ""When I say SAKE, you say BOMB"". This goes on for about 4 times; meanwhile everyone is hitting the table so that the shot of sake that is balanced on chopsticks can fall into the glass. We didn't get sake bombs; however, our entire group managed to try a lot of the different foods that they offered on the menu. I ordered the okonomiyaki, which is a Japanese pan fried pancake with vegetable and octopus, and a mackerel and tuna tartare that you roll in seaweed. It was pretty good! Make sure you eat the okonomiyaki when it's hot! We waited until everyone received their food and by the time we all received our food, the pancake was slightly cold. It was decent. I usually only eat authentic Japanese food, and the food here was pretty good. It wasn't super authentic, but it was still Japanese food. They also have a very typical Japanese atmosphere with the employees yelling 'Welcome' in Japanese. The menu items were decently priced. Some items were a bit overpriced. My meal came to about $15, which was good considering on the amount of food I got. Overall, this was a decent restaurant if you want to eat Japanese food!"

So salty that I had to drink my water plus my boyfriend's after the first bite. The beef carpaccio is so small that even my chihuahua would be hungry after eating it. And the karrage  is supposed to be crispy. Forget it. It feels like they fried it and THEN put it in the microwave when someone is ready to order. Also. The salad they put in the plate is disgusting. Either they let the chicken way too long on it or it was borderline ready to kill itself but it was not appealing. And the service. Gosh. We waited at least 25 mins between every plate that we had ordered. So service not good. Food not good. Experience. Not good."
/user_details?userid=vIP4FGgIWE_Y_Uk7isuc4A,Danny T.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,I was excited to try this restaurant since I have only had great dining experiences at Guu Izakaya in Toronto and was told it was the same owners.Kinka needs to step up their game if they want to survive in downtown Montreal.  I will start with the positives.  The waitress provided great service and was knowledgable of the menu.  Beer was good and the udon noodle with beef and mushroom was very good.  The fish tacos I was served was a mistake.  The taco shell was dry and cold.  The onion cold slaw was cold and the fried fish was warm...very strange temperature for a taco and terrible shell. My friend did not eat half the taco shell because of bad aftertaste.   The beef short ribs were served cold and dry.  It lacked flavored and appeared to have been cooked the day before.  Finally the octopus wasabi paled in comparison to the version served at Guu Izakaya.  They need to improve execution.  They also need to rethink a few of the dishes.  At the end of the dinner I gave my feedback to the waitress.  She apologized and removed the tacos and Beef ribs from the bill.  Very good gesture.   I hope the manager takes the feedback and fixes the problems.  Kazu and Idamake are much better choices.

It is just okay: nothing I would not find anywhere else, except by a horrible service provided by that old Japanese lady who asked for my ID in order to enter the establishment, even when I was not planning to order alcohol. I ended up leaving the second (and last) time I went. Your type of restaurant if you are already drunk and looking for some strenuous noise and an unjustifiable bankrupt."

My folks liked the food ok, they didn't know what to expect having never been to an izakaya so I was happy they weren't disappointed. I was happy to try a place I hadn't been to before but somehow I feel like I won't be drawn back. The flavours seemed a little off or flat and the sauces were a little... I dunno.. krafty? to me in the classic dishes like the okonomiyaki and the takoyaki. The karaage was super delicious so if I did end up there again I'd know what to order, and I loved the grapefruit cocktail I ordered as well. I guess I wanted it to taste more like loving home cooking and that's not quite what I got. Also, I'll be honest, I hadn't quite realized that this spot was in the Faubourg building and since I'd grown up hearing stories about the food safety situations that had passed through there over the years that gave me the creeps as well."

The restaurant is pretty large and has a lot of seating. I sat at the bar. I think I would like to try this place again in the middle of the week or for lunch. The place was extremely loud, because several large groups of people were taking sakebombs every few minutes. I think the staff yells something and then the patrons yell something back whenever they get shots. I ordered the wasabi octopus, a sashimi salad, and the blackened miso cod. The octopus had waaaay too much wasabi on it. You know that moment of panic when you eat too much wasabi and you think you might die? That happened with every bite. It was also really small. Just, not worth it in my opinion. The sashimi salad was awesome though. It was bigger than I thought it would be (enough for a light meal) and was really delicious. The blackened cod is the star of the show though. It was buttery and had rich flavors. I'd go back just for this. Honestly, I'd probably give this place a 3.5, but I'm rounding up because of the cod."

The menu has numerous options, cold dishes, hot dishes, fried dishes, noodles and rice dishesWe were only 2 so we didn't order that much... first we had the Kakuni (pork belly and boiled egg) which was absolutely amazing. If you've read my other reviews you'd know that I love a well made pork belly, and this was good! Perfectly marinated, melts in your mouth perfection. I would give it 5 stars just for that. Then we had the Takoyaki (octopus balls), compared to the ones in Japan... not as good, but compared to the ones I've had in Montreal, they're pretty decent though I found it was a little too dense, but the outside was nice a and crispy. Next dish we had the Karaage (deep fried chicken) with garlic mayo dip. Not the best fried chicken I've had but it wasn't bad. Last dish we had was the Gindara (grilled miso marinated black cod). I usually love this dish but I found it to be a little too salty and I enjoyed it less than I expected, and I was really looking forward to it too! Overall the dishes were generally good, some amazing, and one fell a little short. The atmosphere is awesome, the staff are great too.

It worked out to roughly $50 per person including tip and taxes - we all had cocktails / beer and plenty of food. Very satisfying! I highly recommend for big groups! If you go with a group of people, take note that they do not split the bill by individual. They can split it all equally so that everyone gets a bill, but they won't keep track of who ordered what. This wasn't a  problem for my group, we shared everything and just split everything evenly. We had too many dishes to list here (I think we tried everything) but some of my faves were the tempura veggies with matcha salt, fried chicken, pork belly, Japanese style chicken wings and I loved the sake mojito!"

All in all we spent around 2 hrs waiting for our total of 5 plates with some long waits in between. 1 plate followed by a 30min wait then another, and another. Maybe was just an off night for them.

/user_details?userid=CF5mBTvWst06skMiT7sy7A,Rachel Y.,"San Diego, CA",1 star rating,The only positive: good food. The downside: 45 minutes from when we were seated until they asked for our order. By the end of the night we were LITERALLY filling out own water after taking a pitcher from the serving station. NOT worth it.
/user_details?userid=iAS1fd-iKqya1xshoCC5Eg,Sarah S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I know it's a bar...but it's so LOUD in here you can barely hear each other. Everything is so damn overpriced and food portion is teenie tiny, we had to go somewhere else to eat again. Staffs are unfriendly, unprofessional and all they do is yell around in Japanese and interrupt your conversation. Overall, I would not recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=HzuMaeMd7BpFXlU96YDnfw,Vanessa Y.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here on a Friday night with my bestie, and had a great time! Firstly, the staff cumulatively greet you as you enter and leave, which I thought was awesome. I could imagine some might find this annoying, as there was lots of yelling and noise. We decided to share a couple of dishes, so that we could try multiple things. I don't remember all of the dish names, unfortunately, but we got the edamame (standard), the oyster dish (creamy and cheesy goodness), the octopus balls (fried, delicious), the salmon sushi (fresh, salmon perfectly cooked - still slightly raw), and a tuna dish (didn't get to try this, but my friend said it was yummy). Overall, everything was fresh and so delicious! We were at the bar, and got to see the cooks doing their thing. So fun! They also have an outdoor terrasse, and are located right near Le faubourg (heart of downtown, near guy concordia). I will say that service was a little slow, it took a while to order and pay, but I would definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=PVOtG_2eJOnJLoLmT_rQig,Shelvin S.,"Berkeley, CA",4 star rating,"Superb! The service is great, and the food is quite delicious, however, a few items didn't have great presentation. The place is also quite loud, with the staff randomly cheering throughout the service. It adds to a very 'hip' urban ambiance, with seemingly 'traditional' menu items. They have a decent sake selection. I'd recommend anyone to check this place out!"

/user_details?userid=zJMW0W1932Uv9AV6GPV-Og,Audrey V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Pretty good.I just don't recommend the okonomiyaki. Its deep fried and not hot plate cooked like traditionally. Same with the takoyaki. Gindara is tasty though..lots of stuff here is premade and expensive. Very loud environment.
/user_details?userid=XGigzqBBqhsdty9uKmKiwA,John T.,"Groton, NY",5 star rating,"My wife and I had dinner this past Saturday evening. The food was wonderful. We particularly enjoyed the sashimi, which was extremely fresh. The service during our meal was attentive and warm, but it was our post-meal experience that exceeded my expectations. I stupidly left my mobile phone at the restaurant and didn't realize it until the next morning. We live in upstate New York and had to head home before the restaurant opened. I called (using my wife's cell phone) and spoke with one of the staff members who appeared to take very copious notes as I described the situation. She then told me I could expect a call from a manager shortly. Sure enough, Yumeho Ikoma called and instructed me to simply email my contact details to her and she'd take care of it. This morning I received an email confirmation this morning that my phone is on the way. I truly appreciate the follow-up and follow-through, especially since it was my bad. High marks all the way around!"

The food was so bad, I ordered a ramen and it was basically a broth with noodles, salmon tataki was extremely bad. It was a bad experience. Don't ever trust a restaurant that has pictures on the menu."

But everything here was too salty. Beef ribs were black and scorched. Staffs are unfriendly, no smile on their face and they gave us wrong meal and bill."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been here twice since its opening and it seems like the food quality varied between the two visits. I've been to several Guu restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto and even though the menu is more or less the same, it all depends on who is cooking the dish (sometimes it's greasier/saltier/soggier and sometimes it is just perfect). Regardless, it's usually a fun place to have a birthday party for larger groups.The dish I can never go without is the kabocha korokke. When done properly, it's crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with a tiny quail egg hidden in the center and dipped in a flavourful mayo sauce. The Kakimayo is also a favorite of mine in the winter. It is very much like a rockefeller oyster. It comes out piping hot, so don't burn yourself. It is a very filling portion. The karaage (crispy chicken) is nothing special, it's just fried chicken.  The kabocha zenzai dessert is a bowl  of  soft/mushy textured Asian desserts overlying pureed kabocha that will not suit everyone's taste. The best option is to pick items off the day's special. I always choose 2-3 items from the list and have never regretted it. The reason I didn't rate this place higher was because I once arrived one person short in my dinner party and the waiter literally gave her spot away after 20 minutes (even though we had started ordering) and we had to argue to get the seat back. It made for a very stressful eating experience. If I have the choice (ie small party of less than 3-4 people) and the patience  to wait more than 30 minutes for supper, I would always choose to go to Kazu down the block, but Kinka is a very decent alternative for larger groups and impatient people."
/user_details?userid=6izTeSNcjDXvV6DFNGgYXA,Super N.,"Salamanca, Spain",1 star rating,"Similar to most of the reviews, we were a group of 10 and got a really poor service. They just bring out the plates and don't know to which person it belongs to. The check out was a nightmare as well. We had to go through the long bill and mark up which plates was ours (none of the server wanted to give us their pen?) and charged a gratuity of 18%. Honestly its ridiculous because there wasn't really any service provided (we had to ask for water, plates not coming out at same time for everyone and some waited a while, they even left the plates on the table and let us figure out to whom it belongs to, they gave us the bill and some of the plates were still missing). We didn't enjoyed the food much. The tuna tartare seems like it went into a blender and not handcut for example.The only nice thing are the decorations and atmosphere. But the poor service will just ruin your night out if you are a big group."
/user_details?userid=zYuFBaUFoxMC1XEUaDI5iA,Beth R.,"Conifer, CO",1 star rating,"Not recommended if you want consistency. Stopped in on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was packed and busy!! Had a look at the menu and realized it wasn't a sushi bar like we thought, but decided to stay! It was sake flight night for the special. Placed our order: sake and sashimi, gyoza, and calamari. Seemed pretty easy for a Japanese restaurant. Waited forever to get the sake, while the people two tables down, who came in considerably later than we did, received their drinks. After 20 minutes, and asking the waitress to check on our order, we received the sake. Still zero food, although I watched the table behind us order two or three times from the menu, (it's like a tapas bar) and receive their food after about five minutes. Ditto for the table next to us. We received our sashimi, wayyyyy after we finished our sake flight (it was a combo). We received our gyoza about 20 minutes later. Still no calamari. Finally, we just gave up, left money for what we ate, and went next door to an amazing chocolate shop. Just visiting Montreal, so safe to say we won't be back. I do highly recommend Juliet and Chocolate next door."

Even my mom was in love with Kinka Izakaya. Too bad I couldn't eat there because I'm a minor, but I could tell that they are very excited to bring me there once I turn 18. They loved the environnement, the big space and especially the workers and their unique way of greeting people. Good job."

When I opened the containers the sushi was smushed together and fell apart. I was also promised extra sushi for the long wait but received 2 miso soups instead. On the phone I was told that the total price would come out to 63$ but I had to pay 73$ because there was ""an extra charge for making a special spider roll."" I would not recommend ordering from this place."
/user_details?userid=SCei-y8SFPy7xfFB7xU_wQ,Tia L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Very disappointed! I had made reservations through the Yelp app. When I got there with my daughter the 2 waitress stop us at the door and ask my daughter for her ID ?  I have never been stop at the door of a restaurant to be ID!  NO minor allow in this restaurant!  I never heard anything like this before it's not like a strip joint! So are you telling me that All restaurant with a liquor license is not allowed to have any minors in the restaurant?  What kind of BS is that???  Yelp where is your thumbs down rating?
/user_details?userid=bEN3YFA6g8AavPTF-zs8Iw,R L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,the main advantage of this place is that they serve passable Japanese food much later at night than anywhere else. Secondly the Staff are very good. Drink specials are extremely economical. Don't forget it's became a place for drunk people to loudly display their drunkness. But we are right beside a university. Another plus is that this place has a tremendously better decor and food than the competition.  So really this is your best choice for Japanese after 10 in the whole of the province of Quebec.

/user_details?userid=6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",4 star rating,"The whole restaurant yells a greeting when you walk through the front door!They are not so great at refilling the water. But are so polite that if you ask they will. It's a tapas place so a good idea to order many plates for the table. Children under 18 are not allowed because it has a bar. The tuna sashimi, tuna carpaccio ""toro carru"", seaweed salad, short ribs, vegetarian gyoza (fried) are some of the best. Check the menu that has specials of the day. For dessert, the green tea cheese cake is the best. And green tea ice cream is good too. You can order grape fruit vodka and it comes with a fresh grape fruit for you to squeeze. The service is extremely friendly and very fast. They made a big chaotic show out of my brother's birthday with all the staff. With noise, a sign and a personalized photo! Amazing customer service. They split the bill for large groups which is very nice. We ate as much as we wanted and the bill only came to about $35 per person. You get frozen grapes with your bill."

I would give this a place a zero star if that option exists. We walk in and we're standing by the door for about 2 minutes before a server came up to us to serve us and other servers past by and saw us but didn't help even acknowledge us. There wasn't a table for us so we had to wait 20 minutes for one, nevertheless, we decided to wait. Don't get me wrong, the interior is very modern looking with their wooden tables and chairs and the food was good as well but the portions are very small. It's very noisy with all the yelling and screaming and the customer service here is very poor. After I asked our server for the bill, he went to the table in front of ours and asked for their order and it would be another 10 minutes before he comes back with the bill. This place needs to hire more staff, I will not be coming back here."
/user_details?userid=XkzFfufzJWFcuOdk0nTrzA,Katrina T.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"I LOVE this place! And have been here many times. It's an easy atmosphere to enjoy so you can come alone or on a date or just to hang out with friends. And because it's like tapas, you can spend as much or as little as you wish. I would highly recommend the sushis and sashimis, especially the scallops! The marinated jellyfish is addictive (If you've never had jellyfish before, it's similar to seaweed, say a wakame salad). The pork will melt in your mouth and you cannot miss the black cod with miso, you will never enjoy fish the same way again"
