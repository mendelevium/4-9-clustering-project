/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Superb selection of fresh fish complimented by an interesting (if somewhat expensive) wine list. The value in the wine list lies in the deep selection of Portugese wines. The sommelier is very approachable and provides solid guidance across price points and pallat preferences.I have been to Ferreira twice and highly recommend the crispy octopus app. The signature black cod dish is also outstanding, but honestly I don't think you can go wrong with any of the fish selections. They have a variety of fresh fish on ice as daily specials so don't be afraid to go off menu!  The ambiance is chic/modern with house music playing in the background which makes for a great atmosphere. They have an open kitchen and it's really fun to watch the chefs work their magic on the line. On my second visit, my wife and I were seated at a two-top directly across from the kitchen and I highly recommend that table if you enjoy the show!"
/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",4 star rating,"Located on Peel St, across from les Cours Mont-Royal, I had passed by this restaurant hundreds of times and never considered it a dining option. But I stumbled across it as I was planning my itinerary this recent trip to Montreal and was looking forward to well-prepared Portuguese cuisine.On a Sunday evening, the restaurant was packed, should I say, like Portuguese sardines (sorry, I could not resist). The happy guests created a joyful ambiance in both dining areas. We inhaled the crusty bread as we savored the grilled calamari appetizer and chatted about family, careers, and upcoming trips. The thick rings of meaty calamari were well prepared and served with a sweet puréed squash, complemented by the vinaigrette.Typically, I have duck when it is on the menu but I had already had duck two nights in a row and already knew duck was on the menu the following day. Luckily, I also love seafood bouillabaisse so I ordered it without hesitation or reservation. The cast-iron pot that arrived at the table contained large chunks of fish, plump langoustines, clams, and calamari, in a savory broth. While everything in the pot was tasty, the fish was particularly meaty and tender.For dessert, there was no doubt that I would have the Portuguese egg tarts. The dessert was actually one of the reasons I selected this restaurant. Two small bite-sized tarts, with flaky crusts and a brûléed top, were served with a spoonful of rice milk ice cream. How did I never have this; it was worth the wait!While our server was helpful and accommodating, there were too many guests the evening we visited so service was slower than I would have liked."
/user_details?userid=h0fNBxo0qFtrxX59PIzv1g,Susan D.,"Danville, CA",5 star rating,"So I'll start this review off with the fact that eating out has become so difficult since starting the FODMAP diet back in April. I've learned I can't eat onions and garlic the two veggies that seem to be the base of everything!?!?! And we're my favorite, but if I don't eat them I feel so much better... ugh.So as you can imagine eating out with me isn't fun. So here we are on vacation, I'm trying to be careful but enjoy myself. Tonight was the night, I picked this restaurant off of yelp and being close to our hotel. What a great choice! We showed up at 8 pm on a Friday night with no reservations, were offered outside or at the bar inside. We picked inside at the bar. Comfortable highback bar chairs, and were able to sit down immediately. Restaurant was full and a bit noisy with talking and music, but definitely a cozy atmosphere. We ordered grilled octopus as a starter, and I informed the gal behind the bar of my onion/garlic dilemma. She guided me with the menu, even going back to the kitchen to make sure what was safe for me to order. We decided that the steak was probably the safest, and I was okay with that tonight. They also when bringing the octopus out stated ""no garlic"". Then they brought a tray with cod balls(they informed me I couldn't have these because they had garlic in them), cream cheese, tapenade and olive oil to go with this absolutely divine earthy brown bread (made in house-I asked). Then my Fred flintstone size steak arrived with a side of crisp frites and lovely seasoned broccoli/green beans/bok Choy. I have to tell you this was probably one of the best meals I've had out since this whole elimination diet that has restricted me. The steak and the veggies seasoned perfectly, frites crispy... I mean I couldn't finish the steak, but it was so delicious. If for some reason you happen to be on a low-FODMAP diet and are in Montreal, looking for a moderately higher end meal you won't be disappointed. This made me so happy!"

Fun atmosphere - especially seated in front of the kitchen area where you could watch the hustle and bustle and see them prep all the different dishes of food headed for other tables.  I had the special that evening, which was a poutine topped with chunks of lobster prepared in a dark bisque.  It was interesting and was good - but the star of the evening was the sauteed shrimp appetizer in a garlic sauce.  Whole succulent shrimp with a sauce so good I mopped it up with sliced bread."

The food is delicious and you get an appetizer with your main dish. I started with the tomato salad followed by the pan seared fish of the day (Turbot fish). The fish was soft, tasty, not overly salty and served over a nicely made risotto.I wish I had room to try their dessert. Would love to visit again on my next visit to the city. The ambience is fun and very nice, the service at the bar was quick."
/user_details?userid=2tOny3tty9BlhrGRLWPHqA,Christina C.,Hong Kong,4 star rating,"Dining out in Montreal's winter is not easy, especially where there is a cold weather advisory and it is -16C (5F) outside.  You've got to go to restaurants that are really worth it!The octopus appetizer here is absolutely divine.  One of my best bites in 2019 for sure!The carabinero risotto (it is called something else on the menu) was very tasty but there was something off about it at the same time.  The broth was rich and bursting with flavors but a bit too salty for me.  The fava beans tasted a bit strange but the strangest of all was the half cooked carabineros.  Not sure if they were meant to be medium rare but biting into a cold centre was weird, especially the brains... With that said, it is a very good meal overall.  I will return to try their black cod next time!"
/user_details?userid=rvqMuvq4hYt3t7deFFSiaA,Anas R.,"Brighton, MA",5 star rating,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in the area so far. I got a suggestion from American Express card about this place. The waiting staff was so friendly and they knew me by name. I made a reservation and wait time was 5 minutes. The tables and ambience was fancy. The staff was very helpful. I tried the oysters at first. They were very fresh tasting. The sauce was great. They had multiple choices for catch of day. I tried the branzino. The fish was very tender, flavorful a d fresh. It was one of the best fish dishes I had in a long time. Of note, they seem to be proud of their oil here. They provide some with bread in the beginning. And it was so good I had to buy a bottle from them. I will definitely come back whenever I'm in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=XP8PzCFQJvR1eRChwgn2Bg,Kyla C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Went back to this place because I had such a good experience the first time, and it was equally as great. I went with my boyfriend this time and he was extremely pleased as well. We got the sardines as an appetizer to start, and they were to die for. The sardines were grilled to absolute perfection and it was plated absolutely beautifully as well. And again, like the last time, I got the seafood casserole and it was just as good as I remembered, and stated in my last review, (my boyfriend thought the same thing).The flavours at Ferreira's have a nostalgic tinge to them as they remind me of my childhood and grandmother and mothers cooking. Going there is almost like a home away from home and is something that'll bring me back again and again. The service was also amazing. Our server was extremely attentive and overall knowledgeable with amazing suggestions. Like I said, I will come back here again and again, and I cannot recommend it enough."

I take this as a good sign as long as service is not affected and it was perfectly executed. Chapeau!I took the aragula and são george cheese salad wich was very tasty but from my collegues plate it was the octopus that was the most beautiful plate. For the main plate I took the cod, matane shrimps and spinach gratin. It was incredibly tasty and good but so filling! I ate half of it and was completely full. I'm not small eater normally and I love food so much I'd rather feel like a huge potatoe than leave good food on a plate. And yet, i sadly couldn't finish this. Overall, ferreira is a lovely place.

It looked really amazing so I wanted to try it. I went there on a Sunday evening. Its situated on Peel street, in front of Cours Mont-Royal. The inside is really pretty, great ambiance music not too loud  but enough to give it a nice mood.  I was able to have a conversation.As for the food, everything was amazing from the grilled calmari to the fresh salad, to the amazing rosted hen. Deserts we fantastic too, I suggest the taster platter where you get a variety of mini desserts. Staff was great, they even check-in your coat, which is fantastic specially with those big winter coats.I will definetily go back.UPDATEI went back a few weeks ago and it was even better than last time. I love the buzz and atmosphere in this place. Staff is great, food is delicious, you basically can't stop eating, it's that good. Very high quality food!!!! Love love love."

/user_details?userid=nEfgsjRDRmxx7nNFVZi0jw,Darryl R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Upscale Portuguese restaurant. Got a table in front of the kitchen, which was a lot of fun to watch. We ordered all appetizers: Roasted sardines, crispy octopus on black bean hummus, a seafood crudo special, the grilled calamari with squid ink crumble, and finishing with a green salad with burrata and pecorino cheese,. The grilled calamari was our favorite and most abundant with an entire squid. The special crudo was the most flavorful, and enjoyable. Our least favorite was the sardines which overpowered the other favors of the dish (could barely taste the horseradish). We have had Portuguese sardines before and this was not up to par. The best part of the dinner was our waiter, who spent a lot of time describing the dishes, cooks and restaurant - it was quite educational. Our second favorite restaurant on the trip (Tiradito was #1). Recommended."

/user_details?userid=ZZeObu-3isiW7WczA9_Y8Q,Tess R.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Food: 5/5; Came here for lunch, which began with two slices of warm soft bread and the house olive oil, which was so pure-tasting. Ordered the crispy octopus for appetizer and the day's fresh fish, which was cod over a vegetable stew. Both dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cod especially was flaky and not outdone by the bed of roasted vegetables. Service: 1/5; I sat at the bar and my waitress/bartender was very demeaning. After being seated, I was approached by the waitress and asked if I was ""going to have a big-girl meal at the bar,"" presumably because I was an English-only speaking out-of-town female eating alone in a restaurant filled by businessmen having lunch. I'm 30 years old. I didn't pay the pretty penny I did to be so belittled. And this demeaning waitress' case wasn't helped by the fact that 10 minutes later, a French-speaking female who appeared to be my age sat down next to me and was tended to with the utmost respect.So if you visit Ferreira and are served by a middle-aged woman with long brown hair, glasses, and a full set of corrective teeth braces, be prepared for rudeness."

/user_details?userid=nBotK5rAhsUCkBKhzShKXA,Melis B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,So for my birthday dinner we decided to finally eat here. The food is really really good. I mean I'm a fan of seafood so it doesn't disappoint. The bill is hefty so that is just something to prepare for. Some people enjoy spending money on food others don't. This is preference.  The problem I have is this: service! If you are going to charge the amount you do and rate yourself as a high end dining establishment you have got to be spot in with your service. It took about an hour before the appetizers reached us and the same time before we got drinks. Main course was an other hour after that. It's a funny thing service it really has a way of not making you want to go back even though the food was very very good. This has to do with what high end dining has become : an experience ! You want the whole shebang especially when you are paying for it.

/user_details?userid=ko4Ptc0Mc1xEQgS1NHs_ew,Winnie L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Was with colleagues in Montreal for business and we asked at our hotel to recommend a good local restaurant that was not a chain and they recommended Ferreira Café which was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. When I looked it up on Yelp, I had already bookmarked it but had not tried it before. It was a Thursday night so it was busy but there were open tables for a party of 3. Our waitress was very helpful in explaining to us that they source a lot of fresh seafood directly from Portugal and that was their specialty. She recommended that we could share a fresh grouper and she brought it to the table to show us. For appetizers, we shared the grilled calamari, yellowfin tuna crudo and sautéed wild shrimp with garlic, white wine, lemon, and piri-piri.  For the main course, we shared the grilled whole grouper and the seafood bouillabaisse. We had bread with goat cheese, olive tapenade and olive oil to start. The yellowfin tuna app was the best. It was fresh and the flavours worked really well. The crispy chip on top gave the dish some texture. The wild shrimp was good too and had a bit of a kick to it. The spicy oil sauce from the shrimp made a good dip with the bread that was provided. The grilled calamari was excellent as well - tasty and tender. The grouper main dish was served whole and the waitress deboned the fish and served us at the table. The grouper was grilled with some salt and was excellent. It was so tender and meaty and seasoned perfectly. The grouper came with Brussel sprouts and vegetables on the side. We finished the grouper first before eating the bouillabaisse as that was kept warm in the Le Crueset dish. Our waitress then served us the bouillabaisse. The seafood in the bouillabaisse was very fresh and tender but the soup base was lacking some flavour. This was a bit of a disappointment after eating the amazing grouper. This was more than enough food for the three of us. For dessert, we had the Natas-these were vanilla tarts as well as the Floating Island. These were both very good. Overall, we all enjoyed the meal very much and agreed that this was a place for us to come back."

This time, we went for the late night menu (available after 10pm) for $24. We got the soup and sardine for appetizer and chicken and tartar for main courses. I also got the passion fruit  mille feuille for dessert. The food was decent, but maybe because it was late at night? Everything felt very rough. The chicken was literally piled on a bunch of fries with very little presentation. Don't get me wrong, the tartar was fresh and the chicken was tasty. Maybe my expectation was too high for this restaurant. The service was worse than what I expected as well. We had to wait for the waiter to refill our water despite there were very little people in the restaurant. Short conclusion, food was good, service was just ok."

/user_details?userid=RTtdNQrhqbcGPARn2A2ifw,Peng L.,"Rosemont, IL",4 star rating,"The restaurant is best with its thoughtfully designed dishes, but the overall experience is weakened by the unthoughtful service, or simply the waiter that we have encountered.Fresh caught menu offers a pleasant surprise. We've ordered Mediterranean bass cooked in whole. The grilled fish is juicy and tender under crispy skin. Mildly salted and spices, the cooking brought out the essence of the fish's natural taste. The dish comes with a special salsa, grilled greens and mashed sweet potato. The salsa goes well with the fish because the overall sour taster and rich texture really invigorate the tasting buds, making the fish feels even more fresh and tender. The salsa contains some green peppercorn-like pickles in addition to the regular ingredients, and it is not soupy. The mashed sweet potato is richer and more interesting.The seafood Bouillabaisse is a potato-base soup with a variety of seafood and potato. It's adequate portion and it was brought in a warm le crueset cast iron oven. Well proportioned ingredients and fresh seafood make the dish better than similar dishes in other places, and it is a good choice for a winter my dinner.We've also tried the grilled calamari for appetizer. The calamari is of good quality and grilled to a turn, but tastes a bit bland in itself. The green sauce is herbal and bitter, yet complemented with the sweet orange color sauce, giving dish quite an interesting flavor. Now comes the downside. The waiter is rather unresponsive and cold, offering very little suggestions and make us feel that he does not care. The bread offered before appetizer is cold and tough, quite disappointing comparing to the level of the cuisine this restaurant would like to boast."

The food itself was very well presented and the ingredients were fresh but there was nothing that really stood out especially given the prices I can't say I was blown away by the food. We tried the beef tarter ,seafood bouillabaisse , squid ink risotto and creme brûlée dessert - all the dishes were very beautiful to look at and the ingredients were fresh BUT Portuguese cooking is all about bold bright flavours and all the dishes were enjoyable they were all lacking that little extra something to make them memorable. Our server was friendly and came to check on us frequently , he also made a great wine suggestion to pair with our order. However , there was a man in a suit who I assume was maybe the manager that would also come around and check on the diners and ask us if we needed anything , we asked for more bread for the bouillabaisse and he seemed annoyed which I didn't like. The decor was very nice and elegant and perfect for a date night (they also offer outdoor seating during warmer seasons). I'm happy I finally tried this place but can't say that I plan to go back any time soon ."

Main dishes (whole fish sea bass and black cod) were both very good, but not the same level as appetizers. Service was terrific, very nice room / ambiance. Exceptional weather allowed folding front doors to be open, which added to the ambiance. Overall, a very solid restaurant experience."

The food is marvelous, the ambience is refined and cozy at the same time, service impeccable! You feel like a royal by the treatment received. Your glass of water is always full, you don't even need to ask for salt pepper or another glass of wine, cause the server was prompt right there to anything else we might need. I had the fish of the day, which tasted delicious right temperature perfect preparation. Great selection of Portuguese wines too.

Sat at the bar and the server there was awesome, super friendly, knowledgable and helpful.She explained the menu and how the fresh fish system works with the weights, filleting, types of fish etc.We ended up getting her octopus appy recommendation, and the daily catch. She recommended a Portuguese fish that's very popular at the restaurant, saying that it has a slightly nutty flavour. I forget the name but I will post a photo of it.The octopus appy was delicious, perfectly cooked. Beautiful texture and flavour.Then came the fish which is filleted and served Infront of you after it's cooked. The fish was incredible, it was moist, fatty, flavourful, kind of silky in a way. And the veggies and sauce to go along with it matched well. We really felt spoiled and lucky to have gotten a seat there.If ever back in Montreal, we will be eating here again. Great restaurant - decor, ambience, cleanliness, service and food....all wonderful and very well done."

/user_details?userid=pcR8r6IS0Ui1_oucpqS67w,Kat C.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Has to be the best meal I've ever eaten in Montreal. What a nice surprise from a last-minute decision on a Friday night!I am more used to New World wines, and found the wine list challenging to interpret. Our waiter didn't seem too fussed about explaining some options. Service in general was a little reserved, but this could well have been because we were speaking English to a very francophone staff.We started with the charcuterie board, which was notable for a really delicious duck terrine. Pleasantly, the capers and olives were quite good quality on their own, not just space fillers. I had the porcini-encrusted black cod, and kind of felt like crying when it was gone. This was some of the best fish I've ever eaten. Beautifully cooked, silky and rich and light all at once. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side were also outstanding. The few bites I had of the duck confit and mushroom risotto were gorgeous, and I say that as a firm risotto avoider.This was not a cheap meal, but it was worth every cent. Unlike some pricey meals, which are made up of a few bites on a series of plates, I was honestly too full for dessert by the end of the evening (which I was disappointed about, because the desserts looked great).Quick recommendation: visit the women's bathroom and use the homemade olive oil scrub. Such a random and luxurious offering!My one tiny complaint is a sexist vibe I got from a waiter who came to refill my wine glass and said mine must be empty while my boyfriend's was full because I'd been ""talking away."" An annoying comment at any time, but especially grating when you're at a nice restaurant and feel it's not the place to make a scene."

Manager who seemed to be the owner did not show any concern of our poor experience. Communication at this place is horrible. Fist time at a Portuguese restaurant and was not taken the time to explain to us and seemed irritated with us for asking questions and basically walked away without explaining any further. Wait time for apps and entrees were about 45 minutes in between. Waiting for our check another 45 minutes. What a waste of our time (on vacation) so left with no time to explore the rest of the night. Left the place still hungry. It was the most awkward experience we've ever had in our lives.
/user_details?userid=bvFDEgoSiDdvCbC1OcRdfw,Jonathan G.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"It was my wife's birthday so I decided to take her on a small trip to Montreal to celebrate (we're from Toronto). She's really enjoys Portuguese food so I decided to take her to Ferreira, it seemed like a no-brainer. Looking back at it now, I wish we never went there. The food was fine, I will give them their full credit there. The seafood was prepared very well, especially the octopus in our starter, the grilled seafood for two. It was crispy on the outside and soft (not chewy) on the inside.The problem with our experience was with the service. This evening was supposed to feel special for my wife, but we were forgotten by our server so often that we felt anything but.Despite them being notified (via the notes section on the online reservation form) that it was my wife's birthday we experienced the following:- 20 minutes to get a glass of wine (it would have been longer if I did not remind our server)- Our sides came so long after our mains that we were left with cold seafood casserole and hot vegetables.- We asked for more bread, but it never came (it seemed to find its way to the table beside us when they asked, though) - Even when we asked for the bill (we just wanted to get out of there) we were left out to dry until I decided to remind our serverAfter we paid (a $185 tab) we made our way to the door. Our server stopped me and admitted, ""I'm sorry I've left you hanging all night."" I shook his hand and walked out with my wife. Outside, I turned to her and admitted, ""I'm sorry that I brought you here.""Maybe you feel like I'm being a bit dramatic here. Trust me, I'm not the type. If this is just me and the guys on a regular night out, sure I can suck it up. Joke about it, talk a little trash maybe. Definitely not take the time to write out a review. But I ask you, how am I supposed to feel when I see the look on my wife's face gradually go from excitement and anticipation to that of a woman who feels forgotten and unimportant on a day that she holds dear? If I am asked to recount the experience, how can I not call to attention her dissatisfaction?So because of that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that anyone give Ferreira their patronage. The quality of their food cannot make up for the disappointment that is their service."

We sat across from the open kitchen- which I love seeing! We were greeted by a super friendly and patient server. We ordered the octopus appetizer which we both enjoyed. The black cod was ok- a bit bland,  but I really loved their Portuguese salsa I ordered on the side! My husband ordered the seafood bouillabaisse with a lobster mixed in. He was disappointed with the small quantity of the lobster but overall he liked his dish. Not a bad place to try out for an evening of splurging if only for the ambience and great service."

For the interior looks I would give 5*, but you don't give stars just for that. Food is very very below the average. Tried lots of things there hoping for the better flavor, but I'm disappointed. There are missing the absolute Portuguese classic flavors. The seafood for two is ridiculously over priced - 1. Such small portion (cold & hot)  and the hot version which you'd expect would have some interestig flavor - shockingly it is not tasty at all. 2. Fried calmari starter is the poorest quality choice as well. 3. And sizes are super duper tiny, not only in options for two. I'm a Seafood/Portugese Cuisine lover so the fact that they lack on at least one solid  traditional butter-garlic tasty seafood is very disappointing. Better to not go there and fly to Lisbon instead, that's how expensive and low value it is. Feeling bad also for the absolutely beautiful and sweet waitresses , for they are wasting their lives there, they should move to Hollywood or get into serious modeling or acting carrier. Service was great. That is the ONLY plus there can be. Disappointed with the tasteless and unlike the Portuguese food, and would not want it for free if someone wanted to offer it to me.

Everything is so fresh, large portion and cooked perfectly. Bouilliabaisse  - seafood soup, actually not much soup, but again the seafood was good. Seafood Rice - love this the most, the flavors (tomato, saffron??) can't find anywhere else. Rice is a bit hard for my personal taste but love the sauce and the meaty seafood. For dessert we had warm fig cake with sweet potato icecream. The cake reminds me of sticky toffee pudding, not too sweet. No sweet potato taste in the icecream, but just as delicious with a cinnamon flavor. I liked this more than the creme brulee."

Nice choice of wine by the glass.  I had crispy octopus as app and it was delicious - tender, crispy and ocean salty -perfectly cooked.  Had whole-roasted sea bass as an appetizer and it was perfectly cooked.  Food server expertly deboned the fish table side.  Moist, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  Unfortunately for us, at this point a party of 16 was seated near us and we lost our waiter.  He was hard to track down at this point.  We enjoyed a couple more drinks and headed out after dinner.  Would have struck around for dessert but we our waiter was otherwise occupied by the 16.  He was attentive early on and we did enjoy our meal and service overall."

The calamari was prepared so tenderly that it tasted like lobster, and was presented beautifully (picture attached). For my main course I ordered the bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse was good, but lacked depth of flavor. It wasn't bad, but I expected more after having such an exceptional appetizer.My wife ordered a steak (a filet). There was no option to order a petite stake (under half a pound), so she went with the big one. The steak was well aged and was tender and tasty (one big steak), with accompanied veggies.The service was excellent.All in all, it was a good meal, we tipped the server well, but it didn't rate a return visit."

Another 5 mins to get tap water (which she poured into our wine glasses as she was still watching the table next to us). We ordered and was told we just ordered too little. Fair enough I guess. So we said, let us rethink our order, give us a minute. For the next 15 mins we tried to call her over, but again she was still too busy with the other table... We were invisible.  Enough was enough, so we picked up our stuff and walked over to her and told her we were leaving. She paused and said she had already ordered our food...

By the time we arrive at the end I have to ask the waiter to start again because there were so many things I wanted I can't remember the first ones that were mentioned.

I like my high end restaurants, this is no secret...and last night I've finally got to go! Yay!Good : My side salad and the salmon was really well cooked. Decor is nice, the plating was excellent. Bad : I'll start off with a really awkward seating arrangement. I had to squeeze through a tight space of two other tables to get to my seat by the wall. Fine, I can put up with that. Bread took 20 minutes to arrive. Okay, let me just carb up now because if it takes that long to get bread, I can't imagine how long the appetizers will take. When my sardines appetizer arrived, it came with a weird jelly/fish paste thing on the bottom that looked like smoke salmon. I took a big scoop of that deceitful smoke salmon jelly looking thing (in my defense, I thought it was smoked salmon) and it was probably one of the worst decisions of my life (besides art school). I've ordered the Churrasco style cornish hen as my main course...and quite frankly, it was really dried. Maybe I came in with really high expectations, but I've had better chicken at Romado's for half that price. Bottom line : Water will cost you $5 and it won't come in a Fiji bottle either. Not exactly a good experience, not quite the best Portugese food, not likely returning either."

The rice was delivered to my plate in a very large pot. The bartender served me portions from this pot until I had cleaned it.

It was complete mush. My husband and I are huge fish and seafood fans and both of us could not eat this fish. We would have complained had our waiter shown back up at all, we finally had to get up and to let someone else know we were not happy and would like the bill so we could leave.

The sardines were prepared very classic and simple with olive oil, salt capers and oregano grilled with a slight char, perfection!  The tuna was seared with a Peppercorn crust, raw center and was perfect.For my entree it had to be the black cod. The cod was light, tasted like a sweet buttery almost dessert like dish and was placed atop potato purée. While eating it was sometimes difficult to tell where the cod finished and the potato started. A wonderful dish finished in a wine reduction with porcini mushrooms. I would say this is a must order dish.My favorite meal in Montreal for sure and based on the crowds I saw there there the next afternoon while strolling by, I say it's a favorite for many locals!"

Something for almost everyone.  Eating alone, I had a great view of the restaurant from my secluded corner. Service is excellent, as is the food, though I would say portions are small for the price. I started with 6 oysters from the Madeleine Islands, which were creamy and perfectly briny, well joined with a glass of Albariño.  For my main course, I was in a pickle, as the fresh fish selections all sounded irresistible , but I went ahead with my initial choice, the seafood and rice stew, with added lobster. This is a delectable dish and I ate every morsel. There's a bit of piquancy that really adds to the dish but it's not too spicy to overwhelm other flavors, or put you off. The Shrimp, clams, calamari  & scallops are all nicely done.  My server forgot to add the lobster, however, and that came about 7 minutes later, along with a complimentary glass of Douro to atone for the misstep. What great service! The amount of lobster is small, as another poster mentioned. It was ""half a lobster,"" but really about the smallest tail and claw I've ever seen.  The only less than stellar mark is the bread. Mostly stale French, with a single, fresher sourdough slice that was good with the peppery olive oil.  The dessert list was tantalizing -- I had a hard time choosing but went with the Portuguese creme brûlée.  For the first time ever, not served in a single ramekin, but large dollops dotting the plate, each with a shard of torched sugar atop. A unique citrusy quality made this one of the best versions of a favorite dessert ever!"

They presented it in a such a way that they did the plating tableside.  I was so hungry that I just wanted them to give me the freaking pot, but it made for a cool video."

However, I was very disappointed with the Risotto. It was very salty and also not done. My partner's quail was better in my opinion. The foie gras was probably my favourite though. Rich and great on the bread. The atmosphere of the restaurant is dim and cozy. Next time I would try more of their seafood just to see if there's a difference."

We walked into the restaurant and it took 5 minutes to seat us. They gave us one menu between the two of us. Despite having asked for another menu twice, we never got it. It took half an hour before someone came back to take our order. We ordered a coke (no alcohol on the patio), the scallop and blood sausage spring roll, the cornbread crusted cod, and the vegetable risotto. Shortly afterward, we got served 3 stale dinner roles and a flat glass of coke ($3.75). The table next to us got a different type of bread. I hope theirs was fresh...It was another hour before we got our food. The table next to us arrived later and got their appetizer before us. First, they got the vegetable risotto wrong and gave us the seafood paella. My friend was served his cod, only to have it swapped for a different cod dish. (As it turns out, the first dish he was served was the correct one.) We later witness the messed up order was for intended for the other table, who again would have gotten their order first if it wasn't for the mess up. The appetizer and the original cod dish (which we took a bite of before it was taken away) was delicious. As was the vegetable risotto. The ""corrected"" cod dish was full of bones. The entire meal was 95 for two people. We will not be returning."

The octopus first course with the smoky eggplant puree was exquisitely prepared and presented, with a crispy outside and perfectly delicate texture. Also, the generous portion makes it perfect to share. My husband had the grouper prepared in a Portuguese style (tomatoes and other vegetables and small white potatoes), and I had two types of salt cod and both dishes were the kind of complex and distinct flavors that you taste every morsel, but the dishes also work together as a whole. Who knew what mint could do! The service was attentive, well-informed and professional. And in a charming coincidence, the couple at the next table were also out-of-towners....from our neighborhood!

Cooking 101 fail.  My SO had the '3 meat' combo, which was decent, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we should have gone for the salted cod, but something in me rebelled against paying that much for salted fish.The service: They clearly hire their waitresses for the kind of body that can fit in a hot pink slinky dress, because that's about all they are good for.  Once our drinks were served, the waitress ignored us for close to an hour while we waited for the appetizer. At this point (yes, after close to an hour), a basket of not super fresh rolls was thrown on the table with a saucer of olive oil.  Service 101: if you make your customers wait for an hour, throw them a bone (I mean some warm rolls) to hold them over. The ambiance: on the trendy side but unmemorable.  There were a lot of guys in suits at dinner on a Sunday night, which was a bit weird, as you just don't see people dressing up for dinner that much any more.Verdict: overpriced and overrated."

/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Seafood in Montreal sucks the bell-end so rating a seafood restaurant here is like comparing public toilets at a festival. Seriously, how may times are we going to see the same shitty sea-bass and tilapia (raised in sewage) slathered in capers and oil to cover up the rot-aroma from it sitting on ice for an entire week? If you're from the southern US, you're going to be sorely disappointed. So, aside from that, which is unavoidable in all Montreal restaurants that serve seafood, I have to say that Ferreira is an elegant spot that runs with Cava and Milos and the rest of them. The ambience is really beautiful - there are lots of heirloom-like knickknacks, lamps, tiled wallwork, glass bar and open counters, etc etc to make the place visually very engaging. The food itself is average to good - nothing on the menu is spectacular, but they sort of do everything well and the decor distracts you into thinking you're experiencing a 5-star meal, which you're totally not. I've had way, and I mean WAY better fish at places like Fogarty's in Key West, and that's a tourist trap in the middle of a tourist street. BUT the overall package is pretty good. A few gripes - mixed meat plates with chorizo, bavette strips, and chicken wings (grand total of $5 of supermarket meat) going for $60 are a bit annoying, as is the waiter waxing poetic about how fresh the sea bass is today (no it's not, the eyes on that fish are clouded over like a muslim cleric in an Al-Qaeda video).Anyways, go try it out. It's definitely pretty."

From a traditional blend of touriga nacional, tinta roriz, touriga franca and the hearty tinta barroca comes a vibrant red with perfect cherry fruit, embellished with caraway, cedar, leather and fennel notes. Medium weight and juicy, with excellent length. Drink now or age five years.  We drank it now and it was very good!!The starter was 4 roasted sardines topped with fleur de sel seated on an olive tapenade and served with toasted bread.  The sardine melted in your mouth, the salt and olive tapenade gave balance and seasoning and the bread provided the host for this tasty treat.My entree was the Black Cod accompanied by a seafood risotto.  Ok, I have never had such a well prepared dish that made me want to order seconds, thirds and a doggy bag!  The fish was cooked to perfection and was topped with a nice parsley garlic puree  The risotto was creamy with ample clams and mussels throughout.   My friends had Cataplana fish and seafood bouillabaisse and seared tuna, smashed potatoes with foie gras --- considering there was no noise except for the constant humm of 3 happy diners I was fully confident their dishes were as good as mine.Thankfully or regrettably there was a second round of bread brought to the table so we all were able to soak up our respective sauces and broth...needless to say no bread remained.Dessert, like we needed it, included a coconut milk tapioca with pineapple marmalade (sooo smooth and creamy) and an order of Portugese vanilla tarts served with a scoop of the most intense coffee ice cream I've had.This was a fabulous meal, outstanding service and a go to restaurant for me whenever I come back into the city!  Thank you Victor for the introduction to a wonderful wine selection!!"

Nothing. She kept serving all the other clients except us. Another thing I disliked was the decor. Since it is a huge place, the modern decor felt very impersonal. The fuchsia light gave it a clubby feel. Plus the AC was on blast! At the end I couldn't wait to leave. On to food. I ordered the grilled calamari, which was kind of bland. My black cod topped with very thin french fries was delicious. I didn't appreciate the black olive in the bottom.

During the warmer seasons they open the restaurant windows so try to snag a seat there as it's the best seat in the house or venture further back into the restaurant for a more intimate setting.

Unfortunately, the restaurant's host wasn't very personable, and the wait staff seemed scattered. At least I found the food to be enjoyable as it got progressively better with each dish...Portuguese-style Oysters (cooked with chorizo, cheese, and tomato sauce) - I usually prefer oysters raw, but thought ""When in Rome..."" After trying the Portuguese-style oysters, I still think they are better raw. The toppings completely overwhelmed the oysters, and all I could taste was salty tomato sauce. The only way I could even tell there was an oyster in there was the slight oceany taste on the finish. Fleur de Sel Roasted Sardines with Tapenade - nicely roasted, plump sardines with just the right amount of salt and olive oil. Simple and appetizing. Porcini-crusted Roasted Black Cod on a Port Reduction and Mashed Potatoes - beautifully cooked piece of cod...perfectly even, super moist, and served at the right temperature. A feat given its enormous size. I expected an earthy flavor from the crust, but couldn't taste the porcini and thought the fish needed a tad more salt. Grilled Giant Tiger Prawns with Tomato Risotto - I'm always a sucker for big, juicy prawns and these did not disappoint. I also loved the tangy tomato risotto. It was delightfully light and vibrant for a risotto. A fantastic pairing with the prawns. Almond Tart with Port-poached Pears - the best part of the meal. This almond tart was AWESOME! I can't remember when I've had an almond tart *this* good. I loved the combination of the brittle crust with the warm, sweet almond filling and the ripe poached pears. The pear sorbet was also a welcome addition and a smooth palate cleanser. Since Ferreira Café boasts the largest collection of ports in North America, I had to get a glass with dessert. I can't remember the name of the port I had, but I recall being pleasantly surprised at how light it was and how well it complemented the almond tart.While the seafood was good at Ferreira Café, I will forever remember it for its amazing almond tart!**For pics of each course, visit my blog linked under my profie.

Vinho verde is usually super cheap, but am happy to have an albarinho. Love albarinho vinho verde. Menu: looks good! Love Portuguese food and fresh seafood. Ordered the salad and GRILLED seafood appetizer for two. Toasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds were left off the salad, but I noticed just in time and the waiter brought them out before we ate. OK, nice save. Good salad with the toasted nuts and a lime vinagrette dressing (I know, I know... not authentic. Portuguese don't eat salad. I liked it anyway!). On to the grilled seafood. So, this is supposed to be served with a butter sauce. It was actually served sizzling in a pan full of oil. Not sure why. It's supposed to be grilled, not fried. I ate it anyway. Mistake. I don't usually eat greasy food. Lost the whole thing shortly after ingesting it. Too much oil. And... that's why I like GRILLED meats and seafood. Oh well. My husband fared much better. He's used to greasy deep fried and pan-fried treats. Disappointed. Everyone else seems to enjoy it more. Sorry, but I won't be back."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was skeptical about trying this restaurant. I like Portuguese food, rustic and no fuss. I did not think you could have a gastronomical meal with Portuguese cuisine. I was wrong... Very wrong. This was a delectable experience on every level. Is it expensive? Yes, about 70/person, no alcohol. Is it worth it? Yes, it's that good. When a restaurant offers such a wide array of fresh fish, it's only normal that the meal is priced accordingly, without mentioning the downtown location.Enough about details... Let's talk about the food.Salmon tartare: fresh, delicious (If I must criticize, chopped a little too coarsely for my taste).Octopus: absolutely delicious. Well balanced and originally garnished. Fried calamari: simple but very good.Black cod: great... Just great.Seafood rice: so tasty and everything was exceptionally fresh. Mixed desserts: wonderful. The service is friendly and impeccable. The restaurant is beautiful. Reservations are strongly recommended.Note: yes, there are good options when it comes to Portuguese dining in Montreal, but no one comes close to Ferreira for quality, freshness, taste and service. Enjoy!"

It saddens me to say that our experience was really the worse we have ever experienced....ever. My younger son was crying when we entered the restaurant and after settling down at our table, I was just about to get up to take him to the bathroom to help him settle down, when the owner came up to our table and said that he could not have a crying child in his restaurant. He said that this is a business restaurant and not a place for children.  He did not give us a chance to soothe my child even after telling him that he is usually very well behaved at restaurants. He then repeated himself and essentially asked us to leave!!!! Of note, we made reservations on Bookenda, and there is an option for # of children. Plus, I contacted the restaurant that morning inquiring about their 3 hour minimum for more than 4 people and my concern that with 3 kids we may not make it to the 3 hours. The person responded that there was no problem and that it was just a suggestion based on what is the usual. So they knew that we had kids and did not tell us that kids were not allowed!! Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a restaurant where we were humiliated and dismissed on our 10 year anniversary. I would not recommend this restaurant for families!!!"

The service was stellar.  Our waiter was there every time we needed him and then some. He was pleasant, attentive, and informative.  The food was original and overly delicious.  The Salmon tartare was so nuanced in flavor.  The super jumbo shrimp was like how lobster should be, great flavor without the richness that makes me feel ill normally.  The black cod porcini was excellent. Definitely not your typical miso butterfish concoction. Everything was unique and so outrageously tasty.  I highly recommend the taster desert platter.

For dessert a tasting for two (enough for four to have a sampling) - so good. Buy the house olive to take home - it is a palate pleaser.

/user_details?userid=xERNrqTL5y1WW5fN4htRBg,Elizabeth F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I absolutely LOVE octopus, especially any kind of grilled octopus. So I am always on the look out for restaurants in Montreal that dare to tackle it. Ferreira's crispy octopus appetizer didn't disappoint. It was so incredibly tender and flavorful. I also had the seafood bouillabaisse which was delicious - or rather, the broth was incredible. The fish and seafood itself was good, but I think the fresh whole fish options would have been the better bet if you are really craving a dish that highlights the fish. I had the chocolate mousse as my dessert. Just as a heads up, the menu for the desserts does not at all do a good job describing what you are getting. I had expected a simple, but intense, mousse. Instead, it was a very complex plate with mousse, ganache, candied preserved lemon, meringue, lemon custurds, a sorbet, and other delights. Absolutely amazing. I will say, that my family ordered the creme brule and the salted caramel, and while they enjoyed it, everyone agreed that the chocolate dish was the star. Overall, it is clear that the restaurant takes great care in its ingredients - many ingredients are flown in from Portugal several times a week. I would definitely recommend it - if you are okay with the price point which is fairly high, but considering the quality it does make sense. Make sure you book ahead, as it fills up very quickly."

I had blood orange mojito to start off which was pretty but was ok, not worth $15 ! I would have ordered wine instead. The appy I ordered grilled calamari and they were yummy chewy and good portioned. 4-5 sizable calamaris. Definitely a good plate to share. The main of course I had to have black cod that everyone is raving about. I sat facing the kitchen and every time I see a black cod shone under the red light (meaning it's ready to be delivered to the table) I hoped that it was for me. The plate is hot so best not to touch it, but boy the cod melts in your mouth. You can dissemble it with your fork and it is too shiny and gorgeous to eat. It's true. and it just glides over your tongue with its flavour.. I forgot what was on the bottom it was some sort of a puree that went with the cod. But I tell you you must try the cod.. Dessert I was so convinced to try their traditional tart. Two little portuguese tart for $10. I am sure it is cheaper in Portugal. But they were cripsy on the outside and soft and eggy creamy inside. You definitely have to open you wallet far and wide here. All including the above the bill came to ~$160 for one person. But service was excellent and the food b y far one of the best meals I had.

What we didn't love, was the lousy service - so when I went back last night, I was hopeful for a better experience. Boy, was I wrong. While the food was good, the service was worse than the first time I went. The manager barely acknowledged us when we arrived, and 'friendly' isn't how I would describe him. He came off as a little arrogant and indifferent. After taking us to our table and asking us if we wanted to check our coats, he left (while our coats sat on a neighbouring table) and never came back. After waiting 10-15 minutes for some kind of acknowledgement, someone finally came by to ask if we wanted to order ; they didn't offer us water, ask if we wanted drinks or even tell us what the daily specials were, if any. Seriously? We told the waiter we'd like a drink which took another 10 minutes to arrive. We then were told that someone new would wait our table. It took at least 20-30 minutes before we were able to order our dishes - and we had to call the girl over twice AND ask for the specials/tell her we were hungry. All the while, there were about 6-7 waiters/waitresses hanging around the bar chatting -some of them looked over once in a while and of course, completely ignored us. My friend and I did notice, however, that the wait staff (including our bad waitress) hovered around the other tables - which lead us to believe that because we LOOK young, the wait staff didn't deem us 'worthy' of their service. Part of the dining out experience is the service - Ferreira failed twice, on this count, and I won't be going back regardless of how good the food might be. For $85, I expect timely service with a smile regardless of how young or old I look - and I shouldn't have to walk around with an open wallet to demonstrate that I can afford to eat there."

It was a recommendation from the concierge at my hotel and fully packed to capacity when I arrived. I was excited by the patronage and despite the crowd, we were seated in minutes. Our waitress was super attentive and our table faced the kitchen. I steadily observed the kitchen staff, dirty plates on the ground and snacking off the food. One person on staff drank a beer, latte and red bull while preparing meals. I had the octopus salad, black cod and a dozen oysters. I was pleased with the octopus salad but disappointed in the black cod. At $40 and with such a flowery menu description, I was ready to be wowed. Unfortunately, perhaps due to a distracted staff, Ferriera just did not deliver on two basics---salt and pepper. It was aesthetically pleasing but very bland. One of my friends had a bone in his fillet and my other guest got the $51 mixed seafood plate with both missing and more bland seafood. Between elements of bland and incomplete plates, I was underwhelmed. The service was great but I'll never eat there again."

Everyone at the table was extremely pleased with their entrees and I especially enjoyed the special of the evening, sea bass with chanterelle mushrooms.

It also came with what was described as a salsa, which could also be described as  a fresh chopped tomato, pepper relish-less saucy and more like a pico de gallo, but seasoned wonderfully.  I also tried the Sardines which were fresh and grilled-very robust, as sardines are and served with a sundried tomato relish, which really rounded out the dish. Also tried the Salt Cod Braz style, which was agreed upon to be described as a hash, with a stunning presentation.  It was very rich, but wonderful. The Grilled Angus reserve rib eye, truffle puree, red wine, was hands down, one of the best pieces of beef I've had in recent memory and the truffled mashed potatoes were delicious.  It was also served with a bone full of marrow which we spread on some bread.  For dessert, the Natas were a must have -small vanilla custard in pastry shells with a dusting of cinnamon, and were served with a small scoop of caramel ice cream. A perfect combination with the strong and satisfying Portuguese espresso.  The wine list was all Portuguese wines, which we weren' familiar with, but our server who was spectacular, recommended a beautiful earthy red, and a nice dry glass of white. I apologize for not keeping track of the names.A great experience in an amazing food mecca.  A little pricey, but I will surely be back next time I'm in Montreal."

Finally, we ordered a bottle of red wine to accompany some of our diners meals and it arrived very cold even for a cellars temp.  We asked the server if we could decant the wine to help with this, and it took three reminders.  After that the experience went uphill.  This rant is to hopefully a someone who can encourage the staff here that humans are inanely good and you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.   Will change the star rating up a bit for recipe of lamb dry rub, if someone cares to respond.

We were visiting on business, and were very much looking forward to dinner at this restaurant on our last evening in Montreal -- billed as the best Portuguese food outside Portugal. My wife had the squash soup with crab as a starter. It was watery and fishy, but OK. She ordered the fresh grilled sea bass, which came with different accompaniments than described. It was so salty it was barely edible. I skipped a starter and ordered the evening's surf and turf, a broiled half lobster and veal chop. The chop was excellent, but the lobster was dry and tasteless. Both were very salty. All-in-all, the food was mediocre at best.The menu and the food came relatively quickly, but then the service deteriorated dramatically. We had to ask for bread, which appeared to be routinely served to other tables. The waiter never inquired about our food. After an eternity, he appeared from nowhere, and without a word brusquely grabbed our empty plates and disappeared again. He finally dropped desert menus on the table while running by. At this point, we were so disappointed in the food and the ever slower service that we decided to pass and asked for the check -- which took what seemed a lifetime to arrive and even longer to pay. Not once did the server ask if we enjoyed our meal (no!) or thank us for our patronage. This was a very expensive meal -- around $150 for one glass of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees (admittedly, the surf and turf was expensive at $65). But I expected a lot more."

This was a classic seafood dish done right.  The ingredients were fresh and the medley of fish, shellfish, vegetables and broth were sublime.  The seafood was tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The broth was the best part.  It was rich in taste and complemented the ingredients so well. It's been a few months since I had that dish and I can still taste it.The service was great both times. The sommelier picked a nice crisp white to go with both our dishes (I unfortunately can't remember the name).  The hostess and the wait staff were attentive and nice.  The ambiance provides low lighting for a romantic dinner.  The space isn't too big so feels more intimate, but it can get a little too close for comfort when it's a friday or saturday night - their busiest nights - and you're almost sitting with the couple at the next table.  But overall we love ferreira cafe.

We enjoyed as main course Dover Sole that melted in your mouth and three different paella variations one consisting of Duck confit, clams,shrimps,lobster,black cod,in a broth made simply with their own juices. The black cod with its edgy finish was in a league of its own with a flakiness that rivaled Chilean Sea Bass.We finished the evening sharing a chocolate fondue and vanilla bean ice cream that made the evening unforgettable.

/user_details?userid=QYRZsFz3V89AFNqN-b_-4g,charlene c.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"The food was excellent. We had the sampler platter of calamari, quail, sardines and chouriço to start, then porcini crusted cod and seabass as the main courses. They were all delicious except we had to wait 65 minutes from the time we ordered until the starter arrived. Apparently, something went wrong in the kitchen and the waiter informed us it would take longer casually without an apology. The wine was disappointing and overpriced. Because we had sat there for so long waiting for our food, we decided to leave after our main courses, walk around a bit and take a dessert somewhere else. The waiter responded with a tone of disbelief when we told him we would not have dessert. The food definitely deserves 5 stars, but factoring in the poor service and overpriced wine, I can only give this place a 3."

/user_details?userid=_BwqgDlfyeS3kkCGsJzMog,vivian y.,"Mountain View, CA",4 star rating,"went here today after two people who live in montreal recommended. this is the first place we hit up on our trip. asked mirelle at the w hotel concierge for a RSVP and they squeezed us in at 2 pm. it was packed - mostly a business crowd. we ended up staying for 2 hours and took our time with lunch. hostess was very nice and she seated us right next to the window. server was attentive, however, it did take him some time to fill my water glass throughout lunch. he had no qualms about speaking in english either - thank goodness. seemed like definitely the place to be for lunch. the hubs ordered the soup of the day (vegetable soup) and the the tomato/parmasean salad. he enjoyed both very much. he said the soup had a kick to it. i ordered the appetizer of the day - this potato salad proscuitto w/ vinaigrette thingy. sorry, that's what i remember. there is something about the tomatoes here in montreal, they are so fresh and tasty. for the entree, i got the fish bouillabaisse and that was perfect for a gloomy afternoon. not too heavy or creamy - just the way i like it. the portion was very generous. definitely need to enjoy seafood to come here...poor hubs since he is not a seafood eater. almost everything on the menu is fish something. we finished off lunch with the vanilla creme brûlée and coffee. fyi, they don't serve decaf (or ice tea or lemonade). for the both of us, it was only $60 before tip - completely reasonable for a nice lunch. remember there are two doors to the restaurant. you want the first door, the second takes you upstairs for a private event space i think. would love to come back to try the other items on the menu. rue peel is right off of the main shopping street - rue st. catherine. about 15-20 min walk from the montreal."
