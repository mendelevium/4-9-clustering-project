/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really love this place! I've been here 5 or 6 times and the Fish and Chips are consistently delicious. They have several different types of fish to choose from, each with its own tasty batter. I prefer the classic Cod with beer batter but the Haddock with maple syrup batter is also quite good. I had lunch here a couple of times pre-COVID and both visits were great: friendly and fast service, a cool British inspired interior (sort of a cross between a pub and one of those stand up takeout joints in London), a small but excellent selection of English beers, and piping hot fish and chips. Yum!The portion sizes are huge consisting of two good size portions of fish on top of a mountain of fresh fries. These days are takeout only and the takeaway packaging is excellent: my servings have all been hot and fresh even when walking home in the middle of winter. I would go out of my way to have lunch here, swing by and give it a try!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My friends and I were in the area and decided to stop here for lunch. We ordered Cod with a side of Chips, Salmon with a side of Chips and Poutine to share between the 3 of us!! We could have ordered one less meal and still have plenty to eat!! The servings are HUGE. The fish tasted excellent and was very fresh! In love with this place and would recommend to anyone looking for a generic Brit & Chips experience!"
/user_details?userid=xYkM7ONAOqoHZ_WPQkqj6Q,Sebastien L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Pretty good overall great fish and chips (fries) but the chips were to my taste at least kinda overcooked and they were too much also the batter was kinda too sweet for my taste  even thought I genrally have a big sweet tooth (I took the Haddock with maple batter)Staff was super sweet and helpful and we didn't too long before getting our food and they're really careful too on special request as I'm allergic to Shrimps I asked them to be careful to not make it in contact with my food and they  took it in consideration .I also forgot to mention that every employees were wearing a mask and we had to wait like 2 minutes the time they clean the table people used before us good job for real guys ;)So I definitely recommende this restaurant if you come to Montreal

We wanted to take a look inside and see how crowded it was, and check the menu and prices, before deciding if we want to eat here or go elsewhere. The second we walked in the door, an employee yelled from all the way across the room, ""for here or to go?"" I did not want to shout across the room, so I held up one finger trying to indicate give me one minute to decide if I even wanted to stay here. She repeated even more loudly, demanding ""FOR HERE OR TO GO?"". The restaurant was very crowded and very noisy, so I walked across the room to the staff member, since I don't shout across rooms. I told her we wanted to check the menu first, but I would start with a beer at the bar. She said ""You have to buy food."" I didn't like her tone and said ""We might, or we might just get drinks."" She rudely said ""You're not allowed to get a beer and just sit here without ordering food."" I have never encountered this rule in my life and it annoyed me. I said ""fine"" and got the smallest appetizer to go and took it outside to eat. The food was quite tasty so I actually might go here again."
/user_details?userid=MXk6eNh_8rwOcB27GNXgmw,Angela L.,"Blacklick, OH",5 star rating,"Syrup battered haddock...enough said.Seriously though, this place was delish. Quaint and definitely busy around lunch, the service is great, the food is served piping hot, and the atmosphere is pleasant. The flavor of the maple syrup mixed with the batter is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor of the fish but gives a nice sweet enhancement. The fries are hot and crispy too!"
/user_details?userid=DRxt228GYEkzoRFhGWdiig,Kristen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Poutines and popcorn shrimp?!? I'm in heaven. This was my first stop when I landed in Montreal- gotta get those poutines!... To top it off why not a unique version of poutines with popcorn shrimp?! Yes please! The poutines alone are great. Super large chunks of cheese and a great mild gravy - not too salty or over powering. The fries are super thick cut and homemade which makes everything alone great, but put them together is perfection! The shrimp is also super crispy, but not too greasy. It was probably one of my favorite popcorn shrimps. The sea food tasted fresh and you can tell it was battered in house. It wasn't a weird taste eating the shrimp and poutines together either. It was a great way to spend the first rainy day in Montreal! Staff is super friendly and too !"
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"We found Brit & Chips whilst wandering downtown Montreal looking for a spot that was low-key and open after 9pm. Food: We had the cod and chips, sausage roll, popcorn shrimp, and a scotch egg. Cod had a nice batter and was perfectly cooked on the inside. Chips were just right. The sausage roll had a good flavor to it, but we weren't expecting that to be deep fried too as we've typically had baked sausage rolls. Popcorn shrimp was a little over cooked, but that could have been due to the paprika that coated it. Scotch egg came with a tasty chutney. Service: For take out orders, it's counter style ordering. For eat in, they have table service. Friendly and efficient, our server was also cook and cashier. Cost: Two cod and chips, one sausage roll, one scotch egg, popcorn shrimp and two sodas ran us about CAD$55.Overall: Great for the occasional deep fried goodness. They even have deep fried desserts! Clean with friendly service. Cash and cards accepted. And they are open past 9pm."

I brought my friend for the first time and she LOVED it! She's a huge foodie so i knew she'd appreciate this place!  (They even have a mini terrasse for the summer)The staff is very friendly and the price is really good for the quality and quantity you get for a meal.The fish is cooked just right, with just enough fried batter without having oil leaking everywhere.The tartar sauce is made in house with good a balance of lemon and sweet radish. We both took the 14$ combo (fish and chip+drink).I took the maple syrup Haddock, which was amazing. The taste of the maple syrup wasn't over powering and wasn't too sweet.We also took the Tandoori popcorn shrimp. Now I'm not the biggest fan of Tandoori but it was pretty good. We couldn't even finish the fries we were so stuffed! Highly recommend going here!One of my favourite places for fish and chips!"

I've seen many great reviews and decided to stop by after I landed in MTL. All I can say is what a great way to start my trip here.The place itself was small inside, vintage/old style, narrow restaurant and packed with people.The food was amazing, probably the best fish and chips I've ever had: doesn't compare to any of the fish and chips I've had in Toronto. I got the orange crush batter fish and tried the original cod with chips. The chips were super crispy and tasty. The cod seasoning was super yummy and the orange crush battered fish was perfect. It had a light seasoning (slight taste of the orange) and not oily at all; other places make it really oily, something I've always disliked with other fish and chips places. I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back here when I visit again."
/user_details?userid=TCcQd4C_nZAlKIfPJQwlIw,Omar S.,"Birmingham, AL",4 star rating,"I am not much of a fish and chips fan mostly because many fish and chips are COD (which I am not much of a fan of). As such, I rarely frequent ""strictly"" fish and chips restaurants. However, I decided to try a fish and chips restaurant nearby my hotel (on my first night in Montreal). This restaurant actually had several selections of fish for fish and chips, which was nice to see. I ordered the salmon fish and chips. This was my first time having fried salmon. The fish was well seasoned (yes I could still taste the seasoning in or with the batter), fried well, and the chips (fries) were good as well. In addition to the chips, I ordered the baked beans. The baked beans were not good at all. Baked beans should at least be average when served at any type of fish fry restaurant. This is the only reason why I did not award 5 stars. When the server asked, ""how was everything?""....I stated that I enjoyed everything except the baked beans. The server voluntarily offered to take the baked beans off the bill (which was very kind). The servers were friendly and responsive, AND the restaurant plays really nice music."

/user_details?userid=pu2YKTbOBBy45iL-SqlRRg,Letticia C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Coming to Montreal for a holiday? I'm sure smoked meats and poutine are on your list. However, Brit and Chips should definitely make that list as well. Located in Old Montreal, it's perfect pit stop among the attractions in the area. This is described as a québécois twist on the classic fish and chips. There's a perfect deal for $14 for a set meal of a soft drink, fish and chips. My friend and I got the cod and the haddock. The cod is the classic and most popular kind while the haddock has the maple batter, which made it a unique fish that's sweet and salty. This is legitimately one of the most flavourful and flakey fish and chips I've had in my life. The fish was soft but the batter was crispy. The chips are also crispy and a perfect match to the fish. Do yourself a favour and give it a try!"

/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're looking for decent fish and chips in Montreal, you can't go wrong with this place. So granted the fish isn't comparable to the best ones in London, but it will definitely satisfy your fish cravings. I've been here twice and the quality of the food is consistent. They have a few choices of fishes and I always take the cod. The batter is a bit sweet, but overall very tasty and crunchy. The fish is fresh and tender. And the tartar sauce is SO good! Would come back for casual lunch or dinner."
/user_details?userid=AM3SSYqgob97Q6MBw22Y-g,Shan C.,"Montclair, NJ",4 star rating,Good fish fries with good spice. They used different batter for each individual fish. The combo is a very good deal that includes a 12oz drink.

I saw great reviews on this place and decided to visit. We got there about 45 minutes before closing and the place was practically empty. Our server was very friendly and efficient. Menu had fish and chip combos for about $13-15. There is also a combo with fish and chips, and a beer for about $16-18, which is a great deal. We got the Salmon and chips and a side of fried shrimp. Food came out super fast in about 10-15 minutes. The food was very good. I was worried, as with most places, that the batter would take up most of the fish, but the batter was thin and crunchy enough a sufficient amount of fish. The fries were average. The shrimp was good. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal."

/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Delicious friend food, lightning fast service, overall a must try!A small, casual diner-style restaurant with a patio and an open kitchen. We came early in the evening when wasn't very packed. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food seriously came out so quickly, probably within 5 minutes of us ordering!We tried:1. Fried salmon with Murphy's Stout batter - delicious and fatty without feeling overly greasy. I do think salmon overall isn't the best choice for fried fish, as the flavor gets a little lost with the batter and should be enjoyed alone. I think white fish lends itself better to being fried, but just a personal opinion2. Fried haddock with maple syrup batter - A real highlight. You could taste a hint of sweetness of the maple syrup3. Shrimp salad - little shrimps tossed in a bed of lettuce. A nice refreshing way to start the meal before digging into the heavier fried foods. Pretty standard, not a stand-out; I would probably stick to the fried options that this place is great at. 4. Fries - Hearty and crispy. Really good fries!We would come back again and again to try other options among the fish and the appetizers, and if we lived here this would definitely be a staple choice. Definitely worth coming to, doubly if you're a fan of fried foods!--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"

Price is good and portions are more than average. Loved the shrimp salad! Service is quick, staff is friendly enough. The only negative point I will give is that we went there in the evening before the closing time on a weekend but they were closing earlier than what was written on Google map. So we did feel rushed but the staff was still kind to let us order."
/user_details?userid=IKSmm5MzHF8cMhMolKaIOw,Lorenzo L.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"So what do you do when you are visiting Montreal for the first time and you are hungry since you haven't eaten lunch? Try to find a lunch place is what you do. The weapon of choice is the Yelp app, of course. This place was not our first choice. The place we chose was closed for lunch service so we stumbled to Brit & Chips as it was within walking distance from where we were. I didn't know anything about this place beforehand nor did I bookmarked this place on Yelp. When my Yelp friends started commenting about the different batters, I realize what was the specialty of this place. They use different batters for their fish using local styles and flavours. The place is not very big and seating and space is limited. There's only one big table for a group at the back and two people tables alongside. The rest of the seats are located in the bar like setup. My wife, daughter and I decided to go for the $14 combo of fish, chips and a soft drink. There's a $18.50 combo with fish, chips and a burgundy light ale. My wife and daughter chose the Cod with the burgundy batter while I went for the Haddock with the maple syrup batter. I loved my fish along with the fries. The batter was crispy while the fish inside was tender. I loved the Tartar sauce too. However, my wife and daughter were not impressed with their fish, but all 3 of us agreed that their chips were one of the best we had. Service was minimal but efficient. Once you are done, go to the front to pay. I wish Toronto had a place like this. Highly recommended!"

This is not traditional fish & chips - we have our chips fatter and yellower than this, and we don't put maple syrup in our batter - but I don't care, this was amazing.It's a little heavy on the old ""Rule Britannia"" theming but, eh, I'll let it slide.

/user_details?userid=0cHEkFahUqJiobK3vo8BbA,Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",5 star rating,"Brit & Chips is a right proper chippie that does fish and chips right, serving up one of the best versions of the British classic that I've ever had (including in the British isles).Aa this was my first visit, I had to go with the classic, having the cod that was dipped and perfectly deep-fried in a Burgundy batter. The cod had a wonderful creamy texture, and the batter made for a crisp, flavorful crunch. Despite being deep-fried, the fish wasn't greasy, and that's a sign that the folks at the fryer know what they're doing. The chips were hot and plentiful, the mushy peas were on-point, and the Burgundy Lion ale was the perfect complement, making for a great, low-key dinner. Brit & Chips offers various types of fish, as well as pasties, meat pies, and Irn Bru for Brits longing for a beverage from the other side of The Pond. Perfect fish and chips, a great pint, and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours playing in the background... pretty damn great!BTW, you can check Brit & Chips out on Food Network Canada's site, as they were featured on YGEH!

I tried the cod with burgundy batter which was delicious. Huge portions though. I could not finish the fish or fries. I wouldn't recommend subsisting the chips for poutine, unless you have a big appetite. Service was pretty good and fast. Who doesn't like happy faces! Yay! Another spot - added to the fav list!"

Service is great, and they have a variety of fish and batter to choose from.  They even have a version using Halloumi cheese for vegetarians!! We tried a few varieties (the waitress let us know that we can get one fillet as a half order).  Batter wise, I like the Sour Cream 'n Onion the best.  Burgandy is nice too, but while the maple syrup one is very popular, I don't really like the sweetness of it.  As for the fish, we prefer the firmer texture of cod and haddock over the sole.  That said, we did enjoy everything."

This restaurant offers very interesting batter flavors and many kinds of fish. The food is fresh out of the fyer, portions are generous and prices affordable. The creamy dips are also delicious, both for the fish and the fries. If eating too much fried food makes you feel sluggish/stuffy, you can try adding lemon juice or vinegar (it helps a bit). Apart from the fish, we also tried their Tandoori Popcorn Shrimp, which was good, but nothing special. I recommend trying their Ben Shaws sodas - again, they have interesting flavors, such as Dandelion&Burdock and Bitter Shandy.Really happy they added a location on Maisonneuve!"

My husband had the haddock & chips, and curry sauce. The fish batter was nothing special. The fish was good and flakey. The mushy peas were the highlight. The fries were nothing special. The curry sauce was good but not with anything on the menu. We took the curry sauce home to eat with something later. If you want deep fried food this probably the place to go. Not my favorite."

It's a 5 I say! A FIVE. We stopped in for a bite before heading to BotaBota and it was all because I had a fish & chips craving from earlier in the week that had yet to be satisfied. My poor victim of a guest is NOT a fish and chips person whatsoever and told me as we were waiting that they had literally never had an enjoyable fish and chips meal.We grabbed a seat on the terrace and took advantage of the $18.50 for a full fish & chips + a pinte. We ordered the Salmon (stout batter) and the Cod (beer batter). The service was relatively quick and efficient in ensuring we were enjoying our meal. OH BOY WERE WE. We split the two dishes so we could taste some of both. The Cod plate was honestly what most higher end restaurants would aim for if they had fish on their menu. Very moist, thicker but light batter, and of course, perfection in the form of potatoes. Every bite was perfect in taste and texture. There was no excess oil, burnt corners or the usual slew of crap in the batter or frozen fish to be seen. This was the real deal. Then to make the meal even better, I had my first bite of the Salmon. The fish itself was perfectly moist, flavorful and wrapped delicately in a thinner layer of a thicker (stout beer) batter. It was too good. Literally, now I'm mad I haven't been going since its farther from home.Honestly, that Salmon Stout dish... The Keg would be lucky if their chef's could regularly put out a fish and chips dish at that level. And they CERTAINLY wouldn't be doing it for under $14.In classic British form, the shop's front window gives you a view to the ""kitchen"" (open). You can see for yourself not only how fresh everything is, but how clean and well managed it is. I love that they have seating that overlooks the direction of the kitchen for when you're here solo. I'll definitely be back in the next 10 days to try their ""of the month"" which in September 2017 is JERK. I can't wait!"

This part of town looks as if it recently came into some money, so it has a more posh exterior than the rest of Montreal, and while it lacks that North American Euro anytown look and feel so pervasive in the rest of the city, I kind of like it. It's clean, well maintained, and pretty quiet.But, enough about that...onto the food! The fish was fried expertly, with a crisp finish and flaky interior. The chips were fat, plump and greased up just so to give off that perfect glisten. I had the poisson du mois, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. This particular mois featured a sole with jerk batter that gave the fish a wee bit of kick.I also love the origin story of the place that is on the menu, on the wall, and even on the paper in the basket, below the fish and chips."

We had(and shared) the cod(burgundy batter), haddock(maple syrup batter), and the sole(sour cream and onion batter). It was all AMAZING! Everyone said their favorite was the one they ordered. I had the maple syrup batter and it was wonderful! Not only are the batters delicious, but the fish is cooked to perfection! The tartar sauce is a great compliment to the dish as well! There is a good amount of seating with a couple tables inside and out and good bar space inside. We finished our meal with a fried 'whatever' which we chose kit kat and werent disappointed! Brit and Chips is a must for Montreal visits!"

The inside transform you into a whole other place and the music they have playing is enough to get you to stay a while and hang. Their menu is simple, fish and chips, so you know they're doing something right. My husband and I had the classic but they do put a twist on their batter, which is a nice touch. The fish came out hot and fresh, and the batter was perfect. My husband had authentic fish and chips in London last year and he said on a scale of 1-10 these were an 8 in his book. Can't get much closer on his scale. They have a great selection of local brews, the cider was my favorite. Decently priced food, great portions and an awesome vibe. Authentic England in the heart of Montreal, what more could you ask for."

/user_details?userid=PK7nySYMd0_Xb53324SBQQ,Long K.,"Bellevue, WA",4 star rating,"British fish and chips in a predominantly French Canadian province! The name of the place is pretty simple and self-explanatory.HADDOCK (maple syrup batter) - Acts like a slightly sweet batter. The maple flavor gets lost a bit in the fried grease.SOLE (sour cream and onion batter) - WOW. If you have a weakness for sour cream and onion junk food, then GET THIS. You get the flavor immediately on the first bite.Hake (orange crush batter) - One of the most curious types of batter out of the selection. We opted for the half portion ($6) to try this out which was the right choice over the full portion. The flavor is only mildly sweet won't the most bare flavor of orange soda present.Shrimp Scampi Salad - The shrimp is flavored with herbs and abundant throughout the salad. The salad itself isn't too special. It's not like you have a decent amount of other options if don't want the chips portion with your fish order. Speaking of the chips, they're decent also with a bit of salt.Overall a good change up of cuisine located in Old Montreal. This place won't break your tourist wallet and prices are super cheap for fish. Everything is fried crispy, and well portioned, definitely recommend (if you're tired of poutine)."

I told my husband I really felt like some ""chips"" so he got me a bag of Lays originals :/ After making it clear that chips in the UK = fat fries/potatoes, that evening, after a little research, he discovered Brit and Chips. We went for a small walk, not too far by the old port and as soon as we were unable to bear the cold, rushed to this very cute and cosy restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to see the traditional 'chippy' interior with the metal counters and deep fryers exactly as if it were in the UK! We had amazing cod fish fried in tasty batter and the chips tasted as if I was having them back home... I was in heaven! I couldn't even believe that just like the chippies in Scotland, they even did deep fried chocolate bars! My husband was just too curious and ordered a snickers one. It was delicious!I love how they have put a twist to the traditional British chippy by giving it a local touch.. By introducing various batter flavours (such as maple syrup) different deep fried chocolates than the original Mars bars and adding sauces. There is a lot of choice but you can even go there for a good old British cuppa! They also do the famous '99' Ice cream which I cannot wait to try out in Summer! Overall we both loved this place and I will probably be back there soon when I am feeling homesick! :)"

Everything was AMAZING! The maple syrup batter was to die for, and the haddock was moist and flaky. Chips were fantastic, especially with some malt vinegar drizzled on top.

The fish here is always fresh & flaky. Chips are really good. Not too greasy. They have a few English as well as French beer's. Their Pie's are good too.

I was disappointed by the sole with the sour cream and onion batter. The quality of the ingredients from Brit & Chips were questionable. I was overwhelmed by the grease and underwhelmed by the lack of freshness of the fish. The sole was also overcooked. The chips were slightly soft and not as crispy as fries could be.On a more positive note, the waitress was very hospitable.

Brit atmosphere is complete with Beatles music in the background.Nice menu variety, was surprised to see tandoori popcorn shrimps so I wanted to try that immediately and it was delicious. I ordered sour cream and onion batter sole and my friend got the maple syrup haddock - both were very tasty and cooked well, however the batter was thicker on mine. Crispy on the outside, moist inside.Fries were thick cut, not too soggy. Simple ingredients that turn into savoury satisfaction! If you're still feeling for some greasy goodness, I dare you to try their deep fried dessert ;)I'm also digging their British Ben Shaws soda, I drank up the ""cloudy lemonade"" which is a perfect balance of sweet and sour that got my taste buds tingling.  I'll be back for more and I'm making sure to tell everyone!"

Of course, fish n chips aren't just the only things worth trying out at Brit & Chips. You'd be missing out if you didn't try the imported Ben Shaws soft drink. I don't think that there are many places in Montréal offering these drinks. If you like cream soda then you should absolutely try Ben Shaws' because it just puts any cream soda to shame. As for desserts, I had a deep-fried Wunderbar chocolate bar which was somewhat excessive but it was surprisingly good! The melting chocolate and caramel concoction is held together with bits of peanut in the center by which everything is inside a layer of crunchy batter. So good! Definitely worth trying."

I grew up on Fish and Chips in the UK and this is by far the best fish and chips place I've found in 20 years living in North America and I've tried hundreds. Okay it helps that the owners came from England and being the best was their strategy but it's not often people actually achieve it. Brit and Chips has. Straight away you notice that it's set up like a proper f&c shop, long order counter, long bar table with stools and an area with grouped table and chairs. The restaurant is spotlessly clean; not even salt spills on the counters. That speaks volumes about their approach to business and food. There's a superb selection of fish, each served with a unique batter, designed to enhance the fishes own natural flavor but you can opt out of that if you're insistent. There's pies, pasties and some nice shrimp/scampi salads. The fish frying is done to perfection. No greasy, oily residue just piping hot fish and soft crispy batter. The two separate easily and the fish remains firm yet easily flakes - just as it should be. The chip frying is unfortunately more haphazard. Twice the potatoes were golden brown, third time dark brown and fourth so dark and blackened ends that we sent them back. Was really surprised but we were told that other customers had ordered them like that. Well not us!  The menu also includes traditional chip shop items you just don't find in the USA - scotch eggs, pickled onions and mushy peas. All wonderful in their own strange way and a true taste of Blighty. Fish review:Cod and burgundy batter. So good, so much like a taste of merry old England and a wonderful example to anyone of how fish can be prepared and fried. It had all the right notes to take me mentally back years and if you're trying fish and chips for the first time this is the one for you. Haddock with maple syrup batter. By far the stand out for me. I have an adventurous side and this speaks to that. A lot of English and a little of Montreal. If they did exports I'd buy the batter by the pint. It's subtle but beautiful. Adds a slight sweetness which enhances the truly fresh, firm fish. It's a combination that is just heavenly. Loved picking this up when it was so hot that it hurts your fingers but it feels so good in your mouth.Hake and orange crush. An underrated fish in my opinion which is greatly enhanced by expert prep and a good batter. Brilliantly done, elevated this fish to a new level. If you're a fan of f&c or trying it as an alternative to the spring fast food you can't go wrong. My favorite fish and chip shop in North America by miles."

Surprisingly it worked out as the restaurant was only a 5 minute walk from my girlfriends workplace!The place is really cute, from the outside it look like a classy pub, but when you walk in it has this old school British diner-like look to it. We sat down and picked the normal cod, a sausage roll and by recommendation the haddock with maple batter. The waitress was even nice enough to recommend that we only get one of the battered fish with chips and not both as the portion of french fries is very large. The sausage roll was crispy and warm and paired with the dijon mustard was great. The fish was on another planet; the batter was flaky, the fish was warm and fell apart without the use of a knife, just how it should be. The tartar sauce was also incredible. Overall just an amazing plate of fish and chips at a really nice and cozy restaurant. Both of us ate for less than 30$, so the pricing was very reasonable and worth every dollar!"

As someone who has been to the UK and had a fair share of fish and chips while there, I can say without a doubt that Brit & Chips does the classic staple justice on many fronts.I decided to go with the standard choice of cod coated in a Burgundy batter with chips as well as a pint of Burgundy Lion on the side. Brought out steaming hot and fresh from the fryer and served on newspaper, I was salivating in anticipation and excitement, and it did not disappoint. The fish was fried to a perfect crisp, even to the point where I could hear the crunch after biting into it. It was also juicy and went along amazingly with the tartar sauce and lemon, creating a savory, creamy, and tangy experience all in one bite. The chips were cut into decently thick slices and were soft but not soggy and maintained an edge to that differentiated them from your typical fries. The Burgundy Lion beer complemented the fish very nicely and I could actually stomach tasting it unlike most beers, and I could see myself drinking it voluntarily on a regular basis (not trying to sound like an alcoholic or anything).I have also been to Comptoir 21 for fish and chips, but I have to say that Brit & Chips wins the battle hands down. The offerings overall stay way more true to what you would actually get in the UK, and it shows in the quality of the food and drinks. I would definitely come back here again with friends so I can spread the love for this place and make it more known because that's what it most definitely deserves."

/user_details?userid=YuiHy5G_2y_GB3_iHeJToQ,Paula S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent chippie! Wasn't sure what to expect from the maple battered haddock but was pleasantly surprised.  The maple flavor was very subtle and didn't detract from the mildness of the fish.  The quality of fish was impressive my haddock fillet was fresh and meaty.  We especially enjoyed the chips--it's hard to find proper chips outside of Britain but these came very close.  The Mystique cider is excellent and well  worth trying.  Portion sizes are reasonable and service was friendly and attentive.

No matter where you go in North America I feel like I am always served fish and fries instead of a proper chip. Then I found Brit n chips in Montreal!I've been there a few times but only got round to reviewing it after my visit today. I went in at lunch time and the place was packed but staff still said hello to me and service was super speedy. On this occasion I ordered a portion of cod and chips and a portion of salmon and chips. I also had a side of mushy peas which are pretty authentic and true to what you'd find in good old Blighty. The fish is always cooked expertly and the variety of batters on offer is excellent. For instance, my salmon was cooked in a Guiness batter. As for the chips they are actual chips and not fries. They are lightly salted by the staff after cooking and served in faux newspaper which is a very nice touch. Tartar sauce and lemon comes included with the meal but you can ask for extra if needed.Overall I couldn't speak highly enough of this excellent tribute to fine British cuisine!"

We really had no business eating another lunch but we were there to bust a gut and decided a highly rated fish n chips joint was too tempting to pass up.For the fish choices, they had cod, haddock, salmon, hake & sole. We shared the haddock which came with nigh perfect crinkle cut fries. The fish was moist, had a thin crispy batter and tasted great once we added the malt vinegar, lemon or tartar sauce. Slightly disappointing was the portion size of the fish. There was one medium sized fillet and two small ones - not like the large sized fillets you get when you order fish n chips in England... but I'm usually of the mindset that taste triumphs all, so it was all good. To wash down the food, I got the Burgundy Lion Ale which is the only beer they had on draft. It was a crisp beer that went well with the dish and the best part was you could get half a pint for $3.50. Fish+chips+a pint of beer=$24 all in. Now that's an equation that would make me a happy customer any day of the week, especially when the food is tasty like it was at Brit & Chips."

I would've like to seen more selections like fried salmon, fried etc and what's the point of having a British chip place if the staff are not British?It was actually mostly French waiters which killed the theme of the place for me.

I mean, what's the point of sweating my a$$ off doing Power yoga if I can't treat myself to some deep-fried goodness after? I ordered the Haddock, which was deep-fried in a maple syrup batter. It was deeeeee-licious! I was a little worried that the maple syrup would cause the batter to be too sweet but the truth is that I barely tasted it. In fact, if I didn't specifically know that there was maple syrup in there, I'd never have guessed. NOW: the fish was so very flaky and moist and well, perfect. The batter was plentiful, yet light and crispy. The whole damn concoction was simply amazing and, in my opinion, the ratio of fish to batter (or vice versa) was perfect. Bonus? The homemade tartar sauce had a nice little bite to it as well. Tasty.  As for the chips - well, this is a huge compliment where I come from: they reminded me of the ones my mum makes at home. Nice and thick, golden and not too fried, and thus, not at all oily or greasy. I'm not an expert but these fries were not cooked in week-old oil. Or maybe they were and they're just really good at hiding it. Who knows? In any case, the lot (fish, chips and all) were served upon newspaper, in a pie plate. I finished off the night with a .99 cone topped with one of my favorites: Flake. Noms.The restaurant itself is small, but they do have a terrace that you can enjoy as long as you don't mind the pedestrian traffic.

What this place has over other spots is the variety of different types of fish and batters they offer their clients. When I go, I usually go with the cod or haddock but I am told that the Sole and the Salmon are amazing. The chips too, I must say, are great.You can get beer or wine but I usually find that I am WAYYYYY too bloated after if I grab a brew or two so I usually stick to water. So heavy. So greasy. So good.

The service is good and they are usually always pacted at this small place in Old port.

Prices are reasonable for the portions. Apart from tandoori shrimps, the accompaniments are disappointing. Always tried fish and chips so can't comment on the pies or anything else. Beers are a fun selection.

/user_details?userid=1jIAYlNaI9ZhGNOnmeblyA,Moon L.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I went to Brits & Chips with two English friends for dinner (after PyCon 2014- python conference) and all of us loved the food. I was surprised that both fish and fries (chips) here were not greasy in comparison to many of fried food I had in US (fries also had more potato content than many other empty just crispy fries). I had gluten-free hake with chips, and I enjoyed the whole experience. Though I don't have any basis for comparison, because this is my first official fish & chips (and definitely first gluten-free version). For me one of the most important thing about fried food is whether I feel well after because I have a pretty sensitive stomach. I feel pretty sick soon after having fried food at places that presumably use bad quality oil (or continuously re-use oil which is supposedly bad). I had no problem with food here. All the fried food was timely fried, just right between chewy and crispy outside, and rich with actual fish or potato inside, so I could actually appreciate simple taste of fish and potato as food, not just something overpowered by and oozing with grease (which unfortunately happens at many places). One of us got Haddock which was fried in Maple Syrup Batter which he said was amazing (and he's English and would know good taste of fish & chips way better than I do =)).It's a small, quite interesting place; I've simply never been to a place like this in US or elsewhere. It's hard to describe but there are two super close narrow, long high tables facing opposite directions (you'll be super- and really mean this- close to person sitting on the other side) and several sit down tables at the back. 3 of us sat at normally 2 ppl table in the back, which was comfortable. (3 or less seems like the right group size for this place). Our server was friendly and helpful with our questions. I'm totally biased here, but  this was one of the most memorable and enjoyable food & experience I had in Montreal (perhaps one of my favorite comfort food ever, and one of my favorite fries. the way 'chips' are cut compared to fries, it is more potato-ey and just tastes better IMHO- found this way more tasty than poutine), something I'll truly miss when I return to SF."

I'm glad he did.This was the first thing I actually liked eating in Montreal and it was British food! We got the haddock (maple syrup batter) after the very friendly and helpful waitress recommended it. All the prices at brit & chips were really reasonable, even for drinks which I got an awesome cider.Haddock wase perfectly crispy and fresh tasting and with a little lemon squeezed on it, sooo good. I tried to eat slow to savor it, but I couldn't.  Almost considered ordering another one, but we had fried twix we desert on the way.  That was really really good too.  We were super full and we don't ever really eat unhealthily, but I loveddddd everything we ate there. Definitely a place to check out in Montreal."

I found Brit & Chips located in proximity to metro Square Victoria. My partner and I ordered each 2 different kinds of fish to share. We ordered the salmon battered with Guiness and we ordered a hake battered with Orange crush... They were both very good. For appetizer we had battered shrimps that were very yummy and the fact that I enjoyed them even shocks me because I normally don't like seafood. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that enjoys fish and Chips.... They have several interesting dishes and also a variety of imported sodas. Very tasty!

Rife were the jokes about Brits and how they would boil toast,  and that the only decent thing you could ever eat in London was Fish & Chips.Well, thank God some things have changed for the better and some things have stayed the same. London is now one of the foodie capitals of the world but the English tradition of great Fish & Chips, with a few small changes and updates,  continues here. I guess it shows what a total opposite of a scenester/ hipster I am since this was my first visit. I've heard tons about this place the past 2 years and I came in with so-so expectations.There are several versions of Fish & Chips here, differing either in the type of fish or the type of batter they use. I went with the Sole with Sour Cream and Onion batter. It was great and so was the fact that even though everything is deep-fried in oil, nothing came off as greasy or swimming in pools of oil. It was almost light.I saw a few other interesting items on the menu which i was too full to try but I intend to come back and at least try their Scotch Egg as well as their Deep-Fried anything dessert. Prices are really decent and the service is friendly as well. Bonus: If you love Cadbury Flake chocolates like I do and make a point of buying them in bulk everytime you fly through London Heathrow, they serve Cadbury Flake chocolate bar with ice-cream here as well!"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I may be the last person to try out Brit &amp; Chips in this city but hey I finally got to it over the weekend, so let me bore you with my experience, okay? For the uninitiated, Brit and Chips is exactly what it sounds like - a fish and chips shop. They originally opened up in Old Montreal and have relatively recently opened up a second location in the Cote des Neiges district. They offer a variety of different fish and batter combinations along with other British fare such as scotch eggs, sausage rolls and meat pies. For my first experience, I decided to try one of their more eclectic options - hake in orange crush panure.Outside of the batter, which was quite amazing might I add, the rest of the dish is very traditional and very well done. The fish is nice and flaky and the batter is thin but very crispy. Add to that some nice fries and a dynamite tartar sauce and you have the makings of a great dish. To add to the experience, they have a variety of different British beers you can enjoy at the same time. Unlike most locations of this variety, Brit and Chips also does dessert which I must highlight. They have a deep-fry ""anything"" option which is essentially ""pick your chocolate bar from the options we have and we'll fry it for you"". It comes with or without soft serve ice cream depending in your preference. They had Reese's cups so I couldn't pass this up.It was exactly as decadent as you can imagine it would be. A perfect end to a very good meal.With the caveat of having not tried Comptoir 21 yet (in the works....eventually), Brit and Chips is by far the best option in the city for Fish and Chips. If you haven't gone yet, you must certainly do so when you are in the neighborhood.Cheers!"

It is rather pricey, About 12 dollars a meal, also its pretty heavy and greasy but definitely worth the extra cash and minutes on the treadmill.

It's a very casual, and maybe cramped, space. They do some interesting combinations, including a salmon fried in Guiness batter and a hake in Orange Crush, but all three of us ordered the daily special; blue cod in jalapeno batter. I also had a side of baked beans.The beans were decent, and the fries were pretty good. The fish was the great part. Lightly battered, flavorful fish, filling but not leaving you feeling stuffed. If I had just had a larger order of the fish with nothing else, the meal would have been even better.We decided to go for broke and order the Fried Whatever; they deep fry whatever candy bars they have lying around, and serve it with ice cream ($1.50 extra) for $5.00. It took awhile, but eventually 2 plates of 3 deep fried Reeses cups each, and one with a deep fried Snickers bar, were set down.Indulgent? Of course, but I've occasionally tried deep-fried candies (they're disgustingly popular at the New York State Fair) and these were actually pretty good. The batter didn't make you feel sick as you were eating it, as I tend to feel when thinking about just what ""deep-fried"" is. The ice cream wasn't great, but I'm a bit pickier with my ice cream than the average population, and this place is known for their fish, not their desserts."

The chips are small pieces of fried potato- different from normal french fries, and you can definitely tell how fresh they are.It's pretty cheap (about 10 to 12 per person).

It almost made me nauseous by the end of it, and don't get me wrong, I usually LOVE deep-fried anything.The chips were also soaked in frying oil, which made them kind of unbearable and grossly soft.

My wife and I both had the Haddock.  The fish was good and the batter was good but where the fish meets the batter was a bit slimy.  At first I thought that it was greasy or undercooked but it was not.  I think that the fish was not floured or egg washed before being dipped in the batter.They do not serve tea or coffee!  I think this is to turn the tables over faster.  Really wanted a tea after dinner.   I had the ""flake and ice cream"" dessert.  TERRIBLE, do not order.  As a Scotsman, I have had this often and what should have been a flake (Cadbury's) crushed over a French vanilla ice cream with a cup of tea was a waxy piece of chocolate stuck into the side some soft ice cream with a glass of water......I will go back as the selection of pies looked really good.  Would love if they had Scotch Pies on the menu.Service was exceptional and prices are good.  Worth a visit."

Brit & Chips owned by the same group as The Burgundy Lion Pub, has taken over the once coveted Mc Gill Hot Dog, and opened its doors to offer locals a more authentic fish and chips experience. With four staple fish options to combine with chips (british equivalent of french fries) they are well beyond most seafood spots in town.The menu also features Tandoori popcorn shrimp, a variety of pasties and other British foods including pork pies, and sausage rolls.A healthy option for those avoiding the deep fried page on the menu is the Seafood salad, which is a healthy portion at a great price.Where the Burgundy Lion has the pub atmosphere dialed in, Brit & Chips has the food perfectly locked in. For lunch or dinner the food is fresh, tasty, and substantial. It's also great for sharing.Dead center of the old port business district, expect it to be busy during the lunch rush."

They've been a staple in London since the late 1800s, and have been a personal family favourite in my home since I was about 8.Brit & Chips got off to a rough start but it was smooth sailing by the time we got our food.The patio was full so we headed inside.  The server who greeted us seemed cranky. But we grabbed a seat anyway and ordered. By the end, our server had gone from zero to hero. It seems we got there just in time (around 6:00 pm) because it filled up and before you know it, there was a long line. Our server's mood brightened and he started making jokes and smiling. He didn't even charge my sister for fries. You see, she had ordered just a serving of the cod (burgundy batter), but then I reminded her that I don't like sharing fries. So she asked him for a side order just before our dishes were served.I had the haddock (maple syrup batter) and we shared the tandoori popcorn shrimp.It's a little more expensive at $9.50 (for two pieces, $11.00 if you add chips) than I'm used to paying, but well worth it. The batters were tasty and crispy. I liked the cod better, my sister the haddock - good thing we shared. Both fish were meaty and tender, and with so many choices (salmon, hake and the fish of the day) share with friends and try them all. Except the fries, they're so yummy you'll want your own serving. I could dedicate an entire post to their tartar sauce - but I won't. It was delish - creamy, tangy, fresh with a hint of dill. Yum.My sister and I would both go back, but we'd probably skip the popcorn shrimp and try the mashed peas instead. So Brit."

As an American I feel a bit unqualified to make this claim but then again, after growing up with the full range of fried food options, I may be a suitable enough critic. Visiting Montreal for work and needed to order in dinner via Foodora. After a couple previous disappointing dinner deliveries, I was skeptical and decided to keep expectations low, especially for fried fish. Not only did the food arrive very quickly, but the fish was perfectly fried - the funnel cake balance of crispy and fluffy, not overly greasy and not overpowering the flavor of the batter. It was the right balance of sweet and savory all at once. I had the maple syrup batter on haddock and would order it a million times over. Very pleased that I thought to order the ""deep fried whatever"" dessert too - turned out to be some magical creation of fluffy crunchy battered chocolate marshmallow. Happy happy happy!"

It's your typical pub fare with a pretty extensive menu. The maple syrup battered haddock was pretty good, the maple wasn't too overpowering and the chips were GREAT. The service was also really good...the waiter kept making suggestions to make our bill total lower. I understand that Brit & Chips gets pretty busy and I imagine it would get really crowded as the tables are a bit close to one another. I was also surprised to see that they close at 10 or 11pm on weekends... I would've thought that a place like this would be a haven for those who need to...""recuperate"" ;)Definitely give Brit & Chips a try if you're jonesing for some legit English pub fare"

/user_details?userid=lXe4pzo99ZuRbmC0whTudQ,C. J.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was born and raised here in Montreal but I'm a huge Anglophile (no, not over the English language) and of course, I traveled to Britain. So when I discovered this place with a few friends of mine, I was thrilled to have a place to go to, as well as Burgundy Lion (which is owned by the same people) whenever I miss the UK. Which is pretty much all the time.The atmosphere of the place feels authentically British down to the newsprint tissue paper that is served on your plate. ""How sweet"", an English dining companion of mine commented. When I traveled to Britain, I didn't sample the fish and chips because I was a vegetarian at the time so the only dishes I could compare them to were the ones in Boston (they were fabulous) and McKibbin's, Aqua Lunch and Kelseys. Aqua Lunch and Kelseys don't necessarily count but either way, McKibbin's wasn't all that impressive and was way too greasy for my tastes.Enter Brit and Chips. Tried the usual batter, the Doritos one and the sour cream and onion one as well. I find myself craving them all the time. And the haloumi is another addictive item I find myself ordering every time I'm there. The batter is crispy and greasy but not greasy enough to the point where you feel as if you're drinking and tasting oil more than the fish (or the cheese) itself. So why the 3 star rating?Because their staff is quite rude. Rude enough for me to wonder if this was part of their attempt at British authenticity. The service workers in the UK are usually not all that perky and smiley and I've witnessed some pretty blunt fights between service workers and customers that we would never get away with over here in North America. But I don't necessarily expect smiles or anything like that. Anyway, I have walked into Brit and Chips on more than one occasion feeling as if I just interrupted something. I walk in, nobody says hi, everybody just stares at you and it feels like high school all over again. Sometimes I am at the cash, waiting awkwardly for someone to notice and to take my order. What the? I have felt unwelcome on several occasions and that's not something a customer should feel especially if they're giving you business! I don't expect feigned joy at the sight of me but an instant hello, smile or not, does the trick.The straw that broke the camel's back was when the cashier girl asked me--and I will quote her verbatim ""you didn't tip. Was that intentional?"" and then proceeded to screw up my order upon that discovery. I was pissed. That was the tackiest thing an employee from Brit and Chips has done. I have tipped other employees generously (the ones who have covered the basics like acknowledging me) but I am also a regular and this was takeout. Managers, you either need to hire new staff or train them to have courtesy towards your customers!"

/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The most recent addition to Montreal's recent fish & chips revival is Brit & Chips and they've gone to great lengths to get the details right (from the Irn Bru to the Sarson's), while leaving the door open to play with the formula (one batter features Orange Crush, another features maple syrup, and one of their fish options is salmon). Most importantly, their fish is fresh, it's sustainable (!), and the two varieties I've tried (beer-battered cod and Orange Crush-battered hake) were both exceptionally good. The chips were also tasty, if a little too limp to hold up to the requisite malt vinegar. Other standouts: the tandoori popcorn shrimp could have kicked up the spice a notch, but were juicy and sweet and hard to stop eating; the steak and ale pie had a nice, flaky crust and the braised meat inside was ever so tender. More playfulness: the house dessert at the moment is a deep-fried whatever (i.e., whatever candy bar/sweet treat they have on hand--in our case, a Mr. Big bar). House beer is from The Burgundy Lion. A welcome informal addition to the Old Montreal dining scene."
