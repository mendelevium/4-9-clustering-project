I visited in the evening to this place . The restaurant has lot of decor and really quiet. ordered for fish and chicken tacos. The tacos were really great and out of this world. This place is definitely worth a visit with your friends and loved ones ."

/user_details?userid=mVRKwa4Ch4HSiEJ0KPRMIQ,Freddy G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing experience at Tin Tan tonight. Delicious tacos! Got the 60$ for 1 kilo deal. Half carnitas. Half al pastor. Will go there again soon. Extremely friendly staff. Service is numero uno.
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"On my way go visiting , I checked out places to dine nearby and found Taco Tin Tan. A small local flavoured Mexican business, bustling with people. The terrace and décor were cute. We opted to sit outdoors. There isn't much leg room to tell you the truth, but that's the beauty of joints like this one.Prices started at 15$ for 3 rather large sized tacos. I had the Montreal and octopus taco. Didn't really enjoy either that much - Montreal had melted mozerella that was off in flavour and the octopus wasnt cooked properly. I also had the Eloté that wasn't very flavourful - mostly watery canned corn topped with some paprika. Cocktails were jive - freshly made pina colada, no complaints there. I'm not a taco expert but I feel there are more authentic taco joints than taco tin tan."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Solid place though I'm surprised it won a ""best of"" competition on Yelp.I tried 3 of their tacos: (1) Al Pastor, (2) Mushroom Al Pastor, and (3) Shrimp. The shrimp was the biggest in size but my least favourite. The shrimp is fried but the batter is under seasoned. I thought the fixings in the tacos would make up for that but it did not. I guess I like some spice or salt tast when I crunch into batter.Both the Al Pastor and Mushroom Al Pastor were yummy. But both were also skimpy on the amount of filling in the tacos.One thing to note about these tacos: the corn tortillas are somewhere between soft and crispy - though closer to soft in feel and to crispy in colour. To be honest, not my favourite. I prefer the traditional classic (soft, slight char, slight steaming - in container not real steaming - to give light fluffiness to texture... that's what most real taco places I've tried do).Finally, drank a horchata. A bit sweet but very good (and a generous - maybe even shareable - portion size). Also had a Pina Colada. Ordered virgin but got alcoholic one. Size was small but taste was fine. Resto offered to reduce charge to virgin when I pointed out but I declined - from my perspective, I was happy they offered to do that but I was in a rush to leave for another obligation.The place is clean but there are much hipper options for places to hang out and eat tacos at in town. With that said, I might return for a lunch type thing (probably not for dinner and drinks)."
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute bustling taco place. Very quirky decor and not a lot of space, but they have a nice terasse. The menu is written on a chalkboard and isn't too big in variety (mostly tacos, but a few appetizers like soup, chips and guac, quesadillas too). Not outrageously expensive, but things are a bit pricey for the quantity you get (around 3 dollars per taco, you can only buy 4 at a time of the same kind). I wish the tacos came with some rice or beans or salad to make it a bit more filling. But the tacos themselves are very good, and seem authentic (I'm just a gringo though so take my opinion with a grain of salt). I got the carnitas, which are similar in texture to pulled pork, and they were very tender with some fatty bits. It was well seasoned and very tasty! I also tried the al pastor and enjoyed that as well, though I prefer the carnitas. I also shared the chips and guac with a friend. The guac was good and fresh, and the sauces were nice - the mild still has quite a kick to it, and according to my friends it was better than the hot one, which packed a lot of heat but was flat in flavor. There are also vegetarian options on the menu too. The servers were efficient and fairly friendly and managed to find seating for a party of six in a reasonablr amount of time, which we rrally appreciated. Also lots of cool cocktails and mexican drinks, which you can also get to go."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"At 2.50 per taco plus taxes (with a check-in) I tried one of each allowed with that offer: one Al Pastor and one Mushroom on fresher and slightly thicker corn tortillas than I've had other places - I still prefer flour ones. Both has pieces of pineapple other chopped additions, but the Al Pastor was much more flavorful than the mushroom - which was somewhat plain and disappointing. I tried the Hibiscus juice and it was quite nice. Their two sauces are good, with the green one being less spicy than the orange one - still not extreme but did make the mushroom bites more interesting.I was told the Horchata drink was good, but on the sweet side.I also heard the Huitacoche tasted like snails and the battered and fried shrimp tacos were worth ordering two orders of in one sitting.The décor is a mixed bag and includes a long brick wall, metal tables plus various posters; ranging from Pulp Fiction, the Shining and Snatch to Mexican wresting posters and then onto photos of Frida Kahlo in the restroom and in other spots around the restaurant.Overall, they have a nice selection of Mexican dishes and with a decent budget you can try several authentic-style dishes. Let's see if a group wants to get together and share orders as they come with three.Note: I will say the filling level of one of the tacos was significantly less than the other. I'm leaving my rating a four as from a-z it tilts that way."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"People usually recommend me this place to have some tacos. I have to agree, the tacos here are amazing.The flavor and presentation are ridiculously good. I had their pastor and campechano tacos. The latter have to be the best of their style in the City ( this coming from a Mexican and an all time campechano taco fan). Their sauces are yummy and spciy. So this place satisfies the three elements that make a taco good: 1. Good tortillas. Soft and a bit crunchy.  2. Good content. Meaning it's fresh and nicely.    spiced. 3. Good salsas. Hot, spicy and with tons of flavor. When talking about its environment, the decoration is awesome. I also had the chance to watch a football match (Liga MX) while drinking a couple of Mexican beers. It doesn't get more Mexican than this.I wanted to try their esquites (Legendary Mexican street food) but I was too full by the time I found them on the menu. Next time. They also play a lot of rock in Spanish, good rock in Spanish, which I believe is refreshing rather than the overused mariachi and bolero style of music in Mexican restaurants.Staff is cool and friendly. Come to eat and enjoy your tacos here, do it. You will never regret it. #NoEraPenal"
/user_details?userid=9DsdXJcwrrRBFw1pl0yosQ,John F.,"Arvada, CO",5 star rating,"WHOA! This place has amazing food. The guacamole is fresh and tasty! The mango and Horchata are amazing! And the tacos... you'll want to put a ring on them. Try the green (mild) and red (habanero hot) sauces, which will only enhance the experience. ¡Muy Excellente!"
/user_details?userid=Q6f-wmLKk6kPIq648ybmbw,Shiran B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If I can give this place more stars .. i most definitely would! I was so excited that Yelp had created an event for this place! *taco face off* I've been literally looking for a great taco place! And this guys.. THIS is my new home! As soon as you walk in , it has this funky but yet Mexican theme to it.. the place is very clean and just completely comfortable! The staff is Spanish/Mexican they all spoke the language which was soooooo authentic feelings happening! I felt like I was literally in Mexico having tacos in a local restaurant.. we tried the chorizo , shrimp , el Paso.. everything was delicious and beyond! We actually ended up ordering another order of the shrimp! That's how amazing it was! The tortilla was soft and so flavorful .. everything was seasoned perfectly and with just the right amount of love. The only meh part about the el Paso taco was the pineapple was canned rather than fresh. And I mean to each their own when making a recipe or a creation but I just feel for how amazing their food is and with fresh ingredients maybe a fresh pineapple would make it just perfect? Cocktails!! Holly God dam. The pina colada.. guys I'm literally moving into this restaurant. It was exactly what a pina colada should taste like! Funny thing is it had fresh pineapple as a decor! Haha .. Hands down best tacos in town."

/user_details?userid=a41IoxVZ05aGm8i1RtdTAA,Richard B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",5 star rating,Tacos in montreal. Who would have thought. Imagine my surprise that everyone working were speaking Spanish from mexico city. Unbelievably good. I'd suggest coming with a few friends. Because it's a restaurant tacos come in 3 per order. Need people to create cariety

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wonderful tacos! I generally dislike Americanized Mexican fast food but the stuff here is pretty authentic and everything is incredibly fresh. I had the lunch special of 3 tacos for $10.95 , I got the sirloin beef tacos and put hot sauce on them because I'm Indian after all and a spice-freak and they were perfect. Excellent guacamole also. Bonus: Tons of  cool wall art based on Latin American personalities and motifs."

/user_details?userid=gfgmYRvb-mriKmZil_RQcQ,Miriam M.,"Indianapolis, IN",3 star rating,"Here's the deal, I want to give it a higher rating but because I'm Mexican, I have high expectations for tacos. That's the reason why I am only giving this place a three star rating. I decided to visit because of the reviews. Let me say the size of the tacos is big! One taco is really more like two tacos. I had a chicken and an al pastor taco, they were okay. That's just it. I wish the pastor had more flavor.However, their guacamole and esquite are fantastic! The service was also very good. And I love that the food is cooked to order. You can basically see them cooking, and washing dishes. I like that for some reason. The place is small but it was not crowded when we stopped by on a Tuesday night."

I love the decorations and the atmosphere. This could be a perfect place to meet with friends or have a bite before going out. The tacos are flavorful and budget friendly. Definitely, a must visit!"
/user_details?userid=PuwysWYcU6-YCzIXpVGOog,Alex T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We were drawn in from the very high reviews and had high hopes but most of us didn't enjoy our meal.I didn't enjoy my steak tacos, and the chicken quesadilla was basically just two chicken tacos with cheese. I'm not a big fan of cilantro though and i didn't know it was part of the garnish since it wasn't listed in the ingredients. Almost everything comes with cilantro so if you like that then you're good, if not, make sure you ask to remove it. The fish taco was delicious though! If I came back I would just order those. They had a good special of 3x tacos for $11. They all have to be the same though. Find out what the favourites are here because we tried a wide variety and only a few stood out."
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Enjoyed my take-out tacos from here! I ordered the chicken and fish tacos. At first, I was worried about the price-to-quantity ratio, as the order came to $15 or so. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I got home and saw two fish tacos and a large chicken taco. It was plenty.I was asked if I wanted spicy salsa, said yes, and the server clarified whether I wanted it ""very"" spicy. I was glad I said medium, because it was hot! A nice authentic place that is definitely worth a try. Next time, I will come and have a drink on the patio!"
/user_details?userid=yqOTLxURLi49OQKQKT_UHg,Doug S.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"Had the machete de choriqueso and the fish taco. Both were great. The sauce that came with fish taco is outstanding. Owners were incredibly friendly had a nice chat with one while I was waiting for my take out. Word of caution, the place was very busy when I went, may want to make a reservation!"
/user_details?userid=NUJsFBSaa6RfHETL-ybBCA,Camille L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good little taco joint. Everybody here is super friendly and the service is efficient. Tacos are 3 for around 10-12$, and there are a few other options as well like quesadillas and ceviche. I would recommend the Al Pastor and the Campechano. As for their drinks, the margaritas and piña coladas are delicious.Only downside is that sometimes their tacos have too much liquid/not drained, so they fall apart quickly.Also this place is mostly gluten free! (But tell them when you order so they can be extra careful)"
/user_details?userid=lNsAxds7E0A31OW8xVZEYA,Cyndi N.,"Lake Forest, CA",5 star rating,"What a treat! Having been traveling all over Canada recently, I was wishing for something that was a bit closer to food I would find at home. Tacos Tin Tan did not disappoint. I had threes tacos, Chicken, Montreal (steak), and Nopalitos.  They were delicious and generous portions! The meats were tender and flavored perfectly, and the grilled onions and bell peppers inside the taco were also delicious. Two salsas provided were delicious and clearly home-made. Red super spicy hot! Green milder but delicious. I also had the guacamole which was perfectly chunky, just how I like it. It was delicious on the tacos. I highly recommend a stop. The place is small but has great character, and the service was excellent."
/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! Talk about good tacos. I'd have to say, it was one of the best tacos I've had Montreal. The restaurant is filled with fun posters, good music, and with place to sit in or outside. First off, their Coca Cola is straight out of mexico! Talk about authentic. Then, we started out with the guacamole and the mango & beet salad. Delicious ! We proceeded with the shrimp tacos, sirloin and grilled octopus. Wow talk about a great price for the quantity and quality of the taco! They were all very tasty and they gave us three of their sauces to try which we're very good. I would def come back here for my tacos. 5 STARS!"
/user_details?userid=qEDLbMCAssmvoetn4WgQnQ,Angie G.,"Seattle, WA",1 star rating,"We went to this place around 10:30pm on a Saturday hoping to find some great margaritas. Ending up with over-priced, minimally alcoholic, frozen margaritas that just tasted like salt. Not sure if they put salt at the bottom of the glass or what, but way too salty. Also got chips and guacamole and the guacamole was brown as if it had been sitting in a container all day. Overall, not impressed and over-priced for what they sell."

I recommend the sirloin and the chicken tacos as well.Avoiding the drinks would be a good idea, rather go for their Tres Leches Cake. It was divine - A perfect end to the best tacos in the city"
/user_details?userid=mBuizYiL2uFJiLjZ1qdIYg,Ruby S.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is easy to miss if you're passing by, but what a pleasant surprise it is! Their tacos are on the larger side, 2 or 3 leaves me feeling satisfied. They cook everything to order, which means the meats arrive juicy and not on the dry side, like most pre-prepped taco places tend to. I highly recommend the fish taco, vegetarian with guacamole (WOAH, Did not know you could make vegetables taste this good), and the chorizo. TL;DR hands down the best tacos I've had in my life. Go here."

We found this place on Yelp and went for lunch today and it was AMAZING. We started out with the quesadillas, which were simple yet delicious. We also got the sirloin and chorizo tacos. Both were a good size and perfectly made. The highlight of this place though was their guacamole... wow. Honestly, I would recommend going to Tintan just for the guacamole alone. So fresh, so delicious, and a great size portion. The staff is super friendly, the prices are great, and the food is to die for."
