/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Covid takeout was super easy. We ordered over the phone then picked up in person. This is the only takeout place that asked my husband to sanitize his hands before he used the keypad to pay. The restaurant was extremely clean and as far as I can tell they are not taking indoor seating. I could be wrong so I would call in advance and inquire. I loved the chopped parsley salad, my husband LOVED the Chicken Schawarma pita wrap. It was huge. I tried a bite and the spices were so exotic. I am just not a huge chicken fan so I didn't have much of it.The falafels were done perfectly. The fries had a seasoning on them I didn't love, so if you're averse to seasoning on fries maybe skip this. They also have large family style dishes and are the perfect spot for catering."

Husband and I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate, side of Carrot Salad and a plate of Harira fries. Quality of ingredients and the taste of the food was excellent! The main Shawarma plate was the star of the meal! It is pricier then getting a shawarma at Boustan or another Mediterranean restaurant but the different flavours here make up for it! The Harira fries were average and I wouldn't recommend them nor would I order the next time I visit this place!  Would recommend this spot!"

You can order once your order number comes up. We tried the roasted carrots, hummus and baba ganouj as well as their delicious sumac fries. You must absolutely have their freshly baked pitas!The flavors were true to themselves and everything was top quality!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Sumac is an adorable restaurant in the repertoire of St Henri, Griffintown. Initially, they assigned you to a table with a number and then you go to the counter and order your food. We ordered garlic labneh (feta pita, nuts, spices and creme fraiche), sumac fries, chopped salad, fennel salad and sabich plate (eggplants, eggs, pickled cucumbers). All food look very appetizing, and they were delicious too but they were missing a kick. I left the place with full belly but not a satisfied belly. The service was good; the ambiance was lively. I really love the location of this place. The restaurant itself is adorable. The place was busy and happening for sure... just my taste didn't agree with their food."

As you walk by Sumac and see all the smiling faces of people who are just so happy to be stuffing their faces with the world's best shawarma, you may continue your internal dialogue ""is this the place for me?"". The answer is YES. Sumac is the single best restaurant in Montreal and the only reason you should avoid it is if you're scared of becoming addicted to those heavenly hummus fries. I have never taken a single bite of anything from this restaurant that didn't leave me in absolutely bliss. ""Yes"" you tell yourself..""This is the place for me"""
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lovely middle eastern restaurant which has been quite successful over the last few years. Every time I was there, the place was pretty busy.I ordered the kefta plate which consists of two small but extremely delicious and juicy keftas, a choice of two salads along with hummus and pita.For the salads, I decided to go with: 1)the carrot salad & 2) fennel and cauliflower. The carrot salad was unbelievably delicious with a variety of spices. I have had this kind of salad many times elsewhere but this one was remarkably unique. The fennel and cauliflower was good but I am pretty sure you can guess which one of the two was my favourite ;-) On to the hummus, heavenly and so smooth. Last but not least, their pita was seasoned with Zaatar and some oil which was a wonderful touch. The only two small drawbacks are that their portions seem to have been reduced since the last time I was there. It would have been nice to have more meat on my plate. As well, even though there were a few free tables, I felt like there was a bit of a rush to get us out.Overall great experience and you should definitely try this place out and see for yourself!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I've visited Sumac on numerous occasions but unfortunately, I only documented (w/ pictures) my latest visit. Sumac doesn't take reservations and during peak hours (weekends + some evenings) it can get very busy and crowded. If you're going to visit, get there early or plan to wait - though take out is also an option.The food is great. I love Shawarmas and I love Sumac's especially because they are not only packed with flavour but the ingredients taste fresh and aren't greasy. Unlike many other popular Middle Eastern food chains, I don't feel sick after eating. I always get the chicken and my partner always gets the Beef Kefta. They're both delicious; I guess the choice really comes down to personal preference.Also, I believe that Sumac has some of the best fries in this city. Most times we get the fries by themselves (and they're perfect alone), but on our last visit, we got the Harira fries. It comes with Lamb Soup, Feta, Onions + Pepper - definitely a must!"
/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",2 star rating,"Hummus, salads, bread were descent but definitely not worth the price. Kefta were good too but way too salty. Same for the chicken, it was salty and extremely dry. Tasted like old left over chicken.My friend that is middle eastern returned his chicken and said that he does not like it because it doesn't taste authentic and that it's really dry. In the end, they asked his sister if she liked the meal but she suggested they should add rice to the plate as it was not that filling. They told her that they don't want to add rice because they don't want to be like the ""other"" places and that they are not a middle eastern place...while google clearly indicates that they are. They wanted feedback on food but were disrespectful with her answer. Summary: Don't go, there are many other places around town that serves better middle eastern food."

Their falafel plates are fantastic and I'm always craving them!Every time I go I order their falafel plate and a side of their famous sumac seasoned fries. The plate comes with your choice of 2 sides, 4 falafels, bread and a generous amount of hummus. Sumac is a great place for a quick bite to eat whether its for lunch or dinner. It has a welcoming atmosphere, great place to eat with some friends.I ordered their chicken once but wasn't a huge fan of it. Sticking to their falafels"
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very delicious food and decently sized portions, the plate will fill you right up! The flavour of their dishes are insane, with tons of unique spices and combinations. My only complaints are that it's quite expensive - roughly $20 for the plate (which at Boustan's is about $14, despite it being less tasty), and that they don't give a lot of grains other than the pita bread - I'd like it if they added rice or something as a non-side option"

I chose the fenouil&cauliflower salad and the "" Chou vert "" salad as my friend chose the quinoa salad and the cucumber salad. All the ingredients are fresh and well seasoned and we didn't have bad aftertaste.Service is friendly overall but they try to rush you to order and finish the plates to speed up the turnover. If you sit in the table in the middle you will need to share with other people."

Their ordering system and placement was rather awkward. Once you walk in, they ask you to wait at the counter. We had one party who ordered before us, but we had to wait until a table frees up before we can order. Ended up standing for a while beside dinner guests and trying not to block the path where the food comes out. :/The food is fairly priced and I recommend the platters for sharing! It comes with hummus, pits bread, your choice of protein, and two salads. The variety of salads were all delicious and flavourful. Got the chicken and falafel ones and they didn't disappoint either.Also recommend the sumac fries!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Sumac is one of the newer Middle Eastern restaurants in town. Completely different than La Petit Alep. Yes, I went to both in the same day. No, it wasn't intentional.Located in the up and coming St. Henri neighbourhood, I did a little walk around the 'hood while I waited for Cbear to get off work. Holy crap, this area is trendy.The inside is bumping. I shouldn't even be surprised but for a Tuesday evening, it was insane. Loud, bustling, it's definitely one the new ""it"" places. The line makes zero sense and trying to scrounge a table wasn't easy. There's one long communal table smack in the middle of things.A variety of drinks to please everyone. Beers on tap along with cocktails and wine. The menu is plastered onto some wooden planks along one of the walls. Salads, hummus & baba, extras, pitas, plates and family style plates. Love the sharing aspect here.- 2x Carlsberg ($8.00 each) - we each got a Carlsberg to go with our meals. The pints were ice cold and hit the spot.- Falafel plate ($14.00) - served with grilled pita, hummus, tahini, pickled turnip and a choice of two salads. The charred pita was pillowy goodness with a sprinkling of za'atar spice over top. We opted for the quinoa (kale, almonds, barberries, golden raisins and green onion) and salade cuite (slow cooked tomatoes and roasted sweet peppers). Both were absolutely delicious! Think they stole the spotlight from the falafels themselves, which were dry and unimpressive. I don't think we even finished the falafels. Yikes.- Side of chicken shawarma ($6.00) - we were taking forever to decide what to get so the worker manning the till helped us out. We were originally going to get a plate of chicken shawarma ($16.00) but she told us that we would get the same amount of meat if we were to just do it as a side. Okay! Thanks for the sweet tip.The chicken itself was tasty but some pieces felt like it had been sitting around for awhile. They must cook it beforehand or something.- Sumac fries ($4.00) - the fries were great. Excellent spice from the sumac and za'atar. Portion size is huge.We rolled out of Sumac stuffed. Lucky, we only ordered one full plate otherwise we would have had leftovers for days. Sumac is cool, hip and different from your typical Middle Easter/Lebanese joint."

We were 11 people and got here at 5pm on a Tuesday so there was plenty of space (it started getting very busy at 6 though). I had the Chicken shawarma plate and it was REALLY good. The portion was huge and I definitely could've stopped eating a lot sooner... but it was just so good! I got the cabbage and quinoa salads as the sides (quinoa was good but might've been a mistake because it was too filling). The cabbage salad I really liked. And of course, the shawarma was delicious too--not too dry, juicy, and not too oily! The pita was good too. Overall, a great experience and I'll be back to try other dishes!"

We came here as a large group for lunch and I have to say service was impeccable , they didnt miss a beat or any detail of any order. The location itself is casual but still clean and cozy (They dont take reservations). You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table. Everything on their menu sounded incredible, I wish I could have ordered one of everything :). I had the chicken plate with himmus, pita, salade cuite and carrot salad.  The hummus was silky and tasty and the pita was absolute fluffy heaven. The salade cuite was actually very on point and comparable to the homemade versions ive had and loved !  The carrot salad was not bad , but the carrots were a little undercooked  and a little too salty for my taste.  The chicken was juicy and tasty so no complaints there. I really enjoyed the food (and fair prices) and I will be back to try more of their delicious sounding menu and their drinks.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual lunch or dinner, the food is awesome , you wont be disappointed !"

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So my initial review of Sumac was 4 shiny stars due to the excellent tasty food. Since this early experience I've visited this restaurant a number of times when they have been busy and as a result of my experiences I must update my review.The food at Sumac continues to be terrific,  what is far less than terrific is the system the restaurant has in place for order taking and seating and the owners attitude. When you arrive at Sumac at a busy time they do not allow you to secure a seat before ordering. Therefor you are stuck waiting in the line to order with no idea if a seat will be available for you by the time you get to the front of the line. You also have not idea if the people in front of you in the line are there for a table or for takeout.  So the result is that you may end up waiting in line only to find out that there is no space for you to sit and there are a bunch of people standing around waiting for tables to open up. On a number of occasions I have seen or experienced the owner treating clients with an impatient and rough manner which is a real turnoff to me. I hope that Sumac figures out how to resolve these issues and provide great customer services so I can go back to enjoying their delicious food."
/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Casual in between fast food joint and proper sit down restaurant that serves up a killer middle eastern fare. The concept is simple, you line up and order your meal at the cashier, she gives you a number sign, you grab a spot in their convivial dining area and you wait impatiently for your food to be brought to you by a waiter. Portions are huge and their dip game is to die for! Best mouhamarra I have tried in Montreal hands down! I also love how they serve generous portions of salads to go with their plates. However, their spicy carrot salad was not spicy at all... They can definitely kick it up a notch! Their chicken shawarma is a lot meatier than your average chicken shawarma found in fast food joints; the quality of the meat is another level. However, the reason why I love middle eastern food so much is for the garlic sauce they always serve with it... Which in this case was replaced by hummus. Don't get me wrong, the hummus was excellent but just didn't quite have that tangy kick to it that garlic aioli offers. We had to order the garlic labneh on the side to please my palate. Overall, great place for a casual night out. Quality price ratio is excellent and they also serve alcohol!"

/user_details?userid=7LwNP-TCe1-pevp6KjYIPQ,Dan G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Not worth the hype!!I have heard from many people that this is a very good Mediterranean restaurant. So my wife and I decided to try it one Saturday night. First of all the ordering system is very weird. You stand in line and wait for someone to give you a number which will correspond with a table that you eventually get after you have placed your order at the counter. Once at your table the server brings you your order. We never made it to a table because we were 15 people back in the line and after 20 minutes of no one coming to explain how it works we went outside and ordered the food by phone for takeout. We came back in about 20 minutes to pickup the food and the person I was initially behind was still waiting in line. I asked at the pickup counter how it worked just in case I ever come back. My wife ordered the beef kefta pita and I ordered the chicken shawarma. We also ordered the Fennel fattoush and the Sumac fries to share. Let me say that my wife is Lebanese and we have eaten A LOT of Mediterranean food in our lives and this did not deliver at all on any level. The Kefta was dry and tasted of strange spices not like any Kefta we have ever eaten and my chicken tasted strangely like Indian food. So much that I left some of my meal for my 20 yr old son to finish later that night as a snack and when I asked him how he liked it he said it was OK and from which Indian restaurant did we order from!?!?! I enjoy different flavours but these we just OFF. The fennel fattoush was also a bust. These 2 ingredients did not mesh well and yet I love fennel and eat it in salad or with salmon all the time. The only saving grace were the Sumac fries which were probably the best fries I have had in a long time. They definitely lived up to their reputation!! There definitely seems to be a great following of this restaurant as the lineups and referrals indicate but there is definitely better Mediterranean restaurants available.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…

Pretty crackin spot with a nice setup and chill ambience. The also had some 90s hip hop bumpin. Never imagined I'd be eating a pita to Kurupt's infamous first verse on ""Xxxplosive (dirty version)"" but alas, there I was. I had the Kefta plate, which was delish. My partner liked her Chicken Shawerma plate. We also shared the hummus fries, which were good but overwhelming. Overall I'd give it a solid 3 stars."
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Some say Lebanese food should only be eaten out of a styrofoam container at 2am. To those people, I say go to Sumac. Sumac is the next level of Lebanese. The food tastes great and is clearly prepared fresh in their kitchen. I love the ambiance of Sumac and the fact that they have a full bar. The eating space consists of small tables and a long communal bench. The larger plate are meant to be shared between friends in a family style of eating. The room can get loud as the restaurant is super popular for dinner times but it's always such a warm and comfortable environment. I would come back for that eggplant salad any day. Food-wise I would say it tastes less greasy than some other fast-food places but I'm sure you can find the same quality Lebanese in other parts of the city. Definitely go for the experience though.

My husband and I were drawn in one evening; we had passed in front of the place several times and we were curious to see if they were any good. We had two falafel pitas and one small baba ganouj, all very tasty, fresh and filling. The pitas were especially big and warm. The waiting was longer than expected - although the entrée came fast, it took 20 minutes for the pitas to be served - we decided it was well worth the wait.The prices at Sumac are higher than at most other Lebanese chains around the city, however the quality of the food is clearly superior. When I brought that first eggplant dish to my mouth and tasted it, I knew for sure that whoever had prepared it actually cared. Their food is good and they know it!

Between the two of us there was still so much left over. All the salads we tried were incredible!This restaurant is so veggie friendly but not in the way that makes your omnivore friends grumpy to be there since they have an incredible spread of options. Their homemade drinks were wonderful and if you can't decide between the two ask for a half & half; it's insane. My only problem with the restaurant was that it didn't have a very clear ordering system. You have to give your order and then you sit down and they serve you. Even as we were taking our order it wasn't a very clear interaction. Over all though; the food is just so fantastic you won't remember anything else!

It's a middle eastern restaurant without being too ethnic which was very refreshing (although ethic places are amazing but we both found the twist in this restaurant really nice). I ordered the kafta plate with the quinoa and red cabbage salad while my friend had the eggplant plate with the quinoa and mixed salad. We also ordered a pitcher of the whiskey half and half cocktail and sumac fries to share. Our meals were out in under ten minutes and wow was every single thing absolutely delicious! Explosions of flavor erupted after bites of every single item and the cocktail was absolutely perfect. The food was beautifully plated and portions were very decent if not on the larger side.The restaurant was extremely packed (it was a Tuesday..) the entire 2 hours we were there and we couldn't find a single bad thing to say.

Their plates (which go for around $15) come with hummus, pita, and two small salads as sides. Third, the side dishes are delicious! Fourth, the main dishes are delicious! So far I have tried the chicken shawarma, beef kefta , and the falafel. All absolutely sublime. Their food is flavourful, and juicy. None of that dry stuff here. And last, fifth (for the fifth star), the ambiance is great. It is clean, it is nicely laid out, and the staff is very nice and accommodating. And top it all off, their washroom isn't a dump - it's actually cute. This has become my definitive ""must go to"" spot every time I am in Montréal. Hope it gets the credit it deserves...

Then when you order at the register you have to repeat that number and then you find a seat with your number sign up-for Americans, think of Sumac as a fast casual restaurant (there are waiters but they are not taking your order; I do not believe you have to tip at the table although there is a tip jar at the counter)-came in for lunch on a weekday and place was packed-got the chicken Shawarma plate for $16 CAD. you get pita, hummus, pickled turnip, tahini and choice of 2 salads (went with cucumber and quinoa)-food was light and fresh but delicious and flavorful at the same time. Was not heavy at all. Fresh -ask for hot sauce-restaurant is very bright and clean. Great place to chat as well-waiters come by with water frequently. Good service-would definitely come back. Less than a 10 minute walk from metro station-note they are closed on Sunday and MondayOverall a great eating experience"

/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"After seeing the delicious food photos on Yelp, I had to try this place, and I'm so glad I did! The place is chill, open brick walls, music in the background with loud crowds. It's a casual place where you order at the cashier, take a number for the table, and they bring the food to you. The workers don't check up on you after serving the food so just go up to the cashier or call them up. They were very friendly people.We ordered one of each of the family style meals and the portions were enough to fill all 6 of us up for around $20 per person, before taxes and tips, which is a good deal especially for the quality of the food we were served.So for the family meals, they have falafels, shawarma (chicken), kefta, sabich and salads. On the side we also ordered tahini hummus and pita bread. They brought out the bread and hummus first, for appetizer. Hummus with olive oil was amazing, super smooth and flavourful. Pita bread was good too, the bread itself didn't stand out but I liked the spices they put on top. Turns out the pita bread is the only thing not homemade here, but EVERYTHING else is, which is very impressive.For salads, we ordered beets, red cabbage, spicy carrots, quinoa, and cauliflower with fennel. They were all great, I especially liked the spicy carrots.The falafel was crunchy on the outside and had a lot of flavour. The shawarma was the most tender shawarma I've had in Montreal, and among my top 5 for best chicken dish. The kefta reminded me of Japanese hamburg steak, it was good but not memorable compared to other dishes.The ultimate, best dish here, at least for me, was the sabich, which is fried eggplant topped with boiled eggs and pickled cucumber drenched in amba sauce. It's heavy but so, SO good that I could eat this until I drop dead. I would've licked the plate if the waitress didn't take away the plate. Overall a great experience for me, I'll be coming back for sure!"

I tried it with a few friends last week and although had heard that it was a good bet for Middle Eastern food, I didn't expect it to be as yummy as it was.There are tons of things to choose from on the menu (especially if you're a vegetarian) and everything we tasted was delicious from the felafel to the garlicky feta appetizer and babaghanoush. They also serve beers, cocktails and wine by the glass. In fact, they have a small but excellent wine selection that includes my favorite Nebbiolo that's hard to find anywhere in the city.The environment is quite casual (you order from the counter on your way in before being seated) but there's a good vibe and the atmosphere is pleasant. What's more, the service is friendly and on the ball and the prices are totally reasonable. Get ready to pay more for your food than a place like Basha, but the quality of ingredients, choice of dishes, and presentation (and restaurant atmosphere) are leaps and bounds above your typical Middle Eastern fast food.This is a great bet if you are looking for something yummy in St-Henri and are up for a casual experience."

I wandered into Sumac during lunch hour as the restaurant was only a quick walk from my office and I was craving Middle Eastern - specifically a falafel filled pita. The first impression of the restaurant was a good one. The decor and ambiance is open, airy and welcoming and employees are incredibly friendly. I can't say much for a dining experience as my order was for take-out but Sumac is on our list of places to dine at in the near future. It was easy to tell that they were undergoing a lunch rush but all orders were handled courteously and with a smile. I ordered the falafel pita (if you couldn't tell already) which came up to about $9.00 and a reasonable wait time for the time of day. Now $9.00 is reasonable for lunch but still more than what a falafel pita would cost at your nearest Boustan's or Amir - but after the first bite you'll find out why. Sumac JAM PACKS the pita full of falafel. I was actually taken a back at how much they managed to pack into one pita. And they were able to season and flavour the ingredients to my taste buds' satisfaction. I've been raving about this experience for some time now and can't wait to return for a full dining experience."

The quinoa one had what seemed like walnut pieces as well as zereshk berries, green onions and parsley. It was really nice.The eggplant salad is a eggplant mash.its tasty and offers a nice blend of flavors from a good use of exotic spices.. It is a bit on the heavy side but well worth itThe chicken was a bit less stellar as it was very stringy and tough. The flavour was a bit too ripe it seemed like really lesser  cuts and maybe reheated. Not bad but not as nice as it could be.The sumac fries were quite a fun dish. They were piping hit and crispy and absolutely covered in tart ground sumac. Lovely!The down note goes to the house iced tea. It tasted like powdered commercial mix, grainy and overly sweet. We could not drink it really it did not match meal at all. We stated this at the cash when asked but they still xharged us for it. So we wondered why ask then!"

Both are muy delicious! My experiences in restaurant and as catered take-out have been wonderful. Service is consistently good and order a half and half homemade lemonade / iced tea...top notch!Very cool locale also; the restaurant tends to get busy on end of week nights and remember to check the schedule because the number of times I have showed up on a Monday only to find it closed is killer...Overall very good and worth the trek from anywhere!"

However I will warn you, if you're not a ""saucy"" person...DO tell them to put minimal sauce (they tend to overdo it on the ""Sumac fries"").  It was a little crowded when I went so if you want a choice of seating, make sure to go at an ""off"" hour.

/user_details?userid=6elNm2xn9f3KS08bcK-cBw,Carrie-Ann K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"There's nothing wrong with Sumac, really, but I can't bring myself to give them four stars and here's why:1) lacks originality: As evidenced by their display of all of Ottolenghi's cookbooks, they are basically serving you someone else's recipes with nothing more, nothing less. It's a bit of a rip off, and as much as I enjoy zhoug (or ""s'rug"")... I have some in my fridge that I also made from ""Jerusalem"". The hummus was fine, but rather plain. Inspiration is one thing... But this... I don't know guys.2) bland: The portions are substantial, but I would not go so far as to call them copious, and I didn't finish my salads because they were seriously lacking flavour. I'm not saying I left hungry... But I wasn't stressing about getting my leftovers to go... cause they were just ok:3) overpriced: $20 got me a plate of food and a drink - the exact same thing I would have gotten from Boustan or Amor for half that price. Yes, Sumac is pretty-ish and clean... But the differences pretty much end there. You're gonna have to do a lot more than line some cookbooks on the shelves to get me to pay double for something that was not much better than (and in the case of the bland salads, actually not even up to par with) your discount competition.The service was lovely, but I was a bit surprised that when I paid by card I was proposed to tip 15-20-25%. Having worked as an actual waitress who had her wages garnished by the government based on food sales... Just.... No. You're entitled to your tip jar, fine, but those of us who actually bust out butts for less than minimum wage and are forced to give up to half our tips to the taxman are gonna be pretty miffed to see you proposing a 20% or 25% option on your debit machine.

The sabbich was very good, but since I am not a huge fan of eggplants, I was grateful that I was sharing the dish with other people. Their harira soup is very thick and served in a mug; perfect for a cold winter night!  Everything at Sumac ss packed with flavors! Overall, I did find it a little too salty and it is the main reason I may not be going as frequently as I would want to. Then again, I find a lot of restaurant food salty, so you might think the flavor is just right.  Price-wise, it's great value for the quality of food you are getting."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Outside of a few specific food items, I considered myself pretty adventurous food wise. While my parents did expose me to many different things outside of our French-Canadian customs, it wasn't until I moved downtown for school did I learn to enjoy some more ""obscure"" (at least from my perspective) food cultures. All of this came to mind when I heard about a new restaurant in St-Henri serving up great Middle Eastern cuisine. This type of cuisine is still a huge blind spot in my food knowledge so I was very hopeful that Sumac could show me the way.Located on the main strip of Notre Dame just west of the Atwater Market, Sumac has a very clean and sharp look. They beautifully utilize the brick wall of the old building and compliment it with pure white walls, light hardwood floors and solid wood tables. The ample lighting create a very bright space that creates a warm feel. They have a slight different ordering procedure where you order at the counter and then serve you at your table using number cards. The issue, in the two times I have been, was that because the menu is only on the wall right by the cash, people take a little too long to order as they figure what to order. As such, the lineup at the counter gets long and takes longer than it probably should. The line spills into the seating space which isn't great either for the patrons seating down. Also, there isn't really a good spot for takeout people to wait either. Note that I went on two Friday nights so probably the peak period for this problem. I imagine it is much better the rest of the time - not a big deal, simply a minor observation.The menu is one befitting a falafel shop - falafels, chicken shawarma, beef kefta with a assortment of salads, grains, fries, hummus and baba. On my first visit, I decided to start with the hummus fries with hummus, tahini and s'rug. This dish was one of the first things I saw online from Sumac and peaked my interest tremendously. Just wonderful all around - the fries were nicely crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The combination of the creamy tahini, the spice of the s'rug and the rich hummus worked exceptionally well - I had no knowledge of s'rug prior to this and my limited time with tahini never made me think of this combination. Great starter and a huge portion as well. A must-have for sure!Given the size of the fries, I decided to go with a chicken shawarma pita to finish off the meal. When you order a pita at Sumac, it is grilled and filled with hummus, tahina, chopped salad, white &amp; purple cabbage and pickled turnip on top of your meal of choice. First off, the pita bread at Sumac is insanely good. Borderland obscene. Wherever they get them, I need to find out because they have put every other pita bread I've tried to shame. Thick but yet soft and chewy, the pita bread provided a great vessel for the rest of the ingredients. The chicken was nice and juicy and the vegetables fresh and crisp. An excellent pita all around.I was so enthused by my first visit that I decided to return two weeks later for a quick takeout. In this instance, I broke my own rule and didn't order the fries in order to try some more of the menu. First, I went with the garlic labneh served with bulgarian feta, dukkah, paprika oil, mint and a side of grilled pita bread. A wonderful appetizer that needed a lot more bread than I got! I loved how the labneh and feta mixed together - combining the saltiness and firmer texture of the feta with the yogourt-like creaminess and sour taste of the labneh. The nutty mixture of the dukkah with the fresh mint and spicy paprika oil helped to ease up the heavy richness of the dish. Very nice all around and made for a great snack using the leftovers.My main course this second time was the falafel plat served with pita, hummus, tahini, pickled turnip and my choice of two salads. I went with the fried eggplant (with harissa, preserved lemon and coriander) and the Moroccan carrots with currants, cumin and parsley. Enjoyed the carrots although they weren't as spicy as I expected. As for the eggplant, it was okay - something didn't grab me and frankly I'm not sure what. As for the falafels themselves, loved them. Great crunch to the exterior but they still kept a nice moistness inside. Nice depth of flavour as well.Sumac provided me with a wonderful trip into Middle Eastern cuisine which was my hope. My initial visit got me interested enough to head back to try more and my second visit did more of the same. I may lack knowledge in this cuisine but I know enough about great cuisine to know that Sumac does it very well. Some of you may be scared away simply by the type of cuisine but believe me, you would be doing yourselves a grave disservice to ignore the wonderful food coming out of this little shop in St-Henri. You should have time on your side if you change your mind - I suspect Sumac will be a staple in the neighbourhood for some time.Cheers!"

The salads could use a little touch of love, i.e. a little more flavour, but wonderful that they offer ~6 salads to choose from. The hummus fries are just fries dumped with hummus, good- but I would suggest ordering fries with a side of hummus for dipping. Hummus was mediocre.

Definitely a place that would be ideal for a date, family dinner or casual grab-and-go. And, a perfect fit in St. Henri."
/user_details?userid=zR2RIA8HL2YoRwuwy-4E6g,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The food is very plain. I wouldn't even pay the price of fast food for it. I was fortunate to taste good Arabic food in different Arabic countries and this pales in comparison.The Shawerma meat was bland. It was drowned in Hummus.The Falafel sandwich was lackluster and I've tasted better in fast food joints like Crazy Falafel.The fries and Hummus were plain.Service was good. Decor was nice.What it comes down to is overpriced below average food. If you want good but pricey Arabic dishes, I would suggest Damas on Parc."

Loved the setting-  middle-eastern food with great cocktails and nice music playing! Will definitely go back and recommend to friends
/user_details?userid=6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",5 star rating,There is a jug of water waiting for you on the table! We were 3 people and ordered 3 plates to share. The chicken shawarma was my favorite. It comes with side salads. The hummus is home made and out of this world! The place has a cool vibe. It covers a niche market between upscale Mediterranean and fast food. You order off a menu posted on the wall. They don't take reservations. The kitchen closes at 10:00. Good service. The food is just really great! I am definitely coming back!
/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The ambiance and the restaurant was great! Simple as it gets in terms of decorations, yet that is what I like. The food in general was delicious, unlike many other restaurants who have a heavy hand on the salt, Sumac was perfect on the salt. At last a restaurant that doesn't rely on only salt for flavor. Our meal arrived to our table in a matter of 10-15 mins, while the restaurant  was packed. So I was impressed with that.  While our meal was very tasty, it lacked warmth. It wasn't cold, but borderline of being cold. Nothing was too warm. Disappointing!!My biggest disappointments: The method of ordering your food and the dessert. When you walk into the restaurant you first have to wait for a table, then order at the counter. There was one person with one cash taking all the orders. Because they only have one cash available. When you have a full house of 40+ people, you need more staff than just one person taking all the orders. So we waited 20-25 mins for our table, plus another 10 minutes to place our order. Very disappointing!! Our dessert was the Nutella brownie, with a cinnamon whipped cream not at all a Lebanese dessert yet, I was curious to try it. My question is.. Where was the Nutella? I honestly didn't taste one bit of of it! Luckily the whip cream was not out of can or spray, at last a restaurant that uses the real thing! Yet, it lacked taste. Bottom line,  Sumac opened very recently and it needs time to make some improvements. My biggest suggestion to them,  serve the food warm and not dry and semi-warm. The best thing: Their Hummus, Felafel and, all their salads. They were superb!!!"

I went with other 3 foodies and no one had anything but raves and compliments for this fresh, tasty, innovative restaurant! Definitely worth going and try the l'abneh appetizer. We shared (family style) a falafel plate, a chicken plate, 5 salads, french fries and we were pleasantly stuffed to the gills when we left.Congrats to the owner and team. Well done!!"

/user_details?userid=2UywhcuCsKbjbGzSpqQffQ,J L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Really good take on Middle Eastern food with some of the best falafels I've ever had.  Plates were plentiful, and all the dishes we had were very well made.  I would also highly recommend trying the house made drinks (iced tea and lemonade), which were both really good separately and mixed together (a la Arnold Palmer style).  The only thing I would critique is the hummus, which tasted more like straight pureed chickpeas without enough the usual hummus seasonings (lemon, tahini, spices) and also wasn't as creamy as hummus usually is.  I tend to like things less salty, so theirs was more than how I like things.  That said, I think the overwhelming majority of people would be OK with the seasoning level here - it's not more than other restaurants in general."
/user_details?userid=FUFfWhZIunMc3bbMzsfC0Q,Jessie P.,"Tampa, FL",5 star rating,I live in the usa and sumac is about a 5 hour drive from my house. I would go to canada just to eat at sumac. I am middle eastern and this is how middle eastern food should be. Im super picky and this is about the only middle eastern restaurant I would eat at outside of my house.  The manager is very friendly along with the rest of the staff. The restaurant is clean and the food is just amazing!
/user_details?userid=8lGPfe06mgEtvROds5fAlA,N H.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Loved this restaurant. The food is middle eastern with a trendy twist. The atmosphere is trendy and hip. Service was good. I've been to this restaurant twice and both times had a good time
/user_details?userid=ABRuCT6K3HJ4e0gWdtOmlA,Ella B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Tried this restaurant but would not go back. The food was less than average, and definitely not worth the price. I get better middle Eastern food at the fast food chains than that restaurant. It's inevitable to wait for more than half an hour as you can't make a reservation. The ambiance is loud, not in a good way, and the music (hip-hop) really not suiting the place. Tried the kafta, the meat was chewy and dry. The mouhammara (red pepper paste with walnuts) was good, the baba ghannouj (eggplant side dish) was average, and salads less than average. The owner was there and was very rude."
