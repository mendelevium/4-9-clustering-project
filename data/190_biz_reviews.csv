I had several takeout orders and delivery orders during this pandemic period. I am always happy with the food, the package and the waiting time.My husband's regular choice is the boss, and mine is changing all the time. I like the ones with mushrooms and the spicy chili sauce and pickled pepper.The fries may get a little soft but very good still. The coleslaw is very tasty and crunchy. I like their style."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"(Last visited 12/5/2019.) Here in Montréal on business (still) and I've been eating well for the most part, but I had a craving for a nice, juicy burger since I've seen this place while walking around downtown, so let's try it! Here's how it went.Atmosphere/Appearance: This place is quaint and tucked right on Rue Crescent. There is only street parking, so good luck with that. Lol. Once inside you're immediately met with the bar on the right and a line of 2-top/4-top tables that can be pushed together on the left. There's a very ""homey"" vibe here and I felt comfortable. It reminded me of just like, eating in someone's living room. Then you can go upstairs where there's another bar for the busy days and more seating. I really liked it in here.Service: The first time I came here Adrian took care of me and he was awesome. He took great care of me and made me feel so welcome. The 2nd time I came I got takeout, but was treated with the same respect as if I were dining in.Food: My first time I came I got the Brie & Mushroom AAA Bison Burger. LAWD! It was fantastic. It was so juicy, meaty, savory and just amazing. I upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries and they were too... fantastic. Burger Bar KILLED it. So while I was perusing the menu, I noticed they had wings. Y'all know how I feel about wings, so say no more. 2 days after that burger (likely a Wednesday for Wing Wednesday), I came back and got an order or Buffalo Blue wings as well as their Extra Spicy wings. They were so good! The burger was a bit better, but still the wings were fire FOR SURE. I'd totally come back for them.Value: (All prices are in $CAD.) My burger was $24.00 and to add the sweet potato fries was $3.95. My wings were $16.00 each and you get 10 in an order. Very good value for the quality of food that you get.In conclusion, I LOVED this place and it's easily one of my favorite places in Montréal to eat. I will absolutely come back here when I return for future visits."

I came with a group of ten of my friends. The restaurant is relatively large, with two floors. Usually the second floor of a restaurant lacks ambiance, but we were seated there due to the size of our group and I still loved the atmosphere. Most of us got the hangover burger because, obviously!!?? Just looking at it on the menu made me drool! 6 oz AAA beef patty, American cheese, smoked bacon, mini classic poutine, fried over-easy egg, caramelized onion and truffle oil. I don't know what anything else on the menu tastes like but, based on the hangover burger alone, I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. A great MTL restaurant, perfect for locals and visitors. 5 stars!!"

It was hard to choose just one. I got the supersonic burger which was so good with the spicy mayo . It had just enough kick ! We also ordered the pulled pork poutine - this was so good! We also got the poutine with the smoked meats but I liked the pulled pork better ! We also ordered wings- GENERAL TAO WINGS, SPICY JD BBQ WINGS and BUFFALO BLUE WINGS. I really liked the wings too! This was a great place I would be happy to go back ! There will 11 of us and service was great"

/user_details?userid=uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Got a table for five people on a Friday afternoon four lunch/dinner. Modern interior with wooden tables lining the wall for seating (and somehow not crowded at all).Wasn't necessarily in the mood for a burger, so ended up ordering the Smoked Meat Poutine ($18). A large platter of crisp fries with a thick gravy, cheese curds, smoked meat, and pickles on top. Curds weren't too chewy and the meat/gravy had lots of flavor. Felt like the ratio of curds to the fries and meat were a bit high. Beer list isn't extensive, however it is moderately priced at around $8-9.Server is quick and got our orders in without issue. Hopefully get to try the burgers someday."

That's right, for all you basic bitches, pumpkin spice season has finally started. On a more exciting note, this burger was definitely tricky to eat and yes I made it all happen- well at least half of it lol. This bad boy called The Hangover was the winner of Le Burger Week in the previous year: 6oz of AAA beef patty, American cheese, smoked bacon, fried over-easy egg, caramelized onion, truffle oil (UH. HELLO?‍) and to top it off- a built in poutine tower inside the burger. They got me at poutine and truffle . Trust, this is a nervous tick laughter because I had no idea how I was going to eat this beast. That's right. Forget about your skin tight dress and high waisted jeans. Make sure you go on a water fasting FOR DAYS before you choose to challenge yourself and clog your arteries with this bad boy. I thought I was brave.  Shit we do for the sake of food community.  As you may know, BURGER WEEK STARTS TOMORROW! I'm already starting to feel the regret but don't forget to vote! It makes eating messy burgers a little more fun. THANK YOU BURGER BAR FOR HAVING ME."

Juicy burger with bacon,tomatoes, American cheese topped with a fried egg. Once you have their burgers you won't go anywhere else. They have everything from burgers to poutine to Mac and Cheese and  milkshakes. Whatever your heart desires they have it. Can't wait to sit inside and try the hang-over burger.

To our surprise they had a burger on the menu that won #1 for Burger Week. I usually don't go for burgers and hesitate due to how they make me feel after BUT this was definitely one of the bets burgers I've had in YEARS. The poutine is also one of the best I had while in Canada and that says a lot. The drinks are good as well. It gets pretty packed so the service isn't as great as it could be but the food and drinks make up for it.

However this is super filling of course so it might ruin your appetite for the burger.The condiments in my burger were fresh and tasty (grilled red bell pepper, avocado, garlic mayo).However the burger patty (cow meat) was a little dry.

Fries were very good naked.But the poutine!!! So good. Cheesy, gooey, meaty and salty with a base of delicious fries. We got what we needed here. Will be back here next time in Montreal for sure.Good selection of beers (draft and bottled). It's a bar afterall."

I went to burger bar with a friend and it was amazingly delicious. I had the mac'n'cheese with bacon which was exquisite and my friend had a burger. One of the most juicy burger I've had. Cocktails was sumptuous and we had some shots to finish the night. Everything was great. We had a kind and friendly waitress who made the experience even more comfortable and personalized.

As for Sunday, they aren't that much people but the service was slow, but the waitress was very nice. We always had to chase after her as simple as asking for the menu to see desert. Since it's a burger place, they have various kinds including vegetarian, which is very appreciated. Depending of the burgers, some are really good and some are bland. Their milkshakes are awesome. Overall it's a fun place with the right crowd, personally I have been there 3 times."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"(3.5/5)Great place for a burger, however, a little bit pricey for what it is. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. It has a sort of classy but fun look and feel inside. The staff are all friendly too. I got the basic burger with an upgraded side of a poutine. The burger was really good. However, it lacked some sauce or juicy-ness to it. I did order it medium cooked but still felt there wasn't enough juice to it. I wish they added some type of bbq sauce to it for free. Side note, I also requested pickles on the burger and they were deliciously sour (the best kind!). The poutine was really tasty. There was a perfect consistency and ratio between the golden fries, ""sauce brun"" and cheese curds. I would highly recommend upgrading the side to a poutine!Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for their poutines and ambiance. The burgers are nothing special and can be found at a cheaper price elsewhere."

They have plenty of different burger options, all of them very well made, super tasty and with its own signature. I have had several of them already in the past 3 years, and loved all of them.

On our last day in Montreal, we decided to stop by and grab some lunch. the staff was very friendly. they had outdoor seating as well but we decided to stay inside with the AC as it was 80 degrees outside. this place has two floors which is understandable as the first floor doesn't have many tables. there's a bar on both floors and the bathrooms are upstairs. we ordered mozzarella sticks and i got the boss burger with a side of poutine and the boyfriend got the supersonic burger with a side of sweet potato fries. unfortunately the mozzarella sticks weren't worth getting. definitely regret that decision as they were small and barely filled with cheese. we were hoping for that magical cheese pull but instead got a cheese rip. for the price, they definitely should've been bigger and the cheese pull should've wowed us. the burgers, however, live up to the hype. very monstrous but also very delicious! the poutine was good and still crispy. as was the sweet potato fries. definitely a place i would recommend if one wants to crack open a cold one and enjoy a good burger!"

We had poutine several other times during our visit to the city, and this was the best.We also ended the night with milkshakes, which were also A+. This was one of our favorite finds in Montréal!"
/user_details?userid=3FrXYUTywEhmO8rTMq18XA,John J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best gourmet burger spot in the city and one of my personal favourites.The spicy wings are also awesome and have a pretty decent kick. I find the spice a bit inconsistent sometimes though, and it sometimes is on the weaker side. Probably 50k shu at its strongest.As for other appetizers, the mac and cheese is pretty good and so are the mozzarella sticks. The calamari is sad but I don't know why you would order that at a burger spot.Burgers are awesome. My go-to is the supersonic. If you prefer chicken, the grilled chicken sandwich is pretty sad (adding large avocado slides on a burger should be illegal, it's not going to stay together), but the fried one is a good pick.  While its not an option on the menu, they will let you build your own burger. Fries aren't too great and a bit bland. The portion is also pretty small. Onion rings are good."

It was perfectly air conditioned and had a good vibe going on with a nice mix of out-of-towners plus some locals/regulars (good and friendly banter to boot).Much to my surprise they had some well-priced drinks and excellent bar tenders with which to mix/pour them. A daily $7 special cocktail menu was also on offer, of which this particular night's was Negroni.Marine and Danielle sure know how to create very good ones at that. They even do a trick with the orange peel oil - no spoilers here - you'll have to see for yourself. I was also told that they do the same trick for their old fashioned cocktail (on special Wednesdays). An exception, but a good one to this list of specials is Saturday - when Sangria pitchers are $25 or you can get 5 Coronas for the same deal. Oh, and Sunday they do Bacon Caesars, also at $7 a pop, so perfect for 'brunch day'.If my team wins watching there, I just might become a regular myself. I've had their food on other occasions and it's of high quality and taste. I guess I've now experienced the Bar portion of Burger Bar..."

The burgers was packed with flavor and prepped just right. Truly hit the spot. The onion rings were prepped to perfection. No greasy. Perfectly cooked being crispy on the inside and soft and chewy on the inside. I really enjoyed my meal and loved they had some Stewart Black Cherry to accompany my meal.Service was quick and friendly, price-tag was good considering the location.My only gripe was the old fashioned I ordered for happy hour, it was way too strong and I opted to limit alcohol just there.Loved this place, would be back for sure."

The restaurant has two floors very compact but great layout. They have daily drink specials, we went on a Wednesday -7$ old fashioned and specials on beer.  I ordered a stout with the hangover burger for 20$, it was gigantic! A burger with poutine, american cheddar and beef and a fried egg (overly cooked). The presentation was incredible. I still had to take out the poutine portion out of the burger to eat it. The fries were dry, not enough sauce. I didn't finish the whole dish. I give the burger quality 3/5. Their dessert menu looked good but I was too ful to eat! if you check in with the yelp app you'll get 50% off dessert! Just a notefor birthdays, if you bring a cake there is a 20$ cake cutting fee."

It's a great restaurant/bar located right on crescent (infamous street). I love sitting on the patio. The service is a bit slow but they are always super friendly. The 2 things I love; The Fried Chicken Salad with Toasted Pecans! The Poutine is amazing. Most people would go to Montreal for la banquise or any other famous Poutine joint. I think those are all over rated. This place does it right! Layering the cheese curds & gravy over the fries. It's perfection. I can't wait to go back!Keep Eating, Angela"

My friend suggested Burger Bar Crescent and we decided to grab it as my last dinner in Montreal. We got sat almost immediately and was greeted by our server. Menu was all in French but luckily, I had my friend translate. I ended up getting the Quebecois - 6oz AAA beef patty, sautéed mushrooms, smoked bacon, Swiss cheese and caramelized onions. Bombbb. However, my friend got the Bacon Mac and Cheese and that stole the show. It was crispy and super cheesey. I wish I had gotten that instead and that says a lot, especially as a burger fan. So I would definitely recommend checking out this spot if you're in Montreal and definitely get the bacon Mac and cheese."

Their burgers have been cooked great to my liking every time, they have a nice variety from regular to kind of over the top toppings. Their buns are really amazing, they're super duper soft. I almost want to say their made in house but don't quote me on that. Not only do they have great burgers, but their poutine is really awesome to boot. The gravy is excellent, it stands out to me over other poutine spots in the area.My recommendation is The Boss burger and upgrade the fries to a poutine. Done deal. The chocolate chip cookie desert is good too."

Came here on Monday evening and wasn't packed at all. They have about 15+ beers on tap ranging from $6-$9 I believe. For my starters I had the spicy jack daniel wings. The sauce was good but the chicken overall was straight, bland kind of (a theme with the chicken wings at multiple establishments in Montreal). For my meal I shared/had a few things there: supersonic burger (excellent, tasted like I was eating a Italian sub burger), macaroni n cheese (also excellent), and the poutine (fries here are also pretty darn good, the poutine as a whole was good, but I would just go straight fries here).

/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As an American I have to say I've been pretty disappointed with most of the burgers I've had in Montreal. I just don't understand why they don't ask what temperature I want my burger cooked, and then cook it to medium well/well done every time. However, Burger Bar DOES ask, and as the first place I've been to that asked (and cooked it to a proper medium rare) they automatically were ahead in my book. I had the poutine burger, which was really impressive to look at and really delicious to eat. The poutine is kind of like a cylinder of french fries fried together with gravy and cheese curds. I was really impressed with how well it stayed together while I ate it (with a fork and knife.) I got it with a salad instead of fries because that seemed more reasonable. Everyone I ate with also said they enjoyed their burgers.Our waitress was super nice although the food came out a bit slowly. We went on a Tuesday or Wednesday night so it wasn't very busy at all. All in all solid burger, and definitely one of the best I've had in the city so far. I'd go back if I were in the area."

I was drawn to so many tasty options that I was almost pulled away from ordering a burger, but I mean its literally in the name so how do you not get one right? Best call I made all night. The Bacon and Mac Cheese was calling to me, but had to go with the Poutine. We opted for the Hangover Poutine, which is a tasty piece of work. The egg is next level, plus bacon...yep its amazing. My wife opted for the Jack Daniels Burger and I had to go with the Royale with Cheese. I read some reviews before we went in about how spot their cook was for the burgers and they did not disappoint. Both of our burgers: Spot. ON. Med Rare. We got some solid recommendations on our beer from our server and she kept them coming.

His was quite delicious and would highly recommend it.  The reason I did not like my burger was the sauce. ASK for the 911 sauce on the side!!!! The sauce was pour over the burger and it was overpowering that I barely tasted my burger. Way too spicy. I feel I lost out on tasting a really good burger. Other than the 911 sauce, everything else was good. The fries were delicious. I also got the sangria which was good. The place is pretty pricey though but worth the money.

/user_details?userid=7jdjcNBbcpNKFlHRduZIxA,Sophia L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Overall: gooooooood food, good vibes, + close to MTL shopping. SERVICE: We arrived earlier in the evening, and was seated immediately. I would say it was a bit slow, and here's why: they had plenty of servers. If I think about it now, they had about 7-9 running around, a few for upstairs, and few for downstairs, and a few bus waiters. But for the first 5 minutes, so many waited walked by us even though we had stopped looking at the menus, and was evidently waiting for someone to take our order. I guess only the waitress for our table is allowed to wait on us? It took a while for her to come... but that's the only negative thing I'll say about service, because as soon as we put in our orders there was nothing wrong with it. FOOD: This part was a bit slow. We ordered 2 Stella's (beer) which came quick, but then the classic poutine took awhile to come. Once the poutine came, we gulped it down. It was good poutine. Nothing outstanding. I would go back for it if I ran out of options during my stay. (If you are going here though, definitely order it. You won't be disappointed. To reiterate, I was neither disappointed nor wowed.) The burgers also took awhile to come...but boy was it WORTH IT. It was a very satisfying burger. You get the choice to choose salad, coleslaw, and fries for sides which is a very good variety. Get the coleslaw if you like them because their's is GOOD. (Although the color is vile....)OVERALL (cont.): Go early in the evening because even though they have two floors their tables are very close together so if you are slightly claustrophobic like me or have a big winter coat like me, then go early. Their burgers are gooooood. Get it. And they also have a lot of poutine variety so if you don't like a good old classic version I'm sure there will be something for you."

We came here with the Elite Squad before a show and I was very pleasantly surprised.The place was crowded when I came in. Not really my type of environment as it felt more sport bar-ish and very typical Crescent. I was skeptical at first but after seeing their menu I became more intrigued. The staff was very nice & polite, helpful as I asked if they have gluten free buns and thy went to make sure with the kitchen that they would make me lettuce buns instead since they don't have GF bread. The staff works quite hard and was still smiling the whole time which was nice to see.I took the simplest burger on the menu as I wanted to judge the burger in its purest form without the swag and it was great! Others took some pretty funky ones and they all seemed happy.

I mentioned one and the person asked me if I had a problem sitting at the bar and I mentioned that I didn't. I sat down and was handed a menu. I took a look at the menu and it was different from the online menu as it didn't list any bison burgers.The server asked me if I decided what I wanted and I asked whether they had any bison burgers. I was informed that they didn't   :-(One of the other servers corrected her and mentioned that I could have a bison patty instead of a beef patty for an upcharge. This wasn't mentioned in the menu anywhere (at least I didn't see it). Since I went to this restaurant specifically to try a bison burger, I decided to go for it. This didn't really make any sense to me as to why they didn't offer the bison burgers if they had bison patties since based on my understanding the only difference between a bison burger and a regular beef burger is the dressing with the burger and these are usually ""universal"" (like tomatoes, onions, caramelized onions, cheese, etc.) which are added or put on specific burgers.I ordered my beer and a burger and decided to swap the beef patty for a bison patty for the upcharge. The restaurant wasn't too crowded but there were people sitting outside in the patio as well as what looked to be a birthday party of maybe 12 people or celebration in another table. Where I work, the lunches are somewhat strict and it took me a few minutes to get there and would take me a few minutes to get back so I was a bit worried by my wait. I checked in on the Yelp app (as well as on Facebook) and noticed on Yelp, they had a special on the dessert.My burger and fries came within 15 minutes. The burger was big and the amount of fries were on the average size. The fries reminded me of the fries served at Five Guys except Five Guys drenches their fries in salt and the fries here were lightly seasoned. In terms of the burger that I had, I was expecting a bit more based on the hype of bison meat but it tasted like a beef burger to me. The burger bun was also very big/thick (a bit too big/thick for my liking for a burger). The fact that they didn't indicate bison burgers on the menu also made me suspect since based on my understanding, the only reason not to offer a bison burger and not have it on the menu is if there isn't any bison patties and if a place does have bison patties and has everything else to make/dress/garnish a beef burger, why don't they serve/advertise bison burgers? In terms of the burger that I had, it was a very good burger but not the best burger that I've had especially at the price that I paid for it.After finishing, I was interested in the dessert option especially with the Yelp 50% check-in deal but looked at my watch and I was running low on time so I decided to ask for my bill.Service-wise, I thought this place was okay but not excellent or good. The wait staff didn't ask me how my meal was during my meal nor did they refill my water when it was empty (not sure if it was because they saw me drinking my beer at the time). Once I finished my beer, my water was refilled without me asking. With the amount of people in the restaurant, I felt that waiting ~15 minutes for my meal was very good. I felt that they should also update their website to show their ""new"" menu which doesn't include their bison burgers."

We had a group of 9 which meant we had to wait just a bit but our hostess was very nice and accommodating. At the bar, my cousin and I tasted a few beers and settled on their house brewed beer and a cider. Both we really good.After being seated, we ordered a variety of burgers and poutines. The smoked meat poutine was really satisfying and tasted kind of like a pastrami. My blue cheese burger (recommended by our waiter) was sooo tasty. The meat patty was cooked just right, for me, medium-ish. A tiny touch of pink but mostly medium. Juicy and and salted just right. It seemed like a full house that evening so our burgers took a while to come out but they were certainly worth the wait. I chose a side of coleslaw to go with my burger which was a sweet vinaigrette slaw and surprisingly really refreshing and good.We finished off with a fried Mars bar dessert (50% off with a Yelp check in promo). The melty chocolate and crispy outside went really well with the ice cream. My bill was about $55 Canadian dollars which is really fair considering the portion size of the burgers!Service was great and food was awesome! Would definitely come here again!"

If you like cold beer and big burgers and tasty fries, this place is for you. If you like your fries to be covered in gravy and cheese curds, aka poutine, this place is for you. While the poutine here isnt the best, the poutine plus massive burgers are everything you ever could have hoped for and more. The beer selection could use some improvement, so dock a star there. It's also a bit dingy inside, but that's part of the charm."

The mac and cheese is better than homemade.They also have deep fried mars bars (2) to share because after the burgers you will be full. Try the Boss burger that has a fried egg on top! Yum yum!!

I had a hot and spicy poutine and a delicious burger.  The prices here are very reasonably priced and the portions are pretty decent.  I can definitely guarantee that you won't leave this place still hungry.  One of my my favorites parts of this city was that me and friends got to sit out on the balcony.  It came with a beautiful view and it only got better with a very pleasant staff serving us.  I cannot wait to come back here.

/user_details?userid=v5CvnfAVBX-KK5TLDmkFfA,Gerald R.,"Framingham, MA",5 star rating,"I couldn't come back to Montreal without coming to this place again. This place has a hip vibe to it always playing some cool music. Really a cool atmosphere whether you are going with your buddies, your girlfriend or mistress or as a first date. Their spiked lemonade or whatever they call it is very good. Doesn't taste like it has any booze in it but then you have two or three and your drunker than a Kennedy. I opted to start some wings as despite them being a Burger Bar (hence the name) their wings are top notch. I went with the General Tao wings. General Tao if you don't know led the Canadian army to an upset VICTORY over the hated Russians in the nineteen tickety two grand nationals of hockey. He is a real treasure. The wings are a but pricey but comparable for downtown Montreal. However they are phenomenal they have some spice to them but nothing overhlwhelming. The wings are huge as well and come with green onions on top. They are really good, this place could be a wing bar. After demolishing the wings I knew I needed a burger. Their menu is rich with some traditional burgers but being that I live a boring mundane life I decided to rip it up a bit and opted for ""The Dude"" which is a combo of beef, veal, and pork. This burger is only offered as well done as it has veal. It came shortly thereafter and it was a beast. The flavor blend is on point. Cooked perfectly and nice and juicy. Their buns not unlike my own is a star on its own. It has what seems like everything bagel seasoning on it. It's very good as is this place thru and thru. This place has a mellow vibe with a hipster feel and food that will leave you in need of a cold shower. Don't be fooled that because it's on Crescent Street that it's a tourist trap it's not, I mean it is but it doesn't mean it's a place to be avoided you are doing yourself a big disservice by not coming here and stuffing your face."

Mine was the super hot one with a jalapeño relish, my wife's was chicken with pepper jack cheese and avocado. Both were delicious. Could've used a larger amount of chicken though, considering you pay 3$ upcharge. Overall an excellent dinner experience, with the interesting sights and sounds of the sidewalk."

Any place that has a whole section of their menu dedicated to poutine deserves free poutine for the rest of their life. I often don't eat meat and this place is awesome because they give you the option to supplement any meat options with a veggie black bean burger that melts in your mouth.

Burger Bar ended up beating everyone!The gravy at the other spots went from undersalted to good to eat oversalted. The fries varied from too soft, over salted and just right. The cheese curds were all pretty good.At burger bar all 3 were great! The fries weren't too greasy or soft, they were nice and crispy with good flavor but not too much to effect the combo of the gravy and fries. The gravy was spot on and add in the curds and this was my fav poutine spot. It's too bad I found it on my last day in Canada"

Of AAA beef, good American cheese, bacon and that beautiful fried over easy egg on it. I held the dinon mayo, as I don't like mayo and I threw in some red onions and my goodness; it was so so good that I cut in in quarters just to enjoy it longer, lol. Bite after bite of flavor packed in such goodness.I was greedy with this place, I even got the decadent Poutine which has confit duck and foie grass.

The *only* negative was that the tomato slice on the burger was one of those gross, pink out of season tomatoes. Our server was Julie and it was clear she was a pro. I'm from out of town, and I'm sure this isn't uncommon in Montreal, but I was impressed with how effortlessly she switched between perfect English and French."

The poutine burger was nearly impossible to eat, but everything inside - the mini poutine, the egg, smoked bacon - was cooked perfectly according to both, my friend and I.

They serve burgers , poutine, mac and cheese salad, wings , sandwiches and other classic bar type food but all with elevated quality and ingredients, The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable for the quality and the quantity that you get,  The atmosphere is very laid back, energetic and lively and the servers are always pleasant and attentive. I had their special Autumn spice cider sangria which was really nice , it had the light refreshing feel of summer sangria but the cinnamon and spices inside made it a nice autumn inspired cocktail, I really enjoyed it - not too sweet and not overpowering with the flavours. I ordered the Big blue burger with a side of poutine. The burger was huge , nice balance of meat and toppings , great blue cheese flavour without being overpowering - this is my go to burger , however the JD bbq sauce burger is also really good. The poutine was well made as well, I got a classic poutine they got all 3 elements perfect (tasty thick gravy, well cooked fries to stand up to it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and squeaky slightly melted cheese curds) - perfection :)  For dessert we had their warm house baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream , it was rich but very good - definitely better to order this to share though, the portion is pretty big. Great place for a group/friendly hangout or a casual date - this is just a fun , laid back spot serving really great quality burgers and cocktails for mid range prices - You cant go wrong !"

What drew me to this place was it reputation for having the best burger in all of Montreal. I must confess that, that claim may be true. I had a ""Dude"". Which consists of a 6 ounce patty (That can be doubled) fried onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms and spicy ketchup. The true star of this show was the beer and the barmaid Cammilia (If I spelled her name right). Thanks to her, I had the best conversation I've had since I've been on my holiday and I must say that she was terribly easy on the eyes. Because of the beer and conversation, I have to say that this simple, well thought out place is my favorite thus far during my #Montreal holiday"

Of course it is insanely huge, but it actually was really tasty.  Poutine, bacon, a fresh bun, and beef... why not? We had it with a crisp Caesar salad. I did not catch our servers name but she was friendly and quick with bringing out our food.  It did get loud in the restaurant, but it was not obnoxious.  Although the hangover was a bit of a novelty, I would go back for more."

/user_details?userid=nxQuVPVVmsR5xEvLJLfDyw,Michael C.,"Abbotsford, Canada",4 star rating,"On the list of ""must go"", I went. Being a burger fan this was right up my alley. In sum, burger ($16) was fantastic, and I got the poutine upgrade from regular fries ($3.95). Service, lacked. Hence the 4 stars, not 5. I had the ""Royale With Cheese"". The burger was spiced perfectly and cooked perfectly medium. Meat was hot, cheese melted, and veggies were cool and crisp. It hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp wilting the lettuce. Bacon was good: crispy and not overly salty. The dressing was a type of mayo/grainy mustard-mix... was great. The poutine (it is Montreal after all) was good as well, not overly salty which I find a lot of the gravies are.Service: Initially off to a good start I was seated right away, glass of water and asked for my drink ( a local red ale) which they brought promptly and took my order. After the meal, I waited for them to come around as my glass had one tiny sip left, and I would've liked another. I waited. I was on the patio, there were 10 others, so not like I was hidden away. Restaurant inside was only maybe 60-70% full. Still waiting, looking trying to get the attention of someone. A guy sat next to me, hostess who sat him gave him a water, said the server would be right out. 10-15 min later the guy who had long since put his menu down said 'forget it' and left. I'm still waiting, trying to get the attention of any server.I went inside to the bar and told them I'd like to pay my bill.  Bartender asked if I had everything I needed and I said ""no, what I wanted was another beer"" and then told her I'll go across the street to get one (Crescent Street has no end of cool places to grab a beer), and informed her of the other table that left because no one came out to the patio in a reasonable time."

/user_details?userid=8udmHPzKaNOtbgnrscUTFg,Jaz K.,"Mineola, Canada",5 star rating,"I could shout it from the hill tops. What a burger!! (Or two in this case)Visiting Montreal with the wife. Usual debate raging about which restaurants to hit up, which of the the old favorites we can't afford to miss, and what new spots to try. This place is close to the hotel we were staying and the subject of many good reviews so hopefully I'll have something to add.The ambience: casual, friendly, warm. Basic wooden table and chairs arrangement with brick wall and some prints on the walls. We were seated at a window seat by our server Mark. He was awesome. Friendly, engaging, and full of suggestions. Perfect service.Skipped appetizers and ordered some tap water and a coke to go with my burger. (Old school style)Burger 1: Foie Gras with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Amazing. The Caramel richness coupled with the juicy patty (which was cooked medium -ish and tasted perfect) was perfectly complimented by the onions and mushrooms. This was my favouriteBurger 2: The Firestorm burger. Hot hot hot!! But flavourful and not too much heat where you can't enjoy it. The jalapeño, banana peppers, and spicy sauce go great with the flavourful patty. For Le piece de resistance I added a fried egg to my burger. Wow! If you don't mind a bit of heat you can't go wrong with this burger.The Sides:Cole slaw: vinegar based, light, refreshing, tasty. Enjoyed by us both even the wife who doesn't particularly care for slawPoutin: no complaints. Came out a bit cooler than I'd like but otherwise fine. We barely ate it since the burgers are so big.Conclusion: premium burgers. Reasonable prices. Casual, friendly setting with great service and a good turn around time. This is exactly what it needs to be - a fun, messy, tasty experience enjoying a burger."

My requests to sit someplace other than the noisy bar were not honored, so I guess the customer is not always right. The staff seemed nice, but did not care if I was miserable or not.

This place serves THE BEST burgers I have ever had in my life. The staff there was amazing! So friendly, accommodating, and welcoming. Not to mention our waitress in particular was the best (shout out to Marine- if you go here and she is working definitely request her). My husband has a lot of food allergies so sometimes it is a struggle for him to eat at certain restaurant. But not here, Marine made sure that his meal was accommodated to his allergies and that it was not lacking in quality or quantity either. Marine really went above and beyond in her service to make sure everything was allergy friendly for him and he had enough options to switch out if he couldn't have what was normally offered with his meal (if you are her boss and reading this please let Marine know that her Boston friends with a lot of allergies give her a shout out and please let her know how awesome she is!) If you like bison burgers I highly recommend the Blue Candy Bison Burger, it was so juicy and the flavors together were out of this world! My friend also really enjoyed the shenanigans burger. Not only was the food amazing but the drinks were just as good. So if you are looking for a great place to eat with a fun atmosphere, amazing food, good drinks, and somewhere to spend your night look no further because Burger Bar Crescent is THE place to go!!!"

Dinner: we mixed it up with our dinner options. The burger I got was The Supreme. Really good, cheeseburger with a spicy mayo, pickles, onion rings and spicy peppers.

Amazing! We ate every last bite despite how full we were because it was THAT good! So many choices to choose from, and all looked delicious. We definitely recommend you go if you're hungry, enjoy good drinks, and a fun environment!"

The people beside us ordered wings 15min after us and their wings were there before our soup, like how it is even possible to prep wings faster than serving a soup.Server was rude, wasn't available when we needed him. Can't even say sorry for the delay or thank you when we were done, never coming back. It's sad how this place is beautiful and the food is good, but the service suck."

A 6oz AAA beef patty, caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and poutine all topped with an over-eazy egg. The only tiny change I'd make is that I'd prefer the poutine on the side because it is just too big to eat all stacked up together (I actually did end up taking the poutine out and eating it separately)."

I even bought a bottle of French wine (seriously folks, go to SAQ and get inexpensive French wine). Sadly, no. My 15 year-old autistic son had enough of our shenanigans and declared he'd only leave the hotel for a cheese burger. Fair point. This place was a 5 minute walk, we got a table right away, the service and the burgers were excellent. I got the bison Brie mushroom burger, so I could still feel fancy.

The burger was highly average at best, the same goes for the poutine. I'm a huge burger fan, but unfortunately this place didn't live up to my expectations."
/user_details?userid=WXgFEaQQ-YJag55nTN9r1Q,Eve D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I knew this place would be good, but I'm pleased to say that the burgers here were even better than expected! I was blown away by the quality! I went with my fiancé yesterday for a celebratory lunch. First impressions: small dining area, nice looking bar in front. Immediately greeted at the door and quickly seated. Not long after we had sat down, our waitress greeted us and asked us if we had any questions. A couple sitting next to us already had their food and were going on about how their burgers were the best burgers they've ever eaten (I have a feeling that a lot of people say this upon trying their first burger here, because not long after we had received our food, my fiancé was telling me the same and I agreed with him!).The burger selection was quite hard to choose from (because they all looked so good), I ended up ordering the Yosemite Sam (with avocado, smoked bacon, homemade salsa, roasted red peppers and chipotle mayo)(17$), with a poutine on the side (+3,50$), and my fiancé chose the current Burger Week submission, an Angus burger with 10 yr old cheddar, boar bacon, crispy onions, lettuce and a really delicious sauce with a smoky flavour to it (can't remember the name of it for the life of me)(15$), with onion rings on the side (+3,50$). We also each ordered a pint, mine being a Dublin's pub cider (8$) and his being a Guinness (9$).The burgers were HUGE! The beef patties were thick and full of flavour, with just a bit of pink in the middle (which is good, shame on restaurants that overcook their patties and ruin an otherwise good burger). My burger tasted mostly of bacon and salsa, with a mostly subtle flavour profile. Then I tried my fiancé's burger... OMG! It was really fantastic, between the gamey quality of the boar bacon, the smokiness of the sauce and the huge slice of aged cheddar, this burger really wowed the both of us. Other than the burgers, I found the gravy on my poutine to be one of the best I've had, which surprised me. It had a savoury quality to it, and was thick and dark. My fiancé ended up dipping his onion rings in the excess gravy, we both really loved it.Besides the food, our waitress was extremely friendly and welcoming, and the establisment itself was pleasing. The decor was nice and the music (which consisted of a lot of classic rock) wasn't too loud. The limited amount of tables on the main floor (there was also a dining area with a seperate bar on the second floor, not in use during lunch, along with restrooms) made for a more intimate dining experience. All of this made for a really amazing lunch, we would definitely come here again for our next date night!"

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I was confused on who exactly was serving us.

We loved our burgers, I'd strongly suggest the coleslaw or the salad as side. The burgers were quite heavy, we saw some other customers struggling with the hangover burger. Their 911 sauce was the best (Indians love spicy anything really). I am probably not going to go there for a while cause you need to be really starving to finish the portions but I highly recommend Burger Bar to anyone new in town or just anyone who wants a great burger and large portions.

Our server was very friendly and attentive without being overly so. We ordered the Jack Daniel Burger-really good, the JD sauce is rich, thick and on the sweet side. We failed to order the bacon well done and the flaccid bacon was a bummer. We had to try the award winning Hangover Burger-as scrumptious mess of AAA burger, American cheese, bacon, fried egg, caramelized onions & poutine with truffle oil. The burger was easily 6 inches tall and a feast of all our favorites. The server highly suggested a side of greens (I think he feared a massive coronary ).  As it turned out, the tangy dressing was the perfect acidic foil to the heavy burger. We had a great experience and will definitely return."

And to be honest I prefered the Royal bacon cheese over Le dude. I found Le dude a bit too greasy and dry at the same time because there wasn't any vegetables in it. On the other side the Royal bacon cheese burger was so refreshing and flavourful! I love it . Would totally return for this burger!

Their burgers here are HUGE. The one I ordered came complete with a slice of gouda about an inch thick. As a cheese lover, this was optimal. Also shared some wings and enjoyed the hot bbq sauce flavor as the wings were tender and easy to eat. Decent prices, worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood."

The service was excellent and the wait was quick.Ordered the Yosemite Sam burger and upgraded to onion rings. The patty was thick and juicy with a sexy pink center. It was topped with avocados, roasted red peppers, and homemade salsa, which added a nice freshness to a heavy burger. Even walking 10 mins in the cold from the restaurant to my place, the onion rings were still warm. I was most impressed with how they were still crispy!After tip and tax, burger and rings came out to $28, which can be steep if you're used to regular burger joints. Overall, loved the place.

Ok this place isn't really a secret anymore especially since they have been honored with the title of best burger in town. I stumbled (literally) on this place on rainy Sunday night. Being a rainy Sunday night, there wasn't really anyone in the place so service was very prompt and attentive. Like a true tourist I opted for the ""Poutine Burger""  Just in case you can't tell by the name, they take a burger and put poutine in it.. 2 awesome things and putting them together is ballsy. What I don't understand is how they got the poutine fries to stay together without collapsing. You need to harness your jenga skills or have a retractable jaw to eat this! Any way you decide to eat it, rest assured that it rest assured that it will be nom nom.. The fries, gravy and curds were all great quality and somehow managed to stay solid and tasty however the champ of the meal was the burger patty. I'm not too sure what you guys feed the cows up in Canada but man the burger tasted great!.While I was eating, the head chef came to bar to chat. He explained on where the meat came from and how long and arduous the process was. He took extreme pride in the ingredient selection and it showed.

If you are lucky enough to get a seat near the wall, you'll love how long and roomy the couches are, they provide enough room to relax and eat.The Bad: Not sure if it was just me, but personally I felt that the atmosphere/setting was lacking in the bar aspect... It's more of a lounge than a bar. Also for the price, the burgers can be a bit more on the beefier side...The Ugly: While the restaurant is clean, the walls could be a lot more cleaner in some areas...Overall experience: Defiantly one of the better burger joints, in Montreal.

I'm always about vibes and the restaurant offered a candlelit table with great music in the background. I was going to order the Baba but the waitress recommend a cheaper and similar option the Herbivore. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ burger with a fried egg we both got fries as a side. You have the options of ordering cole slaw or a mini poutine if you desire. My craving for Mac & cheese was satisfied when we ordered the traditional Mac. The cheesiness was heavenly and there was a slight spice touch which I thought helped with the multiple cheeses. Both burgers were packed with ingredients.

The place itself is cute, nothing special but the lighting gives good ambience, the staff is nice and don't forget about you, and obviously the food is good! Great burgers with a pretty insane selection, but if I'm honest I usually come here for the mac & cheese (specifically the wild shroom one-which is supposed to be an appetizer but it's so filling), it's super cheesy and creamy and just super delicious! The drinks are a little pricey but otherwise totally affordable place and worth it. :)"

/user_details?userid=o1Nob_XfbP06ijTDn-olVw,Jessica L.,"Union, NJ",5 star rating,"This burger bar has many burger options and side orders to choose from to suit all different kinds of needs and tastes. I came with a large group of family members and they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly on a Saturday night. After we were seated, we were greeted by a friendly and personable server named Ben. He checked up on us often to ensure we had plenty of water in our glasses, napkins, and cleared away anything we needed when we were finished. His positive attitude throughout the night definitely made our meal a much more enjoyable experience. As for my meal I had a wild shroom burger and substituted the beef patty with a grilled chicken patty (+3). What I love about this place is that you can also get your burger replaced with a bean burger or veggie patty as well. So if you are vegetarian, fear not! Plenty of options for you too. There is also a carb free or what I sometimes call ""gluten free"" option where you can replace the bun with lettuce pieces instead which my cousin ordered. Long story short, I had a great time and meal, and would definitely come again if I didn't live in the United States! I'd like to mention that this was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Quality ingredients, big portions, plenty of options, good service and fun atmosphere - you can't go wrong."

It had a great taste but be cause the burger was so high I had to eat it deconstructed. I wished I could taste all the flavours in one bite. My sister had the pulled pork, I would pass on that one, it was staked but it wasn't something I would crave or go out to get. We shared the poutine, it was a good side to our meal but wasn't the best I had and was pretty expensive for such a plain poutine. I know this will sound silly but the coleslaw was to die for! I seriously would order a plate of the slaw and be content. All in all a good meal but I wouldn't say it's the BEST burger in town. Try it out, rate or yourself:)"

Great choices of burgers at decent price for downtown. My personal favorite is the super sonic. But what stands out mostly for me was their superb poutines. Perhaps the best I have tasted in some time. Mostly due I think in part by the gravy they use. Simply wonderful. My only negative might be the size of the bar. Its called Burger Bar but yet they can only seat 7 at the bar downstairs? Regardless, great atmosphere and the menu is fantastic. Oh the service is pretty awesome also."

That being said, this is a far cry from being my favorite burger, let alone a place I'd return to.The problem is the burgers are EXPENSIVE. When I dish out $15+ for a burger, it had better be a Lark Creek steakburger, or something like one. These burgers are good, but the quality toppings mask what is essentially just generic beef with too little seasoning. I expect more for this price.Beside the burgers, the cheese sticks are fantastic. Panko-breaded with salsa for dipping; they're a perfect appetizer. They also have some choice beers on tap, including a few Keith's like the Blond and IPA.I liked Burger Bar, but I really wanted to like it more. When your bill comes out to $60 though and you don't feel like you've been blown away by the meat, you've got to call a spade a spade and move on."

The waiters are always very helpful and kind no matter how many different times we went there and being served by a different person. This time I took the Baba burger with a poutine as a side. The poutine was amazing! The burger was wonderful, perfect, the baba had mushrooms and had some grilled veggies in it. It was very fresh and much lighter than the other burgers i had in their menu. It is a lot less intense than the other burgers on their menu overall. I think it makes a perfect combination with the poutine as the taste of both blends so well together. I couldn't get enough of their poutine as the gravy was perfectly tasteful, not too salty just perfect. The fries were full potatoes and were fried perfectly. The cheese curds being amazingly good. I really hate cheese curds that make squeecky noises when you chew. And their cheese definitely do not do that! This is a well loved place for my lunch hours!

Frankly, it was getting on my nerves. Here at Burger Bar, service was speedy, getting me and my friend fed and out the door for more sight seeing in a timely manner. The food at Burger Bar is great too, nice and fresh and huge portions. Burger Bar gave me my first (and only) experience with poutine. I have to say I still would prefer cheese fries, but I was happy with this Canadian staple. Served in a bowl and slopping with gravy, the bottom got pretty soggy, but I guess that is the nature of the dish. When it came to choosing an entree, the menu was good size and there are a few chicken options for those who don't want/eat red meat and some salad options for those who refrain from animals of any sort. The side salad I got in place of fries was just a bowl of lettuce which I found a bit strange. No carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes.. ya know, the usual veggies you would find in a salad. Didn't matter much though because the main event was huge and stacked high with yummy goodness. My friend's side fries were a heaping portion, enough for me to steal a few. For about $15, I walked out stuffed."

I just felt obliged to go the salad route knowing this burger would put me at risk for clogged arteries as it is.Only annoying thing about the place... there were hornets flying around us constantly on the patio.  When the weather is nice in Montreal, you want to be outside, but it really was a nuisance."

It all started one afternoon when my dear lumberjack and I had a lovely time walking through Mont Royal. We mainly stopped for a drink and a quick snack before hopping on the Metro.Once inside, I knew we had chosen well. The background music was just that- background music, the decor was simple but trendy, and I saw the food being served at another table. (Only my sternly engraved manners kept me from helping myself to their food. The burgers looked fantastic!)Since we were only there for a snack- we ordered the soup du jour (an onion soup) and a grilled chorizo potato salad to share. The soup was fantastic! It was everything that a french onion soup should be and proved to be very difficult to share. The grilled chorizo potato salad with corn was a delightful mix of tastes. I am not ashamed to admit how giddy I was to feel the crunch of green onions in my bites. Green onions + potatoes+ chorizo = lots of Loli's mouth happinessI am only sorry that I live so far away and that the Burger Bar and I cannot be married.

I can't remember the burger my husband had but I believe it was the Hangover. He kept raving about how good it taste. The burgers are big so prepare to be stuffed once you're done eating. For dessert I had the pecan pie and he had the chocolate chip cookie. Both very delicious. The service was very attentive as well. I can't remember our waitress's name but she was a really sweet girl who kept coming over to make sure we were okay. If I'm ever in Montreal again I would definitely come back to this place."

Only 9 were served. When we asked the server, she said that they 'go by pounds, not numbers' Seriously? how should we believe that? 4. It took a long time to get a check even though there were enough servers that we almost missed our movie5. Unsatisfied with the service, we barely left any tips.

For desert I had the deep fried mars bars which also tasted yummy :) I wish they would update the menu as often as they would take items off because I wanted to try the brownie which unfortunately they did not have.Other than that, service was decent , water was always full and staff was very personable.

/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Burger Bar scores very high on good ideas, but sadly, there's a lot of room for improvement comes execution time. That pretty much sums up my dinner experience there recently.All four of us were so excited about the menu and had a hard time deciding which burger to pick. Indeed everything sounded so adventurous and delicious!  I was particularly attracted by the `Supersonic` which promised onion rings on top of the burger, although in the end settled for the Jack Daniel`s BBQ burger (what can I say... I love dem bacon strips). The others picked the Wild `Shrooms, Bison and Sicilian. My BBQ burger was not great and I believe it may have to do with the fact that it was served lukewarm (though we were seated right in front of the kitchen and could see the lineup of burgers waiting to be distributed to the tables). The cheese was melted, but it was no longer hot. The beef patty, which should be a burger's centre of attention, could barely hold its own taste.  The sauce was alright, but could be a little sweeter (I realize this is totally a personal taste thing). The buns... did nothing to improve the overall taste. The only silver lining in the cloud was the bacon strip, which was appropriately crispy and juicy at the same time. After we finished our respective burgers, I made a comment, as politely as possible, `Well, my burger was alright, but... ` Two of them quickly chimed in with similar comments. At least one of us really liked their dinner - that's the one who ordered the bison burger.The fries were alright, certainly not memorable. The chicken wings with bbq sauce were unforgiveably bland.  The mixed green salad, on the other hand, was fresh and bountiful.  I was disappointed with the food, but we still had a decent time there. The place was comfortable, the servers were friendly and the washroom clean. Oh well... nobody's perfect, and Burger Bar is definitely one of them."

We both ordered burgers and they were messy but DELICIOUS, choc full of fresh ingredients. Fries were perfect.

For the main courses we got the macaroni and cheese with shrooms as well as the Montreal meat burger.  I was not impressed with the macaroni at all.  The flavor was very one dimensional, and I got tired of it after just a couple of bites.  However, the burger was almost perfect.  The patty was cooked to a medium rare so the meat was juicy and tasteful. One top of the patty was Montreal meat which I'm fairly sure was a salami corn grilled beef. It was yummy and complimented the cheese and the party perfectly.  Service was great and the total came out to be 62 with everything.

/user_details?userid=EJO1ldrqhccFuvZrOc_0gg,Mel T.,"Montreal-Nord, Canada",1 star rating,"I've been to Burger Bar a few times in the past and always had a great experience however I was very disappointed yesterday. For one, it was F1 weekend. Of course, we were not expecting it to be five star service seeing as it was intensely packed and noisy outside on Crescent. We entered the restaurant which was not as full as we thought it would be. The hostess asked how many people we were and my boyfriend replied 4. She immediately shook her head and said she would not have any room at all (which was odd because we did not see many people waiting upstairs or on the terrace) My boyfriend kindly replied that he did not mind waiting (this was probably due to our great past experiences there that we were willing to wait). The hostess was VERY cold and just looked at us and told us it would be a 45 minute wait (as though it would turn us off and we would leave because it was 9:15PM). We moved over to the bar area. We were seated in 15 mins so it did not take 45 minutes. Our food was good. The spicy Jack Daniel's wings were not spicy at all. My Quebecois burger was delicious. We finished our meal and the restaurant was not so packed (there was 2 free tables near us). My boyfriend and I were super excited to have a dessert. We kindly asked the waitress for a dessert menu and she said we could not have dessert on F1 weekend. I didn't think anything of it until 3 women near us ordered the fried Mars bar. I was extremely angry. I explained to the waitress that it was very unfair to lie to us and she used some lame excuse and said that their waitress happened to be the manager and the manager had told the staff earlier that night no desserts allowed and she was essentially breaking her own rules. She asked if I wanted to order dessert. I did not want to stay there any longer. We were ready to pay for dessert and a few more rounds. We took our money and tip somewhere it was much more welcomed. I was very disappointed and still am. I will not be going back because I feel like the staff was just annoyed with us. They were not friendly and were willing to let us go and due to bad service they just lost a regular. I would highly recommend a change of staff. The bartenders however were extremely friendly (two women with glasses, one with shorter hair) they were great! The rest just treated us horribly."

CONS1.  The burger meat tasted bland and fell a little flat after the first bite. 2.  The Guinness Short Ribs were definitely tasty during the first bite but then started reminding me of a glorified sloppy joe.  :(  3.  The fries were too salty and way overcooked.  4.  The waitress with the leopard apron was nice but really spent way too much time flirting with the chef rather than doing her job.  I saw someone's freshly made mac and cheese sitting on the delivery counter for a few minutes as she chatted away.  Disclaimer: I come from LA where gourmet burger joints are everywhere (Father's Office, Umami, FukuBurger, G Burger).  It's competitive and really hard to beat.  For Montreal, Burger Bar is a good alternative to your regular pub burger perhaps."

/user_details?userid=9r15-GGBQ4cwNt54tNxMYQ,Nicole G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Although I'd been here before, and enjoyed my meal, this is my first review. I came here for lunch with a couple of girls from work. We walked in and the place was pretty much empty, which we were happy about because we didn't want to be too long. After being seated, we were given adequate time to look over the menu and make our decision. The waitress finally came over to get our orders; I went with the Jack Daniels BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. One of the previous times I had been, my boyfriend raved about the Jack Daniels burger, so I thought I'd give it a go. When we got our food, I was excited to dive in because I had been craving a burger all day. The burger was pretty good, however there was a flavour I couldn't pinpoint that I could've done without. The patty was cooked very well and was nice and juicy. I didn't taste much of the BBQ sauce which was a let-down, because if you're going to call it a Jack Daniels BBQ burger, make sure to load on the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. The sweet potato fries were a tad dry, but they were served with a delicious spicy mayo that I couldn't get enough of. I piled it onto the fries and the burger. The meal itself was decent; it hit the spot, but the burger did leave something to be desired in that it lacked said Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.As for the service, our waitress seemed to have an attitude problem; when we were ready to pay and get back to work, she brought over our bills and as soon as one of my companions put down a debit card (without knowing they do NOT take interac), she made a snotty remark that ""Oh we don't take debit here. That's why there's an ATM in the front"". I should've offered her a napkin for the attitude dripping from her lip. After she got money from the ATM, we had to wait around for an additional 5 minutes, standing around the table, with our coats on, waiting for her to come back. If any of you have ever been, you will know that on the first floor, all tables are visible from behind the bar. She easily saw us waiting, and waiting, and waiting, but neglected to come over. We eventually just went to her and then left. She unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth."

I am very finnicky when it comes to burgers (everything is judged against Burgatory!), so Burger Bar Crescent was just okay for me. It was good, but not amazing. I would go back and maybe try something else (I had the Yosemite Sam burger with sweet potato fries) to see if they can wow me. Portions were ample, which is always nice. What really jumped out at me was the great service. I've noticed a lot of the places I have dined at in Montreal have pretty awful service, but not Burger Bar. Our server was SUPER helpful and bent over backwards to make sure we were satisfied. I was impressed that they have 19 crimes red blend on their wine list, which is one of my favorites that I've never seen on a restaurant menu before. They have indoor and outdoor seating and heat lamps on the balcony. If you don't mind getting some secondhand smoke from people puffing away below, definitely sit outside for a great view of the action on the street while you dine!"

/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,The burgers here were average. I tried the veggie burger and found the consistency to be a little too soft and quite difficult to eat with how highly piled the other toppings were. Then saving grace were the fiery peppers and sauce that came in my burger and really added the flavour. My tablemate enjoyed the beef burger with wild mushrooms but also felt that it was nothing special. The service was fantastic and all of the staff was extremely friendly! I wouldn't go out of my way to go again but maybe if I'm around crescent I'd pop in!

However I wouldn't call this place a ""gourmet"" burger joint (even though they are priced like they are!).The fries are the typical style you find around Montreal. I can't really say I'm a fan. They're kinda soggy and not that great.If you sit on the patio, the neighboring restaurant is very busy, noisy, and smoky, so be prepared. This is Crescent street after all."
/user_details?userid=1652MDlbA0pOtsq7U1Ygow,Clayton V.,"Redmond, WA",3 star rating,"A solid lunch choice on Crescent. It certainly isn't a fast lunch venue, but that is to be expected for the street. The burgers themselves, are well cooked and seasoned. Great flavor, the fries solid. I have no real complaints to levy the food, but I also lack a glowing praise of it. It has a similar vibe to the other restaurants in Las Vegas and San Francisco which share the same name, and does them credit in its execution of the burgers. If you're craving a large, juicy, tasty burger served with a pint of beer. (Something I often do at lunch!) This is a fantastic choice for that. Also, the Poutine Burger is something to see, I still don't know how to attack that one without making a mess!"

I went on a Thursday night which seems to be a popular night of the week (my guess is happy hours?) anywho, we sat outside on the small patio that overlooked Crescent Street which was awesome aside from the fact that i had monstrous amounts of smoke billowing up my nose from the patrons down below (this is certainly not the restaurants fault but more of a little warning for people who want to sit outside)Service is awful. Our waitress was not friendly AT ALL and made us wait a good 25 minutes before she asked us what we would like to order (when we told her we only needed a few). As we were very patiently waiting, I was watching her pick her wedgie, constantly check her facebook on her cell phone, and towel slapping the bartender. Not once did she check on any of us outside until i aggressively tapped on the glass to motion her outside.Food was OK. It came out in good time however the burger and fries were cold. It was tasty ,as I ate the entire thing, but the fries were over salted and very mooshy. Like i said earlier, the place definitely has great potential. im hoping i just caught them on a bad night but be forewarned yelpers."

I ended up getting the Supersonic Burger, which comes with three onion rings on top of the bun and jarlsberg cheese, bacon, banana peppers.  The portion was decent, plus you can choose a side salad or fries.  I chose the salad, and it was a healthy size as well.  Overall, the food is worth coming back for.As for drinks they have a great list of classic cocktails.  However, I ordered the Dark 'n Stormy, but they were out or ginger beer :(.  I had to settle for a Negroni which was very good, but strong (the way I like it).Service was good too."

I went on Burger Week to try their ""Detour burger"" and had to pay for the fries because they lowered the price by 3$ for the event...which is not a discount if they take away the fries in my opinion. I pretty much payed the same price lol burger was okay but the sack was terrible. Fries were good. Service was slow. In total it cost 60$ plus tip for 2 burgers and 3 drinks."

We ordered our drinks (crescent pair was good - pear vodka, mango puree, club soda..) and then our meals.  I had the supersonic, with hot peppers (yay!), pickles (double yay!), jarlsberg,  and bacon, topped with three crispy onion rings. It was delicious.  The meat the juicy (but not undercooked) and the bacon was nice and crisp. The fries were good, but not exceptional.  My boyfriend had the smoked meat burger, which comes topped with swiss cheese, pickles and mustard - it was also very good. The side salad comes with mixed greens and a nice vinaigrette - delicious! My friend has the sicilian burger which I think was the best one (of the three I tried). The burger is made of ground beef and sausage, which makes it very moist and flavourful.  It's topped with roasted peppers, mozzarella,  black olives, arugula and basil.  To make it gluten free-friendly, they wrapped it in lettuce.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good too.  Whole wheat buns are also available if you're not into white bread. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meals.  The only issue was the slow service  - it took an hour after ordering to receive our meals.  Tables of two who ordered after us were served much more quickly."

There are 2 floors to Burger Bar, the first being the main reception area and the second I imagine opens up later on in the night as Crescent fills up with party-goers and clubbers.The menu is pretty extensive, but none of the burgers scream excitement or exoticism. We ordered the wild mushroom burger and the super sonic burger, accompanied with onion rings and sweet potato fries. The burgers  themselves were pretty good. The buns however, made them. A woman actually came into the restaurant and asked the they sell the buns! The onion rings were cut thick, and wasn't all batter- a good thing! For vegetarians, the option to swap out the meat burger for a black bean veggie patty is available, or there is a grilled veggie portabello sandwich available on the menu.

/user_details?userid=KTyWMF0SvXbgL3FMCNpaAA,Victoria S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Overall my experience at Burger Bar was VERY disappointing. I had called to make reservations for a Saturday night. Without knowing there was going to be a hockey night that same night. So with that in mind, I knew it was going to be busy and loud. Yet not poorly managed! It started off bad by them not being able to find our reservation. I mentioned when I called and who I spoke with. Which those details made little to no difference to the careless hostess. So we had to sit at a table which the music was blasting in our ears and the door kept opening and closing letting the cold air in. Eventually we were moved to a slightly better table. When ordering our meals at 8:30pm, one of our burgers weren't available. Ok, so we chose something else. When both of our meals arrived, they were well prepared, good and hot. So no complaints there.When we decided to order dessert, out of the 7 things they have in their menu, again three choices weren't available. One being a strawberry cheesecake and the other a Ben&Jerry's ice cream sundae. So we ordered the fried Mars bars. Which were good, but not great. They were clearly made in a rush. Again, disappointing! Especially on something so simple to make such as a fried Mars bar. My overall suggestion, DO NOT go on a very busy night. Such as a night when there's a hockey game or any type of show at the Bell Centre. This restaurant clearly cannot seem to handle large crowds very well. Not to mention that their floors both upstairs and downstairs were dangerously slippery!! Kindly dry or mop your floors and get a carpet for snowy/icy weather days."

I ordered the Jack Daniels BBQ burger and an order the grilled vegetable with chorizo poutine and split it with a friend. I can't even begin to describe the great flavor everything had. I stayed at this establishment for probably ... 5 hours. After the food and 2 pitchers of sangria later, we both felt like it was time well spent. If anyone is in that area, this place offers great service, great food, great sangria... A definite 5 star rating. The only recommendation would be, stick with the red sangria. The white sangria was good too but it felt too light and citrus-y. It would definitely make a good brunch drink. However the red sangria is a solid and delicious beverage.I will definitely visit this establishment again"

I left the meat above my forke & knife after eating bun & decoration to show something is wrong, the waitress passed by removed my plate without noticing. When I told her she said i'm sorry, so much for Hospitality Management & Service. I adsjed for a Fried Mars Bar with vanilla icecream. Waitress got me a spoon, when i tried cutting into the BAR i almost killed my neighbor with a fried Mars shrapnnel; this plate definitely needs a forke & knife to eat it. We asked for the bill, desert is 1$ more expensive then on the Menu. And this is supposed to be the award winning best burger place in Montréal ?!?!?!?!  What about service????? Customer experience??? Well u ca$hed your bill and won't see me again, NEEEEXT..."
/user_details?userid=KEBE1aRiOlE-AO-3arflCg,Pierre-Yves Y.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My burger was served cold. I complained. The waitress brought it back after they just reheated it. The meat was then warm but overcooked and dry. On top of this the buns were soggy. When the waitress asked me how it was, I politely said that it wasn't good and that it was a bad idea to reheat meat. She had been nice until that point but wasn't after that. I asked to talk to the manager to tell him that I was dissatisfied with the food. He listened and just said that he'll mention it to the cooks. I had to pay the full bill and it wasn't cheap. I am done with this place."

It's amazing.I had not eaten meat in three months and although I planned on ending my meat fast across the street at Dundees (see my review on them for why that did not happen), luckily the food gods intervened and my friend and I found our way to Burger Bar.  I welcome myself back into the meat world with a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was amazing.The meat was perfectly cooked and the buns were delicious.  Even the side salad that comes with it is perfectly dressed with an AWESOME dressing (orange honey vinaigrette maybe?) and some very fresh mixed greens.The ambience is perfect, the servers are great and the food is simply spectacular.  The menu is completely in French (which I think is awesome) and the poutine is phenomenal (the best I tasted in Montreal-the cheese curds are super fresh). They also have a cool bar and a small outdoor area.  DO yourself a favor and go now!"

/user_details?userid=4gBovwiJLKijLJq4-peRjg,Dominique B.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I really really love Burger Bar Crescent. I'm a vegetarian and have often been dissatisfied with the soy based veggie burgers at other restaurants. Burger Bar makes their own veggie burger and it's delicious. I also love their sweet potato fries, although find that an extra $4 to replace the regular fries by them is a bit steep.I knocked off one star because of their food delivery. When you order a burger from Burger Bar it costs the same price and they don't give you any fries. I think they should either reduce the price or add fries, as most burger places send fries with their burger.Beyond that I would recommend this place, it's a great atmosphere (just a fun place for young people to hang out) in a great location and the staff is always very friendly."

If the egg runs over the poutine and the burger it is just a great meat and fixin's experience. The staff was really friendly - Kayla was a very enthusiastic sales person for the bar and she was an encyclopedia of cool things to do and visit in Montreal She led us off the tourist path to the Plateau. We walked around there the whole day. Bottom line- great burgers and friendly staff. Go and say hey to Kayla."

/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The Spot:You know that what you're eating is really good when you decide it's totally worth it to have sauce and french fries dripping down your face in front of your new boss. Going out to grab a burger and fries typically conjures thoughts of fast food and cheap restaurants but the Burger Bar has refined this concept, bringing us gourmet burgers of great variety. The atmosphere is chic yet casual, a perfect place to drop by in no more than jeans and a t-shirt. Although considered yourself warned: by the end of the meal you may have to undo your top button, these portion sizes are not for the faint of heart.No where else will you find burgers with toppings piled so high that only a hippopotamus would be able to fit the entire thing into it's mouth. The burgers are relatively cheap with the average burger coming in between $12 to $15 range. The exception being the ""hundred dollar burger"", which luckily cashes in at $25. With a AAA beef patty, pan seared foie gras, caramelized onions, sautéed wild mushrooms with truffle oil, arugula and a demi glace, it certainly tastes like it's worth a crisp hundred bucks.What's Really Good:If you're in need of a filling meal and a good dose of iron, the Burger Bar is definitely a good place to go. Although probably not the best place to bring a date, because there is no way you are going to look sexy eating these dishes.For the tourist we recommend the poutine burger, because never again in your life will you be able to experience something as ridiculous. Imagine: a burger piled high with poutine, where you can also opt to get poutine on the side. Add in a Canadian beer and you are making our nation proud. We ordered the Kobe beef hotdog poutine as an appetizer (ok, so we may have overdid it on the poutine...), but felt the meal needed more kobe beef to justify the expense. Same with the lobster macaroni and cheese. The onion rings were really fresh and lightly battered and make a good swap for your fries.With gourmet burger spots popping up all over North American cities, Burger Bar is a fun, welcoming environment carving their niche as a combination of gourmet ingredients and insane portion sizes and toppings.You'll Wanna Know: If you're ordering appetizers and a burger, skip the side plate of fries and get a healthy leafy green salad instead; trust me, by the time you get to that point in the meal your body is going to be craving vegetables. There is a patio upstairs which is great for a breathe of fresh air, but it can be loud to eat out there during prime crescent street party time."

Boy was I wrong the menu really is amazing and original!!!! I had the Sicilian burger it was quite special and went back the very next week. For the price I would say it is in the top 3 best burger places in Montreal, what makes it stand out really is the well thought menu it is not just a damn good beef burger"

/user_details?userid=PxiLXpoSlQLmKnRWAxSPqg,Jason L.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Overall, this was a good meal.  The server was great... extremely friendly. The food was what I expected after reading the reviews. Solid burgers, nice salads, poutine was decent. What was really poor was the first impression upon walking in. My party of four walked in on a Sunday night around 8pm. The hostess immediately said they were busy and that it would be maybe an hour, without checking a single thing. I don't recall a more condescending hostess, and I wasn't sure why. I asked if there was a wait list? No. I could make a reservation for an hour or so. Okkk. Is there a spot we could wait? Look at me like I had three heads. Looking around the restaurant there were tables close to finishing up, but the hostess seemed uninterested in getting us in the door. We left the restaurant and looked for another spot on the sidewalk right outside. As we were doing this, she turned away a three top as well. Five minutes later she came outside and said that a table had just opened up and she could seat us. We agreed, and she led us to an upstairs area that was unseen before, that was HALF EMPTY! My mind was blown. Basically the hostess was either unorganized or too lazy to check on the status of her tables. A good meal was marred by a bad first impression."

This time the burger was overcooked, the meat chewy and greyish. The onion rings were soggy with grease. And I tried the Mac n Cheese which left me wondering, who stole my cheese?

Our first try of poutine. ( Fries with gravy and cheese. Otherwise known as the Montreal blood vessel clogger).  Best burgers we've had in years. We'll back next time we're in the area."

/user_details?userid=CN4sIAyAKFSPfX2AHAt3PQ,Carrie R.,"Cleveland, OH",3 star rating,"The Burger Bar has a rather extensive menu, which appealed to our group. We were seated immediately in their upstairs area, even though the restaurant wasn't very full. Unfortunately, that was about the last we saw of the wait staff. It took nearly 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order and almost another 10 before we received our drinks. In the 40 minutes it took to bring our food, our waitress never once came to check on us. When our food did come, it was delicious. Great sized portions, and perfectly cooked meat. I had the Babba Burger, and thoroughly enjoyed the stacked grilled veggies in my burger. I also appreciated that you are able to have a green salad, rather than fries. I usually don't care for hamburger buns, but these were delicious. Very hearty, and also grilled. Also a plus, I was very full after I finished. Poor service aside, I would say this is a good choice for dinner."
/user_details?userid=B43lamWLF3j2AamQ5a0w7g,Keeley-Ann H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is for sure over priced and the plating is not well figured out. Me and the BF got the popcorn chicken poutine. The chunks of cheese were cut so large that the gravy BARELY even softened them, i had to cut them up into smaller chunks so so i could get even bits of cheese to fries. And not to mention there were peas in them (did not state on the menu) and that was not good in the poutine, very bad texture and flavour with the rest of the food. Ive worked in restaurants and i know when its time to change your cooking oil, and they clearly do not. The popcorn chicken looked almost burnt and the fried were looking a little on the black side too. But the insides were fine, this means your oil is dirty and the crumbs and bits from other foods are refrying on your fresh food. NOT GOOD cause it ruins the texture and flavours. I was not down for the, mind you the portion sizes are good, i was def full after eating it (minus those peas)"
/user_details?userid=OM5ESgJqU50M0g7gigo4qA,mary f.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"We had a nice meal here sitting out on a small deck overlooking the scene on Crescent St. (which I liked a lot as opposed to being right on the street like some of the other places).  The food took awhile, which we were warned may be the case due to a private party upstairs.  We really didn't mind so much though because it was a nice night to be outside and the waitress kept checking on us to make sure we had whatever we needed.   There were a few specifically vegetarian items on the menu, one of which we ordered (the grilled portobello sandwich with grilled veggies).  Any of the burgers can be made with a veggie black bean patty instead, so we did that for another entree.  We had sweet potato fries with both which were great.  There was no kids menu per se, but they offered to make a small version of the mac and cheese.   I wouldn't say it's a great place to dine with kids because it's rather small and seemed quiet inside, but it worked out well for us being on the deck."
