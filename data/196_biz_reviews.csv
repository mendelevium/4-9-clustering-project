/user_details?userid=6Zx7YiKFYXwqWXQBqSxoYg,John G.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,What a wonderful dining experience. It's small and comfortable. 2 women were running the place and they nailed the service and the food. We started with one of the best pea soups I've ever had. Smooth and creamy with a hint of sweetness. The goat cheese and crushed croutons just upped it another notch. My son had the steak tartare with a huge pile of frites. The steak tartare had a nice zing from the vinaigrette. I stole some of the frites. I had a mushroom risotto dish that was just perfect. It wasn't heavy like many mushroom dishes.For dessert we shared a lemon/raspberry like custard that was much lighter than a custard. A special place!

There's not a lot on the menu, but that means they do everything very well, right? It was a quiet early Saturday night when we went so there was one server, one chef, and one dishwasher. We ordered a salmon tartar and duck tagliatelle and we watched the chef start immediately in their open kitchen. Flavours of both dishes were perfectly seasoned with great textures and complexity. Definitely would recommend coming to this restaurant and I wouldn't mind returning again to try their other dishes."

They have a simple menu but they get it right, the french cuisine. Flavors are balanced and married. Great variety on menu. The tartares are my go-tos. They are spot on well done and accompanied with generous sides portions"
/user_details?userid=ylpWc3hukBIHpGhqqboT5w,Maria A.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Dinner our first night in Montreal overall did not disappoint.  I came out feeling full but not stuffed.  Ordered the papperdalle with shrimp.  Good dish. I I don't like it when the description doesn't list all the ingredients so I was slightly disappointed when my dish came out with a large amount of green and red peppers. I like them but it's not my favorie veggie so I left a lot on the plate. Same thing with dessert- went with the cashew vanilla pot de creme. Tasty but also seemed to have oreo like cookies in it.  In my quest to get to the bottom of the mystery, I overate and got a little high on the sugar content. Our server was super nice.  He asked if we wanted to order in french or english. They had a nice patio to sit on and didn't chase us out of there when we were done.One friend ordered the burger with goat cheese for dinner and she said it was one of the top burgers she's ever had."
/user_details?userid=zsGH_1XyUxuP5O34WL6eLg,Jua P.,"Danville, CA",5 star rating,"What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!"
/user_details?userid=qcOBxbehz8U0BF6O9BfdVw,Wei W.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,This is such a great find - away from the old port tourist traps but within walking distance from everything. The food was the best we had in Montreal!
/user_details?userid=3tCcLoe116JPmLRivTNvyg,Joe C.,"Rockville, MD",4 star rating,Came here with my wife after she finished a work meeting at a nearby hotel. It is a nice bistro up the hill from Victoria square. Small and intimate with a young staff. We had the beef tartare and a side of frites. Both were excellent. We also ordered vodka and gin martinis which were surprisingly spot on with just a dash of vermouth. I recommend this place for a nice leisurely lunch.
/user_details?userid=hi2QC3mfH_VwNCB0Cs9_wQ,Ning C.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"What a nice little restaurant in the downtown Montreal.   I have Scallop with ratatuillie, my husband had veal with potatoes.  All very good and tasty.  Kids also enjoyed their Beef burger.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.   Will definitely come again if visit again Montreal."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I cant give a full review of the food at Albert (yet), simply because we came here for a glass of wine after work and only ordered some french fries to share. However, what I can say is that I really enjoyed the ambience and energy of this place. They have a great location with both in and outdoor seating.  The inside is comfortable and classy without being pretentious. Service was impeccable, friendly and very helpful in choosing the wines according to each of our preferences and very attentive to make sure we were never kept waiting for anything (even water refills).  The white wine we had there was delicious and refreshing and the french fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned and came with a little dipping sauce. My experience at Albert left a very good impression and after all the good reviews I am seeing on the food I will definitely come back for dinner and/or lunch in the near future. Great upscale spot for a date or to spend some time with friends."
/user_details?userid=o-qiZZpb9cKfRPynkA92Cg,David G.,"Kennesaw, GA",5 star rating,"With only 8 reviews there is always concern that the owners buddies got on Yelp and said good things. Buddies or not this place is fantastic. I must preface this by saying I had a 5 year old and a 10 year old with me - and I don't speak French. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The place is small, but had a nice intimate feel. The menu is limited, but the chef knows the product and the execution was perfect. This was not only my best meal in Montreal it was also probably the best value. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Go and enjoy."
/user_details?userid=uikNxEMWaVYl1Tng7PYc0w,K G.,"Cedar Park, TX",4 star rating,"A pleasant surprise!Walked around downtown Montreal looking for lunch, came across this place and two next door.  Picked this one on a lark and am very glad I did!  The Caprese Salad and Salmon Tartare were both incredibly delicious and fresh, coffee was strong, wait staff was nice and accommodating even though my French is non existent.  I am hoping to visit one more time before I leave the city again.No reservation but was able to sit at the bar."
/user_details?userid=775ArA9kf7oSw6THF_eOiQ,Susan B.,"Norfolk, MA",5 star rating,Neighborhood gem. Got flank steak. Came with grilled lettuce and fried mashed potato. Hub got burger. Fries amazing. Steak tender and well seasoned. Outside seating
/user_details?userid=svXKNbw-Ma4qJ6967NffCw,Robert C.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Albert Bistro is a hidden gem French Bistro in downtown Montreal. The food is top-notch and rivals any top rated Michelin restaurant. We were greeted by the owner Lucy, who gave us some excellent suggestions. She then turned us over to a first-class server named Kevin. If you're looking for excellent  food prepared with great care, go no further."
/user_details?userid=HIFBUVosyu_JdODItIhJdA,Stephanie M W.,"Menlo Park, CA",5 star rating,"Visiting from the Finger Lakes, NY region......and happened upon Albert Bistro! Wow what a treat! Service was exceptional! Tartare incredible! Fish special.....yum.....scallops and ratatouille with cashews. Ever bite great. Terrific wine by the glass too! Go!"
/user_details?userid=Cbv9M1zL29rjVFFhbGTpiQ,Elizabeth B.,"Maplewood, NJ",3 star rating,"It started off very promising - the waiter was extremely helpful.  Turns out the omelette is only offered at lunch (so why is it on the dinner menu?).  He went off to the kitchen, the chef agreed to make the omelette, and it was delicious!He also helped us choose an excellent wine by allowing us to taste test two reds.After delivering our food he disappeared and through the window we could see him and the other staff doing shots with a group of customers.  I saw at least three rounds of shots.  Eventually another staff member brought our check.We enjoyed our food, but the service was, to say the least, disappointing."
/user_details?userid=QMeZrGPwIbQL8nKYOjhsrA,Claudia C.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is delicious. It's packed during lunch time with office workers in the surrounding areas. During dinner hours, it's considerably more quiet. I got the salmon tar tar for $24 and it was totally worth it. It came with crackers and a large salad. I was full but not the heavy type of full. I think I'm going to try Albert salad with the poached eggs next time."
/user_details?userid=seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg,Stéphanie S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I give very few ""5 stars"" to my reviews but this one is totally worth it! We came here for this year's edition au ""MTL à Table"" and it was partly just luck as we tried to find one good table that was available the same night. As you might expect, a lot where fully booked but we manage to get the last table here... and for 5 people.The place is small and hugely popular at lunch time, you'll only get here at that time with a reservation and you should reserve at night as well.What can you expect? A great bistro experience without the attitude. Our server was one of the co-owner (Audrey, I believe) and her service was perfect and on top of that, since she's an owner, is able to offer special wines not yet on the wine list (she told us that all their wines are by private importation).Among out group of five was my 18 years old son who had an issue with the main courses offered on the set menu for ""MTL à table"" and it was the only menu available that night. The option was either a fish, scallops or beef tartare none of which he wanted to eat. Despite that, our server/owner was able to negotiation with the chef and find a delicious ad-hoc replacement for our son.I don't usually eat cooked food but I made an exception for the scallops dish which were described as ""Roasted scallops - Browned butter butternut squash puree, speculoos, coffee infused veal jus, aragula salad"" and I don't regret trying. The mix was delicious and the plate very generous with a good count of large scallops. The only reserve that I have is that it was a bit generous on the ""fleur de sel"".The ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxed and friendly which I believe mirror the personally of the owners. The choice of the ""antique multi filaments"" light bulbs just by itself create a relaxed and cozy setting. They also have a terrace outside for those days where Montreal's climate is not too brutal.The warmth of the bistro and it's staff along with great food and reasonable prices makes for a winning combinaison and a place where you want to come back and bring some friend so they can experience it as well. No wonder the place have quickly became so popular!"
/user_details?userid=gs2-FMX_wUSbZe-ER7llYQ,Bev L.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,Not sure why there aren't more reviews because this is a really excellent restaurant.  We had both chef's specials - seafood was scallops and meat was a bavette steak with gnocchi- both excellent.  Also had the entrees of heirloom tomatoes with burrata and a cold melon soup which were also fresh and tasty.  Nice wine by the glass and a couple of beers .  Friendly service and quiet cozy atmosphere plus a few outdoor tables.   Definitely worth a visit.
/user_details?userid=liDCdnmXuOr4kKfsCVU84w,Gina L.,"Belmont, MA",5 star rating,"This place was great!! The drinks were good and the chef's special appetizer with shrimp and basil was fantastic! We had the burger, which was delicious, the veal steak, and the paperedelle.  My husband raved about the burger, the veal was perfectly seasoned and tender with something like fried mashed potatoes (very interesting and good) and a chimichurri sauce, our daughter had the paperedelle and this was also amazing ( I am definitely going to attempt this at home). Everything was outstanding, including the service.  At the end, the chef gave us, on the house, the best churros I have ever had! I definitely recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=Rh0sY0YiQ41hiuPNx3Bhig,Julia T.,"Watertown, MA",5 star rating,"This place is outstanding. Friendly staff whom do not hover but make sure you are all set, absolutely delicious food and a good drink selection. I had the chef's special which happened to be filet mignon with greens and potatoes.  It was so good I honestly wanted to go back a second night during our trip. 10/10 - we'll be back during our next visit to Montreal."
