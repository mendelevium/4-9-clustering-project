The place is a little small and can get crowded so if you want to check this place out I would go at an odd time or you may need to wait in line. Or if you don't want to dine in, you can get it to go. They had different options of smoked meat if you want it more fatty or lean. The fries were great and you could get a pickle which pairs well with the fried/fatty food. The only thing is this place only takes cash which is a bit of a downside, as you'll need to make sure you have cash handy! All in all if you're visiting Montreal or just looking for some good smoked meat, this is a go to!"

Literally tastes exactly like what you get at the restaurant, minus the long lines!! Price is very fair, and the quality of the food is unbeatable. So. Worth. It."
/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I must add a disclaimer to this review since I've been eating at Schwartz's for over 50 years. There have been times while eating there, my medium-lean sandwich was not up to snuff (and I've never ever had an issue getting it replaced) but the medium-lean sandwiches we had on July 31 were melt in your mouth tender and it was the Schwartz's that I remember since I was a kid. It was 6:30 pm walked into a nearly deserted restaurant that we've never seen so dead. Every other table was removed for social distancing. Everyone was wearing masks. Plexiglass all along the counters. As soon as customers got up, the table and chairs were all disinfected. The food quickly came out hot and fresh. Both sandwiches were excellent, fries were decent and pickle was perfectly sour. No condiments on the tables, waiter brought them to you. AFAIC, other than modifications to the restaurant layout due to Covid-19, the only difference from 7/31/2020 compared to my childhood memories is a tenfold increase in price -- and now poutine is on the menu ‍"

(P.S.: You can choose fatty over lean, or vice versa -- your call.)"
/user_details?userid=3VLcNOmumPkwuSoQxTBHTw,Marc I.,"Ajax, Canada",5 star rating,Is there anything better that a true Smoked meat sandwich?  This place is a Montreal staple and one that everyone should try.   mmmm. Only issue is the line ups to get in.   Definitely get there early and be prepared to wait in line to get in. Food was extremely satisfying and portions were decent.   Will be back but best to come in off peak hours.
/user_details?userid=rp9ee4JmMVLkW6U2Qa1dlA,Vy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,This place opens late hours and so close to Montreal University. The night life here is so fun with a lot of restaurants and bars open. This is the first place I visited after arriving to Montreal (as I was really hungry then! ) This is one of the signature dishes of Canada that you must try. I ordered 3 sandwiches with different meats and all of them are good.
/user_details?userid=sBjpUbgILjlck5BD-flF9Q,Angela L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Came here to of course try the smoke meat sandwich. Also shared poutine with a friend. I suggest you just skip the fries TBH. They were not that great. However, the sandwich was delicious. The meat was so juicy and tender. They keep their sandwiches pretty simple, all you're getting is meat, bread and some mustard, usually not my style but that's all this needed.You may have to wait a while to be seated. When I got there, there were 5 to 6 parties ahead of me and it took about 15 minutes to get seated so that's not bad. So I guess if there's more than 10 parties, you might be waiting a while. The block that this restaurant is located on has other places to try out if that's the case"

/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had Schwartz for take out the other day and we ordered the smoked meat sandwich. We actually ordered from two delis to compare the different smoked meat sandwiches from Schwartz's competitors, and it was a tie. Schwartz's sandwich is quite tasty, and the meat itself was a bit fatty, which added to the juiciness and tenderness of the sandwich. Schwartz's pickle was delicious and very satisfying! Would recommend, especially given that it's a Montreal staple."
/user_details?userid=xh84BlvTytrjuyOkSyevHg,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Skip the main line and order to-go! The line moves much faster and there's actually some tables in the back where you can quickly scarf down your sandwich and mosey on out. Though there was a line for the lunch rush even in the to-go section, we were in and out in less than 30 mins.We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches, one medium fat, one medium lean, and honestly they looked at tasted like two different sandwiches. Lean is chewier and less oily, as the name implies, the fat is more tender. The mustard was tasty and the servings of meat were generous. The cherry soda is VERY sweet. Pairs well with the sandwich but be careful if you're not a fan of super sugary drinks."
/user_details?userid=72GC_nR68n0bzPDSCcErwQ,Aiko S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I have been to Montreal many times and while I had heard so many great things about Schwartz's, I was never that interested in checking it out and the restaurant was never on my priority list. It wasn't until last month when I finally made the trip to New York's pastrami institution Katz's Deli for the first time since moving to NYC almost ten years ago that I finally convinced myself to visit Schwartz's on my next trip to Montreal. Compared to the experience at Katz's you'll find the experience at Schwartz's to be much more laid back. Although my friend who is a Montreal local had warned me about the long lines and the grimy counters at Schwartz's, it was nothing compared to the queue or the griminess at Katz's. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was no line when I got there around 1pm on a weekday and was immediately seated at the counter by a friendly staff member. I was also happy to see that the counters and tables had been wiped down before being seated because that's definitely not the experience that you get at Katz's since they are always super busy. My smoked meat sandwich was ready within a matter of minutes after being seated. As with Katz's the sandwich looked massive with clumps of meat sticking out, but the meat is very tender so it's not as heavy as it looks and the sandwich is quite manageable even for one person. As soon as I took a bite out of it I wondered why it had taken me so long to make it out to Schwartz's. It was the same feeling that went through my head when I first took a bite out of my pastrami sandwich at Katz's. As of February 2020, Schwartz's is cash only although they do take Canadian debit cards and US dollars. If you're paying in US dollars you will be charged 20% more than if you were to pay in Canadian dollars, but considering that the smoked meat sandwich here is less than half  the price of the pastrami or reuben sandwiches at Katz's, paying that extra 20% will still make the sandwich at Schwartz's pretty affordable. If you want to pay in Canadian dollars, but don't have any cash on you, there is an ATM  machine at the back of the store although the ATM will charge fee of 1.50 Canadian dollars. Just as Katz's is a New York institution that everyone should visit at least once, Schwartz's is also an institution that every meat lover should try in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's the place on the must go list for tourists in Montreal and there are often long lines in winter and summer. In my personal opinion, it's an okay place for a smoked meat sandwich. It's worth trying if you are in the area and if you want to avoid lines, I would recommend to go either around 5-6 on a Monday or Tuesday night, it seems to be less crowded to me."
/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Daniel B.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Five stars. This place lived up to the hype, at least for us it did. The smoked meat was terrific and service by our server, Bahram, was outstanding. Prices were reasonable. We enjoyed the entire experience.Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen is a famous deli in Montreal. It's an institution; the oldest deli in Canada, opened in 1928. It's perhaps the most popular place to eat at in the city. It's old school, cash only, and reminds me of Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan. Like Katz's, Schwartz's is a Jewish kosher-style deli. Unlike Katz's, Schwartz's is known for their Montreal-style smoked meat, not pastrami. They're both good, but I like Schwartz's better, not only in terms of food, but in terms of service and atmosphere too. The people are nicer here.From what I've heard and seen, there's usually a line out the door for this place. It's not very big and this is the only location. I guesstimate the restaurant can seat maybe 90-100 customers tops between the dining room tables and the bar. They pack people in. The seating is communal, so if there's just two or three or four of you, you'll most likely be seated together with strangers. Prepare to get cozy.Our group of seven was lucky. We showed up to Schwartz's on a Friday at 11:21am and were seated immediately at an eight-top. It was busy. Almost every seat was taken. When we left, shortly after 12pm, there was a line down the sidewalk to get in. We came at the right time that day.The wall menu above the bar is presented in both French and English and there are helpful pictures too. People come here for the smoked meat, but Schwartz's also sells chicken, liver, turkey, and salami too. The prices are affordable. The total bill for our group of seven guys, after taxes, was only $115.20 Canadian (or $16.46 per person Canadian). And we had leftovers.Here's what we got (all dollars Canadian):* 3 Grande Assiete - large plates of smoked meat ($17.95 each)* 2 Frite - fries ($7.10 each)* 1 Poutine ($6.50)* 2 Salade de Choux - coleslaw ($3.40 each)* 2 Cornichon - French pickles ($2.35 each)* 3 Cerise Noire - Cott black cherry soda ($2.95 each)* 4 Liqueur - soft drinks like Diet Coke ($2.60 each)* 1 Fraise Partage ($2)The smoked meat was amazing. It's smoked beef brisket. Bahram told us Schwartz's smoked meat is cured and marinated for 10 days and then smoked for 8 hours. According to the menu, the meat is prepared with Schwartz's ""secret blend of herbs and spices"" and smoked daily. You can request slices of meat from lean to fat. We ordered our meat at medium-fat content. I think that's definitely the way to go because our meat was delectable in both taste and texture.Each slice was tender, rich, and flavorful. Plates of sliced rye bread accompanied the meats so we made our own sandwiches. If you don't want to commit to a plate of meat, you can order a single smoked meat sandwich for $10.45. I prepared my smoked meat sandwich with coleslaw and mustard with pickles on the side. It was incredibly delicious. It made me happy. The pickles are served whole and are thick and tart. We cut them up into slices to share.The fries and poutine were tasty. While Schwartz's poutine wasn't as ""smothered"" as other poutines we had in Montreal were (particularly those in Old Montreal), it was still quite good and I recommend ordering it. Schwartz's version is simple and traditional -- fries, cheese curds, brown gravy; that's it, none of that extra stuff. It may have been my favorite poutine on our trip actually. The fries were hot, golden brown, and crispy; medium thickness.If you come to Schwartz's, you have to have your smoked meat sandwich with a Cerise Noire or Cott black cherry soda to drink. It's a tradition. In 2018, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported about 50% of Schwartz's customers drink a Cott black cherry soda with their smoked meat sandwich: cbc.ca/news/canada/montr…. Schwartz's gives you a glass of ice with your can of soda.Bahram was a delight. We were fortunate to have him as our server. He was very friendly and pleasant. Not only did he describe Schwartz's food to us, but he also pointed out various celebrity customers in the pictures on the wall (after I asked him about a photo of him with Seth Rogen). Many celebrities have come to eat here and most are shown off on the wall which is just filled with photographs, autographs, and newspaper and magazine clippings. I sat next to one of my friends who sat exactly where Chris Rock sat when Chris Rock ate here.You can pay at the table or at the register. As mentioned above, this place is cash only. If you don't have cash and don't want to use the restaurant's ATM, there are banks within two blocks on St Laurent.There are two small restrooms inside, one for men and one for ladies.Schwartz's should be on any Montreal visitor's to-do list. Even our pescatarian friend joined us and had a good time."
/user_details?userid=RoO8V10M8wLrJT-JnuNVig,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,If you have ever been to Katz Delicatessen in NYC this place is comparable to it! My friends and I decided to give this place a try and got the smoked meat sandwich to share. The meat was both lean and fatty. Our biggest mistake was not doing our research and realizing that there was a take out spot for Schwartz's right next door AFTER our meal...The tables in this establishment are incredibly close to one another. It made it really hard for people to get in and out and there was no flow of traffic for customers trying to get in and out. This cramped environment made it hard for someone who's claustrophobic to truly enjoy the full experience.
/user_details?userid=eSQjVZew9qqcN2g8X1zE9A,Nina E.,"Iowa City, IA",5 star rating,"Giant pickle: DAMN!!!Smoked meat, mustard. It's not ham.The fries too? They slam.Schwartz's has some serious hype behind it. Like every ""amazing"" restaurant, I'm always hesitant that the fame will have gotten itself entrenched into the food so deeply that any remnants of reality will be lost. Schwartz's is as real as food gets. It's unapologetically itself: the fries are so greasy, the smoked meat is piled too high to properly eat, and the cherry cola has way too many sugar cubes dissolved inside to be considered legal by many foodie standards. The servers are people, with personalities and quips, and will give you any attitude you give them right back. And you know what? Schwartz's provides the best meal in Montreal. We can't wait to come back."
/user_details?userid=oHZwAtzy8LaIdq-dSgGruA,Lysha L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Atmosphere/Service: This place was so packed and busy when we went. There was a line through the door leading outside. I remember the last time I was here, the same thing happened so I wasn't surprised. But luckily the line went fast, and if you go with a party of two or less the wait time isn't that bad. It's when you go with a party of 4 or more when it's harder to grab a seat. The servers were also super nice but a bit pushy as the turnover time here is usually 20 mins or so.Menu/food: Most people who come here know that ordering the smoked meat is where it's at. Everything else is outsourced, and the only thing made in store is the smoked meat. You can get the sandwich made ready to eat, or platter wise where you'd make your own sandwiches, and easier to share. Food was so good. The meat were all lean and as salty and savoury as can be. i'm not usually a pickle person, but their dill pickle is a definite must!Overall: love the place! Recommend it for a fast eat in Montreal. even if you don't have time, just go next door where their take out options are!"
/user_details?userid=9daiDT6xt39HW5pnjzy2bg,Wendy H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I always love coming back to this place for smoked meat sandwiches. Service was fast and we got our order pretty quick. I wish that our meat was hotter. It seemed pretty cold when we were served it. We ordered a lean meat sandwich each. They charge $2 if guests share dishes instead of ordering their own. They only accept debit and cash. Place is pretty small and not recommended to bring in a lot of personal belongings.

He winked at me and 2 mins later gave me a lean-semi fat sandwich and became my new best friend. I bought two 4 gallon pepper jars when I left. Get the peppers. I love this place.

/user_details?userid=VHx_sO7IxZvY3Hnf3-xq9Q,Nina Z.,"East Bay, CA",5 star rating,"Yes, yes, and YES! If you're in Montreal, you've got to go to Schwartz for their famous Montreal smoked meat sandwich. For those who don't know, Montreal is famous for their smoked meat. It is made using beef brisket cured with spices and seasoning for about a week to allow for flavor absorption. The meat is then smoked, steamed, and packed between two slices of light rye bread with mustard slathered on. In addition, with smoked meat, there's different levels of fattiness you can choose from. The sandwich may look small at first, but they really pack it. The smoked meat was so tender, moist, fatty, flavorful with a slight smokiness to it. It was honestly one of the best things I ate on the trip. If you're looking for local flavor, this is the place to be. I recommend calling ahead of time for takeout, because from what I've heard and seen, there's always a line out of the door."

The smoked meat sandwich is so tender and packed with flavor! It comes on rye bread and slathered with mustard, if I'm being honest, items I don't particularly care for, but IT WORKS! Oh man, the bread complimented the meat and the mustard blends in so well. I couldn't believe how good it was! Makes my mouth water as we speak!Like I said, don't wait in the long line, go to the deli counter and take the sandwich to go, no waiting! The people behind the counter have that sandwich whipped up in no time! They have some stools and a counter in the back, where you can eat, or you can go across the street and eat in the cute painted storage container. They offer various souvenirs, of which I took home some seasoning and also take credit cards.Worth the hype and your time!! Check it out!"

No complaints, but not something I'd make a special trip for again. The place seems to attract quite a few tourists (myself one of them) given it's a long time establishment. Only complaint I had was about the rudeness of the man at the register. I get it, you're dealing with tourists all day long, but isn't it human decency to be pleasant to one another?Be warned, they accept Canadian cash only ! There is an atm machine in the back of the restaurant though."

So that is exactly what we did!We came around 3:00 and there was essentially no line up although we saw a food group finishing up so we must of just missed the rush we thought! We were seated right away and the server was incredibly friendly. We received our food within minutes! We both ordered a smoked Montreal ""medium"" meat sandwich. Let me tell you, once I took a bite into this amazingness that is a sandwich, I was hooked! I ate it up so fast and I did add slightly more mustard. Now, it is recommended that you complete the experience with a cherry cola but I just can't stand cherry cola but my husband ordered it. He did make a comment it does taste great with it.A must stop for sure!"

Maybe 20 minutes?The inside is a bit cramped and a hole in the wall, which is to be expected since it's such a long-term establishment.Each of us ordered a smoked meat sandwich (of course!) and my Montreal friend said that the pickles were a must. We also shared a plate of fries. This ended up being way too much food for us - we could've went without the fries or the pickles, especially considering that they were only 'aite. But that's not what we came for anyway!The smoked meat sandwich came with a heaping mountain of smoke beef brisket. And oh my, it was an amazing mountain of meat. It was tender, flavourful, juicy.. and I ate it all, despite it being way too much food.Considering the quality of the sandwich I got, I was quite happy. A great way to end a trip to Montreal!"

If you've been to Katz's in NYC or Langers in Los Angeles you'll know what I mean. More like a Pastrami sandwich then brisket, we ordered one lean and one medium fatty (but when they came I saw no difference). It wasn't horrible but nothing to make a special trip for. The price was a lot lower than in New York - I'll give them that. The g/f tried the turkey sandwich which was made withheap, processed turkey -- a crime to be served at a famous deli. French Fries were on the greasy side. I literally have nothing to recommend here -- even the service wasn't good and our server was rude (maybe he used to work in New York? )Check the hours before you come as Yelp stated they opened at 9am on Sundays -- we went recently and they open at 10am. Not sure about other days. I've alerted Yelp to the mistake -- hope they change the hours as we waited 45 minutes for them to open (another mistake)."

As a NJ/NY native, this place definitely lived up to the expectations of having delicious smoked meat sandwiches, and the interior is super humble. The walls are lined with different posters and magazine covers, as well as little models of Schwartz's itself. I also like the layout of multiple long tables, since you can just sit and chill alongside other tourists and natives enjoying themselves.The only thing that hurt my experience was the service. Upon entering, our waiter was pretty curt, which was understandable because it's such a busy place. But when I wanted to ask my waiter what people usually got, he got frustrated with me and didn't answer my question! I was taken aback, since I didn't think it'd be that uncommon of an inquiry. Anyways, I'm definitely willing to come back, but maybe I'll just grab my sammy to go next time."
/user_details?userid=49sNJ1cHVRW4ao2tAUL9Ng,Heather O.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Is it a touristy spot? Yes. Are the lines long? Yes. Was the sandwich everything I didn't know I needed? YES. We visited Montreal for the first time over the weekend, and as someone from Philly who understands sandwich hype, particular when it comes to meat, (here's looking at you Philly cheesesteaks and Katz's Deli in NYC), I was expecting this to be an over-hyped institution. I'm generally not a fan of salty foods and lean meat, so I was wondering if this was going to be comparable to a pastrami. The line was long, and our time was limited. Thankfully, next door to the restaurant, Schwartz's has a take out option where there was no wait. You can order limited items there and seat yourself in the back. We ordered one sandwich to split, and we ordered two pounds of hot smoked meat to go. The meat was melt in your mouth, a bit fatty, not overly seasoned, perfectly paired with some simple rye bread and mustard. It doesn't get any simpler or delectable than this. We regretted splitting a sandwich and contemplated on purchasing one more. This was the most delicious sandwich I've had in such a long time. If you watch any videos/interviews about this place, it really isn't about the bread or any typical fare you would put on a sandwich, the meat is the star."

/user_details?userid=0IwZb1ePNpSVYcCdMtGoQw,Cindy D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,I have never had smoked meat before and was really excited to try it as the people I was travelling with raved a lot about this place. We opted to take out rather than sit in because the line to sit in was longer and I was sure it would take longer to to get seats for. The line for takeout was not that long so that was good. We got the smoked meat sandwich and it was really really REALLY good! The mustard went so well with the meat and the amount of meat you get is beyond what I expected. You get a mouthful of that tender meat in every single bite and it gives that you satisfaction. We also got some meat in containers to bring it back. I would love to come back here!

They tell you to come here to try out their legendary ""Smoked Meat"" sandwich. Well, I did and here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right off of a busy street in what seemed like a college town is this gem. It seems to always be busy in here so if you come in the likelihood of being sat with complete strangers is pretty high. There's nothing wrong with that though. The benches are designed to hold a total of 6 people and there's a decent amount of seating at the bar as well. You can't hang out in here after eating. If you aren't stuffing your face and are just chatting, you'll get asked to leave because a line forms quickly outside. Rude, but I guess that's a part of the aura here. Eat and go. There isn't much decor, just a bunch of memorabilia from celebrities who have visited and stuff.Service: Pretty awesome actually. I forget his name, but he was bald, spoke very good English and knew how to make people laugh. He seemed to be the ""face"" of the restaurant since he did most of the talking and order-taking. I mean, we got our waters and stuff, but it's not a 5-star restaurant so don't expect to be ""waited on"".Food: Very, very good. I had their legendary ""Smoked Meat Sandwich"" and a side of coleslaw. The sandwich was smaller than I expected so you're going to want a side. The food was impressive and I do see all of the hype surrounding Schwartz's.Value: CASH ONLY. I don't like that the restaurant doesn't tell you that until your food is practically in your lap and that was only because I noticed a sign above the cashier's desk. I mean, maybe I wasn't paying attention, but yeah. Of course there's an ATM in the back you can use but they don't take cards at all. CASH ONLY.Pretty decent spot, but I think I'm all set with my 1 visit here. The only reason I'd come back is to pre-order their duck that they literally go out and hunt for you. Lol. You have to put in and pay for an order a few days in advance then they notify you when your duck (that you order by the pound) is ready. So I'm still interested in that, but we shall see."

New Yorkers might be quick to compare this place to Katz's, but given that the process of their dry-cured meats are somewhat different, it's a tough comparison.I always recommend the counter experience, since the guys behind the counter are super friendly. They also have a number of tables, but every time I've come here it's been too crowded to nab one. It's a little on the narrow side and since this place is frequented by tourists and some locals, there is never a slow time. I don't mind waiting personally, the aroma of the meats keeps me happy.The menu here is very simple. Buy the meat by the pound or have it in sandwich form. When going with takeout, I usually buy a couple pounds of their pastrami and eat it (happily) later. When dining in, I'm all about the sandwich and a side of poutine. Some folks would prefer a pickle and coleslaw, but the fries are a better option in my opinion.The brisket here is nice and succulent. For a dry-cured meat, I have to say there is a certain kind of moist and airy bite. I appreciate the mustard in the sandwich, but the pastrami on its own is worth its weight in meat sweats. It also is a great group meal option, as long as everyone is a carnivore.The staff couldn't be nicer. I expected a bit of pushiness my first time here but have received exemplary service each time. On occasion they pack the pastrami so tight in the container that it easily weighs more than the amount I paid for. I fully intend on being back soon!"

I heard people trying to say ""no mustard"" or our table even asked for hot water.. both things not on the menu. To the ""no mustard"" response, waiter says ""you could try other things on the menu."" To the hot water, waiter says no we don't have that but then when I order the tea it literally is a cup of hot water with a tea bag on the side. 2) Seating is limited, so most likely you'll be seated with some strangers. Our table ended up being Chinese and my dad bonded with the folks at our table as we were finishing. It was packed already at 11:17pm, people waiting. 3) smoked meat is delicious! Straight up, nothing else. Heated warm in case anyone is wondering.4) Payment!! Shit. Didn't realize they don't take credit card or debit card. They only accept Canadian dollar and Canadian debit.  they charge 20% extra for USD"

Ordered the half pound hot smoked meat beef and a couple pickles. The smoked beef was nicely seasoned and smoked. Took off some of the best part of the meat -the fat to ensure that I don't get a clogged heart. If you want to dine in you can guarantee a line to wait so have a friend ready to wait in line while another finds parking. Need to try the chicken next time.

This old school deli has been serving up Montreal-style smoked meat since 1928 and is a staple in the city. The line was out the door on a Thursday evening and bustling with locals & tourists. When it got to us, we all decided on the medium (mix of lean x fatty) smoked meat sandwich; it came with a mountain of smoked brisket piled high between two slices of rye bread and a bit of mustard. Simple but very well done. The meat was flavorful and tender with a touch of smokiness. The rye bread held up well and balanced the savouriness. The mustard gave a nice zing to the dish. Between Katz in New York and Schwartzs, I think I prefer Schwartzs more. It's also much more reasonably priced. Overall, 4.5 stars."

Upon entry, you can feel the history of this restaurant and the outlay is like a 19th century deli. We decided to line up and go for the take-out option and while the line seems long at first, it really moves faster than you'd expect. I'd say we waited about 20 minutes which isn't bad. The sandwich itself was incredible but make sure to check they've put enough mustard in it! They're operating fast and can sometimes forget to load up every sandwich with the same amount. Size-wise the sandwich was smaller than expected so you should order more if you're looking for more than a snack. The smoked meat was tender, delicious and very flavourful.Overall a must-try for the smoked meat. They only take Cash and Debit only, no credit."

It's awesome. Very awesome. First, expect a jam-packed restaurant and a line. We came at 9 pm on a Tuesday ... still a line!Second: Get EVERYTHING! The Cole Slaw is crisp and perfectly vinegary. The pickle is the biggest, juiciest one I've had outside NYC (cut it ... eating by hand will invariably lead to a river of pickle juice down your sleeve). The fries are crisp and so good condiments are superfluous.Smoked meat is a must! Three options: lean, medium, and fatty. I had medium, my wife had fatty ... both were amazing. She had hers as part of a combo plate with a lean, perfect steak, with Schwartz's rightfully famous blend. I had mine as a sandwich, stuffed high with a perfect amount of mustard.We came, we saw, we ate ... and it was amazing."
/user_details?userid=310zgwPQRoe63E1pzzMVPA,Steve A.,"Boonton, NJ",4 star rating,"There is no smoked meat quite like Schwartz's. What they say is true. The downside is you are paying tourist prices for tourist quantities. The locals clearly keep coming for that quality but it's tough to justify $11 for a tiny sandwich and $9 for a moderately sized poutine with not quite enough curds. On the other hand, $10 for the poutine à la Schwartz comes smothered in smoked meat and is a much better but. If I return, I would probably buy a pound of meat and maker my own sandwiches for cheaper. Very strong 4 stars for now.Pro tip: Pickles are all natural. Pick a pickle if you choose."

Being from New York, gives me a good base for comparison. You certainly don't come to a place like this for service. Although in NYC, service isn't too bad. First impressions, as we walked in a nice girl told us we can sit anywhere we'd like. Once further in, a man, who seemed to be working there forever, maybe a boss, told us rudely barked at us to sit down and the way we had to sit. We couldn't sit next to each other. Wouldn't recommend talking to him. (Picture of him enclosed.)Food... Well it wasnt terrible. But it was certainly nothing to write home about. This smoked meet is basically somewhere between a Pastrami and Corned beef. Taste-wise, it was a bit bland. Texture was crumbly at best. The meat just didn't hold together too well. It's important for the meat to be Tender and at least hold it's shape. Tender it wasn't, it was just more dry than anything. The amount of mustard on it was skimpy. We also ordered a pickle. It a sour pickle, was pretty good. No other option of pickles. I guess I'm too used to NYC where we can easily get at least 3 different options. I prefer a ""new pickle"" with my smoked meat sandwich. Coleslaw in the fridge looked old and yellow, so decided not to get that.In short, my humble opinion is, any random Jewish deli place in New York will blow this place out of the water easily. It'll be like a Lambo racing a Camry.Come to experience this place if you'd like. May the Schwartz be with you...... =/"

And Schwartz's did not disappoint. I showed up around 5 PM on a Thursday evening, hoping to beat the dinner rush. While the place was quite busy, there was not yet a line out the door and being alone meant that I could snag a seat at the counter immediately. Surprisingly, I was greeted in English both at the door and by the person taking my order. Don't tell the OQLF!For my meal, I ordered the classic: the small smoked meat plate,medium, with a black cherry to drink. About 5 minutes later, I had at least half a pound of smoked goodness in front of me, along with stack of rye bread. I quickly made it into a sandwich and dug in. And holy crap was it good. The meat melted in my mouth. It was far better than I could have ever imagined. I was still somewhat full from that day's lunch, so I ended up leaving about half of the meat on the plate. Don't worry- I brought that back to the hotel and reheated it for my ""dessert"" that night. No way in heck was I going to let any meat go to waste.""If the meat was so good, why only 4 stars?"" you might ask. Well, a couple reasons. For one, it's a tad pricey compared to some of the other regional smoked meat places. You're paying inflated tourist prices. But IMO, it's worth the added cost. The other thing (which grinds my gears a little bit) is that the place is cash only, which there is no mention of until you're at the register with a credit card out to pay (the sign above says ""CASH"" with a US exchange rate, but not ""cash only"").Sure, there are other smoked meat places in Montréal. But if you want the best, go to Schwartz's. You might have to wait, but it's worth the wait. Just remember to bring cash to pay the bill."

BUT nothing could've been further from the truth, even though there weren't too many smiles, they were sweethearts, and very helpful!!When I started ordering the waiter basically told me to slow my roll, I was ordering a lot of food.  Most joints would want you to order as much as they could sell you, but this guy helped us get the order right and he said 'if you're still hungry, we can always order more'. Now I think, no I'm sure, this guy was shocked at the amount of food I put away, he said I might have to put your picture on the wall. On to the food. I had been told by my cousin in Vancouver that Montreal Smoked meat is 10x better than Pastrami, he's got it twisted, in my world of food the ranking goes 1) Caviar, 2) Foie Gras, and 3) Pastrami- in that order, and everything else, well it doesn't really matter. Schwartz's ranks between Pastrami and Corned-beef. It's DAMN GOOD. I have had better Pastrami, but this hangs with the best. The slaw was fantastic, get it!!!!  The dill pickles were amazing and so were the fries. Got the black cherry cola, very good.

A little pricey for what it is...I came here on a Sunday with a friend. After a 10 minute wait, we were seated inside which isn't unusual for such a known place. As previously stated, I got the smoked meat sandwich with a pickle and soda. The smoked meat was really good. Very tasty, with lots of flavour. It was however somewhat greasy. But, it is expected on such a fatty sandwich. As for the rye, it seemed to fall apart after taking a couple bites out of it. Possibly due to the grease or mustard. The rye was really good and fresh tasting though. The pickle was really good too. It was sour and crunchy, and quite large. However, I was expecting the sandwich to come with one included. I was hesitant to get a pickle due to the price (close to $3 for a single pickle), but for a smoked meat sandwich, it's a must. As for the soft drink, my only comment is that the price point is quite high for such a cheap one. I remember it used to be sold at the dollar store for $0.33 cents per can... (priced at close to $3). Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is very delicious and quite filling. However, at it's current price point, I would advise going once in a while."

We opted for the take out, since that line was much shorter (and involved an indoor wait).We ordered 1.5 pounds of the smoked meat and one smoked meat sandwich. The hot smoked meat sandwich was good. The pastrami was crumbly, slightly juicy, somewhat fatty, had some mustard and in between two slices of white bread. The pastrami was definitely drier than Katz or Pastrami Queen in NY. The box of smoked meat was not so great. There were slices of smoked meat congealed in the box. It tasted like smoked corned beef, it was sinewy and chewy and not melt in your mouth.

Came here by myself and the line to get in was huge and out the door to the corner. Luckily by me being by myself, I was jumped all the way ahead to one seat at the counter. For my food I had the go to and that is the Montreal smoked meat sandwich. The sandwich isn't big but taste excellent, great, and every other wonderful thing to say. The cut of the meat reminds  me of a bread basket sandwich back home in the metro Detroit area. Just perfect is the sandwich. Along with the sandwich, I had some of their poutine. It's was ok, nothing special to me. I believe it's cash only and it's just a great old throwback deli. Another must have if you come to Montreal."

Not sure when we will be back in Montreal but it's definitely a place to eat when you are in town!  I highly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,Joy B.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"The star of the show here is the spiced and brined beef brisket, hot-smoked and steamed, yielding something similar to corned beef or pastrami but taking it a step further. Jews from Eastern European introduced the smoked meat sandwich to Montreal nearly a century ago, and one of the main vendors of this specialty is the legendary Schwartz's Deli.A smoked meat sandwich comes piled high with slices of hand-cut meat served on fresh rye bread with yellow mustard. Unlike pastrami which uses leaner parts of the brisket, smoked meat includes the fatty parts of the muscle. You can specify your cut when ordering as lean, medium, or fatty. Faced with this question recent visions of foie gras and poutine danced in my head. This was no time to start showing restraint in a city that shows no restraint, gastronomically speaking. Fatty it was! As expected the meat was tender and juicy and complemented by the grainy spice of the yellow mustard slathered to both sides of the bread. The flavor of the meat was new and different to me, no surprise when you consider the week-long curing process it undergoes in a blend of whole peppercorns, coriander, mustard seed, and garlic, among other secret ingredients. Sides to enjoy with this meaty goodness include frites maison (house fries), cornichon (pickle), and salade de choux (coleslaw). The coleslaw was greener and tangier than traditional American coleslaw, being dressed with vinegar instead of globs of mayonnaise. The fries were thick and generously salted but there were definitely inconsistencies in the texture, with some of the fries being overly soggy and limp.Almost as famous as Schwartz's smoked meat is the perpetual line out the door, which we were fortunate enough to avoid. Eating dinner at senior citizen times can have its benefits. The ten minutes we did spend waiting outside were a chance to point and laugh at people who can't park. Inside the experience felt like a visit to Nate 'n Al except you're packed like sardines at family-style picnic tables and you're nowhere near Beverly Hills. Counter seating is also available where you can witness the meat-cutting process in all its juicy, savory glory.By the time you leave, you and your clothes are thoroughly scented of meat. It's an aroma--and a taste--that I quite enjoyed for what was ultimately a sophisticated and time-honored technique delivered in simplistic and humble sandwich form. Schwartz's Deli is a can't-miss in Montreal, especially for a first-timer. Just prepare yourself for what will likely be a long wait and getting to know your neighbors quite well while you eat."

There's no mistake, they do meat so righteously so, I will forever compare any brisket to this standard, I'm indefinitely ruined. I was lucky enough to not have a wait, which probably added to the amazing experience I encountered, but would I wait in line for this? absolutely. There's no point in going into detail about what has been said already by the masses, this place has all the rave it needs and deservingly so. Meaty perfection is just an agonizing wait away, but worth it.

We stood in line and waited for our table. The staff was quick and friendly.Our waiter told us the best sellers and we ordered right away. Nothing fancy just a sandwich. Now me being the cheapo that I am was wondering if a $9 sandwich would be worth it. And it was. I shouldn't have doubted it.It came fast and I devoured it. The meat was tender and juicy, smoked perfectly. It was everything you would want in a sandwich. Simple and to the point. Don't expect anything over the top if you come here. Simple and to the point.

The night before our flight, we went back to Schwartz (takeout side). Totally different experience. The staff wasn't as nice and the sandwich was dry.

We went next door to their ""to go"" side, they also had some bar stools in the back to sit. I shared a sandwich and poutine with my husband. The bread is just a simple slice of bread with a little bit of mustard. The mustard did help cut the Fattiness of the meat. We had some pretty nice cuts, not too much fat but It is very heavy. Flavor was okay, I expected more. I would prefer pastrami over smoked meat. There was just nothing special about It. I was craving poutine, and was also disappointed. Both the gravy and fries were bland. The cheese curds were nice though. Way too overhyped but I understand the novelty of It. I mean It was enough for me to come in and give It a try I guess lol. Overall it's one of those places to try, just so you can say you did. I wouldn't consider It a regular go to though."

For those of us coming from the states, the meat has a slightly different taste from pastrami, but it is quite similar. The sandwich has a good smoky taste but it is on the smaller side. One tip, they have both a sit down restaurant, as well as a take-out section with tables in the back. Because there's often a long line, I'd recommend the take out option as opposed to waiting for a table. This was a great option for me since I visited by myself."

The meat melts in your mouth as you chew it, and the mustard adds a very necessary touch.The place is fairly packed though, and the service isn't that great (which is the case in most very high traffic restaurants of this kind).

Not that clean, which I guess is supposed to preserve character, but the bread with the meat was also just so subpar. Subpar enough that I didn't understand why they wouldn't upgrade a little more. You also are squeezed in to sit with other tables. I just think a little bit of a makeover and attention to detail couldn't hurt the preservation of the history."

We decided to order takeout because the dine in line was way too long. My now-husband dropped me off so I could get in line while he parked the car a little bit away. The menu is very basic and small; there are not many food options here. From my husband's perspective (since I don't eat meat): the sandwich was very tasty and the meat was fresh. However, the rye bread was too small. Overall, this was a smaller sandwich than we expected (even based on having previously seen the pictures on Yelp). The cost is perhaps a little bit high for what it is, but it was a memorable sandwich.There are so many outstanding food choices in Montreal that we probably would not come back here, but we're so glad we went once for the experience."

Definitely got that diner vibe where anyone can take an empty seat and get a chance to mingle with complete strangers - loved it! They also pretty much kick you out when you're done especially when the line ups start going. We didn't get kicked out but the couple beside us were pretty much told they should go, even though they were still drinking their coffee post-meal.We told our server that it was our first time here and wasn't sure what to get exactly and he didn't seem to really care. We ended up getting the smoked brisket, liver steak, coleslaw and fries.Liver steak - just straight up liver with not much else, served medium-rare. No real flavour and was a bit tough. Wasn't a huge fan considering I love anything liver.Slaw and fries were pretty solid and were great sides. Slaw was vinegar-based and perfectly contrasted the fatty smoked brisket we got.There were 3 different choices for the brisket (lean, medium, fatty). We specifically told the guy it was our first time here and when we ordered fatty, we thought that the brisket would have that rim of fat on the edges. But when got it, it was literally fat everywhere. It really would've been nice to have gotten a heads up.

It was quite a scorching hot day in August and I was glad that the line up moved relatively quickly. I was really happy that the air conditioning was so strong inside. I was seated on the counter with a great view of the smoked meat getting cooked.I ordered the regular smoked meat sandwich and it was massive. It had 10-15 thin layers of meat between two pieces of whole grain bread. The meat was so moist and flavourful, you could see the peppercorns but it wasn't spicy at all. I'm glad they gave me a fork because I really did need it to eat all the meat that spilled out. This was so good. My only gripe with the sandwich was the bread - it was just very plain bread that didn't add much to the sandwich. I think it would be great with a more high quality bread instead.I would definitely back next time. It's a great meal and it totally deserves the high rating."

You will literally see the line before you see the storefront. For all the newcomers out there though, don't be intimidated!The line moves very quickly! My pro tip: get in the takeout line. There's a tiny counter at the back of this section of the restaurant where you can take your food. Alternatively, you can take your food down a couple blocks to reach the green where there are benches aplenty at the base of Mont Royal! The smoked meat is the one thing you need to get here at Schwartz's!! Whether in the form of a sandwich or on top of your poutine (Poutine a la Schwartz's), the smoked meat is to die for. It's slow-cooked and falls apart when prodded ever so gently with a fork. The meats aren't necessarily smoky, but they are very well-seasoned. If you haven't yet been, take my word for it. I assure you there exist fewer simple joys in life than a mass of smoked meat sandwiched between two slices of rye bread and slathered with mustard. The Poutine a la Schwartz's was just as satisfying. When topped with hot gravy and fresh cheese curds, this classic side of fries is transformed into a mini meal. What Schwartz's serves is simple, unadulterated comfort food. Do yourself a favor and indulge for your next cheat meal. Your soul will thank you for it!"

I really liked the sauce but I wish there was more. Portion sizes were big, there was a lot of meat stuffed into one sandwich. I wouldn't wait in line for an hour for it though."

I never thought I would be a smoked meat person but that was because I never ate Schwartz's! The meat was tender and flavorful. The mustard completed the sandwich.

If you don't mind cramped seating where you'll be sharing a long table with strangers and a very hectic environment where the servers are running around and the men behind the meat counters are shouting out orders, it could be an enjoyable experience. It's CASH only here though, and there is an ATM machine located in the back but I think they charged a higher ATM fee so I decided to go outdoors where I somehow heard getting cash was easier. AVOID the sketchy outdoor ATM machine covered in graffiti in front of a nearby book(?) store. It looks deceivingly functional since the light is on. You need to go inside the convenience store along the same street and they have an ATM there.Finally after getting the cash, we ordered three regular sandwiches which come on thinly sliced rye bread with some mustard and a decent amount of pastrami. Maybe it's because I haven't had much pastrami in my life but the meat wasn't amazing or memorable. None of us thought it was that great. Just a plain sandwich in my opinion. The tables were kinda dirty and the tap water didn't look so hygienic either."

I got the smoked meat sandwich (there aren't that many options, at least as far as we understood the french menu). We got cole slaw and pickles as sides. The reason I gave four stars is that their sandwiches have nothing on the side, not even a pickle. And the inside is so small, really disproportionate to the line outside!!

But the peppery and hot rendered fat tasted great. Slices were not too thin. Very tender and meaty. Sides are ok at best. Slaw was watery and mushy. But, the meat more than makes up for the weak bread and watery slaw. It's THAT GOOD! For $10 it's a better good deal. Compared to Katz, I'll gladly pay half the price for an excellent smoke meat sandwich for a smaller portion size.Excellent service staff with some delightful convos. FYI cash only."
/user_details?userid=e0AUdCu-jeOkLImiEzlTDg,Jonathan W.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"A bit embarrassing that it took me up till now to finally visit Schwartz's, but better late than never.Aside from the standard fresh light rye bread and regular mustard on top, it all comes down to the meat. I was fortunate enough be be accompanied by a Schwartz's veteran who asked that we get medium fat. Glad we did as the experience was amazing. You risk thinking coming in that the place could be over-hyped by virtue of being an institution, but it really isn't. They apparently made people happy as far back as 90 years ago, and they're still putting smiles on faces and stuffing bellies of today's hipsters, foodies and everyone else in between.The meat is fantastic quality. The medium fat is not fatty per say and you don't risk getting chunks of gristle; it really just adds some taste and juiciness. I was quite pleased by how fresh it was and I also wasn't aware of how peppery it was, which was to my delight. Of course there's copious amounts of meat that you'd never typically want elsewhere normally, but for this quality and experience, it's well worth it. In fact, considering that it's quality beef brisket, you could argue there's some terrific value you get for what must be a half pound of meat.I ordered the made in house pickle and coleslaw. It would've been nice to be able just to be able to order a smaller side of each just to pair with the sandwich as I ended up paying about $6-7 to get a large side of coleslaw and a full-sized pickle - but the price for what you get is fair.The service is quick and functional, but I have to say our guy was super-friendly and not the grumpy type that I was told to expect here at all.I've heard from others and seen other reviews that there are alternatives to Schwartz's to go to so that you can avoid the hype and lines. I'm not so convinced as I really felt I experienced the gold standard in smoked meat sandwiches here. Everyone else should at least visit once before considering as substitution, because I'm not so sure it truly exists."

We decided to just order Togo, which was no lines at all. We ordered 2 smoked meat sandwiches (3/5)- I may not be a big fan of sandwiches but the meat was just ok.

I tried the smoked meat as part of a large plate, which comes with bread. You can choose to add on other things, such as pickles, fries, extra bread. The price is a little expensive, but understandable given that it's such a tourist attraction. To be honest I felt like the meat was super bland. I was expecting something much more flavorful & smokey but it just tasted like soft goops of nothing. I had to slather it in a LOT of mustard and pepper for it to taste like anything. Also, the bread they gave was .....not good. It was somehow dry and crumbly yet tasteless and just overall disappointing. I'd say go just to say you went, but don't expect anything amazing."

The cashier was less interested in cracking jokes and making small talk, just doing her job just trying to get to the end of the line vibe, very blunt and straightforward with everything. Can't blame someone for (ONLY) doing what they're hired to do though.

We knew we each wanted a sandwich but he was also giving us other recommendations that everyone orders. He made it seem like a combo. We each ended up with our sandwich, a cherry cola, a pickle and two poutines to share between four people. Funny thing - neither of us actually like cherry cola or eat pickles but he kept saying it was ""not like what you get anywhere else"" and again, made it seem like a part of the combo so we agreed. I was a little upset because when our bill came, it was $100 for the four of us. A bit pricey in my opinion for food that didn't taste that great. There was nothing special about the poutine and we didn't finish it between the two of us. Can't say anything about the pickles since I don't actually eat pickles.

I don't normally like Pastrami but had to try the classic. It was good! Not too briney (what I don't like anout pastrami) and it was really good with the yellow mustard. A bit fatty but not so much I couldn't work around it. The fries were amazing! The best I have had in Montreal yet! Also I was able to beat the rush (between 12-1p on a Friday) and didn't have to wait.

Without the service, I would give this place 4 stars, and the 4 stars r for the smoked meat, it is indeed juicy and tender, but all those hype on the yelp reviews, I think people really have to understand what out of this world food tastes like cuz this is not. I definitely don't think it's a must try, in fact I totally forgot about how it tastes like 2 minutes after I walked out of there. Why 2 stars, the service is a mess. First of all, the line was super long but we got two very old people in my family, in the beginning I just went to the takeout line to get the sandwiches but then once I got out, the line was extremely short so we decided to eat in, we still lined up for a while in the heat and once we sat down, my mom took the take out we just bought, and I am looking at menu to order something else, but then i overheard one waiter whispering to another waiter ""what the hell are they doing?"" and keeps looking at my mom. My family doesn't speak English well so I feel lucky they didn't hear and couldn't really understand how rude those waiters were, but I could so I went up to explain to him and he did not seem happy. Well, we didn't pay less to get the same smoked meat sandwich so why don't you provide us with some plates, instead you bitch about customers behind their back. This is just insanely unprofessional and I hope Schwartz's can put more attention into screening their employees, good food makes people remember you, but rude service can ruin you too.One more note on the rest of the food items on their wall of menus, no matter what we decided to order, one of the waiters just kept telling us, ""oh, the chicken is super dry, r u sure? oh the turkey would be cold tho, its not good. no, our fries are okay but i wouldn't recommend...well, people come here for smoked meat, what do you expect"", WAIT A MINUTE, if you only have one thing thats good on your menu, THEN YOU PROB SHOULD SHRINK YOUR LONG MENU ON THE WALL SO PEOPLE CAN STOP WASTING TIME DECIDING WHAT TO EAT AND THE LINE CAN MOVE FASTER."

I decided to get a sandwich to go from here one day. If you're going to eat the sandwich/meat on the day of getting it, they recommend to get the smoked meat warm. If you're going to save it for a couple of days, they recommend to get it cold as deli meat. You can also buy their famous mustards, but aside from the measly amount of mustard they put on the sandwich breads, they don't give you any mustard on the side if you're taking your sandwich to go. The meat was okay. I definitely had better smoked meat sandwiches in other places, where the meat would just dissolve in my mouth. This meat was just harder to swallow. It had a lot of fatty layers and biting a piece made it tougher and less delicious. Unlike some of the other reviews, I thought the sandwich portions were okay considering the price, which wasn't bad for a filling sandwich with a good chunk of meat."

After planning the itinerary for a weekend stay in Montreal, this place was mentioned almost everywhere as a place to eat. They have a take-out and a dine-in line but they were both just as equally packed.While we were waiting in line, a old couple in front turned around and sparked a conversation with us. They were super friendly and asked if we've ever been here before & if we're visitors. We had a long talk about what we did during our time in Montreal and they even suggested a couple more things to do. They try to frequent this establishment once a month and had great things to say which made me even more excited to get inside and eat. The line that seemed super long to me was apparently not long at all according to the couple. After about waiting in line for 30-45 minutes, we finally got in and got seated by the front counter. It's a tiny place inside that gave me a old-school diner feel. Some people had to be paired to share a table and be paired up with strangers in order to be seated. I ordered a smoked meat sandwich and it came out extremely quickly, I'm assuming all the meat is cooked and ready to serve and all they have to do is just put it on the bread. The meat was very flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of fat to it. It was also stacked very high that I had to eat some without the bread because it was too much. The meat felt like it was going to melt in my mouth which was absolutely incredible. I was out and about within 20-25 minutes, I didn't want to keep people waiting outside for too long.I would recommend checking this place out if you have time to spare to wait in line if you visit Montreal.."

Fatty meat heaven is all I need to say. Thick, juicy sliced beef brisket piled mile high on rye and covered in mustard. What's not to like?! For me, 5 stars are reserved for an experience that is outstanding overall (eg. combination of service, atmosphere, food) or for a product that is truly outstanding.

Honestly shared with a friend and I regret it lol. The guy who helped us was like ""you'll be back"" and he was damn right. I recommend getting the fattier meat as it just melts in your mouth.

That said, it's a perfectly delicious and unpretentious deli. During our visit around 2pm (the lines didn't seem to be out the door by then), my bf and I shared a large plate of smoked meat (you have option of fatty or lean or combo), which came with about 8-10 slices of bread.

The server came up with his mask down all the way to his cheek. As someone from Toronto, we have strict guidelines as a server. Mandatory masks period. There were droplets coming out of his mouth. He then goes on to take other tables, with his mask removed, touching cutleries, straws, pop and food. It was purely unhygienic during the pandemic. I just didn't feel safe. No matter how much I love deli meat, I will never risk dining in again. As someone form Toronto, we wear our masks even in public spaces."

Smoked meat is a must in Montreal and Schwartz's does a terrific job in fulfilling this experience. I highly recommend just getting take-out rather than dining in. It's way faster and to begin with, there isn't really much room. You can ordered the smoked meats by pound or by sandwich. The sandwich is about $10 while the smoked meat by pound is about ~$20. I recommend just ordering by pound if you're eating with a group. If you're only trying for yourself, grab a sandwich. Sliced smoked meat and brisket are pretty much the same thing. Buy a loaf of bread while you're at it. Slab on some mustard on the bread and assemble your sandwich; it'll be one of your favorite meals in Montreal. You can also get individually wrapped pickles for your sandwich as well :3The smoked meat poutine is also reallllly good! I highly recommend this if you want a little more to your meal. When you order take out, you can actually bring your food to the back to eat. If there isn't room, just walk down St Laurent Boulevard and you'll find seating somewhere. You're also somewhat close to Mt Royal so you can always take it there to eat."

/user_details?userid=9mE7OdvBdTQ8nojYtZxfLg,Paul S.,"Saratoga, CA",5 star rating,"I'm giving this place a five because it is what it is supposed to be. Montreal's legendary smoked meat Mecca. Maybe that is the wrong metaphor since it's run by some Jewish folks, but the idea is right. It's crowded all the time and you have to wait in line outside for the surly wait person to come out and check the line for a party of your size. It looks like they have spent $0 ever for renovation. There is a window in front with a pile of whatever they've recently cooked. Usuallly, a pile of beef briskets, tied in string. Last night it was aPile of smoked chickens very unglamourously dumped. Of course, they don't stay here long, so why make an elegant pile? When you do get inside, you have very few choices to make on the limited menu. It is crowded and noisy and you need to be ready to order as you sit down. This is all, OK! It's part of the Schwartz's shtick. The simple thing to do, then, is immediately order a brisket sandwich and a pickle. I'd also get some fries (frites) which are pretty good. Here is the big hint - get the FATTY brisket in your sandwich. They have three settings: lean (=meat cardboard anywhere including here), medium (what I had mistakenly ordered in the past = just OK), and fatty (= the one that is unmatched and unbeatable). So moist and tender and flavorful. Fatty. Remember that. No beer here. Just water, soft drinks and such. In a way, it's brilliant because with the simple menu and inventory, they can serve you within five minutes even with all he crowd all the time. My chum from work (we are here for a convention) thought it was totally great too."

What the heck, just give me a plate of the smoked meat instead and i'll instantly devour it! For about $10 Canadian cash (which is not too shabby), you get a hot smoked meat sandwich layered with lots of smoked meat and mustard in between. So simple yet so orgasmic. Meat is so tender and juicy and it just melts in your mouth with every bite. I probably ate this whole sammie in less than 5 minutes. I had to slow down so I wouldn't choke on the meat...Other than their popular hot smoked meat sandwiches, you can also buy other meat like turkey, chicken, and salami. They also have sides like pickles and fries. Curious in trying the other stuff but I think I'll stick with their smoke meat ;)Schwartz's has a dine in area with a few tables and seats and also a TO-GO area with a few stools here and there.

/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",4 star rating,"Okay America, meet Montreal-style Smoked Meat. Smoked Meat lovers, it is the ​time to cop a squat and take note because​ I have something from a delicatessen we really don't have at our Jewish and Italian Delis. Enter: ""Smoked Meat"". Do not be like me and wonder ""What kind of Pastrami is this?"" because it is not Pastrami. In many ways, Montreal Smoked Meat is a crossbreed​ of Corned Beef and Pastrami. Much like the two American (or, at least, fostered​ ""American"") styles, Smoked Meat, which is made from Brisket, is first brined before being smoked. One key difference, though, is the flavoring in the seasoning itself. While both Pastrami and Smoked Meat utilize Black Pepper, Coriander, Garlic and Mustard Seed as key seasonings, Smoked Meat uses much less Sugar during the curing process than Pastrami does. But like Pastrami, Smoked Meat is traditionally served in a Sandwich​ on Rye with plenty of Mustard. So it is like... ""Corned Pastrami"" (???). I have a feeling only Mike P. in HB will get all of this.I digress. On to Schwartz's:Much like Katz's to NYC or Langer's in Los Angeles, Schwartz's is a bonafide Montreal institution - nothing less than one of the most celebrated​ delis in the world. It inspired a documentary film and even a live musical (yes, a musical). The Hebrew-style Delicatessen has been open since 1928 and its walls are entirely​ plastered with articles and photos of honorable​ guests ranging from competitors​ like Hank Aaron, actors such as Jerry Lewis and Burt Lancaster, and French Canada's most beloved hometown hero, Celine Dion (now a business partner per my Uber driver and the bartender at NorthStar).And now the Sandwich:You will ​always start with the OG; The Smoked Meat Sandwich​. The fast-talking​ and no-crap-taking waitperson will ask how you want it and what he/she means is ""how much fat content"". This goes low/medium/high and they will suggest medium. They are right. They will also suggest downing the Sandwich with their Black Cherry Cola. They are right again.  The rest is on autopilot and all you need to do is add Mustard. Do this. The result is a luscious​, briny meat with a loveable mouthfeel and a calmed​ Rye Bread experience​ compared to what I told you not to compare it to. The portions, however, roughly​ are. A very, very good Sandwich that is not Pastrami. Or a Rueben. Or #19. In closing, there is no denying Schwartz's history and quality of their Sandwiches but damn it, ​people - it is simply not Pastrami."

There was a line up, expected this due to the hype. There's not much seating and I honestly expected this too after what I observed with Montreal's dining scene. I love the diner feel, the dive feel somehow. Luckily, we got seated within 10minutes of the line up, bypassed some people since there was only 2 of us and we were willing to be seated at the counter.The food: WAS AWESOME. Best smoked meat ever! Bf approved and he's a bit hard to please when it comes to food. Love the fat on the meat. Got a cherry coke for the first time and it was just a perfect combination!The service: Everyone was so friendly! Being seated at the counter, we felt like locals. They were really busy but the guy manning the counter managed to talk to us a bit, smiling. You can tell they're proud of what they have going and happy to serve!"

Definitely recommend at least trying out Schwartz's at least once and you can make your own judgments.Also a small tip, if you don't mind a smaller area to eat on, get a spot on the counter top so you can watch them carving the smoked meat!"

Service was in English and you could be seated with others (our table had 5 young people, too who ate 3 large platters of smoked meat and at least a loaf and half of rye bread)! We split a hot dog, pickle (it's a Jewish deli) and a smoked meat sandwich! Now sandwich bread is smaller then our sandwich bread but the meat is at least 2-3"" tall!

I don't think it's overhyped as in it's not that good, but it is maybe over hyped in that there are other restaurants that will provide similarly delicious smoked meat.

We weren't too hungry and just wanted to try some of the famous smoked meat sandwich so this was a perfect amount of food. The meat was so juicy and flavorful that it melted right in your mouth.

There was a 30 minute wait for their outside seating, which was nothing special. Metal chairs, long plastic table-clothed tables under a makeshift cheap awning. Inside seating was open already, so we went with the latter. Besides, it was rather hot (in the 80s), so no complaining here. The eatery is a small space. There's old dinner bar stool seating and communal tables down the other side. Chatting with the gal beside me, she's from Paris, but's living in Montreal. She expressed how Montreal is a tourist city, yes, but old restaurants like Schwartz is engrained in the fabric of society. Our waiter informed us you can order medium or lean. This refers to the amount of fat you want on the shaved meat. Our waiter recommended medium, so when in Rome, do as the Romans do.It's on the smaller size, circumference-wise. But packed high with the tender as hell beef. The original simply has plain ol yellow mustard, nothing more. The bread is soft and airy, leaves optimal room for the protein!!The best smoked beef sandwich I've ever chomped on! The taste will forever remain ingrained on my tongue."

It's salty, peppery, and just the right amount of fatty (you can always ask for more or less fatty meat). If you want to sit inside, chances are that there is a pretty long line.

/user_details?userid=tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,Smitcha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This is a NO BRAINER. Yeah, the line sucks poutine gravy and it just may be considered a touristy spot. When you're standing in front of the joint, you'll find yourself asking if it's worth the wait. Don't be discouraged though, the line is most likely for the sit down side of Schwartz's. That's how we felt until we found the line to the take out/away which was much shorter and quite fast. The menu is simplified to the max. Three types of sandwiches, poutines, and pickles. All you need is their infamous smoked meat sandwich (first one on the sign, about $10 CAD). The other two sandwiches I can recall is turkey and pastrami. The line probably took us about 10-15 minutes and we got the food the second we placed the order. It's not prepackaged, they just have guys continuously pumping them out. That's why the menu for the take out side of the house is very minimal. We grabbed a few of their #1 smoked meat sandwiches and headed across the street to hang out like hoodlums and enjoy the feast. Trust me, we weren't the only ones doing this. The smoked meat is super tender and not too salty. I wished they had grey poupon available! The sandwich comes with a little mustard but I would suggest adding a little more to spruce up all that meat that is going into your mouth. That's all the sandwich really is; soft white bread, tons of meat, and a dab of mustard. Sounds boring, right? But really it's not. Initially it's like meh but then it leaves you with a lasting impression that comes out of nowhere. We even had this after a full blown meal nearby. I will say, one order for a single person will definitely put you in a coma.If ever in Montreal, don't pass this up especially if you're not a local like myself. It's an one time deal until you come back on another trip. They've been in business since about 1928; it's practically an iconic landmark. The dine in line sucks but just opt for the take out line and eat it elsewhere. You'll be on your way to the next eating adventure in under 30 minutes. Cash only, be ready to sling that CAD$."

Is it touristy? Yes, but there's a good reason for that. Schwartz's has been there for 90 years and they make a damn good smoked meat sandwich. That being said, I wouldn't wait in line all day for it. If you get to Schwartz's close enough to opening, you won't have to wait.

I would honestly give the smoked meat a 5/5 but I had to take a few stars away due to the poor service. Our server was abrupt and unhelpful when we asked for recommendations and spoke condescendingly towards us. At first we thought it wasn't a big deal but then an asian couple came in with their child. The child was basically just moving around in the seat and the server began to scold the family and the child, which kinda forced the mom to leave with the child.

I asked what's the most popular and was advised the 1/2 LB or 1 LB smoked Beef sandwich. I ordered 1/2 LB so I can walk out vs ambulance  assist and added a pickle as well. The sandwich arrived and I could smell the meat, it was wrapped in 3 slices of bread, and a splash of mustard as well.

I had heard good things about this place and how Canada is known for smoked meat. I must say the meat was good but the sandwich left much to be desired. It was on loaf bread with mustard. I understand you go for the meat and a lot of meat was on it (as it should of been for $10) but I think if I did go back I would try there plates of food. I wish the sandwich has more sauce on for me personally because it was a little hard to eat with the bread. The meat was good but don't go too far out of your way for this sandwich. I will say the line was long but very fast they move you through quick. The service was not the greatest but the food was not bad .

Two smoked meat sandwiches, a black cherry soda, and an order of poutine came with a pickle (~30).Had to add more mustard to the sandwich. Wasn't really a fan of the food. The smoked meat just didn't seem worth even the short wait, hype, or even price. Service was friendly and fast. I bet the two guys who sat next to us were pissed we got our food first since we ordered after them. Cash only with the option of ""leaving something extra"" for your server.

This place hasn't been touched since it opened over 80 year ago, making it the oldest in Canada.  They have steaks, turkey and salami, but their smoked meat is the star of the show! Smoked in house, daily, you can order it lean, medium, medium fat or fat on rye bread and mustard. Pickles and coke slaw are served a la Carter and a must order along with their fries. Schwartz's is also credited with creating Montreal steak spice, which you can buy some on your way out. Sometimes there's long lineups, so come off peak times or be prepared to wait. There is a take out shop next door if you don't want to wait. You can also buy a pound or two of their smoked meat to take home with you. Always a good idea. :)"

Tables are communal in a sense that you might share your table with other diners. The host will take your order. They have a variety of different meat cuts: lean, medium and fatty. I would strongly recommend the medium for it has a great balance between tenderness and juiciness. Order it with a Dr. Pepper and a dill pickle and you are set.The sandwich itself is gigantic but my oh my does the meat melt in your mouth; literally! It is so tender that it just disintegrates without any effort whatsoever. The dill pickle gives it a lovely burst of sweet acidic juice that just fills your mouth. Finish it all off with a nice can of Dr. Pepper and you can call it a day.Highly recommend!"

At first I wrote Shwartz's off as a lame tourist trap and wasn't even going to stop in. Let me just say I am so, so glad I stopped in and that this is no tourist trap.

I had a hard time looking for a menu due to the seat I had but to my embarrassment there were two large wall menus I just didn't bother looking up! It does reduce fumbling in the tight space so that is nice. I did notice the staff were friendly and actually having legitimate conversations with customers which definitely gave the nice cosy family vibe.I had meat sandwich with poutine and a tea. He had meat sandwich with a pickle and black cherry soda. I was super jealous because his juicy pickle went perfectly with the sandwich and the soda was so good!!! Luckily he was willing to share :')Washrooms were clean and surprisingly there was one for each gender considering how small the place was I thought that was impressive! One improvement I have is I wish the bread slices for the sandwich were a bit thicker as I feel like the bread was too soggy due to the amount of meat grease and mustard that fills up the bread.I would come back again to order a meat sandwich, pickle, and black cherry soda. Yum!!!"

Across the street was a cut out shipping container turned into seating area. Perfect place to get out of the sun to eat my sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good. Little bit too fatty for my liking. I won't be surprised if I develop a zit or two come tomorrow. Sorry TMI. Overall the meat was good quality and delicious. That bread though was not substantial enough to hold all that meat in.

What used to be a warm Montreal deli has turned into cold one. When I remember going to Schwartz's I remember warm meat, Spicy mustard and fresh bread. Somehow, my expectations were not met. I was served a cold meat sandwich, regular mustard and a complete lack of standards. I'm heartbroken - this business that was at the top of the game about a decade ago and I sense it's is going to fail. Hence the increased prices, lower quality products and overall crappy service. I'm so sorry to say this but I'm sad. Super sad that this institution is going to die. Lower the prices, rely on less tourists, improve the quality of food served - and voila - you've got a viable business model again."

Don't get me wrong: the smoked meat (stateside we'd call it pastrami) is excellent though the choice of whether to serve you lean, fatty or in between seems to be dictated more by what's on the end of the roast than special pieces the carver has put aside. But I wanted some spicy mustard, a slice of cheese for my sandwich and a wider choice of sides and those things were missing. Still felt like I'd taken a few months off my life eating a small sandwich, so I guess I shouldn't complain.Fun fact: on an early evening in February, fully half the diners were Chinese.

Apparently this is THE must stop for smoked meats and classic Jewish fare in the area. We arrived early in the morning and there was the start of a line. If you come before 10am they will not sell you hot meat and that was somewhat of a bummer for hubs as he was really looking forward to a Rueben not just a cold corned beef on not toasted rye. It was huge and priced appropriately for size. He said it was pretty good, not outstanding. I honestly think he was just disappointed that he wasn't able to get what he was really looking for. We also bought one of each of their mustards to bring home to family and house rub. All were absolutely incredible as was the single large kosher dill I couldn't resist. Definitely grab some bottles to go!!! When these are done, I'm calling to figure out how to get more. They're insanely delicious! Best mustard ever! I say give it a go but get there right at 10am to avoid long lines and if you want a hot sandwich.

While tender, there was no real spice or seasoning coming through, and the smoking process interestingly didn't really enhance the flavor of the meat. The rye is good but doesn't really hold up to the meat, with the sandwich falling apart once you get about half-way through. The fries are an afterthought for the kitchen, lukewarm and more limp than crisp - don't bother.What *is* impressive is how quickly they can turn customers here - I was seated at the counter and was in and out in less than 15 minutes, a veritable turnstile. Based on my own experience, my guess is that Schwartz's is resting on its laurels a bit, knowing that the tourists will be coming by given its long history. IMHO, the delis in New York have nothing to worry about."

With that in mind they're done a pretty good job of keeping it real despite the-times-they-are-a-changing...They still smoke their own meat in house (and that's a big deal especially with how much they serve), and after trying many other around the city they are and will continue to be the unique one of the bunch. Their meat and the ambiance can't really be compared - mustard and meat juiced hands down. The staff have an amazing camaraderie that is very hard to come by in today's world of high turn over restaurant staff. Obviously this place has gotten and continues to get a lot of hype. One the owners is just a tad well known around the world, and yes I'm a fan. Go Celine go.Huge shout out to the manager, head slicer and staff for being there day in and day out. Even when they could have an attitude of smoked meat 'kindomship', or old school arrogance, they are respectful and humble.A lean to medium-fat sandwich with a bottle of mustard in one hand, and a Cott black cherry soda in the other - it's a treat and an experience that I still enjoy ...

Time to go to this famous smoke meat place. One of the reasons that I did not go to this restaurant earlier in my life includes different reasons, but mainly the fact that I only tasted mediocre smoke meat sandwiches so far in my life. Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high for Schwartz.I went there on a winter evening with some friends during a weekday. Fortunately, there was only a very small line and we were seated fairly quickly. The decor of the restaurant itself looks very vintage, almost as like they did not change anything since their opening. As for the food itself, the price tags are pretty high considering their portions (around 10$ for a smoke meat sandwich if I am not mistaken). That being said, the sandwich itself was decent, but definitively nothing to hype about. As I am not a big fan of salty meals, this is definitively not in my alley. Unfortunately, Schwartz was not able to convert me into smoke meat"

You can also order additional smoked meat by weight which was what we did, this time opting for a mix of the  fatty and medium. Wow, the fatty smoked was perfection-super juicy and well seasoned. Obviously, we paired it with a pickle and a cherry coke for tradition's sake. Service was amazing!  Efficient, they know what they're doing and our server had a lovely radio voice.

On a recent trip in May I brought some out of towners who wanted to eat here. Let's get things straight. Yes it's a small place and they can boss you around as a patron(like a bistro in Paris). You order lean or medium fat. Lean is dry in my opinion (need the extra mustard to choke it down) and medium is what you want to get if you want flavour. On our visit the service was very cordial polite and one of the guys working says they go through around 2000lbs of brisket a day there. That's a lot of beef. However this is the place to come in MTL and the tourists love it up. In Montreal you can get smoked meat at pretty much any sandwich shop in town. Heck, across the street is the Main, Ruebens on St Catherine or Snowdon Deli, smoke Meat pete's (Ile Perrot) all serve it up quite well. My favourite is in Laval at George's.  Schwartz's did deliver for my out of town guests and I was mildly impressed. I've eaten here probably six times in 10+ years. This visit sure impressed them and that's what counts. My sandwich was decadent and delish as usual. I wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes for a table here but lineups are quite common. On our visit we lucked out big time to get a table very quickly. Great place to bring out of towners but I don't plan to go back unless I have to!"

It is a small place and you will be sharing table with others and sitting shoulder to shoulder. As for the meat, you can order it on a scale of lean to fat. The first plate we ordered is the fat one. It certainly is fatty dan juicy but it might be too fatty for some people. The next plate we ordered is medium fat. It is a bit leaner but is still juicy.

If you want to wait an hour in the cold outside on the streets for a smoke meat sandwich that taste bland and unappealing you can but if you're looking for a better joint for smoke meat sandwiches there are so many better places. Montreal is the Mecca of smoke meat sandwiches! Reuben's on st-catherine's is one of the best places to get smoke meat !! Or if you're in laval : George's is also amazing. Ok back to shwartz's .. it's overrated for many reasons 1st: the service is a mess... they really don't give a shit about customer service. They treat you like garbage. They just want you out the door. There's hardly any seats and your squished to eat your meal with people who look greasy. Your appetite is practically gone when you look at who's eating there. 2) the only reason they are so packed and famous is for the tv shows and the fact that Celine Dion is associated with them.3) the smoke meat is really gross and rubbery! Overall, avoid thinking its good smoke meat.. there's : The main accross the street that offers way better service and way better smoke meat You're welcome :)"

On a brighter note, the restaurant is decent in size and service is quick and efficient, although you do feel slightly rushed. Definitely not a place for long conversations.- It's not cheap, but well worth it.This is a solid smoked meat sandwich. I am not a meat lover, but I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The beef brisket was tender and seasoned just enough to let the meat flavours shine through. Their own blend of steak seasoning was delicious and I enjoyed the extra punch from the mustard. If you don't specify your preference, you will be served a medium cut, which has a decent amount of fat. I didn't try the fatty cut here, but I did have it at Smoke's Meat Pete, and I must say, go for the fatty cut. I was on cloud nine as the  juicy meat just melted in my mouth. Their cole slaw is extremely fresh from the continuous table turns and complements the fatty sandwich well, although it is a tad too tangy. I avoid sugary drinks in my regular diet, but my husband insisted on getting the cherry coke as it goes well with the smoked meats. I can't say I loved the combination, but I may have been biased seeing that there was over 40 grams of sugar in that one can.Overall, this may be the best smoked meat sandwich I have had, although I do find it a tad pricey for what you get. This was our second meal, so we ordered one sandwich to share, a side of cole slaw, a huge pickle with a cherry soda. It came to about $24 with tax and tip."

As a NY native, Katz's is considered the holy grail, but after having Schwartz's, I can say I've had one of the best. I was warned Schwartz's is a tourist trap, and for good reason. The meat is flippin amazing! Definitely lives up to the hype. The lines can get long. I was lucky enough to notice the smaller, take out version of their establishment next door did not have a line. Went right in and got my sandwich without a wait. Within 30 minutes, the line for that place was tremendous as well. The meat literally melts in your mouth. You barely have to chew. I like mine on the fattier side and asked for the fatty cuts, but their meat is so tender I don't think it needed the extra fat. The rye bread is kind of an afterthought that holds all the meaty heaven in place. Mustard is much needed to cut through the richness. They're pretty generous with their portions. I'd totally wait in line for another one of these babies."

And sure it's touristy and there is a line all the time... But it's an institution that has been around a long time and will hopefully be for a many years more.The food is good, and the prices are reasonable. When it comes to the smoked meat sandwich you have a choice between lean or regular with more fat. If you want it to be moister don't go with the lean but either I'm sure tastes great. When I was there we got a fries to share, and also a pickle to share which I think was a good call. The pickles are big and the fries are enough for two people to share. The other big thing there is to get a cherry soda. So do yourself a favour and get a smoked meat sandwich, some fries and ketchup, some pickle and a cherry soda and you'll be good to go"

I came here twice in my short trip because it is just THAT good. My personal suggestion is to get it medium fat with a side of pickles. The pickles compliment the fat perfectly! I waited about 30-45 minutes when I came for dinner but had no wait at all when I came for lunch, so I would highly suggest coming at odd hours. But regardless the wait was well worth it!

This place is little more than a hole in the wall that has been doing ONE THING to PERFECTION since Rueben Scwarts first open its doors waaaaay back on December 31st, 1927. The Romania smoking techniques have been passed down and unchanged since. This place is small, tight and no frills. The flatware, cups, plates and placemats are all basic but that's not why people wait in line through rain, snow, Sharknado's what the fuck ever. The food is good, decadent and filling. If your on a diet, dont even bother coming here. I has the number 4 with fries. A Reuben on rye with a side of fries. It was magical."
/user_details?userid=uKqkquINCbM-j2ZgvAfYsA,Stanley C.,"Newark, DE",3 star rating,Hmmm. I might need to give this place another try. The sandwich that was given to me was not even warm. I think this definitely changed the texture and quality of the smoked meat that I ate. It was dry and not that flavorful. The amount of meat was adequate for the price and I would've loved to eat more if I had more stomach space!This is a small shop and I was confused of how to order. Just wait for them to let you know you can sit down and they have waiters around that will take your order. They serve it pretty quickly afterwards because the smoked meat is already done. They just toast some bread and slather some mustard on it then bring it to you.I enjoyed the Cole slaw. It was perfectly seasoned and complemented well with the smoked meat.

So what choice did I have? The guy asked if I want the same (as the couple) and I went ""Yeah.""Turns out it's Smoked Meat sandwich, dill pickle, french fries, and cherry coke. A lot of food!The sandwich is just... perfect. So simple but ... so good! When it started being a bit dry their fries and pickle helped. Fries... were the kind of magic fries that are amazing even if soggy... I gather prob due to extra amount of grease? I did not want to know but I ate every last scrap because that fry was EXZCELLENT~ Pickle was good but at $2 CAD... Well. Cherry coke is a MUST with this meal. One downside was that I found out later that this is all cash and I obviously hadn't even calculated the total upon ordering! I was $5 short in CAD, but cashier allowed me to pay the rest in USD, which they penalize you a bit against the CAD. Overall, I spent $20 CAD - so while a bit expensive, it was a lot of satisfying greasy bites. This one is an easy 5-star."

According to the locals, you're supposed to get the Medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, and the sides of dill pickle, hot peppers and black cherry cola on the side.Even though I don't have much experience with smoked meat, I have to say I had a very good experience there. The sandwich was on point with the medium fattiness. The hot pepper and dill pickle really compliments the smoked meat well, and the cherry coke just washes everything down perfectly. This is the must get combo if you come here.Also, I heard that this place hasn't changed much since the 1940's. So if you want to experience some traditional Canadian eats, check this place out."

It's a simple deli that's been around for ages and still only makes the classics. They also sell a variety of seasonings so you can make their classics too. Also important to note, it's a Jewish deli but not a kosher deli. There are two sides - sit down and takeaway. If you're in a rush or it's a nice day, definitely jump on the takeaway line and grab the smoked meat (brisket) sandwich to go. It's a few blocks from Mont Royal Park so you can bring your food there, or find a seat at ledges across the street. I haven't dined in the real restaurant since I have a strong aversion to waiting on lines, but it's the same classics so I'd recommend the take away. The sandwich is simple with just the warm smoked brisket, spiced to perfect, and a touch of mustard. I'm not a huge mustard fan and thought the touch of it was perfect. Enjoy!!"

According to google and yelp, this was the best place to devour Montreal Smoked Meat. Indeed, this was absolutely true. Their smoked meat was heavenly. We arrived a little after 10am on Thanksgiving day. Walked in and was seated immediately by a man behind the counter. After we sat down, the only waiter in the entire restaurant came by and wanted to take our orders. I asked if I could get a menu because I'm not aware or sure of how to order and exactly what to order. The man rudely said and I quote ""there is no menu, we only have smoked meat and we're very well known for that"" and he proceeds to point to their wall covered in newspaper clippings of their restaurant. We were already turned off by the rude comment. But we insisted on having smoked meat for brunch. We settled for two Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. These sandwiches were gigantic and beautiful. They are what heaven is made of, i'm sure of it. Fresh bread spread with mustard and filled with so much Montreal Smoked Meat that you totally forget about the bad service. Each bite reminded me that I was closer and closer to finishing my sandwich and that i should probably pace myself. But it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. Before you knew it, i gobbled up my sandwich in about 10 minutes. Would I be back at Schwartz's? Probably not. I'm sure there are other places that have Smoked Meat at par. To me, customer service is very vital. I'm all about the food, but good customer service goes a long way."

There's mostly one thing you want to order, a smoked meat sandwich, if you're in a big group of people, you can order it so that they can give you a few slices of bread and give you your smoked meat on the side, and then you can make your own sandwich. So about the sandwiches, like I said before, it's not the best. It's actually kinda salty in my opinion, but then again, maybe that's how it's supposed to be!?!? I feel like it would be so much better with melted cheese in there!!! It would definitely help with the saltiness of the meat. One sandwich is good enough for me. There are other stuff that you can order, but everyone goes there for the smoked meat. I would recommend going here if you wanna try the ""famous smoked meat"" but it's mostly all hype to me. But anyways, the reason I'm giving such a high review even for a so-so experience is because our server Eddie was awesome! He was knowledgeable, friendly, and funny! He knew we were from the States so he told us stuff about the restaurant and engaged in some cool conversations with me. Tips:The smoked meat will come as trim, medium fat, or fatty!

We ordered the traditional smoke meat sandwich with a side of coleslaw, pickles, fries. As I was waiting for my food, I watched people line up to pay at the cash- the cashier demanded tip from each client if they hadn't tipped already. Although, there is a provincial law in place for a minimum 15% service gratuities -she was rude and it frankly just doesn't make ""Schwartz"" appear friendly. Regardless to say our server was friendly and we received our food quickly. The smoked brisket was so juicy and tender and the rye bread was perfectly steamed that it remained soft for the rest of my meal. I couldn't finish my meal.

It's really not as big as it looks in the photos! We waited in line for only a few minutes before being offered seats at the counter. The whole time I'm sitting there wondering what animal smoked meat comes from, but not wanting to ask. It's not any of the reviews on Yelp that I could find, and I've never seen it in Portland. I was way too afraid to ask, and it took a fair amount of Googling to find out that it's corn beef that's been slowly smoked and heavily seasoned with a variety of seasonings. It's delicious is what it is. Great service. The guy who helped us was hilarious. At the end of the meal he asked us if we were ready for dessert. 'What do you have?' 'More meat!' We may not have been ready then, but we sure are now!"

It was tasty smoked meat and bread on the menu with some fries and side options but they focus on that brisket.

The poutine we ordered was surprisingly good though! Not too salty and very crispy fries not quite drowning in gravy, it was my favourite thing here...not to say don't come but I'd prefer waiting for something better.

I actually saw this place on Trip Advisory, with well over 1k of positive reviews. There's usually a line-up so I went first thing in the morning. They start service at 10:30am and even then, the tourist (like me) were already starting to pack in.I came back the next couple of days but was discouraged by the long line outside. What I found out though is the line is for the sit-in. They have a store beside them that does take-outs only and there is no line-up. Well, depending on the time you go, I guess, but it's not comparable to the dine in. When you order, you can ask for fatty, medium or lean meat. I got the medium fatty because to me, the fat makes it tastier. When I got the smoked sandwich, I thought it looked too small, but it was a satisfying amount. Also, I overheard the waiter that if you're buying a platter of meat, they charge extra dollar per person. That, or you all order your own stuff. I can understand why. They're a pretty small restaurant and they get a lot of people waiting to sit in. They also accept US dollars, and they have a sign of their conversion rate, so that's cool too. I'm not big on deli, but I've had my share and I say that hands down, this is the best I've ever had."

A little tip...the line is always obscene, so if you do take out the line is much shorter. Look for the take out door, it's oftentimes covered by the massive line of people queuing up to eat there. If it's your first time in Montreal it is worth a try and Good luck with the line!"

It is quite squishy inside but we sat at the counter and ordered 2 Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches which they gave us immediately. We were in and out within 10 minutes -- granted we were so hungry when we sat down so the sandwiches were basically engulfed within minutes. I have to agree that the sandwiches are good BUT there are definitely other places in Montreal that serve better smoked meat sandwiches. Others may disagree with me but I definitely would not return to Schwartz unless someone else wanted to try it. It's worth the try but if you've visited Montreal multiple times, there are other options out there to avoid the line and price. Each sandwich was around $10 and with two cans of pop our total for 2 people was $30 -- making this the most expensive meal we had in Montreal for the least amount of food. Overall, I would say it worth the try because it is quite good but it's not a must-go-to place for me."

Line on a weekend was quite long, but wait time was no more than 30 mins (apparently much shorter if you go for take out).The restaurant is small and old-fashioned from top to bottom. The menu is also very simple. Amongst three friends we ordered the smoked meat sandwich, small meat platter (meat with bread on the side), and a grilled liver steak.The smoked meat (pastrami) was good: a nice balanced cut of fatty and lean meat that is warm, juicy, and flavorful. However, having tried various pastrami places in NYC, I have to say that the meat at Katz's is still a notch better. The rye bread here though is very good, and I was able to make many small sandwiches rather than having a big sandwich.The liver steak is quite unique and great if you like liver, but that is a big if (also comes with a small frank on the side). My friend thoroughly enjoyed it though. Also on the house was coleslaw and pickles: I didn't try either, but friends said that they were both good.Bottom line: Might be the best smoked meat around town, but definitely not the best I've ever had. Prices are on the higher end of things, but still worth trying out."

I arrived there in the late afternoon and was a bit hesitant to visit from the looks of the line of about 15-20 people standing outside. Someone had just left a parking space right in front (metered parking in the area) and I pulled in. I got on the line and waited for a few minutes. Someone came out and went down the line asking how many people were in each ""party"". I naively answered ""1"" (my fiance and son were waiting in the car) , not knowing that the line was for Dine-In only. The take out door was right next door with no line. I walked in and ordered a smoked meat sandwich, which by default comes on Rye sliced bread and mustard. The staff was friendly and efficient, but you can easily tell that they were busy and had an assembly line mentality...very efficient. Know what you want before getting up there. (I'm a New Yorker and had no problem with that because that's kinda how we are) The sandwich was about $10. I was in and out in about 5 minutes. I took it back to the car and took and big bite. I was surprised at how flavorful it was. The meat itself was juicy and well seasoned. It was also not as greasy as I expected. Being from NYC, the closest comparison I have with this is the Pastrami from Katz's Deli. Katz's sandwich is great and all, but I've always found it to be very greasy for my taste. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal. I would add this to the ""must"" while visiting list. Next time, depending on the line, I would love to experience dining in."

I have to say, the smoke meat is pretty good if you know how to order.  Most people usually order medium fat. But the best smoke meat is the fatty ones. My boyfriend and I usually order a large plate of montreal smoke meat alone and share it. There's a plate sharing fee of $1.75, I believe. This included a side of bread. This is nicely paired with cherry coke. But sometimes we get cream soda. We've also gotten a Montreal chicken. The chicken was ok but I don't feel like it's worth it because it's more expensive than the smoked meat. I like the smoke meat better We've also tried the pickle. The pickle is a little too salty for our liking.  Fries here are also okay but the Montreal smoke meat is the main show. Overall, I would recommend to at least try this place.

Then when its your turn they tell you in a condescending way with an attitude ( the old guy in the cashier) to pay on the prep section.

We shared the smoked meat sandy, fries, and a cherry cola. There was outdoor seating tent set up but if you walked in you couldn't sit outside because that was waiter service. We didn't mind sitting in the back of the place next too the window. The smoked meat was really tender yet with thick cuts but didn't have much flavor and the fries were not crispy. Boo Boo would give this place a 3 but 4 stars is fair. I'm no pastrami expert but the sandwich tasted good to me.I did like the cherry cola a lot. It's different and has a weird after taste which reminded of all the crap I ate growing up in the states. I couldn't find the soda in supermarkets like the IGA in downtown. Credit card accepted."

/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"Schwartz's was high on our list of places to visit when in Montreal. My husband loves smoked meats, and we'd heard comparisons to Katz's in New York, so we were eager to try their sandwiches.Plus, we hadn't eaten anything more than a tiny poutine sample and some nibbles on a beer tour prior, so we were starving.Everybody said to be prepared for a wait. As a tourist attraction, it gets busy. It was almost 6:30 pm on a Friday night when we approached the restaurant, and though there was a line out front, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected.They do a good job of managing the people outside and clearing tables inside. We thought we were going to have a wait of upwards of 20 minutes ahead of us, but the guy working the line got us inside and at a table for 4 (with another couple) within five minutes.It is crowded inside. The deli counter runs along the right side of the restaurant, taking up most of the space inside. Tables are crammed along the left side, with a very narrow aisle for servers and customers to walk down. The register is located at the front of the store (inconvenient if you're in the first table with your back to the register, like me), and the restrooms are squished in towards the back.Menus are either above the counter or on a placemat on your table. The harried wait staff will come by to take your order, though, which is nice because fighting the crowd to get to the counter would have been a nightmare.Our waitress suggested the smoked meat sandwich (""of course""), which we each ordered. To that, we added an order of the hand-cut fries and the pickles. While we waited, I tried to make small talk with the couple across from us. We were forced to sit together, and we were both trying Schwartz's for the first time. I was trying to be nice. I asked, ""So, where are you two from?"" and got, ""Ontario"" out of them before they shut me down. That didn't make for an awkward meal at ALL.The food came out quickly, which I absolutely appreciated (because I was starving, not because the other couple was making things strange.) The pickle(s) that we had ordered turned out to be one regular-sized dill pickle, whole. The fries were a bit cold and didn't look like a whole lot.As for the sandwich...my husband liked it a lot more than I did. The meat was good, and the bread was soft and moist, but it didn't wow me the way Katz's sandwiches did. It was good to try, and I'm glad we went, but after we left, we both agreed that there was no need to try to go back. It's too frenzied inside, and it's kind of pricey for what you get. You know - at Katz's you pay through the nose, but you're given a sandwich the size of your face. Here, it's kind of expensive for a regular-sized sandwich. Maybe that's just the American in me expecting everything to be ""super-sized"", though."

Only slight downside is lack of space kind of crowded and prices are a little high. And often there's a lineup so you got to be patient but I guess that proves that if the people are willing to wait in line you must have a very good smoked meat.
/user_details?userid=A08xF_ykmsWQV0ypYA8wkA,Jing X.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"I'll save you some waiting time by starting my review with a helpful note: you can skip the long line!  The line outside of Schwart's is for the small dine-in section of the main deli.  The building on the left has the same awning and is the take-out deli. The line inside is short and moves VERY rapidly as most people are purchasing packaged meat or smoked meat (aka pastrami) sandwiches to go.  A few people (like us) will notice that there are a few stools in the back of this deli against some counters for eating.  Short line and a place to sit?  Plus a restroom to wash hands afterwards?  Win-win!My friend and I originally waited in the main line on a Sunday afternoon along with other tourists and then realized there was another door.  We went in, bought our smoked meat sandwiches ($9.60), cherry soda ($2.35), and poutine with smoked meats ($9.45), and sat in the back to enjoy Montreal's top pastrami sandwich.  In less than 10 minutes.The sandwich looked pretty small when wrapped but once revealed, we were shocked at the amount of meat they stuffed between two small slices of bread.  (We should have just gotten 1 to share instead of 2.)  They also managed to squeeze in some yellow mustard.  Two people can definitely share one sandwich.  The poutine was rich and heavy, as expected.  It was so much food that we brought the poutine back to reheat for breakfast the next morning.Unfortunately, the sandwich was more on the dry and salty side.  They got the smoky taste down but it's not as good as the pastrami in Katz's Deli back home (NYC).  I loved the cork board in the back and all the love notes that people write on their paper napkins.  They're pretty fun to read as they are written in various languages, including pictures and stick figures."

WARNING, they don't take credit card here in purpose. When you walk in they do say, ""we do accept USD"". Okay, but once you go up to pay, you find out it's an even USD$ TO CAN$ PLUS 10% exchange (as of June 2018). I've traveled all over the world, and this is a first for me. That's basically close to a 40% exchange fee. WTH?! I hate any place that won't take credit card because the CC companies charges the merchant 1.5%, but then turn around and want to charge 40% on their paying customers? That's just horribly wrong. I told them that and the guy was clearly offended.  His response was ""well, they do it downtown too"", and ""in the USA they don't take Canadian dollars"", and ""we are not a bank"" (yeah, more like loan sharks!) Bottom line is if they don't want to take CC, then they should offer something on planet Earth, not 40%!"

The sandwich itself had like a 3:1 meat to bread ratio, making it a good value but hard to eat and hold, since the bread is thin, commercial bread slices. The sandwich is automatically made ""medium fat"" if you don't specify otherwise and has mustard on it. Not sure exactly what it is, but it's kinda like corned beef but on the dry side.

I really wanted to like this place but it just fell short. Overall, the sandwich was just okay. Luckily I did not wait long to get seated, however, if the line were any longer I'd say it wouldn't be worth it. The flavor of the smoked meat was very tasty, it's less peppery than the American pastrami and more mild, which I liked. My one complaint about the meat is that it was sliced too thick which made it tougher to eat (I prefer thin sliced). The bread was pretty standard and a little too soft because it fell apart easily as I bit into the sandwich. I also highly recommend that you order the dill pickle or coleslaw (which is vinegar based) to accompany your sandwich to cut through the fattiness of the meat.The highlight of our meal was the fast, efficient, and friendly service. Make sure you bring plenty of Canadian currency because this place is CASH ONLY. They will let you use American currency but you will be charged extra.

Also, the place had the audacity to charge $2.50 for pickles and other extra toppings. What a rip-off!

If you're visiting, you can go next door and buy yourself some of their meat to take home."

I would've asked for more fat. I found mine a tad too lean and dry. And I think I may have missed out by not ordering the black cherry soda. Maybe next time...

The waiters were super friendly and seated us surprisingly quickly in such a crowded restaurant. Didn't need a word of French in here to communicate :D. The guests next to us were locals and were super friendly and had recommended a few things. The place is definitely very lively and more for the young, starving student crowd as opposed to a family oriented restaurant. And the FOOD. SOOOO GOOD. Got the obvious choice of smoked meat sandwich. The meat was sooo tender and just melted in your mouth. The little bit of fat actually gave a great texture to the meat. There are reviews saying Schwartz has become a 'tourist trap', but I certainly beg to differ. Definitely recommended if you're ever in beautiful Montreal!"

Everg single time we come to Montreal we have to come here no matter rain or shine. There was a line up because we had the bright idea to go during lunch and of course it had to be raining while we were waiting....originally they told us it was going to be a 1 hour wait but the rain kept pouring so I KNEW that groups in front of us would eventually give up so all we had to do was wait it out....and JUST LIKE WAITING for a big fish automatically 3 groups left and we were right in front.We finally get into the diner and ordered poutines, smoke meat sandwiches, and cherry cola. It was the first time I had the Smoked meat Fresh on a plate as opposed to my usual in a car while driving from a takeout container.  Both versions are good but the fresh sit down version was sooo delicious!!!The service here is phenomenal and the staff are all really friendly and efficient! It took awhile for us to get our sandwiches due to a small mix up but our server did not hesitate and immediately apologized and gave us 3 free poutines to make up for it without us even asking and then the sandwiches came right away!  NOW THATS SERVICE with a Smile!I will definitelys be coming back here on my next Montreal visit!"

Actually, I'm not a huge red meat fan at all. My first time at Schwartz was a little weird, the meat to bread ratio is like 5:1 but the second time around, i was craving for it. There's a mild buttery-oiliness to it, but smothered between the mustard and bread, it is DELICIOUS. I'm salivating just talking about it.

Ended up ordering another sandwich for my friend and a plate of just brisket for myself (I like to pretend I'm eating low carb when things like that happen).

Smoked Meat Poutine - a friend got this variation and it's good too.  Lots of carbs, good cheese curds, delicious smoked meats, gravy.  I had a bite and you can't go wrong with poutine.  It's calories in an aluminum pan.  Overall, I'm glad to have stopped by Schwartz's.  It's a quick and simple visit and it's no wonder the lines are so long.  I really liked the smoked meats and the mustard but bet their sandwiches used to be bigger than they are now.  Schwartz's accepts credit cards."

So made it a mission to visit Schwartz! Let me start off by saying that we unluckily arrived on a rainy gloomy day while there was a road closure on the main street due to a street festival. We were not familiar with the area and parking was impossible to find.. After several rounds around the neighbourhood.. We ended up parking at the Pharmaprix beside and grabbed a quick bite. The smoked meat was delicious and the staff were very friendly.. It is a seat yourself environment where you will more than likely find yourself sharing a table with a stranger.

Let just say all the love was put into the smoked meat and no love was put in there.Final verdict: Would bring my dad to try it one day because he loves a good chunk of meat.

The flavor is very sweet, sort of in the same family as grape juice, and pairs well with the smoked meat.While Schwartz's is definitely worth a visit for the charm factor, I would not say they make the best meat sandwich I've ever had. The bread was too soft in the center and the crust was too chewy. I could also have used more flavor - maybe marinate the meat with more salt or pepper, or add some onions.

Unbeknownst to us, you can actually select how fatty you would like your meat to be (I recommend medium). The lean meat is nicely smoked, while the fatty meat add a great texture. Despite being a simple sandwich, you will leave stuffed with the amount of meat they stuff in there. I was not the biggest fan of the coleslaw however; I would have preferred a mayonnaise based dressing rather than a vinegar base as it was a tad bit too sour. I would suggest a pickle instead."

/user_details?userid=9eehtcnYhZAHug1uMI6iRQ,Kojo A.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"Since we were in Montreal, we were essentially required to indulge in smoke meat sandwiches. As far as tradition goes, smoke meat + Montreal = Schwartz's. The restaurant has been open since 1928, and the history shows when you're finally able to get a seat inside. The long, thin interior coupled with the restaurant's popularity makes for a very busy establishment. No matter how you slice it, you're going to have to get friendly with those around you.The sandwiches are basic, and exactly what's you'd expect. You'll get an unreasonable amount of smoked brisket, between thin rye bread slices, with a spread of regular yellow mustard. The folks at Schwatz's obviously know not to mess with what's not broken, and serve you up a simple sandwich that people have lined up for for years. All that being said, history alone does not make a knock-your-socks-off sandwich. If we're being honest, these sandwiches are pretty dry. I definitely suggest giving yourself a squeeze of yellow mustard for dipping, and having a glass of water at the ready.If you're looking to experience some culinary history, and a satisfying sandwich, try this place out."

I was already full from dinner but I was so tempted to eat again just to try the delicious looking smoked beef.  Sadly, didn't want to eat 2 dinners and I've been regretting it ever since.  EIGHT YEARS of regret!So immediately after landing at the airport, i hightailed it to Schwartz's and it was actually better than I expected! We got there around 9pm on a Saturday and there was a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. The line actually moved fairly quickly and we were seated at the bar after about 15 minutes. The waiter was very friendly and insisted that we get a sandwich, fries, pickle and a drink. That sounded just about perfect, but just as he put in my order for a medium sandwich, corrected him and told him that I wanted a FATTY sandwich. The FATTY was actually perfectly marbled and and was absolutely delicious. The sandwich was very simply made - about 3.5 inches of thinly sliced smoked beef, with a little bit of mustard, between 2 slices of rye bread. The fries were OK, and the pickle was OK. I wanted some veggies so I also asked for a side of slaw which was tangy and sweet. The sandwich was amazing and I'm glad that I finally got to have one after waiting 8'years for it."

Number 4 on their board of items to order. That's the thing you get here (and of course, get some poutine) and that's the thing people will ask you if you got here. It's incredibly, wildly popular here. Which doesn't coordinate well with the teeny interior. There is precious little seating, so unless you luck out on a rainy day and arrive with no waiting for a single seat at the bar (but a nearly full house otherwise) at 11:25am, you're going to wait. By the time I left at noon, there was a monstrous line out the door and down the sidewalk. If you've made it past those two paragraphs up there, I should also indicate that there's a massive menu here and I feel kind of bad giving you the same tourist info that is undoubtedly on many websites and traveler books. Yes, this is what you get. But it seems like if I were to come back and really dive into the menu, I could find some things that are real treasures. The fellas next to me came in and ordered something entirely different; one was a local and the other visiting, trusting his judgment. Indeed, the menu is actually pretty large.I delighted in that sandwich, was totally happy to have also ordered poutine, and it was a totally wonderful and pleasant meal. The bread, the mustard, the pastrami; it's hearty stuff and stacked high. Currently it's around $10 for the sandwich, and I was out of there for less than $20 with the poutine. Be aware that it's cash only. There's an ATM a few doors down, and they were super patient as I asked directions. The whole staff, in fact, was patient with my questions. Incredibly kind and tolerant. I'm sure I asked the same questions that they're asked a hundred times daily, but they were nice in answering, prompt in service, and got me in and out quick--but not too quickly.You have to get the smoked meat sandwich.

It's a real hole in the way type joint, but they get you to food fast which makes sense because the place is so small, but they take so long in getting your payment with doesn't make sense cause the place is so small. We got the poutine and the smoked meat sandwich. The poutine was just ok. It was drowning in gravy and the gravy was a little too salty for my taste. The smoked meat sandwich was everything i wanted. Not too salty, super tender and melts in your mouth. The portion size was just right, with 3 pieces of bread cause 2 isn't enough. I was definitely satisfied."

Luckily there was no line when we went, but I heard there's usually a huge line. To start off, Schwartz is quite small and has that old diner feel to it. Even though it's small, their sandwiches are definitely not small! My friends and I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich, poutine, and the black cherry drink. The poutine was alright, just tasted like normal poutine, but the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich was absolutely amazing! There was so much meat stacked in the sandwich and mustard on the bread complimented the meat nicely.Also, beside Schwartz, they had a ""take out"" Schwartz store that let you buy the meat to make your own sandwiches at home! My friends and I bought some of the packed meat to take home. The coolest part of this was that there was a tac board filled with napkins pinned on it with people writing comments about where they're from and what they thought of Schwartz!   If you're ever in Montreal, definitely stop by here, even if there's a line! It's definitely worth experiencing it! This was definitely the best part of the trip!"

You get the option of lean, medium and fatty for your meat as well! We chose the fatty option, which you can fully indulge in without feeling sick - the meat is incredibly tender and the fat contrasts with the bread for a great texture.Definitely worth a visit if you're in Montreal."

I did what people in front of me did and ordered the $2.50 pickle -- you can skip that.  You're welcome. Also ordered a pepperoni stick and hot cherry peppers.   They were OK.   Not bad,  not great; they were, like the pickle,  exactly what they purported to be.  Didn't get the fries (because you know,  carbs and such), but they were fresh cut and looked awesome.I highly recommend this place if you like meat!"

Surprise - credit cards are not accepted. American debit cards arent accepted either. You can pay american cash they just do a 20% exchange  rate. The check already had 2 unfamiliar lines that were added to the bill. One was 10% and another one is something else. We assumed its tax and tip.  The cashier  tells us the total of $26 American. We give her $30 American  and she gives ..... 25 Canadian cents back.

/user_details?userid=65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I was lucky enough to get a great parking spot right in front of Schwartz's on St Laurent.  I had to remind myself how Montreal parking works... it's been a while since I've driven in the city.  You have to know your parking spot assigned number so you can enter it into the parking machine on the street.  You don't need to put the ticket on your dash, you just need to make sure you're entering the right spot assigned number in to the machine.I didn't see any lines so this was good... it was about 4:45pm.  Walking into the place it was still packed.  There was a single stool at the bar so I ended up taking that spot which worked out since I was by myself.The choice was simple... smoked meat sandwich!!!  If I didn't get the fries I probably could have eaten 2 sandwiches.  I did get the fries which are basically fries but they are good.  The black cherry Cott soda was a good compliment.  I'm trying to drink less pop these days but really it was a must to complete the trinity.  This sandwich is spot on and this is one of the reasons why Montreal will always have one up on TO when it comes to food... IMO this one food item is one of the cornerstones of Montreal's food extravaganza.  If it's not their version of bagels, or pizza or steamies it's their smoked meat and this place serves the best I've had.  I went to Katz in NYC but didn't get end up eating there.  We walked in and walked out pretty fast.  Why?  It felt like I was lining up for get on a Disney ride before the reservation system.  Thanks but no thanks... it was a long walk that day in the summer in lower Manhattan and although I can't compare what Schwartz's has compared to Katz's I probably won't ever have to.  Schwartz's was no nonsense, quick, no line up and I didn't have to feel like I needed a wristband to get into a club that had bottle service.Schwartz's again = the best I've had in my life for Montreal smoke meat.  Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave in NYC so far is the best corned beef and pastrami I've had.  Schwartz's prices also are not outrageous either.  Considering they serve a lot of sandwiches both eat in and take out their consistency of their quality has really no choice but to be what they are in order to garner the attention they deserve.  I will have to now make this restaurant a must go place every time I go to Montreal now... I think I may go there again on the way out of town too!"

We stopped in during a weekday lunch and while busy, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat immediately at the bar.  Friendly service and he helped guide us in our selection. As she wasn't too hungry (and I was famished), we went with the platter complete with some slices of rye bread.  It was definitely large enough for the two of us and the server was happy to provide a few more slices of bread to round out the meal.  I'm glad I went but also would look forward to trying other places in Montreal just to see how it competes.  Until then, Katz's still holds the crown....."

There's a reason this place is so well-known and beloved (apparently there's even a musical named after it - who knew!). First, if you're driving. We found free parking on a small residential street behind the restaurant. But note that you can only park there during certain times, so read the signs! (i.e. parking between 11AM to 3:00 PM, etc).Second, the visit. We came around 11:00 AM on a Friday, and there was no lineup! The place was certainly very busy but we were seated right away. We weren't too hungry and ordered just one smoked meat sandwich, fries, and 2 black cherry sodas, per many recommendations below. In short - amazing. I'm not normally a fan of deli meat but it was cooked to perfection. Soft, smoky, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with a great kick of spicy mustard. The black cherry soda was the cherry on top! There's no question that I'll be back here when I'm visiting Montreal again.This place might look like a total dive (think 80's diner), but it's clean, service is friendly and efficient, and the food makes for a simple yet unforgettable meal. For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $23.00."

No suprises - it was the real deal.Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Schwartz's is the definition of no frills, but the friendly staff are accommodating even if the place is packed with a line out the door (which is likely). I grabbed a seat at the bar, asked for the goods, and had a steaming hot sandwich in front of me in no time. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?If they wanted, Schwartz's could easily charge a ridiculous premium for their sandwiches - but they don't, and my standard sammie came in at $8.70. Have a look:yelp.com/user_local_phot…That's fair. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Make no mistake, this was absolutely marvelous. Sure, the bread and mustard are standard white and yellow, but the meat is absolutely heavenly. Slow smoked so that it's tender, but the consistency is maintained to where it doesn't fall apart and the flavor mixes a nice lean cut with just the right band of fat and seasoning. Brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?It's damn close, but as hard as it might be to believe, on one occasion I had a smoked meat sandwich that was better than this on account of the slightly better bread and equal meat:yelp.com/biz_photos/mile…So, that exists, which makes it such that I can't quite go with the full five stars here. Make no mistake, you should absolutely come to Schwartz's as it's the best in the city by a mile, but it didn't quite secure the crown. No Star Granted."

The bread was incredible, but my favourite side was either the coleslaw or the sour pickle. I honestly couldn't choose. The coleslaw was like a step up of KFC, with a vinagery-sweet taste.

The place is cramped and there were many people dining in; however, I had an issue with the strong urine odor in the dining area, so that can definitely lead to appetite loss.  Cash only, and you pay up at the front.  Just note that if you plan on getting there early, smoked meat does not get served until after 10:30 AM.+Smoked Meat sandwich = underwhelming+strong urine odor in the restaurant (!!!)+MIA service+cash only+smoked meat served after 10:30 AM daily"

The meat was so juicy and tender it literally melts in your mouth. We also shared the poutine, which was really tasty as well!Would definitely recommend!"

Honestly guys the dine in always has lines ups minimum 30- 1 hour wait+ skip the line and go to take out side- you can order the same thing and cut the wait time. Also can purchase meat to go (bring a cooler if you're visiting) and their spices. I love the steak rub can put that in anything (pasta, steak etc). Be sure when you're ordering the sandwich to get the fatty pieces. If you don't say they will most likely give you the lean pieces and generally more dry."

/user_details?userid=skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",5 star rating,"In my humble opinion, the Montreal-style smoked pastrami sandwich at Fumare is one of the two best things you can eat in Chicago (the other being the best burger in America at Au Cheval). In addition, as a native Texan, I don't take my smoked meats lightly, particularly the holy grail of smoked meats, the brisket. There's the context.So of course I was excited to try the O.G. of Montreal-style smoked pastrami sandwiches (the Viande Fumée) in Montreal, the legendary Schwartz's. Long story short, it did not disappoint. Fresh off a healthy night of copious refreshments, our ragtag group sought something greasy and delicious, only to be met with a ridiculously long line squirreling out both ends at Schwartz's. Popular, this place apparently is. We deftly split into two, with a couple folks waiting in each line of roughly equal length. Spoiler alert: the to-go line moves much faster.With a few bags of greasy-delicious sandwiches and a plethora of black cherry soda, we took a short hike to the nearest park, stole some seats on a bench, and promptly devoured the meatacular sandwiches. I'm sure it was quite a sight. Like Texas brisket, like Fumare's amazing sandwich, there's nothing special about the setup except for the tender loving care dedicated to producing the tenderest, most succulent, melts like butter, tastes like heaven, meat you can make. That's the rub at Schwartz's. It's all about the meat, and everything else is just dressing for show."

It would be like going to Texas and not having BBQ.Schwartz's is a Jewish Delicatessen serving smoked meat among other things. The interior is simple with many wooden tables placed closely together. It appears that the restaurant is almost always packed. We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated however.Since we had dinner reservations later that night, we decided to just eat lightly.We had the smoked meat sandwich which was piled high with thick slices of fatty brisket. The sandwich is relatively simple with the only condiment being mustard. The meat has a definite ""beefy"" flavor with extra richness from the nice fat cap. The mustard helps to cut through some of the fattiness however.It is also hard to go to Canada without having poutine. The French fries were nicely crisp, topped with squeaky cheese curds and smothered in gravy.The meal at Schwartz's Deli definitely hit the spot. I would like to try other smoked meat restaurants the next time I am in Montreal in order to see what else is out there."

This place looks like a little deli. I'm still surprised at how many people they shoved into this small area. The menu is limited but why come here for anything else but smoked meat, its what they are famous for! We each got the smoked meat sandwich, a coke and giant pickle. Surprisingly this sandwich is huge and amazing!I'm still not really sure what kind of mean is exactly on this sandwich. Maybe is a cross between corned beef and brisket? It sure is delicious though and it comes out served with a slap of mustard served on a type of rye bread. This reminds me of the perfect hangover or drunk sandwich! I would also recommend a pickle they are huge and delicious! The best part about it we were seated, ate, and cashed out in about 15 mins!

The smoked meat sandwich was quite messy to eat. An abundant of meat stuffed right in between two small fragile slices of bread covered in mustard. A very simple sandwich yet very delicious and filling! The meat was very, very VERY tender. The BEST smoked meat I've had yet! I wasn't too crazy for the poutine.. Fries were on the soggy side however, gravy was good. I mean, Schwartz is largely known for their smoked meat after all..

It's similar to the quality you'd get at Katz in NYC, albeit with a better price.However, I do want to express a major concern I had with this establishment being cash only. I was visiting from out of town and had not exchanged any money as most of Montreal is very debit/credit card friendly. One of the men behind the counter told me to use the ATM machine inside the establishment, which is in the back near the bathroom. I checked the machine for a skimmer and it seemed pretty legit. I used my card, withdrew cash to pay with no problems. However yesterday (about three weeks after my visit) I received a call from my Bank letting me know my debit card information was stolen from an ATM I used while traveling in Montreal. That ATM was the only ATM I ever used during my time abroad. It's a bit concerning that the only ATM available in an establishment frequented by tourists is compromised. I highly recommend the staff get this sorted out. Otherwise, make sure to bring cash that you acquired securely from your own bank, an affiliate, or a reputable currency exchange place."

The first bite of that moist and smokey meat had me prancing around like a little girl in the shop. It was juicy, tender, smokey, and taste like pure cow heaven. It was in fact, sooooo good, that I devoured it within seconds and was eager to order their sausages as well. The sausages was juicy, savory, crunchy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside. If you are an hour away, you should go to this place.

Waiting for 10 min for a table is fine, but standing in a long line in the street for a restaurant is a no-no. There are way too many excellent restaurants in the city for that.

You'd expect to have some phenomenal sandwich that melts in your mouth. But you do not.

I almost gave this place a 4 star rating but  I'm not getting peer pressured to jump on the bandwagon if it wasn't quite there for me. While the smoked meat was delish, the sandwich was really bare. I understand the meat should be the center of attention but a sandwich with no cheese, tomatoes or lettuce just isn't a sandwich at all. Layers of meat, a tiny splat of mustard and soft thin bread? C'mon. The lines are long for that?? The bread could've at least been toasted, give me a little more mustard and throw some lettuce on that bad boy cuz otherwise it was dry as hell no matter how juicy the meat was. If you must try it to know for yourself, skip the dine in line and go straight to the take out spot. There's some standing room space in the back or go across the street where there's outdoor seating. Do you really ~need~ to dine in for a sandwich and fries?"

Tender, perfectly seasoned, not salty or bland, the fat isn't greasy but makes great fusion with the lean in terms of texture and aroma. Black cherry soda: 4/5. Thought it'd taste like Dr. Pepper but nooooooo it was good.Poutine and coleslaw and pickle: 3.5/5. Not different from other standard diner."

Line-up outside of Schwartz's is massive regardless of the time of day. The Hebrew Delicatessen is worshiped by tourists and locals alike. Schwartz is a well-oiled machine. I am surprised Harvard Business Review has yet to study Schwartz's. The processes result in a sustainable advantage in the marketplace. VRIO FrameworkValue: Neutralizes external threats with unique mandatory 10 day meat curing time and high inventory turnover. Smoked meat sandwiches are served by fat content: lean, medium and fat. The theory of YOLO (You Only Live Once) suggests fat. As well, the theory of YOLO also suggests a cheesy smoked meat poutine, the ingestion of your weekly fat intake in one sitting. Rarity: Patrons love Schwartz's like fat kids love pie. Limited supply and persistence over time are contributions to its recipe of success.  Expect a plate of succulent smoked meat. Imitability: Schwartz's brand is inimitable. The ""hole in the wall"" décor speaks to its 80 years of history.  This even allows Schwartz's to add merchandizes to its product mix. Organization: Complementary capabilities of staff, supplier and culture. The orders are cascaded in a transparent reporting structure. Don't forget to complete your meal with artificially flavoured black cherry soda!  Disturbing an 80 years-old carefully designed product mix tradition is bad karma!"

The oldest deli in Canada and a true Montreal landmark situated on Boul St Laraunt - another famous destination!Be prepared to line up no matter time or day of the week. ""Even if you are Angelina Jolie"" their words not mine. Major tourist site - therefore lots of people wanting to get in. At the door you are greeted by one of the servers- can't go in until there's a spot to sit. Once in your seating is based on availability. You may be making friends with fellow tourists or patrons right away- elbow to elbow. You can choose to sit at the front bar like area if there's room. Place is filled with history- check out walls of many news paper clippings. Service is good with funny waiters and they don't mind picture taking in fact they offer to take your picture once the food is placed in front of you.I'd prob say look up the menu before going so you can make a choice right away- it gets very overwhelming with many people and fast service. We choose the original smoked meat sandwich-very small white bread slices packed with overflowing layers of smoked meat. Your choice for additional condiments. Comes already with a side of huge pickle. There one home style drink- Cherry coke. Other options if not your thing. We ordered side of small fries. Spices on the meat can't go wrong. Remember - only take cash so make sure you have that on hand . Also take out and store right beside. Fast service and there's options to take home packaged meat and sauces.

As in anxiety-inducing-claustrophobic-cramped.4. Food: ""meh"" I was sorely disappointed by my experience at Schwartz's. Having heard so much about it and all the reviews is what drove me to go give it a try; however, the entire experience was lackluster. As some other reviews state, the store is small and clustered - jamming in *multiple* guests to one table. My group (of 2) was seated at the same table, shoulder to shoulder, with another group (of 4). Even on one of their less-busy nights, the ""cramming in"" of guests was taken to another level. The server was nice, but was obviously exhausted from racing around non-stop to get to everyone. The cashier was not as nice. She didn't even look up from her phone before telling us ""cash only - there's an ATM in the back"". Now, all of that aside, we were really hoping the food would justify why this place is so praised! We ordered the #4 (the ""famous"" Smoked Meat Sandwich), a side of fries, and a coleslaw. All of the above could only be described as ""meh"". The meat had flavor, but a stack of meat with a teaspoon of mustard between 2 *un*toasted pieces of bread is hardly worthwhile. The fries and coleslaw were equally disappointing. Overall, the place looked and felt as though nothing has changed, or upgraded, since they first opened. It was definitely a cramped, over decorated deli in desperate need of a makeover - breathing room for starters. Maybe its the nostalgia that keeps people coming back, but I unfortunately didn't feel the same. I was really hoping for something special."

You have to eat here if you ever get a chance to visit Montreal. Been here 3 times at it's just as delicious as the first. Get the smoked meat sandwich and ask for medium fat. You can get less fat or more fat, but in between is where the money's at. It's piled on top of rye bread and topped with mustard. I never liked mustard until I had it with some Schwartz's smoked meat! The poutine is just as delicious - the perfect side. If you have a large group forget about getting a table without a long wait. 2 or less is ideal for dining in because you'll likely get a counter seat, but we still had a 20 minute wait at 1pm on a Saturday.

However, its reputation is as strong as ever and you can now even find Schwartz in select grocery stores. I've eaten here about a dozen times in my life but it has never been my favorite place for smoked meat and the last few years the quality I received was questionable. The last visit consisted of one of the most underwhelming smoked meat sandwich I've ever had the misfortune to eat. My sandwich was dry and very fatty. The flavor wasn't there and honestly it was gross! It's as if they served me a leftover sandwich from other sandwiches so it didn't go to waste. My friend didn't like his as well and his cut was definitely better than mine.It's simply not worth coming here with recent experiences, the line-ups and the fact I always have to share my table. It's just too much of a hassle for what you get.Frankly, it's a tourist trap and it's known place for out of towners to seek that ""famed Montreal smoked meat sandwich"" without doing any level of adequate research.

If the line is too long, try The Main right across the street. If you are adventurous, go to Smoke Meat Pete; it is the crown right now.

That's all I can say.If you add more mustard to the sandwich, it takes things to another level. The kick from the mustard along with the juiciness of the meat makes for an unbelievable taste. I also got a side of cole slaw that was equally delicious.The meat is already prepared and comes out within five minutes of ordering it. It's a mom and pop type of restaurant that can get a little cramped, but is well worth it. It's also shared seating, so you'll likely be sitting next to strangers at your table. Also worth noting, they only take cash.This is one of those places that you have to try once in your life. It's truly an experience you won't forget."
/user_details?userid=3xlBfGV9vFUmZapiT5NPfg,Nelson C.,"Burnaby, Canada",4 star rating,They are famous for their sandwhich for a reason.   It's REALLY GOOD!  Probably the best Montreal smoked meat sandwhich that I've ever had in my life.    The poutine wasn't great but it was passable and not much more to upgrade to in your combo.  But the sandwhich made the line up and everything worth it!  Paired up with the cherry cola it made my day.

Numerous delis, sandwich shops and restaurants in NYC (and I'm sure elsewhere) serve tastier pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. The more famous shops charge close to $20 U. S. a sandwich while Schwartz only charges around $10 Canadian though the sandwich at Schwartz is quite a bit smaller. The smoked meat at Schwartz is quite lean and the seasoning is a bit bare bones.  It is not bad but I wouldn't drive out of my way during a visit to Montreal for a smoked meat sandwich from here. On the other hand the smoked meat poutine was very tasty with a delicious gravy, fries and cheese providing moisture to compliment the lean bits of smoked meat. I felt it was a lot more worth the close to $10 price tag it shares with the smoked meat sandwich.This is something the shops back in NYC definitely don't provide. I love Montréal!"

Not being a meat eater I accompanied my boyfriend to this restaurant that's been serving smoked meat sandwiches since the 20s. The size of the sandwich was smaller than I thought but it was filled with a LOT of meat.  A little pricey in my opinion but then again I didn't eat it but I've heard great things. My boyfriend being from New York said it reminded him of Katz. I asked him which was better he said Katz but that may be a little biased.

The sandwich was small and could have been hotter but was definitely good. The poutine was just meh, kind of standard. I don't think this is one of the best sandwiches I've had but this is coming from someone who lives in NYC where there are landmarks for pastrami sandwiches like Katz. However, I will say this is a tasty little bite nonetheless."

If it is your first time, go with the classic smoked meat sandwich, pickles, fries, and black cherry coke. You can't go wrong with the basics! The meat was moist and full of flavor. You get different layers of lean and fatty slices of meat in each bite. I think they make a point to include different cuts of meat in each layer.  A little extra mustard provided at the table makes the sandwich even more delicious! Take a bite of the extra tart pickle in between and some fries. As busy as they were, our server was friendly and took the time to make small talk with us to get to know us a bit. This is a great spot to check out for bachelor parties after a night of drinking."

We found ourselves standing in line for a good 5-10 minutes before we realized there is a separate to-go deli, and we were standing in line for the restaurant. There is causal seating at the back of the deli, so this is definitely the way to go. Honestly, I'm not a hugeee fan of pastrami, and that's what I thought Schwartz's was. It looks like pastrami. It sounds like Katz's in NYC. But... this is not pastrami. It's smoked meat. And apparently it's a thing in Montreal (I had no idea). Serious Eats has a great article on smoked meat vs pastrami, specifically Schwartz's vs Katz's. A good read if you're curious!I'm a New Yorker, but honestly, I liked Schwartz's sandwich more.

No matter where I go, Brynd in Quebec City or other joints claiming they have smoked meat, it has never compared to how amazing their corned beef is!After you wait the hour or so line outside to even reach the counter, you'll have the choice of how fatty or lean (or in between) you want your sandwich to be. It's placed in between 2 TINY slices of rye that I believe is just there to house the brick of corned beef you're about to devour. It was a bit difficult to find seating, and ended up grabbing 3 bar chairs along the wall in the back. Be sure you have a bottle of mustard right next to you when you eat this. A little squirt with every bite made me the happiest person and I recall every memory of this place as I write this 3 years later after running into this photo while cleaning out my phone."

When all set and done i asked for my check to two different people only to be told to ask the original server that was at the bar.... the problem was, that server had goned missing for at least 10 minutes. Mind you this was not a super busy time of the day (3 pm). All in all, i think this place feels more like a tourist trap, and for the small piece of sandwich your get for 10.75, it was just ok at best. Your customer service is what killed the experience."

However, it went quickly and we were seated at a table with other patrons (super small place and utilitarian in style). We quickly realized this  was a Jewish deli serving up what is akin to a corned beef sandwich on rye, which was decent, but I wasn't as enamored as the locals. Maybe having had great corned beef sandwiches in New York and Miami have spoiled me. The service was great, though, they don't rush you, and they let you choose the level of fat/leanness you want in the meat."

I felt like we were in a boxcar as we sat at a table that we shared with a family of 4. Not so bad, sure there's a little awkward conversation at first and maybe an unintentional photobomb or two, but those are first world problems.   Don't expect a menu because it's up on the wall. It's small. Meat, meat, more meat and a few sides. We started with the poutine. Not their strength. Soggy fries, though they tasted like real potato fries and I wished we had opted for the plain fries.We ordered the meat sandwich (lean), clever name you might add and yes it is their famed beef brisket sandwich served on humble slices of a baguette. Always looking to diversify my options I ordered the turkey sandwich, big mistake. It was deli turkey, tough texture, and flavorless.  I wish we had just ordered another meat sandwich. So in the end I'm glad we went because the beef was delicious and unlike anything I've ever had but with so much good food in Montreal it's hard to say this is a must do if you only have a limited number of meals in the city."

It definitely hit the spot and I loved the tenderness of the beef and how it was seasoned. Everything went well together. In the end it got a little dry, but just put some mustard in the sandwich and that'll solve your problem! The portions were pretty big in my opinion as well...So for $9.60 that's a pretty good deal for me.

Of course, order the smoke meat sandwich as that's what they're known for. The waiter is going to ask if you want mustard on the side - that's up to you.

We noticed that there was a take out section so we went there. Pro tip: if you are here just to enjoy the sandwich and aren't big on the whole experience save yourself time and go to the take out, you can order a sandwich and fries with all the fixings and take your meal to the back where they have a few chairs and tables. Another tip, take see meat home. They slice them fresh and place them in sealed bags. Heating is easy and you get to enjoy sandwiches well after vacation and give yourself a little flashback to the good old times. Staff was very friendly and you can tell they have been doing this a while. I will say, if you decide to wait online, it seemed that the line doesove fairly quickly. When we exited, the crowd around us standing in line we're already inside, but I can't say how the line looks once youre inside.

The slaw was very tasty. It was not the creamy variety, but rather a clear vinegar version. This is a very small old restaurant. We waited in about a half hour queue to get in at 13:00. I hear the queue can be up to an hour. The service is quick and not too friendly, but they are trying to push the crowds through. Maybe they do not have too many Jewish style deli restaurants in Montreal. That's why the Long queues????The food was good, but not that much better than the typical Jewish style deli in the states that I have dined in.

What I didn't know was that I was about to eat some of the best meat I've ever had in my life.I ordered the viande fumée and chose the medium option (being not too lean, not too fatty). Along with that, I ordered a plate of fries to share with the table. I already had a good feeling about this place due to the long line that extended outside of the door. Although it appeared long, the line took no longer than 5 minutes to get through. Once inside, my family was seated with another family at a six person table, since the staff had to save space for other customers.All in all, it took about 4 minutes to get my food from the moment I ordered, which is amazing considering the quality of the food and the plethora of other customers. As for the sandwich, I was blown away by the quality and taste. The meat was perfectly flavored, not too salty, nor too ""meaty"". When chewing, I noticed an extremely pleasant consistency that allowed for easy chewing. Being a smoked meat, it had a nice woody taste that I definitely enjoyed. The fries were above average, yet nothing to be blown away by. My only complaint is that the sandwich was quite hard to eat, since there was an overwhelming amount of meat compared to the sturdiness of the white bread, yet this sounds almost like a benefit disguised as a negative. Quick service and personable staff was just the cherry on the top. I definitely look forward to coming here again."

The bread is light and delicious and the crust is not too hard. The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth. The mustard adds just the right amount of tang to the sandwich.

There's no denying this place is one of the culinary institutions of Montreal, and its brisket's hype is fairly well-deserved. But having lived around the corner for years, I never go.Why? Well, any smart local scoffs (or laughs) at the massive line of people in front of Schwartz's. There are enough solid smoked meat joints in the city that lining up for more than 5-10 minutes seems absurd. ""Oh jeez, poor tourists"", you'll hear someone say as they walk past a line of 50+ people standing on the sidewalk during a sweltering summer afternoon. Schwartz's is good, but not THAT good. Combine the ridiculous line with the fact that both the atmosphere and service sucks, doesn't make for a place I yearn for (if you like blinding fluorescent lighting and being pushed out the door before you've finished eating, you might like it though).If you do happen to find yourself in a giant line out front of Schwartz's, do yourself a favour...walk directly across the street to the Main Deli.

Old school Jewish Delicatessen vibe, no thrills decor, and that mouth watering scent of meat when you walk through the door. We had a group of 20 guys (for a bachelor party) and went to Scwartz's around noon on a Saturday. The line was long but moved extremely quickly - this may have to do with there only being 3 sandwiches to choose from - either way, we destroying our smoked meat on Rye within 20 minutes. Bread: Not the traditional Jewish rye I am used to -  it was a softer, smaller version of the classic deli sandwich bread. Meat: Succulent and you really get a variety of type in your sandwich (finely chopped, thinly sliced, etc)  - the burnt fatty ends were the highlight. The sandwich itself is smaller then your NYC Delis, but the price reflects that as well. The one knock I have was the brown mustard was not available as a free condiment. They do sell the brown mustard in a bottle, which was a little frustrating as I expected it to be available for free."

As much as I love Schwartz and it will always exemplify the ""taste"" of Montreal to me (along with Fairmont's bagels), I have to give it 4 stars because I'm also pretty disappointed that they haven't expanded or made the restaurant moree... let's say, 'user-friendly'. This isn't a knock on the business, because I can defend them if they said they just want to keep the same traditional feel to the place. I just won't be able to enjoy eating inside for a couple of years because my son is 7months old. It would be a disaster if we brought him in to eat because his stroller and diaper bag would take up the entire table.I always believed in the notion that if you build it, they will come. And just like any business, in order to ensure its continued success, it must constantly improve. The food needs ZERO improvement. That's the one thing that I hope stays traditional forever.

I opted for the middle option (some fat, some lean) and it was delicious. Food came out super quick and paired with fresh, hot fries and a pickle, it was an extremely satisfying meal.

We waited in line outside for approx. 20 mins, not that bad but thankfully it wasn't freezing outside. My group all got the typical smoked meat sandwich and a side order of fries. I thought it was pretty cool how we had the option to choose between lean, reg, or fatty meat! Most of us chose regular. The sandwiches came pretty fast and so did the fries. In my honest opinion, there wasn't anything that WOW'd me about the sandwich. It got very messy real fast. I liked the fries so much more and I wish I got an extra plate of fries instead of a sandwich. Which is why I gave here a 4 stars, had I not gotten the fries I probably would give the sandwich 3 stars (sorry) Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but if I bring other friends to Montreal and they want to try out Schwartz, I'll definitely be getting a huge plate of fries."

It looks tiny when you get it (smaller than a Subway 6-inch), but actually it's quite filling because the whole thing is filled with meat. It tastes very similar to pastrami, but is slightly drier and less sweet, and has a few herbs and spices that are not found in typical pastrami. There is an eat-in restaurant and a to-go place; I got it to go because there was a long line to eat in."

Montréal smoked meat is made by salting and curing brisket with spices and using some sort of delicious wizardry. We had heard that Schwartz's was an institution in Montréal and the frequent line down the street solidifies this claim. We were lucky enough to drive by on our way out of town and when we saw there was no line we decided to go for it.We picked up a few sandwiches for the ride home and because of this we were able to skip dinner. This was our second encounter with this awesome creation; after having it under eggs and hollandaise at Restaurant l'avenue, we had to give it a shot in its most famous incarnation - on rye bread with house-made mustard. We are glad we were able to squeeze this into our trip and our mouths are watering thinking about it, so check 'em out!If you check out Scwartz's on Yelp, you'll find the main complaints to be about long lines and limited space. So if you're impatient and/or claustrophobic, don't try to go during lunch hours and get your grub to go!You can also check out Scwartz's website, though there really is no need - get the smoked meat, the menu is irrelevant.If you think smoked meat sounds similar to pastrami, we have no idea what the difference is - but the guy who wrote this article does, so read it if you're curious!thedrunkenduo.com"

Parking seems to work out okay there's usually a spot on the street and don't forget to use your credit/ debit or cash at the meters, you will get a ticket in Montreal.                      I am lucky to say I have yet to experience a huge line or any line for that matter at Schwartz's ! I've always had timing that I sit right down at one of the large tables side by other people, or at the bar, it all works.  I order the medium sandwich, my fiancé likes to try the platter, it's pilled high half a fresh loaf sliced rye bread, a plate mounded with the tender smoked meat.  I always add more of the mustard thats on the table.. success.  We share a fries, and a couple of waters. We have also tried the steak platter as a appetizer  and its good and flavorful, but the great is in the smoked meat sandwich. My sis likes a cherry coke to make her meal complete.  The customer service is great, I personally like the old school look of the uniforms and the whole inside in itself, posters and framed articles galore!   I asked the cashier about Celine Dion and ownership, she told me its Renee her husband who shows up now and then, and one time Celine came in and bought the entire restaurant's lunch that day, which is a nice gesture.  The bathrooms are tiny tiny so I'm sure no big people can use the bathrooms here.  Remember to bring cash here! They do have an ATM inside, and there are ATM's outside nearby as well, but save yourself the hassle. They also welcome Canadian and American money, both with a Canadian currency outcome.Of all Smoked meat I've had Schwartz is for sure the best hands down. My fiance is a fan now too.

I know the reason is not due to revenue shortage cause this place is packed all day long. Open a second location or expand! It's simple business practice. You may not want to grow but your customers do so open that other location and donate all the proceeds to the mass of homeless if you don't want the money.

The first time, the take out next door was closed so we just asked for take out from the restaurant instead. They did have plenty of available tables but we just wanted to enjoy these delicious sandwiches in the confines of our hotel. I did expect the sandwiches to be like a foot high like the ones from Katz, but this was more on the smaller side. Although, it is a lot cheaper than Katz. Definitely ask for medium or else they give you lean meat. The brisket was tender and flavorful. We also tried the fries and they gave us packets of vinegar and ketchup. I never had fries with vinegar before but it did go well. They were crispy and fresh just like the ones from Pomme Frites in NYC. I do regret not trying their poutine though. On the second visit, we experienced a HUGE line for the restaurant as well as the take out next door. Guess it really depends on what time you go.

/user_details?userid=58zhqwfGYEl92MZusTsYJg,NYSD G.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Schwartz vs. Katzfirst time trying smoked meat was Dunn's in Vancouver. so the first thing we ate while in Montreal for the Gran Prix was the infamous Schwartz's smoked meat, but before the visit i read some articles (Montreal vs NYC) of how Schwartz's was better,... better even than the king of all jewish delis,... Katz in NYC. now if i've never had smoked meat or a Katz pastrami before to compare especially 4 days later, I would've agreed, but I have and did. tinyurl.com/Montreal-vs-… first... schwartz's smoked meat vs dunns is not the same. dunns was more pastrami like in seasonings and flavor, while schwartz's is more corned beef. to the new there's a huge difference in look but even more important, in taste. pastrami is bolder, smokier, and one they forgot... ""darker"",... not just in its crust... but the color of the meat. pastrami also uses the naval, and corned beef uses the brisket, and there is a difference in texture and a bite.and to the point of this review. the writers and bloggers in the link does not know what they are talking about, or they forgot to use the word preference. mind you ive only had smoked meat twice (Vancouver and Montreal) and Katz countless times while in NY (25yrs). one could even say that i'm a bit bias, but i haven't had a Katz pastrami since 2012, and while ive had other delis in LA in between, i haven't tasted a katz pastrami for nearly 3 years so my palate has been pretty much Katz's free. i think im able to make a fair comparison having had both in a span of 4 days, and if Schwartz's was better I have no problem stating that. nothing on this planet comes close to a Katz Pastrami,... noth-innng. not even Katz corned beef can touch their pastrami. even if you say that you've had both, my next question,.... how many days apart and did you have it to stay while it was still hot. i will upload two pictures of both sandwiches and feel free to message me who looks better, and tell me which one would make you run out and get one. also one was close to room temp and the other a bit warmer cause of the steamers they use before slicing (Katz).other differences is their choice of mustard, Katz uses what we call deli mustard (spicy) and Schwartz's uses yellow. ordered the smoked meat ""medium"" with no mustard and Katz ""juicy"" also no mustard, but one was on rye the other on club bread (NYC). both looked juicy and both had a very distinct and different aroma. based on smell alone, Katz made my mouth water more and i was hungrier while at Schwartz's. texture its Katz all the way. brisket when cooked too long will fall to pieces, and that's why its used for american slow smoked BBQ. Katz was like biting into an aged prime cut of steak cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.you really can't go wrong with either one, but it comes down to if you like bolder vs milder. if you like Nirvana in your taste buds then its Katz, but if you like Vivaldi then its Schwartz's. with or without mustard Katz wins the flavor and taste test for me because its ""very ape"" in every bite. when it comes to juiciness its a draw, and you can see how juicy both sandwiches are in my pics. one aspect we did like at Schwartz's they don't allow you to pile on BS toppings like cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw or sauerkraut like Katz's. great deli is like a great steak, its great on its own. the only thing on both should be a super light schmear of mustard in a bite. that's why its always best to order no mustard so you can add it accordingly on every bite. plus it allows you to taste the meat on its own. we did like the vinegar based Montreal coleslaw vs the mayo based, and we both said we could eat that with anything. the pickles could be more sour cause it was like eating wet cucumbers. in the end both sandwiches are great in their own right and it will come down to preference. in fact both places are so a like that when I walked in Schwartz I thought I was walking into a smaller Katz which was a good thing."

/user_details?userid=EUURIykeFyVPzgch89evGg,Vinny H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"""You haven't been to Schwartz's?"" and ""You must go to Schwartz's!"" were among the comments from various people about this place before i decided to go. So one Saturday evening i decided to join the masses and have my own say on it. The place: The establishment has two different sides a take out and sit in and if you are going there for the first time sit in is a must as the ambiance is half the experience. From the outside you can't see much except that there is always a lot of activity around it. There is meat that in the window and most of the other windows are steamed up probably from the meat sweats and excitement from people inside. This adds to the place as you cant really see inside. We went around 5 o clock and it was very busy however we were seated straight away. You could tell there was something special about this place as soon as you walk in. You might have to wait if you have group (4+) however they turn over the tables quite fast. Food: So like anyone going for the first time, I went for the classic smoked meat sandwich a dill pickle and fries. It came out within about 7 minutes maybe less. I went for the extra fatty version because you know ""When in Rome"". My eyes could not believe it when it came out, there was a substantial amount of meat with a small bit of mustard and two slices of bread however you have to realize when you come here that this place is about the meat. The taste was amazing, so flavorsome and juicy with every bite. Adding a bit of extra mustard can be useful as its quite heavy. You could tell that the meat has been aged for a very long time the meat was very tender. The dill pickle was good but probably not worth $2.10 for it. We finished our meal in about 10 minutes. The price in total was about 15 dollars. I would highly recommend this place especially if your only in Montreal for a weekend and your looking for a meat fix. Its one to remember."

However, there are better places for subsequent visits with shorter lineups.The lines are long, usually a 45min wait during peak hours and the seating area is crowded. It's definitely a go in, eat, get out, joint. There are three options for the sandwich: fatty (the juiciest), medium and lean. On this past visit, I got the fatty sandwich, the French fries, coleslaw, a dill pickle and a Colts cherry cola. The ""classic"" meal. It was a lot of food. The sandwich was meaty and the meat melted in my mouth. The fries were well cooked, and warm right out of the fryer. Everything else was simply mediocre, hence the ranking. If you're coming for the sandwich you won't be disappointed, they are consistent with the smoked meat. Everything else is a toss of the coin. This place is worth trying once, but with other places around with similar quality, once might be enough."

I've been to Schwartz a couple of times and most visits presented me with a juicy fat-gushing sandwich. Despite offering very good smoked meats, I'll explain you why I'll never return. Like always, I order a fatty smoked meat sandwich but during recent stops my sandwich was more than sad. It was dry sad. How can the fattiest option for a sandwich be Sahara dry? Both my girlfriend's and mine had dehydrated boards of meat. I asked the waiter why these barks of protein are so dry. He responded with ""Oh it's normal"". Just because I'm asian it doesn't mean that I'm a tourist. The meat was no different from eating leftover chicken breast that was nuked in the microwave - texture wise. A copious amount of mustard had to be added to lubricate the food. It seemed like the sandwiches had leftover or bad pieces of meat in them. They even had the audacity to sprinkle 1/3rd of my sandwich with meat croutons that were probably fallen crumbles from slicing this morning's meat. It was clearly not fresh as the meat was almost black and had a shiny hard shell very similar to beef jerky. I've had the same sandwich numerous times before and the quality has never been this terrible to the point where it's comparable to the STM winter services.I shit you not, I was so dissapointed that I had to make a stop to the nearby Second Cup to cleanse my palette with a brownie. Excellent service at that coffee shop by the way. Shout out to the tattooed redhead girl and the hipster janitor for bleaching the bad experience for us. If you're willing to gamble $10 for a sandwich don't be surprised if your money and your meal goes down the drain. To the guys at Schwartz: I've literally had juicier beef jerky at Couche Tard. We can all laugh about this review but seriously, get your shit together. No girls would enjoy their meat dry."

Choose from lean, regular, or fatty beef, which will come between two pieces of rye and a slather of yellow ballpark mustard.  By ""choose"", I really mean that you should choose the fatty variety.  Just do it - you won't regret it. Moist, tender, truly smoked, pinkish beef is piled high between the bread.  I came here a few hours after Boullion Bilk and was considering stealing a bite off my friends.  Luckily, the friendly waitstaff encouraged* me to get my own sandwich.* By encourage, I mean the gentleman basically threw the gauntlet by claiming he could eat 3 by himself so surely I would be able to finish 1.Am so glad I took that challenge, because I would be kicking myself right now if I hadn't. In fact, I regret not having gone back again for more.  But ehh, I suppose my arteries will thank me for it later. If you don't speak or read French, not to worry, the lit menu on the wall is short, has the English version below it, and the staff have zero problems with English.  They're super used to tourists too, so they'll let you know what you should order.  Here's a hint: it's gonna be the smoked beef. You can pay at the front or at your table.  Cash only.  Open until 2am, so come here late at night just cause you can!"

It's an institution and it's the sort of restaurant that does exactly one thing. The meat is flavorful and tasty. I'm not sure it's quite in the 5-star range of being something that I'd travel out of my way for; my personal taste prefers pastrami (I value spice over salt).

I don't think a trip to Montreal actually counts unless you visit Schwartz's, but apparently a LOT of other people feel the same. The menu is limited and its a strictly a cash only business but that does not seem to deter anyone.We arrived to find ourselves about fifty people back in line. However, we may have gotten lucky as within about five minutes someone came out and advised that there was room for four at the counter. Suprisingly everyone ahead of us declined - although they are specific to state it had to be a party of four. When you're this busy you cannot afford any empty seats apparently.Perhaps the food tastes better at a table but I find it hard to believe. The sandwiches and pountine were absolutely amazing and none of my many trips here has every disappointed. Sure, they're not cheap and their might be better Montreal smoked meat out there - but this place is great and a real institution. While I've never done it myself, those pressed for time might consider the take out option and picnic nearby - weather permitting. Over-hyped? Perhaps, but the staff is always friendly, the food consistently good and places like Schwartz's seem to be disappearing so I plan to continue to visit every time I get the chance!"

This time we decided to go to Schwartz''s.  No lines and plenty of tables.  We sat down and ordered a large platter of old fashioned smoked meat  and a large French fries. Much to my dismay the MEAT came cold and a bit tough.  The fries were warm and greasy as they are supposed to be.   When we received the bill I was very surprised to see a charge for SHARING.  The  platter came with no less than 10 slices of bread.  No one person can eat all the bread and close to a pound of meat. The waiter said to us that management gets pissed off if they don't charge $1.75 for sharing. Had we been told when we first ordered our food at least we would have had a choice and maybe ordered two small platters.  I feel we should have been told and not just find it on the bill. They just lost a patron for the future.

The smoked meat used the right part of beef with both lean and fat texture (not fatty after being smoked), and it was cut evenly. The flavor, however, lacked a bit of flamboyance that outstanding smoked meat could have offered. There was not much complexity to the taste that was possible for such meat. The cherry soda helped--I do not like it when drinking alone, but it somehow magically tasted better with the smoked meat."

/user_details?userid=hPNvRl4jAXsYoBAAhudRrA,Scott S.,"Salem, OR",5 star rating,"I was raised as a devout Christian until the age of about 13 when I decided I would rather not spend two minutes before every meal appealing to a deity who I didn't believe in or spend Sundays uncomfortably sitting next to strangers who seemed to like to give away money to tax-free organizations whose pockets seemed to continue swelling while the ""missions"" they supported seemed to keep suffering in comparison.My gripes with organized religion aside, until I went to college, my impression of Jewish food consisted only of things that were somewhat hinted in the bible about the Israelites' travails in the desert -- I think up until about 18 I believed that the story of the Jews were that of an overzealous nation led by a capricious voice in the sky who pretty much gave and took away land from his/her own people, while at the same time depriving them culinarily by forcing them to eat unleavened bread and order well-done steaks all the time.I was pleasantly surprised, when I was first introduced to a proper reuben at Schilo's Deli in San Antonio, and my perception and admiration of Jewish cuisine had been on the rise ever since then; from that point I made it a point to pilgrimage all the holy sites of all that is bagel and/or smoked meat -- I never even once would have imagined that one of those holy sites would have been in the beautiful city of Montréal.If you've read this far in my review, you'll notice that I have yet to make a single constructive comment that would be construed as being part of a review. That's because I haven't. I can't quite put into words what I think about Schwartz's, because it's so very much like every landmark Jewish deli I've been to, but at the same time so different as well.The atmosphere at Schwartz's is one you'd expect from any popular establishment in a bustling city. I've walked and passed by Schwartz's at least four times and each time there was a huge line in front of both the restaurant and the take out area. Whereas the take out area is indeed miles faster than waiting in line to be seated at the restaurant, you still have to wait about 30-35 minutes to get your hands on any sort of tangible food while having to suffer through the alluring aroma of freshly-drained, smoked-for-many-hours meat invading ever orifice of your body as you stand (yes, your dog will love the way you smell after you leave this place)The food here is mindblowing if you've never tried a brisket/smoked meat sandwich before. If you have, it's just like anything you'd get at Katzs'/Second Ave/Herschel's, except Schwartz's sandwich packs in around the same amount of meat as the aforementioned places (except for Second Ave's. Nothing beats a whole pound of brisket sloshed in between two pieces of rye bread) into three tiny pieces of white, almost wonderbread-esque bread (think Texas BBQ.) It's almost like a poorly constructed Pyramid that was built to preserve a cow that met a horrifying death, and if that wasn't enough, incinerated extremely slowly so to keep all its juices locked into the flesh. Disturbing mental images aside, it's pretty amazing.The price point is probably what sets Schwartz's apart from most of the Jewish delis I've been to. Whereas you'll come out of places like Katzs' and Second Ave about 20-25 dollars poorer after a meal, Schwartz's only charges 7.75 CAD per sandwich. One can maybe make the argument that Katzs' and Second Ave makes up the difference in the amount of time you don't spend waiting for your food(nothing beats being able to walk up to the Sandwich line at Katzs', sampling the specimen from whence your sandwich meat came, and watching it being constructed right before your eyes within 2 minutes of entering the establishment.) My friend and I saw the pictures online and made the mistake of thinking that one sandwich would not be filling enough and that we'd each need to order two or three. That was also a huge mistake.All in all a great establishment in a great part of town. I'd definitely recommend Schwartz's as a part of the Montréal experience to anyone visiting the city. I don't know if their online catering/order service delivers to the US as well, but I'm really kicking myself for not grabbing one of their ready-to-heat brisket vacuum paks for my drive home."

It is worth the time and the hype because locals, tourists, everyone comes here. And bring cash...it's old school here.I was just in NYC eating a pastrami sandwich at Katz's and everyone seems to compare NY vs Montreal for deli sandwiches. Well, here's the deal - they are both great in their own ways! Only downside of Katz's is the pastrami sandwich for about the same size is $18.45 USD while the smoked meat sandwich here is $7.95 CAD.For those who might have been disappointed with their sandwich here - key is to get some fat with your smoked meat. They will ask you if you want it lean, medium or fatty.....you only live once so get the fatty cut (I did and it was love at first bite...it literally melted in my mouth) or at a minimum the medium cut. Meat was moist and not overly seasoned - just perfect....only thing is I am used to Winnipeg rye bread (which I think is the best) so the rye here was so-so in my opinion but I won't let that affect my rating for this place.Fries are crispy, coleslaw is perfectly tangy and provides a lightness to the meal if that's even possible. We waited about 40 mins in line on the Victoria Monday starting at around 1 pm. There is a take out only store beside the original restaurant but that line wasn't any better. At least we got to sit down and eat although a bit cramped. Service has it's personality and charm and food is ready relatively fast.

I recommend just going with the flow and ordering it - there's a reason that's what they're known for. The sandwich is served on rye with mustard...and that's all it needs because the meat is so flavorful. I really enjoyed the soda and got it on every visit. We did split an order of fries for the table, which were fine - but really the sandwich is the star here.I see people comparing this to the Katz's pastrami sandwich in NYC, and personally I'd rather have Shwartz's smoked meat sandwich - I just love the spices and while it's plenty filling, it isn't piled so high that you can't eat it comfortably."

Just about everyone I discussed eating options with in Montreal told me to check this place out, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. As expected there was a long line when we arrived around 3pm. It appears they play favorites to known patrons as parties with the same number of individuals that were way behind us in line were seated before we were. The service or lack thereof was definitely horrible. When we were finally seated, no one took our orders for fifteen minutes as we watched them serve those that were seated after us. Under normal circumstances we would have left but given the sacrifice we made waiting in line in the rain and the hype that led to the visit, we had to experience this ""delicacy"". When someone in our party decided to call a server's attention to the delay in taking our orders, he barked at us in French even though he had spoken to everyone else in perfectly fine English. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was rude, obnoxious and very unprofessional. Now to add salt to the wound, my sandwich was AWFUL. It was served with a whole pickle, some fries and a can of soda. The mustard coated thin bread slices were almost non-existent for the amount of salty smoked meat served. To me, a street served pastrami sandwich in New York is waaaay better. It was just A LOT OF SALTY MEAT. No one should consume that amount of sodium in a seating!All I can say is we got to to experience this tourist trap and not only was it overpriced for the quality, it was also such a waste of time for subpar food. This is a place to visit at 3am when you are completely sht-faced and need just about anything to soak up all that alcohol."

Then I walked in, sat down, bit into a fatty smoked meat sandwich, experienced extreme happiness (not as ostentatious as Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally) and sheepishly grinned. I bit my fingers and demanded another. The pickle and cole slaw were perfect complements. Sadly the black cherry soda didn't enhance the meal. The fries were overkill but were good for sharing.The smoked meat sandwiches are superior to the sandwiches at infamous NY delis, such as Katz's, 2nd Ave and Carnegie. Yes I said it.When I return, please have a medium and fatty sandwich ready for me. If the line is too long, I'll just order a pound to go.IFHTP 2"

I would say smoked meat is a lot less pepper crusted. I ordered the medium fatty cut, and it was pretty amazing.

After going back and forth several times and finally getting the order right, he said, ""that's what I said the first time but you said no"", then gave me a stare as if I'm the dumb one.

Their smoked meat sandwich is not as meaty as Katz but it is juicier and tastier. They don't have fancy sauces but yellow mustard. Surprisingly, it is good enough for all of us. Their dill is also great as well as their coleslaw. Try the black cherry soda with your sandwich and get used to being cramped inside. I would come back to Montreal just for the sandwich!"

My only issue is the bread is an afterthought. Undersized for the sandwich, would love a bit more to handle the piles of meat. Don't bother with the ""special soda"" they suggest with a generic Walmart style brand of cherry soda. Would definitely come back on my next trip to Montreal.

In any event, I knew I was among friends, AKA other people who were also excited to be eating meat sandwiches.Despite the large group ahead, the wait wasn't actually that long -- I was seated within 20-25 minutes next to another solo diner at the front counter.

When you first walk in this looks like your typical meat shop/deli all wrapped into one. I ordered the smoke meat poutine from a rather friendly/sarcastic guy behind the counter. They didn't have small to go containers so he offered the larger container and actually filled the entire thing for me and my friend (who ordered the same) at no additional charge. This had to be the best poutine I had by far while I was in Montreal.Don't know what poutine is? Well picture this: french fries (at the bottom), gravy, cheese curds, and a myriad of Montreal's famous smoked meat. This is a popular Canadian dish and you should not leave Canada without having tried it.  Towards the back of the establishment there is limited seating for patrons.

The smoked meat had the perfect amount of fat (there were no grisly pieces) and you will be tempted to order another one to share.  We tried the medium version after the fatty and we could tell the difference (fatty is king).  The cole slaw was tossed in vinegar (instead of mayo) and was the perfect side item.  Schwartz will definitely be a mandatory stop the next time I'm back in Montreal."

We all had the smoked meat sandwich, and I really appreciate that they let you chose the cut of meat: fatty, lean, or half-half. :) When our sandwiches arrived, and I bit into my sandwich it was like a chorus of singers sang with joy! The meat was perfectly seasoned, smoked, melt-in-your-mouuuuttth! The bread to meat ratio was spot-on and didn't overwhelm the palate.

The place is relatively famous thanks to the many food shows that have featured it so we figured why not!There is a gritty, New York vibe to the place, a no nonsense mixed with a friendly atmosphere. The menu is straight forward, so you can't mess that up. The staff is patient and kind, and sitting family style is just a necessity as the very small dining area is usually packed.All that said, my take away is that this place is frankly a lot of hype at the end of the day. The sandwich looks packed with smoked meat (Montreal's contribution to cured meats) but if you look carefully, it is mostly an optical illusion as the bread is seriously small. Whatever. The meat is delicious, and I would have wanted more fat but my waiter didn't give me that option. After I ordered I heard another guy ask for it and I was like, dang! So if you go, make sure to ask for the fatty cut for more flavor. If you are counting calories, what the hell are you doing here anyway?! The fries are a definite meh, and the pickle tasted weird. We noticed this at a few places in Montreal, so maybe it's a local thing, but their pickles have an odd aftertaste of sweet that fades into a cheap vinegar, like white vinegar flavor. I am used to hearty garlic German pickles, so maybe that's my problem, but I couldn't even finish it as it tasted of urine (sorry!)If you go, have fun, but realize you are just doing the tourist thing. We had fantastic smoked meats during our stay, but Schulz's wasn't one of them."

But I might like smoked meat at Schwartz even more.The meat was very juicy, we had it medium, you can get it fattier or leaner if you'd like. Loaded sandwich on rye with mustard. Meat is rosy and red, less of a bark than pastrami but perfectly smoky, rich and fatty in the right places. Also had a half-sour pickle.  One more thing: it's a lot cheaper than Katz but I guess everything is cheaper when ya leave New York. Go hear if you're a Beef nerd from New York or really, anywhere.

I live in the NY area and have been to Katz's deli. Schwartz's is better than Katz's. Some tips, prepare to wait. The lines, especially during peak hours, will be long. Not can be long, it will be long. They have two lines, one for sit in and another for take out. Here's a secret: there is also seating in the take out area. There is counter seating towards the back of the take out area. Shhh don't tell anyone! Some diehards might get mad at this post for revealing that. Also, they can put the smoked meat on top of your poutine - but only in the takeout area. They do not do this in the sit in area. However, if you do sit in and want smoked meat on your poutine, if you're nice enough, have a nice smile, and speak to your server, they may accommodate. I am 1 for 1 in convincing my server to put smoked meat on my poutine and he was nice enough to do so. Overall best smoked Montreal sandwich in all of Montreal! Prepare to wait!

That's right, it's just not any food, it's the BEST smoked meat in Canada. If you're looking for a quick bite that's delicious and savoury, get their smoked meat sandwich. $9.95 for a sandwich is pretty pricey but it's worth it! The meat is smoked for hours so when you take a bite, it literally melts in your mouth with tons of flavour. I like the marinade of the meat and how they use traditonal mustard in the sandwich. The combination just works well. Highly recommended and worth the wait in line. Grab a few pre-packaged meats so you can take some home and pack some sandwiches!"

Especially if I'm hangry. Not going to happen. As luck would have it, my friend and I decided to come here on a whim yesterday (a Monday) around 12:30-1pm. There was zero line-up and we got a table right away. I ordered my smoked meat lean and my friend who is pro-fat, went for the full-fat version. We ordered a side of fries to share and of course, a pickle. In terms of the smoked meat, wow was it ever dry. Now, I understand that I ordered mine lean and some dryness is to be expected, but I've had lean smoked meat before that was nowhere near as dry. It was also thicker than I'm used to but I'm OK with that. In terms of flavor, I really enjoyed it - but the dessert-dry feel didn't work for me. The fries were good - I'm not sure if they were home-made or not. That pickle was awesome. My friend enjoyed his plate - and he's from NYC where Katz's is famous for it's pastrami & co. so....Service: Great! Literally every staff member we dealt with was super nice and friendly. We talked meat, we talked mustard, and we talked tattoos and music. What's not to love, you? Nothin'. Price point: I'm not 100% since my buddy treated me but I think 2 plates + pickle + fries + 2 drinks came out to about $30.

He wanted to be sure I went and ""kvelled"" over a pastrami (smoked meat?) sandwich. While not an aficionado of most Jewish Deli despite my pedigree, I happily obliged him.I understand why so many feel the urge to compare Schwartz's to Katz's in Manhattan, however, there is really no need because they are very different is scope and nationality.  Where Katz's gives a broad menu of many J Deli's most famous hits, Schwartz's has a much more limited menu that focuses primarily on their meat sandwiches.  They both have a ton of ethnic atmosphere, and for the People, it feels great to connect with another part of the lost tribes.  Otherwise, the food itself is excellently prepared with an almost Biblical recipe, and is quite tasty.  Certainly worth a trip if you are in Montreal and enjoy fat sandwiches. Otherwise, most North American cities have at least one old Jewish Deli that can satisfy your craving for smoked beef on rye.  Schwartz's up in Montreal is on that short list of great pastrami houses (Maison de Pastrami). Sooner of later, someone will put together a Yelp List of great P'rami joints and this one will be in the top 3."

(There are other items, such as turkey, salami, and chicken, but we'll leave those for another visit).  The smoked meat comes in three degrees of fattiness. Sorry to have to shorten your lifespans, but stick to the medium and fatty.  Schwarz's sandwich is a simple presentation of bread with a swipe of mustard.  The lean would work on a more complex sandwich, but in this presentation it's flavorless.  I worried that the the fatty would arrive with chunks of free-standing fat, but it doesn't.  There is simply more of the flavor-bearing fat elixir in the meat pile.  Go for the fatty and don't look back.  Just walk an extra, oh, ten miles or so after you eat.  The pickles and cole slaw are outstanding, to the extent that this place would be in four or five star territory even if the meat was store-bought bologna.  The sour and dill pickles and the zesty, non-mayonnaisey slaw drew multiple ""best I've ever had"" comments from our dining party.  Vegetarians might want to stop here just for those two dishes, even if it might be a bit awkward explaining the order to the waiter."

Skip the long wait of the eat in line by ordering at the take out door instead (took less than 5 min) and check the small seating area in the back for space! The smoked meat sandwich was heavenly. I came here while visiting Montreal for the first time after a waiter in Toronto's recommendation. At first glance, the deli doesn't seem like much but it's these very places that are full of surprises. You can order meat by weight or order a sandwich (smoked meat, salami, or turkey). I hadn't asked the waiter what to order so I ended up going with my gut and ordered the smoked meat sandwich. Boy, was that one of the best decisions I've made. I love that the sandwich was no nonsense- a ton of meat with a dash of mustard on white bread. Four hours later and I'm still full from it. The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy. I'll definitely be craving this once I'm back in the States."

Smoked meat: 5 starsService & wait: 1 starDecor: 1 starBe prepared for long waits, sit in communal table with tight spaces, and little to minimal service.You can choose various fatness of your smoked meat ~ lean, medium, fatty.  I didn't know I could specify after I ordered, oh well, it's good enough with me. I was already satisified with my warm, tender meat served on a fresh rye bread with mustard ($6.65). Next time I'll definitely try the kill-me-fatty option! LOL.A nice surprise was the cherry coke. I'm never a fan of artificial cherry products, but since almost every table ordered this, so why not give it a try. Oh, It was AMAZING!!! It completely changed my perceptions of all cherry drinks tasted like cough syrup. It was addictive, and a perfect companion of the fatty smoked meat.Tips: - There is a minimum order of $1.50 per person.- Take out smoked meat (cold) is $1.00 cheaper per pound if you can heat it up yourself at home.- Go there before 12noon to avoid huge lineups!- Cash only."

/user_details?userid=PaE4PpZhlQIYaWLtulZ6BA,Laila A.,"New Haven, CT",4 star rating,"In August 2015, I spent a few days in Montreal and, naturally, went to Schwartz's for their famous smoked meat sandwich. On a rainy day around noon, we parked a few blocks away and rushed through puddles of water to a large sign above a small doorway. Although there was no wait (and available seating), we decided to order a sandwich to-go, so as to enjoy it in the car while watching the downpour. While our experience within the restaurant was brief, the service was friendly and efficient; our order was ready within minutes. Back in the car, we unwrapped the smoked meat delight and began our critique. Our sandwich was made without modifications - It was hearty, tender, and very good, although it was a bit too fatty for my taste. Traditionally, the sandwich is served on plain sliced bread, which is fine but it does not add to the overall sandwich. This is definitely a meal where the star is the meat, without competition from condiments, bread, or other features. For New Yorkers, Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich is relatively comparable to Katz. While I would rate the sandwich itself a 4/5, my overall rating was around a 4.5/5 because of the significance in local cuisine and culture. This smoked meat sandwich was my third favourite food item from Montreal (1. La Banquise, 2. Sesame bagels from Fairmount, 3. Schwartz). I would definitely advise Montreal visitors to stop by Schwartz for a taste of popular Montreal cuisine."

The draw here is the Montreal Smoked meat, which is so tender and moist. Between the four of us, we ordered two large smoked meat plates. One fatty, and one medium. It's good to get both if you have enough people so you can mix the fatty meat with some of the leaner cuts. With this order, they bring out two plates of smoked meat and a side of bread, so you can make your own sandwiches. I'd say for four people, two large plates is prob a little excessive. It's also nice to get a pickle or two on the side.They also have black cherry coke, which is a nice to wash all the meat down."

Warning- I am not a communal dining person.The two of us walked in around 1 pm. We heard great reviews about their smoked sandwich and decided to give it a try. We weren't super hungry, so we decided to share one sandwich, an order of fries and a cole slaw. When we walked in it was very tight and crowded for my liking. There was one couple ahead of us. We waited only a couple of minutes to be seated. We were seated with the couple ahead of us, all the way in the back of the restaurant. The couple we were seated with were foreigners and had no idea what sharing a table meant. The guy sat right next to his girl friend and me and my friend were just standing there trying to figure out how we should sit without making it awkward by sitting directly across from them. For all you non-Americans or non-Canadians, when you're at a restaurant like this, and you have to share a communal table, you have to SIT ACROSS FROM UR PARTNER NOT NEXT TO THEM. Thank God the waiter came over and corrected this for us. To be honest this kind of ruined my whole experience, i was really uncomfortable the rest of the time there. The guy really annoyed me. He had zero common sense, but whatever i digress. The sandwich was ok. Honestly, I've had better pastrami sandwiches in hole-in-the wall diners or delis in NYC. The fries were gross. The coleslaw was the only redeeming part of this whole lackluster experience.Service was quick and friendly.  CASH ONLY!Would I ever go here again if I'm ever in Montreal?

Sounds delightful, ha, not really, but oh does that sandwich make up for the pain of the experience.The smoked meat, which is similar to American corn beef or British salt beef, is delicious. My sandwich overflowed with meaty goodness. It was the perfect mix of fat and lean meat served on smallish pieces of rye bread and some mustard. The beef was so tender it easily fell apart and I wound up eating it with a fork! There are other Jewish ""inspired"" dishes on offer (it is unclear if this place is kosher, I assume it is not), but almost everyone went with the smoked meat.Swartz's serves some of the best deli sandwiches I've had and can easily match anything you'd find in a deli-mecca like NYC.

I'd rather use up calories on another half sandwich.  The fries were soggy (even when I snuck one out of the bag in the car on the way back to the hotel), were not salty at all, and they looked like they were fried in old oil.  I could have done without the fries."

The eatery is small with long tables occupying 6 diners each time. We shared a table with 2 joyous couples, making the atmosphere more delightful.The portion is good for one but we shared it out as there are simply too many places to eat for a tourist. The staff took our orders and he didn't sneer at us when we told him its sharing, the only time was when I told him I wanted a lean meat in my sandwich! He laughed and ask why Asian always wanted to eat something lean which he adamant says it will not taste good. He coaxed me into eating a medium-fat nature which he has succeeded. Indeed, u have to order either a lean or medium fat meat that are not too tough and drying out. I liked its smokey note and somewhat delicate but not entirely frail texture. The meat has a good balanced of smoked and natural meat flavour and less harsh in it's seasoning. The lightly toasted rye bread combines quite well, but I wish they could splatter more mustard sauce (seeds along) underneath my rye, anyway u can doubled it up since a bottle is made available on each table. HP sauce, tomato ketchup, salt and pepper is within reach if u need any of them. I had the cherry cott drink which some says are good. Sure enough, there wasn't traces of awful cough syrup hint in it though it says artificially flavored. But it's not an everyday occurrence, so why be bothered!

If I only were home and had some white rice and some kimchi with the meat? Damn. Mindblowing. Pass on the poutine. And the pickles were aiiiiite. But the sandwich doe. Really doe. Thank you, Schwartz gang."

/user_details?userid=6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ,Dave L.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Schwartz's Deli is a surprising Montreal institution, as the only thing that's obviously Canadian is their location at the heart of Saint-Laurent. Stepping inside here is like stepping into a timewarp: memorabilia cover the walls, vintage stools stand polished, and piles of meat stare right back at you, as if they're preparing you psychologically for what's to come. Yes, this is a tourist attraction, but it's a delicious one. The queue moves fast thanks to their cash-only communal seating friendly but no-nonsense customer service strategies.Try their signature smoked meat sandwich (medium cut) and throw in a huge ass dill pickle (hello ladies). The whole shebang is only about C$7! Their meat isn't the most moist - this isn't life-changing stuff - but you'll be in and out of there so fast you won't care."
/user_details?userid=7cu49_GM_SAt8YF-7fDc_g,Marvin M.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,This review is not about schwartz's in Montreal. Its about something they are passing off as the real Mccoy.So here goes.Each time I'm in Montreal I have to visit Schwartz's for a smoked meat sandwich.  There is no deli anywhere that can come close to the goodness of their smoked meat.  I alway take home a few pounds of smoked meat shrink wrapped.  It stays good until I arrive home in Toronto.  Today I was at Costco and was extremely happy to find costco selling Schwartz's in pouches in a 1 kg box.   Of course I purchased one and could not wait to try it.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I don't know who is supplying this product and passing it off as the original.  It was OK but definitely was not the original Schwartz's in Montreal.   This is the first and last time I will buy this poor knockoff. VERY DISAPPOINTED.

I recently took a detour of 2hours to Montreal during a road trip just to have their sandwich again. The taste was still there but compared to last time the price had gone up while the portion size had got smaller. I would still go back but probably would not go out of my way for it. Also their customer service could improve. The cashier wasn't happy with our 10% tip and asked for more.
/user_details?userid=t903_es-gp3abvdrIQutQA,Jeremy K.,"Stoughton, MA",5 star rating,"One cannot fully experience the city of Montreal without stepping foot at Schwartz's. Located on rue St. Laurent, a street adjacent to the ever popular Rue St. Catherine, this modest establishment has been in business for over 80 years, serving some of the finest smoked meat you can find around. Everyone recommended this place, from our hotel concierge to my local friends and even random passerbys. Everyone swore by it and warned us that despite the long lines we might face, the experience would be rewarded.So off we went - all seven of us. We waited in line for a while and finally stepped inside this place. It's tiny, really, especially considering how popular it is. We were welcomed in both French and English and were given menus; not that it mattered, we already knew what we wanted and barely glanced at them. We proceeded to order 7 smoked meat sandwiches, fries and black cherry soda, a local speciality drink. A meal fit for kings, and apparently to the tourists that we are.The sandwiches weren't as big as the deli ones you get in NYC but just as tasty. The meat was tender, flavorful and absolutely delicious from the first to the last bite. The mustard adds a nice kick to it as well.The service is prompt and efficient; they were hard to try and turn the tables and minimize the lines; the prices are nothing one should ever complain about, especially considering the quality but keep in mind that they are cash only. This is definitely a place that I look forward to returning to on my next adventures up in Montreal - it's modest, affordable and best of all, has been around, which adds a nice character and mood."

We took the smoked meat sandwich with fries. It wasn't that pleasant that when I ask what is in the sandwich, the waiter told me that only meat. However, it does have mustard (the cheapest kind) in it, so beware if you hate mustard (like I do). The meat has a ton of fat in it and doesn't really taste much anything. We split fries with my friend and the total per person was around 12-13$ - not worth the service and food. The menu is pretty small and their signature dish wasn't really anything special, my recommendation would be to try something else than the smoked meat. Overall: atmosphere is awesome, it really feels like an old school diner. However, a bit overpriced and not that good food."

It's the kind of place that makes you want to move all the way to Montreal just so you can be near it.We were recommended this place as the ""go-to"" for Montreal smoked meat samiches. I've never been partial to Montreal smoked beef but after eating here I believe it's because no one does it right.The place itself is a very narrow shop, very retro in an almost dingy way. The ceiling looks like it might sink in and collapse at any minute and you wonder if it's really all that safe to come in. We managed to snag a seat later in the night but boy was it packed and filled with people to the brim.When the sandwiches come out, it's so simple you kinda have to do a double take to assure yourself that's it. Two plain looking pieces of bread smothered with yellow mustard spread apart by a heaping mountain of meat. At this point I'm like ""why even give me bread?"" I pull out a piece of beef and munch and OH MY GOD I SWEAR I HEARD THE ANGELS SING. The tenderness mixed with the smokiness mixed with all that hallelujah seasoning. You want to bathe in it. I hate it when smoking places stinge me in on the smoky flavour but this place delivers it.The process is even more fantastic, and would explain the flavour. (Don't shoot me if I don't remember it to a tee.) The beef, I am told, is marinated for 13 days to age and let the flavors set, smoked for 10 hours (or something?), and steamed for 10 hours leading to the ungodly amount of tenderness, suppleness, and flavor.This is just one of those places that you have to eat at when you're in the city, for like every day, and every meal."

Meanwhile, we don't have the around the corner, long lines that Schwartz's has, possibly because the above locations are much larger. Even with the massive hype Schwartz's gets via TV, social media, etc, it's not overblown. The smoked meat (or corned beef as many of us call it) it that good. It belongs amongst the best in North America, almost as good as Katz in NYC and at par with Harold's in Jersey, Caplansky's in Toronto and way better than Dunn's. Coming to Schwartz's isn't normally a quick stop. There always seems to be a crowd here. Patience is a must and if you are big into delis it's worth the wait, even though sometimes it's well over an hour. Think of it as an adventure and enjoy it. You'll be telling your friends and family about this experience at some point. And, unless you have a party of four don't expect your own table. They'll slap you at the same table with two others and there's nothing you can do about it. Keep in mind, this place doesn't have a dynamic menu. They focus on what they do well, smoked meat. And, if you come expecting that you'll be wowed during each bite. The tender, lean, juicy meat is unforgetabble."

There were six of us, so we got 3 plates of smoked meat, with the bread, and sides of pickles and peppers. It was absolutely delicious all around. The atmosphere is great, it is a small place so it gets very packed with a line outside. I definitely reccomend this place to all you meat lovers. If you live in or will be visiting the Montreal area of Quebec in Canada, then you must stop at Shwartz, definitely worth it.. A huge reccomend. It is a very well known and famous place too. News articles and pictures with celebrities and other famous people who've come here all over the walls. Great food and great service, what's not to like?!! :)"

The meat was about 60% fat which to me is a mark of a lower quality deli. I know its not the style because the smoked meat I had at the Montreal style deli where i live had almost no fat.  Good deli's usually have minimal fat or a lean option.  I see from other reviews there is a lean option but I did not see it on the menu and was not asked about it.  My review still stands because it sounds like if it was not on the menu then the server should have offered it.    Therefore, while I'd say its an institution everyone should try once to formulate their own opinion, next time I'm in Montreal, i'll try one of the other delis."

We live in Atlanta, and finding a decent Jewish deli with a really good smoked meat sandwich is all but an impossibility. Sure, some restaurants try to imitate what Schwartz's serves up so easily, but to get the real deal, make this place a stop on your next trip to Montreal. But be warned. Schwartz's is not for the claustrophobic. They'll cram you in so close to complete strangers that you can smell their deodorant. (Or lack thereof.) The line is often long, but moves quickly, so even if you want to linger over your meal, the brusque staff will not allow it. Better to get that sandwich - along with a glorious garlicky pickle and a side of their delicious cole slaw - to go, and head to one of Montreal's beautiful parks where you can sit and enjoy your bounty in peace."

Walking down here in the cold, getting a smoked meat sandwich and fries with a Cott's...it takes me back.The dining area itself is very small and the lines can be intimidating, but the staff is very good at moving people in and out promptly. I've never had anything but the smoked meat, and I've never wanted to change my order. It's perfect the way that it is. Most astonishingly, for one of the premier tourist destinations in the city, the prices are astonishingly good. Montreal was an expensive city to eat out in, and Schwartz's is one of the cheapest places I can think of. $7 or $8 for a sandwich that big? It's an astonishing deal, and it's probably a factor in how the restaurant has retained the loyalty of the locals despite its international popularity.Lastly, the cafeteria seating is charming. It's so small you'll almost inevitably end up sitting with somebody, and that's nice. You chat with tourists and you chat with locals. Last time I was there, I ended up eating with a governor-general prize-winning researcher and author. It's a place that draws everybody"

Order a cherry coke with it, it's the best combination there is.Be aware that in spite of the Jewy name, Schwartz doesn't serve kosher smoked meat. I believe Reuben's deli does, but don't take my word for it.My only criticism about Schwartz's is the fact that it's the epitome of a cash cow. There is no decor or ambience whatsoever, the management doesn't care, and they aren't about to do anything about it. The place is constantly packed, there's a lineup in the middle of winter, it's actually a fairly unpleasant affair.That said, I honestly can't tell the difference between the smoked meat here and at Rueben's deli on st cath. I really appreciate Reuben's atmosphere, it's a very comfortable place to eat, and they offer the same food.When all is said and done, Schwartz is a famous, historic joint. You eat there because everyone has eaten there. Because you're a good goy that does what you're told.Well, my favorite smoked meat joint is Reuben's because they even make an effort to make their restaurant comfortable for their customers, so eat your heart out, Schwartz's, you phony non-kosher profiteers!"

We chose medium, which came with a slather of yellow mustard on one side. We also got coleslaw and fries. I wouldn't get the fries again because they were soggy and a but oily.

That's right before closing at 130am they were done at 120am the exact time we showed up and refused to serve us or even let us in the famous establishment. How ridiculous!?! Don't advertise that you will be open and have your employees close early! I have been to Shwartz's and other delis in Montreal and NYC many times and let me tell you first hand that Shwartz's is also the dirtiest. Often the floor appears to be dirty and the bathroom is always a complete mess you would be lucky if you found soap in the dispensers. Simply disgusting that now the same employees who close up early might not even be using proper sanitation. Don't get me wrong their sandwich still tops the list for best smoked meat. However, if you're looking for a real MTL style smoked meat sandwich with better service and cleanliness head over to Lester's and Mile End in NYC."

I wanted a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a soft drink, so I had to buy each item separately.

Juicy and never tough, just the right amount of fat speckled with beautiful cracked peppercorns... $6 is actually mighty reasonable for this sandwich, compact but mounded like a pyramid. This was definitely a tourist destination that DELIVERED. (not literally)*FYI: ""Smoked meat"" is simply Montrealers' term for pastrami, but there was nothing pastrami-like about it. It was corned beef through and through! Which is a good thing since I looooove corned beef and usually find pastrami just a bit too salty/dry. (Pastrami is corned beef that has been smoked.)Just a few notes on the touristyness: We waddled into the restaurant shortly past noon. Every single one of the tightly packed tables was full. A waiter was cycling through languages at his table: ""English? Francais? Espanol?"" We were told that to order to-go, you go to the shop next door. I couldn't wait to get out of there.The shop next door is MUCH quieter, AND it has seating! Why were people in the restaurant at all??? We got our food in under a minute, ate it in peace in the mostly-empty sunny windowed cafe space toward the back, and even had the leisure to gaze at their prepared food items - meat, slaw, souvenir-y items...When we left, there appeared to be a tour bus lineup outside the restaurant space's door. 30 people stomping in the cold. Why?? Is table service integral to the sandwich experience? Maybe I missed out? My stomach doesn't think so...I believe their card minimum is $10."

So we did. We split a smoked meat sandwich and a poutine. Drinks were limited to sodas and some other items. Food was indeed good, but not exceptional. I have had better smoked meat - and much more of it - in delis in other cities. Seating is whoever you can find it, with others at the table. It was packed, but we were seated quickly. The best part was probably our server, who had been there 10 years and had his own act worked out. Definitely worth a visit, but not all we expected."

Four of us came in not long after eating breakfast and treated this stop as a small snack before leaving town. Despite not being too hungry, we devoured every last bite, wishing we had been able to visit on empty stomachs. The sandwiches were SO good. This was a few months ago and I still haven't stopped dreaming about the tender, juicy, smoky brisket. The cole saw and pickles were also stellar, and our server was funny and friendly. I wish so badly that Montreal was closer so I could eat here weekly."

Ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich with medium fat and poutine for extra carbs. The meat to bread ratio is 4:1, which I don't mind. Furthermore the mustard is a nice touch to the sandwich, spicing it a little on top of their specialty meat seasoning. Which becomes a topic of interest with my friends whom are trying it for the first time as well.The meat comes in three options: lean, medium, and fat. As I've ordered medium, the amount of fat provided made the meats tenderness just right, juicy enough to not feel guilty and also tasty enough to feel enlightened.The poutine was mediocre that made this store a four star instead of a five. Would totally be recommend and remember to bring cash."

/user_details?userid=eL8VdX4tyDr5zHWSahbtuQ,Courtney N.,"Wakefield, MA",2 star rating,I hate to be negative but I was expecting a lot more after reading about Schwartz's. It's basically a packed diner (where you have to sit with others) that offers 1 type of smoked meat. You get a ton of meat but it's basic service and cash only. We waited in line and then were so underwhelmed with the menu. I was expecting there to be at least 3 or 4 types of smoked meat to choose from but it was just your standard brisket. My friend got the liver plate. The pickle was very good. They gave me a plate of bread and a plate stacked with meat and that was that which was interesting. I tried to tell them I didn't want the bread before they ever served it so that felt very wasteful to me. The liver plate was tiny. The fries were okay but we didn't even order them so were a bit meh about having to pay for them. The waiter was friendly enough but clearly in it for the bigger parties like the six that sat down next to us and were ordering a ton of food. It wasn't worth the hype at all and I didn't feel the meat was anything special. Not a place that I'd return to.
/user_details?userid=clyp9Ay89BEE1Cd2q4M_sA,Rao R.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"I have heard a lot before arriving to this restaurant. The established smoked meat sandwiches since 1928 were too hard to resist not visiting during my trip to Montreal. When me and my family arrived, we were greeted with a long lineup of people. After waiting several minutes and watching an unemployed guy beg for money, we got a table sharing with two friendly elderly people. Me and my family all ordered the smoked meat sandwich dressed with mustard and pickles on the side. After they arrived, we all started digging in. The smoked meat was amazing. However, more smoked flavor would have made the dish perfect. The pickles were a nice side and served well with the sandwich (ordered separately). The service was quick and fast but also helpful. Schwartz exceeded some of my expectations. The smoke meat was great but I was expecting more with the smoked flavor. Also, the check (or bill) was very expensive, costing $46 for four people. I recommend this for people trying smoked meat for the first time. I will definitely return to Schwartz's."

Service was great and fast. The smoked meat sandwich was nice and seasoned. They give you the option of fatty or lean meat, we opted for fatty meats. The meat pieces were nice and thick. The sandwich may appear small but it is a hefty portion that leaves you feeling full. We also ordered the cole slaw which was a vinegar based cole slaw and pretty tasty. They definitely know what they're doing here, highly recommended!"

My boyfriend and I each had our own smoked meat sandwich. Sharing is not caring in this instance, we both cleaned our plates. The sourdough bread and mustard really compliment the smoked meat, overall it was a great and hearty sandwich. Try their coffee. It was surprisingly pretty good."

While they are known for their smoked meat, their slapstick comedy should be an honorable mention. During my stay I was ribbed by the staff a few times (all in good fun of course) and saw they do the same to other patrons. They were good at their job and I am sure that they get asked 1000 times a day on what to order especially since everything is in French. They suggested a medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and a black cherry soda. I must say that I liked the smoked meat better than salt beef (sorry London). The best way to eat one of these is ""medium"" (with a bit of fat) and fresh cut. I did notice that towards the end of my meal the meat did dry out a bit; so I would hate to imagine what a 8hr old smoked mat sandwich would look and taste like.. eek...Like any city icon it gets quite crowded with both locals and tourists so my advice would be to go during off peak hours. I arrived at 10pm an had no problem getting a seat at the counter. If you come at any other time be prepared to wait.. Remember that it is worth the wait!

If you don't have old-school delis where you're from, then this may be a novel treat. (We have Izzy's where I'm from and I think it's way better.) The smoked meat referenced in the menu is corned beef. It had a nice flavor but was a bit more dry than I'd like. Fries are okay--what you would expect and complement the meat well. The show stopper for me was the large pickle--with it's subtly sweet but highly vinegary taste. Seems like the kind of place locals learn to love from early adult experiences (could see this as good hangover food), but if it's out of your planned itinerary, I suggest skipping."

I mean, I didn't even know what I was ordering, I just knew that's what everyone was there for so I decided that's what I was there for too. The staff was brusque, fast, and competent in their jobs in whatever language anyone spoke to them. Being a tourist it was a bit intimidating but by the time I reached the front of the line I had rehearsed my order enough times to avoid annoying the guy behind the counter.I also picked up a mustard, because when you have extra foreign money, you spend it, the end. It looks like just a normal, yellow mustard, but it makes my sandwiches kick back like nothing else. 5 stars for the mustard!We got 2 smoked meat sandwiches and a small bag of greasy fries. The fries were, as I said, greasy, and not salted enough, and we left the overcrowded counter to eat outside in the nice weather, leaving the ketchup bottles behind in the process. TL;DR the fries were not impressive.But I was not there for the fries. I was there for the sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches that apparently inspired a Canada-wide musical of Schwartz's, evidence of which we saw while waiting in line. We sat on a bench and when I unwrapped the sandwich I had to swallow immediately or I would have drooled. The smell was so tantalizing and meaty. I applied mustard and took an enormous bite. The flavors of the meat. The mustard. The flimsy bread failingly trying to hold back the greatness of the meat.  I ate it good and dirty. Messy and unapologetic. A blacklight would have shown my entire face covered with that sandwich. Except you wouldn't need a blacklight to see it. 10/10 would gorge here again."

Being from the states I never heard what a ""Schwartz"" sandwich was and probably would of kept walking past this place had I not noticed the never-ending line formed on the sidewalk. After gathering my bachelor party group together, we made our way in the formation for their full-service restaurant. Soon after an employee came out and shouted their ""to-go"" location was open for those who didn't want to wait to be seated so we jumped over and made our way in. The place was an assembly line with people wrapping throughout the 1200-1400 square foot space while the employees worked feverishly hoping to keep up with the high demand of their famous Schwartz sandwich. We waited in line for about 15 minutes and viola! Our sandwiches were ready and we were excited to see what they were all about. These sandwiches were what I would compare to a corn beef sandwich on marble-rye bread with mustard and they were heavenly! We all enjoyed them and wish we would of ordered two each instead of only one :(. If I ever go back to Montreal I'll definitely stop back by.  They also have a cherry Coke type drink that tied the flavors together quite nicely. Good work over there!"

If you traveling through Montreal it's a must but plan accordingly as you may have a long wait. If you're traveling through Brooklyn, check out Mile End.

The 4 people in front of me all ordered the smoked meat by the pound and a loaf of bread for take away and I was the poor schmuck who went with the actual sandwich.  However, being a solo diner looking to follow up this fatty meal with a slow hike up Mt Royal, I think I made the right choice.  However, if its a nice day don't be afraid to have a picnic.The smoked meat is what I expected, a nice greasy helping of corned beef with some mustard (kind of a cross between yellow and golden...I'm assuming it's proprietary mustard) on soggy bread.  My fat body told my brain that this was smaller than what I was used to, but my brain pointed out I don't need a tower of corned beef and when adjusted for FX, it is likely close to what you get in the states as a pricing point. At first I wasn't impressed.  I don't know, I guess I saw the HUGE line for the dining room and all the reviews and I just did not think it held water to the American delis.  However, by the second half of the sandwich the flavor started to hit my tongue.  It's moist and flavorful without being overwhelming.  The Cole slaw was tasty too.  Sweet, but not too creamy.Bottom line is that I left thinking i miss Attmans of Baltimore and Hymies of the Mainline.  However, this is a solid choice and I may make a stop to the dining room before my trip is over."

It is a small plate with a huge portion of greasy but amazingly tasty meat. I enjoyed myself but forced myself to finish my plate. That was the biggest mistake. Me and my friends got sick all day. To be honest I don't know if it was because of the cold, of eating too much meat or just just the too much fat. We also hd the french fries and 1 pickle. It was so so good but just too much for our stomach. We couldn't have diner the same night after 8hours of digestion. I would totally recommend this address to EVERYONE but please do not force yourself to finish you meat like we did . I know it s good and it s cheap but sometime we have to control what we eat for the sake of our body. Tomorrow i will try something else: the beaver tail (there is no salad in Montreal sorry)"

For me, there are not many things that get me more excited than talking about meat. To end my dry spell, I could think of no place better to write about than Schwartz's.On a recent trip to Montreal this spring, Schwartz's was the place that I made sure to stop by.  Founded in 1928, Schwartz's is a Montreal institution and is best known for their beloved smoked meat or viande fumee as the locals call it.  Whatever you call it, smoked meat is just plain delicious.  Unlike pastrami which has a distinct sweeter taste, smoked meat is brisket cured heavily with spices such as cracked peppercorns and coriander.  For me fat equals flavor, so I selected my smoked meat served medium which was the perfect combination of lean & fat cut from the middle of the brisket.  Served between 2 slices of rye bread slathered with mustard, this was the perfect late breakfast on a cold Montreal morning.  If you plan to visit Schwartz's, keep in mind that this is a small place & does get very crowded with both locals and tourists alike. Unless you plan on taking a taxi here, Schwartz's is also about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke Metro station.  Another interesting fact about Schwartz's is that they were recently purchased by a group that includes singer Celine Dion.  Being an old school eatery, I really do hope that they do not change anything as this is truly part of the Montreal experience and was one of the culinary highlights of my trip."

A pile of fatty, perfectly smoked meat with mustard between two modest slices of bread. The first bite is literally a life-changing experience. Literally. As in, ""taking words in their basic or most usual sense"". Your life will be different after your first bite.Others have complained about the fries, and/or coleslaw; reviewing them as separate entities/menu items. This is nonsense. All in Schwartz's revolves around the smoked meat, and under necessity must be contemplated in its context. They are the perfect companions to the glory of the smoked meat sandwich, especially the Cott's black cherry soda.The decor is relatively unchanged from the days of yore, a time before the omnipresent distractions of cell phones and other forms of invasive, food-experience-disrupting technologies.

So I dutifully queued up on a holiday afternoon and waited patiently for my turn to take a seat and tuck in. The thing to order is of course the smoked meat sandwich, but there is a choice to be made--are you pretending that this dish can be made healthy and get it ""lean"" or do you through caution to the wind and get the ""fatty""? Well, you can have the best of both worlds and get it ""medium fatty"", which is what I did (my table mates got it lean, and I felt very sorry for them, since it looked quite dry and unappetising). Since I was saving fat on the sandwich, I decided to go whole hog (is that OK to say at a Jewish restaurant?) and got French fries on the side.The sandwich was very good. Not excellent, but very good. The reason for the reduction in grade was the bread, which was completely uninteresting. If they had something more like a New York rye, with a bit of body to it, it would have been great, but alas, the bread was rather limp and uninspiring. Also, please note that the sandwich is not a NY-style monstrosity that you cannot imagine a person actually eating. The size is quite manageable, so you'll have room for those sides. Unfortunately the fries were a bit lacklustre, but that made me feel less wasteful for not finishing them. The pickle, however, was great, and the Cott's black cherry soda (*the* accompaniment of choice) was perfect. Go! Enjoy! You'll thank me for it!"

Well, damn deli is right- damn delicious! Thanks Nga, for being such a foodie genius!Upon seeing how crowded it was on our arrival, we decided to take our sandwiches to go and sit on a nearby bench. While prying open the wax paper used to wrap my sandwich, I nervously noticed a ton of meat (slathered with mustard) packed between two ordinary slices of bread, and wondered, how am I going to finish this sandwich monster especially since I know I'm not going to like it? I sneaked a peek at my friend and remembered what my well-mannered mom always told me: never ever, complain about food to your host/hostess and finish your plate. This wasn't a dinner I was invited to, I know, but hey, politeness is politeness so I took a big bite, and at that moment I was instantly reborn. I shamelessly used a plastic fork to continue eating the sandwich since I didn't want any pieces of meat to fall on the floor wasted.I will never think the same way about smoked meat again, and I'm thinking of visiting Katz's here in NYC to see how their meat stacks up against Schwartz's.

/user_details?userid=xj8JavlGJUShGO3ogjNowg,Christopher F.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"Now this is the definition of a  smoked meat/ pastrami sandwich. I have a tendency to be a harsh reviewer when it comes to these types of meats because I've sampled very good pastrami/ smoked meat in NYC. When I saw this place on television and heard from my friends about the place while researching in Montreal, I became excited to see what the hype was all about. Little education for novices--smoked meat is akin to the combination of pastrami and corned beef--having the rich fatty, peppered skin of pastrami, but the lean, tender texture of corned beef.Somebody call my momma-- I was NOT disappointed at all. I encountered a long line when I strolled up to the restaurant but was not deterred.This was the best food I had during my Montreal experience. The sandwich comes in three different options--lean, fatty, and medium (which is a combination of the two). I ordered a smoked meat sandwich, double fried french fries, and a 1/2 sour pickle. This was awesome and satisfied the smoked meat fix that I developed after hearing about this place--fatty and lean, one bite melting the fat in your mouth. The fries were amazing as was the pickle. Wash it all down with a cherry coke ladies and gentleman-- its the perfect compliment to this meal.I went back after and tries a lean sandwich for comparison and must say that the medium is definitely the way to go.Here's a good hint--if you want to avoid the long lines, then come an hour before closing time. You will be served immediately BUT risk not receiving a fresher piece of smoked meat.Good operation you guys have up there North at Schwartz's my friends. Keep it up! You live up to the hype and are comparable (and dare I say better?) than the NYC sandwich institutes of Carnegie Deli and Katz's Deli."

Wouldn't bother going unless you just want the photo op or  off the tourist destination box. Nothing special at all about the sandwiches here. The bread was forgettable, and the meat (got the medium fatty as recommended by the server) was overcooked, dried out, and pretty flavorless. There was also nowhere near enough mustard (on top of using French's, which is great on a hot dog but doesn't do much on a sandwich). There have been plenty of other mediocre places that have much better sandwiches.  While I had Canadian money on hand, what really irritated me was the way they tried to skirt around paying with a credit card. They have some garbage excuse that their credit card readers don't get good signal from international cards. Just say you take cash only, and be done with it.  No one's going to be unhappy. Fyi, for those of you happen to not have an ATM card and only have US dollars, they have a sign that says that they'll nickel and dime you an extra 10% charge. Waste your money and calories at some other tourist trap."

I saw this huge line and regular patrons raved about this place...So we waited. It took about 45 min. Singles and tables for 2 were easier to get. I got the staple meat sandwich apparently medium was the way to have it prepared a black cherry soda and fries (tangy slaw and sour pickles-no half sours here). It is an old school place now owned by Celine Dion and the vibe is NY deli. The meat is smoked somewhere between corned beef and pastrami...but smoked. It was ok kind of dry and heavily smoked. I've had much better meat in many other deli's and there is no comparison to Katz's which is in a league all its own.  Also the sandwich comes with mustard without even asking which is not a problem for me just an FYI for you. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to return and certainly not wait 45 minutes for a table again.

It's a sort of hole in the wall full of tourists that are heeding the advice that ""you must go here."" Andy wanted me to try it, as she lived in Montreal for many years. She did not say that I must try it. But we were close, and it's kind of a well-known establishment in Montreal. So we went in. The place is old school, for sure. The vibe is totally New York, which I like. People are piled in at tables and slamming down millions of calories of food in a very blue collar setting. Totally enjoy the vibe of the place. We were squeezed in where they could fit us. People watching was ok, though it's a small joint and reading the stuff on the walls was just as entertaining. We got a sandwich. For me, this is pastrami from a Jewish deli. I know, I know. Everyone is going to say that no, it's different. To me, it tasted more or less the same as a real good pastrami. It's good, it's tasty, gooey, fatty, succulent, etc etc. I am not a big enough red meat fan to say that you absolutely must go here. It was good, the sandwich was good, the experience was good. But I think the hype is a little bit much. I read some of the reviews here and think that some people are out of their minds. Well, I guess I know that some people are out of their minds based on much more than that. But you get the point. If you are from the NY area and have eaten pastrami & corned beef all your life, don't go here. You will wonder what the fuss is all about. If that does not describe you, then you should go for it. It will be a really good, reasonably priced, down-to-earth eating experience that you will enjoy for sure. Unless you're a vegetarian. Then go to Fairmount Bagels instead."

What kind of service was that?? He needs to go back to elementary school to learn very basic stuffs to be a human.By the way, food was not bad. just service was horrible.."

The meat was pretty dry and some of the cuts of meat were quite thick. Paired with dry rye bread, it wasn't exactly the greatest sandwich I've ever had. We also got some pickles which were quite flavourless. I really only learned of Schwartz's after watching the Montreal episode of Tony Bourdain's Layover. It was somewhat disappointing as we had high hopes for awesome sandwiches. We have also been to Katz's in New York and vastly prefer the sandwiches there.I'm not sure if the eat-in experience would have been better."

Finally inside and seated at the counter, pastrami's everywhere.I order the sandwich and get ready to sink my teeth into deliciousness. No such luck, below average pastrami and rye bread. The coleslaw was runny, and the meat really fatty. Guess I'm used to good smoked deli meats being from Los Angeles and eating at deli's most of my life. Immediately I'm disappointed but what the hell I'm in Montreal and it's beautiful outside. While I'm walking I see several other smoked meat restaurants and they all are empty.

Their rye tastes like if a glass of tap water asked a genie to turn it into bread, and the cole slaw just tastes like raw onion. Also, you'll wait in line for both takeout and dine in.

Came in late one night to try the famous blah blah blah and instead left with my friend insulted and feeling pressured into giving a big tip for (pretty slow) counter service!The smoked meat sandwich was bland. Just a big pile of bland and old meat, which had clearly been reheated and was now dry and stringy. The fries were, actually, pretty good. The cherry soda, also pretty good in combination with the other things. But in the end it was not worth it.The uncomfortable part started when we sat down and the guy behind the counter asked us where we were from. My friend is from Vietnam, and once the counter guy heard that he started going off on how ""I bet you're from south Vietnam"" and talking about how he knows the whole story, and basically recounting a poor History Channel summary of the Vietnam War from some documentary he watched. Thanks, but my friend already knows. Then he mentioned something about Asians taking jobs, and wouldn't stop talking about Vietnam until I completely changed the subject.While we were waiting for the check I hear one of the guys brag about how he just scammed the guy sitting next to us out of 10 dollars by saying he ""didn't have any change"" and then he pressured us into giving him a higher tip too. We just wanted to leave at that point.Yeah the fries were good but maybe go somewhere else where you can get a sandwich that tastes good as well, without the other sh*t."

/user_details?userid=smnGVbqhRuGZskr7OkkhbQ,Kyrstyn B.,"Attleboro, MA",4 star rating,"Been coming to Montreal since the late 90's and never had a smoked meat sandwich. Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us.Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border."

I use the apostrophes because it might not be the most comfy place to enjoy a meal, so just a little heads up for y'all. Try not to come in large groups because it does get very busy everyday around meal times and without doubt you'll be sharing tables with other clients. This is not a big problem for me, but its worth mentioning ;).Ordering there, you can chose your meat cut as lean, medium, or fatty. For a full-on greasy spoon experience, get the fatty... but for myself/and most ladies, it's a little too much to handle, so I'd recommend the medium. Prices rise every year because of the fame, so it does run on the pricier side for a sandwich.Pay by cashAll in all, one of my favorite spot for a quick meal in town, don't miss out of this!!"

My boyfriend is from out of town and loves coming here. We prefer to order our smoked meat a bit on the fatty side - it is much more flavourful this way, I strongly recommend it! Their pickles and their coleslaw are delicious too. The drag with this place is the long lines. Tourists: the inside is kind of run down and they sit you next to other strangers - you are better off at their take out store which is right next door! In their take out area, they have a few places that you can sit and eat. Otherwise, what we do is, we will take it to go, and sit across the street at the area where the city has designated a rest area with benches. There are also many nearby parks to enjoy your food and avoid the crazy lines.A downfall in my opinion is that the restaurant is Cash only, so irritating when you are forced to use the ATM."

There were about 40 seats and the table next to you is about a foot and a half away. I could tell the 2 15 year old girls next to me were not happy too happy to have a 220 pound mess eating next to them. Believe me, I wasn't happy either. I should have taken the metro.I ordered the lean smoked beef, it looks a lot like a corn beef sandwich that comes on Rye bread with a little bit of mustard. My wife got half a loaf of bread and was very happy. It was actually quite a lot of food for her. I would have liked a little more mustard, which I added about halfway through.The sandwich wasn't overwhelmingly large like Katz', it was actually lunch sandwich size, maybe a little large.Also, it was only 7 bucks. Perfect amount for what you got. Very fair. Plus they took American money. Happy time!I should have got the medium fat, because the lean as super lean, if I would come here more than once I would have lean, but  I would have liked  a little more flavor.Our waiter was awesome, got us in and out of there, refilled the water often.

The meat is tough, fairly dry and almost tasteless. Neither pastrami nor corned beef, just dry brisket lacking spice. We ordered the medium fat sandwich. The cole slaw is cabbage, vinegar and a little sugar and water. If you want good smoked meat sandwiches - go to Katz's in NY. 2nd Ave and 2nd St. Then you'll know what we're talking about. The people next to us ordered medium rare steaks, about 1/2 inch thick which were as dry as leather. They came with a piece of liver so overdone it would work fine to replace the sole of your shoe. We got stung by the fadreit ( crazy) exchange rate too by this bunch of goniffs ( theives). They might have been good years ago - but don't let them fool you.

We went at like 8:30pm and the lineup was out the door. Luckily we were seated within 10 minutes. The decor probably hasn't changed since it first opened and it was super packed with people and tables, get ready to be very close and friendly with your neighbours. There was no question as to what we would be ordering! After we placed out order, we were served our food very quickly. The smoked meat sandwich looked slightly daunting, overflowing with smoked meat out of the bread. But that first bite..... Yum!!! The smoked meat was delicious! It wasn't over salted, had just the right amount of lean and fatty combination and was likely smoked. The mustard just gives the sandwich the perfect amount of kick. Overall, you have to come here to have their smoked meat! There always seems to be a line up there but it is worth it!"

Everyone who knew about smoked meat advised me to go to Schwartz's. I did not know where it was located so I went on the hunt for this famous place. I asked around for directions and all of the Montreal people stated ""its just down that street make a left."" So after following these directions to Schwartz's, I finally arrived there 1 hour later. With that long and dreadful walk my appetite was at an all time high. Unfortunately I forgot that a couple of people mentioned that there is always a lineup. I would estimate that there were 23 people were in line. Being hungry and impatient we decided we would go into the other shop dedicated to takeout orders. Even going in there there was a line up of about a dozen people. So I decided in line that I would just go for the Medium Smoked Meat Sandwich, with a pickle, and a Cherry Cola. After all the wait I sat down with my sandwich and began endulging. The bread was a nice thin slice filled with a fat stack of tender smoked meat and mustard. Im not a big fan of mustard but in this sandwich it was perfect. It was 6-7 dollars for a decent size but excellent quality sandwich. I washed it down with the delicious cherry cola and was satisfied. I would have got another one if I didnt have to wait in line. I would definitely recommend this place if you come to Montreal. I would just suggest that you know where you are going before you go on a mile long walk. Overall a simple sandwich with an incredible taste."

But they don't, which is not to be underestimated.I'd suggest getting it for takeout (the door on the left)--the line is shorter, there are still a few tables in that part of the restaurant, and the service on the right side (where the lineups are), while fine, isn't anything special enough to be worth the extra wait."

I specifically told the waiter to bring me fatty meat, but the meat did not have that melt in your mouth tasty sensation. Don't get me wrong, the food was still good, but not the same as I had remembered. This difference may be attributed to the fact that my first Schwartz experience was in the morning when the meat was fresh, moist and straight out of the Big plastic coolers they store their meat in.  I'd still recommend Schwartz, but try to go in the morning at 10:30am when they start serving FRESH meat."

There is never a bad bite in a Schartz's smoked meat sandwich, and that should be enough to garner four stars right there.And, it is a sandwich - you can actually eat it with your hands. There's some more stars. This isn't the Carnegie Deli, selling you something eight inches high that you can't bite into, this is a real sandwich. Enjoy.Plus, they treat you right, with a simple deli professionalism that gets you fed quickly and gives you time to enjoy. The sides are perfect deli style, nothing's been re-imagined and fusioned and brought into the 21st century, this is the real thing, traditional, and perfect.Why bother if its ""just"" a perfect smoked meat sandwich? Well, if you like your brisket and you like your pastrami and you like your corned beef, you probably want this while you're in town, and there is none better.

When we got there, the line for sit-down service was easily 40-50 people deep, so we went to the take-out line instead. Still a long line that weaved up and down the length of the store, but in reality, we only waited 20-30 minutes?We got the medium fat smoked meat sandwich and it was perfect- not too fatty, not too dry. The mustard in the sandwich gives it the perfect balance. We also got an order of poutine (no meat). It was good, but definitely not as spectacular as the sandwiches. The cheese curds were super fresh and squeaky, but perhaps a little too heavy for just 2 people with a sandwich each. If you decide to get take-out, there's a little park 2 blocks away where we ate our food and it was perfect."

I was hoping for it to be a bit more moist, but there was a hint of dryness. The slaw and pickle were ok and had a unique flavor. The poutine was not worth ordering.

Sure enough they liked it so much we stopped over on the way home so my friend could order some takeout for the road.They have the mustard on the table, which is good because I felt like adding more. The medium is not too fatty, but it feels more juicy. And once in a while you get hit bit a bit of fat and it's like butter, yum.

When I heard about Schwartz's, I had to go and compare... and you know what, I was pleasantly surprised... It's really damn good!So at Kat's deli (my current NYC favorite)... the first thing you get is the pastrami on rye with mustard... at Schwartz's, you get the smoked meat on rye with mustard. We had the option of lean, medium, or fatty. To be on the safe side, we went with medium because the lean might be a bit dry... a decision I ended up regretting. Should have gone with fatty. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious. I just wish there was more fat on it... personal taste, not because there was something wrong with medium. The flavor of the smoked meat sandwich was not as salty as New York pastrami... a BIG plus for Schwartz's. And it's actually easily manageable. I have never EVER been able to eat a Kat's sandwich without it falling apart on me. Sure we get to pick at the pastrami after we're done, but the fact that its so salty... doesn't sit as well as a clean sandwich.The only downside is that Schwartz's is not in New York. Schwartz's wins. Hands down.PS: I HATE cole slaw... But I actually like Schwartz's cole slaw. It's just brined cabbage. No mayo."

The French fries were plentiful, but hey they were just fries how can anyone mess that up. The pickle, well it was just a deli pickle.  What I missed most was having a beer with my dry smoked meat sandwich. Would I come to Schwartz's again when I'm in Montreal - definitely not!

Yeah.The place was packed on 3 PM on a Friday afternoon, and luckily we were seated right away. As the waiter came around to take our order, my boyfriend was originally planning to order the pastrami sandwich, before the waiter suggested the smoked meat was the one to try. His exact words? ""After you try our smoked meat sandwich, you won't even want to eat pastrami ever again.""Was that true? Not exactly.....don't get me wrong, the smoked meat was bommmmb. It was so good, I finished the whole thing and that never happens to me and my small appetite. But some parts of the meat were dry, and I did have to force down a few gulps with water. But it's pretty damn impressive, considering they were able to render such juicy slices of meat just by smoking it. I would definitely recommend this place as a place to experience in Montreal, from its old-school atmosphere (complete with ample counter seating) to its variety of deli sandwiches and meat by the pound. This place takes American cash, which is always a plus, and you pay at the counter in front. Happy grubbing!"

Not too smokey where its painful to eat, but cooked and smoked to the perfect tenderness. The cool thing about this place was that you were able to choose what kind of smoked meat you wanted. Your given an option of smoked meat with no fat, smoked meat with a little fat, or smoked meat with a lot of fat. Obviously...for me...gotta go for the smoked meat with LOTS OF FAT! Yah I know its not healthy for you...but for me: ITS WHERE ALL THE GUUDNESS AND FLAVORS ARE! We also ordered a side of french fries and dill pickles. The fries tasted like fries and the dill pickles tasted a bit different, but in a guud way. One of the highlights of this restaurant...the server kept on talking about this ""cherry soda."" He talked about it so much that I had to order one. THIS CHERRY SODA WAS SOOO AMAZING! It literally was the best cherry soda that Ive ever had! If Guinness Book of World Record had a category for best cherry soda in a can...it has to be the one that this restaurant has! ITS A MUST GET! Goes great with the smoked meat! This soda was sooo guuud that I bought another one TO-GO after the meal!Anyways...service was fast and quick. The size of the restaurant was very small...so be ready to get cozy with some strangers.

As you may have noticed from the photos, the sandwiches are basically 90% meat and 10% bread. It takes skill and training to be able to eat the sandwich while keeping it intact. The meat is oh-so tender and, in the true Quebecois fashion, is grease through and through. The mustard also blends well with the grease. On any given day you'll see a mix of tourists and locals lining up in front of Schwartz's for a bite of the delicious meat.

The rye bread couldn't quite hold the large stack of meat that was stuffed in between the two slices, but the messiness is part of the experience.The restaurant has a very deli feel to it, as that's exactly what it is. It's not the type of food you sit down to eat, it's more of a wait in line, grab a sandwich and walk around the street type of deal. Overall the meat was delicious and worth the hype. It would be much better if there were more toppings offered to make it more complete."

Also my toes almost froze off waiting outside for about an hour.Decor/Ambiance 3.5/5- This place sure has true delicatessen feel to it. Big chunks of meat are visible from the outside. The inside sits a limited amount of people (hence the wait. Don't come on the weekend to dine in, or at least order out). It felt a bit cramped.Service- 5/5- Food came out super fast as soon as we sat and ordered. Despite how busy it was, the guys were efficient and eager to take second orders/ modifications.Food- 2/5- Being from New York, Katz has set the bar ridiculously high for smoked meat sandwiches. Schwartz doesn't come close. This is not to say that its smoked meat sandwich is bad; it is decent. But decent is simply that- just decent. Also the black cherry coke was average. It doesn't help that this place is so hyped up- my expectations were too high. Bottom line- may be worth a tourist visit in the middle of  a weekday."

To make it perfect, they need to add half sour pickles and real deli spicy brown mustard versus just yellow. That is the only thing in the way of 5 stars. Oh yes and this is cash only which is inconvenient and they need to get with that program. I can't imagine getting anything better outside of NYC."

I decided to get takeout instead because I didn't feel like waiting in line. I ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich and I was surprised at who small it was. Although I liked the hand carved meat, I found that it was a bit too lean for my liking. I was also surprised to see that there was no pickle included with the meal. I also wanted to order coleslaw, but the takeout menu didn't even include coleslaw, which was pretty disappointing. Overall, the small portion of passable smoked meat was not worth $9.50.

The pickle was sour and nasty, and there was so little bread to contain the meat that the sandwich fell apart and I had to finish it with a fork.

It was good, but not outstanding. I actually found the meat to be a bit on the dry side. Maybe it was because of my pre-conceived notion that it'd be juicier, much like a pastrami sandwich. Not the case in my experience, but I'll be sure to give them another visit when its warm enough to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour, which probably means mid July. *Beantowns Finest*"

/user_details?userid=BI43zsVnKZHtMI_4GBStng,Julie K.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I felt prepared for my pilgrimage to Schwartz's. I turned up around 11:30 and was amazed there wasn't a line. Inside was plenty busy, but there were a few tables still open and seating at the counter. I squeezed into a seat here, between two gentlemen, and stared in amazement at the mountains of smoked meat waiting to be sliced for sandwiches--we're talking kilos and kilos of beef encrusted in Schwartz's special spices.""Parlez-vous Anglais?"" I asked the gentleman on my left. ""Yes,"" was the reply in a suspiciously American accent. I then asked if the counter guy would come back to take my order, or if there was some arcane process that wasn't obvious. He said the guy would be back to take my order and we struck up a conversation. It turns out Tim was originally from Dallas, but had been living in Montreal for about 17 years. He was already halfway through his lunch of a medium-fat smoked meat sandwich and fries. He recommended I also order the medium-fat, as the lean is too dry and some don't like the full-fat version. I followed Tim's suggestion and ordered a med-fat.When it arrived, the sandwich was a little smaller than I'd anticipated. But then I had to remind myself I wasn't in the good ol' mega-sized U.S. of A. anymore--and it was too big for me to finish anyway. The smoked meat was piled thick between two slices of a white-type bread (not sourdough, and not rye) and garnished with a bit of plain yellow mustard. The meat tasted like corned beef but not as salty, and there was just a hint of smoke to it. Tim said that he's not really sure why it's called smoked meat, because it's primarily steamed. Regardless, it was good, but I think I would have preferred the full-fat cuts. I noticed that by the time I was nearing the end of my meal, the meat had cooled and had definitely become a bit dry.So, I'm glad I made it to this shrine to smoked meats, but I think once was enough to satisfy my curiosity. And my arteries thank me."

I heard a lot about this place from one of my cousins and he even asked my brother and I to bring him back some of the famous smoked meat since we decided to make a trip to Montreal. I am so glad we stopped in here because the food was amazing! When we first walked over here, there was a line that was out the door, but it went by rather quickly (and this was in the afternoon around 2 pm on a week day). The smoked sandwich (I prefer the lean over the regular and fatty versions) was just so meaty and the portion was incredibly generous and very flavorful (taste like pastrami to me, but better). The turkey sandwich here is pretty good too. And I love that pickle spear that comes w/ the meal. Oh and by the way, if you come early at 8 am, you won't be able to order hot meat until at least 10 am.We purchased about 2 pounds of meat for my cousin to bring back to Toronto, which was sealed in a vac packed bag and also decided to buy 2 pounds of meat to take back home with us to California too. We were able to get through customs (in a carry on luggage) no problem. We had a receipt to show that we purchased it from Schwartz' in case, but the guy at customs never asked and just let us through (but secretly he was probably trying to think up of a way to cease it from us so that he could eat it during his lunch break)."

When we finally scored some seats we both ordered the classic ""Smoked Meat"" sandwich.  After finishing our sandwiches we both said ""that was one the best sandwiches I ever had"".Fast forward to 2008.  I was in Vermont last month for a wedding and my husband and I decided to drive to Montreal for the day. I decided since we were in Montreal, I had to have a sandwich from Schwartz's.  We headed there for lunch and as expected the line was out the door.  We waited for about 25 minutes and were seated.  Right away one of the the waitstaff came over and asked for our orders. We quickly ordered the smoked meat sandwich and fries to share.  When you order you have a choice of lean, medium or fatty.  We both opted for medium.  I also ordered a black cherry soda to drink.  The sandwich was as I remembered...tender and filling.  And, the soda was a good accompaniment.I hope I can make it back to Montreal in another 5 years so I can have this sandwich again.BTW, I noticed that they are building a take out place next door.  Hopefully, that will probably help with the crowds."

Perhaps we'll be more adventerous next time and will opt for such a platter... to share, of course."
/user_details?userid=7OjUhdATOsekdIQSE6TS4A,Bryan G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"As a self employed, single, childless dude I have very few responsibilities. However, going to Montreal at least once a year exclusively to eat at Schwartz's and pick up a dozen dozen bagels is something I take very seriously. There are really only two things you'd want to get here and that isn't because the rest of the menu is poor, I'm sure it not, it's merely for the fact that the smoked meat is just that good. If you're a sandwich lover (and if you're not, we're just not going to get along, don't bother contacting me in any way) order the medium fat smoked meat sandwich with fries and a pickle. If that doesn't sound like enough food for you it is, but if you don't trust me go ahead and order the coleslaw as well. It's average. But don't worry, you won't need to eat more than a forkful of it anyway.The smoked meat sandwich however, is anything but average. We're talking about a mountain of thick cut, beautifully marbled brisket piled between rye bread and some appropriately plain yellow mustard. There's usually enough meat on each sandwich that you'll want to take a bit off and eat it with a fork and knife but even if you think you can open your mouth wide enough keep the fork as some of the meat is guaranteed to fall out. One bite and you'll realise what the 80 year old hype is all about. This is meat like no other. MUST be tasted.The fries are a nice compliment and the pickle is enormous and juicy as a mofo. Not crunchy like you'd expect but definitely one of the better pickles I've eaten (though I hear good things about the Moshies pickle just up the street). If you're on the Atkin's diet, I'd suggest the smoked meat plate which is literally a plate of the smoked meat. That's too decadent even for me. It's common for people to order a loaf of rye bread with this and just build there own sandwiches, in fact, the last time I was there I saw a dude polish off 3-4 handmade sandwiches in less time than it took me to get through my sandwich. Fat ass. One thing you can definitely expect is a wait. Located on St Laurent in the Plateau, you can expect a 10-40 minute wait. The lineup is certainly part of the Schwartz's experience and even though I hate waiting, I love the fact that they haven't caved and moved locations - there's something special about that spot. Once you get inside, expect to be rushed to a table, where you're likely to sit with strangers if you're a twosome. But don't worry about making awkward conversation, it's understandable that no one could talk with that much meat in their mouth.The servers are attentive but somewhat impatient. I feel as though part of that comes from the fact that if you're from out of town you should really just be ordering the smoked meat and if you're a local you already know to get the smoked meat. The other part? They're French. Ehyo!If you are from out of town do yourself a favour and spend the $50 on a brisket to go. It won't be the same, but it'll still be the best thing you eat that week. Wish I had some in my freezer right now. I guess it's time to go back."

The ever present line-up demonstrates its iconic status not just as a quebec cultural landmark but as a Canadian one as well. Whether you like it or not Schwartz's is a must try. It was a cold, wet, damp day and I stood in line for 20-30 minutes and I hate line-ups but I was in Montreal and I had too pay homage. We eventually got in and were seated at the counter. The place is old and rickety and resembles a tomb, more than a shrine. But that is part of the charm and legend of Schwartz. Service is non-existent, you feel more like an interloper than a guest. Its like going to your new in-laws who wanted you too be a rich, jewish doctor, not a brown guy who writes Yelp reviews as a hobby. But too be fair the gentleman behind the counter was smiley and considerate. My wife and I ordered 2 medium smoked meats, a poutine and 2 cherry cokes, the classic. The poutine was terrible, the fries were far from crisp and had an al dente texture, which may be good for pasta but not so much for deep fried potatoes. I found the smoked meat too dry for my tastes but you don't get too stay in business for 80 years unless a lot of others do. But the cherry cola, that was the bomb!As an aside if i do go back, ill ask for the fatty, not the medium next time. It might change the dryness of the meat. The plate looked like better value than the sandwich. Also i'd use the side entrance, located to the left of the main entrance and get take-out. No lines, no fuss, the same smoked meat to go, without the purgatory.Watch-out for the lady who owns the churasqueiria at the top of the block where the line usually starts. She does not like her entrance being blocked and will animatedly tell you so!"

We showed up on a Friday afternoon and were greeted with a short line outside. However, we only waited about 3 minutes because two seats opened up at the counter. I'm telling you, traveling in a duo is the way to go when it comes to popular eateries. This encounter was a three-way of simplicity: smoked meat sandwich, fries, and a black cherry soda. With a little extra sumpin' sumpin' in the form of a dill pickle that was large enough for two people to share. Oh holy hell. One the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I intended to save half, but once I dove in there was no way I was stopping. Somehow, in an alchemy of food magic, three simple ingredients - meat, rye bread, mustard - combined to achieve sandwich nirvana. The fries were crispy and delicious, with the perfect amount of salt. Then, there was the black cherry soda (Cott's Black Cherry Soda, to be precise), which put this meal over the top. It was unlike any carbonated beverage I've ever tasted. I couldn't find it in the grocery store near where we were staying, but managed to snag a few cans at the Montreal airport. Had I known that the customs process was over and liquids were OK, I would have bought out their entire supply. I still have a can in my fridge that I cannot bring myself to drink. If anyone from Montreal is reading this, be my Cott's supplier and we will be BFFs for Lyfe. Other black cherry flavored sodas just don't compare. And it's not even like I have a particular interest in black cherries, this stuff is just AMAZING. Back to Schwartz's. The counter staff was very friendly and efficient. It was an overall great experience. I probably would have gone back, but there's just so much good food to try in Montreal. The very next day I saw on the news that Celine Dion had been at Schwartz's just a little after our visit. So even if you don't believe me, TRUST CELINE. (Black Cherry Soda. Remember that.)"

Probably if you're in Montreal for the first time or if you want a quick bite to eat as a takeout. In retrospect we probably should have just gotten a take-out sandwich from The Establishment next door and walked around the area.

I heard there's usually a long line up for their sandwiches, but I think there were less people that day due to the rainy weather.  The servers in the restaurant were friendly and humorous.  The seating is a bit cramped, the décor is retro and you will most likely have to sit next to some strangers.  However, it's all worth it, the smoke meat sandwich was flavourful as expected, and the bread was very fresh.  It wouldn't be a place to go for a date, but it's fantastic for a quick bite when there's no line.  If you are visiting Montreal you should definitely make a stop here."

If you come early, like I did - there won't be any fries on the menu."
/user_details?userid=augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,Coy W.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,I'm a big sandwich fan and I can't tell you how much I love the smoked meat sandwich here.  If you're in Montreal you HAVE to stop into here and get a smoked meat sandwich.  Remember to get it medium as the lean one always seems dry.  The fries are nothing special (don't get me wrong they're not terrible!) but the pickles are pretty damn good and remember your cherry cola!Every time I've been there has been a wait to dine in but there is take out.  This is one of my favourite sandwich places in the world.
/user_details?userid=Wb5Gs_FpWDYjrhn0luPd3A,Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3 star rating,"On researching what/where to eat at in Montreal, the one constant place everyone told me to check out was Schwartz's so I knew that was going to be the first place I was going to grab some grub.We arrived around 1PM and there was a short line outside. We must have beat the rush because no more than 5 minutes had passed when someone came out asking the line for a party of 2. Luckily we were the first party of 2 and we were seated in the very back.The menu is simple and here's what was ordered:-small smoked meat ($5.90 CAD): I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich actually. I felt the meat was a bit dry and flavorless...except when you happened to get a bite of fat which then made the sandwich moist and flavorful. I think the meat is corned beef (?) so I guess the dryness is part of the meat property?-pickles ($1.90 CAD): an order consists of 2 and they were crunchy and a bit too salty for me...but definitely good-fries ($2.65 CAD): crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily. I might even have to say they're better than In-n-Out! Sufficient side dish amount.The place is known for two things: the smoked meat sandwich and their cherry soda (which actually, you can find in NYC). Make sure you get the sandwich with mustard and if you plan on ordering the large sandwich, be warned that you make your own sandwich (they give you slices of bread and meat and you can make about 3 small sandwiches).Schwartz's is good, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional or the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The price is nice though!P.S.: you can order your meat to be carved lean, fatty and some other in between option. If you don't mention anything, your sandwich cut defaults to lean."

We took my father there and saw it from his eyes... it is no longer the gem it used to be and we will miss it as it was when I first moved here....We did not have to wait for a table - the only blessing ... we made sure we went early enough to be before the evening rush... so it was busy but not crowded and there was no line. It would have been dreadful to wait for that meal...Our waiter was a liitle too chatty ... I prefer the old style where they were efficient and slightly rude... you got hot and good food... and we're left alone. he should have spent some time cleaning instead. Our table was sticky and we had to ask for it to be cleaned... we also noticed that the place in general could have been cleaner...and this coming from a man who had eaten in some of the dodgiest places in Asia. The meat in our sandwiches was dry and cold. We generally like medium... but not served cold... the fat was hard instead of buttery melt in your mouth gooey. The pickle was OK.  The fries were inedible. They had stopped being home cut for a while but they had always been hot at the very least... not so on this visit. We did not eat it... and tried to send it back. They did not offer to exchange it or correct it. We left with the cherry colas in our hands and a sinking feeling in our hearts.... and went to find somewhere else to eat.Would give it .5 star if we could for the cherry cola and pickle.Sad to say that we cannot ever recommend this once fabulous institution and will never step across its threshold again.

But the waiter described where and how smoke meat was made in their place. He even swear to me that i wouldn't be disappointed.. if i did he would offered me a free meal.

The next time I am just going to take the Metro and save myself the pain of parking.  I first visited there back in the 80's and have been back every time I visit Montreal. This is a meat lovers dream and I have yet to find a place like it in Massachusetts. Maybe that's a good thing..  The sandwiches are packed with their tender savory smoked meat and I generally don't mess around with the sides like the french fries. I can get those anywhere but the steak and smoked meat are just great.  You have to be ready to take you time and go through the menu and deal with the crowd because it's always busy. TIP: get the coleslaw and pickle with your sandwich...!

If you're smart about it you can get a seat and have your sandwich, pickle, and black cherry drink. Just go at off-peak hours. For example 11am. I was there 2 weeks ago and got a seat at 11am and never saw a line. I also like to go to the takeout counter after to grab an extra sandwich for the airport and usually grab a big vaccuum sealed chunk for my own sandwich party at home. Its about $100 for a 7lb hunk of happiness. That's right folks. Happiness has a price and it comes between two slices of rye with mustard."

There is always a lineup, no matter the time of day, or day of the week. The wait has not usually long in my experience.  I have been fortunate on several occasions of getting a seat even from the back of the line, simply because there was space available to accommodate my group of two.

/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"So, so good. Every time we visit Montreal without making time for Schwartz's a little part of me dies. This is simply the best place for smoked meat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Some people seem to get steak, but I have no idea how they manage to resist the sandwiches. There will be a line. Just wait in it - you won't regret it. If you're getting it take-out, though, just head next door rather than waiting to get in to the main restaurant because they have all of the same food and it will be much faster.There's nothing fancy about this place. If you're in a small group there's a pretty good chance you'll get sat at a table with people you don't know and there are no frills on the menu. It's crowded as heck, with the quintessential diner feel. But everyone is in a good mood because the food is so good and it's great fun to watch the guys behind the counter fooling around, yelling out orders and slinging out sandwiches. And that's what you should get, by the way. Medium (or maybe fattier, but medium's always been enough for me) smoked meat on rye, or a smoked meat platter with rye bread so that you can make multiple sandwiches. Be prepared to have a sandwich appear in front of you very quickly and for it to take a moment or two for you to figure out how to wrangle the huge pile of delicious meat for which two pieces of rye seem wholly inadequate to contain. Yes, you'll make a mess. Then you'll go fishing for all the little bits of meat you drop, lest they go to waste. I always order my sandwich with a dill pickle, even though I don't normally eat dill pickles. The acidity cuts the fat in the meat beautifully, plus there's just something about the smoked meat, rye, mustard and pickle combination. The boyfriend gets fries, which are only OK in my opinion. If you have enough room for fries it seems to me you've got enough room for extra smoked meat.So yes. It's good. It's worth the wait. Don't cheat yourself, just go."

So, you get there and yes, usually there is a line up, sometimes just to the front door, sometimes down the street, I have apparently been quite lucky, never seeing a line-up when I go..You step inside and notice how small and 'homey'? the place is... if you are three or less people you will most likely be sitting with other random bodies who are also embarking on this piece of Montreal tradition.Plastered all over the walls are newspaper clippings, reviews, photos and other miscellaneous memorabilia claiming the fame of Schwartz's.I usually order a smoked meat sandwich and a pickle on the side, because what goes with a smoked meat sandwich like PB&J other than a pickle!Unfortunately I find the bread to be quite dry and hard... so maybe I could recommend just ordering  a platter?I would say maybe 50% of the time the meat I get served is pretty good, and the other 50% it's on the old/dry side... maybe it just isn't busy and dries out? I couldn't say...But, the staff is always on point there, no matter how busy it is, you'll order in good time and get your food in even better time!It is definitely a place you must go to once in your life!

Every time my parents visit Montréal, we always have to go one time because they love their smoked meat sandwiches. In my opinion, it can be kind of hit or miss because of the way they break down the fat while cooking the meat, which I find can be somewhat gummy at times and not melt-in-your-mouth. You could always solve that problem by ordering a lean cut, which I normally wouldn't choose because I find fattier meat more flavorful, but that's usually when it comes to Chinese meat preparation rather than the Western style. Other than that, however, they season it really well, and for some reason I think their mustard is the best I've ever tasted (I could literally just buy bottles of them; please don't judge me). It's hard to go wrong with their items and their cherry coke overall, and honestly, I have to thank them for helping grow my coke bottle collection to its currently humble size of three."

The sandwiches are in right portions and the smoke meat goes really well with mustard. The meat is slightly fatter and juicer than pastrami. We also ordered a side of poutine and it was huge!

It is just so good and you can't beat that price. We got take-out the first time and ate it in the small seating area-- we got seats for the four of us, no problem, even during lunchtime. There was no way we were waiting in the freezing cold for a table to eat something like this. Although one of the nights we went late, around midnight, so we sat in the main restaurant because there was no line. Take-out closed by then anyway. I was a bit skeptical about the pickles, so we didn't get them. Instead we got two different slaws, one was a very interesting vinegar based style, the other was more mayo. Both were cool, but I think I prefer the mayo. And of course, each time we got the smoked meat sandwich. Rye bread and mustard!! Though I usually end up putting on more mustard on it. YUMMM. Fries on the side is great too. BUT AGAIN, the price!!! I realize it's not exactly the same thing, but I'm a die hard fan of Katz's or Harold's pastrami in NY/NJ. I am actually willing to spend 14 bucks on that pastrami, so you definitely can't say no to this smoked meat, which is effing delicious as well, but about half the price. We went 4 times in 3 days.

/user_details?userid=ctq7YkzC6Cs_mYG4zWkVTQ,Randy Z.,"Dallas, TX",3 star rating,"Two years ago I was in Montreal on business. When my local contact met me in the morning, he asked me whether I had ever had Montreal's famous 'smoked meat'. I told him that I saw it listed on the breakfast menu at the Hotel Ruby Foo where I was staying, but I asked him what it was. He didn't understand my question. So I asked whether 'smoked meat' was beef, pork, or what? He looked confused and admitted that he didn't know. Later a meeting finished early, so he said he was going to take me to Schwartz's for the best 'smoked meat' in the city. We parked and walked down the street to find a line out the door and down the sidewalk. It was lunchtime and this place was packed. Eventually we got inside and were hustled down a narrow aisle to a long communal dining table where we literally sat elbow-to-elbow with strangers. A brisk, no nonsense server took our order and rushed away. As I recall you could order your 'smoked meat' sandwich with varying degrees of fattiness. I think medium fat was recommended to me. Soon our meals were unceremoniously plunked down in front of us. A tall 'smoked meat' sandwich stacked high with meat and bright yellow mustard. Some decent French fries and a beverage in a can. One look at the meat told me it was pastrami. So the mystery meat turned out to be pastrami. It was very good pastrami but just pastrami after all. It was obviously a memorable meal because I'm writing about it years later, but something needs to be said about Schwartz's. This deli is probably over 100-years-old, but it didn't look to me like they have ever cleaned the place in all that time. The floors were filthy. There's something to be said for authenticity and historical places, but why don't the owners take enough pride in their shop to clean it? It doesn't seem like they want to provide a clean and comfortable place for their dining guests to enjoy their food. Instead they run a cramped, crowded, dirty place with people standing outside in all weather waiting to get in the door. They're obviously riding on their well-deserved reputation for food but their hospitality leaves a lot to be desired. Oh well, I can say I ate at the famous Schwartz's..."

This is no museum - the moist brisket is excellent and the price is very reasonable. You can't buy a knish at Katz's in New York for the price of a smoked meat at Schwartz's! Not quite to equate them - the pastrami at Katz's is superior to Schwartz's viande fumee and the portions are larger as well. But the enduring populism of Schwartz's prices is something that, just like the flavor of the brisket, makes the place special.

They tell you to grab the soda but hey if you're enjoying a delicious and well portioned sandwich (almost no bread all which is good in my opinion, who needs bread just meat!) you need nothing else but the delicious flavor of that meat. They also have a to go place, so when the wait is too long (which it often is) and the line is out of the door on a regular basis at both the To Go and To Stay part.

I was not disappointed.I only waited in the line up for about 10-15 minutes. The way they have arranged their seating meant that the waiting isn't necessary going to be long and it reminded me of a school's lunch room where long tables were lined up all the way to the back and you were squeezed into any available chair. Although not ideal, this layout got the job done of getting you in and fed a lot faster.The menu had several different items listed; like chicken/turkey sandwiches, steak, etc. but while I was there I didn't witness a single person consuming anything but the smoked meat sandwich this place was well known for.The sandwich was definitely mouth watering good and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.  I had also ordered a side of fries and a pickle which went great with the sandwich.  I left Schwartz with half a pound of their smoked meat spices combo and a chunk of meat from next door (take out section).  They accept plastic (debit/CCs) only in their take out section and only if you spend over $12, whereas it's only cash in the diner side.If anyone knows of a place that is remotely similar to Schwartz's in Toronto (GTA), I would love to know about it."

And I don't think it was because we came in after 8 pm. No matter the server's age, young or older, each and every one of them was very nice, chatty and welcoming. Everyone is bi-lingual, and doesn't make you feel inferior if you ""ne parles pas Francais"". I sacrificed my vegetarian preferences, and ordered the famous smoked meat, along with half and sour pickles, and a side order of French fries, to share. All came very quickly, and I promptly bit into the sizable half of the smoked meat sandwich (aka pastrami), which was served on the freshest rye bread with a droop of mustard. The bread made a better impression on me than the meat: the latter was quite bland, though soft and well cooked. I added more mustard - nope, still not there. I toped it with the English brown sauce - nope, there's just something missing: flavor, spices!  I politely finished my half, pressing harder on the half sour pickles and fries. When our very friendly server asked how we enjoyed the meal, my husband honestly told him that it was not as good as the last time he ate there, about two weeks prior.  Well, not two minutes went by when a plate of freshly cut pastrami appeared in front of us, with the server saying THIS was the cut we should have had. Of course we had to partake, and, boy oh boy oh boy, THAT was phenomenal!  Juicy, flavorful, tasty, melt-in-your-mouth delicious! We polished that off so quickly, he brought more - all at no extra charge, simply to ensure the customers were satisfied with the meal, the service and the experience. The total bill was very reasonable, and,of course, we left a generous tip for the excellent service. So, from the horse's (server's) mouth: if you are not happy with the sandwich you received, speak up and they will replace it, no questions asked. Just do so before you finish the meal, as not every server may be as generous as ours was."

The meat is stacked so high that you will have a hard enough time just biting into it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves deli meat and wants to eat at one of the most popular places in Montreal. Be willing to wait in line for a long time, not much you can do about this. Be willing to sit with people you don't know and ignore some of the late night drunks.If you order packaged meat, it is going to expensive but the quality and taste is worth it. It is cash only.One thing that a lot of people do not know is that Schwartz was recently purchased in 2010 by Céline Dion and her husband.   Some of the issues I have with Schwartz's is that when you go to pay, the cashier does not care if she wastes your time standing there and talking to other employees and customers. I have also had a few experiences when the night staff is extremely rude and unfriendly.If you love Schwartz, I would recommend you also try The Main and Snowdon Deli."

My family all had smoked meat sandwiches and loved it. However, the service was rough (probably because there are 35 people waiting to get in the door & they're trying to turnover tables ASAP) and the atmosphere was cramped.

Despite the fact that your $7.64 will only get you the sandwich with no sides (trust me, you aren't likely to need much after consuming this sandwich), there is a constant lineup outside this place at all hours of the day.For an extra charge you have the option of ordering your sandwich lean or medium, but I order mine straight up.  This is no place to quibble about fat."

After 15 minutes in line we realized that if you are taking sandwiches to go that you don't have to wait in the line outside. Just walk in and place your order. Soooo, after waiting for 15 minutes we figured we would wait for a table. While waiting for the table we smelled a terrible sewage/garbage smell coming from a alley area directly connected to Schwartz. This totally ruined our appetites but we still waited. After 25 minutes our party of 4 was seated. We ordered the 1lb smoked meat platter for about 15 bucks. It comes with meat and bread. The smoked meat has a good flavor to it. It is spiced differently than Katz Deli and I really don't believe you can compare the two. Schwartz smoked meat is different from pastrami. I will say that when I visit Montreal again I will probably skip Schwartz if there is a line.  It is good but not worth a 25 minute wait and I could find comparable or better meats here in NYC."

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The brisket is usually (and if you're a purist always) highlighted by a squirt of straight up yellow mustard. The subdued sting and jowl seizing bite of mustard contrasts the saltiness of the meat. The juiciness of the beef is pretty much consistent throughout each piece, and this is due to the brining, then the steaming of the meat. Some may argue that the retention of moisture is the attributed to phosphates used in the brining, however, Schwartz's boasts an all natural-non-chemical brining process. To be honest, they could marinade in a stew made of old gym socks, and I'll probably still glob some mustard on it and slap it on rye.It kind of goes without saying that Schwartz's roots run very deep in Montreal, being opened over 80 years, Schwartz's has had celebrities of all kinds pass through their doors as well as had a musical written about them. The old timers behind the counter are just that, ""old timers"", take-no-shit-you-better-know-what-you-want-to-eat-dont-ask-me-for-suggestions.

/user_details?userid=tQjwnZQRPcKilyv8KaUnow,Niusha S.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"The smoked meat sandwich was good- the bread is only mediocre and not the slightest bit toasted although I wish it was. The high pile of meat is the star. I found it a tad dry, but still delicious. It came with a smear of mustard- I added more. I like the simplicity; you don't need to cover things up in sauces and spices if the main ingredient has quality to show. But it wasn't perfect.Their fries were good, not over salted or greasy. I did really like their slaw- vinegary rather than mayo drenched, which perfectly cuts through the fattiness of the meat. I even piled some on into my sandwich.The rib steak here is even better- get the Schwartz's combo and you'll get a nice fatty and flavorful steak, smoked meat, and a little cut of a tasty sausage, with slaw, fries, and a pickle. They did cook the steaks a bit more than what was ordered, they aren't thick steaks however: medium came out as medium-well, and the medium-rare found its way to the table as medium, but still equally delicious, and I did try them both.Their liver is overcooked completely. The liver I do not recommend- dried out and far from how liver should be.There is a wait, a line that can extend outside and down the street, and the three of us shared a table with a party of two, but I think it's what makes the place. There's nothing pretentious about it- this place is a dirty little diner. Our waiter was delightful. When I asked for fries, a pickle, and slaw, he only put in the pickle. ""Share"", he told us, ""there's plenty of food"". The combos come with slaw and fries by default. He was right, although we did finish EVERYTHING! I'm a small girl which can be deceiving; he underestimated my appetite.I'm not saying you should drive to Montreal for Schwartz's, but all in all, if you're in Montreal, I recommend experiencing this place at least once."

Other signatures, apparently include the cherry soda, and the pickles. I was told by some Montreal folks that the 3 signature foods here are: poutine, bagels (distinct from the NYC variety), and smoked meat.

I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully, one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here, of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches, 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM), the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder, these guys are cash only, but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36, pricey I guess, but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it, perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way, it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat, and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great, if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store, you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good, but it was a cold cut, still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay-1 point for the meat being dry. I'm sure it was an isolated incident ! :) Can't wait to be back."

Phenomenal.  I heard Celine Dion bought the place from the original owners.  She better not mess up a good thing or so help me I will go Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" on her!  Except without the Krav Maga, because I'm never gonna learn that..."

We dropped by around 3PM, so it was surprising that the line up was still pretty long. We ordered the regular smoked meat and some soda drinks. The service for the take out counter was efficient and prompt. The sandwich was one big, meaty affair. Just looking at it, I was prepared to be blown away. The actual result wasn't as epic though. The meat was super tasty, and I can see why this place is famous. But the bread was a little dry and the meal was too salty for my taste buds. Even for a meat-loving dude, I thought that the sandwich had too much meat and not enough anything else. The sandwich's flavour was too one note.  Perhaps I just expected too much?I'm not super impressed, but I would recommend this place for tourists just to see what the buzz is all about."

He informed us the chicken sandwich was cold and asked if we would like mustard on our sandwiches.The sandwiches were small but PACKED with meat. The smoked meat was ok. It tasted just like corn beef. But the chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. It was flavorful - lean but tender. Skip the potato salad, it was very bland.Side note: there is no lock on their bathroom door. Do go in pairs so someone can watch the door for you."
/user_details?userid=Y3IXgNmqZRor4Pd5YdF_hg,Lauren J.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"First of all, everything is seen and tasted through my lens of NY deli experience.The place is small and popular, hence the long line. We came at 11pm on a friday night in whats probably the off tourist season so we had no wait. But the ambiance/experience of eating in was nothing special to me (me having had the Jewish deli experience already, that is). So I'd take-out before I'd wait more than 15 mins myself. Don't be afraid to sit at the counter, though, as you'll have attentive service there; clearly the most animated server was stationed at the counter when we were there (our service was dull and lifeless). Its silly not to get a smoked meat sandwich of course. I didn't know about the cut/leanness options and just got what they gave me. And it was great. I've been spoiled by Katz's pastrami. But Im sure this is the next best thing outside of NY delis. This is shreddier than pastrami, I should note. It really falls apart; so be prepared for that. And its a little less flavorful than NY pastrami; it doesnt have that dark, peppery crust as much. Despite what you see in the window. Still great. These are smaller and cheaper than NY's. Get your own; dont share it. A half sour completes the experience. Though this one had the light green color I like, it lacked salt. The cole slaw was more vinegary than Im used to, not mayo, and more finely shredded. It was good, if different.One thing I just could not get over. Not a Jewish-face staff member in the house! Couldnt get over it."

I'm super glad we got there at an odd-moment where we were seated right away.It seemed like the second we sat down, a giant line formed at the door that wrapped around the block. Apparently it's like this often.Service is really slow but I think that's because they make these sandwiches with lots of love. Or at least, lots of smoked meat, and I guess that's hard to cut or something.Either way, you sit communal and we were stuck next to a whiny couple who kept complaining that other people got their smoked meat even though they came in after the couple. They were whiny, but we were determined to stick through the inequitable service if we had to.We split a small smoked meat sandwich with medium fat (you get to tell them lean, medium or Roseanne Bar circa 1980 level of fatness).  I thought the fattiness was perfect but my girlfriend wishes we went lean.The rye bread is delcious, the cole slaw was tasty but overpriced and we ate every centimeter (I'm using metric cause we're in Canada) of the sandwich and then proceeded to lick our plates. The meat was delicious and super-seasoned, it's much dryer than the corned beef and pastrami I'd had in the states. I liked this but I understand others liking the moist stuff ""south of the border.""  (that sounded really gross).Anyway, I would definitely make Schwartz's a mut-do for myself whenever I'm in Montreal.

It's basically a cover up.It's not perfect but it's still a good quality product above some others.For the price, it's reasonable and down-to-earth considering the Tourist crowd.

Instead of having a clean design, they opted to plaster all the walls with newspaper clippings of all the times they were featured, and also coverage of celebrities visiting the place. On the one hand I acknowledge the history and reputation of this place, but on the other hand this display was just too loud and in-your-face.

We order a sandwich (not super fatty) and seriously inhaled it while repeating that we weren't hungry.  The manager came by to check on us and see how we were doing.  We struck up a conversation with him and he told us that Celine Dion just bought part of Schwartz.  (I guess those Vegas concerts aren't doing so well for her??)  He also told us about Bourdain's stopover there.  Since we were tourists, they also shared some great local places to eat during our stay in Montreal.  Overall, the service was great and the smoked meat was to die for!!"

But, we waited outside in the cold in line for about 45 minutes, so I think i should be forgiven :) The decor is what I imagine it looked like when it first opened 80 years ago, minus some of the newspaper clippings on the walls.Everyone at our table had a classic smoked meat sandwich - I ordered lean and found it a little dry, so I added a touch more mustard. Those who had medium said the meat was perfect. The spice combination used here is different from what you'd find at other smoked meat places around the city.  The meat is flavourful, tender, and falls apart. The fries were good.  The star of meal, you ask? A giant pickle! Quite possibly the best pickle I've ever had (and I consider myself a pickle connoisseur, even if nobody else does). I wanted to stop next door at the take out counter to bring some pickles home, but the take out counter was closed. So I'll be back - the pickle is worth waiting in line."

Thankfully, Schwartz's is not one of those. Despite being on the list of almost any person I spoke to about Montreal, Schwartz's amazingly lived up to its hype because of its smoked meat sandwich. That sandwich would easily be able to throw down with Katz's pastrami in terms of pure, smokey, beefy goodness with a little mustard. As I found out on wikipedia, montreal smoked meat is basically brisket, but it's different from pastrami in that more peppercorns and a lot less sugar are used. The craziest thing about this sandwich is that despite the overflowing, thick cuts of meat piled on your sandwich, it costs $6. six dollars?! Last time i checked, katz's pastrami sandwich was somewhere around $15. Even on a wet, snowy, December night, there was a line of about 10 people standing outside for their smoked meat fix. Now I understand why. Along with hockey, poutine, and vancouver dimsum, Canada should be damn proud of its montreal-style smoked meat."

/user_details?userid=Wjr2aO5ANEqVDGer3o8cbQ,David L.,"Coquitlam, Canada",4 star rating,"I had my first smoked meat experience in Brampton, Ontario. My colleague at the time said it was the best smoked meat in Ontario. I had no expectation since the only other thing I had that remotely resembled it was Arby's. When I had it, the meat was dry like the desert, and the mustard was over powering the flavour of the meat. So when Banana Girl wanted to try it at Schwartz, I was a little hesitant.As we were drenched in sweat while walking down the Saint Laurent Blvd during our holidays, we were looking left and right for this place. When we arrived, we immediately walked to a packed store filled with history. It looks like a very traditional meat shop. Employees were dressed in uniforms resembling the movie American Gangster. We sat down dumbfounded, and full of curiosity. We obviously knew we wanted smoked meat but didn't know if there was a selection. The nice waiter (who looked like he worked there for 40+ years) told us that the best was  1/2 and  1/2. (Lean and fat) When it came, it looked amazing.We didn't even attempt to use our utensils. We grabbed the sandwich and we were going for it. Smoked meat in general has a very strong flavor. I have done some homework on the technique of smoking, and understand that dehydration is a part of the process. I can't really explain why juices were coming down my hand. The mustard was a nice compliment to the sandwich itself. I just want to say, I will never have a Montreal Smoked Meat ever again, UNLESS I have the opportunity to visit Schwartz. I've been to the alpha, the mecca of this unique dish. I can`t imagine anything better. Since this is a very short interview, I might as well review the beverage we had. I had a coke to go with the sandwich, and as I opened the can and inserted a straw, I`ve noticed every other table ordered a cherry type of drink. I can`t leave without trying a can. Here we are kids, Cott Dark Cherry Soda. It taste like... Fruitips Black Currant candy. If you don`t know what that is, I can`t help you. The only place you can have this is at Schwartz and Montreal local grocery stores.Well, I am so glad I had an opportunity to visit Schwartz. NOTHING can replicate this place. It`s been around since 1928. Heck, there is even a musical based on it. If you are in Montreal and have any free time, this is one place you cannot miss."

The A1 steak sauce needs to be nearby, too.)I don't know if I would call this place 'the best restaurant in Canada' or 'the Katz's of Montreal', but it is terribly good smoked meat, in a style very different from New York delis (bagels and smoked meat - it's what sets New Yorkers and Montrealers apart). It's mouthwateringly delicious, served in a setting that requires that you get close to your neighbour (and I've had some great conversations as a result).The line appears daunting, but the guy manning the door knows what he's doing.

You can choose your meat to be lean, medium or fatty. We got medium and it was fantastic!! Fries were awesome too, personally I didn't like the cole slaw as much, it was too sour for me. If you are looking for quick, easy, good and cheap lunch, don't get side dishes coz they add up pretty quickly!

The price for three soft drinks, two smoked meat sandwiches, pickles and lousy service, terrible seats and disappointment was over $60.00 US dollars. CASH ONLY. Never going back to Schwartz's and thinking twice about any place Anthony Bourdain recommends because he is wrong about this place and should warn tourists about it, rather than drive them to it.

Seating is communal but there are seats at the counter. The menu is in French but the waiters speak English so don't worry about whipping out your pocket translator. i believe most people are there for one thing and one thing only which is their smoked meat. the smoked meat is similar in taste to corn beef. it's served on rye bread and with a touch of mustard. there's a good ratio of meat to bread. i was a bit worried there was going to be a huge tower of meat that i wasn't going to be able to finish. i also ordered a side of fries as it seemed like the thing to based on what other people were ordering. i feel a bit guilty but i sorta liked the fries more than the smoked meat. perhaps it was because good fries in the states is hard to come by or maybe smoked meat was not as good as i expected. i think it's fair to say it was a little of both. if you're a visitor like myself, i would recommend this place because it's cool to visit places that are rich in tradition."

Honestly what I think I enjoyed the most was the Cott black cherry soda that I ordered by mistake because I thought she said coke..After this review I will be searching to see if I can get some sent to me via amazon.

Very casual place with 1930's decor (pretty sure 90% of the interior has never been updated). For those of you who have been to Katz's in NY, very similar look and feel, just a lot smaller (also smells phenomenal, just as Katz's does).You order your food at the counter and then turn around and walk 10 steps to pay the cashier (very inefficient, but I am sure they wanted to keep the feature from back in the day). The guy who takes orders isn't very helpful (no suggestions when you ask him what's good; seemed sort of annoyed that tourists impeded on his local spot area), but I ended up playing it safe and ordering the smoked meat sandwich. While I was waiting for my food, I was a bit worried that the meat wouldn't live up to my expectations: as soon as I walked in, I thought to compare the place to Katz's, so when I saw the meat slicer (Katz's only hand cuts their meat bc its so tender that it would fall apart in the meat slicer), I started to doubt.No need! For a $7/$8 sandwich, I thought this was great value; not the largest pastrami I ever had, but the taste was great (meat, rye bread, a little bit of mustard). The thing may not be oozing with juice, but the meat is moist and flavorful just the same. Each bite was delicious, with a little bit of variety (whether you get the peppery skin or the moist, center pieces with a tad of mustard).Overall, great experience, and a place I would suggest people who visit Montreal to go."

Walked in and there was a short line, but the restaurant's seating area (which is minimal but still enough..  though you'll be stuffed like a sardine) was quite full.  They are very fast to service, and you pay and are out the door in a matter of less than 5 minutes (Wednesday around maybe 2pm?)  I asked for ""medium fat"", as that's what I'd been suggested to do.  I don't think they cared, and medium fat is probably the default.  Anyway, I unwrapped it at the airport a couple of hours later, and although the paper wrapping and bag were soaked with some grease, the sandwich itself was not greasy.  It wasn't glistening with oil.  The grease was just from the natural fats that are melted into the meat itself, and not dripping really - since it's a dry meat.  I think it was on a mild rye toast and slathered in mustard.  Yum!  The meat is sliced medium.. and perfect for just grabbing a chunk out of your sandwich and eating with your fingers.  Yes, us Californians have no shame.  I think it was around $7?  Great deal, lots of meat (and I mean like maybe 2"" of meat stuffed into the sandwich), and you won't feel too heavy afterward.  I like!"

The line ups had died down but the place was still in full swing taking care of the late nite crowd.  We were seated quickly and introduced to our waiter, who like the other waiters and staff here probably had 20 years of seniority .  They are no-nonsense waiters.  Order your food and don't ask for BBQ sauce.  You can definitely say there is old world charm here because it doesn't look like they have done any updating over  the years. But who cares, it only adds to the ambiance and actually gives the place more charm.The menu extends beyond the smoked meat but it looks like everybody orders the same thing, Why would you want anything else? Of course we each had the legendary smoked meat sandwich on rye, a plate of fries, pickles and a bottle of cream soda.  The meat is very moist.  When you bite into a piece that has more fat, you really enjoy the juiciness and flavor of the brining. The hand-sliced meat stacked on rye bread with a squirt of mustard is heaven for a carnivore like me."

Order turkey and get smoked meat. Basically you are given whatever the server is in the mood to give you. And the smoked meat is rather bland.

It looked Proper (um...Kosher), and it was ger-jammed with noshers. It's kind of community seating, and you'd think you were on the Lower East side of NYC, save for the French being spoken.I was hit with a stern disappointment as we were seated. They had 86'd the Half-Sour Pickled for the night. Ran Out!. DAMN! The remaining Dills were of fine quality.The big macher here is something called ""Smoked Meat"", which is basically what we know as ""Corned Beef"" here in the states. A little coarser in texture, but very tasty.Schwartz's is very famous for their French Fries (Frites) which look like fresh cut spuds-they have that brown on brown slightly soggy character. Not typical frites as you would get in a bistro, but closer to the fries you get in a lot of Chicago HotDog stands. For some, these are quintessential eating, alas not for me. I'm not a big French Fry fan, soggy or not.In the long run, it was a good Deli, not a great deli. The Carnegie, this isn't. If this place was in New york, it would be run-of-the mill.

/user_details?userid=_FBvjevwtHCkDM6qijaHIA,Jonathan W.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Normally, I wouldn't recommend eating at a Jewish Deli while touring the very French Montreal but this is a perfect place for a good and cheap lunch.  Located on St. Laurent street, there is plenty of parking on the street in and around the area.  It would be a long walk from the Old City but is very walkable from the North East area of the Mont Royal park.There is generally a line out the door but it goes quickly.  I took off a star from the review because there isn't much room once you get inside the door.  The wall on the left hand side is lined with tables so cramped that generally the back of your chair is resting on the back of the chair of the person eating behind you.  The waiters are quick, courteous, and very accommodating even if you have a small child in your party.As a New Yorker, I tend to compare any pastrami sandwich to that of our fabled Katz but I have to say that the hot pastrami sandwich with mustard was just as good, if not better than the one at Katz.  The only difference, a sandwich here will cost you $6 - $8 whereas the same sandwich in NYC will cost $16.  The pastrami is perfectly cooked, heaped onto rye bread, and melts in your mouth.  The hotdogs aren't bad either.For three sandwiches and fries, the bill was around $19.  You cannot beat that.  They only accept cash and you pay up in the front of the deli.  They do take American dollars but will give change in Canadian coin.  If you are low on cash there is an ATM in the back by the bathrooms but don't depend on it as my Visa card didn't work there."

/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",3 star rating,"Somewhat disappointing, but still good enough for lunch. This place is arguably the most popular, most crowded tourist-trap in all of Montreal. The lines are extremely long the minute lunch starts. They have both a restaurant and a takeout section, but I would definitely recommend the takeout which has a shorter line and a few tables in the back for a quick bite. The prices are somewhat inexpensive, but their meat variety is extremely limited. The takeout line only took about 10 minutes, compared to the 45 minute line at the restaurant. If you don't like smoked meat, then go elsewhere. They do have turkey and salami, but from reviews, they didn't compare to the smoked meat. Anyway, the food was made really quickly and we were able to snatch a seat in the back of the restaurant. The smoked meat sandwich was not large by any means, but with fries or a pickle, it is somewhat filling. The smoked meat itself was nothing special; it sort of tasted like pastrami and corned beef, but didn't have any oomph of uniqueness. There was no elevating flavors that separated this smoked meat from any other place around Montreal. Anyway, this place is nice to try if in the area for a while, but if here for only a few days, I would pass."

I got my sandwich in less than 30 seconds after I ordered it. I also appreciated how focused the deli is as you have only 3 types of sandwiches only. However, I won't crave for their decent but quite common fries.Money talk: 2 cokes, 2 sandwiches ($6 each) and 1 fries amounted to $21 not including tip. Hey Cramer, get the price right.

All was good in da hood.  Service was initially very good.  But it all went downhill when my friend finished his can of Coke.  We waited until our waiter came around, then he asked ""Sir, could I have another can of Coke please?""  The waiter replied no problem, right away... then 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10.  Then 15.  20 minutes, and the dude does not come back with my buddy's Coke.  We were pretty sure he forgot by then, so when he came around again, my friend asked him for the Coke again (not rudely, but very politely as before).Things started to go really sour from there... the guy started giving us the kind of screw face that only the old Eastern European dudes permanently carry around.  Then he muttered something in French, which we could kind of tell was an insult because the locals surrounding us started snickering.Another 5 minuets passes by until the Coke finally arrives... slammed on top of the table.  WTF?  Why so much attitude buddy?So by this time, we are pretty much done our meal.. we grab the can of Coke to go, and ask for the cheque.  Even though we waited 20 minutes for Coke, we receive this promptly.  The awesome part?  He followed by two finger taps on the table, with instructions to ""leave the tip here.""Hahahaha!!  I could not believe this guy!  I've seen some guys with big balls, but this guy has the biggest balls of all time!  You want me to leave you tip?  I have never in my life had anyone ask for tip before.. never mind by someone who gave us kiss my ass service.  So after having a chuckle at his face, I grabbed the cheque and paid the cashier.Then we hit the sidewalks and started walking to our cars... out of no where, we start hearing some angry French speaking dude yelling at us.  We turned around, and sure it enough it is Mr. Big Balls himself.  When he had caught up with us, he had a copy of the cheque in his hand, and was doing math to figure out how much we should tip him.My friend and look at each other and started bursting out laughing.  We turned around and kept on walking, while LOLing non-stop... and of course, we heard lots of follow up French cursing from the angry man.Hey if the owners are reading this... control your people.  Your establishment is legendary, no argument there.  But your staff have that soup Nazi attitude because of your popularity.  And how ironic is that?"

He explained the whole 'smoked meat' phenomenon, which sparked an entire cab ride of lewd jokes revolving around meat smoking. Ha - and the concierge was worried about classy.It was refreshing to see this family owned and operated, bare bones shop serving solid platefuls of meat, classic french fries and giant deli pickles. There was absolutely no way I could finish my sandwich (I swear there must have been a pound of meat on there) and I left with a big, full-belied grin on my face.Sitting at the counter is the only way to go, as the owner (manager?) chatted us up about our trip, explained the ordering process to us and was just genuinely glad to have us at his establishment.

However, the line moves quickly, and soon we find ourselves sitting at the counter ordering sandwiches as fast as we can because we only fed the parking meter for half an hour not knowing how this Schwartz's trip will turn out. To be different and also being genuinely afraid of the amount of meat between those itsy-bitsy slices of rye bread (oh yeah, the minute you walk in, you see everyone holding that giant meaty thing in their hand), I ordered a turkey sandwich. Not to be outdone by the smoked meat sandwich, there were about 30 slices of turkey on two little slices of bread that barely could hold the meat. I tried some of the smoked meat and it was really good! I can't even describe it, because it doesn't necessarily taste smokey, and the meat is not saucy like slow cooked beef, or dry and shreddy like pulled pork. It's tender and chewy at the same time, on the verge of falling apart but not mushy. I guess you will just have to come and try it yourself. It was a really fun thing to do on our trip."

I had a sandwich again on my way back to Toronto from Montreal and I was blown away all over again. It was almost as if it was the first time I ever ate it. I finished it and cursed myself that I didn't order another, or at least acquired a pound or two of smoked meat to return home with. I can't get over how good it is, I feel like I should be bending down on one knee and proposing my order. The meat is spiced and smoked perfectly. The bread is soft and chewy. The perfect amount of mustard is spread. The portion is solid for the price. With a sour pickle and black cherry soda, it could very well be in contention for my last meal. I do."

It's very narrow and there's not much room for a line-up inside.   On a cold day we're allowed to squeeze between the bustling waiters, the take-out customers and the customers eating at the counter.The entire restaurant smells of meat.  Everything is covered in a film of grease.  This is all part of Schwartz being Schwartz.  There's a certain authenticity to the place that I just love.  The wall is covered with newspaper clippings of their success.  The restaurant is very cozy.  You're pretty much sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, knee-to-knee at the small tables.  If your party is less than 6 you'll probably have to share a table with a friendly stranger or two.  The seats at the counter don't offer much room either, so if you prefer a bit more personal space, try to get there at an off-peak time.If possible, use the washroom before you arrive.  The washrooms at Schwartz are pretty scary.Service:Every time I've been to Schwartz, our waiter has been friendly, efficient, fully bilingual and can do math in his head pretty quickly.  I'm impressed with their speed and accuracy even at the busiest of times.  The staff can be a little rude to the hungry customers in line, but they seem to do their best to accommodate everyone.It's well worth the wait!"

Just full of rich, smoked flavor, perfect with some deli mustard and bread, and served in Montreal at Schwartz's since 1928. They must be doing something right!There are other things on the menu here, of course, but I would pass on any other meats. I also had a grilled steak, and it paled in comparison. The usual accoutrements are available, including fries and cole slaw. But be prepared. This place is quite small and most of the time, packed to the rafters. At usual meal times, getting in here can be a contact sport. But it is organized chaos. The guys in here have been directing traffic here for a while (one of the newest team members has been there 8 years), so they will eventually take care of you.And as a bonus to American visitors, they accept US$ (currently at par).Definitely one of the best treats you should afford yourself in Montreal!"

Even the waitstaff have the old deli hats.Let alone, the pastrami sandwich ($5.90) is fantastic. The pastrami is steamed and smoked enough so that the meat breaks down and falls apart in your mouth upon biting into it. The meat is thrown between two pieces of light rye bread  and a light coating of yellow mustard. However, for those mustard pastrami mustard fiends like myself, there are bottles available on each table allowing you to liberally slather on as much mustard to your liking. It is leaps and bounds above many people's expectations. Don't forget to add a dill pickle ($1.60) to add some much needed crunchy texture, and a Cott Cerise Noire ($1.80), a yummy cherry soda, to swallow it all down. If you're really hungry, a small plate of fresh homemade french fries ($2.65), crispy on the outside and potatoey on the inside.But Schwartz's has been a long-time contender to the famous Katz's Deli in New York City and I couldn't help but to compare the two (they even had a Maxim article comparing the two just above where I was sitting, see photo). This is not your classic Pastrami on Rye that you are accustomed to seeing in New York City. There are subtle differences: from the lighter and softer rye bread compared to the heavier and thicker version sold at Katz's and delis throughout America, simple and sub-standard yellow mustard is used as compared to the more savory deli/spicy brown mustard, to the pastrami, and the portions are smaller. The flavors in the pastrami are not as deep and smoky, holding a bit of the flavor from its corned beef brethren. But there is one thing that Schwartz's reigns supreme, the price!! For the price of a Pastrami Sandwich ($5.60), Cott Soft Drink ($1.80), Dill Pickle ($1.60), and French Fries ($2.65), it still blows the price of a $14.95 Pastrami Sandwich at Katz's Deli. Sometimes price can make all the difference in the taste of food and that just might do it for me.And another sidenote: Get there well BEFORE 12pm. Luckily we arrived at Schwartz's at 11:45 AM on New Year's Day when there were still a decent amount of tables empty. But as we ate, the place was fully packed, with strangers squished together and sharing tables. There was no seat unoccupied. By the time we left, there was a long line extending out the door and 2-3 storefronts down."

/user_details?userid=U5ihhqG7PI7kyE9Ob2uqog,Umami Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"""A Montreal tradition since 1928"" - Schwartz's deli is Canada's oldest and most famous deli. Founded by a Jewish immigrant from Romania, Schwartz's is famous for  its amazing smoked meat sandwiches. The meat could possibly be described as a cross between corned beef and pastrami, but really it's in a genre of its own. Comparisons are often made to NYC's Katz's Deli, and there seems to be a bit of a meat rivalry between the two, which makes the experience that much more interesting. Personally, I think Schwartz's wins for flavor and juiceness, but the debate rages on. Like Katz's deli, the atmosphere at Schwartz's is chaotic, loud and crowded. And like Katz's, you stand in line first to yell out the order for your food, then wait among the crowded tables to be served. You can choose among three cuts of meat - fat, medium, and lean. Take the plunge and go for the medium or the fat. You didn't come here to eat healthily anyhow. And go with the Montreal tradition and get a black cherry soda and pickle to accompany your sandwich. The perfect place for a great nosh at a Montreal institution. People make pilgrimages to this legendary deli from around the world - if you're in town, its worth it to experience at least once, at least if just to weigh in on the great Katz vs. Schwartz debate."

For me it was the fresh kosher pickle that really sealed the deal for me at this place.  It was perfectly crispy and sour and delicious.  If I hadn't been backpacking, there's no doubt that I would have purchase a jar for home."

/user_details?userid=zKDv6DXVdhty3XS0TNFlgw,Z P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"One of the many advantages of living in Montreal is access to the most amazing smoked meat, a trademark food of the city. The most famous place to get your smoked meat fix is, of course, Schwartz's on St. Laurent street. You can tell which one is Schwartz's by spotting the line of excited tourists lined up down the block for a chance to get a seat! The meat (I get mine full-fat, not lean) is juicy and smoky and greasy and tastes amazing with a massive pickle and yellow mustard. Everything you could want from a smoked meat. But personally, I will not wait 30 mins for it-- I usually go to the Schwartz's STORE which is right next door to the restaurant and order mine as take-away.My honest opinion: Schwartz's smoked meat is really delicious, but not that much more delicious than the smoked meat at le Main across the street! There is never a lineup at le Main, and although you won't get the novelty or feel of the real thing, the food is right on par."

Elementary and efficient service in a cramped deli is the ideal backdrop to the simple and natural symphony of flavor about to play on your tastebuds.My recommendation is to sit at the counter. I saw the guy who mans it until about 9.30-ish and he is hilarious. Skip the fries and the coleslaw, but go for the pickle and the smoked meat sandwich. Hungry? Have a large plate: they'll pack whatever you can't finish in one sitting.Believe me on that one, you won't have the guts to. The large plate is enormous. And compared to the small plate it's a bargain.My typical fare is smoked meat sandwich and a black cherry drink.

It's a rather famous, tiny delicatessen in downtown Montreal renowned for many things-- including being overrated. But when I ate there, I thought it was.. alright. It was the meal I had after my quasi-epic trek up and down Mont-Royal the woodsy way, thus I was prepared for some meat!The ambience of the restaurant is tiny, grubby, cramped.. yet I couldn't imagine it any other way-- and I do admire the owners' refusals to commercialize the restaurant into a chain. The grubby atmosphere was actually oddly inviting. It was raining heavily the day I went, but there was still a sizable line (plus, it was dinnertime on a Saturday evening), and the wait was about twenty minutes.I have to admit the wait IS worth it though. The meat was amazing, and nothing like I'd ever had before. The fries and bread were average, and I unfortunately didn't get the pickles.. but either way, the meat was.. indescribably good. I probably could have eaten it forever if I could. It's so hard to put into words that I won't even try-- one must experience it her/himself. It probably isn't the most amazing meat in the world, but it IS pretty good.The service, however, was questionable. Our waiter was courteous enough, but didn't have a very welcoming attitude, and one of my party got into a small argument with him about one of the fees-- though, nicely enough, he ended up not charging us the fee that we so contested. Still, the service was only okay.While I must admit that Schwartz's IS a bit overrated.. it is worth going to at least once if you're in Montreal.Food: 4.5/5Service: 3/5Ambience: 3.5/5"

Was in Montreal for a weekend recently and had to hit up this place and get my dose of medium smoked meat sandwich with pickles. Had to wait in line as usual but it was well worth it. Remember if you're planning to eat inside, have enough cash on you because that's all they accept. If you decide to get take out (you have to use the side door on the left if you decide to do that, which will save you from waiting in line for half an hour) then you can pay with cash / credit / debit. May I also suggest you get a sealed / packaged pack of meat on your way out after you're done eating because you're gonna crave more of this meat after a few hours. While the packaged meat is a bit thinner, and not AS good as the fresh stuff they serve at the restaurant, the meat is still pretty decent! They pack all packaged meat the same morning so you can be sure it is quite fresh and they last about a week in your fridge, but I assure you will eat them well before then.  Bon apetit"

So I walked all the way to the back of the store thinking to myself, how can people wait in a line this long for a freaking sandwhich? Throughout the course of my waiting I chatted with my friend, who was just as curious, and grumbled to myself that this must be overrated. I may have grumbled a little too openly as when we got closer to the front of the line the man who was slicing the meat said in his most Jewish/Brooklyn souding voice ever? ""Hey ladies, have you been here before?"" To which we answered no and that we were from Vancouver, and then just like something out of a New York TV show, he shouted down the line that ""hey we got some ladies over here all the way from Vancooovah"" and it was pretty much the most awesome part of my smoked-meat purchasing experience. He even made sure to shrink-wrap the meat we were taking back home to Vancouver. The sandwhich, well, it was pretty okay, I don't know if I would bother waiting in line that long again, but the pickkles.... well, that was worth waiting for!

We split the large plate  (medium), which was enormous, even for two large guys. The smoked meat sandwiches we saw people order all contained generous, evenly cut slices of meat. On the large plate those even slices were supplemented by a pantheon of smaller bits which have been caramelized by the roasting process until they are toothy and crispy.

I appreciated the portion size--generous but not crazy a la Carnegie Deli. So far, so good.  Not so good? The fries, which were greasy and not remotely crispy.As for the meat, well, Zabar's in NYC wins for me (their spicing is a little more complex and the meat is moister), and my husband maintains his loyalty to his favorite Cleveland smoked meat.  It's worth mentioning that what constitutes ""medium-fat"" is really the luck of the knife and which end of the meat your portion happens to come from.  My husband's sandwich had several pieces that were entirely fat, which felt a little excessive to both of us.  My sandwich was leaner, and in our opinion, tastier as a result. On the other hand, I do agree with others that ordering the sandwich ""lean"" would be a mistake--the meat is on the dry side already, and without a little fat along for the ride would lose much of its flavor. In short, Schwartz's for us was good but not great--definitely not up to the considerable hype.  If you've never encountered deli food before, it would be a fun experience, but for us, it just didn't hold up to the excellent deli sandwiches we've had elsewhere."

I read the reviews while I was standing on the long queue for seats in the restaurant side of the establishment. Some people said the meat was bland and tasteless, but after trying it myself I had to ask...where were they from and what do they usually eat?? The smoked meat was so tender and pretty flavorful, with just a bit of fat left on to make me swoon. I ate it plain without the bread or mustard and didn't feel it bland at all, maybe if you were comparing it to Southern American BBQ.However, as part of my Schwartz combo, I also had a steak with my smoked meat. I asked for rare and it was no where near it.  It was so overcooked and completely bland. It's probably why they sprinkle even more of their signature rub mixture on it before they served it to me, this piece of meat needs all the help it can get in the flavor department. The combo also came with an hot dog sausage, not too memorable.The sides were good though. The cole slaw was crisp and with just the right amount of vinegar, one of the best slaw I ever had. The large pickle was also just right. I devoured both.Stick to the smoked meat, ask for cole slaw, pickles, and peppers. Try to pair off when waiting in line.

Almost instantaneously, we received our sandwiches, which were stuffed with much more meat than the bread could support and topped with a bit of yellow mustard. The meat was tender and flavorful, Schwartz's secret blend of herbs and spices complementing the brisket's natural flavor without overwhelming it. The mustard added a subtle kick that kept the focus on the meat while also introducing a bit of diversity to this meal.

While I like the simplicity of the sandwich, I think that's also its one drawback.  I think I've been spoiled on the deli front with lots of flavorful and unique sandwiches, which had both high quality meets as wells as blends of condiments and vegies.  If you're in Montreal, definitely go here.  I know if I ever come back, Schwartz's will almost certainly be a destination to revisit."

Think ""Katz's Delicatessen"" if you've been to New York. The interesting thing is listening to the Jewish workers speak french. We went on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. No wait, not crowded - so what's the hype? My best friend and I ordered one smoked meat sandwich to share. I'm disappointed that you have to pay $1.50 for a pickle (from a jar!!!!) and $1.95 for some coleslaw. The sandwich costs $5.95 CAD or $5.36 USD and that's basically all you get. Two slices of bread and maybe a quarter pound of meat with some Heinz yellow mustard. The breakdown of each - the meat (Corned beef or pastrami I think) is really good. Tender with plenty of fat on the edges and you can see the cracked peppercorns. (Dieters be wary). The bread was pretty moist, not stale. We shared it and it was plenty enough for a share. The service is nothing to rave about at all, but seriously, you can tell right away as people just walk in and they're pretty much on their own. We ordered some meat to take home and the counter is pretty much no order, just get up there and cut people and order your meat at about $12.95 CAD / pound. That amount is worth it if you're not going to eat tons of it in one sitting. I took the cold cuts home and I'm eating about four slices a day and still have plenty left over. If I were to go back again, I'd pick up more meat at their take out counter but I'd avoid the sit down service. I did nab a bottle of Montreal steak spice for $4. Pricey, but hey, located on ""the Main"" everything will be pricey. You'll be amazed at how much Eastern European foodstuff you'll see on that street - Saint Laurent. My best suggestion, buy the meat - heat it up and pile it on Fairmont's ""all dressed"" bagel with a dash of dijon and deli mustard. That will do you good.  The meat will not come out the same - fluffy and moist, but still it has good flavor although a bit flat and dried at the ends upon reheat.As I finish this review, I will be stuffing my mouth with more smoked meat. Good for carnivores - bad for you vegetarians."

At Katz's, their specialty is pastrami, which is sweeter and sliced thinner.  They also serve it on rye bread with mustard, and it's also delicious, but it's totally different here at Schwartz's.  Katz's is the undeniable champion of the pastrami and the salami, but this smoked meat thing in Montreal is really special.  It wasn't until I came here that I realized ""Montreal steak seasoning"" that I have in my kitchen probably originated here.Here at Schwartz, the smoked meat is cut by hand into big chunks and slathered on the bread.  It's very juicy and fatty, and more smoky than sweet.  Their mustard and spices work as a perfect counterpoint to the flavors they have working in the meat.  They're subversive.  This sandwich may be perfect as it is.    The staff is also really cool and recommended that we complete the pilgrimige with fries, a pickle and a black cherry soda.  Do that.  The fries are awesome."

I've heard it said that Canada is America's attic ... you know it's up there but you're not sure what's in it. (If you just want to read about the Menu/Food ... scroll down.) That's how I felt. I did ZERO research on your beautiful Montreal. Fact is, I wasn't even sure if you drove on the same side of the road as I'm use to. So when I casually asked the rental car attendant where to grab lunch, and was told Schwartz's for smoke meat, I dismissed the idea as something like a Togo's or Quizno's. I'd never heard of smoked meat. It seemed to me logical to go where the guy I was talking to on my flight thought I would like ... Moishe's. ($$$$x10) I made my way to St-Lauarent Blvd or Bole St Laurent and saw Schwartz's right next door to Moishe's. The line and the cold temp, 2 degrees Celsius, I instinctively knew this place must be something special. BTW Americans, 2 Celsius is about 38 degrees ... I know, I was confused too. I made it in the door of this narrow and tight old old place. The group behind me were told to wait outside. No slack here for anyone. Someone actually wrote a play about this place. Given I was in the door I was going to relax and enjoy the experience as this is just one of those places you need to observe and blend into.Ten minutes after arriving I was seated at a table for four. Thought it odd as the place was too busy to leave three seats empty. WRONG. They brought four more and we all shared this small space. It was fun. My table mates spoke French beautifully but had no French accent when helping understand the Schwartz's tradition. My new friends were very tolerant of a provincial guy like me. THE FOOD. I memorized the menu ... its that limited. I had the smoked meat, I think its Canadian for pastrami, sandwich with mustard. (no need to tell them rye bread as that's all they have) and a pickle. Very good. You can order more flavorful (fattier cuts) smoked meat if you want but I took the standard fare. I also had a coke no ice. Not sold on that tradition yet. It was a delicious sandwich. The pickle was crisp and snappy. The mustard was obviously home made and the bread? Whats not to love? Jewish Rye. Fresh, moist, great crust. How can you ask for more? Good thing as you wont get it. I had a blast and was really glad I decided to try it. Thank you Budget Car Rental and my friends with whom I shared a table. My sincere apologies Montreal. Thank you for the intro to smoked meats and a great time."

He gave us other hints too, but too R-rated to share.Well, he couldn't stop telling us about this place being the best smoked meat house in the world. Yes he said the world. He was even stating how famous people go there all the time. The latter bit of information was irrelevant to me, but when someone is willing to say it is the best in the world, you have to put it to the test.The place is a small divey looking joint on St. Laurent street passed all the nightlife. There was a bit of a queue, with about a 20 minute wait. Once you get in you either sit in the 10 or show tables they have or sit at the counter next to where all the meat is cut. If I was alone or with just one other friend, we would have sat there, but there were four of us and we were going to do some gluttunous style damage (aka American overindulgence). The floors are greasy slipper, so they are covered with rubber mats to try to provide you some gripption as you walk. Don't let your clothes touch the ground lest they be drenched in smokey oils.We are big eaters, so we ordered a couple brisket plates, a entree of sausage and a entree of liver. The latter two were just okay, but when the plate of juicy sliced brisket came, we were in heaven. You actually get to choose between a lean, medium and fatty cut. I would have defaulted to fatty, but that might have been a heartattack waiting to happen, so we opted for a minor stroke instead and got the medium. It was super juicy. The seasoning fantastic. Slap a piece of rye bread in between two slices of brisket with a touch of mustard and you've got a true man's meal. It was definitely not for the calorie conscious nor those on low sodium diets. But if you have to go, why not with a plate of brisket. I was so in love with this place, I got a t-shirt to go to commemorate my visit. This place is awesome. I can't say it's the best in the world, but seeing my world of smoked meats is small universe, its got my vote for now...."

We both got the sandwich and a black cherry coke and the order came up fairly quick. The sandwich was overflowing with meat, just the way it should be! I didn't have it with the cherry coke at Katz and boy do I regret so because somehow they just go together like pb&j. Although I don't think the sandwich is exactly matched up to that of Katz's yet--there's just something lacking that I can't exactly pinpoint, could be that the meat was a bit drier or they didn't pre put the mustard in it (tip: douse your sandwich in mustard trust me!!), I don't know--but it is no doubt the next best thing and definitely worth a try."

It's probably a matter of taste, and it was delicious nonetheless, but if I return I will be sure to order the fat cut.The line for the main restaurant was extremely long.

Lucky that place was Schwartz's a staple of Montreal smoked meat since 1928!It is deli similar to katz's in NYC (smaller) except instead of pastrami they do smoked corn beef. Probably the best smoked beef I have ever had. The color of the meat is what food porn videos are made of. The meat is so tender so juicy it is hard to put into words!I will be back on every trip I make to Montreal!"

I refuse to listen to the people who say all Montreal smoked meat is the same, or that Rubens is better. I'm open to change, if it's for the better. In this case, once you go Schwartz, you never go back.I crave this place. When I fill this craving it satisfies the depths of my soul, not just my stomach. The perfect meal here is a medium sandwich, a side of fries, coleslaw, a pickle and a cherry coke. I hope you wrote that down. They opened a take-out store next door to help manage some of the traffic. The waiters at the dine-in restaurant are hilarious - they love to flirt, and provide a few laughs.

The line for takeout moves faster than you think, but the sandwich is much smaller than I thought it'd be, and much plainer, pretty bland besides the saltiness. Their fries looked amazing but we didn't have enough cash on us so we only ordered the smoked meat, having spotted the cash-only sign. Then we get up to pay and find out they take credit.. and the guy filling orders a few steps back wouldn't take 5 seconds to dump some fries in a paper bag for me, so I just huffed and puffed and bought fries across the street (bad idea, they weren't good)."

We were seated at the bar, tables of two get seated faster than larger tables because of layout. Our food came SUPER fast once we were there. The smoked meat was extremely tender. Best I've had. Not sure if it lived up to the hype, but it was definitely very good smoked meat.mmm"
/user_details?userid=PAIwBZoHKlGyCJ3KekCEcA,Josh S.,"Fairfax, VA",3 star rating,"My friends and i were on road-trip to Montreal from New York over the 4th of July 2010. I did most of planning for attractions and foods. I researched lots of different travel blogs and pages - they all seem to recommend this as must-try in Montreal. QC, so we decided to take online words.Inside is nothing special. Just an ordinary deli shop with small tables here and there. I remember reading that 'smoked' sandwich is the way to go and never EVER get the lean version. I decided to roll my dice and try the fat sandwich with fries.The foods quickly came and I was genuinely pleased with the size and taste of the sandwich. I now see why people come here and recommend this place for must-try in Montreal. However, I didn't think it was all that spectacular. In fact, there are many deli shops just like Schwartz in United States that offer very similar sandwiches if not match the taste. Schwartz may have the history and all the fame in Montreal but it's not the best sandwich I ever had in my lifespan. The service was adequate. Nothing great but not lazy either. We didn't ask for much, so the server didn't bother us many times. He already knew we were out of staters not knowing what we're eating, so probably just didn't care much for us.The price wasn't friendly either. I'm sure the management team hiked the price just for the fame part, but I didn't think it was worth the price we paid for. My meal, which was a sandwich, fries, and drinks were well over $10 CAD. I believe a place like this shouldn't go over $10 for a combo meal.Although my review may sound little harsh, I did enjoy the sandwich. We got there early for lunch. As we were walking out of restaurant, we noticed a line of 30 or some people outside -- thus explains the fame of this restaurant and Canadians must really love this place for lunch. The restaurant is located in heart of Montreal, St. Laurent Blvd so it's nice to walk around and grab a quick bite if you're not in hurry. Nonetheless, I do recommend this place if you're a visitor from out of country."
/user_details?userid=4iMzkb26_UFJeoV9qiPYhA,Lan N.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"Not bad. We had a large party so we got take out. The dudes helping us at the counter weren't very friendly. Kind of a cold shoulder feel. It was our first time, like probably many others, but didn't offer any expertise.I got the smoked meat sandwich and nothing else as some of my other buddies got frites and cole slaw. I stood outside and ate my sandwich. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't Langers or Katz pastrami. It is cheaper at like 7 dollars and they don't skimp on the meat. I just wasn't amazed. If you want it to taste better though... add cole slaw into the sandwich. It adds a lot of depth. The acidity and crunchy texture of the coleslaw complements the softness of the bread and saltiness of the smoked meat. I actually enjoyed my sandwich a lot more after the addition of cole slaw."

The line moves reasonably quickly, but I've never seen it without a line out the door (make sure that you don't get in the wrong line. one is for take-out and one is for sit-down).  It's good to know what you are going to order before you sit down. They move fast inside! Cash only!I'm vegetarian, but I will come here just for the decor, the ambiance, the chips and salade de chou. I usually hate cole slaw, but they have a very nice one here. Their chips taste very clean and fresh which is probably because they don't fry anything else in the oil. It is very different than a NY deli.I think it will be very nice when they open up the take-out annex with another smoker. I hope it works out for them!"
/user_details?userid=qX9rK32qy5hiYo9EPPJftw,Pourio L.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"Historic and famed location for your sandwich meats cravings in the centre of Montréal. And it's one hell of a place. There're are plenty of reviews (not just on Yelp) regarding this place and for for what I experienced, it was pretty damn good. Perfectly cured, prepared, cooked and dished out coupled with a can of cold soda, this place can turn a humid, blistering afternoon into one refreshing, stomach bursting adventure.Pretty much everything on the menu is good. I didn't get everything but I got a wide cross section of their offerings. Just eat the meat as the bread will just slow you down. I found the liver to be just ok so unless you're a huge fan of it, I'd suggest sticking to their famed meats and sandwiches. When in doubt, ask the waiter but be quick about your decision.Few things that I have to speak on that's not food related but will affect your visit here. First off, if you're driving here, you're going to have one hell of a time finding a parking spot. Be prepared to park a few blocks away and make sure it's ok. The markings are unclear and confusing at best and if parked in the wrong place, you'll get a ticket or worse yet, get towed. When in doubt, go into a store nearby and ask the worker there for some parking tips as they should be familiar with the area. Most people on the streets are either assholes who refuse to talk to you or just as clueless as you are. Second, the wait is long. And when I say long, it can go up to two hours. My cousin stood in line 45 mins before we arrived and we waited another 45 mins after we found parking and walked over to where he was standing in line. I do not suggest groups of more than 4. You will not find a table together unless you want to wait over 2 hours. Third, it's really crowded in here. You'll be sitting close to your neighbors so be prepared to be engaged in some friendly chatter with your seatmate. Lastly, order everything at once. Because it's so busy and super crowded, the waiters will be very difficult to flag down so when you sit down, look at the menu, agree on what you'd want and just order everything at once. Side note: it's be a plus if you spoke French and you'll get some bonus points for attempting it if you're a non-Québécois. Parking: Metered street and very limitedPrice: $15 per personWait: 45-1:30 just to get seated"

You may not have many options if you are a vegetarian or if you are a fussy eater that wants to make substitutions...that's the way it is.All you need to know about Schwartz's is that when you finally get a seat all you need to do is smile and say a simple ""Hello/Bonjour"" to the people seated around you, order the following "" A medium sandwich(we aren't talking size here by the way...medium is the fat content. Lean just doesn't have enough taste) with fries and a pickle and a cherry soda (you can Pepsi and Coke everywhere...here you drink Cott's)"", eat, pay, leave.  You'll do so having filled yourself with a great fortifying meal and having shared an experience that movie stars, politicians and rocks star past and present have done before you.In the spring of 2011 look for Schwartz's: The Musical from your friends at Bowser & Blue.  Dinner and show anybody?"

The takeout place has bar-style seating at the back, so in theory this is a decent option if you don't need a table or service.The takeout prices seem to be the same, and I won't complain about them because they're fairly reasonable (though the cherry soda seems a bit expensive).I ordered a fatty sandwich, fries, and a black-cherry soda. The fries aren't bad, and seem to be fairly typical Montreal fries: dark, fairly crispy, and quite short with lots of fragmentary bits.The real letdown was the sandwich. The flavour was there, but it was deeply compromised nevertheless. Unlike previous times I've been to the sit-down portion, the smoked meat wasn't actually sliced: instead, it was chopped up and combined in order to get the desired fat profile. Although I couldn't see the grill, there were obviously pieces/slices of meat laying on the grill, and when a customer ordered you could hear the cook chopping the meat together in order to get the right mix. This meant that some of the meat had been laying there for a while, and some of the individual pieces/fragments (which were pea-sized) were dry and almost seared. Fresh cut slices of smoked meat this was not. Disappointing.In contrast, if your order meat by the pound at the takeout counter you will get fresh-cut slices."

I would not recommend and it's definitely not worth lining up for.

The restaurant is small and you're seated at long tables, shoulder to shoulder with other diners. Old school style diner where you actually get to socialize with other human beings rather than being immersed in your phone. On to the food. The smoked meat sandwiches are out of this world. They offer lean, medium, and fatty meat. I suggest the fatty: it is the most flavourful. Sandwiches are overflowing with meat to the point where you need a fork to finish everything. The only condiment is mustard, and that's all you need. Also comes with a pickle. Depending on when you go, be prepared to wait in line. But the line does tend to move quickly and it is DEFINITELY worth it. Try to miss the lunch rush. We went at lunch time and waited about 15 minutes. But when we left there was no line at all. This is a must eat in Montreal. We were only in Montreal for two days and we had ate here twice. You won't be disappointed."

But, honestly, I would wait in line next time. Also, people said that Main Deli across the street is basically the same...no it isn't. When I left Main Deli, I felt that the smoked meat sandwich was somewhat bland. I did not have that feeling when I went to Schwartz's. The meat, mustard and bread were all quite favorable. The service was quick and friendly. And as far as my recommendation, go with what they recommend, because it is probably the best way to have it. Easily, one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal."

I've eaten countless smoked meat sandwiches over the years so I have an idea of what a good one should be like. The staff who took our order and served the greasy mess in a bag seemed to have no joie de servir  - I guess that's the burden of their legendary popularity - but the cashier lady did smile and thank us for our business which we liked.

/user_details?userid=o4W-L__qOkbvo9rAO2cqkA,Tom B.,"Belmont, MA",5 star rating,"Dear eight pound, six ounce, newborn baby Jesus, please bring me a smoked meat sandwich on rye with mustard from Schwartz's Deli, right now. Thank you.Seriously, this place does not muck about with their pastrami. When you approach a restaurant and they have a big bay window hugging the front door on both sides, and one of the bays has like twelve sheets of wax paper spread out in it, with two dozen crusty, smoked briskets of pastrami stacked on it like cord-wood, fogging up said window, you know you are about to enter a place where shit is going down. I went here for the first time a few summers ago, secure in the knowledge that the best pastrami sandwich could be had at one of handful of places known to me in my then home of New York city, and that the ultimate determining factor was just were you a Katz's guy, or a 2nd Ave Deli guy, or did you subscribe to something a bit more obscure in the outer boroughs. Schwartz's shattered that little fantasy world.I'll put it to you this way, go look up Plato's parable of the cave, and that will describe to you my experience of eating a Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich for the first time.So back to the story.  We got inside the door and were immediately whacked in the face by the aroma of briney, smokey, fatty bliss-ket of pastrami, and headed to a seat at the counter. There was no question that we needed smoked meat sandwiches (that's what they are called on the menu - possibly due to the francophone thing - not sure). Our counter service guy comes over and starts engaging us in french, which of course neither of us speaks, so we ask if he speaks english. ""sure thing. what'll you have folks?"" New York accent, and all. I'm not afraid to say that I kind of wanted to kiss this man on the mouth at this exact moment.So we got two smoked meat sandwiches on rye, with mustard, split an order of fries (NY deli style as well) and washed the whole thing down with cokes. I mean, really now, this was an outstanding goddamn meal, and the whole thing right down to the cokes coming in cans with glasses of ice on the side, to the brown mustard and the wax paper between the sandwich and the plate just oozed North Eastern US Jewish Deli. This sandwich is superior to any I have had in America (not just NY, but come on, NY leads the rest of the US in Jewish comfort food hands down, and I'm a die hard Red Sox fan admitting that). I love Katz's high stacked, house smoked pastrami on rye, and I love the sandwich that Yonah Schimmel made famous on 2nd Ave, but this thing is lean and fatty in all the right ways, and smokey and briney in such an uncanny balance that I dare say, regardless of their location, these folks have the pastrami sandwich against which all others should be judged.If you live in Montreal, or even just Quebec, you have no excuse for not eating here regularly (unless you're a vegan or something). If you are visiting Montreal, eat here at least twice, I'm serious, and then you may want to grab a sandwich to go for the ride back to the states or to BC. Any way you end up here, just make sure you end up here. You are missing out on something wonderful if you don't."

This was the second place we got smoked meat during our trip. Schwartz's got great marks. Less heavy on the brine/spices which allowed you to taste the actual meat. Bonus points for oil based cole slaw that was excellent. Be sure to grab a cherry soda and enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=0LpZKuNrMIMUCPyWGFDufQ,Steven Z.,"Elk Grove, CA",5 star rating,"Vacationing in Monetreal:I was wandering around my hotel looking for a place to eat for dinner and saw a huge line outside this place. I decided to stand in line to see what the commotion is all about. Initial reaction: This place reminds me of an old school restaurant you see in movies. This place has been around for nearly 80 years. The dining area is brightly lighted and pictures and newspaper clippings covered the wall. There's even a counter for solo eaters like me to eat. I ended up talking to a guy next to me and now we're friends. According to the staff they have hooked up two couples this month! Overall a very lively experience.What I ordered: The guy next to me recommended me to try their smoked meat sandwich and get the pickle. Normally, I am really critical of sandwiches because they all taste the same to me. Time to order to time served: Food came out quite quickly (should've take that long since it's only a sandwich right?) even with a packed house and people waiting for a table outside. Food: I can see why there's a huge line outside. The sandwich itself is packed with meat and it was delicious. The fact that I was hungry made the sandwich taste even better. As stated before, I'm not much of a sandwich person and this is good. Wash it down with a soda and some fries and it's a winning formula.  Bathroom: Didn't get to use it so I cannot comment. Customer Service: The customer service was very straight forward and aggressive but still in a friendly way. I did not feel unwelcomed or rushed even though I was a bit dazed with all that commotion when I first walked in.  Would I eat there again: Yes, I will eat there again even though I'm not a sandwich and to me that's a pretty big deal. This place is not that cheap. For a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, soda was about 13 dollars."

My friends raved about this place, and I can understand why from the food that we got. We got a smoked meat, extra fatty. It was very good, but I'm sure my heart attack is not too far behind. Anyways, my biggest gripe was when I walked in for a minute, and this might be my own perception, but the fat guy with glasses who worked there seemed like he was a total dick. He said thank you to my friends, but while he said it, he tapped the tip plate. I wasn't too sure what I had walked into, but I wanted to keep an open mind about the situation. The place looked like a regular small diner with a butcher located near the front. This same fat guy with glasses looked outside and snarled his face towards my direction when we left (mind you, we left a tip after his words and actions), but I'm not too sure if he did so for his disgust at us (because we're Americans?) or because it was raining heavily. From what my friends told me, my observations about this fat guy being a dick were correct, but they are not from my own experiences, so my perceived perception with a grain of salt. Sandwich is very tasty, though very greasy."

I had the medium smoked meat sandwhich as instructed, and it was good. I wish the bread were just a bit more rye and I wanted the mustard to be brown and not yellow, but that might be an Iowa thing. The brisket was pretty moist and peppery but certainly not the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The pickle was good, we bought a jar to bring home and those are even better, smaller and crisper. What I was surpised by was the flavor of the frankfurter that my daughter ordered! It was yummy and smoky on the grill. Overall, I wouldn't wait for this place for more than 5 minutes.

Basically, we were sitting shoulder to shoulder having lunch with total strangers, which was fine with us. However, some people may be uncomfortable with the seating arrangements. The food? It was good, but I've been to better Jewish delis. The service? Fast, frenzied but friendly. The attitude seemed to be: Eat it and beat it.

Don't get me wrong, it's fresh.  But I guess it's not seasoned because I've tasted much better elsewhere.  The bbq chicken was good however I was worried because it was precooked and reheated on the grill.  I was afraid it would be dry, but they did a decent job of keeping it moist.

It seemed like the take out area was the only place to get poutin. We hadn't tried it on our trip yet, and I thought it was probably a good spot to have it for the first time. The sandwiches were the perfect size. We originally only ordered one, but one wouldn't be enough to split for lunch. It was a very good sandwich, but it was not any different than good deli's in NYC. The poutin on the other hand was heavenly. The gravy was rich and tasted of beef, and the curds and fries were very fresh. I will definitely go here again, but mainly for the poutin. If you don't get to NYC frequently, then I will say you will definitely love it for the sandwich. Like I say, since I can have Katz's or Sarge's in NYC any time, it didn't seem much different.

If you can take it to go, the inside is not all that amazing anyway, so if it is warm out, plan to take your meal out doors, or take it home.  Also if you want to ensure some better service be a good tipper.

I mean, it is more of a feeding troth than a Jewish deli, per se. The sheer volume of meat that is consumed in this place on a daily basis is staggering. At one point, I saw a garbage bin sized food-grade container being carried by two large, struggling men from the kitchen to behind the counter, full of the famous smoked meat. I watched each cut, nearly 200 lbs. worth, be unloaded out by fork, and be given the final pinch test for tenderness. Some were segregated to an insulated container to continue softening, some were ready for temporary sequestration before slicing. The meat then goes to the workspace of a very fat man with a messed up eye, whose sole job is to slice the meat, which he did with a rhythmic panache, his jaw swaying agape in a chewing motion, almost davening with each cut. An older fellow then slowly makes the sandwiches with rye bread and mustard, his hands pressing them into the well-worn plates with a tender push, the meat fat still jiggling off the sides, mesmerizing the packed-in customers under its tender, pink, shiny spell.      The meat just doesn't stop at Schwartz's, all day or all night, and I can't help but mourn for the arteries of the obese and nostalgic clientele who frequent this place."

The sandwich is packed with their fatty delicious meat and a little mustard with rye bread. It's similar to a pastrami but the meat is thicker.

It comes with mustard on it and it's sandwiched between three slices of bread...that's how much meat they give you. That one sandwich is enough to completely fill a person up. Maybe that's why they sell the sandwich without any sides. I, however, always split a side of fries with my lunch mate. They're the perfect combination of crispy and soft, with just a little seasoning, but not too much. The employees in the take-out side move customers through the line quickly, too.

A bit disappointing. The meat was also fairly fatty for ""medium"". Overall it was good but didn't knock my socks off. Moist but not terribly flavorful. Perhaps unfairly (?), i'd been expecting a lot of flavor. The bread was pretty plain too. The sides (cole slaw, pickles) even more disappointing, bland and tasteless, although I realize this place is all about the smoked meat. I don't believe in comparing apples and oranges, but compared to say, 2nd Ave. Deli in NYC, it was a letdown. Guess I'm more of a pastrami and rye kind of guy...

/user_details?userid=LRI0mAoTfhWIhU1FBIJ0cQ,Christine L.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"I must admit, my memory is going to be a bit hazy. I entered Schwartz a bit drunk around 11 pm, brightly lit with fluorescent lights, my friend and I stumbling in just looking for some amazing smoked meat. Now, Schwartz was effectively pumped up to as much as it could be. My friend's parents ranted and raved, and they're foodies that are friends of the famous Normand Laprise. Christ, I expect the smoked meat to taste like it was carved by God himself. I sat down, at what could only be described as a Waffle House-esque bar, with a bunch of raucous Quebecois night shift workers behind the counter ready to carve me up some meat. I took one bite and... damn. I lost it. It's different from New York pastrami, it's not quite the same. It has a different flavor, not as much strong vinegar, with a distinct smokey flavor, rubbed in pepper and carefully loved until the meat is divine. There's nothing else to the sandwich: two slices of bread, a vegan's nightmare serving of meat, and some mustard. I ordered the sandwich, with (perhaps now I look at it) shamefully, a water and a pickle. Now, I love my dill pickles with my sandwiches, but nothing complimented the intricate flavors of a carefully smoked meat than this homemade dill pickles. If you are not a pickle person, stay away, but if you can appreciate a good deli pickle, get it. All in all, I'll describe it to you. The meat, tender and moist, melted and fell apart like Britney Spears when she shaved her head. It was as good as I imagined it to be. The sandwich itself was just so juicy and delicious I'm sitting in my dingy Atlanta apartment pondering if I have enough money to fly back. It's famous for a reason, tourists. It's not like the Hard Rock Café. You're not going to get that commercialized bullshit, this is real food. This is what you should go do if you're a serious foodie tourist. Avoid the familiar, stray away from the commercialized, step into this place and you'll understand what real traveling is about. The atmosphere was as unique, a collection of people Quebecois, Canadian and tourist alike, all seeking one thing; a damn fine sandwich. This place will deliver."

I do love me some Jewish deli... so when I found it, I was excited. I've never had ""smoked"" meat, so to me, it was like a kid eating a mystery meat sandwich. Because of all the warnings of ""long lines"" and what not.... with the quickness, I hopped on the subway and bus with my bf from our hotel, 20 mins away. Turns out there was the street fair madness on Laurent, so our bus took a detour, and we got off a couple stops too late (damn you google maps!). Anyways, after getting off the bus stop, I literally ran like the wind to try to beat the so-called crowd. Many blocks later I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.... it was SCHWARTZ'S... bright orange. I ran some more (with my trailing bf). I ran to.... no line. Haha.... well, that was before I knew there was two Schwartz's next to each other. So I suppose the sit down place might have a wait, but there was also a tent of outdoor seating, which looked pretty full but no one was in line waiting. So we went inside to order 1 lb of smoked meat, cole slaw, and a turkey sandwich. There was actually plenty of seating in the back.The anticipation... opened up the package to a mound of smoked meat. Poor cows. Toppled tons of pepper and mustard on it and voila... yummy. Meat overkill for sure, but couldn't waste the pound, each of us consuming half a pound of hefty meat. Thank god for no bread, or we wouldn't have been able to finish it! Mixed the coleslaw (vinegary) with the meat and made mini sandwiches sans bread. Saved the turkey sandwich for watching Phelps swim at the Olympic stadium.Overall great meat. You can't get that stuff in NYC, so it did me good. Thank you Schwartz!"

I was sitting there, dejected, swirling fries in ketchup, and wondering how piggish it would be to order a second one. ""Maybe I could ask for a half size..."" I thought to myself. It didn't help that my boyfriend had just told me that on his first visit to Montreal, he saw a group at the next table order what was basically just a mountain of meat and a stack of bread. How come we didn't do that?? This is not on the menu, so if that sounds like something you'd be into, be sure to ask!I went for the lean smoked meat, my boyfriend had the medium. I was undecided, especially since everyone on Yelp said recommendations from Schwartz staff dictate medium is best. Still, I'm more of a 'head-in-the-sand' carnivore. I'm happy to eat the juiciest of steaks, cooked to the raw-side of medium rare, as long as it's lean. As soon as I get a piece of fat or gristle to chew on, the true horror of what I'm eating sets in and I lose my appetite. So, for a theoretical vegetarian with the will power of a junkie in a meth lab, the lean was a perfect fit for me. Just juicy enough and the 'OMG -- adorable moo-moo cow!' factor was kept to a minimum. Bliss!Just as an FYI, my boyfriend tried my lean sandwich and deemed it 'much drier than the medium' so take from that what you will fatty meat lovers.This place is pretty damn cheap.

I was traveling alone so I was plucked from the line and given a seat at the counter. An older gentlemen was finishing off his Medium Smoked Meat sandwich and correctly pegged me for an out-of-towner. He very graciously offered his advice: they serve a lot of good food at Scwhartz's but there is only one meal to order: a medium smoked meat sandwich (as apposed to lean or fatty), an order of fries, a 1/2 sour pickle and a cherry cola. BAM! Incredible. On first inspection  the sammy appears huge. One doubts one's ability to take  it down. Fear not. The meat is so perfectly prepared that it just melts on the tongue. The taste, the smell, the sides, the salt of the meat and/or the pickle contrasting with the cherry cola. Wow. You won't have to eat much the rest of the day and have access to a steady supply of water. A lot of salt in that meal, you'll be thirsty. My dining companion/new friend and I savored every perfectly smoked, perfectly seasoned bite. A true culinary experience that I hope to have again some day."

Be sure to order the medium fat content on the meat, you've come to Schwatz's don't try to be sort of healthy. If you come with a group I recommend you order the smoked meat plate and a loaf of rye, that way you each get to make your own sandwich with just the amount of meat that each person wants.

I'd had dinner before walking into Schwartz's. I'd thought I would simply had a bite of taste. However, my bf and I finished the whole ""large"" plate of just smoked meat. The bread was not good. The meat was terrific. I would love to try its liver steak sometime. I saw it being grilled on fire and imagined how good it would taste. However, I did not like our waiter, who was not friendly and not talented at asking for tips. But the meat scored! I seldom loved pork but loved it done in Schwartz's. So I gave it 5 stars.By the way, pickles here were awesome too. You have to have pickles going with the smoked meat. Before leaving Montreal, we drove there and brought the meat on the road. Luckily, the American customs did allow it to pass the border."

Everything is ala carte,  no pickles on the table.  But the prices are very reasonable . We had a half sour and cole slaw, a sweet vinegar type which was excellent and good French fries, even though I am not a fan generally.

It's not the best deli I've ever been to, but it was much better than the other smoked meat I had in Montreal. Since this does seem to have a big tourist crowd, I suggest to fellow tourists that you just go to the take-out side and bring your sandwich a few block to the edge of Mont Royal Park.
