/user_details?userid=Q0XCZJXk_SkbAQMpmjyy4A,Liz V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"It was late Friday night and we were starving. First thing we did was order a Cesar Salad and some bread. Hungry or not, it was the best Cesar I ever tasted! Onto the main course, all of us ordered different dishes and each meal was delicious. True Homemade pasta and sauce and trust me, all were fantastic. I highly recommend this authentic Italian restaurant off Catherine St. in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=nkfDRFTezTWvQgCcL16H4Q,Lisa T.,"Woonsocket, RI",4 star rating,"I always feel the great vibe of a welcome when we walk in.  A very cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The menu of food and wine are extensive.  Quiet with calming music. A great way to wrap up the city with authentic Italian food and fabulous services.  Mauro is  superb! He can adjust a dish to your palate and has (most times) a better suggestion.  Top notch, affordable prices and pure satisfaction!  Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=ktUxDtUAtoc3fgCopW9LLw,Elizabeth L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Located on lower Crescent Street, you will find Trattoria to be homey, comfortable and friendly. It is an older restaurant, but that only makes it more fun. They make you feel like family. Each dish is great. They have a shrimp dish you must try and save room for desert.Their wine list is very nice and will not make you take out a second mortgage. You will love this place. The locals seem to and they are very friendly."
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",5 star rating,"Boy oh boy has this place maintained its luster over the years, the food, table and wine service is as top notch as you will find any where and the food, well you'll just have to go for yourself as words simply cannot adequately convey the delightful experience that awaits you at Trattoria Trestevere.   I started with the escargot in a heavenly sauce that was just plain awesome, followed by a piece of perfectly grilled Dore. Dore is a very delicate mild tasting fish but the flavor was enhanced by a subtle grilled smokey charred flavor served in a lemon butter wine sauce, simply out of this world delicious. The accompanying pasta with tomato sauce was as perfectly done as anyone could possibly expect or hope for in this life time anywhere. Dessert was a creme caramel, it too was excellent and an espresso short with a glass of Sambucca with three coffee beans, là vous allez la conclusion parfaite!  Do not miss this Montreal Italian food standout,  I trust you will be as mesmerized with your experience as I was and am with mine."
/user_details?userid=O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,Teena D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Gord and I had supper tonight at Trattoria Trestevere.Avelino brought us some appies ... the bruschetta was delicious.  He also brought us some warm rolls ... they were soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.Gord started with a Caesar's Salad and he said it was the best Caesar's Salad he's ever had.Gord ordered Spaghetti carbonara and said it was delicious.  He liked that the pasta was fresh and he said the sauce was good.  He'd get it again.I ordered Lasagna al forno and it too was delicious.  The pasta was fresh and it was a large portion.  Yum!After our meal, Avelino brought us a bowl of walnuts and nectarines.  Alas, we were too full to enjoy them.I mentioned that Gord's birthday was tomorrow and Avelino bought him a piece of cake.  I just had a couple bites and it was good ... it seemed to be soaked in booze and the icing was creamy.If you want traditional Italian food, you should check it out!"
/user_details?userid=mlBLWEqePbjk_8oUT1a6-A,Steve B.,"Wyckoff, NJ",5 star rating,"Same as always, been coming here for over 15 years on our annual trip to Montreal, stumbled across it on a sub-zero night years ago just to get out  of the cold.  Best, and luckiest move I've made in a long time.  Old school Italian decor and atmosphere, friendly prompt courteous service and the food is EXCELLENT!!!  My wife insists they have the  best Bolognese sauce she has ever eaten, would take transfusions of it if she were ever hospitalized.  I've had several dishes over the years, veal parm quite often, and all have met expectations and more.  Just enough to fill you but leave you wishing for more.  When we first found it I hoped it would be around for a long time, but wasn't sure because it never seemed crowded.  But based on the reviews here, many have discovered this gem.  Not to be missed in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=Pf2lMKHB8Gb5OUxVjMkRTw,Bronwyn A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Urgh! This is a frustrating review to write because I think that I made the fatal error of just ordering the wrong things. You know when you look around and you think, ""Wait a sec...all of their food looks really good...why does my food not look like that?""So I'm gonna give it another try, and will update if necessary.Here's the deal...we both ordered off the table d'hôte. And it really was not worth it, in my opinion, for the tiny salad and kind of average dessert that you spend about ten extra bucks for. (Also, you gotta gimme a heads up if all your desserts are soaked in alcohol. Homie don't play that.)I don't quite recall our choices, but I do recall that they were almost entirely composed of cheese, upon cheese, upon cheese. And not much else. I get it Italian food has cheese. But not that much. I will say, it was quality, not your random shredded pizza mozz. But it was just overwhelming. The service was great though. And I liked the ambiance pretty well."
/user_details?userid=Jfhi-GfyqSoS07glnLGqXg,Bob D.,"Frisco, TX",5 star rating,"A charming Italian restaurant just off Rue St Catherine.  We sat outside until the rain drove us in.  Not busy at all on a Saturday night, but Americans are always early enough to beat the crowds.  We both had the prix fixe, and each dish was excellent.  In particular, the caprese was as good as any I've had in Italy and maybe the best ever.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful with good suggestions.  The $$$ is about right and well worth it."
/user_details?userid=QicIxAtcNNCfUMadjt1P3g,David F.,"Clarendon Hills, IL",5 star rating,Outstanding local Italian joint. Sat outside and put ourselves in the hands of the waiter. Could not have been a better call or experience.
/user_details?userid=AzxTru69knHQsftQp8qkQQ,Sharon E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Classic old style Italian in a cozy intimate setting.  The outside is deceptive--you can almost overlook it with Hurleys pub next door. But once you descend the stairs you are cocooned in a intimate setting that is a throwback to another era. Unpretentious but excellent food served with attentive service.   Highly recommend their pasta and homemade spumoni...
/user_details?userid=BNSJ6dLbRsRB5yc-Zkn00w,Melanie S.,"Chatham Township, NJ",5 star rating,I am enjoying a pre fixe meal which I selected the escargot provencal - which was excellent - veal masala with mushrooms also delicious and a quarter liter of house red. The choices for the pre fixe are good. I am deciding on dessert after the main course.
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was genuinely disappointed by this restaurant because I saw the pretty good rating and felt tricked. The food was too salty and did not stand out at all! The meat they cooked was not that good, seasoning is too heavy. Overall I didn't enjoy my dining experience, period."
/user_details?userid=kkF31xZwHj2cN9pH0l5N7A,Megan A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,"Am giving this place four stars for making me feel like I stepped off a street in Rome and ducked into a cozy little cafe, plus all of their pasta is house made, a big plus for me. You can order house wine by the 1/4 or 1/2 liter. The house Italian Chardonnay pairs beautifully with the linguine and clams."
/user_details?userid=ClJzLcIFteOjxi_YKSo9Mw,Sylvia E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here four or five times before and I am always happy with my meal! Tonight I had the Homemade ravioli and it was amazing, probably the best dish I've had here. If you like rosé sauce you would love this dish! Also the coffee is delicious, a perfect way to end a meal in an intimate setting. And don't forget to have the Spumoni for dessert which is homemade!"
/user_details?userid=KgmYVwUeMdHsrlVFRIIfIg,Victor A.,"Charleston, SC",3 star rating,"Ravioli was machine pressed. Rosé sauce was velvety. But the bruschetta was below average, tiny bites. Great refuge from the cold long lines of St Patrick's Day."
/user_details?userid=lKT8wI7T5CZyJKbK6gLmFw,Edward J.,"Portland, OR",4 star rating,"We found this place on Yelp. It is ""old school."" The look, the menu and the staff all appear to be from another age. Nothing trendy about it. Serious, heavy Italian food. But good. We shared a caprese salad which was outstanding. Then a risotto with seafood (perhaps too much squid) and cannoloni. We would do it again."
/user_details?userid=yptyNQaTYXhLWW1WkByJcQ,Rey N.,"Williston, VT",5 star rating,"Amazing food and great service. Beautiful atmosphere and kind of reminds you of Italy. Authentic, delicious food. We popped in after a long day of sightseeing and they took great care of us. Highly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=dPRPuYE1OYrfxEtqfFqFvA,Demo K.,"Astoria, NY",2 star rating,Not sure why this restaurant got so many good stars. Our service was normal and the food was not that great. I personally would not come back here the final kicker is when we got the bill and notice how outrageously priced it was. Thanks for nothing
/user_details?userid=OcHZFQ2LB-YOC9km78ZBQA,Lindsay F.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Tortellini Gigi was amazing and one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It is packed with rich flavors. I will travel back to Montreal just to eat here again.
/user_details?userid=mGmBvAOKXFvXyqAmRpqyPA,John N.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"This is a great family restaurant - a little quiet sanity in the craziness of Crescent St. in Montreal.  This place really feels like a legit small family Italian place.  I kept it simple - an antipasti plate and pasta with marinara sauce, plus a glass of House red wine.The antipasti plate was exactly what I expected.  Very good.  The fresh tomato was *really* good.  Just a bite, but now in August, it was everything a good tomato should be, and did not taste like an industrial product (sad joke, given just how bad grocery store tomatoes in the U.S. are these days).  The mozzarella went with it very well.The bread was a bit of a disappointment - it would have been great to have some really fresh bread, but it was okay.The pasta and sauce was just fine, with fresh grated parmigiana cheese and fresh cracked pepper on top.  Just the way I like it.   I go for the simple straight forward dishes.  If they can get these right, then the more complex stuff is usually good as well.  Again, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked just right.So I would suggest this place if you are looking for a good place in Montreal with that family-run Italian feeling.BTW, I looked at the selection of wines and it looked great."
/user_details?userid=8JgjIUQr1y7TITZqB7Al0A,Taymour Q.,"Kensington, London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Last time I visited this wonderful restaurant was way back in 1992. Alberto and Guido always greeted me with the warmest smiles and hospitality.  I cannot believe this trattoria is still amazing.  Warm atmosphere, delicious home style food that you simply cannot go wrong with.  It's not just a restaurant to me where I can have heartwarming food that nourishes my soul, but an old friend you can rely on who is unpretentious and stable.  Can't wait to come back."
/user_details?userid=bkLY-O1DtjYYpB-20ezkiA,Lindsay M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant was awesome! The food was so amazing. Authentic Italian, the best risotto I have ever tasted! The other patrons in the restaurants were long time customers, 40+ years and super friendly. Shoutout to the chef!"
/user_details?userid=Bxa1EJhl-86moqZimeG5dA,Donya A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,We had dinner here on a recent visit to Montreal. Food was very good overall a little salty. Pasta and sauce were fresh we had the chicken fettuccini and veal parmesan . The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's got a cozy feeling to it inside. At the end of your meal you get a bowl of walnuts and clementines which was a nice touch :) overall it was good!
/user_details?userid=OGZzZCLBhLxQQggTt4u2Ww,Luisa S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Cozy and romantic atmosphere. Fancier but still reasonably priced. Really enjoyed the food.
/user_details?userid=q-GHoZtZIqzITYfGx51Djg,Karen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Trattoria Trestevere is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in Montreal located conveniently downtown.My family has been going here for years. It is our go to for a celebratory meal. The salads and minestrone are delicious, as are all of the pasta dishes and desserts (tiramisu and tartufo). I highly recommend it!!"
/user_details?userid=LSXqKE7u1gSWeCTdRUFhnA,C L.,"Westchester County, NY",2 star rating,"I have been raised on great Italian food, this was ok but overpriced for what we had.  One waiter was condescending, we should have left."
/user_details?userid=U-3Hwe0oEwQV5XxqiaypbA,Ayesha H.,"Davis Square, Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Love this little Italian restaurant! After walking the city all day we were tired and starving. The comfy, home-style Italian food from this place was just what we needed! The waiter said that they stay open for as long as people come in, so it's a great place for a late night bite!"
/user_details?userid=mp_WX7zcx0Dr4gdggqKteQ,David H.,"Burlington, NC",5 star rating,"""ORGASMIC"" !!! I was in Montreal on business and was directed to Crescent Street for good food, but all I found were tourist bars(I am not too keen on bar food)!  But then i found this humble old little 2 foot by 2 foot sign leading to a basement that said ""Trattoria Trestevere Ristorante"".  There are little windows at foot level and I could see that the atmsophere looked classy yet homey, with white linen table cloths, well set out dinnerware, small tables, etc.  As I made my way down and entered the place I instantly fell in love with the well lit yet cozy atmosphere.  Candlelit tables, short ceilings, adult staff,etc.  My typical 30 minute dinner turned into an incredible 3 hour vacation to Italy.  The grown up waiter(man of about 50 years) professionally took my order, lit my candle, brought my bread and antipasta, patiently helped me order in english (they speak french and italian in this place with just enough english).  The place was full and every waiter had 2 tables to tend to, thats it, just 2. The whole time the Maitre d surveyed the place like  an eagle hunting for prey and if 1 thing was not to his standards there was this unspoken language between him and the waiters that was going on which was an art in itself.  Now to the food, the bread, OMG, its that good, simple but perfect!  Ample selections of wines and beers.  Perfect Caesar salad with obviously homemade dressing.  I ended up eating here 3 times of my 5 night stay, it was that good!  I had veal(yes real veal, not veal burger),  seafood pasta, and i forget what else. I cannot imagine that any dish here would be anything less than the best of its class.  Deserts were perfection.  The after meal coffee was obviously imported from Italy.  I miss this place like I miss my grandmother!  If you want to impress that special girl, she will melt in your arms after a dinner here, you need not go out dancing afterwards, just make this exquisite experience your whole night.  Great place to dine with close friends or family, but maybe a bit too cozy a place for a business dinner(your colleague may think you are sweet on him/her).  I did feel a bit out of place alone here, but was treated like a King, and I loved it!   Whole meals(salad, bread, appetizer, main course, desert, coffee, and wine or beer) would cost between 30$ and 55$ per person.  My best dining experience ever!"
