/user_details?userid=kF_K5t37qlpk1S_brB1Dkg,Alexis P.,"Columbus, OH",4 star rating,"Line was out the door when we got there, so i thought that was a good sign even though I'm super impatient. It is a tight squeeze and i brought my bags straight from the airport, that's wasn't amazing. Anywho, I started off my brunch with a mimosa, it was delicious like most mimosas are. The bourbonade was much better than the mimosa, but i am a bourbon gal to the core. It was super tart, so if you aren't a fan of twisting up your face after drinking something, this isnt the drink for you. I, however, thought it was amazing. The eggs benny was really good. I ordered it a different way, but the waitress entered it in a way that was most cost effective!It's Montreal, so French! Most also speak English, so you won't be completely impaired, but get familiar with saying ""désolé, je parle pas français"""
/user_details?userid=Nq6e5N8bjgD9B46O4va_zA,Sarah S.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down some of the best chicken and waffles ever! Definitely beats the chicken and waffles at some of the brunch restaurants in Toronto. The okonomiyaki was good too - I wanted to try out a non-typical brunch item on the menu and ended up going for the Japanese pancake. The okonomiyaki was interesting since it had a French Canadian twist on it - they've used red cabbage instead, and there was no fish flakes on top of the the pancake like they do with traditional Japanese okonomiyaki. Despite the twist, you can still taste a bit of the fish flakes inside of the pancake and it was otherwise a pretty good pancake. The breakfast poutine was delicious!! The fries were fresh and the egg complimented the gravy very well. I also recommend the mango lassi. It was a refreshing balance against the deep fried breakfast items. Staff were friendly and the wait outside of the restaurant wasn't too long. We waited about 10 minutes before we were let in (which is pretty good, especially since Fabergé is one of the better brunch places). Would definitely recommend coming here for brunch, especially if you don't want strictly French Canadian food - it's nice that they have some fusion items on the menu too!"

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another great Montreal brunch spot! I went there on peak hours on a Sunday at around 11:30am for the full Montreal brunch experience. Obviously, the experience is never complete if there isn't a line. I was accompanied by 2 other friends and we took different plates. I cannot comment on theirs since I didn't try it out.So now let's talk about the important stuff: the food. I was very hungry after the wait, which honestly was not that long - about 30-40 minutes. I decided on the full plate of chicken waffle, with extra side of 2 eggs and a mango lassi. The main course was very good, the chicken well crispy and the waffle just fluffy enough to accompany the salty chicken. I strongly recommend asking them for a side of maple syrup to have a better taste of the whole plate (sweet and salty type of thing). Needless to say, the portion was huge! It was my only meal of the day. As for the mango lassi, it was good, but nothing impressive, especially after tasting some at Indian restaurants. Would most likely come back another time to try other items on their menu after I am done trying all the brunch places in Montreal!"

I ordered the full sized chicken and waffles and my partner got the big breakfast. The fried chicken wasn't fried chicken but chicken tenders, and they weren't crispy, wasn't a fan. Both dishes had a lot of home fries, it was difficult to finish those. Overall, worth a try but would not come back."

/user_details?userid=i27n2r8kscamsvd0FSn4Fw,Christina A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My friends and I were in town for the weekend and settled on Faberge after finding it on some top lists for brunch in Montreal. I'm glad we came here! Everything was absolutely delicious!I was already expecting a line as it was Sunday but was glad to see that it wasn't too long when we arrived. It took about 20-30 minutes to get a seat for the 3 of us but it was expected, the place was packed!Between the three of us we ordered the daily special of Steak Beni, the Smoked Salmon Beni, the alouette omelette and shared a side order of poutine. Of course 2 of us had to get the lychee mimosa. I must say, this was one of the best beni's I've had. The hollandaise wasn't heavy at all and all the flavours were balanced. Usually I find eggs benedict to have too much vinegar flavour but this one was just right.Everything was super flavourful and cooked perfectly. My favourite part had to be the homefries! Even though they had cooled down by the time we got our meals, they were still crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend who's usually picky about her fries, ate every single piece. The poutine was also very flavourful with really tasty gravy and squeaky cheesecurds. To top this meal off, the lychee mimosa was great; the lychee flavour really peaked through. Service was good, a little slow at times but it was really busy. The waitresses were all very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. It's safe to say, I would definitely come back here to try more items on the menu."
/user_details?userid=UXpTrzITc0yg08sXftsa-w,Irene T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Great brunch spot but be sure to arrive early because the restaurant quickly fills up!We ordered a smoked salmon eggs benny on a mini Montreal sesame bagel and the Huevos Rancheros. They were both incredibly fresh and well made! The mini bagel was the perfect size and the hollandaise sauce was so well executed! I wasn't a fan of the beans in the Huevos Rancheros and it was a little bit too saucy. If you're the same, I'm sure you can ask them to omit the beans and have sauce on the side.We would definitely recommend Fabergé and would return!"
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",4 star rating,"Brunch has got to be my favorite meal of the day! Especially when there are Mimosas in the mix. Instantly, those two things struck gold for me when I saw their online menu. Plus...there was no way I was gonna leave Montréal and head to NY- without having Crêpes. What???If you don't mind the lines here, lay low and expect to wait a bit- it's just part of their game plan. But when you head inside though, the place is popping. Layout has all these different seating nooks with Booths and regular tables. And Black outline drawings, decorate their walls and ceiling. There's something for everyone here. My Nutella Crêpe was gooey and Chocolatey. While my husband went for a simple Croissant, with eggs and bacon. My Lychee and Passion Fruit Mimosas were equally excellent and unique. Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of their food. Breakfast was simple and nicely made. Totally cozy spot- Calls for another visit!"

Even on Yelp Montreal, the ratings are pretty high. Either I went on a wrong day or the quality of food and service went down.There was a bit of tiny a line up, but we were seated within 5 minutes. I didn't find the spot clean. I felt very crummy and sticky the place. Our waiter was average.  He told us the service will be very long since it is super busy. I turn around, the restaurant is half empty. He brought my coffee; spills around the saucer. My coffee tasted ok, but leaving a dry taste afterwards that was bothersome. He brought my sister mango juice, but it tasted cucumber, and she barely drank it. We wanted to notify the waiter, but he was always rushing and didn't seem in the greatest mood. Our food arrived, at least the my PBJ French Toast was delicious and my sister's Banana Nutella Crepe was good but nothing ordinary. Unfortunately, it was disappointing except the food. I don't think I will ever come back."
/user_details?userid=49v8lBcU0k4rzDfUbnDQzg,Liliane B.,"Anjou, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I got the chicken and waffles because it is their specialty and what seems like the best thing on the menu. I was not amazed by the food, but it was still quite tasty. The piece of choice for the chicken was tenders and they were crunchy, which was nice though a bit dry. I wish they were bigger, quite an expensive plate for just 2 little pieces of chicken. The waffle was just okay, a bit too eggy and dense instead of fluffy. One thing I did love was the potatoes and the barbecue sauce! The potatoes was perfectly crispy. The sauce and coleslaw paired really well with the meal. The place is pretty popular, so expect a lineup and slow service. My friend asked for mayo and never got it. I also got the golden milk which tasted okay. The portion are good though!"

It was not the worst but it's definitely down there on the list.The chicken tasted a bit sour--I assume that it was not a fresh batch. The waffles were rubbery and bland.After my complaint, I appreciate the waitress bringing the pulled pork to sub the chicken but it was very soggy and bland, not even a hint of salt and pepper.Ultimately, I left the restaurant feeling disappointed and dissatisfied."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"To be honest I've expected it to be on the same level as other popular brunch places in Montreal but it does lack at least a star or two.The place is cute and it does get pretty busy even during the week, the service is okay but slow. I think we've waited at least 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Overall, the food is okay, it's strong 3 and a half stars I'd say. The potatoes taste like it came frozen from a supermarket bag and looked overcooked too. There was 1 tiny piece of grapefruit slice as a fruit portion.  The omelette was good though and met my expectations.Overall it could be an option for brunch if you're in the area, I haven't tried their crepes or waffles so it's possible that my choice was not the best."

The menu is great, fried chicken and waffle omg, but the service and overall feeling when you're there is just eh. They're very busy so the servers are naturally curt and impersonal. It's normal but brunch is supposed to be more relaxed and fun. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles and it was good. I just had an issue with how cooked the chicken was, it was still a little pink inside. The waffles were also really bleh. The portion is more than fair for the price tag, but I'd rather it be cheaper and smaller. It was way too much food.Adam got the breakfast poutine and it was kinda small for the price. He also said the flavours were just ok."

I love its vibe, its menu, the service and the neighbourhood. Their menu is creative and there is something for everyone. Their brunch cocktails are awesome and their coffee and tea is excellent. I always take one of the eggs Benedict dishes because they make their own hollandaise sauce but their crepes and waffles are amazing and really generous portions. -40C or +40C, there is always a line so either arrive before 9 am to avoid the line or embrace the line by catching up with friends!"

You can tell by the mighty long line-up during peak brunch hours. The menu has inventive recipes of traditional brunch meals. I was adventurous the first time I went and wasn't disappointed by my choice. Also, they know how to make good coffees.The decor is bright and electric. I enjoy feeling like I am 10 again while watching classic Saturday morning cartoons on their TVs. Thankfully the cartoons are muted because their choice of music is great too. The staff is young, happy and nice. I strongly recommend!"

We did wait a few minutes to get our order taken, but ingot the feeling they are not there to rush you and want you to take your time. I had the Crepes Czar with bacon, spinach, tomatoes and hollandaise sauce and a poached egg on top. The whole thing was insanely delicious and the home fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The drip coffee was also excellent.

You who have to wait outside. The food was well worth the wait. We ordered a standard egg and sausage and bacon and home fries breakfast which was all done perfectly. It was served with a fresh toasted Fairmount bagel from across the street and refreshing slices of grace uit. We also ordered a side of French fries with spicy mayo. I'm but sure what the French fries were seasoned with but they were very delicious and memorable. Finally, we had the French today with fresh strawberries and English cream topping. It was probably the best French toast I've ever had and I could not recommend it more to anybody. The service was friendly and accommodating to our non-French speaking members of the party."

Faberge has amazing reviews so it was an obvious brunch choice. The place was bumping when we got there, SO MANY people waiting for tables. Most people looked like they were in big parties so we squeezed through the crowd (no easy feat) and asked how long it would be for two. We waited like 3 minutes for a table and got envious stares from those still waiting. Service was pretty good, coffee was good quality, and our eggs benedicts were tasty but nothing was extraordinarily good so I just couldn't understand why there was a such a long line. Overall I enjoyed my experience at Faberge because despite having such crowds, everyone was calm and the service didn't lack. But the food was standard good brunch food, nothing particularly stood out or impressed me in a way that would make me want to face a brunch line that long. I'd def recommend this spot for brunch/breakfast but be weary of a long wait on weekends!"

It is basically an institution in Montreal, people always recommend coming here, there is usually a line on the weekends if you show up after 11:00 AM. Because of all the ravings and high reviews, I had very high expectations of this place. To be fair, the food is good, it's fine really... it's just nothing to write home about. I have had better brunch in Montreal. It is also a little bit expensive, compared to other places. I have been here twice, the first time we tried the chicken & waffles, and the mac & cheese pulled pork benedict. These are very heavy dishes, so if you want something more light, don't order these. It was good, but not something I would want to eat a second time. The second time we ordered mushroom benedict and the steak benedict. Again, it was fine, but I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had. Maybe not worth the visit, if you have to wait in a long line."

It came with crispy pan fried potatoes and a small fruit bowl (pineapple, oranges, watermelon). I also ordered a coffee on the side. I love how they do coffee refills here with free of cost as some places don't. I LOVED the potatoes oddly enough... it was just the perfect crispy/crunchy texture on the outside with minimal salt.  My friends and I also ordered a poutine to share. I found the poutine a little bit salty, but then again... I'm from the states so maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about lol. Overall, I would definitely come back if it was nearby!"

Okay, okay, that's a little dramatic, let's go with extremely difficult. The options are endless and I was getting in a tizzy trying to decide which brunch place to try out. After much debate, we settled on Fabergé.We came on a Tuesday and arrived just before 11:00am. There was already a lineup inside (Montrealers don't mess around) but by the time we settled into our seats, the line stretched out the door. Crazy. Tip: make sure your whole party is there, otherwise they won't sit you.The vibe is chic but laid back. Love how there were 90's cartoons playing in the background. Talk about nostalgia. Even though the place is close quarters, there still is room to breath.Menu is broken down into sweets (crepes, french toast and waffles), benedicts, sandwiches, omelettes and eggs.- S'mores waffles ($14.00) - holy cow, this was awesome! I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but everything was well balanced. Gooey marshmallows, nice crunch from the graham crackers and a generous dose of nutella.- Le massif ($16.00) - the sides were completely forgettable. I wouldn't even waste stomach space eating those baked beans, blah. The rest was pretty standard fare and didn't have me jumping out of my seat like the s'more waffle. I liked the small cup of fruit.This place is hip and popular. Personally, I wouldn't be willing to wait with a line running out the door but I can see why people would like it."

As for the food here, absolutely loved the eggs benedict and the Nutella crepe. The drip coffee was good, but I had to call the waiter a couple of times to get a refill.

She said there would be a long line up and is better to go earlier in the morning. We went around 9am I think and there was no line. Inside is very chic and instagram worthy. Service was great and if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free pop! I didn't really know what to order and I was looking online at their menu to decide earlier. Opted for the default breakfast plate with bacon eggs, toast and the potato. Not sure what it was.. because like. It's such a basic breakfast plate but it was really good. I think my favourite was probably the potato pieces. It looked burnt but it was the seasoning that was on it that was more darker. It just had a lot of flavour to it. The eggs were the way I liked it and the toast was good too. I like to put the eggs, bacon together between toast to make a nice sandwich - just gets a little messy if you get sunny side eggs, ha!Overall, great vibes, great food, great service.

Our breakfast selections included: duo of crepes (banana & Nutella), Big Poppa (breakfast sandwich served with potatoes & fruit), classic eggs and Huevos Nuevos. The latter was eggs, guacamole and salsa verde served on a potato flatbread which I found to be more of a tortilla consistency as you would have to fold it over to eat it like a taco. I ate the filling only which was very good. It came with a nice side salad & rice. Portions are generous. Our group had coffee/soda but there is a good selection of beverages,  both alcoholic and non."

Looked at the menu and couldn't even decide from the wide variety of options! I settled for the Le Boston (French toast with dark chocolate and pastry cream), which was an amazing choice. The pastry cream was not too sweet and light and airy; a perfect combination! I also had a side of the poutine, which wasn't the best in the city, but it was still amazing. Seemed like it had a bit of an Asian flair to it; a bit of soy sauce in the gravy? Overall, the service was OK. We sat at the counter and they were quite busy, so it took some time to get served and to have our coffee refilled. I'd love to go back and eat more items from the rest of the menu."

They dont take reservations so be prepared to wait in line for 20-40 minutes for a table on the weekend.We were a group of 5 on a Sunday around 1230. We put our names down at nearby Lawrence and then queued at Faberge. I had heard great things about both. Protip if youre waiting for brunch on Fairmount ave --- get a fresh bagel to nibble on at Fairmount Bagels for less than 2$. I know I needed that to hold me over!Once we were seated at Faberge, we were quickly attended to, ordering juice and coffee. I had eggs benedict (the classic). The eggs were poached just right. The portions are quite large. The eggs came with potatoes and a small fruit salad. The hollandais sauce was a bit too heavy for my liking. I think next time I will ask for it on the side.Ambiance - its funky yet cozy. There are comics and pop art on the walls, purple wallpaper, benches, & big windows.

The place has a familial ambience and is not that ""hip""-looking like the other restaurants in Mile End. I was actually surprised because the interior decor was so much like the brunch places in downtown Montreal (read: Universel, Eggspectation, etc) but keeping up with the Mile-End vibe, the staff and the patrons alike seem very chill and enjoyable.We ordered Chicken Waffle which is basically classic waffles topped with boneless fried chicken with sides of spicy sriracha coleslaw and a bowl of fruits. The portion was so huge that I wish I had ordered just one to share with someone. The quantity is definitely worth the $16 pricing. The potatoes were full of flavor and I loved pairing it with the tomato dip. The fried chicken was crispy, even after I poured maple syrup on it. And it was warm till the last bite. Loved the coleslaw as well. I was so full by the time I could get to the fruits that I ended up skipping 'em. All in all. Great brunch item!But the stellar item for us was the bloody ceasar. I give that a 5/5 and definitely recommend that to any one who doesn't mind a spiked up spicy drink in the morning. I found the Ceasar very refreshing especially in the summer heat. I took a litchi Mimosa as well but I strongly recommend the Bloody Ceasar. Both cost $7.The only downside to Fabergé was the wait time fort the food. We waited almost 30mins for our food to come which I think is a bit too long. Otherwise, had a good experience."

The potatoes on each dish was good, but just a hint too much seasoning on top. We had high hopes for this place because its rated top on a lot of blogs!

So what is my problem ? They used to have a vegan option, change the eggs omelet into a hummus based omelet which is vegan friendly...well not anymore. This was the reason we went there (my girlfriend is vegan) and not L'Avenue for example. Now its almost the same, huge lines, fancy food (which is a bit pricey) and NO vegan options.

The very nice and friendly host gave us a nice spot in the private terrace at the back, which was super cute and relaxing on a summer Saturday afternoon. The servers here are great - friendly, attentive, and nice. Despite being very busy, they brought out our food very quickly. There is quite a wide selection to choose from the combined brunch and lunch menu. However, the food did not live up to our expectations. The Okonomiyaki (Japanese style pancake), was quite heavy and not the best. The Huevos Nuevos (potato flatbread with scrambled eggs) also left much to be desired. Perhaps we did not order the best dishes on the menu, as there are so many positive reviews and good words around this place, I want to give this place the benefit of doubt!

There can be quite a line even early in the morning but it's worth it for their breakfast creations.

We ordered what seemed to be the favourites of chicken and waffle and Mac and cheese eggs benny. The jalapeño Mac and cheese and sauce was more of a sweet and spicy taste and the Mac and cheese patty as bread was extremely dense. A bit too sweet and savoury for me as a breakfast dish compared to regular eggs benny. They gave a free mini smoothie in place of the sparkling soda check in though as they ran out.

Didn't get the terrace table and the inside is quite hot, but it wasn't that much of an issue.In terms of the food, I find that Fabergé is actually not as fancy as I thought, but the taste of the dishes we ordered was fairly good. I took the popular chicken waffle plate, amazing spicy chicken but waffle is average, the portion is incredibly big and I had a hard time finishing it. My friend tried their Boston French toast, quite good but much smaller than my plate. They put dark chocolate on top of the French toast, it's actually quite intensely savoury.

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"TLDR: Best brunch spot in Montreal.I'm very familiar with Fabergé, because I was fortunate to have them in my university building in my last year of university. They no longer have an express spot there, but I make a point to go to their restaurant on Fairmount at least once a year, which is not something I do for most places.I can attest to a third of the menu, and tell you that it's all delicious. If you order one of their heavier dishes just get their green smoothie to even it all out. The ginger is very refreshing.They also make the best poutines for Poutine week, so make sure to go and taste their concoction. Their regular house breakfast poutine is also fantastic. The servers are the nicest people in all the Montreal's restaurants and are very knowledgeable about the menu. Enjoy their food at a table, booth, or even the bar. You will have a great time no matter what you choose."

The set up is very simple and humble :)I took their chicken waffle, which is supposedly one of their popular dishes and people's favourite. I see the effort to be different, but i feel like those two don't mix together. Also, their waffle felt dry because of the lack of sauce (not because it wasn't properly made). The side of potatoes were not bad, but not extraordinary.My cousin took a breakfast poutine, and that was nothing short of awesome!We also had the opportunity to try their ""hong kong style coffee"". It was an item written on a board, and off the menu. It came in a glamorous mason jar, with whip cream and a biscotti. I'd give this drink a 3/5. The taste of the coffee was there (although it's actually a mix of tea and coffee), but this drink is supposed to be a simple beverage in hong kong culture. It's supposed to be served just like a regular coffee. Imagine I put whip cream on your tim hortons black coffee, and throw in a biscotti. Ah well, nice try though! If you take out all the glamour, it's not bad.Service is impeccable, timely dishes and constant coffee refills, as well as polite and engaging waitress :)Even though this review is a 3 star, i'd still go back and try other stuff on their menu, and i'd recommend this place!"

Service was quick and really good. Everything we needed and more. Negative: it's easy to tell that the kitchen is struggling to maintain the quality of food while keeping up with demand. We didn't wait too long for the food despite how busy it was, but my waffles were soggy (probably premade and left in a pile of waffles to be served) and my fried chicken was so hard to chew or cut probably because it was fried once, left out, then fried again. This was a serious offence to me because I friggen love waffles, and fried chicken. So that was a soggy experience. We will probably go again but go early if it's the weekend!"

They give you super big portions--it could feed two people and it's so delicious! The chicken is crispy and well spiced and the waffles are soft! They also give a variety of sauces to put on top so if you're the savoury type of person--you can put sriacha or chilli sauce or if you were craving something more sweet--like me, I put syrup on top. I know it sounds gross to put syrup on fried chicken but surprisingly, it was really good with the waffles! You can eat them separately of course, but just try eating it together at least once--makes the experience! Also, I stole a bite out of my friends Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny and that hollandaise sauce was 10/10 and they give you a good portion size of salmon unlike some other brunch places where you can barely even taste the salmon.Definitely coming back and trying their Benny Mac  :Dps: they have free wifi and sometimes they have cool yelp check-in offers which are free!"

A staff came out to take our names and group size so we could leave the line and pass the time (estimated 1 hour). I think the biggest contributing factor to the wait time is how long it takes the kitchen to serve food. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the benny mac and cheese. Noticing the check in offer on yelp, we also ordered ""sparkling sodas"" which we were told is just pop. A little misleading, if you ask me... Service is just A-Ok. The restaurant is decorated nicely in a contemporary style, with simple plastic backed chairs and minimalistic tables. The murals on the walls are pretty cool to look at.The food itself is good, but not nearly worth the 1 hour wait for table and another 30 minute wait for it to reach our table. Eggs benny is pretty standard but the mac and cheese was too chewy for my taste. The pulled pork was a nice touch and helped cut the heaviness. Portions are fair - I didn't finish the home fries. Chicken was well seasoned but unfortunately there wasn't enough to go with the thick waffles. Worth a visit if the line is short. 3.5 stars."

There were a lot of things here that looked instagram worthy, but they're known for their chicken waffles. The portion was massive, and way too much food for early hours of brunch, haha. The fried chicken was perfectly fried, but the waffles were slightly tough (not a problem, that's what syrup is for!) The coffee here is also endless, so that's always a plus.Definitely worth a stop, especially since they play some old school cartoons (Pinky and the Brain)."

Waffles are thick and arent cripsy. The batter is lacking sweetness or overall just create a new batter. No matter how much syrup I put on the waffles, they remained dry and heavy. But what blows my mind is the quality of food that is put out from the kitchen. All plates should be checked by the chef, the server and the waitress before being placed on the clients table. We ordered the Belle province and the OG with strawberries. When the OG came out I couldnt believe my eyes!! It was a plate of waffles with two strawberries, REPHRASE a strawberry cut in half! Not to mention that Belle Province waffle was missing the whip cream. What angers me is that the kitchen allowed these plates to leave their kitchen and they had the balls to serve this to a paying customer. Honestly, a lot of people wouldn't dare to say anything, afraid that their plates would be tampered with. Do not be rude about it but speak up if your food is shitty! You're paying for  your food, you should get it the way it was advertised. Our waitress was completely understanding and gave us the rest of our waffle. In conclusion, I will not be returning because the food isnt anything great. The kitchen and the serving staff need to be reevaluated. I dont know if the kitchen got lazy with our plates but it is not acceptable! If you're going to spend money on breakfast, do it right and go elsewhere like Petinos."

My favourite dish is definitely the mac and cheese eggs benedict (they are much better than the chicken and waffles!!!) The mac and cheese is fried to a perfect crispy texture and then topped with ham and poached eggs and finished off with hollandaise sauce. It is so delicious but so heavy and so fatty. They are also quite know for their chicken and waffles, with very crispy chicken, syrup (definitely opt for maple syrup even thought it is extra) and soft sweet waffles. One of my friend got the peanut butter and jelly french toast and it is the only dish from them that I wouldn't recommend, not because it is not good but because it does not compare to the rest of their menu. Overall, great fatty brunch place, make sure to come early because the lineups get crazy around 10:30!"

We bypassed the groups of 3 and 4 waiting in line because we were a group of 2. As per most brunch places, the seating was fairly cramped; however, the atmosphere was charming as it had cartoons playing on the TV. I ordered the Benny Mac which was delicious. The eggs were perfectly poached, the pulled pork was amazing, and the fried Mac and Cheese was wonderful. Jalapeno jelly was sweet rather than spicy but nevertheless provided a nice kick to the meal. The potatoes were SOO GOOD.Charming server and short wait time for food make for an overall wonderful time!"

There was a long line, however it was worth the wait. There was a large selection of things to choose from, such as benedicts, crepes, waffles and drinks. They had fresh squeezed juice with the options of orange or grapefruit or half and half. We waited a while for our food as we were a large group and the restaurant was busy. Our server attended to our needs as soon as she could giving us water and our drinks while we waited. When the food came, our group was silenced once we starting eating. I ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed. The chicken was seasoned well and accompanied my soft waffles. I asked for table syrup which completed the medley of savory and sweet flavours. The dish came with a side of potatoes and coleslaw. The potatoes were crunchy and soft and delicious. The slaw was the perfect mix of crunch, acidity and sweetness. The full portion was quite large with 4 pieces of chicken and a full waffle, don't order unless you have a large appetite."

The wait was about 20-25 min. So not as long as you'd think. The fare is kind of like the new wave diner/brunch spots even here in the States with many brunch favorites with the breakfast usuals amplified in portion, addition and presentation. I got the Chicken and waffles. I may have to say it was the best I've had thus far. 2 big waffles cut into 4 pieces, with capital ""C"" crispy cutlets on each one with bbq sauce for dipping and syrup. Also has a fruit cup, seasoned potatoes and relish cup. Their proud Montreal premium syrup will run you a couple extra dollars or else you gotta settle for their regular syrup. The premium comes in a ok sized tin dip cup. The place gets packed and isn't even small with front and back outdoor seating a quite a few indoor tables. Service was pretty good but the meal was great. If you can handle a bit of a line, you may be in for a treat here."

I need to come back for that.The next speciality is the Chicken waffle a classic American dish. I only tasted the fried chicken and i have to admit the crispy and the seasoning was on point.I didn't have the chance the eat the combination of chick and waffle but next time for sure.The only bad comment i have is about the Steak and egg.

I had the Benny Mac = poached egg with hollandaise on deep fried Mac and cheese patties. This was a really nice twist on the classic Benny. I'm not really a Benny tradionalist but if you are maybe this brunch would be offensive. I loved it. The Mac and cheese patty was fried well, crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. The egg yolk saturated the deep fried Mac and cheese while eating and made it even better. My only feedback would be to add a tad more flavour to the Mac and cheese. Though the jalapeño jelly was a nice addition, could be spicier though. Comes with home fries and bowl of fruit. Overall really fun brunch in a cool setting.

Every time I come to Montreal I have to make a stop otherwise the trip isn't worth ;PThere is almost always going to be a line because it's always busy and the place is a little cramped but it will always be worth it. The servers are adorable, super-friendly and really do care. The space is very cozy albeit a bit tight and it is the most chill place ever. Always check-in for their free _______ (Yelp says soda but their soda machine is broken for now so I got the Rouge smoothie which was delicious!) After a night of alcohol and karaoke, I needed something nice and greasy to make me feel better. The last time I was here I ordered a poutine on the side and it was the best poutine I've ever had (sorry not sorry La Banquise) so this time I ordered their Montreal Poutine (8$) in all its fullness but added two sunny side eggs (1$ each) on the side to put on top to make it more breakfasty. Best decision of the morning. It was everything a poutine should be--crispy French fries, topped with a beautiful brown gravy with lots of cheese curds topped with fresh scallions, with additional modification par moi of golden egg. They have a nice list of extras so you can personalize your meal for a couple of bucks. Go ahead! Add a poutine on the side for 3-4$ :) I got a good hearty meal for about 11.50$ and I felt like I wasn't paying enough for it. If you're a tourist please come here.

Someone quickly told us to pick some seats and we did.... and waited over 20 minutes for someone to come talk to us. Normally this would have been a deal breaker but we were pretty engaged in conversation to feel outraged by this long wait.Eventually we did get someone to come take our order and I went with their reputed chicken and waffles with some much needed cappuccino. CHICKEN N' WAFFLES BABY! The food arrived about 25 minutes later. So, let's break it down shall we? The chicken was very good, crisp and moist all at the same time. Excellent! However, the waffles were pretty disappointing in comparison as they were very soft, were cold and flavorless. I felt these might not have been as fresh as they should have been.The maple syrup was authentic, the fruits were fresh/tasty and the potatoes were somewhat OK - I've had far better. The cappuccino wasn't for me. Was it the way it was done? Or I disliked what coffee beans that were used? I wouldn't know, it was pretty bad.The price tag is a bit steep considering that the meal in globally left a lot to be desired. The service was about average even after the disastrous start. All in all, forgettable.Was it an off day for Faberge? Possibly. However, I don't see myself coming back and that's why off days can be pretty costly to businesses, in terms of losing clients and more importantly slightly negative reviews that come from them."

It was hard picking a brunch spot out of the TONS of recommendations. The wait was about 20 minutes and it went by much quicker than I would have expected. We got a table in the patio/garden in the back...SUCH a cute area (and the perfect sunshiney weather just added to it.) I was super impressed with our waiter and the general service. He remembered every tiny detail (like what condiments to bring on the side) of a group of 9 demanding ladies. It was a little annoying that they charged extra for every condiment (like maple syrup...) I think what makes me rate this place a five stars is definitely because of the service. Some of us split dishes, got our own and also ordered a bunch for the table to share. My favorites were: 1) the chicken and waffles..the combination of the flavorful chicken and freshly made waffles was just exquisite. 2) The Shakshouka..again super flavorful. Some of the best i've ever had, definitely had a kick with out going overboard. 3) Crepe at the end was amazing...bananas, strawberries, nutella. Friends were very happy with their omelettes/scrambled eggs filled with veggies and egg burrito.  My cappucino didn't seem strong enough but who knows...

The prices for the bottles of champagne and the juices were worth every penny (great juice flavors with the unique lychee, peach, and pear) and my gin cocktail was every bit as strong as I needed that morning. Of course the Okonomiyaki was pretty good, the batter used was not authentic (more pancake then the traditional thin batter) but worked for the fusion dish they were trying to pull off.

While browsing what touristy culinary treats we had to try, I came across their fabled chicken and waffles. My previous (and only other) experience with the dish was at the Pickle Barrel, and that had been outstanding, so I was hoping for a repeat.As we waited, we took in the innovative interior decor, which is a little hard to describe in a couple words. It's cool, it's modern, there's a Flavor Flav clock, children's drawings, etc.They started us with a complementary small blueberry shake for their Yelp check-in promotion. Right after I got my hands on a refreshing caesar, garnished with cherry, pickle, cucumber, and lemon.Then came the chicken and waffles. It was... pretty good. Unfortunately, it didn't have the same irresistible quality as my previous experience, but I was happy. The chicken was nice and juicy, with mildly powerful seasoning, and the waffles were A-OK. I was sort of hoping for something special with respect to the waffle, but again, it was solidly good. I'd suggest opting for their real maple syrop, which costs a smidge more, but the flavour makes up for it.The dish is served with a small fruit bowl, a coleslaw-esq salad, potato wedges, and a barbecue sauce. The barbecue sauce was an unfortunate downside to the plate. It just wasn't all that good, especially when the potato wedges needed some help.All in all, I'd be more than happy to head back to Fabergé. The service is stellar, they serve up a breakfast that hits the spot, and the decor is great. I'd suggest trying the Benny Mac. My friend had it, and walked out a little more joyous than I was."

I ordered a regular iced latte (because it was quite hot in the restaurant!), but the other lattes and cappuccinos looked fabulous *see pic*. The bloody mary was also really good! I was literally envious of everyone who got a mimosa, but I just really needed coffee too badly. The food was also really delicious. I got Le Fume. Which was tasty. The salmon could have had a more smoky flavor and I think the mini bagels were just a tad too hard (could barely cut them!), but the potatoes and fruit were good. Le classique looked a little bit better in terms of ""cut-ability"", which is probably what I would get the next time. All the other dishes looked good too, the crepes and the waffles look amazing... To think of trying those the next time.Overall, we were pretty satisfied."

So I was up for something new and greasy this time.The breakfast poutine seemed just too greasy, and I was not feeling the healthy option of spinach omelet. I found my fit in the rustique benedict eggs (eggs, english muffins, sauce along with mushrooms, with potatoes and fruit of course). Everything was good, but cold. Cold potatoes, cold muffins.. I have no brunch luck! Still the potatoes were good, so were the eggs - although one was runny, the other cooked through. I decided to go all in, and ordered a lavender latte. That I could not recommend. It's served in a mason jar - Pinterest friendly! But it's a lot of latte and no coffee at all. For $6 I wouldn't bother.Some stars are missing because of that, and the very small space. The waiter looked baffled that my friend and I arrived separately, so I was parked in front of the door for a bit, in front of empty tables. Thankfully I was seated, or should I say neatly folded? It's really cramped guys. A family was next to us, and I pretty much became a member right then and there."

For food we ordered the Meat Eater and the Eggs Benny special. The Mac and Cheese Benedict had fried Mac and cheese as the base instead of English muffin, pulled pork, poached egg and hollandaise. As with their other brunch options, it came with fruit and potatoes. This eggs Benny was UNREALLLL -- Definitely the right call this morning. Service - When we first got there the service felt a little disorganized. The food arrived before we even got our coffees and smoothie. Towards the end they were quick to refill coffees and check up on us."

I went on Thursday morning so there wasn't a line for me but I know this place is notorious for long weekend brunch lineups. There was no seating on the patio available but the interior is extremely cute and well decorated. I found there to be ample natural lighting which makes me very happy. I ordered the Bonhomme crepe which was a traditional crepe filled with apples and cheese. Sounds like a gross combo? No, it was heavenly. I think the classic breakfasts are nothing special but try some of their more adventerous options and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

The decor of this place is also pretty amazing. It had a very modern feel to it that made the experience and even better one.

My friend and I are both huge brunchers, if I may, and we were blown away by this place. We were seated immediately on a Saturday, during prime brunch time. The interior is really cool and fun, and they play cartoons on the screens, which I think is a cute touch. My friend and I agreed that the spot is reminiscent of the many Brooklyn brunch spots. As for the food, I can confidently say, the eggs benedict I had here are the best I've ever had. They were SO full of flavor and I only wish it was never-ending. We had the chicken and waffles, which were quite good and the home fries that accompanied it were delicious and seasoned well. The plates also came with a nice small bowl of fruit, balancing out the dish well. The only disappointing part was my matcha latte. It was essentially milk with a slight matcha taste - but our server/bartender was more than happy to add more matcha to it. To top it all off, our server was amazing! He was so nice, friendly, extremely accommodating and even recommended great places to visit and go out in Montreal for a good time. Will definitely be back the next time I visit Montreal!"

When the waiter came I asked him to make me a bicycle on my latte (probably with a bit too much enthusiasm). He laugh and said he'll see what he can do. Boy, I have to say he outdid himself.

The art on the walls and the cartoons on the TVs are uplifting and interesting and busy without being too dizzying when hungover (an important consideration when making a brunch choice.) Their food truck does a delicious pulled pork sandwich. Aside from that I've not yet been blown away by the food. A basic egg and bacon breakfast is over-priced here, and the breakfast poutine, while a yummy novelty, was just too heavy and sticky for me to enjoy past a bite or two. I'm glad this place exists, glad there are more brunch options in the area, but have been left unthrilled thus far by the food and coffee itself, or at least by what you get for what you pay."

The service was very fast although the restaurant was half full and for 5$ the latte came in a huge cup. Unfortunately, the cup was half filled with cream. The presentation was nice but both the matcha and the latte were lacking in flavour.I went on to order the waffle and chicken which was recommended to me as their specialty. It came with a small salad, a small portion of fruits, some potatoes, some maple syrup and some tomato sauce. For 15$ it was a bit pricey but you get what you paid for. The fried chicken pieces were huge but well cooked and very tasty. I couldn't finish my plate even after sharing a few pieces. The waffles were less impressive but with some maple syrup they were just as delicious.Overall the friendly staff and the beautifully painted walls and ceiling made for a very positive experience. Next time (because there'll definitely be a next time) I'll need to remember to order a smaller plate. 4/5"
/user_details?userid=Cbi8PKa-9vlvF_AxTpdzuQ,Darren M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2 star rating,"I'm giving this place two stars out of generosity.  The service was beyond terrible and the food not much better.  We were seated in a fair amount of time, maybe 4-5 mins but I think we waited for almost 10 minutes just for the waitress to come get our order.  5 minutes later we got one of the two coffees we ordered.  My GF had to call her over.  I wanted to just pay for the coffee and leave but she assured us the breakfast was coming right out.  It did come out fairly soon after that, but was not worth waiting for.  There is a sign on the door looking for help, and it's pretty obvious the current staff is overwhelmed with what they have.  So instead of giving this place the 1 star it deserves, I gave it two because I think the management might be having staffing problems and I sympathize.  When we left there was a line to get in so I don't think they'll suffer much from the bad service or mediocre / substandard food as they seem to be the only place open before 10:00 on a Sunday, but next time I'm in Mile End I'll wait till 10:00 to have better options."

Now, as a rule, I only goto places that are extremely vegetarian friendly, and I'd been told by several friends that this place is definitely accommodating to vegetarians. First, the good - The service was very good. Our server was friendly, flawlessly bilingual, and generally a pleasure.The menu very clearly has a Tofu scramble dish, which is the goto vegan breakfast option for many people,  but as an ovo veg, I tend to go for simple egg dishes. I opted for the classique, two eggs, choice of meat, fruit, and bread. The bread selection was impressive, but I'm sad to say Fabergé breaks my cardinal rule - accommodation, by subtraction, not substitution, is not accommodation. This also holds if you make someone pay extra to change their dish with a cheaper option, with a carte blanche, ""$1 charge for all substitutions.""One dollar isn't going to break the bank, obviously, but the principle of it means I won't be going back until they drop that ridiculous policy."

The wait wasn't too bad, since we got here around 2:15pm (can't imagine what the line is like at normal brunch times). I ordered the ""le fume"" which was the smoked salmon benedict. It came with several thick slices of smoked salmon and poached eggs on top of cream cheese and 2 halves of a mini Montreal-style sesame bagels, with crispy capers sprinkled on top. It also came with a small side of fruit (mine had pineapple, cantaloupe, orange slices and green grapes) as well as hashbrowns. I also ordered black coffee with steamed almond milk. The only issue I had with my order was that I ordered hollandaise sauce on the side, however the chef poured it on top of my eggs benedict. The waiter was extremely courteous about it though, and asked if I wanted it re-made (I just scraped most of the sauce off and told him it was fine). Overall, the smoked salmon benedict was delicious and extremely filling for $16. I would definitely order it again!It was difficult to decide on what to order since the menu was so extensive and really everything looked delicious. I think next time I'll try one of their specialty waffles or an omelette. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles (which was HUGE), and she raved about it after. My other friends ordered the mac and cheese benedict special with pulled pork on top, the breakfast poutine special (it's poutine week!) and the breakfast burrito (which was okay but not great). They charge you extra for sides of almond milk ($1 per small pot) so make sure you don't ask for too many. Overall, my bill came to $21 with tax and tip, which is a little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it for the food and atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!"

The place: Pretty cool - they had some funky art happening on the main wall by the window that I liked. The place has a pretty relaxed feel to it and there's lots of yellow. Or maybe it's beige... Something like that. Anyway, the vibe is chill. In terms of clientele, there was a good mix of people but sadly, I couldn't complain about the Hipsters taking over the place. Not yet, anyway - I'm sure that's temporary. You'll find people of all ages and dress codes with no pretense whatsoever. The food: They have a pretty varied menu and I was in one of those moods where I didn't feel like reading so I skipped right to the omelets. These are build-your-own and all you need to do is select three ingredients and voilà - you're done. I went for caramelized onions, wild mushrooms and breakfast sausage because I was feeling a little meaty. My omelet arrived, piping hot, with a side of potatoes and fruit. I enjoyed the omelet very much; it was nice and fat and had the perfect mixture of ingredients - not too much or too little of one ingredient over another.  The potatoes left me feeling indifferent, however. They were crispy on the outside, which I like, but the inside was very dry so I suspect they were over-cooked. Additionally, they were sorely lacking in flavor. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and loved them. Apparently their specialty is chicken and waffles so I'd like to try that out. I really had to fight back the urge to pull a Bill Murray and grab a waffle out of my neighbor's plate - them waffles looked REAL good!Service: Pretty good. We were greeted upon entering and they prepared a table for us very quickly. There did seem to be a lot of employees floating around the place - I constantly felt like I was surrounded by waiters.Overall, I liked this place and would return. The only downside was where we were sitting - right by the door. Every time someone came in, we felt the cold draft, and people sort of piled up right behind me. The up side is that we were right by the window, so there was a lot of natural light."

We got the eggs benedict served on top of pulled pork and a mac and cheese bun! It was accompanied by these unbelievable breakfast potatoes. The eggs were really heavy, I think things would taste better if they had some sort of pop somewhere. But anyways, I still think that it tasted really good. I got the El jefe, I'm not too impressed because it's just a burger bun with an egg, bacon and guacamole. And it's really messy to eat since the eggs just breaks down. My husband just love breaking yolks so he devoured most of the sandwich. However, although we got seated right away, it took them almost an hour for us to get our food, but luckily we got to sip on our beautiful cappuccino with a leaf coffee art.

I had heard about their chicken waffle so we ordered some. But it didn't exceed the expectations: the chicken was crunchy, but it didn't taste anything special. The waffles were just plain. The sauce did match the chicken though. Overall, the plate wasn't a ""wow"". We also ordered the fumé (egg benedictine) with smoked salmon and bagels. It was again so-so... Since our wait for the food was pretty long, our overall experience was not as enjoyable."

Read great reviews and was not disappointed. The shop has a hip and younger crowd and staff. Some tvs up on the wall for light entertainment, they were showing cartoons, inspector gadget! The food was excellent, I ordered smoked salmon Benedict with capers and London fog to drink. Everything was excellent and I was able to use my free Yelp offer to get my tea on the house! This place is fairly popular so be wary of lines and crowds, patience will be needed as the food can take a bit of time to come out. Overall a great dining experience and Id recommend a visit."

The location is great, and the restaurant itself is adorable. I was, however, very disappointed in the service. We were sat at the window seat and were basically forgotten for quite some time. We sat there for 15 minutes before we were even greeted, and when we were greeted we received a lovely excuse about how our waiter was too busy to help us. Then, I ordered the Burrito Rico and had some questions about questions about some of the ingredients and the ""stand in"" server proceeded to disagree with me about my question. When the food came out, it was AMAZING. When our actual server came, he was very friendly and helpful. Overall, this place is worth the try. A+ for food C- for service."
/user_details?userid=eRKEFyUmQD8562fDJHTwIQ,Hannah M.,"Minneapolis, MN",3 star rating,"Looked for a breakfast place that wasn't too diner feeling and found this place. Checked in and each received a free drink and used that for lattes. When we first came in the guy was friendly and told us to sit anywhere. We ordered drinks first- bf got the plain latte and I got a soy chai latte. We were both very happy that the drinks ended up free because unfortunately both of our lattes were bland and just tasted very milky and with very little taste of our latte. We had some really good coffee and lattes through out our trip in Montreal so at this point we just expected better from our drinks. 1 star off just because I feel that breakfast/brunch cafe should have good or even great coffee. I ordered a salmon benedict which came with potato wedges and some fruit. It was delicious and the bf was very happy to finish off my plate when I could not stuff my face anymore. The bf ordered chicken and waffles which I loved that they had on the menu. The chicken was crispy and juicy and the waffles were nice and sweet. Delicious plate. I truthfully am being picky but I feel the place deserves 1 star off because you have to pay $1 or $2 extra for real maple syrup. Not cool. Overall the food was good, just not great. And a plus to our server, he was very nice to us and kept checking on our table throughout our long breakfast."

The problem started when it took another 15 minutes to take our order upon being seated, and another 45 to get any food at all. This is entirely unacceptable, especially when the waitress completely ignored us when we asked for more drinks to tide over our hunger.Upon receiving our order (eggs benny, crepes and omlettes) the breads were both soggy, and the omelette was runny on one side. I can highly recommend the smoothies but that's about it.I can't say I'll ever want to return - they need to really step up their service."

Really nice spot to have private conversations! The service was good, waiters were nice. I had benedictine eggs which were good but not amazing. I planned on trying the waffle and chicken since I haven't been to any good place for that in Montreal so far."
/user_details?userid=RO55qRu4TvHogzSOGERxKA,Anahita M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"For the hype that was built for it online, I found the food at Faberge to be just mediocre. The restaurant is located in a very cute area in Mile End and the decor inside gives off a cool hipster brunch vibe. The restaurant doesn't take reservations so you will have to wait at least 20 minutes outside if you come for brunch during the weekend. Also, they have free wifi inside which is always good. Now when it comes to food, I ordered the Chicken and Waffle plate (a dish I've had many times before as I previously lived in southern USA)  and was not very impressed. The waffle was a bit cold and the chicken was quite dry. The best part of the dish was the barbecue sauce it was served with, which was delicious, and the potatoes which were well seasoned! My friend ordered the Sante Benedict and liked it but she also ordered a Chai Latte and said it wasn't good at all and tasted like warm milk. Overall, the best part of this restaurant is the casual brunch vibes and the environment rather than the actual food."
/user_details?userid=DZmS1YmI0qwFA_6PrjDSnA,Wendy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Food was agreeable, good but didn't blow me away. My husband loved it though, he got an omelette (Expos) and cleaned it right up. I got the pork mac and cheese benny (Benny Mac) and we shared a nutella crepe.Both main dishes came with a side of potatoes, they looked a little burnt and tasted bland. My eggs benny was pretty good, the pork was tender and served as a good combination with the mac and cheese.As a fan of eggs bennies, I feel like the hollandaise sauce makes or breaks the experience and the one accompanied with this dish was just alright. Yolk's has set the standard high for me in terms of eggs bennies + potatoes. All in all, it was a good experience. Good ambiance and our waitress was amazing, she was really tentative and friendly.

I sent it back and when I received my next one the egg was over cooked and the English muffin very chewy. Would not recommend that dish at all. We also ordered a hot chocolate that was very yummy. The restaurant was very busy and very loud so perhaps the issues I had with my dish were just due to the staff being overwhelmed. I'd try them again if I lived in the area but I don't."

They told us beforehand that we will be coming here for brunch. I didn't do any research prior and from the name, I sort of assumed it was some sort of Russian tea salon decorated with bejewelled eggs... Boy was I wrong! And in a good way too.We didn't have to wait long on this sunny but brisk Sunday morning. Going earlier is key. Many items on the menu all sounded tempting, but when I see chicken and waffles, I must get it. I just can't help the urge. I don't know why I set myself up for it, because often times I'm let down.  Well this plate impressed. Four fluffy quarters of waffles and a big piece of chicken to go with each one. Easily shared between two people, it hit the spot. My partner also had the same order and we tried pawning off pieces of waffle and chicken to our friends. The pancakes looked tasty, next time I have a chance to come back, I'll have to try them. Their different coloured smoothies were delicious, but their mimosas can be too heavy on the juice rather than the sparkling.Friendly staff, cool decor, this spot was definitely not Russian themed."

They have a few mimosa options I had the lychee mimosa and let me tell you it was so good, I had 3! My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and I never seen him eat so fast before. I had the mac benny which is what they are known for. Instead of having your traditional English muffin it's deep fried mac and cheese with pulled pork, it was delicious. If you come here during the busy time and plan on having mimosas my tip for you is to order more than 1 at a time because the service can be a bit slow however the staff is so nice and pleasant to deal with. The space is small inside you are extremely close to the people sitting next to you so if you're expecting to have a quiet brunch this is not the place.

The menu is large and can accommodate many different kinds of dietary restrictions-- our group has, in the past, included someone who cannot eat dairy, someone who cannot eat gluten, a vegetarian, someone who cannot eat cilantro and someone with a severe peanut allergy. All found something tasty to eat without too many substitutions. They're also happy to accommodate large groups. Fifteen of us walked in on a busy Saturday morning without a reservation, and we were quickly and painlessly seated.There are some misses on the menu. The combination of the hollandaise sauce with the sauteed vegetables on the breakfast poutine leaves it too sweet, with the chicken in the chicken and waffles was on the tough side. On the other hand, The Big Cheese sandwich (get it with chicken!), the breakfast burrito, and the huevos rancheros were all spot-on. The house caesar, made with tomatillos, goes down easy, too. There are enough successes on the menu to keep Faberge its five stars.We've sometimes had issues sorting out our bills at the end of a meal, but this has only happened when we've been a large group, and our server has always worked hard to sort out the issues. For putting up with a big rowdy group, for some delicious menu items, and for an atmosphere that doesn't feel unbearably prententious, Faberge remains my favourite place to get brunch in Mile End."

/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you were to ask Montrealers what their favorite meal of the day is, there could be only one answer, breakfast of course. Here in Montreal we love breakfast. Especially on weekends where breakfast can be an  all day affair, for this reason many restaurants serve breakfast foods all day. So when we were invited to try the fare at Fabergé, how could we refuse after all they serve breakfast all day.Located on Fairmount Avenue West, just off the main thoroughfare of St. Laurent Blvd, Fabergé is centrally located and equally accessible by public transit and by car. The establishment itself is comfortable and inviting and every customer is given a warm welcome by some truly amazing staff.To start our adventure we decided to start our meal with a milkshake. Standard choices are available but also pumpkin and salted caramel. We received a recommendation for the salted caramel and it did not disappoint. Thick and sweet it was the perfect milkshake or so we thought. We were pleasantly surprised with a mango maple syrup concoction that you have to see to believe. The jury is in and this was officially the best milkshake we have ever tried.Now we did have our hearts set on breakfast, but alas we were in the middle of Montreal Poutine Week so we could not skip out on some fabulous poutine. So we went for two of the house specialties the poutine and the Benny Mac Benedictine.The poutine was comprised of potatoes covered with peppers and caramelized onions, Hollandaise sauce and cheese. We opted to have it topped with fried chicken and an egg served sunny side up.  For the Benny Mac, the English muffin was replaced with a macaroni and cheese fritter. It is served topped with pulled pork and jalapeno jelly and of course a poached egg. We decided to split the dishes and have both breakfast and lunch, or if you want to be politically correct the perfect brunch. These recommendations were spot on and beyond delicious.We always enjoy a restaurant where the staff can suggest a great dish, but we will always recommend a place where they get it just right. So on your next visit to the Mile End Neighbourhood of Montreal, you must make a stop at Fabergé for breakfast, lunch or just a milkshake."

Interesting art on the walls and vintage cartoons on their TV screens (is there anything better than 80's Transformers?)

However, since we went there probably on the busiest day of the week, as soon as we were done eating, bills came and so did the interac machine. The table was emptied besides our glasses of water.

First I had to wait in line for a table, but once I entered the restaurant I notice there were many tables available... Then I waited around 15 minutes to have my order taken.

Came on a weekday around 11am just in time for brunch, so we beat the hectic lunch hour. Cool mix of modern decor and hipster peeps, Captain Planet playing on the flat screens. I honestly came here for the cool latte art, but the food was just as good!  had salmon eggs benedict that came w/ a side of fruit, potatoes, & also ordered waffles w/ jam/whipped cream. Wish we tried a smoothie cause I think it was named after Celine Dione, haha. We also saw so many people ordering the breakfast poutine which looked amazeballz.

/user_details?userid=ay4M5J28kBUf0odOQct0BA,Thomas M.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"During spring break, me and my friends went on a road trip to Montreal for my friend's birthday and one day decided to stop at this place due to its popularity and reviews. The place was quite a sight to see, the decor, atmosphere and setup was quite comfortable. The restaurant seems to be split into two, one with sofas and the other with booths. The service was really friendly and the waitresses there were quite cute even though during lunch hours, it took some time for them to take our meals and such. Although, the waitress recommend us to try out their lattes that isn't in a mug and it was worth the wait. The presentation of the latte was unique and the taste was nothing that I ever tasted.. a much more better latte than in Toronto. For my appetizer, I ordered a crepe with REAL Maple Syrup and it was good but wasn't that delicious.  I tried out my friend's mac and cheese and had regretted not getting that instead of what I am about to ordered. Unlike many people here, I didn't have a great experience. I ordered the breakfast poutine which seems to be recommended and it unfortunately got me food poisoning and kinda ruined the whole day. Having potatos wedges with gravy, cheese and hollandaise sauce seems to have made it more salty and also the potato wedges were mostly burnt (which attributed to me going to the bathroom alot)..  However the waitress made up for it and I got a free large apple juice on the house which was kind of her. However the poutine there was delicious and not as burnt as the breakfast poutine. Overall I would want to come back if I had the chance but in my personal experience, I will never try to breakfast poutine due to that experience."

Even if the food was good, the service was so awful, I'll never go back.We spoke to our waitress twice, once to order and once to pay. We didn't get our full order, mine was missing sirup, my date's was missing her toast. Every time we managed to make eye contact with anyone, they'd turn away, as if they were trying to avoid us. We were able to grab a busboy at some point and asked him for our missing stuff, which we ended up never getting. It was a busy day, but they definitely weren't understaffed (I saw at least 3 waitresses and 2 bussboys).15 minutes later, we were done with our meal, our waitress asked us if everything was good. We told her in the most polite way possible about the missing stuff and the fact that we might have liked to order something else to drink during our meal. What we got as a response was: ""Sorry about that, that'll be $35,63"".I've worked in bars and restaurants, this is not how you treat customers. I don't know about you, but paying for stuff I didn't get is pretty high on the list of things I hate, right under s#itty customer service.One gesture from our waitress would have turned this one star review to a 4 star one with recommendations to all my friends. Oh well."

That is what makes this visit all the more disappointing. Things started off great - we didn't wait long to be seated and I got my OJ right away. Shortly thereafter, we ordered our food. Here's where things went down hill.45 minutes after our order, nothing. We finally flagged down our server to ask what's taking so long, and he said ""Oh, I see your order, I'll be back shortly."" Well guess what, he disappeared for another 10 minutes, at which point we simply gave up and left. I left more than enough money on the table to cover the OJ, but on the way out, nobody asked us anything.Very disappointing and ruined our morning! I highly doubt I'll be back."

I had an omelette with spinach, mushroom and swiss cheese that was mmmhhh ! With that came a little bowl of fruit, some bread toast and sauteed potatoes. I must say it was pretty good & very satisfying, i had a hard time finishing my meal ! The potatoes in my opinion are one of the most delicious items and the friends i went with agreed. Since Fabergé is known for their breakfast poutine, two of my friends ordered those, it looked pretty decadent and a must try for when you are starving !Good service, Good food and charming place!All in all its a good place for brunch, i won't necessarily run back there but if i'm around Mont royal/Laurier neighbourhood i might stop by !"

The sunny side ups we ordered also came out perfect, yolks all shiny and bright. the fries were very good too. The sausages were not good, it tasted weird, and the hollandaise sauce was bland, but the st-paulin cheese is excellent it only we were given a bit more of it to balance out the hollandaise sauce it would be better. If you're going to order eggs benedict go with the ham one, at least the ham is salty so it will balance better.French toast was very soft and nice. All i all, a fine place, but it gets quite loud when it's packed. A bit pricey but all brunch places are pricey now, what is going on?

I came later on in the afternoon, and got to take a tour of their lovely garden, where they grow much of their own herbs, and mint and I thought it was incredible, coz seriously people, when are you going to get more local than in a restaurant. I got to meet the turtle that lives in its own swimming pond too.I've heard that if you are looking for a place to do a private party, they can accommodate you as well!"

The waffle was soggy and tough, the chicken had a nice crust but wasn't salted and was gross dark meat (without the fat trimmed - so why charge $16?!). The ""BBQ sauce"" was unpleasantly bitter and the coleslaw was a miss too (no loss since it was only 2 bites worth in little metal side dish). -1 more star for charging $2 extra for real maple syrup ;( which I later regretted because nothing could have saved the plate! With that said the service was really great and my friend enjoyed her French toast.

It was pretty disorganized when we got there. There was no clear line up or host taking names and when my friend went up to ask an employee what the wait time was like, her answer was ""hard to say..."" She didn't proceed to take our information or offer us any kind of idea of what the plan was. My boyfriend had to go up and request we be put on a waiting list. All this was fine, we were still really excited about sitting down and eating.We were seated and our waitress was really sweet but we quickly realized there was no vegan options. My boyfriend and I aren't vegan, but there is usually one option that can accommodate a particular diet. I understand that veganism is a choice but it's rare that a place really has no alternative dietary options. We asked to sub the eggs on the huevos rancheros with tomatoes which they did but it was so wimpy! There was like a teaspoon of baked beans, a slab of uncooked tomato and some tomatillo sauce. My heart broke for my friend especially since this lame little meal still cost her $14.It was super overpriced and underwhelming. My French toast was only lightly battered on the outside meaning I was pretty much just eating bread and the candied pecans looked like they were from an IGA or something. The chicken and waffles, which my boyfriend ordered, tasted stale. They reminded me of oversized eggos and the fried chicken was overcooked and made with boneless chicken thighs. He couldn't finish them because he found them so gross. For that much money and hype I really expected something more delicious. The only thing that tasted bright and fresh was the fruit side plate. I really wanted to like this place but I for sure won't be going back ever."

Groups crowd outside and inside, hungry diners hope for a cup of joe while they wait. Graffiti like paint adds both wall and table flair - complete with gold! Happy that I didn't have to wait, as I was dining solo, I was swiftly put into an *afterthought* of a table. Wobbly and situated just below the upper level's exposed bench -- complete with an almost-headrest made of jackets swimming over head -- there I was, almost in the flow of traffic, facing a server's prep station. But I didn't really care. I was hungry. The brunch menu is robust! Eggs in ""nests"", steak and eggs, crepes and waffles, benny's, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes. They're all there. I went for the basics 2 eggs with ham, bacon or sausage, served with a fruit bowl, roasted potatoes and toast. There's a smaller and larger version of the same, leaving all appetites appropriately satiated. When my over easy eggs and sausage made it to my table, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed. It was definitely diner style with a steeper price tag. The two sausage links looked like they had been cooked in separate batches: one was blackened on one side and dry. The other was underdone, with not a hint of browning on its skin. The potatoes were missing seasoning. All in all, it was pretty dull. Perhaps I expected too much, and for ambiance, they've got it on a Sunday afternoon. I'd be tempted to test some of their more adventurous dishes - the nests are intriguing, nestled in cheese bread as the menu states."

/user_details?userid=x_HqC7EvD9WWoditWbgkeQ,Alex H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"So, I went to Fabergé last Saturday with my girlfriend, and I was pretty stoked when she suggested it, since we had both hear great things about the place and were eager to try what has been dubbed as one of the best breakfasts in Montreal. It's been six days, almost a full week, and I thought that if I waited to write my review my anger would have surely subsided by now, and I may let up on them just a little. But, I'll be the first to admit that I was wrong. I'm still pissed and really, really confused.I guess I will start from the beginning. We waited in line for about 30-45 minutes, which was just fine with me. I've waited in line for far longer at L'Avenue and I would happily wait in line for a full six hours for the crêpes pommes-cheddar. So waiting less than an hour on a late Saturday morning didn't phase me.When we were seated, I was very impressed with my surroundings. Great decor. Absolutely lovely. I particularly loved the Flava Flav clock on the wall near the kitchen. Looking at the menu, I was impressed with the number of options, and had a difficult time choosing. I am a huge fan of huevos rancheros, and am always eager to try them wherever I go, even though in this city, I'm usually disappointed (side note: for the rancheros of your life, go to Le Gros Jambon). So, naturally, I ordered the rancheros, which were listed under Specialities. Promising, right?Again, I was wrong. When the dish arrived, my heart sank. It LOOKED disappointing. Huevos rancheros is usually a dish with a little height to it, given there are so many components stacked one on top of the other. But if I were to get down at eye level with my plate, I would not have been able to see my food over the edges of the plate.The eggs were cooked to perfection, I'll give them that. But it was all downhill from there. From a bird's eye view, or just the view you get looking down at your plate when it's on the table in front of you, it looked like it was a plain ol' pair of sunny side up eggs placed on top of two corn tortillas, with guac and salsa served on the side. Moving the egg a little, I could see there was indeed some refried black bean and pickled onion sandwiched between the egg and tortilla. There was about enough bean spread to cover my thumb nail (I'm a girl with dainty hands), and no trace of sour cream whatsoever, as advertised on the menu. The ""pickled"" onion tasted as though it had been dipped into vinegar for a nanosecond before tossing it on the plate. There was nothing pickled about that onion.The guacamole was alright. Nothing more than mashed avocado with no trace of seasoning, but I won't complain very much about that, because I could eat an avocado like an apple. The salsa was not verde, not anything close to a salsa verde. They gave me a pitiful corn salsa, which is yellow, by the way, not verde. You don't need to know what yellow means in Spanish, Fabergé, but I think if you're running a restaurant it should be assumed you know what a salsa verde is. Okay, I'll stop ranting about that. Anyway, the corn salsa consisted of dry, wrinkly canned corn, a bit of tomato and a bit of white onion. No seasoning. No cilantro. Not even a trace of lime to give the dish some brightness. The potatoes served with the dish were huge. So big that I needed to quarter them to be able to take a bite out of them. And no, these weren't whole potatoes. Just enormous chunks of under-seasoned starch. I was lucky enough to get a bite out of a nice green bit, which was entirely my fault, since I wasn't paying very much attention to what I was grabbing with my fork. But aside from the near nonexistent black beans, the unpickled pickled onions, the lack of sour cream, the salsa that could be outdone by Old El Paso, and the meteor-sized potatoes, there is one thing about this dish that cannot be forgiven. You see, in any huevos rancheros dish, the corn tortillas are generally lightly fried, or, at the very least, warmed. But Fabergé did not fry their corn tortillas, let alone warm them. They served me straight-from-the-fridge-and-tossed-onto-the-plate corn tortillas. Look. You need to heat your corn tortillas. Not only does it help with pliability, it makes them taste, you know, not like frozen sliced bread. And the worst thing is, I know that I didn't just get a shoddy dish. This is how they MEANT to serve the dish, because I saw a server walk by with the same dish for another person. No difference.Whoever is in the kitchen that is in charge of assembling the huevos rancheros, Google them and learn what they actually are. Or call me. I have a great recipe. At the very least, take them off of your freaking Specialities list. After all this, I can't even get into my girlfriend's breakfast poutine. Not as disappointing, but definitely nothing to feel satisfied with.Skip Fabergé, go almost anywhere else."

The only thing was that they don't serve alcohol out there, so if you want a mimosa opt to sit inside. We wanted to try absolutely everything on the menu and it was so difficult to choose what to get! We finally chose the Chicken and Waffles, with a side of breakfast poutine & the mac and cheese benny with a side of regular poutine. It was delicious. It satisfied our brunch craving for something rich and comforting, but was cooked perfectly - it was not too oily, the flavours were well balanced, overall amazing quality."

We came here with a friend for brunch and sat at a table in their little garden behind the restaurant. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my husband ordered their specialty ""Breakfast Poutine""! The portions were huge and a lot of their veggies are grown in their little garden :) We loved the ambiance of the restaurant, the staff, amazing food and were very happy that our friend introduced us to this really cute place!"

Our toddler was kept entertained by the Bugs Bunny cartoons playing on the two big screens. Pancakes were fluffy; so were the eggs. Probably would have preferred to be asked whether I wanted my croissant sliced and toasted (I didn't), but that's a minor quibble. Definitely worth your time for a good brunch in Mile End."

/user_details?userid=saBwAGVXwSk6kjryIDiNOQ,Matthew A.,"Westbrook, CT",5 star rating,"Traveled here for breakfast with a group of students and we were not disappointed.  The breakfast poutine, with hollandaise as the gravy, was an absurd dish.  It was probably the best and most creative breakfast I've had in the past year.  A friend got the Chicken & Waffles, that was pretty indulgent as well.  The service was warm and wonderful and everyone left happy and full.  Can't wait to return on my next visit to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=1tp9-3xPauVw9kEVt4vDlQ,Bree R.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"The staff was super nice, although when we asked the hostess to sit outside she said she would need to first bus the table and it would screw up her flow.. Haha, wtf? The line to wait wasn't that bad. The place is very cute. Now for the bad: The food. I got the cheesy bread, it tasted like paper. Absolutely no flavor. My girlfriend ordered the salmon Benedict which was also very flavorless. Not sure why everyone keeps saying it's so delicious. I'm an easy going person and wouldn't say it just to say it, the food was not good. It filled me up for sure but I don't enjoy eating just to be full. Very disappointed."

/user_details?userid=1IlAUJUVLAUygMiNvavDxg,Nicholas S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I recently went to this place for the first time on my Birthday (February 14th, 2016) for breakfast/brunch with my sisters. I would advise anyone going, to show up preferably as early as possible to avoid waiting in the long line that files outside the door and onto the sidewalk, it was honestly crazy to see. This place has received A LOT of hype and i'd very much like to set the record straight for any newbies thinking about going there. The place itself is cool, the way its set up. It's quite indicative of a classic Montreal Plateau breakfast hub with its hipster vibe. The service was by far worthy of a five star review. From beginning to end, we felt taken care of, the staff was very friendly, they joked with us about how we didn't eat our fruits, and refilled the waters without us having to even ask. Considering the place was packed, I was extremely impressed by the personalized service. The food however is kind of where this place falls flat. The menu has a fun selection of interesting plates like chicken and waffles, and a fried mac and cheese pulled pork eggs benedict. The problem is that for the above average price your paying combined with the hype surrounding this place, you're expecting this breakfast to be one of the best breakfast's you've ever had, when in reality, although the plates are pretty, the food doesn't taste at all memorable. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict is unfortunately flavourless, not thick enough, and there's just not enough on your plate. I had the El Jeffe sandwich but the guacamole inside also seemed to lack a real kick. All in all this place was a 3.25 stars out of 5. I'll probably go back some day, but there's definitely much better in the area for the same price if you really want an incredibly breakfast experience."
/user_details?userid=O6ThF87h8jz6Jan5RYdwhg,Bridget W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Was super excited to see chicken and waffles on the menu and enthusiastically ordered them along with a breakfast poutine. When the chicken and waffles arrived, I was impressed to see a homemade BBQ sauce and maple syrup on the plate. Unfortunately, the chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it :/ The breakfast poutine on the other hand was fantastic! My stomach hated me for eating something that rich, but the béchamel sauce was so good I ended up wiping the bowl clean with the potatoes from my chicken and waffles plate!"

I had a mushroom eggs benny which was great along with a free latte which I got using the check in. Was pleasantly surprised that drip coffee is always free! Such a nice touch. They also have tvs playing Sunday cartoons which I thoroughly enjoyed. Great service, great food and great coffee."

/user_details?userid=BYpeTH-AMyLWx1615HmC_g,Lauren W.,"Torrance, CA",5 star rating,"I love this place! The first time I went, my parents were in town visiting and they wanted brunch. I had read good reviews about this restaurant on yelp, so we decided to try it. Unfortunately, there was about a 30 minute wait with a line out the door. We decided to stay and try it out since we were already there, even though my dad hates waiting more than 10 minutes at restaurants. The wait staff was very apologetic about the wait (unnecessarily...their food is just too good!) and polite. My dad ordered the chicken and waffles, which turned out to be incredibly delicious, but so much food that we couldn't even help him finish it! My mom and I ordered ham and cheese crepes, which were very good. My husband ordered the special that day, which was a mac n cheese benny. This is where they really hit the nail on the head. They form mac n cheese into cubes, fry them up, and cover them in an egg and hollandaise sauce. I have been back to this restaurant five times since and have tried omelettes, regular bacon and eggs, chicken and waffles, the massive, and huevos locos and I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. However, my favorite thing on the menu has definitely been mac n cheese benny. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, too. My advice--if there's a line, Faberge is absolutely worth the wait!"
