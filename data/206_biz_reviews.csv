I went there on a Monday afternoon at 4:50 PM (10 min before close time).They have a decent seating area if you want to study/work. They are also very well located and parking around isn't impossible to find (park further on Parc). The prices are average for an independent coffeeshop (around 4.50$ a latte)The employee that served me was patient, helped me choose my drink and told me a little bit about the coffeeshop's history, etc. I ordered two lattes, one with soy milk and one normal. Both were exquisite! Can't wait until COVID is over to go study there :)"
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the VERY best coffees in Montreal! Their taste is distinctly unique,  strong and aromatic. The small space inside the cafe along with their bean's aroma creates an exotic and magical vibe. Nothing can beat the feeling of sipping their latte while staring at the snow outside. I was bit sad since it remained closed last 1-2 months because of the pandemic but I checked this morning and it seems they are finally open again for limited hours. I can't wait to grab my favorite latte this week :)"
/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Daniel B.,"Atlanta, GA",3 star rating,"According to Yelp and what I've read on the internet, Pikolo is considered by many, including cafe owners, to be one of the best cafes in Montreal. This place was close to our Airbnb so we stopped by here to grab some coffee on our way to an early lunch at Schwartz's. Pikolo is located in the Milton Park neighborhood of Montreal (a.k.a. the McGill Ghetto), very close to McGill University, downtown Montreal, and the borough of Ville-Marie.Two things stuck out about this place to me:1. There's no Wi-Fi, at least, not during our visit. A couple had just placed their orders and settled in at a table upstairs, with their laptops out and ready to work, when they found out there's no Wi-Fi. Needless to say, they were upset. Annoyed, one of them said words to the effect of, ""Is this place so hipster, they don't feel the need to have Wi-Fi? We should have gone to Starbucks.""While I didn't have a need for Wi-Fi in this instance, I do think all cafes should offer Wi-Fi. It seems pretty standard to me, especially nowadays. I searched Pikolo's Yelp reviews for ""Wi-Fi"" and it looks like Pikolo offered it years ago, but apparently not anymore.2. There's no air conditioning. We visited on a warm day and it was uncomfortably warm/hot inside, especially upstairs.This coffee shop is tiny. I guesstimate there's seating inside for about 25 customers max, mostly at small two-tops. Even if they had Wi-Fi, I don't think this place is conducive for work/study. It's just too small and, when busy, too cramped. Some of the tables are right next to the ordering line. This place is best for a quick meetup or on-the-go coffee/a bite to eat.Criticisms aside, I did like the look and feel of the place. It's got a distinct, throwback, worn-and-weathered, warehouse/loft style to it. My matcha latte ($3.70) was good. It was served hot and unsweetened in a glass. The latte art was beautiful. The quality of the latte and ingredients was very good. My friends got various espresso-based drinks and snacks. Pikolo uses single-origin coffees. Most of their drinks, one size only, ranged in price from $2.61 to $3.70 each. Their coffee (and tea) selection spans the globe from China to England to Ethiopia.There was a small display at the counter with some French and Jewish pastries and artisanal breads from local bakery Hof Kelsten; things like cookies, croissants, muffins, and scones. Pikolo also sells coffee-making products or related accessories like the AeroPress, Hario V60, and reusable KeepCups.Service was fine. Some employees were friendlier than others. We didn't stay long so I had my latte poured into a disposable cup on the way out. I'd come back, but would prefer to check out other coffee shops in Montreal first."
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best coffee shops in the downtown-Mcgill ghetto area. Hidden away on Parc across provigo, this cafe is cute and has its own ambiance. You can sit in, or takeout. I personally like to grab my coffee and walk around the downtown area. Or grab the 80 bus to the plateau/mile-end, coffee in hand. Great boost to start the day.  Usual cafe menu, but the quality is so much better than coffee shop chains or other commercial places. Worth a stop!"

/user_details?userid=1hWFjAmoW3FZ0lmROH5mIA,Vivian W.,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"As an Australian looking for coffee, it can be a little difficult!! This place does its justice through a pikolo latte if you're looking for a similar taste and strength. Perhaps try a smaller size latte (they still have 2 shots so it's essentially a 3/4 full)- however, I drink soy so the added sweetness in the milks here doesn't give me the same taste and strength. I tried a soy latte first but wasn't satisfied so then chose the pikolo. I liked that their place is cosy and very about their coffee! The muffin was really delicious and bonus points for providing vegan options!! Service is lovely! The barista was kind in explaining/offering different options. He accidentally made a regular milk latte due to the computer system mess up but remade a soy one and allowed us to have the milk one anyway for the others in our group!!"
/user_details?userid=uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"This is exactly what I was searching for in a Montreal coffee shop :) Small, quirky, full of local character, and also full of delicious coffee and staffed with talented baristas. We had an espresso, a cappuccino, and a rhubarb and lemon scone, and everything was delicious. I like my coffee strong, and these were. It's such a great spot to grab a few stools and have a nice conversation, read a book, or do some work. Perhaps it's because we came on a rainy Sunday, but there was plenty of space and it didn't feel crowded. They have a super cute little upstairs (loft-style)."
/user_details?userid=cmEkf01xuJ82PUl0mqkfTQ,Ginger G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4 star rating,"Visiting from the U.S. and wanted a quality coffee. Yelp pointed me in the right direction and I ordered a Pikolo Latte (made with almond milk, per my request). The flavor was intense as the cup is smaller than a regular latte. I arrived close to closing, so no chance to order a pastry. Might have to go back for one of those!Edit: a guy came in after me looking for a drip brew and since it was so close to the end of the night, he got it for free! Nice customer service."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I feel lucky that Pikolo is right in my backyard. This coffee shop has tons of charm, and is a favorite of many, not only in the neighbourhood, but also in town. Prices aren't cheap and sizes can seem rather small, but the quality is there. They used to have recurrent problems with their coffee machine last summer (something was leaking, I think), which is why we stopped going there for awhile, but the troubles have since gone away. They also used to have the yummiest zucchini/goat cheese muffin - they had less than a dozen at a time, and it was a rush against time to buy some before they were sold out. Apart from coffee, they also offer a variety of other products. I've bought beans from Pikolo (49th parallel, Phil and Sebastian), even a bag of decaf to trick my boyfriend (""It's weird, I feel tired""). I even got a V60 dripper from Hario to experiment with Japanese pour-over iced coffee. Pikolo is a place that brings inspiration (or repels procrastination) to many essay-minded Arts students. For me, it's more of an occasional treat than anything else."
/user_details?userid=7BypYgbi8ur5jRQMsRcMHQ,Jil M.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Fabulous espresso (I got both the cortado and the house latte -- which as explained is tiny but delicious -- and both were wonderful) and a great little selection of pastries. Came across them while searching for a Saturday morning pick-me-up and we returned multiple times during our stay in Montreal -- even with staying at a hotel that served free, great espresso drinks itself. Service was lovely during all of our visits, and the shop was a quaint and cozy escape from the chilly winter temps. I'll definitely be back!"

Really tiny lol do not come here with a large group.I've had lattes and cappuccinos and they're so smooth and not bitter at all. The price is alright but for quality espresso I can't complain.

It has an intentional ""worn-in and cozy"" feeling. We ordered a superb latte and cappuccino - the latte in particular was impressive as it can be a fail in many shops. Here it still manages to be rich and robust - reminded us of Europe. Croissants are fantastic! Buttery and crispy, with a light chewy Center.  If you're in the neighbourhood this is a great place to stop."

/user_details?userid=Zd3wzNdevk15CwMIJdbjZw,Diana S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely fits the bill of hipster coffee. They use 49th Parallel (Vancouver) beans. Here's a review from someone who knows very little about hipster coffee. All I can say is that the flat white made with soy milk was small with a perfect amount of froth. I liked that the non-dairy milks were not overly sweet as they tend to be at larger franchises, such as Second Cup, Starbucks, etc. Unfortunately there were no vegan baked goods. There is also limited seating as customers with laptops come and stay forever."

/user_details?userid=km3lnJeuDtQrtKxyU1Dwfg,Trevor T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love coffee, and this is certainly one of the best cafes in the Milton/Parc area. I come here often: I've had their americano, espresso, cappucino, and their latte. Everything is amazing. Granted, I've never had their pastries, but they do look pretty yummy.They make their coffee products with coffee from Phil and Sebastian coffee roasters, which is a premiere coffee roaster from Calgary. Their service is quick and amiable every time, and I would not hesitate to recommend this spot for some good coffee. It's quite cozy inside, and it could (arguably) use more space, but there are two floors if the first floor is full. They also sell bags of coffee, from roasters like 49th Parallel (out of Vancouver), Cut Coffee Roasters (out of Toronto) and of course, Phil and Sebastian. Great place!"
/user_details?userid=UfEGFmnTJHRUaYubvKWx6A,Axel N.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Heard a lot of great reviews for this place, so I decided to give it a try.Worst $5 I've spent in a while. From the moment I walked in I knew I was in for a disappointment. The baristas had the typical couldn't-care-less attitude for both the drinks and the service. Very unpleasant demeanors on both their faces.Second, to pay $5.50 for a very small almond milk latte? Ridiculous! The espresso was not of raving quality, and to top it all off, I found a very appetizing plastic fiber in one of my first sips. Yummy. I have no idea why this place is continuously boasted as one of the best coffee shops in Montreal. It is far from that. I highly recommend trying any of the other top spots for better coffee."
/user_details?userid=6q_GsTZQ5LOHRDY7UxjcpA,Sean F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"This shop was right down the street from our Airbnb, and I couldn't be more grateful. I'm not necessarily a coffee snob, but I do make it a point to try a different coffee shop every day when I'm on vacation, and after a 5 day trip to Montreal, this was my favorite. I tried both the latte and the cold brew and both were great. The cold brew was particularly on point--flavorful and strong, but never bitter. It's crazy how challenging it is to find a cold brew with those characteristics.I'm docking the one star, though, because the customer service wasn't all that great. I'm sure that part of it was that we were American, but I noticed on more than one occasion a lack patience (*not* hostility) toward people who didn't speak French. Altogether, great, great coffee."

/user_details?userid=EuZ-tHEbL6YQ3juY_EsT2Q,Aixin L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Great little cozy cafe that we came across during our stay in Montreal. Made for a pleasant stop for a short coffee break and a quick bite. The cappuccino and latte were both very aromatizing and quite strong. The cappuccino was more bitter than how I usually like it cuz I'm a pansy when it comes to coffee, but it brings out the aroma when it's not drowned in sugar, I suppose. We tried the cranberry scone. It was super buttery and not overly sweet. Loved it. The spinach / cheese pastry was also a great snack to grab and go - fresh and crispy."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,Coffee is rich and nutty flavored which I love. Had a cappuccino and it was great! Funny how they use the same coffee as some very popular coffee shops but the flavor is so much more different...definitely has to do with the way they brew their coffee.Beware...There is no A during summer so I was sweating my life out as I tried to enjoy my delicious coffee.
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"To be honest, after stopping by Pikolo numerous times during the summer and sometimes during the fall semester for a quick caffeine boost, I still fail to see the hype surrounding this place. Sure, it does have coffee and tea beverages within close proximity to campus, but it's nothing to rave about. They do use 49th Parallel coffee though, which I find to be a bit too acidic for my liking, so maybe that's the case.This time, I ordered the mocha and a cranberry banana muffin, and, as said before, I found the mocha quite acidic. In addition, I felt as though the chocolate flavor didn't really come through and as a result was missing. Also, as a coffee shop muffin aficionado, I found Pikolo's to be a bit on the drier side, and the flavors of the fruit components seemed to be quite muted in comparison with other muffins I've had. Overall, I'll probably just stick to Nocturne (previously Kitsuné) to get my daily coffee fix. Also, they have a rotating selection of muffins on the daily which cater to specific diets, but they're universally delicious! I just might be spoiled too much by coffee shops more deep into the Plateau, I guess..."

Latte was well made and served in a glass cup.  Chocolate croissant was very good - not the best, but still crispy outside with melty chocolate inside.  Pikolo comes up under a 'brunch' search on Yelp.  This is more of a coffee spot."
/user_details?userid=sUVnFREGnpVlsRtgje0n5w,Martha C.,"West Allis, WI",5 star rating,Pikolo is a such a cute place with a really cozy atmosphere. I ordered an herbal tea which was good and my friend got an incredible mocha. This place fills up pretty quickly. Definitely not a place to come with a group of friends. Better for individuals or 2 people together. The only negative is that they don't have Wifi.

/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"Small cafe serving up fresh and delicious roasted coffee. I believe by the taste that they are using 49th parallel which I find is a lighter and somewhat more delicate roast than a dark Italian roast. None the less it's deliciously tasty. I ordered a cappuccino and It was creamy frothy coffee delight. The vibe of a coffee shop is key to their brand experience. Here at Pikolo there was a good steady stream of young urban, local and student feel to the place. It's location may make you double park or have a bit of trouble if you come by car. However if the line is not long it's worth the quick double park as its a pleasant indie coffee house experience."
/user_details?userid=gjCdbWBuk2POC-9dunIWoA,Caroline L.,"Tysons Corner, VA",5 star rating,Stayed in Montreal for 5 days and one of the biggest regrets was not hitting up Pikolo in the beginning of the trip. My bff is one of the biggest latte lovers and we both agreed PIkolo had one of the best lattes we've ever had. I'm obsessed over iced americanos (which was good here) but almost wanted to order a latte too after I tasted hers. Not sure what more I can say. Oh yes it was also sort of a warm day and they didn't have a/c on and we were sweating a bit ordering but we found this to be true of many establishments. I can't imagine how delicious a hot espresso beverage would be in the winter.
/user_details?userid=Gkxe9U9E2WR2937cjIZboA,Jason K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"How anyone could give this place less than 5 stars eludes me. This is probably the best mocha in town. I don't like sugar coffee drinks but this mocha is out of this world. They actually have a molten batch of melted chocolate that goes right into the coffee!!! It's crazy!!! Their cold brew is great, and same as the filtered coffee. The desserts here are pretty good too!! I like the pecan tarts. Highly recommended! These guys understand coffee and cafe culture, they deliver a product that is above and beyond. If you can appreciate a quality cup of coffee, you owe it to yourself to try this place.I gave this place 5 stars because I do not think there is any room for any improvements."
/user_details?userid=tAtblebDRTiB9TkAxupncQ,Ivan M.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"One of my favourite coffee places in the city, but with one fatal flaw; my order is rarely correct.I've been here about twenty times and more than three quarters of the time my order, which is always a decaf soy latte, ends up either not soy, or not decaf. It's never both wrong, but it does get a little frustrating to always have to double check your order."

/user_details?userid=77mrdKtIPkQ2ciBYUCxNyg,Wei J.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,This review is based on the soy cappuccino that I got here. This was a rather eye opening experience for me. Literally. This strong pull of espresso jolts you awake from the very first sip and leaves a tantalizingly bold but not bitter aftertaste that just awakens the senses with every subsequent bit imbibed until the very last drop. The coffee was made to perfection.It's definitely the best cup I've had to date this year.
/user_details?userid=VulY9izUJG_reE4SqvCOYw,Winny K.,"Malden, MA",4 star rating,"We dropped by this cafe as our last destination before leaving Canada. Pikolo offers exceptional coffee, though the space itself is quite small. The baristas here remind you that coffee is to be enjoyed as they meticulously make each cup of coffee. T and I were in awe as one of the baristas pulled out a scale and timer for a pour over coffee, plus the little kettle. She spent a solid 5-8 minutes making that one cup as we sipped on our lattes. The flavor for both our normal and Pikolo latte was nutty and chocolatey, with no bitterness whatsoever. I recommend this place for no frill, barebone coffee, but don't expect an internet cafe bustling with millennial (like a Starbucks)."

My first time ever tried Gibraltar which is a double shot of espresso with just a touch of milk. The drink was strong and really gave me the boost I needed! The cappuccino was strong but yet mellowed by the nicely foamed milk.Pikolo has this really laid back vibe. Free wifi and tons of outlets.

I've come here for take out coffee, to sit in and chat, and also to work on my studies with some food and coffee. Though there is a second floor, the cafe can be quite cramped because it is narrow and kinda small, so it can be really hard to find space to sit at. The coffee for my taste is quite acidic, so if you get sick from too much caffeine or acidity, try their tea selection. Aside from the drinks, their food is quite good as well!"

Had their bacon, Swiss, and mushroom scone which was tasty but probably tastes much better warmed (which wasn't an option). The latte was good but nothing I would go out of my way for. It was served in a glass.  This is fine and I enjoyed seeing the layers of my latte.  Here, however, they need to invest in thicker glasses... I could barely hold the glass and I'm one of those that doesn't routinely use sleeves with my coffee (to give you perspective).  Atmosphere wise.... The music (80s American) was at a good volume to encourage chatting and the decor matched a typical small coffee shop.  The staff all spoke French and English and while okay, we're not overly friendly. Not much seating, but sufficient for a space of this size. It was stuffy however... The only ventilation offered by two fans a ways away on a very high ceiling.By far the worst thing, however, was that they didn't offer wifi. A cafe this close to a nationally recognized university in 2015 and the wifi is locked?  They had it, just didn't offer it to their patrons.  Seriously?  Even the public bus from the airport had wifi! All in all, an okay place to stop for a coffee and quick snack if it's on the way, but don't go out of your way to get here. (BTW... Now I sit some doors down at a Starbucks that I went to so that I could post this review using their FREE WIFI, okayed by the really friendly staff, while sitting in a nicely ventilated space, listening to non-American music ... go figure!"

We were in there pretty early on a weekday morning and found the usual collegiate collection of men in blazers, hipsters, and bearded wonders.The coffee was indeed good, as was the croissant I ordered.

I stop by almost daily for a latte, cappuccino, americano or filtered coffee. Types of coffee beans are changed daily and keep me from getting bored of the same flavors. The vibe is cozy and welcoming, and customers are loyal. Can get busy at times, but quality of drinks, food and service is never compromised. Prices on the board are reasonably prices and include tax, so no surprises there. I'm slightly disappointed they no longer offer their loyalty card, a free cup after every 9; but, coffee is too good to question another cafe. You can't go wrong with any of their drinks and if you see cookies on the counter, splurge, don't even think about splitting with a friend. You won't regret coming to Pikolo!"

There's not a whole lot of room here to sprawl out and set up an all-day workspace (you know who you are), but for a hole in the wall it has good light and charming atmosphere. If you don't see a spot at first, check upstairs, where there are a few extra tables that you might not notice upon first glance. The coffee is nice. The baristas know their stuff, and the result is beautifully foamed milk and espresso pulled just to your liking. They also have a delicious cold brew, which seems to be something of a specialty item around here. The blueberry-lemon scone had just the right mix of crumbly, squishy, tart and sweet. I'll be back."

Came here with my sister and we both had lattés and mama mia -so perfect! Smooth,rich and silky texture of the espresso complemented with a good 2/3 milk ratio. The milk was skillfully steamed and you could taste the quality of the product, the freshness played largely into its natural sweetness. I also thought the temperature of the drink was superbly accurate (atleast for me). Sometimes I find the espresso bars in Montreal serving coffee that is not warm enough, I know that seaming milk too much can burn it so it's hard to get that foam and froth within ~60° but too often the coffee here gets cold before I'm done drinking half of it. Pikolo's temperature was en pointe -warm enough for the duration of a good conversation but not so warm that it got bitter. Just be careful when holding the glass mugs!"

/user_details?userid=qe_Yiq-Gm60TA9cK0VfbiA,Nina N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Cozy little café near McGill University serving coffee roasted in small batches from two collaborators, one in Calgary and the other one in Portland (Oregon). Quality is consistent, without a doubt, despite the small scale production. Apart from the regular types of coffee beverages that are offered, the Pikolo latté is one of my favourite orders whenever I'm in town and I'm in a rush. In a nutshell, the Pikolo latté is a small-sized latté served in a glass a little bigger than a shot glass. Coffee extraction is done a little more concentrated so the coffee taste is more pronounced, which makes this baby latté more reminiscent of a creamy espresso than a latté. Coffee is the main reason to drop by Pikolo (the café owner trained in Australia for several months), but pastries are also worth a bite: either all made in store or bought from local Montréal bakeries, products are definitely ethical and fresh. Since I don't have a sweet tooth, I usually grab the granola that's freshly made every morning for a couple of bucks.For students who are looking for a study spot: the relaxed, casual atmosphere makes it really tempting to stay and study, but since it's a small café, tables are stools are rare to come by.Bonus points: last time I was at Pikolo, a barista was wearing a 49th Parallel T-shirt!"

I think they bake everything on the spot even several times a day(of course they should). The only thing you need to keep in mind is that they only accept cash or debit(from Canadian Banks) and that their wireless connection is not very strong.

Where it once stood out as my very favourite in Montreal,I would now rank it in a group of top picks with Myriade, Couteau, Flocon, Dispatch, Pourquoi Pas, and Différance: a jewel in a rich coffee scene.Pikolo has become a leaner operation this year. There is no more wifi, no self-service water dispenser, and no oven. (Fear not, the same assortment of scones etc. is still here.) The loyalty program is no more, although old cards are still stamped and honoured. Some table space has made way for new shelves of beans for sale. The hours are a bit shorter -- later mornings, earlier evenings. The most striking difference may be due to the wifi cut: for the first time I can remember, Pikolo is kind of peaceful and no longer like an annex of the McGill library, with screens and tapping keyboards aplenty. Turnover is faster, and there are usually tons of empty seats (a bit jarring for what was a constantly packed café).

Marie-Eve and her staff are incredibly kind and craft lovely experiences for new and old customers alike. When this place first opened, it didn't experience too much traffic (which made it a great study spot for McGillians and Concordia students as well as an awesome place to chat for locals). As the word got out about how great their espressos are, it has become more of a transient place to enjoy a cup of java and go on with your day. I sort of enjoy that it has evolved into the latter, as it allows all customers to enjoy the ambiance of the two-floor cafe as well as their beverages and freshly-baked goods. If you're super keen on studying or reading, you better get a spot in the early AM (the closer to 7, the better).If you know your day is going to be shitty, stressful, or unexciting, the best way to rectify that is by immediately popping into this intimate spot on Parc ave and treat yourself to a latte or a macchiato. If you're having a great day, it definitely doesn't hurt to celebrate by having a piece of the banana-chocolate bread with a cold brew in the summer!"

I have to say, I enjoy my latte and cold pressed coffee more than what I make at home, but I guess that just keeps me coming back. The scones are literally the best scones I've ever had- they change them daily. The most memorable one I had was with sweet potato, walnuts, and some type of cheese. It was incredible.

You get sour coffee when either the beans are sour or the brew was too hot, but neither was the case here. The espresso tastes more like it would in Italy, with depth and identity, not like what you might get from most café chains, where they might mask bland beans with sugar and chocolate."

The coffee aromas are one of the first things you notice when you enter the building and i was very impressed by their brewing machines. They have intimate seating areas made for 2-3 people no more and offer a excellent mezzanine where you feel on top of the world. Its a great spot to sonder or to divide yourself from the hustle and bustle of the main floor. The coffee itself was of excellent quality however the cups they give it in are glass and i know they are trying to be different but i found trying to carry two hot glasses up to the mezzanine quite difficult. I think some nice stylish mugs or glasses with handles would not go astray.  For that i give it a 4. To summarize, magnificent coffee, chilled vibes, great place."

I've tried their lemon poppy seed bread and that thing I gotta say is dense and pack full of flavour.

The greatness at Pikolo starts with the owner who is REAL coffee person; meaning she goes to great lengths to ensure the integrity of the people, equipment, processes, and ingredients to provide a consistent level of excellence that is lacking in soooooo many places we carelessly slap with the label of greatness due to having been randomly blessed by the ""Hit"" portion of the hit or miss equation.  Superb, freshly roasted beans are always on hand with a generous assortment available for take home as well.  Baked goods are also top class with vegan and gluten free offerings typically on the menu.  All of this goodness is delivered in a very laid-back environment without the double-shots of hipster pretentiousness that can (and do) spoil some of the other great coffee houses in the city (and everywhere)  Convenient to the hotels on Sherbrooke if you're a tourist / business visitor.  If you're a student and haven't found this place then you should just give up and go to school in another city."

The coffee everywhere else wasn't necessarily bad, but I work for Mocha Joe's in Vermont, so I get to drink great coffee everyday.Pikolo was serving Phil & Sebastian and Heart coffee roasters, which is definitely good stuff, up there with Intelligentsia or Terroir. The espresso shots were single origin and we had Ethiopian Yurko. It was really bright up front and faded into a sort of cocoa as a finish. In my opinion the espresso isn't sour, it's acidic and when it comes to specialty coffee, that's a desirable characteristic. They also have a super nice Mirage espresso machine, weigh out the ground coffee for each shot and used naked portafilters so they (and you if you want to) can see the pour.The drip coffee was Guatemala La Esperanza. The only thing they didn't have that I wanted was a larger cup, they only serve one size for to go cups which I think was 12oz. That's usually what I drink but as we headed out of Montreal, I really wanted a larger cup for the road.The Barista's were super friendly, knowledgeable and happy to chat with me about coffee for a couple of minutes. We also tried a variety of their muffins and they are totally worth getting if you want a light snack or breakfast. Overall, awesome place that you should definitely check out if you love coffee as much as I do."

/user_details?userid=GERRIWMslcP4-O6mLErPSQ,Melissa F.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this place a thousand times over.  Some of the 5 star reviews will tell you why it's perfect.I will tell you WHY this has a few bad reviews:Their espresso is VERY strong and very bitter.  This is not a bad thing on their part- but up to personal preference.  This espresso is made to be put in milk based drinks and is best in milk based drinks like lattes, cappuccinos.  If you MUST try the espresso on it's own do NOT get allonge.  Allonge means ""long""- which is a long pull and will make the already-bitter espresso- more bitter!  In Montreal people tend to drink their espresso allonge- which is actually pretty rare to find in the best coffee houses.  So if you are going to go the espresso route as expressly for a short ""ristretto"" pull OR get the macchiato or a dry cappuccino- that way some milk is incorporated and it will ease the bitterness of the espresso.(This place is also VERY anglo- being in McGill ghetto.  Some cafes with nicer espresso will not be so nice if you are Anglo- here there is no attitude, just good coffee)."

I always order their cappuccino, it is so good that it has changed my life and my expectations. It is the real deal. Moreover, the little designs that they so perfectly draw over your espresso absolutely blows my mind.

First, the positives. Mind-numbingly fresh and flaky croissant, perky and attentive help, hip and modern atmosphere, reasonable prices, and perfect location made this coffee bar a great choice.Unfortunately, the espresso is following the trend of so many hip, new wave, trendy coffee bars across North America, they're sour. Insanely and inappropriately sour. So much attention and detail is put into producing what is an overly sour shot. Either the coffee is too fresh or the temperatures are too low at the beginning of the pull, but it's just not the way espresso should be. Smoothed out by milk, the coffee stands up well, but as a single straight shot, not so much.If the espresso hadn't been a sour acid bomb, I would have easily given this place five stars."

I gather from the other reviews that the owner spent time in Australia, so it's all starting to make sense now.All the pastries look great. I've tried the chocolate blueberry scone and will get it again next time I see it - they seem to vary daily, and most of them look made on site.The ambience is nice.

/user_details?userid=QTCCx80LyWrRC2AYRCrVcA,Ben P.,"Memphis, TN",2 star rating,"Walked a mile and a half in pouring rain from my hostel to get what looked to be the best coffee in the area (according to Yelp). Well, this ain't it. Or, at least, I hope it's not.I agree with every other assessment of the sourness. My first drink, a macchiato, was just straight up face-puckering. My second, a cold brew, was more palatable due to the ice watering and mellowing the brew a bit, but still definitely with the sour. Finally, I decided I'd just get a cup of the house coffee, and man, once the temp went into lukewarm territory, I couldn't finish it.It's a shame, because the space is great. The music, while I was there, was eclectic and not overbearing. The staff was helpful and friendly... just, wow, terrible tasting coffee.For the record, I've found this to hold true: if the beans on display are lighter and look to be dry, not oily, then you can bet on the brew being this type of sour/bitter."

They make your drink of choice with grace and love. This is serious artisanal coffee! My drink of choice is the Cortado or the Gibraltar (that is their moniker of choice for this particular drink at Pikolo) and it is excellent! Their blueberry scone is the best scone I've had outside of the U.K. but they go fast. Seriously, their scones are gone by like eleven o'clock... The early bird seriously gets the scone. Also their seasonal house fruit compote, granola and yoghourt parfait is sumptuous. Go here before, after or in between classes because it's a quick hop, skip and a jump away from McGill. Sit down, relax, read a book, study or daydream and let the world pass you by. If you're lucky you'll get a spot upstairs to set up shop and really enjoy your coffeehouse experience. Atop your regal perch you'll be able to survey your domain, pontificate over coffee and meditate on the universe. If you can't sit upstairs you should stay and sit downstairs and be in the mix.

/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The SpotTo people for whom Parc Ave is the street used to rush downtown and back, Pikolo's the best coffee shop they never notice. It's narrow and deep, nestled between a stationary shop and first date staple Pullman. Through most of the winter, you can't even see inside because the windows are steamy from how warm the people, croissants and coffee are behind 'em.But to people who think of Parc Ave as Montreal's heart and soul, Pikolo's the best coffee shop, period. The café balances an industrial look with earthy colours, its heavy wooden chairs and tables laid out under a high ceiling from which metal lamps and soft light bulbs hang. It's high-style coziness, and it's got us coming back for more.What's Really Good? Let's put it plainly: you'd be tough pressed finding better coffee anywhere in Montreal.""Passion"" seems too generic a word to describe owner Marie-Ève Laroche's commitment to coffee. Talk to her for a minute or two and you'll come to realize she hasn't only set out to serve first-class coffee but also to educate customers as to where it comes from, how it's best prepared, what to look out for in its taste. Watching the equally-dedicated baristas at work is watching scientists in a laboratory, controlling grams of coffee, milliliters of water, extraction times, temperatures. It's the kind of stuff that turns casual coffee lovers into aficionados.Not typically does one know the first thing about those metrics either. All we know is that when you taste the coffee, they start making a lot of sense. The house specialty is the Pikolo latte (pictured), in case you're undecided, though for what it's worth we'd add that the director of quality control, Mitchell, also makes the best Americano in town.All this knowledge and Marie-Ève's experience working on various coffee plantations extend to the source of what is served, of course. Pikolo collaborates with Canadian microroaster Phil & Sebastian and the Portland-based Heart, two roasters keen on quality, detail, and green coffee. And it's not just the coffee, either: we're also talking homemade, oven-hot butter croissants, raspberry-cranberry muffins, sugar-cinnamon waffles, chocolate fondants ...You'll Wanna KnowIt's a small space, so if you're looking for a coffee house to spend your Sunday working on a final paper, get ready to peel your eyes to find a spot. You'll usually be able to find one within minutes, but it gets a little tricky when you're not on your own.Cash or debit ($5 minimum) only."

Everything happened so fast that I didn't even see the grind, dose, tamp, and pull, so I'm not sure if something else could've been a problem.To their credit though, was that even in all its sourness, I could taste that the beans they used was amazing. Tons of character. They also have a great selection of direct trade beans.Other than that, the decor was cool, and the atmosphere was amazing.

/user_details?userid=schfOYW71VamTTdfzqDlXQ,Shane L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Easily top 10 in MTL.  Everything about this place screams awesomeness!  The only issue is seating but it kind of adds to it's value... Something about the law of scarcity I believe.

/user_details?userid=_dC3wEoq02Op4lCyzYXSZg,Ato B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,One of the best espresso bars in Montreal. Coffee is high quality and the baristas are very professional. Internet is reliable.
/user_details?userid=GPBHqc0C5a7SW1jmRThVNA,Jack B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Pikolo is a great alternative to the corporate coffee chains you find on Park Avenue. I often make a detour to go take an espresso there - it tastes amazing, a little sour like it's custom in Northern Italy. The only problem is that, well, the coffee shop is indeed small. I often need to consume my espresso standing. But I guess an always full coffee shop is better than an empty one.Continue your great job."

/user_details?userid=5057MV2nvwI8r-nIpZj8uw,Angela M.,"Halifax County, Canada",4 star rating,This is my favourite cafe in the city. It's a cozy spot with a great relaxed vibe and awesome decor. Staff is really warm and welcoming. The coffee and espresso is fantastic. What more could you ask for? :)
/user_details?userid=xQC-G-9bxyXEsy-GQ-UTEw,Stephen R.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"I had discovered this place online before coming to Montreal and it was also recommended to me by a friend. Needless to say, I was excited to try the coffee at Pikolo! In the end, I was a bit disappointed. My macchiato was alright, though did not live up to the hype. Good for a coffee if you're in the area, though not worth a special trip."

I'm from Vancouver and am always searching for the ultimate coffee place while I am traveling and Pikolo hit the mark for me. Exceptional espresso, fresh baked muffins, and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend Pikolo to all my coffee snob friends."

/user_details?userid=yHakD_sjdUAzLQWLslmUfg,Rachel L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"For the week that I am staying in Montreal, this is my local coffee shop and I feel that I really lucked out. It's also the only place of its kind in the area as far as I could tell. The coffee is stellar, the vibe is cool, the pastries are delicious, and it's conveniently located up the street from the metro. The staff is friendly, bilingual, and has great taste in music. This place is a total win in my book."
/user_details?userid=huHOgjAAeUr6zoV-dcbI9Q,David K.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,Sets the bar for bad service. Drinks forgotten and then wrong ones hastily delivered. Barista busy swatting flies and doesn't wash hands before going back to the espresso machine. More lost points for playing generic euro synth dance music. A bummer because try stock really good coffees and seem very popular.
/user_details?userid=Xbd8Ju3n6SvdhC5_8ZgaKQ,Andrew H.,"Allston-Brighton, MA",5 star rating,"My fiance and I visited Montreal for 4 days.  We scoured the city for decent coffee.  We tried Presse cafe, and I asked for an iced latte, I was given some sort of frozen icee coffee garbage.  I don't even know what it was supposed to be.  I was so disappointed.  So we turned to yelp to help us find a third wave shop.  We were considering trying the second cup when we walked by a few times and then figured out it was a local chain, but never got there since we found Pikolo.  Pikolo should be called the first cup...It is the only good coffee in Montreal you need to try.  Don't waste your time anywhere else.  Once you stop here, you won't need any other cafe.  Ever changing espresso choices.  The day we were there they had one espresso offering in the morning and by the afternoon (we had to go back for more after hiking up Montreal) they had another espresso offering.The staff was friendly and knew what they were doing.If you like a cafe that knows how to pull a smooth espresso then this is the place for you."
/user_details?userid=ZvgzyvB8tYGoSkOVhWSWTA,Brent F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Really great coffee bar serving coffee from some of the best roasters in North America (Phil & Sebastian - Calgary and Heart - Portland on the day I visited).  Their granola and yogurt was just what I needed, and the coffee was pulled by a good looking barista who really knew what he was doing.  Loved the look and feel of the space. If I lived in Montreal I would def hang out here."
/user_details?userid=a1vsz4jXTMHrNI-rfxZmSQ,Joseph S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After all the hype, really quite overrated. I wouldn't call the espresso ""exceptional"" in any way. Not bad, but nothing special either.  What is it with Mtl and sour espresso? Pastries I've tried have been pretty good. Nice ambiance, though a bit crowded. Rent is cheap in this city, you couldn't find more space?  Other reviewers are raving about the place as a destination for hanging out, but it's rare that you'll be able to actually find a seat and work, especially if you have more than 2 members in your party.  Staff is friendly but not really exceptional.  Perfectly acceptable, but certainly not the best in Mtl.  Keep looking guys."
/user_details?userid=LjQmSfy9BfWr4WBL7dK8ow,K A.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I stumbled across Pikolo - open just three weeks - while she was looking for great coffee in Montreal.  She wasn't disappointed.  I'm not a coffee fan, but Daniela - a coffee snob - sighed in happiness at her first sip, and I thoroughly enjoyed the chai tea latte I had.  The chocolate banana bread was spectacular and spicy (with cloves, all spice, and nutmeg), and is baked by proprietor Marie-Eve herself.  Marie-Eve is super friendly and cut her teeth on third-wave coffee in Australia.  She's incredibly passionate about coffee and Pikolo feels cool and friendly without being pretentious.  The space is beautiful, with high ceilings, dark wood, tons of light, and metal fixtures.  Really a great place to get some work done, sip a delicious hot bevvy, or write a yelp review ;) If we lived this wonderful city, this would be my go-to coffee shop. I have no doubt Pikolo is going to be a fixture of the Montreal coffee shop scene for a long time."
/user_details?userid=INyWEIyIYH1svRQSMmzY5g,Peter S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"If you like good coffee, this is not the place to go. If you like hipster looking coffees hops, but do not care about the taste of your coffee, it is a nice place. Went there twice and had an americano and both times the coffee was sour. Maybe it is ok if you put a lot of cream and sirup, but the coffee itself is below par."
/user_details?userid=9bZnTLM9G1XW4BubaxESsQ,Kay C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I tried an Americano, and I found it too sweet. My BF really enjoyed his, but the particular beans they use are not pleasing to my palate. I've experienced this with many high rated coffee shops, and end up disappointed.We also tried a lemon poppy seed scone and a croissant. Both were quite tasty!The staff are very friendly, and the decor is awesome. I just wish the coffee tasted stronger and fuller."
/user_details?userid=-BW3vpjG_RDxdlFs7xneOg,Diana Y.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"got a cappuccino on a rainy weekend and the flavor was slightly bitter, but not bad. the small cafe reminds me of so many in nyc except that it was not jam-packed. on the other hand, i am not sure this is all that great of coffee place. my friend and i drank our drinks but perhaps it is that we are used to a lot better (blue bottle, joes, etc. in nyc?). not bad, but nothing to write home about. would i order a drink again? sure, after all, caffeine is necessary to pump into my blood stream."

What is special about Pikolo is the fact that the ambience feels like you stepped into NYC. A quiet, dreamy NY that is. The coffee is great and what is even more exciting is that they take and make their coffee seriously! If you enjoy Cafe Myriade, Saint Henri Micro-Torrifactor then you will not be disappointed! I can pretty much guarantee this!."

/user_details?userid=_HiBUu4EF6JD7x264d_E_A,Mike F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great coffee, atmosphere, and baked goods in this little place. If you are in the McGill area this is the best coffee there is. However this place doesn't stack up to the big boys in town like Cafe Olympico. Lattes have been inconsistent, the place can get filled with dirty dishes, and it lacks proper airflow. I gave it 4/5 because it is the best in the neighborhood but it can be better if it worked out some of these problems. A good addition to Montreal's coffee scene."
