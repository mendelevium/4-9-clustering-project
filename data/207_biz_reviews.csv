Noticed that, on a menu at the side, it was listed as having shrimp. I'm allergic, so I asked if I could swap it out for something that didn't have shrimp. They checked, and said the pork dumpling (siu mai) was fine, so I ordered that. When it came, I bit into it, only to find... an entire shrimp. Had to throw it away. :("
/user_details?userid=SjgDlQXD4611svaP7fYrQA,Ann N.,"Galveston, TX",2 star rating,"Come for the photos, not for the taste or service! This place is the cutest bakery at the corner of the street of Chinatown. Upon coming in, it's split into 2 sections: a bread bakery on the left & steamed buns/dim sum/smoothie selection on the right. The cases are filled with some of the cutest steamed buns I've seen. If you love Sanrio (Japanese cartoon characters) like Hello Kitty, Kero Kero Kerroppi, Doraemon, etc. this is the place for you. They also have panda, pig, angry bird, and various animal shaped steamed buns for you to select from and enjoy.I chose the matcha bun & blueberry bun both with red bean paste. They're both so much more dough than filling. They're served warm to you in paper bags, but the more I kept biting hoping for filling, is just get more dough. You'll also have to pay 25 cents to get a box. Buns vary from $2-2.50. Service was pretty rude. I'd only get these buns once for the photo, but after your pictures are taken, go somewhere else for a more worthwhile snack."

OMG, this place has steamed buns in cute characters! Love Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty and Doraemon? You can find them here. Want a panda steamed bun? Yep, you can get a dozen if you wanted to. The cute character steamed buns range from $2 to $2.50. You can also get regular steamed buns that range between $2 and $3.50. This place accepts debit and cash only.I was mesmerized by how creative this bakery is. As much as I would have liked to have bought one of each, I settled for the chick (mango coconut filling) and the bunny (green tea paste filling). They were adorable.I had the bunny steamed bun when I got back to my hotel room. The downside is that you get far more dough than filling. It was good.For breakfast, I changed things up and had the chick steamed bun. It was yummy. I loved it better than the bunny. I simply love coconut and pineapple. Again, you get more dough than filling.This place also has egg waffles. I was watching a woman brush oil in each egg crater of her waffle maker. It seemed so laborious. Then again, the lineup was so long waiting to get my steamed buns that it was fascinating watching her do it.You can also order dim sum items to either eat in the place or do takeout. I had already eaten dinner and wanted these steamed buns more, so I passed.This bakery offers unique creations. I wish we had a bakery like this bakery in the GTA. I loved my visit here.(320)"

The place is smack in the middle of Chinatown next to another pastry place that's worth checking out as well. Each bao were super cute and huge! The best one is probably the black sesame panda. They have you a good amount of black sesame inside. The blue berry red bean doraemon is the best in terms of the outside bread. It is sweeter than the other baos and I can imagine my younger self eating this while walking to school thirty years ago. Also got the rabbit and the Keroppi looking one. Not a fan. Oh!!the hedgehog porcupine looking one is really good too if you like taro. Yes, taro- not ube. There IS a difference. :) Bao bao dim sum also have main course Asian dishes like mince meat and rice and the typical go back home to your mom's cooking. I haven't tried any of those dishes but they did look really good too."

I was breezing through Chinatown in Montreal and trying to find a place to eat when I saw an ENTIRE window display of the cutest baos. I got some because... why wouldn't you want to get some adorable looking bao? I was expecting that although they looked great, the taste would be rather meh. But I was wrong! The bao were pretty delicious. The bao was nice and fluffy but not tough on the outside, and the inside flavors of custard, red bean, and black sesame were pretty classic. It was a guess to see which bao were which flavor, but they were all delicious!"

My favorites are the black sesame and the salted egg custard. Nowadays in Asia, there's a trend to put salted egg yolk on everything. I was curious about it and when I saw this place has the salted egg custard buns, I tried it and was pleasantly surprised by the mix of sweet and savory taste."

We really like these buns because they were not greasy like the other buns that we have tired in the past. That was a big plus for us.

Spot in Chinatown.The stuff they sell there is Cantonese with a Japanese cutesy twist.I always promise myself to go back and take the savory/not buns options that are more typical of HK. Can't wait to rightfully do so.The only complain: No seats (4 at the window) and very crowded.

This bakery also sells bubble tea and regular buns and pastries.  It's in Chinatown and is similar to other Chinese bakeries in the area (and in Chinatown in Toronto) except they are the only one I know of that make the cute cartoon steam buns.  Oh and they also sell Dim Sum.    I only tried the cartoon buns.  5 stars for cuteness, 3 stars for taste, so overall 4 stars ;)"

The creme is very silky and amazing when eaten warm. We came back 2 times per day (3 days) and we finally had one since it was popular. The other baos are great and we are planning on getting the Taiwanese chicken (size of a hand). Note it's cash only and they only take Canadian debit card. No domestic or foreign credit cards. They say they can do a 1:1 replacement of US dollars but don't do that as you devalue your American dollars and you're waisting your money. Next to it is a great bubble tea place and have lots of other chinese to go desserts and savory dishes. Overall great and cheap food.

The animal dessert buns are pretty cute and taste pretty decent if you have a sweet tooth and want the carbs. Food is definitely worth the stop. The bbq poem bun is exactly what you would expect. The bread for the buns are pretty thick which adds after a while.I've never had the Hong Kong Milk Tea before but it awesome! Like a black tea version of a Thai ice tea

All of the buns are sweet flavored, but that totally aligns with how cute they are! Definitely one of the most creative bao places I've been to. They also have a huge selections of bubble tea, slushes, juices, etc. Every bun goes for about $2, which isn't terrible because they are pretty large. They were also having bubble waffles with ice cream and toppings all for only $5! The egg waffle was sweeter and softer than a lot of the other ones I've had, but for sure it was filling. If you're in the area, I definitely recommend stopping in!"

/user_details?userid=41XG-tkYXv7uHubdPgetJQ,Andrew N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"In the heart of Montreal's Chinatown is a Bao store that you can't miss because of their eye-catching animal Baos. I couldn't pass on this opportunity to eat some cute bao buns so I HAD to try it. Here's my rundown:Food - I'm a sucker for anything taro and really wanted to try their taro paste buns, but I was disappointed that they didn't have these in stock despite coming fairly early on that day. Instead I got the following:-Frog Bao Bun (Green Tea with red bean paste) - Honestly, I was disappointed with the way this tasted as the green tea tasted poor in its quality and the red bean paste had a weird aftertaste. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you like cute frogs.-Chicken Bao Bun (Mango Coconut) - This was better than the frog bao but the mango coconut paste inside was very sweet. Great for people who like sweet things and coconut but the combination with mango was a little off-putting for me.-Bear Bao Bun (Brown Sugar with red bean paste) - Despite having brown sugar, I thought this was the overall best bao bun. When combined with the red bean paste, the brown sugar actually complements the aftertaste of the red bean. I would get this if you're looking for something to appease your taste-buds rather than your eyesight. Atmosphere - Not much to say here because there's no dine-in option. You pay for your food and eat around Chinatown or at home. There are a lot of lights in here and it's quite flashy inside. Pretty typical of your Chinese fast food place.Service - Service was ok. No complaints here. They're pretty fast with taking orders and getting the food out which is commendable.Price -The bao buns were $2.50 a piece. I really liked how there was no tax on the buns which was good; however, they don't take credit card which is a bummer.Verdict - Food that is better off looking rather than eating. Honestly, if you're expecting great food out of these cute bao buns then you'll be disappointed. They're good filler food and good for a one time thing but as a regular, I wouldn't see myself getting this again. It was a shame I couldn't try the taro paste bun, but out of all the buns I did try, I would recommend the Bear Bao Bun over the other buns."

We tried a few of them, with the chocolate ones winning over the fruit.Would like some of the bun designs to have different flavorings, but alas, that's how they sell them. Ie. I wanted to eat the ""red angry birds"" one, but didn't want the strawberry filling.Not the best bun you'll find in this Chinatown, but still, a fun place to grab a bun for the road."

They are probably most well known for their adorable cartoon buns. All their buns are fresh and hot right out of the oven when your order them. All the buns are adorable and the fillings are tasty.  I love the hello kitty custard buns here! It's soft and delicious. Buns are relatively cheap around $2 each. I've also tried the melting custard bun. This was actually melting inside. But I prefer the regular custard one better. I bought a total of 9 bun at once one time and they stuffed them into the boxes. In one box they put 4 buns. All the buns ended squished and deformed looking. Be careful when you buy multiple buns. You should ask them to bag then separately instead. That might be better than boxing them. Overall, decent place. Nice presentation of buns. There is limited seating. The shop has only a few chairs. Can probably sit up to 5 people."

There was also a hair in my friend's panda sesame bun! The hair wasn't just sitting on the bun, but rather little pieces were embedded in the dough. My friend politely informed the lady at the register about the bun. The lady appeared annoyed, dismissively gave her a new bun and made no effort to apologize.

The best part? They have these ridiculously adorable and cute animal bao buns (think bunnies, chicks, frogs, bears, and even, yes, Hello Kitty). They can be fit for desserts or breakfast options because they have delicious innards such as: mango and coconut, red azuki bean, and sweet potato. Their bao bread is soft but also very dense, so one bun is a meal in itself. However, these are super reasonably priced at about $1.79 CAD so you can easily get a dozen for a party or brunch without breaking the bank. They also come hot as well, so if you want to eat on-the-go, you can get one from the oven cases.

The establishment is actually an amalgamation of two: One is a pastries/bakery and the other is a take out place (for the Bao and Dim Sum) with an immense selection of bubble teas and other Asian drinks.The curry beef Bao is excellent, the black sesame seed Bao looks adorable, and the Hong Kong style egg tarts are amazing!"

There is a huge selection of sweet and savoury baos, sticky rice treats, dim sum items, etc. Although the prices are low, I can't help but think that they would have been at least five time cheaper in China. Oh well. As with Chatime, Bao Bao Dim Sum can be understaffed, resulting in long waiting times at peak hours. It also happened quite a few times that requested items were no longer available.  Overall, the shop does a good job at marketing products that would otherwise be difficult to approach by unfamilliar clients.

For the price they sell them, it's actually pretty good. I almost couldn't eat them 'cause I felt like I was torturing them. My buns were hard though when I ate them so that was a little disappointing. The dough was also on the thicker side which meant more chewing. I wished they would have reheated mine or told me to microwave them. Cute place though!"

The bun to filling ratio was not ideal. It could've used more filling and less bun. You can taste the green tea in the bun, but the filling was not a good match with the green tea. The custard-filled bun was better. They only accept cash."

Since my visit to hongkong summer 2016 I have been longing for cute scrumptious buns . And as a fan of hello kitty, I had to try this place for my visit to Montreal Chinatown. Some of the buns are savory, and my favorite is the red beans.  The shop however is a bit small. They also sell bubble teas and other pastries. A must place to visit."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",3 star rating,"Small place selling their cutesy bao buns I. The shapes of cute animals plus a pretty diverse offering of small dim items and snack food and bubble tea right next to my fave Chinese bakery (Harmonie) in Chinatown MTL. I've sampled a bunch of items here. I took home a few of their sticky rice (lo mai gai) plus some of their dim sum items (har gow and siu mai). The dumplings were in my opinion a bit on the pricey side $1 each (4 for $4). Ahhhh Lordy, I can remember getting 4 dim sum pieces in Chinatown Honolulu for $1.75 each. However this is close to twenty years ago so I clearly need to re-calibrate my brain for 20 years of inflation. The flavour was nothing amazing just ordinary. The sticky rice was okay when I brought it home. A very large serving size for around $5. Good pork offering, mushroom in that gooey soya based sauce. Their snack offering is quite large so I'll come back and test out some other items. Overall a decent 3.5 in my mind."

/user_details?userid=FgxomUUwhT8ECRtYbXnU6A,Deidrell Noraine S.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Their bao is OK. Their flavors are good and well executed, but not something special. I think what gives this place hype is the cute characters they make for their bao. Good for pictures, not very good if you're looking for something that will be fulfilling. If you're going to buy their bao, make sure you get them hot, and eat it on the spot. They won't taste as good if they're not hot."

However, after giving our order we were told they didn't accept any of our cards, only Canadian debit and would accept our US dollars however it had to be 1 to 1 with the Canadian currency, despite the American dollars higher value. While the pork buns are sweeter than anticipated they still tasted good but these are not the best buns I've had. The 'Keroppi' themed bun we ordered smelled delicious and tasted fine but it lacked filling and was very dry overall. Additionally, the staff was very unwelcoming, when inquiring about other menu items they rudely cut me off and shut down any further questions. Overall, these buns are definitely instagram-worthy in appearance however the poor customer service and lack of flavor definitely decrease it's value as an establishment."

Can't taste any strawberry and lack of chocolate in the bun. The durian puff doesn't taste like durian, just a thick paste filing with no taste. The bubble was hard, but the lychee flavor was strong. Only cute to look at."

It is next to Cocobun and offers a more steamed versions of buns compared to the baked ones in Cocobun. The highlight of this shop is the cartoon-style steamed buns that come in different flavours: I tried matcha red bean (frog), taro (porcupine), mango coconut (chick), sesame (panda). The best is mango coconut according to me. The price is a bit high, but the buns are really filling, which balances it out. I love how cute these buns are!"

Imagine a pie filling, but savory, and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.  Every other bao I have had was filled with more meat and was only slightly moist. Being a visitor to Montreal, maybe this is the local style?  If so, please know that this is not what bao should be."

I went 4 different days, every day they did not have the custard bun (crème anglaise). The last day they had some, but were sold out just as it was my turn to order. They said they would not have more for 1 hour. It is inexcusable that you do not plan ahead to have one of your most popular buns available during opening hours. I do not recommend this bakery unless you enjoy unpopular flavors that do not sell out."

Food and taste wise is horrible. All the 4 and 5 star ratings from other yelpers had me dispirited at this point. The bao IS big with very little filling. We bought five different bao character cos of the different fillings. We were excited to devour Hello Kitty as our first option. We each took two bites and gave up because it's literally just bao with a pinch of filling in those bites. The boa taste like any other bao, nothing special about it. We also ordered 'Cherng Fun' (and other items on the menu) which is known as steamed noodles. If you grew up eating this, you know it's the fresh steamed noodles, sweet sauce, peanut sauce, and a sprinkle of roasted sesame seeds that makes you smile. OMG, this 'cherng fun' is nothing like that. The noodles were old and a bit hard, peanut sauce is liquidity, and NO SWEET SAUCE (did we travel to a different planet?)!!! Took one bite and didn't want to look at it any more. Overall, if you only care for the cuteness of the bao and Instagram purposes then you should give this place a visit. IMO, it's not worth my stomach space."

I asked if they had a minimum using a credit card and the cashier said $5, so I ordered a large taro drink instead of a small. When I inserted my chip card she said they only accepted debit (if I would of known I would of ordered a small). No one started making the drink and the 2 cashiers started helping customers behind me. After waiting a few minutes for my drink I realized no one was making it. I asked the cashier who was making my drink and she said someone was. I asked who and only then they started making it. I was told the wrong info, lost money since I used American money (straight conversion), and it took 10 minutes for my drink because the 2 cashiers did not complete my order. As a tourist, my time and money is valuable that I would rather spend it at another establishment."
