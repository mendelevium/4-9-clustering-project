I will say, I do always get vermicelli instead of pho, but the quality of the meat they use is so far superior to and place in the states it blew my mind. In addition to the great quality meat, the variety of vegetables that they use and the freshness also surpasses previous experiences.I will say my girl friend had the pho, she has grown up on pho, and would give it a four star rating. She says the meat was better quality, but she has a hard time rating anything five stars that does not beat her mom's home cooking or the pho in Vietnam.Happy eating!"
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Who knew the best pho place I've had in Montreal would be right down the street? I'm so glad I gave this place a try because my usual place was closed. I was really surprised to find that a bowl of pho in Montreal cost ~10 dollars. And even more surprised by the quality and taste of it! I always go for the beef special because a love a variety of meat and tendon, and this definately reminds me of pho places I love in California. The flavor of the broth is very intense and delightful. The noodles even have a rich and almost buttery flavor. When I order to go, it definitely lasts two meals. I highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",3 star rating,"**Pho Quest, International Edition**After several days of endless poutine and gluttonous foie gras meals, I was on the search for something clean and healthy.  Both pho and ramen, popular on the West Coast when weather dips cooler don't appear to be much on the radar in Montreal. Fortunately, Pho Mont-Royal fit the bill and, although my expectations were tempered, hit the spot. The restaurant space is long and narrow with plentiful table seating and natural lighting.  Vietnamese music played quietly in the background and there's a Vietnamese mural, the decor is clean and bright.  The menu focuses largely on noodle soups, dry vermicelli dishes, and rice dishes. Our order:BBQ Quail - $5.50. I had seen Quail on a few Gre ch restaurant menus in the area and decided to try one here.  It was nicely crispy and seasoned well with a side of fish sauce. Simple but tasty. Pho Dac Biet and Pho Tai Nam Sac - $10. Both dishes were large and generous for the price and also available with rare beef on the side (always a baseline good sign).  The broth was appropriately hot and cooked the rare beef nicely with a flavor that while not particularly beefy or full of depth hit my pho craving.  Noodles were ok, likely dry packaged noodles, and the tendons were quite tough, not cooked long enough in the broth. The meat slices however were quite good quality especially in the Pho Dac Biet.  Although the pho Tai Nam Sac was priced the same, I found the well cooked steak to be tougher and thicker cut.  Def go for the Pho Dac Biet. Overall, we had a good meal here.  Coming from California, I was looking for an alternative to the rich and deep fried food of Montreal and Pho Mont-Royal delivered. Pho Mont Royal accepts credit cards but not Amex."
/user_details?userid=iiI3DdU8c588B0RPaKAGfw,Pied-A-Terre M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've never been disappointed coming to the restaurant. I've been coming here for the last two-and-a-half years and it's been both my little Escape and also my guilty pleasure. Their food is succulents and fresh.
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"Casual pho restaurant in the plateau, prices are very cheap and the decor inside is actually quite nice and modern. The service was okay , polite but awkward and not so attentive at times. The food itself was decent but nothing to write home about. I had the pho with half rare beef , the beef was good and the ingredients were fresh but there wasn't much in there in terms of portion size for veggies and meat and noodles in terms of ratio to broth and the broth lacked flavour. The fried spring rolls were good though , very tasty and good portion size. All in all this wasn't a bad experience it just wasn't a memorable one. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it for themselves though,  it's not a bad option for a quick pho fix on a budget."
/user_details?userid=RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA,Leanna K.,"Raleigh, NC",3 star rating,"Takeout review! I've ordered from this place a handful of times and I think I can make an informed review by now. Delivery has always been fast and friendly. And the food is always hot and fresh. I order for the pho (rare beef) mostly, as I miss it from back home. It is a decent enough broth, a little anise heavy, but a clear beefy broth that's been prepared well. The noodles are always the right texture, and they always give you a good amount of sprouts/basil. Their fried goods are always tasty and not greasy. The portions of their take-out meals (grilled chicken, lemongrass chicken)  are on the small side(judging by photos it seems you get more if you eat in) and am a little disappointed that they use styrofoam for their delivery containers.All said and done it hits the spot enough and the quality and convenience outweighs the negatives."
/user_details?userid=4CloKyf7-55SFGo748UQFA,Nicolas T.,"Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is by far the best delivery service I ever had the privilege to witness in my whole existence. I barely had time to confirm my order that the driver was kicking down my door to force feed me the chicken I ordered. Should you read a negative review written by one X-avier, pay no heed for he is a known liar and miscreant."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",1 star rating,"No! Why does this place have 4 stars?! It deserves 2 at most!Vietnamese is one of my favorite cuisines, I have it a lot, and I've never been disappointed like this. The vermicelli noodles were a sad sloppy mess, the tofu was horrific, the lemongrass sauce didn't taste of lemongrass, there were no fresh herbs or nutty toppings, and worst of all, the crispy fried noodles were not freshly fried but cold and tasted as if they'd just been put from a package onto a plate and covered with sauce. And all this wasn't even cheap!The waiters were nice and I'm really sorry I have to give a bad review. But maybe this will encourage the management to improve their kitchen."
/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I have to admit I got in thinking I'd have an average meal; I was mentally ready. I have to say I was pleasantly pleased. Not that it's the most authentic place. I ordered the lemongrass beef and it was quite all right. Service was nice and friendly.
/user_details?userid=Cwpyjs1PIHmDxjaLPcyt5A,Vivian L.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"The pho here was delicious; totally beat my expectations. My friends and I all ordered the #22, the pho with well done beef. The soup was perfect, the vegetables plentiful, and the beef cooked to perfection. With the oisin and Sriracha added in, we were in hot soupy heaven on that cold March day. I highly recommend this place for pho.We arrived around 4 PM on a Monday afternoon, so the atmosphere was very quiet. There was one waiter, enough to attend to us. He was kind, soft-spoken, and quick.I've put a 4/5 because the music in the restaurant was kind of weird. But otherwise, super super super great place for pho!"
/user_details?userid=xva4w2TD1YjAzjxw4qjdRQ,Amelia S.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"I've found my local Vietnamese joint! Stopped by on moving day to get a break from cardboard boxes and packing tape and was just a couple minutes shy of the midi speciale. Fortunately staff was flexible enough to let us still partake. Got a beef sauté citron with vermicelli noodles and a midi express. Fresh, fresh, fresh, flavours are all they've got going on here. Spring rolls and veggie wraps were crisp in their own way and service was efficient. Until next time"
/user_details?userid=2G8CdzQkXzw4y928cx4kdQ,Marina S.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"I'm going to start with this: anyone who gave this place 4 or 5 stars either has a broken mouth or is milk-toast white as all hell. Ok, so first let's just start with the take-out menu I read: there's no description for spring rolls, imperial rolls, etc. So thinking spring rolls were veggie, I ordered them. Thank god I noticed there were prawns inside before I took a bite or my ghost would be writing this review. Now onto the phō: the broth was terribly bland. By the time I got done with it, it was 97% soy sauce and siracha. Also there was no mint or sprouts???? And the chicken was grilled then put in with the veg, instead of cooked in the broth, so I found that very odd. I'm still new to Montreal, so I'm not sure if this place just wasn't great or of this is normal Montreal practice--you know, to have lacklustre Asian food. God, I miss Vancouver."
/user_details?userid=3EskadlobDxCwIvaGaAV4g,Luan N.,"Morrow, GA",5 star rating,Their Nem Cuon (fresh rolls) are very good! The dipping sauce is truly Vietnamese and very good.
/user_details?userid=MqiWjAOqN-_j5rJwqn0LOQ,Keane T.,"City Place, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I had curry vegetables, grilled beef, and imperial rolls. Everything tastes good and the fish sauce was not too strong. My only possible criticism is the grilled beef could have been thicker and it took awhile before my food arrived.  I'd definitely come back to try the other dishes on the menu."
/user_details?userid=ecj1GHzjQOHlL5P6lpNmpQ,Carrina D.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,Great place to stop by on a cold day. The soup is savory and delicious. Excellent service. Would come back the next time I visit Montreal!
/user_details?userid=Z8RQ2buT9GZNN-CThSe8ZQ,Evelyn C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"A surprisingly delicious find after shopping in the area.  We all had pho. The noodles didn't taste like fresh noodles but the broth was rich and hearty and the beef was good!  As Asians from Toronto,  we are picky with our pho and this place is perfectly acceptable!"
/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice place! Good ambiance. Food was ok, no exciting for me but nice, warm and tasty. While I had beef and chicken, my vegetarian companions found a good alternative easily. The waiter was nice, but was absent part of the time and his apprentice did not speak good English. Still, I would rate the service as good, and the meal preparation time as most reasonable. Would come back here sometime."
/user_details?userid=a_CLAoxJBsDeq5zHPU09sA,Alexandre S.,"Montreal, Brazil",5 star rating,"excellent! savory food, fair prices, big portions. had the frog legs, it was DELICIOUS. Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=W3Wvaf8YoFH-cnjVil4tNw,Jenna M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They deliver! Perfect when I'm hungover! They serve savoury pho, great fried wontons and everything is fresh and they're really nice folks. They have the traditional pho with tendons! Very hard to find in the Plateau/downtown area. Even Chinatown doesn't have it this authentic. It's a byob restaurant as well."
/user_details?userid=co5CRpju3hqaO0gT6VcmxQ,David A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Pretty good I have to say! The soups, imperial rolls and mains were all very decent. Would return here again! Easy for us who live close by."
/user_details?userid=MIFeW7gHOZvb4nYH8KFzfw,J R.,"Oshawa, Canada",3 star rating,Descent enough but I found the pho broth ho-hum. There are much better options in China town.
