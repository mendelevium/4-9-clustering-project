/user_details?userid=A1p7_78TTBocmBqLuZ_MFg,Jill-ann P.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Coming from a town that is devastatingly lacking in decent French restaurants I was excited to travel to Montreal. My husband had been to this restaurant the day before for work and loved it so I put it on my walking map. A sole diner, I sat the bar and received simply lovely service. I started with the Parfait du Foie Gras and then had the Salade Nicoise. Both we impeccable. The Nicoise had a large cut of lightly seared ahi.  The vegetables were well seasoned and had a crunch of sea salt. The Foie Gras was a small terrine with aspic and was creamy heaven. I enjoyed it all with a glass (or two) of Sancerre.  Serge was fantastic.It is a long, skinny restaurant that gives the air of intimacy up front before opening to a larger (and seemingly louder) dining room in the back. Needless to say, I preferred the front/bar."
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Monarque is a beautifully appointed restaurant boasting a trendy and modern interior. I even commented on how beautiful the floor is. The food was excellent and the standouts for me were the halibut (incredible!) and the tuna tartare. I also had the oysters (excellent) and the scallop which is very good (a little disappointing that there was only 1 scallop though). We finished with the ricotta cheesecake which was also very good. The presentation is lovely. Where it loses a star for me is the service, which was very slow on a Saturday night, and our waiter was quite standoffish. We waited an abnormally long time for our food, and sometimes the waiter would disappear. Not the warmest service I've had the fortune of receiving. There is definite room for improvement regarding the service, especially at this high price point. You expect 'red carpet' service. Other than that, the food and the ambiance are on point."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A whole lotta hype. That's what I get from reading these reviews where five stars are thrown at a restaurant with a little too much ease these days. If Monarque is a 5, what would you give Joe Beef? You have nowhere to go up from there! There's nothing wrong with a 3 if the meal was generally good, 4 if the experience was unique and wonderful with a few small flaws, and 5 for those who breath the rarified air that make the human condition worthwhile.Monarque (the brasserie side) is a solid 3, no more, and no less. The restaurant is very well appointed but a little sterile and bright for my taste.As if the restaurant had actually attempted to perfectly replicate the main complaint from the previous Yelp reviews, we waited a good 20-25 minutes from the time we were seated, to the time we had a drink in our hands. When one goes out on a Saturday night and pre-drinks a bit before getting in the Uber, it is essential to avoid losing the buzz when you get to the restaurant. We all know that lost buzzes cannot be recovered once the sobering up process begins and you start eating. So do me a favour Monarque: Up the drink game and the service. I don't want to hear about how big an operation you have going. YOU decided to open one of the largest restaurants in the city. Please staff it appropriately. Have you ever been to Gibby's? Pretty big place. It's a converted horses' stable sprawled out over two levels. Talk about service! The waiters are on you from the second you sit down to the end of your meal like white on rice. It's like having a personal butler or a daycare mommy nervous about allergies watching you eat and insuring that your every desire is met immediately, often before you even ask. I'm not asking you to be Gibbys, because there is only one of them and they are the best. All I'm asking is that you schedule a few more staff on a Saturday night. The food is good, but my main gripe is that there exists a better version at other restaurants of nearly every dish I sampled. They divide their menu into snacks, appetizers, and main courses.We began with the pretzel and the baseball mustard. If you've been to a sporting event, you've tried one. Same deal.The high point of the night was the smoked fish croquettes which were light, and bursting with flavour.I had the Caesar salad which was served as an insultingly small portion for 17$. I'm not into art projects on a plate, if the underlying food is not up to par. There were about 2 leaves of lettuce in the whole salad. It was forgettable and gone in a few bites. Check out the picture. Please go to restaurant Gus if you want to see a Caesar salad in all it's glory (or read my review on Yelp).My wife ordered a lamb ravioli appetizer for 18$. It came with 3 small raviolis. They tasted good....but certainly not 6$/piece good. If you need 18$ for this dish, there have got to be 5 or 6 pieces included. They are bite sized. It's not going to change your restaurant's bottom line. They were ok, but again, I can think of 20 Italian restaurants in this city that would do a better job of this and give you far better value.For a main, I had the 12oz ribeye (dry-aged) with fries. Let me understand something; This place is related to Lemeac in some way? That's nice. Did they forget the french fry recipe along the trip down from Outremont to Griffintown? Whereas Lemeac fries are otherworldly, Monarque's fries are only slightly better than the McCain fries in your grocer's freezer. The Ribeye was tender, and served with a gelatinous pepper sauce which was necessary given a lack of seasoning on the meat. I'd like to see how they do a hangar steak. The gold standard is Lemeac or L'Express.My wife had the Bouillabaisse which was extremely tasty, but unfortunately,  consisted mostly of bread and fish bisque with a paltry couple of shellfish. (check out the picture). As a side dish, she had the fried Cauliflower which looked amazing but tasted extremely bland and neutral.As a nice touch, the waiter obliged me by serving me a Paris Brest which is only on the dessert menu of the fancy half of the restaurant. It was quite good but.....you guessed it......nowhere near as tasty as the ones sold at Premiere Moisson or Due de Lorraine. I'm sorry that this has turned out to be a harsh review, as I was really excited about coming here. In the end however, there is nothing overly original about this restaurant, beyond its size and the buzz on the street which is still going strong. Unfortunately, I cannot see Monarque surviving much longer than 5 years or so given that it is so derivative and adds very little that is new to the Montreal landscape."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"* This is a 4.5 star review*I finally made it here after passing by for a year during the construction of this fabulous restaurant. Be prepared for an exquisite experience that will not disappoint. The restaurant is split in two sections: brasserie and dining. Both extremely welcoming depending on what you are looking for. So I would definitely give a 5/5 for ambiance. I had the steak with fries which was cooked to perfection. I also had their salad which was extremely refreshing. I don't know what is in the dressing but it's simply delicious. 5/5 for foodThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive. 5/5I am not giving a five star since I found there were too many rules and not enough flexibility around their menu. Firstly, I wanted half salad and half fries with my steak but unfortunately I could only pick one and order the other. Most restaurants are usually lenient about the option of choosing half and half. Secondly, depending on which section you choose to dine, you can only order from the menu designated to that section. A bit strict, don't you think? Otherwise everything else was great! I will definitely be back :-)"
/user_details?userid=tvf-Rp4XmuFglNatRD_gGA,''Rob C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A very pleasant and classy experience!  Went here for business lunch and was treated to excellent attentive service. I ordered the  bone marrow and escargot starter and while it tasted great with ample escargot (at least 6 of them) there wasn't much bone marrow.  I do recognize that bone marrow is hit or miss in terms of serving size. My main was the seafood bouillabaisse and it was the best I ever had. It has a wonderfully crispy  piece of fish (snapper?) and a generous medley of mussels, shrimp, squid, fish, and scallop.  A nice rich broth really flavoured it well. Definitely worth going back for."
/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",5 star rating,"I only spend a few days a year in Montreal so I take time the rest of the year compiling lists of places to go when I'm here. My inbox is filled with notes to myself with links to reviews and blogs; I also check Instagram more often than I should for hints. My crazy system is not foolproof, hence I don't recall how exactly Monarque appeared on my radar. And I will confess, I almost canceled these reservations several times in favor of other, more popular restaurants. What can I say, other than I didn't know any better?Monarque is a large and eye-catching restaurant that stretches across a city block and is made up of three distinct areas: a long bar at the front, a charming area overlooking the plexiglass-enclosed kitchen and meat-aging area, and finally the glamorous dining room that is a throwback to early Mad Men episodes. We sat in this room, with the black leather and wood banquettes, mid-century modern armchairs, and brass fixtures. The menu is rather small but well curated with cold and hot appetizer/ small plate sections, as well as an entrée section. We both started with the line-caught tuna, meaty chunks of impossibly fresh tuna tartare on a mound of thick and creamy foie gras custard, all topped by a thin crust. We agreed that this was simply amazing.Next, I had the beef cheek pot-au-feu, served in a well-seasoned broth with a few farfalle noodles. The beef cheek was unsurprisingly tender. The flavorful meal reminded me of a favorite Chinese dish that my dad prepares whenever I visit.I was slightly disappointed by the grilled duck breast entree, prepared as requested, medium rare (closer to rare) which was less tender than expected. Served with peanuts, black beans, and greens, the dish was nonetheless tasty.For dessert, there were several interesting choices. I was cautious about the Paris-Brest pastry, since most versions previously sampled have been average. Our helpful server, who guided my sister through all her selections, recommended it highly so we both decided to go with it. Joy! The pastry itself was fresh and crisp. The pastry cream was amazing with the hazelnut flavor shining through. In retrospect, we should have shared that dessert and ordered either the tarte tartin or (and) pavlova to also sample. Next time, we promised ourselves and our server.On a Friday evening, the restaurant filled up quickly. Office staff from nearby, long-time friends, and family members helped to create a convivial dining experience."

I was worried that it would be noisy, but really it wasn't and somehow maintained the cozy vibe despite being packed.Our waiter, Guillaume was wonderful: candid, helpful and funny as hell. He made some really interesting wine pairing suggestions and all of his food recommendations were spot on.I started with the trout tartare...wow! The quinoa crunch and eggplant purée were such a treat and really took the dish to a new level. The bouillabaisse was incredible and could have easily fed 2 people. I'm not a dessert person, but the lemon tart was pure perfection and the basil was such a fun addition to it. Been here 3 times now and every single time I am left wanting to lick my plate and never leave...I even covet the gorgeous Art Deco tile floors!"
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was another place on my list to try. Having never really looked up to see exactly where it was, I pictured it to be a typical Old Montreal restaurant: small to medium size, warm darkish lighting, quiet.NOPE! Boy was I totally off!!!! LOL!This place is GINORMOUS. It goes from St-Jacques to Notre Dame! The mirrors inside add an extra illusion of space on top of the actually large space that it already is. It is well lit. It is not quiet. It is hustle bustle. And it smelled good!The staff was nice although there was a lack of ""personal touch"" to the service. It was not bad at all, it just didn't have that extra sparkle that smaller restaurants have, totally understandable.We settled for a couple glasses of wine and:-a hamachi crudo-a daily special of seared foie gras with coffee & yuzu mousse with red wine braised endive-butter-poached lobster tail with sunchoke & hazelnut -coal-grilled duck with peanuts, chrysanthemum & asian style black beans-a passion fruit pavlova Everything was absolutely delicious! ONLY THING was that the lobster portion was pretty small. The dessert was too sweet for my taste, I think it could use a bit more passion fruit.I'm already looking forward to coming back here. Note that the ambience is more of a eat-here-and-drink-elsewhere as it is so spacious, it sometimes felt more like a hall."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with friends.  Had heard lots of buzz about new foodie place from friends and reviewers so was excited to try it. You can eat at the more casual brasserie in the front or the more formal dining room in the back.  For this visit, we opted to try the brasserie.  Even though this is supposedly the more affordable option, three courses with tax and tip but no booze was $70+ for one person, so not a place to grab an inexpensive meal.  Having said that, the decor and service were excellent and the food was very good to excellent, so I would rate it worthwhile. I had a beet mock tail to start (preggo so no booze) which was really good, a little bit earthy, a little sweet, great flavour.  I felt less sorry for myself that I didn't get any wine.We ordered three appetizers to start, the snails with bone marrow, lamb ravioli, and squash with farrow.  The squash was the best dish, nutty and flavourful.  The marrow I found bland and the ravioli over salted.  I had the lamb rump as my main and it was delicious.  The meat was super tender and flavourful, sitting on a bed of ratatouille which was amazing, I just wish there had been a little more of it.  We split two desserts, the lemon tart and the sticky toffee pudding.  Toffee pudding was the winner by a mile.  The tart was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. Very satisfying evening, looking forward to a return visit to try the more formal dining room."

The cocktails are first rate and are highlighted by etched ice cubes with a monarque butterfly branded into them. The food was excellent: fois gras, squid with a squid ink topioca crust, rib-eye for 2 (loved the gratin potatoes), the halibut, everything was top notch. The service was also attentive and excellent. My waiter was a little hesitant making wine recommendations (something to work on guys) but I was able to work it out having several excellent options available at my target price point. This place is two notches up from Modavie and one notch below Barroco IMHO for you locals."

Everything is made on the kitchen, except the ketchup :)Establishment is eclectic, warm and cozy. Having a chat with Chef Jeremy, he said everything is customize to make it enjoyable not only for patrons but also the staff. And you can see it from the huge window to watch the kitchen to the open Salle à manger where waiters can freely move around.Staff's generosity and why I'll come back. I've spent 3 hours that evening and it was one of my best food experience. Why ? Waiters were flowing from the moment we ordered to when they pickup empty plates. They even say Happy Birthday to the table next to ours. Little intentions were remarkable."
/user_details?userid=XNbrAATnVNAg1eTjMjn-pA,Brittany A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My workplace rented out the private dining room in the basement of the restaurant for a work function on my most recent visit to Montreal for work so I was lucky enough to dine in this beautiful space.Our experience here was wonderful. The servers were lovely and the food was absolutely delicious. We entertained two separate groups of customers/partners at Monarque, one for lunch and then one again in the evening.During lunch, we had selected a few of their sharable plates along with selections of red and white wine. Everything was very tasty and presented beautifully. Stand out items I tried where the house made pita breads and hummus, spiced olives, and the awesome dessert tray with home made marshmallows.For the dinner time, we enjoyed a prix fix menu. My starter salad was amazing with house made burratta cheese and fresh veggies in a tangy vinegarette - omg so good. My fish main was also delicious and the pear eclair for dessert was just awesome.Highly recommend Monarque for either a nice meal in Old Montreal or using their beautiful private space for a special function as well."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely lovely experience! This restaurant located in Old Montreal is stunningly beautiful; the front end is the brasserie and the formal dining room is to the back, with an open kitchen behind glass separating the two venues. A group of friends and I decided to dine in the ""salle à manger"" where we were seated in these beautiful round leather banquets near the window overlooking Notre Dame street. We opted for all four courses; I had the crudo hamachi, pan fried sweetbreads with carrots, steamed black code with rapini salad, and the sorbet dessert. The food is fantastic! I love a resto that can take five ingredients and make perfection happen on a plate. Simple, beautifully presented, well executed and oh so flavourful! They have an impressive wine list; we had two bottles that were reasonably priced considering the price point of this resto. The staff was all super amiable. From the host to the bus boys, the service was professional and efficient. Although this restaurant has been open for a week now, you'd expect a hiccup here and there but we were all very content with our experience and are already looking forward to our next visit to try the menu at the brasserie."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We loved our experience at Monarque! The interior is absolutely stunning, it may be one of the most beautiful restaurants that I have seen in Montreal. The restaurant is modern but has a cozy atmosphere. The font part is a brasserie with a brasserie style menu and the back is the dinning room. Online you can reserve for one or the other. Being 4 we were seated at one of the round tables in the dining room.  I liked how the tables were spread out to make them a little private, they had comfortable chairs and banquettes and the restaurant is build to minimize sound because we were able to speak all evening without raising our voices.The service was excellent and the waitress explained that the menu was to be enjoyed in 3 courses with an option for dessert afterwards. We ordered the following:Course 1: -Burrata with a type of anchovy and greens (excellent!)-the tuna tartar with foie gras Fantastic, very unique and our favourite first course.Course 2:-Delicata squash with fried halloumi  -Farfalle with braised beef and jus. -Grilled Riz de veau All were excellent!Course 3 mains:-Seared deer with squash, mushrooms and red wine sauce-Rainbow trout with cauliflower puree and mushrooms-Porcelet with rutabaga and turnips  -Coq au vins with celery-rave puree, carrots and mushroomsAll were excellent but the deer and coq au vin stood out to me.Dessert:-tarte satin with a ball of ice cream on top. -Vacherin Glacé with raisins, coconut and meringue.Both were good just nothing special. The 3 other courses were so meticulously put together and paired interesting ingredients together while the desserts were just very plain. Overall, we loved our experience at Monarque. The service was excellent, our table was comfortable and little private and we had a delicious meal. A must try for a special occasion!"

He shared several places with me in Montreal and I happen to come here first. I decided to stop in for an adult beverage and catch up in a little reading. I am so glad I did. This is a great place. I love the atmospheric mood. They have an impressive wine display. The staff are friendly and the bartender made me two great Moscow Muse Drinks. What I really like is the various music which they play. Pop and R&B. I will definitely come back here before I.

Even at lunch it was busy and lively with a very fun ambiance. The place is divided in a dining room and a brasserie. The design is gorgeous too. Very bright with high ceillings. I felt the precision of the teamwork in every aspect of the service. I mean, for the amount of customer , any little error can put a step back to the service, but they knew what they were doing. We were in a private room in the basement for a private diner and had an amazing experience.The entrée was very fresh and tasty. Some shrimps and avocado in a creamy sauce. Uncomplicated but a great start. Next, was the half cooked trout that was also executed to perfection. The texture was amazing. And the eclair for dessert was as decadent as ever."

I've already been here three times in the last two months just for the steaks, and plan on returning again. The ambience is cosy and modern, and spacious. Very conducive for business and family dinners. There's a glass-wall section where you can watch the fun in the kitchen. Note: There's parking at a nearby indoor car park, on rue Notre Dam (at the back door of Monarque). The sign says $12 from 5 pm. However we could park our car there for free one Tue evening. Best to enquire at the restaurant."

(4.5* but I'm rounding up than down)  This time I went with a friend after a play at the near by Centaur theatre. We wanted a late night snack and thank god the bistro side of Monarque was still open (kitchen closes at midnight ).We had the bone marrow, foie gras parfait appetizers and shared the lamb main course. Everything was great but the lamb was the best out of three...though both of us found it a tad bit salty. (The appetizers were great and not too salty).  Last time I found my main course of pheasant just a bit tad on the salty side too on the restaurant side, but at the same time.......I haven't had better pheasant at another place...so.....(They have different menus for the restaurant and the bistro side).  My mint tea to finish off the meal was good but my friend's espresso was way too bitter...and she grew up with coffee.....so let's say that it's not her, but maybe at the end of the night it's the machine. It was late so we didn't want to complain when everything else was great.We couldn't finish everything and had to ask to take the lamb to go....but then since we were rolling ourselves out of the place from food comatose.....we forgot our leftovers!!! The tragedy! As went drove back to get it...but our server had thrown it away....so friends....learn from our mistake....don't forget your yummy leftovers!Also on a fun note we were sitting across from a table about twent people, all male except one woman. We tried to guess what industry they were in. They were speaking both French and English. At first we ruled out lawyers due to the gender imbalance.....but in the end we suspect they were either IP or acquisition and merger lawyers."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After reading a gushing review of Monarque I knew that I had to come check it out.  The restaurant is divided into a dining room and a brasserie.  The latter is the more affordable option though it still gets expensive so this is the place you come when you are looking to celebrate something or treat yourself.  The space is huge and I love how they have designed the interior.  It is very elegant and has superb ambiance.We were a group of three so we all ordered three different appetizers to maximize how much of the menu we sampled.  My favourite was the lamb ravioli.  The lamb was quite tender and the pasta had been cooked al dente which is how I prefer it.  That was followed by a veal meatball served with gremolata cheese and polenta.  The sauce was delicious and the meatball itself was very tender and I found the sauce had a well-balanced flavour.  It was a bit on the salty side though.For dessert we shared a lemon tart and a sticky toffee pudding.  As a fan of sticky toffee pudding I really enjoyed this particular one.  It was so moist and soft.  The lemon tart was not overly sweet so the lemon really stood out but it left a strong aftertaste.  Like I said before, despite being the cheaper of the two the brasserie will still get expensive.  My dinner cost me $110 after tax and tip.  That also covers two glasses of wine.  I definitely enjoyed my dinner and I feel like the prices are justified but I could only afford this kind of splurge from periodically.If Monarque isn't on your radar it definitely should be.  While pricey the experience here is fantastic and you will thoroughly enjoy yourself.  I would definitely want to come back to the brasserie or to try the dining room."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday night. It was 10pm and it was pretty packed. I like the design of the restaurant. There are booths to the left and the bar is on the right and mirror is everywhere. I like the wall of wine behind the bar and the fall decorations like cranberries and pumpkins. I started with a bloody Caesar which was just a regular Bloody Caesar. I switched to wine when the food arrived. My boyfriend had the bourbon cocktail. It tasted good and it was really pretty. We shared the grilled octopus entree. It was recommended by the barmaid. It was delicious! The octopus was well prepared and underneath was a layer of fatoush salad and labneh. I liked that the grilled octopus dish had that Arabic flavour to it.My then had the 7 oz dry aged PEI butchers cut beef served with herb butter and fries. I enjoyed the steak. The butter added even more flavour and i dipped the steak in my boyfriend's short rib dip. The fries were also good! Crunchy and salty. My boyfriend had the braised short rib beef sandwich served with panisse (fried chickpea flour fries) and salad. The short rib sandwich had a delicious dipping sauce! My boyfriend liked his sandwich but I wasn't too crazy about it because I don't like horseradish. The chickpea fries were amazing. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area but I would definitely this one and I would so come back and try other dishes.

Everyone's really nice, the menu isn't outrageously interesting but the food is made really well. I got the octopus (super yummy) and the market fish (cod?) well cooked. Still, between my two dishes it was a little bit one note.I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but it just didn't feel like a 5, i kind of felt like my server left and I would've gotten dessert but I was worried about time - their reservations not me. So, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come again but it was worthwhile and maybe you'd really like it. The place has a really nice intimate bar vibe, steady noise from tables but not outrageously loud, the food is served pretty promptly. I was solo dining so the first half of the meal it seemed like the bar staff tried to make sure I was taken care of."

Fun clientele & nice ambiance.  Decent cocktails. I had: Hamachi starter, Sweetbreads, and Scallop w blood pudding. My husband had Tuna tartare, black cod, and lobster. All the food was beautifully presented &  there were some interesting combinations (eg My Sweetbreads were toasted w coriander and served with a tahini type sauce--unique & nice). We both agreed the food was ""good"" but  nothing really stood out. In other words, there was nothing that would have us rushing back. The downside of the place was its service. The reception area was hectic and haphazard. It seemed the staff were overwhelmed buy the sheer volume of people (its a big restaurant). Our waiter was ok but pretty nonexistent. We had to wait nearly 1/2 hr to get iur first cocktail and our wine would run out before the waiter noticed. The food pacing was faster than drink pacing. So at the end the restaurant was 6/10 for service,7-7.5/10 for food & 8/10 for ambiance. Dinner for 2 w 3 services, 3 drinks each & dessert shared = $350 w tip Oct 2019--decided to give it another chance & was worse than last time. Score reduced from. 3.5-4.0 to 2.8. Why? 1) ***Awwwwwwful*** service. Ordered oysters, wild squid w squid ink ceviche, venison. Waiter didn't hear my oysters order (which we were sharing) despite convo we had about oysters. So they didn't arrive. Hmmm. Then too eternity to get our cocktail and after cocktail and 1st dish finished. Waiter never asked if we wanted another drink. We literally sat there w nothing on our table for nearly 20 min until we literally flagged our waiter and asked if we could order a wine. I thought restaurants wanted to serve you. Not Monarq. Their service was bad our first time & was worse on our 2nd visit. My husband and I wondered how such a restaurant still exists in Montreal where there is a plethora of delicious restaurants with better service. 2) completely boring food. The food felt like an old hotel restaurant or wedding dinner  in its taste. It was beautifully presented but lacked personality and was blah. Not to mention when I ordered 2 cheeses for dessert what I was served was literally two slabs of cheese with dry toast. No nuts, no jam, no dry fruit. Seriously?! Try harder. Overall one of my worst restaurant experiences in 2019. Avoid this place. Even though it's located in a great spot & looks beautiful."

/user_details?userid=rT52d2uiFqj7ggZ-9u7GOw,Karine D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This new restaurant has got it all: elegance, amazing food, great service, location and ambiance, superbe wine pairing. I simply can't find any negative points. First of all, the restaurant offers 2 venues: the dining room and the brasserie. We went for the dining room. To get the whole experience, it is suggested to get 4 courses. For the first course, I had the hamachi crudo, which was light and fresh. My husband had the tuna tartare. Rich and flavorful. Paired with an orange wine, it was exceptional. I thought 4 courses would be too much food for me so I skipped the 2nd course but since the portions of the first 2 are rather small, I could have easily had it. My husband had the scallop with blood pudding. Very tasty. For the main course, he had the wild striped bass with chorizo and I had the poached walleye. Both equally delicious. We had the ricotta cheesecake for 2 for dessert. Just the right amount of richness and not overly sweet.The whole experience was absolutely incredible. You have to try it!"

The decor is superb, and the service is exceptional. Seems like a rather fancy place but we never felt out of place even if we were dressed very casually (jeans & t-shirt). The food was great and the bartender Olivier had great recommandations for us for drinks and food. Everything we got was delicious and the portions are generous with high quality ingredients. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves...Definitely will make this a regular spot!"

My favorite dish was the Confit Trout as my second course, but the Scallop Crudo and Venison I had were both, also, very good. It's a more formal dining experience then I typically opt for, but I was very comfortable there."

We had a huge table for 12 of us right in front of the kitchen which gave a great show throughout the evening. Everything we had was top notch, the fresh bread, oysters, tuna tartare, the sweetbreads, beef for two with awsome cauliflower and potato gratin. There was parking for $10 but you have acces from behind."

/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My first impression when I walked in this restaurant was "" Wow it's huge and it's full of business men, Lol. It's lunch time and it's in the middle of the working district so it was not what I expected. Its  a three room palace.  Starting at the brasserie and ending at the dining area with a little in between. It's trendy and elegant with much hustle and bustle.The service is on point and delivered with a smile. I chose the Minestrone soup which was a delight, tepid the way I like it. The main course was Coq au Vin served with puree potatoes, full carrots and bits of mushrooms. The dark Porto sauce just added enough flavour to the chicken. Excellent! The only complaint I may have is the small portions. As always I ended my lunch with a cappuccino and 2 different dessert. Lemon tart,  which woke up my palette and sticky  toffee pudding served with buttermilk ice cream. That's heavenly,  the balance from the bitterness to sweetness of caramel. Highly recommend this place for the food  but I'm a cozy romantic kind of gal for ambiance"

Absolutely beautiful place. They offer 2 different menus for bar section and restaurant section. The menu is not overwhelming while leaving enough options to satisfy most. Ever single item was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and delicious. The service was impeccable and we truly enjoyed our meal and the interaction with staff members. Overall a solid venue, I'm sure it won't disappoint."
/user_details?userid=WJdEAliRWP7uW8luiu7atw,Jessica B.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"We were in Montreal for one night (near New Years) and wanted to eat somewhere authentic and GOOD. Well, as you might expect, everything was booked up. Except..Monarque. There was an opening, just one, at 6:15 pm in the brasserie. The next one was at 8:45 pm. We got lucky. Why the brasserie? We opted for the more affordable option, so feel free to ignore this review if you are planning to eat in the formal restaurant.As you do, we studied the menu ahead of time. We arrived right at 6:15, were seated promptly, and shown a wine menu. Everyone around us was drinking wine. We opted out, but the timing of the waitress was awful; she was either catching us too early or not at all. We waited 15-20 minutes before we even placed our orders...by which point we were starving and had memorized our orders. We ordered the steak tartare to share, I ordered the butchers cut steak, and my boyfriend got the pork chop. It took another 15 minutes before we got the steak tartare. It was meh. Very tender, creamy, but hesitantly seasoned. The crunch from the endive and potato chip were welcomed, but the flavors were imbalanced. Not enough salt when eaten with the endive and too (!) much with the chip. I know it's small. But given the reviews this place had, we expected that somehow something this minor couldn't and wouldn't happen. Yummy nonetheless.Another 20 minutes before we got our entrees (everyone next to us...who had ordered lots of drinks...not sure if that was correlated...had gotten their appetizers, entrees, and tons of attention in the meantime). My steak was SO GOOD. I ordered medium, it came out medium rare. Which wasn't ideal. But I didn't want to risk sending it back given that we were starving. The flavor of the steak, delightful. It was clearly a very good cut of meat. I won't say it was cooked well; it was just a good cut of meat, plain and simple. Now, the fries...mind my language, there was a stupid amount of them. So imbalanced! I was eating fries even after my boyfriend had finished his pork chop entree, like 10, minutes after I'd eaten my steak. The pork chop entree was good, seasoned well, the sauce was delightful, and the apple & squash were cooked well. Not a phenomenal dish, didn't blow us away, but still very good.It was 8:30 when our plates were taken away. So no, we didn't order dessert, lest we throw our evening away in this restaurant. If our service was better, we might have stayed longer to eat more food. But I'm glad we got to eat here and be a part of such a vibrant setting. It's good food - but be ready to commit a large portion of your evening to eat it."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here with a group of 8. We had made reservations and specifically asked for the brasserie part. Once we got there we were seated in the main dining room and when we got our menus, we realized that we were not in the right section. We told them about this and they apologized for their mistake and let us order from the Brasserie menu which was nice of them. We tried the Mozzarella de Bufflonne du Québec and the Parfait de foie gras and both were good but portions very small for the price. My friend also got the Chèvre frais aux herbes which I got the taste - good but nothing to rave about. I shared two plates with a friend : the Ravioli à l'agneau braisé and the Contre-filet. The ravioli were tasty but only 3 in a plate. The meat was cooked very nicely and the fries were ok. All in all, I would not come back to this restaurant as the prices are very steep for the portions they give. It is a very fancy restaurant if you want to go out and spend lots of money and you particularly enjoy french food and small portions. It did not satisfy my appetite at all."

First off the restaurant itself is incredibly beautiful and all aspects are well considered. Service was friendly and we met the chef/owner who was gracious. Th restaurant offers a full view of the kitchen which makes for dinner and a show.Menu is a nice mix of French brasserie with plenty of twists. We greatly enjoyed the cod fritter appetizer and the foie gras mousse. For dinner shared the large lamb serving with fries. The lamb melted in your mouth!Best of all was the dessert which is made in house, the chocolate hazelnut eclair.Monarque is just getting started in its quest towards the best in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=KFGSgKqC6uTOtBwXbQlVkg,Lori K.,"Fort Erie, Canada",5 star rating,Exquisite. Great atmosphere and service. Highly recommend. The spring onion was light and flavourful. I would suggest if you're having the cote de boeuf that you share with three or four. It's a lot of meat.
/user_details?userid=W3VfbyrqtWvnYVKdH4IouA,Ivana T.,"Silverado, Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,A coworker had recommended this restaurant to us and it was definitely a good call. The restaurant itself is really neat and huuuuge! It has two different sections and each has its own menu. The first section is a brasserie and is more casual fare whereas the dining side has fancy French inspired dishes. Our server was friendly and made some great recommendations and described the dishes to us. I had the guinea fowl and it was amazing! I would definitely recommend the pavlova and the hazelnut cream pastry for dessert (not at the same time as they really don't taste good together). Yum!

/user_details?userid=T1zcP2QrtEkC0MA9OR4imQ,Judy O.,"Smyrna, GA",4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant with a romantic ambience...would fit right in with other high end restaurants in NYC or Paris. The meat that is showcased being dry-aged will tempt the carnivore in you. The oysters were spot on, so fresh and delicious. Would also recommend the steak, the steak dip sandwich and octopus appetizer. The passion fruit Pavlova is out of this world. Staff super friendly and helpful. Price about standard for this level of fine dining but would definitely recommend for a nice dinner out in Montreal."
