/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was my second time trying Pizzeria Bros and I was not disappointed at all! Last time, we tried the MTL at the McGill location. We ordered the MTL pizza once again because we loved it so much! The toppings of this signature pizza include pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and onions.The crust was very crunchy and the toppings were quite fresh! Also, I have to point out that the tomato sauce was very well balanced and seasoned! If you are a thin crust pizza type of person then this pizza is perfect for you! At Pizzeria Bros you can choose one of their signature pizza OR customize your OWN pizza! You pick your type of dough, base sauce and toppings. And the pizza will be ready in less than 5 minutes!!Both in-person takeout orders and delivery options are available.La MTL ($14)"
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The freshest, fastest pizza ever! Pizzas are done in like 90 seconds after they prep it and it tastes great too. A good section of topping. We did pick up and got the La Saint Jean which included a wide variety of meats: Pepperoni, Jambon, Bacon, Saucisse BROS, Mozzarella.Super yummy! The original/traditional crust is a bit like thin crust pizza but it still has a nice chew to it. Only thing is that it's a little pricey."
/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Covid ordering: you can order online and choose the pizza toppings you want.They have vegan and gluten free options and you can customize everything. Definitely 1 pizza per person. It's thin slice. We went for 2 signature pizzas:La Mtl : Basic pizza with cheese, green pepper, pepperoniDecent pizza, kid friendly, you can't go wrong with itChristo: This one was better than La Mtl (especially when I added my own hot peppers) I asked for tomato sauce instead of the pesto in the order as there is an option to customize but they didn't customize it. Small error, we let it be. I prefer spicy pizza so when I got home I added my own hot pepper rings as an extra topping."
/user_details?userid=LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,Francis T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A friend brought us here as she had a wonderful experience previously and wanted to share it with us. It is basically a ""make your own topping"" pizza place.The good: Lots of choices. Lots of healthy food. Service is kind of quick. Cashier is friendly. Food is good. All fresh. Reasonable prices. Possibility of take-out.The bad: Young staff that have more fun talking to themselves than working. Which brings to this point, completely screwed up my wife's order BECAUSE of lack of attention (she is lactose intolerant, specified it, but went crazy on cheese, but they did end up making a new pizza afterwards). Air Conditioning way too cold. Limited tables and chairs. Lots of flies in the restaurant. Lots of people gets the place congested. The place is a good place with good food. Sadly, l wish the workers would have been more customer service focused."
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Located a block away from the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal in a Vieux Montreal neighborhood, Pizzeria Bros is a must try. Food: Pizza! A glass encased order line showcases all the fresh ingredients you could possibly have on your pizza. A large menu board above explains the concept. Make your own by selecting a base and ingredients or select one of their combinations. It's all made right in front of you and then popped into one of the several small red pizza ovens lining the back wall. Pizza comes out quickly. This is thin crust pizza at its best. You simply can't go wrong. Service: Counter-style ordering and you'll be given a tray for your food and drinks. Bottled drinks or a soda fountain are options for beverages. You'll bus your own tables. Cost: One MTL pizza and two fountain sodas ran us under CAD$20. Extremely decent! Overall: Good food with great ingredients. Space is clean and welcoming. Staff are friendly and welcoming. They take cash and cards."

What I like most about their pizza is the very thin and crispy dough, it's just enough and you feel like you could even eat two pizzas!"

Everyone speaks French and English and are all so nice and helpful.The pizza is SO fresh. I got the aloha with an extra ricotta on it. It was simply the best Hawaiian pizza I ever had.Finally I also had one cannoli, which was great, super authentic and tasteful. Really recommend it to everyone, I'm a great fan of it now."

We are visiting Montreal for the first time and got to town late our first night so we wanted something easy to grab for dinner to bring back to our Airbnb and this was ABSOLUTELY perfect. The folks there were incredibly friendly and efficient. We ordered 4 pizzas to go and had them all in under 15 min while my fiancé enjoyed a beer. Also, in have a gluten allergy and the gluten free pizza was DELICIOUS! My sister-in-law is a vegetarian so she was thrilled to see Beyond Meat on the menu as well! We definitely recommend Pizza Bros if you are in the mood for delicious, quick pizza!"

/user_details?userid=gJ9GinrVbKg_3yLLsxL0Xg,S N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Visiting from Vancouver, a friend recommended this place. At first I was a bit skeptical... I mean it looked like any modern pizzeria. Until I had a bite of a freshly made creation by Kevin! It was delicious... Italian sausage, pesto and finished with goat cheese and balsamicReduction. I highly recommend this place for the courteous and welcoming staff... and trying the ""Kevin special!""."
/user_details?userid=9UAhpwLHVg8E29Hbh0geqw,Amanda L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"So group of 8 devoured 7 pizzas (probably could have gotten away with 6 though).Definitely recommend: Aloha pizza (Hawaiian), Gigi (prosciutto) and Laura pizza if you see it. (Laura was a special pizza of the day that had racelette cheese, onion, mushrooms and arugula. So damn good!!)Such great service! One of our pizzas were charred a bit and the staff offered to comp it and make us another one! Also, the pizzas are done in these quick mini ovens. So maybe 5 min cook time?Ps. We specifically came here for the gluten sensitive crust option. So two of the pies had it. Gotta say, couldnt even tell the difference. It was that good!"
/user_details?userid=l-1cva9rA8_ugLrtSdKAqA,Vibhor S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Pretty good pizza. They throw on a generous amount of toppings, cheese and sauce. The only thing that could be better was the crust, which couldn't really handle the 3 toppings and got a bit soggy, so I had to use the fork and knife (I'm not classy enough to do that) and wasn't airy enough. Still, it wasn't all that bad. The service was good and quick too.Would definitely recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=3zf6YQhgn7MUJQ6J7lqU8Q,Simone W.,"Bloomfield, NJ",4 star rating,"I was so happy to find a pizza shoppe in Montreal , I was growing tired of the food. And I wanted something that reminded me of back home. We found this shoppe by just walking around and it was actually empty. So back in the states we have this pizza place called Blaze pizza same concept you build your own pizza. The pizza was quite delicious actually. And would be fit for any lunch , brunch, or dinner occasion. The space is a but crowded.  But is cutely and comfortably organized with the seating arrangement. I ordered just basic pepperoni pizza and it was good. Canadians make their pizza backwards, they put the dough , sauce, toppings, and then cheese. It was super interesting to eat this way. I kept thinking they messed my pizza up lol. But the toppings were actually inside the pizza. Fair pricing I believe everything came up to about 8 CA dollars including the drink. Cute little place to rest and eat after the long walking."
/user_details?userid=nvkLNe2lz5gAyg7az26VLg,Stanimir C.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I left with mixed feelings from this place. The concept of the pizza place is awesome(ingredients right in front of you, pizza being made in a matter of minutes) and the choices they have are so numerous. I really liked the food I ordered, too. But! I feel like the food comes out way too soon considering some of the ingredients might need a little longer to cook. At the end of the day my stomach wasn't exactly comfortable with the food and I think that wasn't just me. It could have been something else we ate but that's questionable. I can't dismiss it completely so I might have to give it another try, but they won't get a good rating until then."
/user_details?userid=New-yv7k9vZJw9iLTm0cEw,Neo V.,"Erin, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely the best gluten free crust so far!!!It was tender and didn't get dry and crispy after being cooked. I ordered just mushrooms and cheese and a pop and the total was $17, not really cheap, but worth every dollar. If your looking for regular pizza or Gluten Free pizza come here it's really really good. It's more casual atmosphere so I don't know if it would be the best for a romantic dinner or lunch but the taste was great."
/user_details?userid=2ZfhOYE8NKSxv8bXG5lDnQ,Oguz Cem C.,Turkey,3 star rating,I would say this is a good place to eat but the pizza was a bit ordinary. Staff is great for sure. Would try again with no big expectations.

They are on a thin crust. I got olive oil, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella, ricotta and fresh basil on mine. We went for lunch and I am still thinking about it at 9:30PM. The staff was so friendly & welcoming. We hope to go back soon!"
/user_details?userid=iqWpg6vfJc36OC14_FN5KQ,Charles S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great Pizza but they made it too much into a fast food than a pizza spot.

It is also very fast. By the time you pay, the pizza is ready! GO HERE! (Joshua, age 10)In addition to my son's review, I would add that the pizza is very fresh and full of flavor. We came here on a very rainy April evening. There were two professors debating the merits of science and politics in one corner. A lone man sitting in another corner, and my family of hyperactive children. We were welcomed into what felt like a locals-only corner pizzeria, and felt right at home."
/user_details?userid=RFnsBMoPXtwpu9n9uANHBw,Dana R.,"Hickory Ridge, Columbia, MD",3 star rating,The pizza was absolutely delicious however the restaurant was dirty. They need to take time to clean up their tables because it is in a very high traffic area. Also not a lot of air conditioning in the place.

/user_details?userid=CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,Jawad K.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",5 star rating,"Couple of steps away from the main attractions of the Old Port of Montreal, my wife and I on a Sunday night were looking for a treat :)! And here we are on Notre Dame in front of Pizzeria Bros : debating if we should eat and where to eat ... Sunday nights are always against the clock because Monday is around the corner ! But this pizza place was able to grab my attention : ready in 2 minutes ! Right away I told my wife here is our pit stop. As soon as we stepped in, we were welcomed with a nice smile by all 3 employees even tho they were busy preparing pizzas for a small group ahead of us ! The decor was really gorgeous, felt very warm and rustic ! My wife and I looked at each other and were a little disappointed that it wasnt a wood-fired oven ! But we really under estimated the power and results of their cute red individual, powerful ovens ! The menu is clear and simple : either you make your own pizza or you choose from a selection on the board ! One size fit all (10 inches) and you get to choose the type of dough (btw whole wheat is same price as the regular white dough) no reasons not to go healthy ! The pizza was created and ready in a speedy way ' but didnt feel neglected in any way... They knew we wanted to share the pizza and even offered to cut it and serve it on 2 seperate plates ...All types of oils, hot sauces, chili flakes were available and obviously like any authentic pizza joint - the absence of ketchup certifies the place :)The bench were comfy and unique in its style, great place for a casual date, a nice quick corporate lunch and price is VERY reasonable for the area !I was told 2 best friends that were so close that they called each other Brothers came up with this beautiful, successful restaurant ! I saw someone beside us enjoying a salad .. The portion looked very generous, next time for sureA must try and retry and retry...***A brother is a friend God gave you; a friend is a brother your heart chose for you.***"
/user_details?userid=cvBW7RDkXHG0Z0wZMx6tkg,Pierre-Yves B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite pizzeria along with Il Focolaio.Food: 5/5. Italian style pizza served in five minutes.The crust is thin, except for the gluten-free crust that looks like a naan (also delicious).Some pizzas are a bit too salty to my taste (the one with dried tomatoes) but overall it's good.There's a counter where you can add olive oil, oregano, tabasco, chili, etc. Staff: 5/5. Outgoing, reliable, nice, fast.Atmosphere: 4/5. Clean and casual.Price: 4.5/5 pricy but worth every dollar. Except for the $2 extra for the gluten-free crust, that's too much."
/user_details?userid=hvIejZRYX5Qgc_K0HXTS_g,Amiyr B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,My first stop on my Montreal leg of my Canada tour and it was well worth it. Before I get into the food I must say I love the location of this Pizzeria. To find it you have to walk through Old York. A fabulously quaint  neighborhood in Montreal. Now about the food Pizzeria Bros has amazing thin crust Pizzas that are fully customizable. Customization of pizzas is not unique it's the way they specifically  do them. They are delicious and they are created expeditiously. I would return to this spot on my next visit to Montreal. Finally I love the layout of this restaurant. It's very bright with ample seating and it seems very modern and clean. Pizzeria Bros is totally worth Checking into if your in town.
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It seems like my pizza cravings have me continuously checking out local pizza joints to ""make your own"" pizzas. This stop was Pizzeria Bros that has held positive reviews by fellow yelpers for quite a bit of time now. Walking in-the space was small but well organized with its seating. The first thing that caught my attention was the daily special that changes every day- you get a full pan sized pizza with your choice of non-alcoholic beverage for 13$ without tax. Their regular menu included assorted pizzas, salads and pastas. Beverages included soda and wine. I didn't have to wait long to get my order. The staff was quite entertaining sharing their own insight about their experience working at the restaurant. The pizza crust of my Sicily pizza was baked perfectly and thick enough to hold the toppings- hot peppers, tomato sauce, red and yellow peppers, mozzarella cheese - I paid a dollar extra to exchange pepperoni for prosciutto-perfect combination of salty and spice!  I was able to finish all my pizza and bottle of Perrier- I was happy that I wasn't stuffed but happily full!"

It was around 9.30pm and we were feeling a bit peckish. We liked the sound of customizing your own Pizza from the windows so decided to give it a go, not knowing what to expect. We immediately were made to feel very welcome with one of the guys making the pizza explaining the process to us and knowing that we wanted a quick bite so were going to share. Unlike some places, these guys understand if you don't want a pizza each! I loved the sound of whole wheat base and decided to go with one of their own vegetarian options. The pizza was ready in under 10 minutes and it was definitely one of the best pizza's I have had. Perfect ingredients, super fresh and full of flavour! I loved the rustic type interior with hanging lightbulbs and a brick wall... Very cosy! They also have a help-yourself table full of chilli oils, flakes and parmesan cheese. No need to wait around, just grab it and go.The staff were all super friendly and price is very reasonable. Will definitely be returning :)"

/user_details?userid=XX2bzDWiIE5iWg-aspbdmQ,Salina C.,"Hamilton, Canada",4 star rating,The pizza here was so good. The slices were almost too thin because the toppings were not staying on as well. I love thin crust pizza though and their crust was thin and crispy! The ingredients were very fresh and of higher quality. The prices were decent.
/user_details?userid=HH5HzZJlUUmZDW_3xgHdkA,伯阳,"Waterloo, Canada",4 star rating,"The pizza this restaurant serves for the customers is different from what I usually have at general pizza restaurants. The name of the pizza I enjoyed is called Gigi. First, the thinness of the pizza is stunning, which makes the pizza pretty crispy. Second, there are wide range of pizza toppings at this restaurant.For example, the cook actually put a special kind of bacon on my pizza,and it is really tasty as it is similar to Chinese preserved meat.In a word, Pizzeria Bros is a worthwhile restaurant for pizza-lovers to visit."
/user_details?userid=dmKGEcF6BrnyFUUE--IigQ,Insanomania A.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,Good staff but the pizza is just terrible!   We asked for a goat cheese pizza and they were extremely stingy with the goat cheese portion ( I mean just charge me extra and put more cheese guys!).    We ordered 4 types of pizzas and 3 of them were pretty bad and one was okay.  Not sure why everyone is so fond with this pizza place.

/user_details?userid=6a5fa3fcQvF5a84USryiTw,Danny W.,"Centreville, VA",5 star rating,This is a make your own pizza type place. We went in hungry and just wanting some quick grub and what we got was super friendly service and amazing food. I went with my family and we all got different types of our individual pizza. I exchanged three pieces of my pizza for three other kinds so that I got to experience four different types of pizza. My favorites were the ones with pancetta and prosciutto and of course I found the one I made to be the best. Mmm that fresh goat cheese. My dad and brother got the honey beer and they raved about that so that might be something to try as well.
/user_details?userid=t6VLtA0AjzQ9SK5g9S2z7w,Napp Y.,"Garden Grove, CA",3 star rating,Overpriced for okay pizza. Same concept as stateside Blaze pizza and Pieology. A build your own except each topping cost $1. The cheese is placed over the toppings thus not fully cooking the meats and making it soggy. Friendly staff.

And the combo of their dough and red sauce with the salt level is the winning combination. Pizzas don't take more than 3 min but when we came it wasn't busy. The best part is it's a simple menu with specials and salads. Beverages to add. That's it. It's not a full blown Italian joint. So decision making is simple. My gripe was in addition to 10$ for a 10 inch thin crust pizza, you add $1 or $1.50 for every topping with hot is no more than 50 grams each max."

/user_details?userid=XfFowd4YzyWuRfrbtFCTkg,Ming P.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Great pizza and fast service on a weekend lunch! Their pizza is pretty amazing and cooked fast. It was probably done in less than a minute. As we finished paying and picking up some napkins and water, our pizza was already done. Wow!You can start with the featured pizzas with fixed items on the pizza or go a la carte to choose your own ingredients. $1 for classic items and $1.75 for more ""deluxe"" items like prosciutto. We started with their fixed fungi pizza and customized on top of that. The guy who made our pizza explained things really well too. They also have whole wheat dough for the more conscious healthy minds. We opted for the whole wheat dough too. My wife and I share the pizza and an arugula salad. They both taste great! Will be back for sure whenever we visit Montreal again.When you pay with the machine, you will be presented with the option of 5%, 10%, 15%, or no tips. Given it is really more a self serve restaurant, I think you are OK if you decide to not give a tip. We gave a 10% tip just because it was our first time and the guy was very friendly and patient to go thru with us how the whole process was supposed to work."
/user_details?userid=xCVB2JqjrDsiHyFckMACrg,Jordan B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent experience overall. They had a small rush but the service was slow -- waited in line about 15 minutes, 5 of which was because the person assembling the pizzas was out of tomato sauce. They were hand-tossing the dough to order, and the pizza ovens looked suitably Italian, which was a plus. Pizza was good but not great -- Nepolitan style crust was not bad. Likewise for the salads; Caesar tasted a bit off -- the dressing tasted like it contained mustard. Glass of red wine for CAD $6 was very good for the price. Solid and inexpensive option but not memorable."
/user_details?userid=ioAkEN5vP5Gl1AC2jNWFGA,Erin G.,"Fox Lake, IL",5 star rating,"This place was so great. I was one of three French teachers from Chicago with a group of 20 students who were stuck in Montréal over night due to a cancelled flight. This place accommodated our group so well. Kids were happy and had lots of choices, and these guys really make pizzas fast!! Staff was friendly and helpful in getting us through the line and helped coordinate enough seating for everyone. They even asked us (the teachers) if we wanted the kids to order in French. So grateful! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Montréal!"
/user_details?userid=FypV0HRKFErfUO8mpsECfg,Greg N.,"Lenexa, KS",4 star rating,"Solid pizza, we were a bit surprised just how good it was... Yes, it is a little over priced but you are right down the street from the basilica so I am guessing rent just might be a bit higher... Totally worth it if you need a quick bite... Please add honey to dip the crusts!"
/user_details?userid=ClqHTL22D-mOVbuk1Bhenw,M W.,"Elmhurst, NY",5 star rating,"One of the best pizzas we've ever had. Choices are endless and so worth the money. Order their specialty pizzas or be adventurous and make your own, I guarantee you'll love it. We ordered different base sauces and toppings and shared slices. The person manning the dough was very accommodating and readily explained how things work.  Service was quick, easy and friendly.  We're from NYC and will definitely drop by this place when we visit Montreal again."
/user_details?userid=zHBJPRpO83mBf_JjC7eo8A,Anne W.,"SC, SC",5 star rating,"Incredibly friendly staff. Answered all of our questions and gave suggestions. I also liked the different choices in dough- traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free. I opted for the Greco (feta, olives, spinach, tomato) on whole wheat. Cost $13 and was ready in less than 5 minutes. Thin crust and was perfectly sized for 1 person."

/user_details?userid=xtDJJLvipvRkM6ZxY0Fz3Q,Emily A.,"Troy, NY",4 star rating,"Our last night in Montreal, we'd eaten an early dinner, but found ourselves hungry later in the evening. Pizzeria Bros was literally downstairs from our Airbnb, so we called and ordered a big spinach-pecan salad and a dessert pizza with nutella and mascarpone. 20 minutes later we were tucking into a delicious salad, which after 2 days of booze and poutine, we desperately needed. The dessert pizza, though... good god, that pizza. It was crispy and warm, and after spreading the mascarpone around to mix with the nutella, it was heaven. Not sure what their regular pizza is like (and I've heard that pizza in Montreal is generally not great) but I'd bet it's decent if the dessert pizza is anything to go by."

It was literally like 2 minutes wait time. The only problem is that the pizza crusts are SUPER thin, and it makes it hard and messy to eat the pizza. The plus side on this though, is that eating the full pizza won't make you full, so you can enjoy it! I say that this is a place you DEFINITELY want to try! Bon appetit!"

We weren't sure what we'll find. What we found was delicious, satisfying, well priced pizzas in under 5mins. You could get creative and make your own or if you're tired there are some options that you can choose from. Husband went for the Al-Funghi and I went crazy with a double cheese, extra garlic tomatoe-y pizza. Both on wholewheat which tasted delicious. We had both with drinks for 30$. This included leftovers for the next day. We patted ourselves on the shoulder for stumbling onto this place completely by accident. We're definitely going to be stumbling in again!"

/user_details?userid=ims1YNqRAQMhu_jg4Eu6wQ,C T.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",5 star rating,"Stopped in this place to get out of the cold. We really weren't hungry, but thought we should get a couple pizzas as we wanted to stay inside to warm up. They only have personal size pizzas. Being a pizza snob from NY/NJ, I had low expectations. Made to order, had to choose my dough type, sauce type, and toppings. Went for traditional ingredients. A few minutes later, boom, pizzas.....Wow were they excellent! I'm a thin crust guy....Check. Just enough burn on the crust....check. Flavorful sauce and correct amount of Mozz....check. Cheese and spices to add. Friendly service....What else could you ask for? Unless you like thick, or non traditional ingredients.....(Sorry Chicago and California :). Can't go wrong here."

Ordered the salsicchia pizza and a side garden salad. Pizza was amazing! Crust was chewy, perfect thickness, sauce and toppings were delicious.  Side salad is a typical old school Italian side salad, really fresh and tasty. Was only visiting Montréal, but would go here again next time I'm in the city."

Their crusts are thin and perfect. The are not paper thin or cracker toasty. The base tomato sauce is well seasoned. They have a good selection of toppings, however, when we went they did not have fresh mozzarella... This was disappointing to me. Nonetheless, I was impressed that they offered nice condiments, including chili oil ""olio santo."" Very tasty pizza and numerous possibilities to create your own winner pizza! Plus, they are reasonably priced gourmet pizzas."

They have a healthier option with whole wheat dough and also an option for those that are gluten intolerant. The second most important part of a pizza, the sauce, is perfect. I usually don't include pricing in my judgement but this time I shall cause I think it's a little much for what you're getting. Been here a few times already and very pleased with their pizza. Highly recommended"
