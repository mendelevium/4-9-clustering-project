/user_details?userid=PttfC3pZveKAF4YIOFsGWg,Jenna P.,"Derry, NH",5 star rating,"Yes. You want to go here.This was our first 5 star experience during our visit to Montreal and we have been here for days eating out for every meal (as tourists do). Our waiter was very professional and the menu was the perfect length of choices, but not overwhelming. The restaurant was packed on a Thursday evening and filled with an older crowd which signaled to us right away that this must be a good restaurant filled with regulars. The meals did not disappoint. The lemon veal dish was spectacular as was the chicken Parmesan. My only comment may be that a man may not be full after the lemon veal dish like I was since the veal is paper thin. The flavors on each dish were exciting and enjoyable from beginning to end!"
/user_details?userid=_Ntg87ugjBw6IFy29_EGqg,Gino B.,"Montréal-Nord, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a genuinely pleasant, cozy and quaint Italian restaurant in the downtown core. The service is pleasant, nice ambiance enabling conversation and the food was above average.We came here for a quick meal and enjoyed it immensely. I started with a mixed salad with tomatoes with olive oil and vinegar dressing. For the main I kept it simple and had a bowl of raviolini filled with beef in a nice, simple tomatoes sauce. I was very satisfied. They have the usual type of Italian dishes on the menu. I would recommend this place if you want a good Italian meal and at a very reasonable price."
/user_details?userid=lyxvWcFLoho5AB_GzZmdhw,Emily D.,"Norwalk, CT",4 star rating,"A lot of research was put into this dinner. I wanted something a tad fancy, delicious and not crazy expensive. It also had to be close to the tourism center since an evening tour of Montreal was booked for afterwards (from here to the center, it's an easy three minute walk). Despite some construction in the area, this restaurant was easy to find while walking around. Once inside, I was bummed to discover they didn't have a bar and there were only tables, but not a deal-breaker by any means. The menu is pretty extensive and it was hard to pick just one thing. Also, side note, all of their meat dishes were veal, not chicken, in the states you usually have the option and I was embarrassed to ask so I just went with a lovely pasta dish, penne Romanoff, minus the mushrooms. I appreciated that they let you slightly tweak their recipes, like leaving off the mushrooms, it made my meal perfect for me. My dish had a red/pink vodka sauce, which made it a tad sweet and delicious. The portion size was more than enough and I couldn't finish everything on my plate. My complaint, which is a personal preference, is that I wish my dish came with more sauce. I love any good sauce and the more the better. Rather than ask for more sauce, I decided that I had devoured more than enough and left some room for dessert. For dessert, their chocolate mousse is creamy, delicious and comes in a mini mason jar. It would have been nice to add a tad bit of whipped cream or maybe a strawberry or two for extra presentation points, but it was still very good. My overall thought is that this is a perfect everyday restaurant. It's slightly laid back and casual. The food is solid and I see why people like it. For the evening, I personally wanted something a little more fancy, but that's my fault, not theirs. Rating from 7/13/19 at 6:30 pmEntrees: 4 stars, solid, delicious, and the portions are largeDesert: 3.5 stars, while sweet and tasty the presentation could have been enhancedDrinks: 4 stars, the selected Pinot Grigio was delicious and fairly priced. I enjoyed a few glasses. Atmosphere: 4 stars, when you are looking for a slightly more casual meal"

Would definitely return again!We started off with the eggplant appetizer. It was covered in a delicious layer of mozzarella and had great seasoning. I ordered the veal Parmesan. Let me tell you, this was the best veal parm I have ever had! Perfectly seasoned veal with tasty cheese - i would highly recommend this dish to anyone! It was paired with perfect executed al dente spaghetti with delicious meat sauce.My wife ordered the manicotti dish. She felt it was executed well and tasted good. It just paled in comparison to my dish. In fact, she advised that we will be returning to this restaurant so that she can order the veal parm. Desert was wonderful. I had the carrot cake which was done well. My wife had tiramisu, which was the best she ever had. We capped off the evening with a cappuccino and earl grey tea. Overall, this was a wonderful restaurant with great tasting food. The service was great as well and they were able to accommodate us with our 2 year old daughter. Would definitely return!"

It is on the small side but it never got too loud. You could see them cooking in the dining room, which was really cool. They have an extensive wine list and we ordered escargot and fried calamari for spps and ot was all delicious.  Then came the entrees! Eggplant parm (from the appetizer menu - it was warm and satisfying), shrimp in tomato sauce (my son really enjoyed it), fettuccine alfredo (much lighter than in the us, and it was great) and a pasta with meat sauce (very filling) and it was all outstanding. My kids inhaled the tiramisu dessert and my husband really enjoyed the small pot of rich chocolate mousse. It was a pleasant dining experience and our waiter was superb. The next time we are looking for traditional Italian, we will definately come back here."

It was wonderful!As I passed the building looking for a place for lunch... I stopped, turned back and noticed it was filled with locals on their lunch break. So why not!The Italian restaurant had a 3-course lunch menu and we selected it. An appetizer, main dish, dessert and coffee for a reasonable reason. Couldn't  beat that!I ordered their antipasto... proscuitto with melon, tomato with fresh mozzarella and salmon with onions and capers. Small but wonderfully light and tasty.  For the main course, I selected a penne with riotti. Loved it! My cousin enjoyed the minestrone. A first for him! He selected a chicken dish with a side of pasta. Looked delicious! We each selected a custard which was a light flan. Quite good! Topped our lunch with an expresso. We were the last to leave enjoying our meal. And off we dashed to the closing session of the conference."
/user_details?userid=ElvZiBpFMVqoZSXBBYu9VQ,Erik H.,"Denver, CO",4 star rating,"I don't know if the taste of the food outweighs the quality of service. I want to say it does and that it may have only been an issue because it was a game night (the Montreal Canadiens).When we arrived and asked for a table, the waiter that greeted us immediately said no. Then asked if we had a reservation. And then walked away. I thought he might have been going to check with someone, but it also looked like he went back to work. Shortly thereafter, another gentleman approached and began seating us. He did note that he would need the table by 7:00 which was no issue at. That was almost 2 hours from when we arrived.The man that initially told us no was then our waiter. And he only seemed frustrated and put off by having to serve us. He was rude, short, and put off with us the entire time we were there and more so when we had to interact with him. Every request we had (bread, water, etc) was either ignored or delayed. The restaurant began filling up quickly. And getting louder. Hockey jerseys everywhere. We saw another couple almost get turned away like we did by the same man, until again the other gentleman arrived and seated them as well. The food was a little slower coming out. However when it arrived it was amazing. Fresh pepper and cheese. Spectacular pastas and the minestrone soup was incredible. I very much enjoyed the food and think that any other non-game night might have been better.The restaurant doesn't open until 5pm, however. So any might there is a match, I believe the service and speed would be competence to what we received.I would definitely check before hand and/or make a reservation IF I were ever to go again."

The Chicken Marsala was cooked perfectly and my girlfriend loved her seafood pasta. It came with a delicious creamy sauce and pasta on the side. Looks fancy but we wore our casual attire. Easy to find, plenty of parking. We were really hungry and it was just the right amount of food after a long hot day of visiting  Montreal and just snacking. Server was quick and on point. Wine was fantastic and ambiance was serene. Perfect way to end my sweethearts birthday"
/user_details?userid=nu6b6GpbSMXeQeE-u4sf0A,Alan A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,After a week of eating French food and pub fare I was in the mood for some Italian food. After reviewing the local offerings on Yelp we decided to go to Café Bistro La Marinara. After a short walk from our hotel we found the place. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated.Our waiter was very attentive and brought our drinks out while we looked over the menu. We were both in the mood for veal. I ordered the scallopini and my wife had the veal parm and spaghetti. Each main course came with a salad which was also very good. The bread on the table was warm and was good with the wine and salad while we waited for our main course. The veal was properly prepared and was tender enough to cut with a fork. The pasta was a perfect al dente.If we lived in the area I could see making this my go to Italian restaurant. If you're visiting Montreal give them a try. I'm glad I did!

We were so thankful to find this tasteful Italian restaurant in Centre Ville on Yelp. Our server spoke minimal English but was attentive without us having to wait too long in between courses. We began our experience by letting our server know that we were famished and he promptly brought us 2 orders of chicken wings. I thought this would be weird in an Italian restaurant but it was actually delicious. Chianti Is served by the glass as well as beer and some cocktails.I had the Caesar Salad as a starter and it came with a nice light dressing with crispy lettuce and homemade baguette croutons. There were 3 of us so we ordered the lasagna, fettuccine and papalina (penne with tomato sauce). I loved the lasagna the best but gobbled every bite of my own pasta with a rich creamy sauce with fresh button mushrooms and ham. You've got to try the Tiramisu, I thought it was one of the best I've had. Pair it with a Cappuccino and you've got a PERFECT end to a day in Montreal."

We tried the seafood linguini, lasagna and calamari.  Tomato sauce was rich and perfectly balanced--no acidity.  The linguini was cooked perfectly--al dente.  Seafood items were plentiful..clams, mussels. The bread that came with the meal was fresh with the right amount of chew.  Service was les than stellar..we arrived at 8:30 to a pretty full restaurant. Our starter calamari was brought out with our mains.. our waiter was MIA for most of our meal and when he did appear was intent on rushing us through our meal."

It was offered in a red sauce or light (natural sauce). I chose the natural sauce. It had a wonderful medley of shrimp, clams, mussels, calimari. It was prepared in a light amount of garlic and was really tasty!  My wife ordered the small plate version of Penne Arribiatta and daughters shared a regular regular spaghetti meat sauce.  Wife mentioned the Arribiatta was very good, not wonderful, not bad and daughters were very happy with the spaghetti! When I was finishing my dish one of the chefs asked if I would like some more. I clearly thanked him but said it was fine. Rarely am I offered this! Wow! The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side but this made it more cosy. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely return!"

Braved the cold 20-degrees and carried it all the way back to my hotel room. Still arrived piping hot. Ordered the veal parm with spaghetti and caesars salad. Salad was crisp, lightly seasoned. The veal parm was still warm, felt like they just made it as I arrived for pickup. Veal was tender and succulent. Very happy with the texture, and seasoning. However the sauce was a little bland. Only negative I could find. The thin spaghetti was al dente, maybe a touch undercooked. But I ate it and was somewhat satisfied. Overall, for my first Italian take out in Montreal I came away satisfied. But I'm still on the lookout for ""my go to"" Italian spot the next time I'm in town for business."

We thought with the reviews that it would be a really good experience. Unfortunately it wasn't. I ordered the carbonara and it was very bland. I actually had to add salt which, when a meal is seasoned well, one should not have to do. My friend's lasagna was just mediocre and for the price, we expected a lot more. Most pasta dishes are around $20 so for that price, the flavours should be exceptional. Also, there wasn't a full wine menu, so we just asked for a glass of the house wine and we were charged $10 each for a very small glass. The service was okay, and they were pretty quick (maybe that's why the flavours weren't out of this world... ) and they were polite. I would rather have gone to the small little mom & pop resto that we passed as we left this resto. Oh well, live & learn."

I did not make a reservation and had to wait roughly 10 minutes to be seated. That was not bad but the server forgot that we checked in and kept on telling us to wait. Then, my guest and I sat down and ordered food. We ended up sharing an entree since neither of us were very hungry. There was hardly any food on each plate but the food that was there was pretty good. The really annoying part was when we got the check. The waiter charged each of us $15 for an $18 entree (so a total of $30) since we were sharing. He said that it was restaurant policy but failed to share that information with us before we ordered. So we basically spent $30 on an entree that should have only cost $18. Very upset that the server did not tell us this and I do not think I will return again."

Once I found it and walked in I liked the ambience. Tablecloths and quiet recorded jazz in the background. The menu had lots of great sounding Italian food. I had the fish of the day which was excellent cod. I had my choice of a red or a white sauce. I went for the tomato and garlic which was wonderful. I had my choice of pasta or vegetables with the cod and I chose vegetables. There was a nice assortment and they were not overcooked. My sweetie had the manicotti which she declared the best she had in years. It had some spinach and excellent cheese. Plus some good added parmesan on top. There was excellent bread while we waited, served with butter that was too cold to properly spread. I had the green salad with a very good oil and vinegar dressing plus a nice selection of lettuce tomatoes and more. We each had a glass of the house white wine which was not sweet and thus very good.

Prices are fine during lunch (I noticed the dinner menu seems more expensive). I had their spaghetti with tomato sauce. My colleagues tried everything else there was to try, mostly meals with pasta and cheese, and they thought it was really good. I remember that the soup was a little too salty, but otherwise the food was great and fresh. It's not too far from the La Gauchetiere. I think it's one of the few good restaurants close to work."

/user_details?userid=1wp5t7VQsRSj2qcVDPjzWw,Joseph T.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"My family and I were on vacation in Montreal. The food was delicious. Ask for the specials if you don't see a notice (small white paper) tucked in your menu. They will happily explain and translate the specials for you (that small paper is in French). The service was outstanding and very friendly. Small store front, but long inside and plenty of seating in back. No outdoor seating, very asked. They let you view the desserts too. No idea if they have WiFi inside. I would highly recommend this place if you're in this area of Montreal looking for good Italian cuisine."

/user_details?userid=-1Kz6O4zTiC9eeYlUXlnTQ,Rick H.,"Grand Haven Charter Township, MI",2 star rating,"Our first night in Montreal and went here around 6:00 without reservations.  Fortunately there were a number of empty tables (that changed within the next half hour as the restaurant filled shortly after we arrived).  We were seated immedtiately.  We had 2 servers, one was friendly and helpful, the other barely made eye contact.  Salads arrived shortly after we ordered and we're quite tasty.  Our meals were good, but not exceptional.  My veal with a cognac based sauce was good, but was light on the veal portion.  My wife's seafood pasta was one of the specials.  The seafood (clams and mussels) was bland. The wine selection was between a drinkable house red and 2 house whites (a nice pinit grigio).  Our major disappointment came after we were served when our servers never checked back on us.  Our dishes were cleared after we finish and we then sat for 20 minutes with our empty wine glasses (which had been empty about halfway through our meals).  We declined dessert when our server finally retuned."

/user_details?userid=exmR2SlGumB89QmNnnUyOg,Stephanie S.,"Athens, OH",3 star rating,"When ordering, I couldn't decide between penne vodka or Fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter said, ""No problem! I can put in a half order of each!"". Sounded great. Then I got the bill and realized he failed to mention it would be $7 extra for this.... Also I never once received a refill on my water which was my only beverage. Once we received our food, the waiter never came back until he brought the bill. The food was very good but service was not."

/user_details?userid=6nsBPqNyx-EYvOFNjtkgDw,F P.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",1 star rating,"Very disappointing . Food is average, I had an indigestion. And the service is very inappropriate: the waiter almost insulted us for asking the difference between the small and the big portion. And he is very awkward in general: he is there when you don't need him and when you do he is nowhere around!"
