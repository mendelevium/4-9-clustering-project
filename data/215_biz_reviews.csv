Lovely space, and even more lovely people working there.The food is jaw droopingly well executed, with (of course) local, seasonal ingredients. Sit at the bar and order a bottle of wine from their killer (of course) wine list, and chat a bit. This place just as a perfect vibe."

The service is also amazing, end to end attention, the plates are changed for every subsequent dish served at the table, which is wonderful as the specific tastes would not mix. For those craving a real authentic Pisco Sour, this is the place to have it in Montreal. The list of organic wines is great for exploration, we resorted to the help of our host for a delicious pinot noir. The menu changes continuously, even the flagship empanadas will be of different flavor on different days. We truly and happily indulged in Beba. The empanadas are must try. We also had the grilled octopus with white beans, this was an amazing surprise, followed by the gnocchi with ragu sauce, super delicious. Last but not least came the main dish of a whole fish and steamed clams, accompanied as per the recommendation of our host with an amazing winter salad. After all this food we were reluctant to have a dessert, but fortunately ended up ordering the the flan with dolce de leche and whipped cream. This was the perfect way to end the dinner, the flan was outstanding.Beba has a special vibe, it is a relatively small bistro like restaurant that should be more intimate, but in a matter of fact is somewhat noisy and full of energy. Hidden in Verdun, the resto is easy to reach by metro and parking is available around. Warmly recommended for those who like to celebrate life!"

Not only is the food and wine delicious, the service is great, and the ambiance is amazing! Tonight was my third visit and we let the chef take the reigns; we enjoyed the foie gras and goat cheese entree, the cheese and butternut squash, the spaghetti and beef ragu, and the fluke and mussels as a main. Everything was delicious. The pasta was especially fantastic; we loved the breadcrumbs in the sauce for texture. The suggested wine was perfectly paired and to our taste; also very affordable! We finished with tasty pear compote and flan for dessert; the dulce de lèche on the flan was so freaking yummy!! The service was great too! Staff was attentive, our glasses were always full and our feedback was always welcome. Definitely looking forward to going back!"

/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"TLDR: just go and enjoy every bit of your evening. Date night or group event, this is well worth the price. We booked a table for 12 for my birthday and they kindly accommodated with a group menu for $60 per person. At first I was a little cold about the fix menu and price but oh was I wrong.We were seated 5 minutes after our arrival. The restaurant probably holds 25 places in total so we were taking up much of the space. Open kitchen and bar.I started off with a negroni sbagliato. Sbagliato means wrong, as it was originally created in error. This negroni is different than a regular one because it does not include gin but has champagne instead.Our table also shared 2 bottles of organic raw wine recommended by the waiter. Great pairing. They have a short list of Harricana microbrewery beer, which is nice. The raspberry one is very refreshing.The group menu was composed of everything of their menu, in sharing platters. I can't begin to describe how amazing the food was. Each of the 5 services was perfect. My favourite plates were the beer rib, so juicy and tender, with chimichurri spicy sauce & the creamy polenta with corn and mushrooms. All the other plates were as amazing and I even forgot to take a picture of the raspberry and almond clafoutis dessert. The owner was waiting our table and took care of us very well. They knew it was my birthday so they even lit a candle for me. Nice attention.I appreciated every minute of my evening."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"While I call Pointe-St-Charles home, I am lucky enough to be close by from Verdun and the booming restaurant scene that is developing along Wellington street. As that neighbourhood has changed and developed, we have seen more and more interesting restaurants establish roots in the area that have some great pedigrees. Most recently, we have the case of Beba, a restaurant on Ethel - just off Wellington - that was started by the Schor brothers, Pablo and Chef Ari, who have some great bonafides including the fact that Chef Ari was Chef de Cuisine at Liverpool House prior to opening this restaurant. With a pedigree like this, I couldn't wait to walk over and see what they had in store for us so I called my sister who lives in Verdun and she joined my wife and I for a nice evening dinner.Beba has the look of a real neighbourhood bistro. The interior is very clean with simple modern touches such as the marble countertop bar, the circular mirrors along the wall and leather mid-century style banquettes. There is also a garage door on the side which allows to really open up the space in the summer. They also have a nice little terrasse in the front which faces Ethel street which makes it very calm and relaxing as a spot. The weather was so beautiful that night that we got a chance to sit outside for our meal - perfect conditions to enjoy a hopefully great meal.Beba advertises itself as serving 'food and drink inspired by the Spanish and Italian cultures that settled in Argentina' which is an interesting premise and a big difference from the Liverpool House fare that people know chef Schor for but one that reflect he and his brother's Argentinian heritage. The three of us decided to share a bunch of different items from the menu. The menu is apparently adjusted frequently so it is subject to change.First up, we had the beef and olive empanada. A classic Argentine item - a nice flaky crunch to the pastry shell and the interior filing was quite flavourful. More beer in flavour than olive which I appreciated immensely.Next was the Swiss chard involtini with zucchini, pine nuts and yogourt. An interesting presentation and usage of Swiss chard. Very flavourful dish - I enjoyed the freshness of the veggies and how that paired with the creaminess of the yogourt.Our final starter was the green salad served with egg, summer vegetables and grana padano. A very simple dish in presentation but a perfect usage of the seasonable veggies available,. This was a beautifully fresh salad with a nice balance of acidity, sweetness and some richness. I rarely order a green salad at a restaurant but this one was well worth it.We moved to the 'bigger' dishes of the night and started the gnudi with tomato butter and pecorino. This was the biggest hit of the night. The gnudi were light and fluffy in texture with a lovely creamy rich flavour. The tomato butter was insane - so smooth and rich of flavour. The pecorino provided some bite to the dish. We lapped this up and I would go back to Beba just for this dish. Next was the eggplant served with a lamb ragu and peas. I really enjoyed this dish - the star is the hearty lamb ragu which had tons of that gamey richness that I love about lamb. The eggplant was good but somewhat hidden by the strong notes of the ragu. The peas provided some crispness and the little sauce a little acidity and brightness to the plate. A solid dish all around.Our final dish was the rabbit 'pan con tomate' served with an aioli and a mussel escabeche. I loved the different usage of the classic spanish 'pan con tomate' dish to serve the rabbit. The garlicky aioli with the tomatoes, the mussels and the rabbit paired very nicely together. The rabbit itself was excellent - the one complaint is more of the presentation one. By having the rabbit pieces still on the bones, it made it more of the hassle to enjoy the rabbit with the tomato bread itself which meant that the dish was eaten more in two parts then all together. The flavours were excellent outside of that minor complaint.All in all, Beba was an excellent experience from beginning to end and is a welcomed neighbourhood spot close to home. The dishes were delicious. The service was sharp and friendly; and the atmosphere was a perfect combination of hip energy with a relaxed neighbourhood haunt vibe. Chef Schor and his brother have a really interesting thing going very quickly. I look forward to more walks over for some good meals and hope you shall all join me.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=yuC7UbekzcZhMqNrUqsxTw,Bob F.,"Enola, PA",5 star rating,"Wonderful, vibrant, delicious food with terrific service. Described as a mix of Argentinian, Italian, Spanish, and local/seasonal Quebecoise with an emphasis on shared plates - Beba definitely lived up to that and more. Every plate we tried was incredibly delicious. The vegetable starters were all very flavorful and we'll executed, while the seafood (bass and mussels) and meat (rabbit) were terrific. Highly recommend."
