/user_details?userid=rld4U_k0IheJTHkz99FIyg,Ian J.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I was the only guest at 8pm on a Tue - but when the food came out 5 mins after ordering, it was excellent. Other points:1. My entree was $12 but they wanted cash - bring cash2. These people are great cooks first - if the reception seems cold at first when you walk in speaking English, ignore it. They're not really selling - they're just real.3. This is the first time I opened a fortune cookie to find it empty. That freaked me out. My gf says it means I now get to write my own fortune. I don't know, sounds like something Jules would tell Vince in that breakfast scene in Pulp Fiction."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. I really didn't expect it to be anything out of ordinary at first, but it was a nice dinner experience. The service was friendly and quick. Their menu has more to offer than just your regular Pho and I've ordered their crispy noodles to try. The portions are generous, simple and delicious and very cheap considering quality/price ratio. It's worth going there for lunch or dinner."
/user_details?userid=S6eQVCxaLKRUlDNhA99UHw,Gina G.,"Vernon, CT",4 star rating,"This place was open today! Great food and the owner was very attentive. I have to say their pho needed to have less noodles and be hotter. They could also improve on their lemongrass chicken, it was just 3 pieces on top of rice. I really like the ambience here and how friendly the staff were. So i would come here again"
/user_details?userid=wU5_qDZWCWVOnB8wU1rAVQ,Desmond T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2 star rating,"Dropped by in the middle of a hot afternoon and it was empty. But that's no excuse for the subpar service - oops I meant complete lack of service we received. The one server was clearly more interested in singing his karaoke than serving his customers, with his face plastered to his phone's YouTube all the way. Food wise tasted average at best, though their selection of noodles wasn't that bad."
/user_details?userid=9NQTlXeD4LpYqx7_MAfAdQ,John A.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a gem! It's quiet, with professional service and very good food. I have been here three times over many years and the quality is still as good as my first visit."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After reading a couple reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try. It was about 12:45 so still lunchtime right? I asked myself why was i the only person there. Shouldn't it be more busy since they are right next to Place Dupuis and other offices. Plus their prices are quote reasonable. Anyways, i always try before I judge. Ok. So this is not the best pho in town but not the worst. Especially around this part of town. So i ordered two lunch specials to go. Sorry no pictures this time. I ordered the rare and well done beef pho that came with two imperial rolls. I also ordered the Hu tieu that came with a spring roll. All that for 20$. Not bad! Here it goes. The both broth were ok since you can taste the msg quite a bit. Not too overwhelming but just enough to know that they went a big overboard! The imperial roll could of been better if they hadn't been fried in old oil. The spring roll was nothing to die for. They were generous with the meat portions in the soups so that's good. Would i return to this restaurant? Maybe. I will need to try some other vietnamese/pho places around here..."
/user_details?userid=F5P_YyFeucqKu00lmJJHIg,Steve S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is not a fancy place but this is a tasty place ! The service was quick and friendly. The menu has the traditional Vietnamese favourites including Bun Bo Hue... Yes I must be back for the Bun Bo Hue! This time around I had the beef pho and it was absolutely delicious. The broth was fragrant and right up there with the bettor pho's in town. This could quickly become one of my faves for lunch since it is walking distance from my work.
/user_details?userid=MgRofa2-Gn1znhncOiMZ7Q,Jim S.,"Niagara Falls, Canada",5 star rating,"Tasty, simple food.  Quick service, good price, nice little place.And Yelp is ridiculous in that it won't let me post a short review. If I don't want to write a long winded review I should not be forced to!"
/user_details?userid=WKGgo72Z5dNZxifSV53Wsg,SzeYun L.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"My Beau dragged me to this little restaurant that seemed to be tucked away in the middle of nowhere. Ok~ maybe it's not in the middle of nowhere and I'm just saying that because he dragged me there at night. We had just landed in from Toronto and needed a place to eat and it was getting late and thank goodness this place was still open!It's really shady in the area at night as we passed a few zombies (if you know what I mean) to get to this restaurant. The streets aren't that brightly lit around the area either. Inside behind the double doors of this restaurant was a night get away from the chill of the winter. The place seemed clean and well kept.There wasn't anyone else but us in the restaurant but it was around 9pm, an odd hour to eat dinner. They didn't serve the three bean drink at this restaurant -  I always get at Pho places. Maybe they do have it but I just didn't order it right. But the server did apologize and say that didn't have it.The Pho here was so good! Better that some I tried in Chinatown. Boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken pho and feels this place had the best chicken pho broth he had ever had. The server was quiet, but was nice and pretty keen on making sure we had enough tea. I left very happy after dinner here ~ even if I didn't get my rainbow coconut drink."
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've ordered a bowl of Pho for takeout. Not the best but enough for me to enjoy a warm soup during winter. Waited 15 min. for my order...might want to call them beforehand. Overall, it is a decent place. Staff are friendly. If you find yourself in this area and want a warm bowl of soup, give this place a try as this is the only pho place I believe."
/user_details?userid=LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg,Kathy H.,Hong Kong,3 star rating,"Oh no! Is this really the best pho in town? I do like this restaurant! However it's only a 3 star for me. The soup is nice but bland, the noodles are just acceptable. Many lunch combos available. Many rice and non-soup dishes too. I find the food to have a Western taste palette.Wonderful staff!!!!! Great prices. Quick service."
/user_details?userid=P73_DQhYI6Oe5X3PZ1PBOg,Bonnie B.,"San Rafael, CA",2 star rating,"Very welcoming staff. Generic, basement atmosphere with fluorescent lighting. Mediocre Pho Ga and spring rolls. Walked all over town to find the best OPEN Pho shop. Yelp reviews let me down."
/user_details?userid=1nBWI8Y0AGK8-dk-Rjp8OQ,Erika T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We loved this place! Excellent food, excellent value. Starter was one of the best pho soups I have ever had, absolutely delicious. Followed that with perfect grilled chicken in a lemongrass sauce over vermicelli, spring roll and salad on the side. Cookie to finish up. All of that for $10.50. And the owner is super nice. The place is actually open to 10pm on weeknights, yelp says 9pm. We were very pleasantly surprised. We just recently moved in across the street and will be back soon and often! Found our new go-to spot in our new neighbourhood :)"
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The music that's playing is amazing. I have no idea what's even happening. It sounds like sped up Karaoke. I think the CD they have is scratched. The pho was pretty damn decent, and I'm not even that hungry. Really just killing time. Solid broth. Good all around pho. And the prices were great for what you get. Fun fact: I actually wrote this before I even ate the food. I just had a hunch, then ate, then pressed ""continue."" When you know, you know."
/user_details?userid=k-82cM-TOKzEGBh5OQmZEw,Leticia S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great food, homey warm vibes, the portions are big! So if you don't very much (like me) take the small sized soup! Great for eating alone or with friends."
/user_details?userid=SBU4NJYTTgeWmtlHSl5zzg,Sylvester A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Afyer reading the reviews, I was expecting food to be great but sadly no. It was Bland at best."
/user_details?userid=etI6YOPhiIaud7yMXg3f8A,Bianca B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food was great! I hard the shrimp Tom Yum soup, which was delicious. Prices are great, most items are under 10$ and the plates will fill you up quickly!"
/user_details?userid=WpGMjLBKUlrjR3jTkNr8uw,Ralph S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,This is the worst pho restaurant I've been to.   The broth was disgusting and the noodles were old. Will definitely not recommend.  Not sure how this place has a 4 1/2 star rating... I
/user_details?userid=oQe-9ubVGS5QB8n8KOpIHw,Jennifer N.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious traditional Vietnamese food. The tastiest Phô ever! A friendly staff/family that has everything homemade. Absolutely LOVE their springrolls with the peanut sauce!
/user_details?userid=QlASYP_tOznDYnrq9Cm1kA,Sally S.,"Derry, NH",5 star rating,"I loved the pho here! Out of all the restaurants I visited in Montreal this past weekend, this one had the best food. I did not know it was cash only (I used my credit card all weekend) and all I had was a $100 bill american and the guy was nice enough to take it and give me a fair exchange rate. The pho was tasty (I got #26) and the service was great."
/user_details?userid=GyeiGtM3wrXhWi_Eqsn2CA,Tommy O.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"oh mine... We read Hoang-Khai review, but we were still a bit skeptical about this restaurant, but decided to give it a try.  It was a warm family restaurant, definitely not a chic restaurant for sure.  The food are DELICIOUS and AWESOME.  Ultra fresh ingredient.  Not much MSG, but good food.  Price is great, under $10 for most on the menu."
