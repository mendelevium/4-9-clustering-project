It's dark with candles everywhere, leather booths with rich woods.The bathroom downstairs carry's out the theme of the restaurant it's great. Canadian Old fashions are my favorite drink that they make they have dark cherry and it taste like heaven. It's a must try.Always happy to come here"
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Crafty cocktails and warm upscale-pub atmosphere. I love the interior of the Dominion. The lighting and decor are exactly what you would want for a semi-formal meal. My group of three was first seated at a table that was squeezed between the entrance and door to the downstairs restroom. It felt very awkward there; like sitting on the back of an airplane near the restroom doors (lots of people scooting around and no privacy). Luckily, the service was very understanding of our discomfort and moved my table to a booth that was open. The cocktails were excellent! I don't have any major complaints about my dishes, nor do I have any major praise. There is only one vegetarian main dish. In this day and age, many groups are limited by their most restrictive friend. That being said, I still love to eat seafood and meat but it's disappointing to go out somewhere new with vegetarian friends who end up having to order sides for a meal. I took down one star for the lack of vegetarian options and just average ""upscale"" dishes. Overall, I'd go back to the Dominion for the atmosphere, cocktails and kind service staff. I couldn't recommend it at the drop of a hat because many of my friends and family have some dietary restrictions."

We both had the same braised beef dish, because our server said it was the best dish on the menu.  We had the  deviled eggs, and the white fish croquettes to start.Place is super cute, open till 12 on Sundays. Had a relaxed  vibe and some awesome cocktails although I wasn't drinking.. but the cocktail menu and spirit list looked amazing. Can't wait to come back and actually try to drinks!"

I tried Gravlax de Salmon which was one crape with smoked salmon, preserves and a little bit of sour cream on the side, very unique taste, you should not miss it, though it's an appetizer and not that filling. My friends had fish and chips and salmon entre and both were happy. The restaurant offers daily specials as well. sticky toffee pudding is a must, it comes warm with the melted caramel and an ice cream on the side and melts in your mouth.Overall. It's was a good experience the location was very central, will come back!"
/user_details?userid=71p7Qmz3PNjfrMqpAzgK3Q,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"When I go on vacation I like to have one meal where I pretend to be rich! I treat myself to a fancy meal. For my fancy Montreal meal, I picked ""Dominion Square Tavern"". I arrived only 8 minutes before the restaurant opened. People by that time started lining up behind me. When people show up the minute a place opens,  then you know it's gonna be good. It's off the main street and only regulars were showing up. I was the first person in. The place looked so beautiful empty, greeting you with open arms. I was asked if I had a reservation. I did not. They were able to accommodate me with a bar seat for an hour and a half. Make a Reservation!!! I still scored a pretty great ledge spot with only one other person sitting to my left. The service here is phenomenal. They greeted me with water and explained the menu. They made me feel very welcomed. I ordered the fish croquette and a Sazerac. I noticed in my time in Montreal that they love simple classic cocktails and I'm insanely into it. My croquettes came crispy, wedges of lime brought the brightness and the tarragon aioli was the creamy decadence to finish the bite. My Sazerac had that perfect hint of absinthe. The cocktail was chilled in a shaker and served without ice. I was one happy camper. The mussels I ordered came out in a giant bowl covered in another bowl. The top bowl is removed and the aromas of the mussels and cider come flying out. I was happy they were able to accommodate me and make the mussels without the bacon. The top bowl served as my empty shells bowl. The side of fries were the best accompaniment to my mussels. The crispy potatoes dipped into that flavorful broth. Heavenly! I seriously wasn't sure I was going to make it to end of the bowl. The gentleman next to me ordered a gin and tonic. I overheard the gin was local and the tonic was made in house. Sign me up! I love gin. And a perfectly made one is irresistible. Tonic is made with special kind of bark. And if you think about it, a great complement to the busy herbaceous and fresh flavors of gin. I made it to bottom of the bowl. Had to leave some fries behind. But it was all worth it. The meal was a complete success! I enjoyed every morsel and felt like a queen. Life is short and treating yourself is a must in my book. On a historical side note, I am very pleased that in 1988 the law was revoked to keep this place men only! Women are more than happy to splurge on good food and tasty cocktails."
/user_details?userid=gtfmB4IBpZ670wOtMJBA-Q,Lisa W.,"Durham, NC",5 star rating,"Recommended by a local guide (spade and palacio tours) this restaurant ended up being our favorite place we dined while visiting Montreal. Atmosphere, service, cocktails, appetizers, and desserts were all to the nines. Well rounded menu so everyone in your party will find something they like. Prices are a bit higher but the quality is worth the price tag. You can easily make a dinner out of two appetizers for a lighter meal to save room for dessert! We will dine here again when in town and highly recommend them for a fancy-ish night out."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Looking for a pint in DTMTL? All roads lead to Dominion Square Tavern.Dominion Square Tavern, or more properly said, Taverne Square Dominion has been at the forefront​ of​ Montréal's libation scene since 1927 and has been supplying​ the masses with​ ice-cold​​ mixers, beers (before they were ever ""craft""), and faithful pub fare ever since. Just walking into the establishment pushes you back in time and slows things down to an era when you actually​ wanted to talk to other patrons for a generalized form of entertainment. For better or worse - you are​ the judge. Fanboy transparency; I stopped because Anthony Bourdain did. Crucify me. From the tin roof to the original build bathrooms, this is the genuine​ article and a must stop for any newcomer to the city even if it is only once to imbibe on a frosty pint or vino off of their extensive list. Put down the cell phone (after your obligatory IG post, that is) and soak in the history that nearly 100 years provides. Hell, maybe even say hello to someone sitting nearby - you may be surprised with the result. I am sure a killjoy or AA member may counter with ""It is just a Bar"" but they are missing the magic available here for the cost of a single drink. They also offer a full menu by a dedicated kitchen but by this point in​ my trip,​ I already had a full dance card and no room for straying from strategy. I am sure you can find other reviews on the cuisine easily enough. Taverne Square Dominion provided a very memorable moment in a very memorable city. P.S. - Everyone in this city speaks English. Simply point out poor fashion sense and you will find out quickly. You are welcome in advance for this tip. ​"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place just hits all the right notes and makes me happy. Their homemade gin and tonics are ridiculously good. I could drink 2 litres of the stuff and then go roll around on the grass across the street. The tonic is not too sweet and tastes mildly of cucumber. It is dark pink in colour and just really refreshing.Recently I tried their charcuterie plate (large). I shouldn't be surprised that this was one of the wierder collections of meat I've ever seen. This is after all a British restaurant. I was in the mood for charcuterie which is a french word, hence french style. What was served didn't have the saltiness or chewy quality that a platter of french or italian meat would provide. Most of it tasted like thinly sliced deli meat. The green one was kind of weird and tasted like curry. I would go back to getting the bone marrow next time. It's one of the best in the city.I also tried the mussels and fries. These are some of the best prepared mussels I have tasted in a long while. They are very fresh and are served overflowing with thick chunks of deep red bacon. Served with great fries and mayonnaise, this dish hits every nerve in your brain's pleasure centers. Combined with the gin and tonics that keep arriving at my table (because I keep ordering them), this dish a good time.For dessert, I tried the treacle tart because it sounded weird and 9 times out of ten, I'll choose anything in pie form for dessert. After I ordered it, I looked up what treacle is and didn't get a clear answer other than to say it's sweet. The pie was really nice, but not spectacular. It tasted generically sweet, but ultimately it was forgettable. Again, they dress their desserts with plain sour cream and nutmeg. I didn't know this would be the case with this dessert and I would have requested they omit this given the opportunity. Sour cream doesn't work for me. It interferes with the sweetness of the dessert rather than complimenting it. Use some real whipped cream. It's tried and true and works for a reason.The vibe, lighting, and unique menu here are not to be missed."
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So my friend was working hard since early morning at a bar nearby and a group of us go to have drinks and catch up during his shift. Someone comes up with the brilliant idea of Dominion Square Tavern deviled eggs and before you know it, 6 of us all of a sudden have the same craving. They don't do delivery as they are a classy joint, which is fine, ok, but they do package up the remainders of your lunch or dinner, so they do have take away containers. We sent a friend over to sit at the bar, have a drink and then order some deviled eggs. He was going to eat a few and then bring the rest over to us. The waiter kiboshed that idea and said that we were breaking the take away rules. OK, you caught us, but given that a single deviled egg goes for 5$, you do the math: they just lost out on the easiest money they ever could have made on a quiet Sunday afternoon and instead left a lot of sad faced people deviled-eggless.Most in the service industry bend over backwards to make customers happy and I really do not think that the integrity of the place would have been compromised by walking some leftover eggs 2 blocks away.I see no reason to come back to this place given that the food is generally oversalted and the front hostess is almost always rude if you dare to show up sans reservation, even if the place is quiet. I want to love this place because the vibe and the décor are just plain awesome, but I cannot get over the hoity toity service and super rude hostess."

The folks here are nice and helpful and the place is just cool. We had their plentiful ploughman's meat plate (an assortment of their best cold dishes like potato salad, deviled egg, sausages). It was good. As was their tomato cottage cheese salad, esp on such a hot night. We had a big lunch so didn't sample more but certainly would've if we were hungrier."

The menu is simple and everything looked (and smelled) delicious. We started with the homemade charcuterie... amazing. I would have this again, for sure.For the mains, we went with the striploin and bangers and mash. I've yet to encounter a restaurant in England that serve blue cheese bangers, but they were tasty none the less. Not too overpowering on the blue cheese, but the gravy that it was served with had too much Worcestershire. The mash was good, but under seasoned, and no salt and pepper on the table. The beef was delicious, cooked perfectly, served with a butter and gravy, excellent. The drinks were strong, but not too strong, service was prompt, but our waiter spoke far too quietly, could barely hear him over the music and the voices of the other customers. All in all, had a very nice evening, but not the best meal I've ever had."

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, smoked trout and some cocktails. Our drinks were perfectly made; they sure know how to make a good Old Fashioned. The food was ridiculous, every bite was delicious. They're a busy spot on a Friday night and the servers were awesome even though they were super busy. It's a little pricey but totally worth it.I was happy we stayed, we left very content and I would definitely return."

/user_details?userid=kwjfwrE4Qs6ZblePxNeQcQ,Temenah C.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"We weren't planning to stop in here, but I wanted a cocktail and this place came up during my search. I liked the ambiance because it feels old-timey, like you took a step back in time or something. It's a large space too and it's wide open, which means it can get pretty loud. We sat at the bar and the bartender that helped us was great. He immediately gave us menus and allowed enough time for us to review them and make a choice. He also checked in on us regularly and even stopped to chat for a bit. The place was pretty busy so he didn't have time to just hang out, but I appreciated that he stopped to check in.We ordered a cheese plate and I loved that there was a pretty good sized selection of cheeses to choose from. We settled on a three cheese place and one of the options we chose was a coffee crusted cheese (I can't remember what kind it was). I know you'd never think coffee and cheese go together but this was just right. Everything about it was right. They had a Pimm's Cup on the menu and I tried it because I love Pimm's Cups and it was the best Pimm's Cup I ever had. Like, I almost downed this thing but I couldn't because there's alcohol (somewhat) in it and I didn't want to start my trip with a hangover. As I watched the bartenders make other cocktails I could tell these guys knew what they were doing. I appreciated that. Who doesn't love a bartender that can whip up a great handcrafted cocktail?Definitely on my ""To Visit Again"" list."

The service was attentive and friendly and we all loved our meals. We ended up trying a lot of different desserts; they had so many to choose from!

/user_details?userid=VPTIP7COdCLZdHSl66ZX3A,Luke C.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Fairly good food.  First time here last night with a party of 5. We were seated quickly.  The staff was friendly, but the service was a bit slow. For example, the bread on demand only came once despite multiple demands. I got the big bone marrow and a pork shoulder. Other members of our party got the mussels, meat plate, and lamb special. I was told usually an individual who goes to the restaurant would finish the 3 bone marrows and salad. This surprised me. Seriously. Look at the pictures I attached. It's significant amounts of fat.Nonetheless, I think one or two would have been perfect. Definitely worth getting if you can handle the large amounts of fat. Otherwise, the meat plate is great to share.  Other members of our party got it. The pâté was quite standout among the meat plate. The pork shoulder broke down well, and the potatoes were a great complement. I think the sauce was also quite good.  The lamb was a lot gamier than in the states, but if you like that it's definitely worth getting as well. Overall a fairly good experience."

I took my aunt and her husband that were visiting from Florida here because they wanted to try a good gastropub. This place came to mind. We shared the daily entrée which was a chicken liver pâté. It was quite good. Auntie got the mussels that came with fries which she enjoyed and her husband got the bangers and mash that was ok as well. I ordered the chicken breast on salad which turned out quite dry and not so crispy skin. Food wasn't bad. But wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. Then again, we enjoyed our evening there :)"

I went there on a Friday evening around 6, it had a good bit of people but it wasn't that noisy, I really liked the vintage decor they totally nailed it. I ordered their Beet Salad, with their Sazerac Cocktail and Chocolate Fondant. Very good point: The service was perfect and extremely quick, which is a plus plus for me. Not so good point: I have to admit that I didn't like the Beet Salad which was a bit tasteless :/ (side note: My friend also mentioned that her Pulled Pork Sandwich didn't really taste like pork). That time wasn't a total wow for me... well at least in the food department. However, I would still recommend Dominion Square Tavern for the overall experience and I will go back and try the rest of their menu."
/user_details?userid=eZQlG7uPiRp0jhBbd1XA_w,Julia T.,"Boisbriand, Canada",4 star rating,"Wednesday, 23rd August 2017Made my reservation online, quick and simple. The restaurant called me the morning of my reservation to confirm.We were a table of 6, we had one of the nicest table in the restaurant; corner couch, comfortable and away from the crowd. The lighting is very dark, some type like a lounge, small beautiful candles on your table, really gives a special touch, makes it so romantic. We started off with drinks, I took a Cosmopolitain, it was delicious and very strong, they did not miss out on the alcohol dosage. Afterwards, we decided to share the Homemade Charcuteries appetizers (the big one), everything on the plater was to die for. I was a little disappointed with the quantity of each portion of charcuteries, we ordered the bigger plat and yet it was not big enough. I would say it is a good quantity for a table of 3 or 4. As well, we got a little bit of bread. While we were eating our Charcuteries appetizer, we asked 4 times for some extra bread, because each time a new plate of bread would arrive, we would each have one piece. If you want bread and butter, you need to request it or else they will not bring some.Afterwards, we ordered some wine; Pinot Grigio 2015, Vino a Gogo, very good. As my main course, I order the Pan Seared Salmon with kedgeree and sauce vierge. It was so delicious, nothing was left on my plate. The salmon had a crispy-skin left on top, which I love, and it was accompanied by some sort of rice and sauce vierge, the flavour of it, was amazing. My friends ordered the Braised Beef Shoulder with mashed potatoes with cheddar, horseradish carrots. They didn't find the cooking to be as precise as they asked, however they said it was all delicious, especially the mashed potatoes with cheddar.On to dessert, I order the Nutmeg Doughnuts with sour cream, it was 4 donuts, 2 big ones and 2 like a timbit, all rolled in sugar. I was disappointed about the dessert, it wasn't as good as the rest, the donuts were dry, when you could see very well that they were freshly done, so that means that their dough was maybe old. I would not order those a second time.Overall, the place is beautiful, nice ambiance, the food was great and the service from Dylan, our waitress was excellent. I will be back for sure. Thank you for a nice evening."
/user_details?userid=Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,On a cold and rainy night in April my friend and I wandered in here to see if we could get a drink.  Luckily since it was just the 2 of us we got seats at the bar.  I'd definitely come back to this place for drinks (we didn't order any food but I did take a look at the dinner menu - for the options it seemed quite $$$$$). It has a very old school British pub/vintage feel to it.  I love that kind of ambiance.  The cocktail drinks were lovely - the gin selection is great.   If you are not sure about what kind of drink you want just ask the bartenders and they will recommend something based on what kind of flavour profiles you like.  The service was great and the atmosphere made me want to stay here and order another drink and relax but sadly we were on a bar crawl and had to hit up the next place.

There is great care put into the food and you can really taste the quality of the ingredients and preparation.  The prices are fair and as are the portion sizes.

The salmon was out of this world good , cooked and spiced to perfection and the rice and veggies were also tasty and well cooked. The Mussels with fries portion was quite large.  However, they did not sacrifice quality for quantity by any means here as the mussels were big /juicy and the broth they were served in was so delicious we all ordered more bread to be able to keep dipping !  I really liked this place and I would recommend it for a lunch , a dinner , a date , a dinner with a friend etc...

The banger sausages reminded me of a German sausage and the sauce was also very good.

You will be transformed back in time, it feels like an old barber shop or restaurant from the late 1800's - early 1900s. there is a true craft into each drink, especially if you sit at the bar---you can watch the bar tender make a drink with the long, but interesting process. its not just a simple vodka and cranberry drink, everyone comes with a different process and is in a cup or glass that fits in perfectly. For example, my mint julep came in a silver steel cup with a big ice snow ball on top, with a mint leave. the straw was dug into the ice, and below was my delicious mint julep. Drinks are stong, and get the job done.I was not a fan of the free bread they give you...but the deviled eggs are the best damn deviled eggs ive ever had. =)"

After a 10 hour travel day, I was really looking forward to an elevated bistro-style meal with a good wine or cocktail list. Dominion isn't fussy or pretentious, just delicious, well-executed favorites. I made a reservation on Open Table but they were just as happy to seat me at the bar as a single diner (I prefer the bar to a table when alone). The wait staff was friendly and attentive and indulged my attempts at small french phrases. The decor is upscale french bistro with tinted glass, low lighting, and homestyle tables. I ordered a red Bourgogne and started with the deviled egg. It was SPECTACULAR. I wiped the dish clean with my finger. Could be shared with one other person. For my main, I had the moules frites. HUGE portion, with a side of frites and aioli. Could easily be shared by two or split as an appetizer by 3 or 4. I went to their sister restaurant, Balsam Inn, for an after-dinner cocktail. Their menu looks equally delicious, though Italian in style. I highly recommend giving both restaurants​ a try."

He made me feel welcomed despite my bright red graphic T-shirt, blue jeans,  and worn out leather boots - not so classy. The food was great but what I really loved was the little wink at Balsam Inn, the neighboring bar, with their balsam fir ice cream and tangerine tartlet - I always enjoy food with a little story behind."

We stopped by for a few drinks after dinner, and fell in love with the place. If you like Rye, I highly recommend getting the Basil and Rye. It was my favorite, so much so that I've spent the past few months trying to recreate it. The Sazerac was pretty good as well, but I would steer clear of it if you're not a fan of absinthe. The drinks are reasonably priced, especially coming from NYC. The bartender was extremely nice, walking us through his favorites on the menu as well as some of his favorite places to visit in the city.  While I cannot speak for their food, I definitely plan on stopping by the next time I'm in Montreal."

They sit you down and you find yourself yelling at your wife and mother-in-law who are sitting right next to you just so they could hear you talk; you have to shine your iPhone flashlight on the menu just so you can read it because this place is dimmly lit, and every table is jam packed and it's only Wednesday!  This place is AWESOME!The ambiance is very lively!  The tavern is filled with beautiful people enjoying their food, their drinks and their company.  If you're bringing a date it's loud and dim inside, but that's a good thing because you need to get a lot closer to your date to talk to and see them.  If you're a couple of single guys there are tables of women having a night out.  If you're a couple of single women the waiters are very handsome (the wife believes that's probably why there were so many tables of women.) LolThe food is insanely good!  My wife and the mother-in-law describe the food as English Pub with French flair. They shared the Cornish hen and that bird was tender and the skin crispy.  It sat on a bed of roasted vegetables that sopped up all the drippings from the hen.  What really brought this entree over the top was that it was stuffed with goat cheese.  You take a bite of the savory tender chicken and roasted veggies and then have a little of the salty goat cheese . . . I mean it's ridiculously good, just ridiculous!  I had the Bangers and Mash and do you know what that waiter had the nerve to ask me?  He said the sausage is Apple Cider today is that okay?  Of course it's okay, bring those bangers on!  The sausage had a slight sweetness from the apple cider. The cheddar cheese mashed potatoes were creamy with a slight saltiness.  Can you imagine how that tasted?  Oh My!  There are no words to describe the Sticky Toffee.  The closest I can get to in a description is . . .  Just get it, Just get it, JUST GET IT!"

The bar itself is lovely - old wood counters and porcelain (looking) sinks filled with ice held chilling bottles of wine. A rolling library-style ladder rail ran the length of the bar, though perhaps more for looks than practicality - the space was a bit too tight to use the contraption for anything more than stocking the display shelves on wine and liquor above the antique(d) mirrors.The food was delicious - endive salad and mussels in ale with frites. A lovely selection of wines and a tempting list of cocktails, including gins with housemade tonic."

I came here and didn't know what to expect - but to summarize it with two words - truly tasteful! I came here with a friend for a snack prior to the movies, and we orders the muscles. It was boiled with white-white and smelled really good! The portion was sufficient for two people to share.The winner here is the home-made tonic and Hendrick's Gin for $10 which is a steal in my opinion! The home-made tonic smells very floral and pleasing to the nose. The blend between Hendrick's and the tonic they craft in house is truly amazing. I asked for some lemon on the side to add some lemon flavour to my drink because I like my Gin and Tonic a little sour. The decors as mentioned in the other reviews make the ambience of the restaurant tasteful and allow guests to truly have a good time! I went on the night of a hockey game and they even had a wooden score board up by the bar with the score of the game.

And the marrow is so fatty, it is like a punch in the stomach.  You better have lots of hot/sour/alcoholic stuff with it if you want to digest it.  I thought the portion could be smaller, but the bones could be from a better part of the cow which is not as fatty.Good experience, but could have been better.  They are trying a bit too hard, but some more attention to the food could go a long way."

We sat at the bar which was well staffed with numerous mixologists, I'll call them, since their concoctions were meticulously crafted.  My wife ordered a Pimm's cup which was pretty delicious and refreshing I have to say. I went with the ""Canadian"" old fashioned which was outstanding. I really just wanted to get a mold to make those huge ice balls for my own drink.  (Speaking of ice balls, it was -10 outside so I highly recommend this place as a place to dive in for a drink while you toast up.) We ordered the bone marrow which was very good. We were amazed at how generous the portion was. Three large bones FULL of marrow.  We're big fans of the bone marrow at Blue Ribbon in NY which comes with an oxtail marmalade. The marmalade helps cut the really fatty taste a bit which I think would've been nice here, considering how much actual marrow we got. Overall, great place for a drink and some french plates.  On the pricier end but the drinks are well made."

Don't get me wrong, high heals are not a must, you would be accepted with your jeans and teeshirt, but I would prefer to have a chic cocktail experience. So my review is entirely based on the quality of the drinks, I haven't had a chance to experiment seriously with their food yet. The mixes the bartenders prepare are delicious. They won't overdo on alcohol and it will take few drinks to get a buzz, which is good as few drinks are required. I'm a huge fan of the basil and rye cocktail, this drink wins the five stars for the tavern. As well as the impeccable service and the fact that everything is happening in the background of well selected sweet jazz or blues music. Must try place downtown Montreal!"

I've been sending friends who visit Montreal and want recommendations here, and I was excited to bring my boyfriend here tonight. The patio service on the evening of 5/29/16 wasn't very good. The food came fast enough, but the Jameson we ordered never came, the bread I asked to go along with my mussels never came, and I witnessed some intense dirty look side-eye from the bus boy when a neighboring table asked for olives with their round of drinks. Server asked if we wanted dessert. No, because we know it will never come, and your colleagues are making me uncomfortable. The server was hard to find when we wanted to ask for the check, then once we had it he kept disappearing before we could pay. It took longer to settle up then it took to eat. I know being a server is tough work, and I'm not sure what a day in their life at a busy downtown restaurant is like, but tonight's service was far from professional and unfortunately it left a sour note on the evening. Food was fine, but I won't be coming back, and I can't recommend the place to anyone anymore. I can't go back to a place with such disregard and contempt for its customers. Fix the service, or hire better actors."

At my last visit (just now, at writing), I ordered their pulled pork sandwich and fries. The pulled pork was an absolute disaster... the texture was mushy. Yuk!!!

After making a day-of reservation only hours earlier (and wildly easily, I might add!), ladyfriend and I arrived, were greated warmly, and showed to a cosy table by the wall.  We ordered cocktails that did NOT come out of a can NOR contained improper spelling in the name and, well, died a little bit.  The drinks were exceptional, an we definitely kept them coming throughout the evening.  The wine list was also quite good and fairly comprehensive.  We ordered fish croquette to start, with some glorious may on the side, mussles in a cider steam with bacon (!!!!) and the steak special, and a brownie and ice cream for dessert. The atmosphere and decor are amazing.  I may be biased, as I love pretty much anything art deco, but they'd done it well, a perfect balance of modern and classic, right down to the dressing of the bar and wait staff.  The Good - The food had some incredible highs (I'm sorry, did you miss that bacon with the mussels?!).  We left full and satiated but not stuffed.  - The vibe.  Amazing.  I would come to Mtl just to hang here. - The drinks.  Yummy as all get out. The Not-So-Good- There were highs to the food, but there were also some dishes that didn't quite hit the mark.  Those incredible mussels?  They didn't have anything even on the menu for me to sop up that broth.  So sad.  Also, and it pains me to say, I've had better brownies.  Richer, more moist.  I was a little underwhelmed.  - Though their house drinks were phenomenal, their ""off menu"" cocktails may be limited.  I asked for a Last Word, a rather classic and common one in my mind, but weren't able to fulfill all the ingredients.Overall, I give it a solid 4.5"

That being said I still think it has a fun unique feel and it's perfect for a small group (3-4) for dinner and drinks. The cocktails are fancy and fun - each has a proper glass, the amaretto sour had an inch of foam and was too sweet for my liking, but the server was so nice and offered to change it without hesitation.. I actually liked the taste of it so much (you could taste the fresh lime), that I just asked if he could water down the sweetness with some club soda, then it was perfect. The gin gimlet, on the other hand, recommended by a friend, was delicious and I highly recommend it! Sadly I made a terrible mistake of ordering the roast chicken on salad (I was really in the mood for poultry) but I should've split the Cornish hen with some instead, because it was juicy while the roast chicken was very dry and the salad felt like it was a simple Caesar - despite the menu claiming it to be a cheddar vinaigrette. The lemon cheesecake was nice and light, but not your dense New York style cheesecake (which is my preference), but it was tasty nonetheless."

Despite the tavern's emptiness, the hostess wanted to seat us at the bar (we refused) and when other patrons came in, they were also directed to the bar (including an old couple). I noticed that there WERE some reserved tables, but not all of them, so I don't know why everyone was asked to sit at the bar.  We were also told we had to be out of there by 7:30. Considering we arrived around 4:30pm, I think the hostess jumped the gun a little. I mean, why not just tell me to go elsewhere while you're at it? The wait staff wasn't exactly warm and welcoming so I can't say that I wanted to spend an extended amount of time there anyway. My friend and I were in our Lululemon gear because we'd walked up the mountain, so I'm not sure if this impacted the level of service that we got, but anyway. We weren't impressed, especially considering how much they charge for food and drinks. The decor is gorgeous - I loved it! It's very classy and reminds me of old-school British pubs, with bottles lining the wall, a wood bar/furniture etc. Visually, this place is very appealing. It's also quite quite large, and has a small terrace.  In terms of food, I wasn't impressed at all. I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese and it was very ordinary. The beets were good, but they were served with lettuce and ranch dressing, and the beets weren't even warm. The goat cheese also wasn't crumbled. Typically, if I see a beet salad on the menu, I'm expecting warm beets and crumbled goat cheese, with some kind of light dressing.  I was aware of the rand dressing scenario but I guess the salad wasn't what I expected. Overall, the salad was bland and overpriced at $15. I also ordered some fries that were served in a small bowl. The fries were crispy and good, but way overpriced at $6. I can get an entire basket of home fries at any other pub in town for about the same price or less. My friend also felt that her beer was overpriced. I had a Pimm's Cup, which was delicious but I can't really comment on the price ($11) because I've never ordered this anywhere else in Montreal.I would say it's definitely a great place for drinks, but save your cash and dine elsewhere."

When I told him I went there for dinner he said ""why would you go to that dump?"" Then one day we walked by and I brought him in. He changed his tune. ""Everything's different, but yet nothing is different"" Times have changed. I won't go into the details of everything I've eaten here. I've been a couple times and it's all good. Love the decor, the service, the drinks. It's just a tad expensive for what it is. So don't be surprised when you bill arrives. PS: The wines aren't affordable. The cheapest one is like 50$ and it's certainly not a good value for what it is. Go with the drinks instead."

I thought each dish was extremely tasty and pretty much as good as it gets. I don't see bone marrow being served too often in other restaurants in Montreal, so I love that I can get that here. If I go again (see below), I would pretty much order anything off the menu. All the options looked really interesting.The staff was courteous but I had to wait 1 hour for the beet salad and salmon. They warned me that the bone marrow would take approximately 20 minutes to prepare, but that ended up being out fairly quickly. After 40 minutes waiting for the beet salad and salmon, I checked in with the waiter who said it would be 5 more minutes, but in reality it was 20. I feel like they kinda forgot about us."

And yeah, I was at Joe Beef the other day. Their marrow app is great and all, but Dominion takes the cake.If you have a choice, come on a Sunday because their roast is divine. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with their Cornish hen for 2.Negative: They don't accept Amex. Get with the times!"

/user_details?userid=lPqIwC1QWXq7OY0sm-Vc9A,Shadoe H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Possibly my favorite spot in town for a drink. A amazing experience from start to finish: what's not to love about the retro turn of the 20th Brit-Canadian aesthetic? Come for the drinks: a full stock bar where each cocktail comes in the right glass and with the right ice. Pick from the diversified options on the menu but don't be shy to ask for something custom: the bar is fully stocked with a variety of options and the barkeeps knowledgable and skilled. The food is equally good (fries that will make you wish they had a poutine) but somewhat old fashioned in it's menu (which is the point). You won't go wrong with the mussels or the pulled pork sandwich, but if you're on the picky side I'd visit fist for drinks before committing to a meal there. Tavern isn't cheap, but is money well spent every time. Useful: Busy often. You'll seldom have trouble walking in to find a seat at the bar open for you and a guest, but if you'd like a table call in advance. You don't have to call weeks ahead or anything, but better safe than sorry."

/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Our lunch experience at Dominion Square Tavern, did not disappoint at all. However! Let me strongly advice you to make reservations prior to going. Trust me, you will thank me for that advice. I'll explain as to why. Upon our arrival at 11:45am EVERY single table was reserved, luckily only one for two people was available. Great! As we were approaching to our table, we noticed it was by the entrance doors. Had it been a warm, sunny day. I wouldn't have cared. Unfortunately that day was breezy and chilly. Therefore from time to time, we felt a cold breeze.  Nothing that was unbearable.The coldest part of our lunch was the hostess. Her attitude was unprofessional and unkind. I did not appreciate that at all. Not once did she smile or show any enthusiasm.  I politely asked her where could I hang my coat, since the chairs are not suitable to hang long coats. She simply pointed at the coat hanger. You ask, where is the issue? Well I'm quite petite and it's obvious that I could not reach to the coat hanger. Not once did she offer to hang it  for me or offer any assistance. I was quite bothered by that.  Luckily a very polite, and kind waiter saw the issue approached me and said.. ""I'm sorry about that, let me assist you"" That changed my entire way of seeing the restaurant.  I always love, and appreciate kindness and hard working people who truly care about their job. Now that we are seated in a small, yet comfortable table. A true gentleman of a waiter introduces himself and asks us if we would like anything to drink. We chose our drinks. Five minutes later, he returned to take the order of our meals. We ordered Moules et Frites, and Bangers & Mash(Housemade sausages with creamy buttery mashed potatoes) served along with vibrant green and fresh green peas.  We were told that this particular dish takes 15 minutes to prepare. I appreciate the head up! When glancing at the menu, I noticed they had Hof Kelsten bread(I STRONGLY recommended!)  To those that are hardcore foodies and familiar with Hof Kelsten. You'll understand what I mean. Right? The bread is an extra charge. Relax!  It's worth every penny! We were given generous slices of ultra fresh with an excellent moist level and fantastic crust white bread, encrusted with anise seeds. Alongside of a generous pad of salted butter. Perfect touch!  I couldn't stop eating it. Ok.. Now fast forward to exactly fifteen minutes, both of our meals were served extremely hot and oh so beautifully presented. From the lovely dishware that added the perfect antique look to the entire ambiance, to the outstanding presentation of the food. I felt a bit bad ruining such beautiful dish. Meh! Who I'm I kidding. I was famished therefore I began to eat it with no guilt. Oh wait! I first had to snap a photo of course. Luckily the lighting of the sun and the restaurant lights was perfect for food photography.Once you both begin eating and there is an absolutely silence, eyes are closing, slow bites of food are being enjoyed. You know the dishes are prepared to perfection! Indeed they were. The moules were not at all tough or rubbery, they were soft, silky and perfectly cooked in a sauce that had bits of beacon and shallots.   Served with their housemade fries which were cooked to a crisp perfection and tender inside. Again, just perfect!!As for the bangers, and mash which was my dish. To be honest, I'm still craving it! The dish has two generous size sausages, with a great texture and not at all salty or a paste like filling as some low quality sausages elsewhere tend to be. They had a lovely hint of anise seed, which is a licorice like flavour. Settle, but lovely. Served on a generous portion of buttery, creamy, silky mashed potatoes. Drizzled with a lovely onion based sauce. Oh my! Comforting galore and just so so good!Now that we finished our meals with a smile from ear to ear. Our bellies were screaming due to how full we felt. Regardless, we had to go for dessert. Why? Well let me share a little tease. They have freshly made to order nutmeg & cinnamon sugar donuts. Or sticky toffee pudding. Oh my.. so many childhood memories and once again pure comfort. What to choose?  We couldn't resist and chose to order the donuts. Five minutes later, they've arrived. Oh so darn cute and golden. It's basically two small donuts with each having a small donut hole in the middle. Served with a small dish on the side of fresh sour cream. Strange combo, no? Rest assure the combination was lovely. The sour cream had the lovely sour touch to cut down a bit of the sweetness from the donuts. To end my endless review let me make note of one very important factor about the restaurant which is what impressed me the most. What was it? Our waiter, named Julien. No.. This has nothing to do with his looks. I'm mentioning this because this is none other than all due to his fantastic and very professional work he did serving us.  He spoke clear, he was kind, and a true gentleman. Ask for him!"

Probably not the best ""romantic"" place for dinner.I usually get beer or wine with dinner, but this time I tried one of their cocktails, a Sazerac. Bourbon and Absinthe with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Really good.The Scotch Egg is excellent. The white is always cooked just right, with a nice runny yolk. The sausage coating has just the right crispness. Add some of the cream sauce to each bite and you have a great appy.I've always gotten the braised beef as my entree. It comes on a mound of mashed potatoes, and just falls apart. The sauce is rich and beefy.I think overall, it's just a bit over priced, but you'll leave happy."

They are on the pricier side, but the bartenders churn out quality concoctions. One tip: it's not that crowded on the weekends at night! It's right bang in the middle of the business district and seems to quiet down as the night carries on. Have never eaten here so unfortunately cannot speak to the food.

The salad had iceberg lettuce, celery and was slathered in dressing then they tossed an extraordinary amount of croutons in and topped with beets, blobs of goat cheese and half a hard boiled egg.  Not exactly what I was expecting for a beet salad but not bad.  Overall the food was fine.  Not great, just fine, and a bit overpriced for what you get.  We would rate this a little higher then three stars because the space and service were really great but the food was just average."

Last Friday my sister, mother and I were looking for a place to have dinner, which was proving to be difficult since Prince was playing at the Bell center and every restaurant was filled to capacity. Most places looked at us like we were crazy and said they had no room. The hostess at the Dominion Square Tavern told us the same thing but the manager stopped us before we hit the door and said he thought he might have a spot for us, 5 minutes later we were sitting at a table sipping cocktails. The place was packed and our waitress was running left and right trying to get people out in time for the show, when she came by to take our drink order she asked us if we were going to the show, to which we said no, she then asked us if we were in a hurry, which we weren't that seem to take a little pressure off her, giving us some of the best service I've had in a long time. We were looked after by our waitress but also by another waiter who had noticed our section was very busy, so he jumped in to help without any prompting. What made our experience so nice was the fact that everyone at the Tavern was there to make sure we had a great evening which we did.The decor is very nice, as soon as you walk in the door you feel like you're in an old french tavern. The lighting is (in my mind) just right not to bright but not so dark that you can't see the person sitting across from you. They play an interesting mix of music which I found to be great, they got the volume just right, I could hear my sister and mother without having to strain my hearing. everything seem to be just so, right down to the bar tender with a mustache and the slicked hair.And now the food, we started with cocktail the Tavern has a nice selection of cocktail like the Gin Julep, Tom Collins and the royal Gin fizz, all of them taste great and contain a generous serving of alcohol. We then had our main course I had the fish and chips, it was very good there are better places but this was good. The fish was light and flaky it didn't taste heavy and greasy like fried fish sometimes can, the fries were also good but like I said this isn't their specialty. Everything we ordered was well prepared from high quality ingredients and served with a nice presentation.The Dominion Square Tavern offers a great all around experience but their customer service from the time you walk in to the time you pay your bill is incredible, this is why I would recommend it to any one who asked me, try it you'll like it. Just remember to make a reservation."

Something out of the 1920s, totally loved the decor and the waiters/waitress'/bartenders outfits.I had a few stout beers that were delicious! I started with the white fish croquettes, which were pretty good. I ordered the Beef Sirloin as my main, it had a wine and melted butter sauce and came with mashed potatoes with cheddar as a side. It was very well cooked and tasted amazing! The meat had a very nice crispy sear and soft, creamy inner. I would definitely have this meal again. We ended up getting the absinthe before leaving. This was a very cool experience. They serve it in a classy glass, a knife with holes in it on top which has two sugar cubes that  rest upon it. Some contraption sits on top of the glass holding ice cubes. You have a small pitcher of water which you pour over the ice which then drips down over the sugar melting it into the drink. I filled it about half way before drinking it. Fantastic experience! Would go back for sure!"

The space had a great tavernish atmosphere and we were seated right away even though we had expected to have to wait.We had the fish cake, the scotch egg, and the mussels. The fish cakes (kind of like crab cakes but with fish) had strong smoke notes and was a bit salty. The scotch egg was done really well, crispy on the outside with a delicious meat layer and an oozing egg in the center. The mussels were well portioned for two people to share and were tasty. Didn't find a single closed shell in the bunch.Overall, I think the food was executed well and the service was friendly and prompt. For the price though, I was expecting to be wowed a bit more."

We both had the steak, a cocktail and dessert, all of it excellent. We were seated at the bar in front of what must be the most amazing copper cappucino machine I've ever seen in my life and looks like it just plucked out out of some Art Deco film like Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"".While prices are a little on the high side, this is still a great place to come for eats either after a movie or before a game. Really love the old school Anglo-Canadian decor and touches like the wooden coat-of-arm shields representing each province and territory and the wooden molding.Come here for a drink, you'll like it."

Definitely only takes 1-2 of these bad boys before my troubles start to fade away....Old review:The servers are indifferent and unhelpful. The food is fine... But expensive. This restaurant is definitely lacking that special something that takes a restaurant from ""just OK"" to ""WOW."" However, my biggest gripe is with the cocktails. I will pay $11-15 for a drink that packs some punch (i.e.: contains ALCOHOL). However, that much for a drink that is so weak you finish it in 2.5 seconds is laughable. So, I started ordering doubles, which brought my total for 2 regular drinks and 2 doubles (total: 4 drinks, 2 of which actually tasted like they had any gin in them whatsoever) to $70, not including tax and tip.

It's a sort of restaurant. But with a bar. But fancy. There's also a sign at the front that says you have to wait to be seated. So I waited. I wanted to sit at a table, but apparently you can only sit at a table if you're eating. So I had to sit at the bar and felt self-conscious the whole time that people could see my buttcrack...And that's the trouble with this whole thing, really. Because this is the kind of place where I go and I think that the problem, really, is me. Because as I sat there with Joanne, getting progressively drunker on blah-ish expensive drinks, eating so-so fries, developing that sinking imposter-syndrome feeling, the place kept filling up with people for whom this was all Just Fine - a good time on the town: sitting there without really experiencing any sort of discomfort at the faux-nostalgia of the whole thing, feeling ok with listening to hours upon hours of contrived acoustic string-band music."

Handsome bartender was attentive throughout even though I didn't order any alcohol, merely their home-made seltzer.

Yeah, it burns, but yeah, it's great. Had the mussels, which were tastier than hell, and there were plenty of them. Price was good on the food, a little high on the drinks.

It's basically a soft boiled egg wrapped in smoked beef(?) and deep fried, so this sucker is the size of a tennis ball, so it's a great appetizer to split.Then we had the mussels and frites --- Two yummy beers (Belgian Style, proper) and made ourselves get the sticky toffee pudding after watching someone next to us nom pretty hard on one. All very good, we were completely sated and happy. The wait staff was really attentive and oddly --- the bathrooms were awesome and clean. Weird thing to notice but, ever since this health inspector told me "" I always look at the bathrooms in an establishment first, and 98% of the time it tells me everything I need to know about how clean the kitchen is too""  I always gotta check 'em out."

Having a little more information about the different beers would be useful.I had the Sunday Roast special, which was OK but the cut of meat was quite fatty and the yorkshire pudding was uninspiring. The corn chowder that came as an option on the meal was really good, and the staff was nice."

I would definitely suggest making a reservation as all the reserved tables started filling in shortly after I was seated. The drink menu looked pretty extensive; I got the Canadian Tom Collins and was really happy with it. Not quite sure what the Canadian part was.. Perhaps some maple syrup? I had the mussels for an entree -- the chunks(!) of bacon complemented the mussels really well. The portion was rather large as well.The wait staff was very helpful too.

I was lucky to come across Taverne Square Dominion. Their food is really good. I ordered their corn fritters as an appetizer and OH MY GOD! They were amazing. They come with their homemade ""catsup"". My boyfriend and I were practically fighting over them. For dessert, I HIGHLY recommend the sticky toffee pudding; it is heaven in your mouth. The service is excellent. I ordered the bacon and cider mussels and someone came by to change my plate where I put my shells. It was a little on the pricey side but well worth it. The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful, really a true delight. I would recommend this place for a date or even to grab some good gastropub cuisine."
/user_details?userid=OJDOFhFlUdYLsKLeXL2ulg,Chanel R.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"I simply love this place. It's honestly as good as it gets in terms of old world charm in Montreal. I'm sure there are similar places like Tavern Sq., but in planning for my trip to Montreal for a long weekend, this place showed up in numerous searches. I'm so glad it did. A friend and I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too packed. Lots of groups and a great mix of 20, 30, 40, 50+ somethings. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile and seated. Over the course of the night (2.5 hours), the staff were attentive, kept and eye on our table to refill wine and water when needed, and the vibe was just relaxed and laid back. If you're used to places that clearly have a ""get-cha in, get-cha out"" feel...you can definitely appreciate Tavern for more than just the food.Now the food....amazing. period. It's pricey for a reason and an entree will probably run you anywhere from $20 - 50 (CDN) but I couldn't ask for anything more than I received when my plate showed up. I ordered the braised beef, which comes with mashed potatoes, and it was perfection. We also had the nutmeg doughnuts that were like pillows. I wasn't sure how a sugared, fried cake doughnut would taste with sour cream, but now I crave it. It was that good. Get rid of any idea you have about a 'donut' and visit with a open mind and hungry stomach because you'll want more. At the end of the night, our bill was about $120 for two plates, dessert and a bottle of rose, but it was well worth it. Go in knowing you're getting a proper culinary treat. I would go back in a heartbeat."

He offered a free round of drinks (I'm 9 months pregnant) on our next round. My husband had already had 3 glasses of wine at this point and we assumed he would comp us one glass of wine and my $4 limeade. We didn't get dinner for another 25 minutes and when the bill came (also late) he didn't comp a glass of wine or my limeade. We loved the ambiance and the menu. When he told us there was a discrepancy we were still sure we'd be back but after offering a round of drinks (kind of a crappy offer for a pregnant girl) and didn't come through?

The staff leave much to be desired and pull off the attitude that gives the delightful French a bad rep which is too bad. This reason is reflected in the rating and really took away from our experience. Onto more important matters... Cocktails are more old school in their execution and stiff.

/user_details?userid=zzgb9L3NBT9V8BGw_DcVYw,Belle D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ever read some F. Scott Fitzgerald and wished you could experience the Roaring Twenties like Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan? Dominion Square Tavern welcomes you to the last years of La Belle Époque, where drinks are made with homemade tonic, coffee comes out of an enormous brass machine, and out-of-reach wine bottles are taken down with the help of an old, wooden, library-styled ladder.I went for a drink with a friend. Here, cocktails are delicious and crafted with care - none of that sloppy pre-counted watered down stuff. The atmosphere is beyond pleasant, and the clientele mainly consists of young professionals with a dapper edge dispersed by a few supercute older couples enjoying their meals. An awesome scene that suits the venue.What's more, the food is delicious. It's not that I didn't expect it to be tasty, but considering its downtown location... Well, you know. Downtown Montreal desperately needs to be rescued from its overgrowth of cheap-o diners (Dunn's, McDonald's) and it's wtf-are-you-thinking-in-terms-of-price/quality-rapport restaurants (Newtown, Bice).So, as soon as we were handed the menus, we caved. One chicken salad ($18), please. Let me be clear - this is no Boccacino's chicken salad (which even 10 years later still haunts me). This chicken salad has crispy lettuce, fresh dill, crunchy radishes, just the right amount of incredibly light cheddar cheese dressing (best oxymoron I've ever tasted), and the juiciest (on the inside) and crispiest (on the outside) chicken breast. Hands down the best chicken salad I've ever had.Being one of the best affordable places downtown, Dominion Square Tavern fills up fast, so be sure to make an RSVP. Or sit at the bar - it's a great scene. The service is incredibly friendly and attentive. The music is just loud enough for you to hear your favorite tunes without having to sacrifice comfortable conversation, and includes classics like The Rolling Stones' Under My Thumb and some alternative Amy Winehouse. This place is bustling, it's fun and it's elegant. And it's downtown. Welcome to the roaring twenties, hope you enjoy your stay.Food (onlyhad1thingbutstill) 9/10, Atmosphere 9/10, Pretty people (younggentlemenatthebar 9.5/10) (everyone else 8/10), Music 8.5/10, Service 9.5/10.Pictures: belledenuitmontreal.com/…"

I made reservations at Dominion for a party of 8 to celebrate my cousin's birthday. When we arrived everything was smooth. We had our table we were given menus, our server was informative about drinks and what they could and could not make. She even gave us a little tutorial on how to drink Absinthe for the person who ordered it. Now here are the deductions:SERVICE/FOOD: At arrival there were 4-6 parties seated, us being the largest group. By the time our food order was taken, the wait between the order placement and actually getting our food was RIDICULOUS!! Parties that arrived AFTER us got their food before we did! We nearly waited 45 minutes appetizers and our main courses. And to get our bill after we were all done? FORGET IT. We had asked one server for our check and he completely forgot to tell our main server that we needed the damn check. It took 15mins for her to get to us after we told the first server. And since it was my cousin's birthday that night, I had ordered her a dessert since didn't bother to order herself, but I really wanted to her to get a candle and everyone sing to her. I told the server to put her dessert on my tab. What did she do? SHE PUT HER WHOLE ENTIRE ORDER ON MY TAB. I clearly said just her dessert. Don't get me wrong, all the food here was great, but even Michelin star places pump out faster plates than this joint.Call me an inpatient American, go ahead, but a party for 8 people that was sat down at promptly 6:30 did not that that joint until 9:15!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!?!? I was a server once too and I know that you tend not to be so on top of bigger groups especially if they're celebrating and drinking, but seriously. Everything was such a drag in this place! Maybe I would come again just for drinks and to sit at the bar. Their Gin & Tonic was delicious.

The decor is suitable to a tavern, though more upscale and with great attention to detail - I love the old antique phone, the fonts used, and the wall art. I can see the touch of the people behind Baldwin Barmacie, another bar with great decor details.They have an ok wine list, but I prefer their cocktails, especially their gin & tonic with homemade tonic water. The Royal Gin Fizz is also a good choice. Food wise, I really enjoyed the roasted cod with kale and carrot purée: very flavorful and satisfying.

/user_details?userid=-BW3vpjG_RDxdlFs7xneOg,Diana Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"friday night, 9pm, without a reservation and we were seated within 5 minutes! imagine our luck! post-plane ride, i was hungry and my eyes were indeed larger than my stomach. the server was helpful in steering my friend and i clear of ordering too much. he gently let us know that we should see how we felt after the first 3 dishes. the bone marrow. oh the marrow! with some toast, marrow, and a little salt, i was in an extremely happy place. it comes with a brussel slaw of sorts and is delicious. no regrets on this dish. the meat. with rabbit, pork, & cured duck slices, radishes, tomatoes, carrots, celery, jam, whole seeded mustard, cheese, deviled egg, and some bread.. this was good but not great; it was heavy. however, i will note that it was a simple spread that seems to fit in with the canadian way. simple, no need to dress the ingredients. each component climbed its way onto the board as it each had a purpose (to be consumed together).witloof and blue cheese salad with maple pecan vinaigrette. delicious. it was light and fit with our rather heavy options of bone marrow and meat.didn't expect too much but the food is simple and on second visit i would probably skip the meat platter and do something heavier (ha!). definitely pick items that you cannot get too easily where you are from (if ur from out of town). it was enjoyable and the ambiance/lighting is great!"

Highly recommend the Canadian old fashioned."

The ambiance is worth a trip alone - definitely feel transported to a hipl, 20's time. Ordered the mussels - great! portions were more than hearty - great staff, service, skipped out on dessert as we were full. Place is busy, but not overly loud you can't hear your dinner companions talk - which is a rare balance in busy resto's!Definitely would recommend to friends coming to the city ! and will visit again ourselves."

It was on the way back to the hotel (Marriott) and it looked like a fun place for dinner.  The food was so good - ""English"" comfort food and it hit the spot! :)  The decor is definitely old school but cool and they have a small outdoor seating area.  The waitstaff was appropriately attentive and helpful.  I would definitely recommend and will come back the next time I am in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An episode of The Simpsons once accused the British of being food-boilers which may have been accurate at some period in time. I even have childhood memories of complaints about British fare being crud and tasteless. But beware there's been some changes going on in the past decade or so.You'll find proof of this at British spots like The Burgundy Lion and my new discovery, The Dominion Square Tavern which opened in the 1920s. It was once part of an adjacent hotel which was burned down, then became one of the first gay bars, with ehhh hmmm a back door (You can still see the sign in the alley) for discrete access. Eventually it dwindled down to a run of the mill pub, which as a passer avoided because it looked like a dump.In 2009 it came back to life and I have been going there since. The menu is brilliant and enticing with so many delicious options, one has trouble deciding on where to begin. As an Entrée, the Deviled Eggs, a throwback itself to the 70s dining experience, are simply rich and delicious. The Scoth Egg, I've had better but not to be overlooked. The winner for me is the Corn Fritters with homemade catsup. Deep fried corn. Sweet and succulent. As mains I've enjoyed a delicious Skirt Steak with sides. It's wasn't mindblowing but it was admirable and perfectly cooked. Also I've tried the Bison Short Rib. Awesome! Its short-rib and its bison; perfectly braised and oozing with flavour. The only thing that's amiss with the entire experience is the minimal amount of seasoning. Salt, butter and other such flavour enhancers are not to be dismissed. Without salt and butter, mashed potatoes are just boring. Same thing with meat. Salt & Fat should not be feared.The deserts are sweet and a propos, but nothing to make my eyes roll in the back of my head; but then I'm not a great amateur of deserts so take this comment with a grain of salt.What one shouldn't miss here is the bar, the mixed drinks. They make their own simple syrup and use freshly squeezed citrus. All this attention to details makes, my personal favourite and old school drink, the Tom Collins, the absolute best Tom Collins I've ever had. That bar is not to be dismissed by any mixed-drink geek. The service is a bit dry but not unfriendly and always courteous and professional and the restored turn of the 20th century décor will keep your eyes busy for a while. So apart from some seasoning issues I don't see a reason not to love this restaurant and I know I'll keep heading back again and again."

But, our experience with dining here was less than stellar. Yes, this is an impressive old building. Smacked with history and old world vibe. As much as the male servers were great at tending to our tablewares and water, our female main server, was slow, dismissive and unattentive to the point of being downright rude. Was it because we were two men, or that we were not French, or was she just a bi*ch that night. I don't really care. Our food was not all that impressive in comparison to the high price of everything. Just for notation, their Sunday roast special is actually a prime rib. The description is a bit misleading, at least to me it was. And, at $35 I can get prime rib elsewhere for less. I'm just saying. . . Not impressed, and not coming back. . . Ok, well maybe to sit at the bar and ogle the men working there. . ."

The first night for dinner and the second for dessert and coffee. Service was great. Employees friendly. My wife and I split the braised beef and loved it. Had a couple signature cocktails that were delish. My wife really liked the Cosmo as it had a little ginger in it along with bitters. Well made. I had a basil and rye concoction that was really good. The second night for dessert had the sticky toffee. As others said its great. Great atmosphere.

Old style classics food wise, they could jazz up the menu and bring in newer plates since its place that could become well known with locals, but it's the only real restaurant close to St-Catherine's st.  The rest are tourist traps or fast food. They do some great classics that are hard to find. Drinks are creative and amazing and barmen are very professional. Nice place to stop for a drink. Try the food too it's still done well.

/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had no idea this little gem existed until I was dragged there after Christmas shopping with a few friends. The decor is really original (for Montreal). If you've been to Paris, it's a dead-ringer for one of those bistros in the Marais or Monmartre. It's designed like a shotgun (long rectangle) and has a baroque edge to it. The lighting is low, and mainly from iron candelabras on the walls and ceilings. Details on the walls are everywhere, lending a sort-of medieval vibe to it as well. The waitstaff is very friendly and pleasant, and the drinks/food were perfectly fine. It's clearly not gunning for culinary stardom, but it's definitely a cut above regular pub-fare. I think this place is amazing, and totally out of place with the routine, tourist-trap schlock that's currently littering downtown. A must-see!"

Fork tender beef and moist chicken with crispy skin.  Service was just right.  In fact I dropped my knife and a server walking by never broke stride ans he scooped it up and returned seconds later with a replacement.  And I know it doesn't affect service, but all the staff were beautiful!"

Good portion size, and hit the spot after a long day of travel.  You must try a gin-based drink here - they are truly and justifiably proud of their very old school cocktail offerings.Friendly staff and good prices."

In addition, our flight was late and we were definitely going to be late. I had my hotel call the Dominion Square for us, and when we arrived (:20 late), our table was waiting for us and the host welcomed us with open arms. Asked us if we had a good trip and told us to sit and get comfortable for our meal. The cocktails were great (A++ Old Fashioned) and the Bangers and Mash had incredible complexity and major flavor.

Good points:  The entire wait staff is painfully attractive.  The bartender waiting on us looked like Don Draper.  No joke.  They all speak English and are very nice.  My sister loved her gin and tonic, apparently the tonic is made in-house.  She thought it was fabulous.  But none of this made up for the underwhelming food.  It was a little expensive for what I got.  If you are looking for an ok, slightly expensive for what you are getting meal where you can oggle waiters this is the place for you.  But in Montreal there are far better options."

The restaurant is very large and good for groups or last minute dinner plans. It had an old timey English, cozy, vintage feel to it which we appreciated on a cold rainy night. The service was fine. The drink menu is what sold us on the place. I'm really not a huge lover of cocktails but they had some really interesting ones on the menu. I ordered a Pimms Cup which is a traditional English drink and I absolutely loved it. In fact, it was probably the best cocktail I have ever had. To start we ordered the bone marrow appetizer. It was gigantic and could have easily fed 4 people (they served 3 huge bones). It was tasty at first but is very rich and kind of got icky after eating so much. I got the mussels in a bacon/cider sauce with fries for dinner and it was great. Mussels were delicious in that sauce and they didn't skimp on the portion at all. My boyfriend got a fish dish which he also enjoyed. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the  nutmeg donuts in sour cream. They were so doughy and yummy and warm. We returned the next evening for drinks and sat at the bar. We snacked on their chocolate brownie which was good and sampled a few more cocktails. Chatting with the bar tender was the highlight of our night. He was funny, interesting, knowledgeable and made great drinks. I would highly recommend this restaurant for its unique atmosphere, comforting food and creative drinks."
