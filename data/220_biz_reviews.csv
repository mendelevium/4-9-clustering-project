Went here after reading all the great yelp reviews and I cannot highlight enough how amazing this restaurant is!From the warm and welcoming chic decor, to the lovely staff and the outstanding menu!We started off with a glass of prosecco and aperol spritz. Share the focaccia, the burrata, the gnocchi and the vegetables of the moment which were delicious Quebec beans with almonds, butter, garlic and truffle oil! So yum!We were especially happy that they could easily make many dishes vegetarian, including the gnocchi.We topped everything off with a piece of the olive oil cake that was served with mascarpone cream and a peach coulis... I will be counting down the days until we can go back! Highly recommend!"

Service was excellent, we were served by different waiters and each of them were very attentive. We ordered the foccacia with side of olive oil and the buratta with roasted vegetables to start. Both were excellent, however, the buratta at Nora Gray and Pied de cochon is better. As mains we ordered the gnocchi and the tuna salad. The gnocchi were excellent and I really loved the velvetty parmesan sauce. The tuna salad was generous and UPDP prepared the tuna beautifully. For dessert we went for the olive oil cake and hazelnut caprese tort. The olive oil cake was really the highlight for us! It was absolutely delicious and I loved the caramel whipped cream that was dolloped on top. I certainly want to try and re create this dish at home! The hazelnut tort was also delicious and had an excellent hazelnut gelato on top. We decided to order coffees since we expected that UPDP would probably have a nice quality coffee. I'm glad we did, coffee was very good! I'm glad we finally stopped by UPDP, it's a great addition to the old port !"

There was more beans than pasta but the pork was quite soft.    The gnocchi was very good but if you dont like the bitterness of the rappini you may not like it as it was quite bitter.   I think the waiter said that they changed their recipe from last year.I had the spritz cocktail with blood orange and it was very good! Not sweet at all.And they didn't go easy on the alcohol! It was very strong!!Note that it's not a cheap meal. 3 small plates and 2 drinks was about 100$."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to this restaurant multiple times and it never fails to impress! The food, the wine, the service, the ambiance, is always on point. During this last visit, we were seated on the terrasse, which is a great spot to people watch and enjoy the view of the Old Port. We started off with the summer vegetable tartine and some olives to accompany our fizzy citrus cocktail, the tartine was flavourful and light, perfect for a hot evening and if you're looking for a light small plate. We also had the Caesar salad and the polpettes which are a constant on the menu. Those meatballs are heavenly! Thankfully, they are served with warm bread so you can soak up the tangy tomato sauce. They also have a great  selection of wines, all Italian, and our waitress was great at recommending a perfect pairing for the evening; an affordable light orange wine which went down like water . Don't miss this cafe next time you're visiting Old Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice little Italian place in old Montreal.  Warm rich inviting decor and friendly service. We were here on date night and it would have been a lovely romantic spot except we were seated between 2 large loud groups and had to shout at each other to be heard.  Not the resto's fault, but it is a small space and you will be very cozy with your neighbouring diners.  The menu is mostly small and medium plates meant to share.  We ended up each getting our own thing as different items on the menu appealed to each of us.  I had the soup of the day, a delicious cream of mushroom, followed by the gnocchi which were wonderful and light and came with bits of tender chicken and a rich cream sauce.  Both dishes were very good, my only complaint was that I found both of them to be a little too heavy on the salt for my taste.  Both dishes were very rich and sadly although the dessert menu looked tempting there was absolutely no room to try one... hopefully next time!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Dinner here consisted of well prepared food and a warm atmosphere. In their quest for authenticity, they only serve Italian wine and spirits. You cannot order a vodka soda or a bourbon on the rocks. If you are not a fan of negronis or a bitter citrus version thereof, you risk dissapointment in the cocktail department here. I had the UPDP Negroni as recommended by Leslie Chesterman. It was bitter and very sweet, like most of the others I've had before. I'm sure they mixed it perfectly, it's just that this cocktail in general tastes like diabetes in a glass. On to the food, we ordered a bunch of the small plates to share as well as the oysters. The oysters were a little on the small side, but tasted fresh and were served with two mignonettes (regular and spicy). The burrata appetizer was also very nice. Served with a walnut pesto and some vegetables, it went really well with an order of their focaccia bread (for an extra charge). I was expecting a salty burst of basil, parmesan, and olive oil. Their take on pesto was a little muted. It's still a delicious dish. It's hard to be disappointed with fresh burrata cheese. Served as an appetizer, the dish is essentially a home run which is why nearly every Italian restaurant offers it. To this day however, I have never had a burrata or mozzarella appetizer as good as the one served at Da Emma (hockey puck sized lobes of salty and creamy cheese, gargantuan fresh beefsteak tomatoes, basil, oil) The ingredients are simple, but execution and quality go a long way. Their Prosciutto di parma aged 18 months was very plain tasting. Served with some apple slices, I usually like a cured meat with a little more texture and concentrated flavour. The whole dish was very subtle. Nothing wrong with that if that's what people enjoy. No one went hungry, but my itch was not scratched here.The winner of the night for me was the porchetta which was served with fresh mustard seeds and potatoes. It was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and extremely moist. Just a comforting and wonderful dish.  I had a taste of my wife's gnocchi with crispy chicken skin and agreed with her that it was excellent albeit a tad bizarre as a concept. I also tasted our friend's veal carpaccio salad which again tasted very subtle and nice. Nothing revolutionary going on here. Desserts were tasty. We shared the chocolate cake and the olive oil cake. There is not much to say here; They are both simple and enjoyable slices of cake.The waitress was exceptionally friendly and offered to open the window for us. For some reason, the ventilation was not working last week and the restaurant felt like it was about 25 or 26 degrees celsius. It's clear that a lot of money has been invested into this operation and that they want to swim amongst the big fish of the Montreal restaurant scene. I think that they can get there, but some tweaks are necessary to turn this establishment into a destination where people who just have to get their fix are clamouring for a table."
/user_details?userid=0dAclgpNIO90XCNwplkhmw,Sj C.,"Reno, NV",5 star rating,"Possibly the best gnocchi I've ever eaten in my entire life!  It was described as a spinach ricotta gnocchi in a cream sauce with herbs (I think dill was mentioned? I will have to contact the restaurant to find out the exact ingredients as it was one of those ""sum is greater than it's parts"" concoctions).  The sauce had depth and layers of flavors that really paired well with the perfect pillows of melt in your mouth gnocchi.  The hostess who sat us was very patient in explaining the menu and the concept of the shared plates, she recommended 1 dish per person in the party for tasting with cocktails or 2 each for dinner service.  She suggested we could start with 1 and add on if we like, however, our waiters seemed a little put out when we wanted to add to our order after the initial dishes came out. (we ordered 5 to start as suggested, but then added on another 3)We tried the daily gnocchi (out of this world), Insalata Verde (okay, greens simply dressed with olive oil, a little lemon, and some grated cheese), meatballs (good, sauce was fresh and bright), burrata (creamy and fresh with cubed tomatoes) and a roasted mushroom bruschetta (very creamy mild cheese topped with mixed roasted mushrooms).  The table favorites were the mushroom bruschetta, gnocchi, and meatballs.  We ordered 2 more plates of the bruschetta as it was just a small tasting to share for 5 people (depending on where on the loaf of bread your toast comes from you will get 2 or 3 small slices, roughly the total size of a tea saucer, pricey for $17) we also ordered the Ceasar salad as I did not find the Insalata Verde to be that satisfying. The Ceasar is very very anchovy forward and the croutons were really hard, but the crisp shards of pancetta were a nice addition.  Overall very delicious but high price point."
/user_details?userid=lyxvWcFLoho5AB_GzZmdhw,Emily D.,"Norwalk, CT",4 star rating,"Came here after a mid-morning cruise in the harbor. At first, the open bar seats looked like a good option, but then decided it was too nice to be inside and the host happily cleared a table outside that was looking out to the harbor/waterfront. The outdoor server was so sweet and constantly came around checking on all tables and making sure everyone was set. The patio maybe has 10 tables and possibly half were sat at the time (1:30 pm on a picture perfect and sunny 75-degree Saturday afternoon). I couldn't believe that every seat wasn't taken, I truly enjoyed my time here that much. I was deciding between the gnocchi and the burrata, and ultimately went with the latter minus the nuts due to an allergy, based off of the servers recommendation. This dish came out almost immediately and the presentation was perfection. The flavors were good, but I wasn't a big fan of the dill mixed in. It's a personal preference, not their fault. I ate almost everything on the plate and devoured the delicious focaccia bread. You have to order this if you are here, it's delicious and you'll just keep eating more and more. The prices are a bit high, but it's a touristy area and the food quality is top-notch. Based off of the service, location and quality, I recommend you stop by. Ratings for a visit on 7/13/19 are as follows:- Food: 4 stars, 5 for the focaccia- Drinks: 4 stars, all I asked for was something with bubbles and they delivered- Location: 4 stars, right across from the cruise port and the outdoor seats are the best-Atmosphere: 5 stars, for the relaxed vibe and lovely decor (minus the awkward first date poorly playing out in front of me)"

They serve delicious Italian food which I went in to get dessert and the waiter recommended me the olive cake - it tasted divine. As drink, I got myself a camomille tea. Oh...I got the chance to touch a tulipe on the table - They are real! Overall, I think I can spend the whole evening in this beautiful place with no worry of the world outside. The decoration, the vibe and the music are made to feel like we are hanging out in an Italian cafe. Maybe I am in Italy... the food name are Italians!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Great spot in the heart of old port Montreal. Beautiful restaurant, great vibes with loud chatter in the restaurant. The staff have an air of importance as they welcome you and seat you.We were a group of 3 seated at the bar as none of their tables were available even though it was requested.The stools are comfortable for maybe 30 mins so sitting here for 2 hours was not fun. Eventually we asked to move to a table when the restaurant emptied out a bit and they agreed (thankfully).We ordered the eggplant dip appetizer with the foccacia served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar (extra $). Delicious, and liked the crudites the dip was served with. Great for sharing. Drinks are overpriced, to be expected with any of these types of restaurants. For mains, we ordered from their specialties; the chicken gnocchi and the meatballs. The meatballs were... good meatballs lol I guess it's just not my thing. But the gnocchi plate was unique and borderline bizarre. I can't say that I loved the flavour profile but I like that I ate something special and thoughtful. It was strangely sweet and salty... but I felt it was too sweet for me. For dessert, we tried the tiramisu and chocolate cake. Both delicious but I've had better.I was expecting a lot from this place based on rep (of which the name I still cannot pronounce!) but overall, I don't know that I was wowed or would go back for the price."
/user_details?userid=VXhoHN-G3kxrNKgnP4Li6w,Todd Z.,"Hull, IA",5 star rating,"Came in on a Wednesday evening and we were seated immediately.  The terrace is nice, but it is along a busy street, so we went inside and were put by the window inside. This is a small plates restaurant, so we ordered four courses which included dessert.  We were hungry, but not starved, so it was just right. Bonus was $5 glasses of Prosecco since they were celebrating their one year anniversary.We had three dishes--the burrata, Caesar salad, and the gnocchi. We finished with the olive oil cake with rhubarb.  The burrata with the focaccia and the gnocchi were both amazingly fresh and delicious. Dill, parsley, and basil really made the dishes spring to life.  The olive oil cake was moist and light and the poached rhubarb were deliciously paired and a great finish.Our server was very helpful and provided great recommendations. Such a good evening. I highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In the heart of old Montreal, this small Italian themed café perfectly fits in to heart of the city.  Dimmed lights will invite you into their cozy seating (available at the bar or tables). Reservations can be made using OpenTable with no wait time for seating. The staff is great and attentive. They'll hear a drop of a fork a mile away and replace it without even asking for it.I highly enjoyed the menu, particularly the house specials will leave you wanting more. The evening concept here is shareable platters-so don't come alone unless you have a big appetite. Prices are competitively fair for the quality of food. To start off we ordered wine by the glass (12-15$) with a side of olives (9$). For our main courses: the burrata(26$) comes on a bed of cold hierloom tomatoes, onion and basil (5/5); the bruschetta (17$)comes in 3 pieces topped with sautéd mixed mushrooms,herbs, garlic mascarpone the portion were too small for the price (3/5); the house special of butternut squash salad with pickles and freshly sliced apples was a hit (5/5). I don't remember the price of this item- but it was excellent dish. I strongly recommend asking for the house specials from your server. For dessert- I had a traditional affogato that was a great way to end the meal- a bittersweet ending literally. I will definitely come back here especially for the upcoming cold winter days!"

Same food quality and service you will find at Olive + Gourmando.First was in the middle of afternoon after a visit to Scandinave Spa next door. We were not drinking but we had this amazing strawberry-balsamic-basil drink. We were literally waiting for the ice to melt in our glass to sip our drinks to the last drop ! Food was as amazing as our drinks. I had the Al Forno plate, an amazing breakfast with winter veggies, their foccacia and ricotta. There was this delicious tomato sauce on my plate, we asked for  extra sauce on the side to dip the focaccia bread. They kindly brought it and didn't charge anything for it even when I mentioned it was not on the bill. We could not stop ordering food. Everything was just literally perfect, we had two desserts, the olive oil cake and the torta caprese and both both were just incredible. Their creativity and flavors are to die for. I went the second time for aperitivo. I was with friends with allergies and they easily found stuff on the menu they could eat. Drinks were delicious. I had 2 negronis and a delicatta squash plate that was so good. I just want to go again for the brunch."

I was excited to come because Olive et Gourmando is so good and I really enjoyed the foccacia at Foxy. This place is gorgeous! Love the décor and the vibe!! I think it's a cute place to bring a date but also a nice with a small group of friends. I started with the Spritz cocktail and my friend had the negroni. The cocktails were good. We then switched to wine. I had a red from Tuscany and my friend had an orange wine. They do not have a big menu. We shared some oysters, a plate burrata and the bruschetta plate. The burrata was accompanied by roasted carrots and rapini. The bruschetta is not your typical onion and tomato bruschetta. It consisted of mixed mushrooms and garlic marscapone. I liked both dishes and the size was pretty good. I expected it to be smaller but for the price I am glad it was bigger than expected because it was not cheap! We were both full after."

/user_details?userid=MlWOOCa8ew3FD5Ded5DbcA,Sarah O.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I wanted to check this place out on our first night in Montreal since it was recommended on Eater. The pork belly dish and the gnocchi with squash and chicken were out-of-this-world amazing. The rigatoni was just okay. I should have stopped ordering there. The torta (chocolate cake) was dry and bland and the buttermilk ice cream was also disappointing in taste. I left feeling disappointed that I had wasted the money and the calories on the extremely disappointing dessert. I highly recommend the pork belly and the gnocchi, but perhaps order something else, like the burrata and the prosciutto, to fill you up."
/user_details?userid=BboLVvhDgJYKRiWwZrpJxQ,Marie K.,"Dayton, OH",4 star rating,"My impression online was that this was more of a cocktail bar, but it is not, it is a restaurant - we were promptly corrected on this misunderstanding. You must order some type of food item, you cannot order only cocktails. They also have a very limited bar, Italian products only (ex: they don't have vodka). If you come here knowing what to expect you'll have a good experience and avoid the sharpness of the staff when you ask to just have cocktails. We settled on the burrata and focaccia to accompany our cocktails - both were fabulous. The restaurant has great decor as well. I'm only docking them because of how sharp the staff was when we first arrived."

If you are a negroni fan, I recommend stopping by for a cocktail. Only issue for me was that the price point, especially for drinks, was a little high.

The courge delicata and the gnocchi were fabulous - we split each of them and then moved on to dessert. For dessert, we had the torte caprese and the crostata. Out of the two, we preferred the torte caprese which was not too rich and had good flavor. It was a pleasant meal. You could definitely order more plates but for us this was perfect. Don't skip the focaccia with EVOO and balsamic - it's extraordinary!"

My bf and I shared 3 dishes in total: the eggplant dip, the porchetta and the meatballs. The eggplant dip had the same texture as guacamole, it tasted quite nice but slightly over-salted. There were ~8 pieces of fresh & crunchy veggies that came with it, for 10$ -  imo, a bit pricey for the portion we got. The porchetta tasted good -although my taste buds would've  been more satisfied if the pork belly slices were more tender & juicy. As for the meatballs, they were cooked in a tomato-based sauce and came with a yummy crispy bread on the side. For 15$, this dish was enjoyable, however a bit pricey as there were only 3 meatballs."

Very generous portions and everything was delicious. We then moved on to some other plates to share--burrata with blanched greens, focaccia, and crudité with an eggplant dip, followed by a veg lasagna, the rigatoni with meatballs, and a tuna salad. There is a nice lightness to many of the dishes--lots of love for vegetables here--and it makes for a beautifully balanced meal. We had the homemade trio of ice cream to finish (buttermilk, chocolate and pistachio, with the latter flavour being outta this world). There is a great cocktail list focused on negroni, spritzes and a good selection of amaros. Bitter liqueur heaven! We will be back for sure, probably sooner rather than later."

The food was fresh, healthy and delicious, and Dominick was very attentive and friendly.  We enjoyed it so much we returned the next morning!  Here's the kicker - when he learned that we were headed to Quebec City, he said he would speak to chef and other coworkers from Quebec City and get some restaurant recommendations. We returned for breakfast the next day, and he was ready: pulled a list from his pocket.
