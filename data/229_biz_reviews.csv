Feels like everyone had the same idea of opening pizza joints in the mile end at the same time. This place isn't like slice + soda and Toni's though because they do a full pie and not slices. Didn't get a chance to try one out but love the creativity in the menu. I tried the garlic bread on my visit and it was delicious. Airy potato bread sprinkled with parmesan cheese. So warm and filling and fluffy. This is the second location of this chain and it's more focused on takeout rather than dine in. As for Covid measures, there is no plexiglass but there is a maximum of 4 customers allowed inside and masks are mandatory."
