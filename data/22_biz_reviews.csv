We arrived about an hour early and decided to wait in their sister restaurant Le Vin Papillon and have a glass of wine (also a great place!!). We went to Joe Beef just as they were opening and the waitress said they were booked with reservations so we couldn't even wait. Very disappointed, we stepped into the hallway to find another place to eat but then the waitress came back and told us if we could eat within 1 hour she could seat us at a larger table that had a reservation at 6 so we jumped on the opportunity. We ordered oysters to start which were very fresh. My boyfriend got the filet mignon and I got the beef tartare. My beef tartare was very flavorful and unexpectedly filling. The filet mignon was very tender. They had a great selection of wine and the staff is very knowledgeable about the list. Although we had make sure we were out in 1 hour, boy did we enjoy the hell out of our meal. I'm looking forward to the day I can return to this amazing restaurant."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Joe beef is a MTL institution and one of my favorite restaurants. As of the first week of May, Joe beef has returned for takeout amidst the covid-19 crisis. They have an awesome menu with lots of options from appetizers, to mains to sides to desserts. All of their dishes have minimal prep and instructions are on the website.We decided to try the homemade sauces with lentils, the lentil salad, the ribs and bread. Everything was absolutely delicious. I can't pick a favorite dish, I loved all of them equally! Their bread though, exceeded my expectations. I was expecting regular dinner rolls but these buns were magic! We also ordered their fruit and vegetables seeds as a gift for mother's day. Looking forward to seeing the results this summer."

Came here sat on the patio and trust me order the aoili and the smoked trout. The merengue dessert was unreal too. Second best dessert I ever had. I had the joe beef dinner and it was more of a roast than steak (more of a heads up if anything) but everything was amazing. Go here
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ugh the lobster spaghetti was so good! I wish I could say it wasn't so that I don't have a craving to go back all the time. And we also tried the new york steak, and a pasta dish with duck hearts. It was my first time having duck hearts but the taste was not at all overwhelming or gross. So happy with the quality of food here and the flavours they serve up. The boyfriend and I opted to order 2 separate desserts to share between us and they were really great too. The thing is that their menu often will change based on the season and what's available. The pricing too for that matter. I'm always budget-conscious and like knowing around how much I'll spend beforehand, so that was at first something that made me hesitate. But feel free to look around the at many menu pictures people have uploaded online. You can kind of gauge how much a particular dish would be. I was actually pleasantly surprised that the lobster spaghetti was cheaper than I had anticipated since I suppose the market price of lobster was more in season when I went."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I ate in their lovely garden outside. It was getting cold, but they had heating lamps, which was very appreciated.The service was excellent, the waitress had great wine recommendations. The decor was very scenic and romantic. Most importantly, the food was spot on. The lamb ribs and fries were my absolute favourite. The ribs were smoked with a nice dry rub and formed a crusty exterior, but the meat was melt-in-your-mouth. The beef tartare was perfectly seasoned, fresh, simple and highly recommended. The olive oil they used was excellent and had a nice bite at the end of it. The entrées were delicious, the oysters were very fresh.Last but not least, the desserts were heavenly. The pear chocolate tart and the stuffed rolls (see picture) were out of this world. It was worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=rLh63PoxknAV52w5IkmcQA,Crystina S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is most definitely not overhyped. The atmosphere is very relaxed, the wait staff are knowledgeable in everything they serve and will take you through the whole menu (as it's written on the wall and often not easy to read depending on where you're sitting), and make excellent recommendations.The smoked meat croquettes are a must have, and the lobster spaghetti is their signature dish for a reason. I hate lobster and I enjoyed it. I ordered the hanger steak, cooked to perfection with a gorgeous sauce that perfectly coated the meat. Only downside is the drinks. I'm a tequila lover and they don't really do your standard mixed drinks so I had a tequila sour which was basically just tequila on ice with a tiny spritz of lime juice.EDIT.... review number two... went with a new person this time around, made the reservation months ago via their website which took me to Bookenda. We arrive and they have no record of the reservation, saying that they haven't used Bookenda for months. Never the less, they gave us a table right away, which was so impressive! This time we had oysters, sturgeon croquettes, lobster spaghetti as appetizers, horse with bone marrow and radish, and a NY strip with cauliflower and curd cheese. Everything was spectacular! Cannot stress enough that this place is amazing.Review # 3... Joe Beef started doing take out in light of COVID. My friend and I placed our order online. Lamb, beef, bread and dessert. Everything comes pre-cooked and sealed with instructions on how to heat and plate. It was packaged so nicely with everything we would need, and, even though the meal wasn't quite as good as it would have been in the restaurant, it was a great Saturday night meal, and an awesome way to support this Montreal staple!"

My husband ordered steak and they made truffle pasta for me which was delicious. Hubby loved the steak. He highly recommends checking this place out if you love steak.

When you have the kind of pedigree that Joe Beef has, it can be hard to live up to the lofty expectations, but I came away impressed!The lobster spaghetti blew all of us away and was the standout dish. The steak was a tad grizzly and fatty but the dry aged meaty flavor of the beef was amazing and the french fries were some of the best I've had."
/user_details?userid=BWZzuWmB-s9RJG_qDsuo3g,Christina L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Joe Beef was literally the restaurant highlight of my Montreal trip. I know that Anthony Bourdain (RIP) featured this on one of his shows, so I knew I had to watch it. The food and beer are locally sourced, which is a great way to help the town. I got the local beer which the waitress recommended and it was perfect. There is also an extensive wine list on the wall. The waitress was extremely helpful explaining the menu (which changes daily and listed on the wall and in French)."
/user_details?userid=azZdNaUfeb8J9H1k_aoWJQ,Agnes W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"It's as good as they say it is! Joe Beef is a great place to go to when you want to indulge in great food and treat yourself to a delicious meal. It is crucial to make a reservation as early as possible since they are basically fully booked every single night. I waited until the date opened up on their reservation calendar to book a dinner for my husband and I. As we perused the menu on the chalkboard, it was hard to know what to get since everything looked and sounded good. The waitress was really helpful in describing the dishes we were interested in and also helped us in narrowing down to different choices. We shared a foie gras torchon with confit apples as the appetizer. I really enjoyed the pairing of the foie gras and the confit. I personally really love foie gras so any way it comes in I am pretty happy with. For mains, my husband got the braised oxtail with escargot and I got the lobster spaghetti. Both different, but packed with unique flavours that make you reach for a bite of each others even when you're too full. We loved the tenderness of the oxtail and the escargot. It was paired very well with vegetables and mashed potatoes on top. The lobster spaghetti was rich in all the right ways. It was tossed in a lobster bisque sauce and was amazing. We were too full for dessert, but the dessert on other tables looked good. The waitress was also very helpful in pairing drinks and had an excellent recommendation for a white wine with my lobster spaghetti. Would definitely recommend this place to people visiting Montreal or looking for a special place to celebrate!"
/user_details?userid=h0uDDltgg-nRNCj5ni_VuQ,Andrea K.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place is always fully booked three months in advance but it is absolutely worth it. Their menu changes based on what's in season. I've been three times and every time the food is cooked to perfection. Portions are generous and fairly priced.
/user_details?userid=op8d9geoz8oeBseVAqiPNg,Veronica Y.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"What can I say that others haven't already? First, if you know you're going to be in Montreal at least three months in advance, then MAKE A RESERVATION! If it's more than three months out, then set an alert. I had a reservation for a group of 6 -- we showed up, waited about 5 minutes and then got seated. We definitely got some dirty looks from other people waiting who did not have reservations. But that's why you gotta make a reservation! We ordered: - Beef tartare with smoked eel: AMAZING- we were super tempted to get a second one. - Smoked meat croquettes: simply delightful- Oysters: PEI, beach gem, and chiasson. Can't go wrong with oysters.- Foie gras tarte: it was good but the jello type thing on top was weird and it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I would pass on this next time. - Fries with blue cheese: the fries here ARE SO GOOD- Lobster spaghetti: SUPER STAR YES! But also be careful - it's REALLY filling and rich, so pace yourself here! - Scallops fried in duck fat: So buttery and tender. Each scallops was also sitting on top of some sort of meat, and also had new potatoes -- a well balanced plate. - Duck: This was WONDERFUL. Perfectly rare/medium-rare cook, great sear, topped with an egg and some greens for balance. Great jus. They had so many other delicious sounding dishes too -- some that were a little more ""out there"" that I would have loved to try had my co-diners been more adventurous. All the drinks we ordered were great. The whole bill came out to about $480 canadian dollars for the 6 of us. What a steal for this level of dining!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. I've only been here three times but I thoroughly enjoyed it all three times. It's not cheap but I definitely recommend it for special occasions or for a fancy date. Reservations are hard to get so you have to reserve online many many weeks in advance. I took my boyfriend to Joe Beef for his birthday because he had never been before. I could only get reservations for 9 pm on a Tuesday night so I took whatever I could get. Everything was delicious! I remember back in the day they used to have the double down. Omg I used to love that! I love everything with foie gras! I am so bummed they removed it from the menu. I started with a Bloody Caesar. It comes with an oyster on top. So good! I then switched to red wine and it so good as well. Too bad they don't sell the wine at the SAQ. We got the tongue escargot entrée, the lobster pasta and horse meat with a side of fries. My boyfriend was worried that the tongue would taste weird or have a weird texture but it definitely did not. The meat was so tender.The lobster pasta is amazing and comes with a lot of lobster. It's very filling. The horse meat was also very delicious! My boyfriend realIy enjoyed this dish. I personally really enjoy horse meat as bad as that sounds. Oh try the fries! I love the dressing on top and the spicy mayo it comes with. We were too full for dessert so we didn't get any.  I highly recommend this restaurant! If you haven't been yet you need to go!"
/user_details?userid=6yCHD-4YwGVK-Xrq3fG2Dw,Janice W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place as I read it was one of the top restaurants in Canada. It's good but not to die for- and here are my reasons why. It was hard to get a spot. In order for us to get a reservation we reserved 3 months in advanced and set an alarm on our phones the moment the reservation was available online. Despite being so strategic our reservation was only slotted for 9:30. Despite having a later seating they had everything on the menu except one dessert item. We ordered the lobster pasta- which we were told is always on the menu. Cote de beouf which was delightful and we opted for a side of fries. Because it was B.C. spot prawn season we also got an appetizer that featured the spot prawns and it was grilled which I thought was okay, but since they were fresh spot prawns I would have preferred to have it made a different way to have the freshness stand out.Overall the meal was great, but if you didn't get a reso when you visit Montreal I wouldn't sweat it as there are many lovely restaurants to go to as well!"
/user_details?userid=26WgdHfEjWj4BrN-cUNhVw,Debbie P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is almost impossible to make reservations but we lucked out with a cancellation and got ourselves a spot for 5:30 pm.Duck tartare ($25)My first time having duck tartar and it was absolutely delicious! the meat was tender and it was mixed in with crispy duck skin which added excellent crunch in each bite. in the center was a piece of the duck liver essentially it was like a foiegras pate which smoothens out the texture with the meat.I'm normally not a fan of things with orange flavour but this orange touch added a nice citrus taste to the whole dish.Lobster spaghetti ($40)This is their signature dish. Pasta was aldente, sauce was rich and creamy, kind of reminded me of a carbonara tasted but mixed in with slight lobster taste I assume, which explains the light orange colour. You can evidently build pieces of the half lobster which is much better than having bits and pieces mixed into the pasta. Although I do wish there was more of a seafood lobstery taste in the pasta sauce.Seared quail with clams ($37)This dish was my least favorite. The clams were large and a bit too chewy. There were a couple of clams that were baked stuffed with bread crumbs and mixed spinach. The flavour and taste of the quail was good, meat was juicy, not dry at all. Sauce had a hint of of lemony taste. The price is expensive but the food quality was there and definitely worth the price giving it is Canada's #2 restaurant.Service was good, waiter was friendly and attentive."

Save your money and space in your tummy for other items.  Overall, this is a must do in Montreal.  It's expensive..but so worth the splurge."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Joe Beef is the King of Montreal restaurants and the #3 restaurant in the country for good reason. Like Liverpool House next door, they do certain things here that other restaurants cannot even approach. Their mission involves a deep respect for ingredients and an ever changing menu pushing the boundaries of food and broadening horizons. They believe in using the whole animal and serve a menu that is both rooted in classical French and Canadian traditions. Everything is very good. I know many people get a kick out of telling the waiter to ""make it rain"" thereby letting him/her design a tasting menu for you. While this option is appreciated, I prefer to order my own meal.My wife and I had a 5:30pm reservation this past Saturday night to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. To even get a 5:30pm reservation (not ideal), I had to book it 3 months in advance.For the first 10 minutes, service was non-existent. All of the sudden however, our waiter and a team of no less than 3 other food-runners/busboys/sommeliers, burst into action pampering us for the next 2 hours and 45 minutes. They are very big on suggesting the food and wine you should have. We took some of their suggestions and ignored some others (particularly when it came to choosing wines). They put up with us and were extremely friendly all night long. The menus are not printed out and are only available on the chalkboard. As they change so often, I feel it is incumbent upon Yelp reviewers to post updated pictures every week so people can do a bit of prep work before showing up for dinner.I started with a classic bloody caesar while my wife got the Moscow mule which was not too sweet and very well balanced. The oyster served atop my caesar was so fresh and vibrant, we decided to order 6 more (oysters, not bloody caesars!)For appetizers we enjoyed the raw scallops served in a buttery lemon sauce with toasted almonds. These were so light and delicious, we ordered a second plate of them. I also tried the foie gras torchon with confit apples. It was tasty, but I would have thought they would serve some toasted bread along side it. We had already ordered some rye bread with a Moishes pickle (tasted like one..) but had polished off the plate before the fatty liver arrived.We also shared a small dish of roasted quail legs with some fresh calamari and white beans. It was slightly crispy and tasted like a classic barbecued chicken, only more rich and tender. This dish really shows how versatile Joe Beef is with their cooking techniques. It's one thing to master a dish and train people to prepare it properly with the right equipment. To show you can master about 25 different dishes every single week with the same finesse and respect for each new ingredient is completely revolutionary. For mains, I chose the duck magret served with a sausage made from duck heart. It was beyond delicious. You have got to trust these guys when eating here and throw away your hangups. The rewards are plentiful. The duck was cooked and sliced to a beautiful medium rare, while the sausage tasted rich and very flavourful (similar to brisket). The whole dish was coated in a rich sauce. We also split the classic Joe Beef fries which are done in beef fat and served with chopped garlic and mayo. These guys know their way around a french fry.For dessert we had the classic Marjolaine hazelnut layer cake which as advertised everywhere was next level delicious and rich. The stunner however was their homemade ice cream sundae of the week which is hard to describe. I think it had crumbled pistachios amongst other ingredients. Just look at my picture. I don't need to use words.To cap it off, during the meal, we noticed Mr. McMillan standing right by our table for a brief moment. With his heavily tattooed arms and newly slimmed frame, He stood there briefly with a quiet confidence to him. He seemed to be enjoying life, gazing at the packed room and what he had accomplished. I didn't bother him, but if he reads this, he and Fred should know how much respect and appreciation I have for them both."
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",5 star rating,"While a Quebecois blizzard whirled just outside, my husband and I nestled into our window table in the original space in the restaurant.  Occasionally rubbing the glass to peer outside,  and our feet warmed by the heater near our ankles, we had a grand view of the spectacle that is Joe Beef.  When a restaurant has the reputation (#2 in Canada) that this one does, the atmosphere and the vibe are every bit as important as the food.  We taste with all our senses.  It's a marriage, in my view, of a truly spectacular experience.  It can be had eating bar food and street food as well, not just fine dining.  When it all flows, then it is a supreme experience .  Joe Beef delivers on all fronts.  Darkly lit, romantic, buzzing, and superior service set the mood for the main event, the food.  We started with escargot - so buttery - and shared an endive salad that was off the charts.  Two orders of croquettes de fromage just because I can't resist a croquette. My entree (plat) was piled high with buttery lobster carbonara and my husband's rare filet mignon with roasted baby potatoes and spinach was excellent.  Our taste buds were exploding, sharing bits of our own personal surf and turf.  Though we didn't have room, we ordered a slice of the 24 layer Marjolaine cake, with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  It was not cloying sweet, but I would have preferred just a little more hazelnut chocolate with my espresso.  Our bill was quite high, notwithstanding two cocktails and two glasses of wine.  Joe Beef has been on my radar for over a decade, so it was worth the wait.  And the expense. Indulge yourselves!"
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We had a great time at Joe Beef. We opted to trust the waiter for the food we ordered. We had one pescatarian and one person who didn't eat shrimp, so they adapted their selection to fit our needs. Great service and wine pairings. Great ambiance, very cozy. We got a lot of plates so I can't list them all, but everything was definitely very good. However, I wouldn't give it 5 stars because only one plate surprised me. It was a sort of raw salmon with a butter sauce (appetizer), which was incredibly impressive. I also thought it lacked a bit of vegetable options / lighter plates. Lots of plates included meat - it made the meal become more 'heavy' than it should, in my opinion. I would have liked to eat more but felt full very fast. I'd go again for sure, but maybe ask for a lighter selection. The fact you have to make a reservation months ahead kind of creates over-expectation for what it is. It was great, but it wasn't a culinary discovery for me. I recommend it :)"

/user_details?userid=iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We had essentially planned an entire trip to Montreal around a reservation at Joe Beef, so to say there was a lot riding on the experience would be a serious understatement.It did not disappoint.We arrived right on time and were immediately shown to a sweet booth near the front of the restaurant. A quick perusal at the blackboard menu was a little overwhelming, to be honest, so when our waitress introduced herself, we decided to put ourselves in her hands and let her plan our meal.It turned out to be the exact right choice.We were ultimately given a multitude of amazing, flawless courses, starting with, quite literally, the best oysters I've ever eaten. I have no idea what they did differently to these things, but the oysters were far meatier and tastier than what I've come to expect. A seriously strong start.From there, we were taken through a journey in food, essentially. I'm not going to list everything we ate (because this review would become pages and pages long), but there were definitely several highlights I want to point out.One of the more impressive appetizers we received were the Croquettes d'anguille fumee de Kamouraska, which arrived to the table piping hot and filled with some kind of seafood. I easily could've gobbled up about a hundred of these things.We were also each given a bowl of their Soupe froide de petits pois & joues de fletan, which was essentially cold pea soup. I've had pea soup before but never at this level. The depth of flavor was absolutely incredible, and the pieces of seafood in there were pretty much perfect.Another astounding course was a dish comprised of sweetbreads and tongue, and good lord was this incredible. The thinly-sliced tongue was so tender and flavorful, while the deep-fried sweetbreads were nothing short of mindblowing and weren't, as I might have feared, dominated by that heavy, unpleasant mineral taste generally associated with this sort of thing.When we first began looking at the intimidating menu, we were all hoping to get the Spaghetti homard-lobster and when it arrived to the table, we were overjoyed (to put it mildly). And it was definitely worth the wait. Although the lobster itself wasn't exactly plentiful, the perfectly-cooked pasta was rich with flavor and intensity. This would've been a fine dish to just eat by oneself, that's for sure.From there, we were presented with a trio of meat courses - including rabbit and pork. To say that these were incredible would be putting it extremely mildly. The pork, especially, was cooked perfectly and contained a smoky, dry-aged flavor that I found irresistible.At this point, we were pretty much stuffed but the food kept coming. We received an amazing cheese plate packed with some of the best cheeses I've ever tasted, and, of course, a dessert course. I'll admit I wasn't super blown away by either of the desserts, but that might just be because I was impossibly full by that point.I want to also single out the efforts of our waitress, who was absolutely incredible all night and who took the time to explain our various courses and drink options. (Oh, we drank a *lot* too.)I can see why Joe Beef is considered one of the best restaurants in Canada, if not the world. They offer an experience that's pretty much unparalleled. I can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=OBWQBu8A0TZ1dNofSUK2hQ,Bella M.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Unfortunately had a very unpleasant experience here. Appetizers were mostly good - had the jello egg and foie gras. The egg dish tasted bland but the foie gras was amazing, but they only serve it with one piece of toast which is not nearly enough for the amount of foie gras. The mains were very disappointing. The fish came cold and I had to ask the waiter if it was supposed to be served cold - no it wasn't, he took it away to remake it. I had to sit and wait for it to be remade while my partner ate his main course. He ordered the lamb shoulder which was good but the portion was unreasonably big, a very heavy dish. When my fish finally arrived, it was great and the sauce was amazing however the clams that accompanied it were grainy, full of sand, which was gross. Since the restaurant is so big and popular now, no one cared about our negative experience."
/user_details?userid=mWoUYscHQgPcxnPxiCWiWw,Cassandra G.,"Nepean, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"My first visit to Joe Beef this weekend came with very high hopes provided by my boyfriend's constant raving about this place, however they managed to still blow me away. The food was absolutely amazing, unlike anything I've ever had. The staff work in such a seamless team structure that you are never in need of anything. To my amazement, every staff member was aware of what we had ordered and was able to make cutlery adjustments and wine suggestions based on their memorization of our choices. This level of attention to detail is what makes the entire experience one of a kind and so memorable!We ordered the ""morilles farcies, bacon et ail des bois"" and the horse tartare to start. The morels were out of this world, so flavourful! The tartare was also very good and beautifully prepared. For our mains I ordered the classic lobster spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the pork shoulder, we were both incredibly happy with our choices! We finished the night with their amazing hazelnut layer cake, a classic French traditional desert. I cannot wait to return and will be suggesting this restaurant to anybody who is looking for an incredible meal with astounding service in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,Joy B.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"When I saw two jolly guys on television traveling with their own stash of truffles on a train jaunt through the Québécois countryside, I knew I needed to visit whatever restaurant they were hawking on the show. ""Those guys"" were chef-owners David McMillan and Fred Morin and ""that restaurant"" turned out to be Joe Beef, so there I went on a recent trip to Montreal.Together Chefs McMillan and Morin co-helm this celebrated restaurant, opened in 2005 and inspired by Chef Martin Picard's Au Pied de Cochon and the bistros of Paris. Like neighboring Au Pied de Cochon, Joe Beef is dedicated to epic and excess eating and drinking. Few places in the world promote gluttony quite like Montreal, and Joe Beef definitely adds to if not helps lead the over-the-top food culture in this part of Canada.A clear theme of broadening horizons and embracing unusual ingredients was evident during my visit. First up was an appetizer of buffalo mozzarella with squash (mozzarella de buffalone), two foods I'm very fond of but had never eaten together. The dish highlighted squash in several forms: delicata rings, roasted butternut squash, butternut squash puree, and toasted pumpkin seeds all drizzled with a classic ravigote sauce. The char on the warm grilled vegetables worked insanely well with the cool, creamy mozzarella, a seeming study of contrasts that I would enjoy again any day.Yes folks, horse (filet de cheval) and eel (croquettes d'anguilles) were on the menu. I however went with a dish of pork shoulder, squid, and clams (echine de cochon, calmars, et palourdes) for my main entree, again an unexpected combination that worked surprisingly well in tandem. Pork is not normally my protein of choice, especially when there are several variations of beef on the menu, and especially not paired with seafood, but this particular preparation created a dish that I would most assuredly eat (inhale) again. Cooked for 48 hours, the pork was so tender that I thought I was chewing butter. The accompanying saffron-rich sauce was thick and decadent and contained no dairy, even though the creaminess factor would suggest otherwise. My dining partner meanwhile enjoyed a dish considered to be a Joe Beef staple--Spaghetti Homard-Lobster, served in a reduction of lobster cream sauce and bacon and featuring easily some of the freshest lobster I've tried anywhere.Dessert consisted of a chocolate tart (tarte au chocolat), served as chocolate ganache topped with whipped cream inside a flakey sweet pastry crust. Drinks at the beginning of the meal included rum-infused orange cocktails, a refreshing prelude to a most-fabulous and memorable meal. Much of the menu changes every 30 days or sometimes by the hour. Coming up with interesting menu combinations rooted in whatever happens to be available at the market on any given day is a testament to the experience and skill of the Joe Beef team, of which every member is an integral part of the operation. A job at Joe Beef, whether you're the head chef, operator of the fry station, or a member of the front-of-the-house staff is a long-term calling. This investment and professionalism is felt by customers in spades when servers can speak knowledgeably about dishes, since they've been briefed on every aspect of the menu and can therefore answer questions, talk about food preparation and ingredients, and make good recommendations as a result. Service during our meal was impeccable from start to finish.It goes without saying that what a restaurant puts out should be great, but in order to provide value and entice either the first-time visitor or the repeat guest, what they deliver in terms of food and service needs to be special and not something you can get anywhere else. Joe Beef delivers that sort of holistic ""dining experience"" and is most worthy of a stop, preferably several over the course of a lifetime.Pro-tip: Make sure to pay a visit to the little boy's or girl's room while you're here. You'll be kept company by a life-size buffalo while you tinkle."
/user_details?userid=_JO5lnXPnvJTjPZUp92A7g,Traci C.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"The much recommended dinner came with a 7/10 score. The apply - veal liver with charcuterie sauce: intereting but over seasoned. The main - the infamous lobster spaghetti: perfectly poached lobster but under seasoned pasta. Highlights were the side of butternut squash gratin and dessert of poach pear with financier drizzled chocolate sauce and maple cream. The issue with the whole dinner was the service. I acknowledge that we don't speak French fluently but we try to throw in a few words here and there as recommended by other travelers. I was trying to order veal liver (foie) with veal tongue. He said something in French and asked both? We figured it was referring to the liver and the tongue. When an order of foie grad torching came, we were confused. We alerted our waiter and he became argumentative. From there on out, he never checked in with us nor serve any dishes other than when he came back to ask for our dessert order. When we received our bill, the torchon was still on the bill. It took us 10 minutes to flag him down and he apologize for the oversight. Also, one of the smaller washroom was nasty. Smells like a back alley.We would have given a higher rating if not for the subpar service we received. #overrated"

/user_details?userid=sRqJazR7G4RkFSqpFLx9Dw,Brooke M.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"Eating here makes me want to go back to all my previous reviews and change any 5-Star rated restaurants to 3 stars, but that wouldn't be fair because not everyone can be held to the ultimate gold standard. And yes, this is it. Everything was so deliciously perfect, each bite was like the first. The place is cozy, totally unpretentious, with very friendly & helpful staff. The menu is on a chalkboard, in French only, but don't let that deter you if you can't read/speak French. The staff is so helpful and will provide great recommendations. I highly recommend splitting some apps and sharing a plate with a couple of sides. Try things you would never cook at home. Don't go with anything ""safe"". This is a place you go and trust the chefs...they know what they're doing. You will not regret anything about this experience. And if they still have the Beer Can Cauliflower on the menu THEN YOU GET THE BEER CAN CAULIFLOWER."

I ordered the lobster pasta and my husband ordered the steak, oysters, and fries. My lobster pasta was bland & looking back at the other yelp pictures, they also had only given me 3 small lobster pieces. For $44 that's pretty over priced. & my complaint is more so about the fact that the sauce wasn't all that tasty, so lobster was all I was able to eat.  My husband's steak and oysters were amazing though. The fries were tasty,but oily. Customer service was good BUT she didn't tell us what was on the full menu, as we heard the other waiter telling the group next to us about 10 dishes that she never mentioned.  I understand that we're Americans in Montreal and the whole menu was in French and servers  dont want to recite the whole menu to every American customer,but c'mon.  We got to hear about 1/4 of what was available.  So maybe it would be easier for everyone to have a menu in English also."

This was my second time here and it was still the same dining experience I remembered and loved. I was here with a group of 6 people. Because I'm the picky one in the group, I ordered my own food, while everyone else shared. Being a steak eater, I had to get the steak...and it was fantastic! I got an order of their delicious fried too. I did get to try some of the other plates that my friends shared. Everything was fantastic. I have to say the service is top notch. The waiter knew the menu inside out and described everything for us. He recommended a couple of great bottles of wine too that we shared. You are definitely taken care of when you're there. Have to add one more thing. The atmosphere in the restaurant is part of the dining experience. It's a cool, relaxed, and casual vibe...just a fun place to hang out for the 2-3 hours that you spend there. It's definitely NOT one of those pretentious restaurants that I'm not such a fan of.

I was not disappointed!There's no actual menu. Everything is listed on a chalkboard. This is a bit inconvenient, as people sitting at the banquet won't be able to read it. So we actually have to move around to read what's on the menu and then go back to your seat. Since their menu changes, I suppose it's the best way for them... not for customers though.The service was great! All along, they made sure that everything was fine. They would change our plates/utensils between each dish to make our tasting experience better without contamination!Food was good! As entree, i tried the seared scallop and the smoke meat croquette. Both was amazing! As the main dish, of course we took the lobster spaghetti, it's as good as you can imagine! However, to eat that plate alone, I probably won't be able to finish it. The sauce was a but heavy. Also tried the deer neck with foie gras. I was disappointed with that dish. It was way too salty. Only took 2-3 bites and couldn't take it anymore. When you eat it along with some foie gras, the saltiness is a bit less bad... as of the dessert, it was amazing! Orange farci avec Five Alive. Basically sorbet in an orange with marshmallow on top! Very refreshing (especially after all the salt ingested...)! Was definitely a good pick!"

The dining experience I had at your place was a truly memorable. Maybe because I was on vacation and usually don't dine like this when at home, however the decor and vibe of the restaurant was special.  First of all, waiting for our table to be ready, we were guided to your rear patio next to the outdoor grill area where some of the meals are prepared to enjoy bottles of wine and cocktails.I couldn't help but notice your very own garden where I'm sure you grow the vegetables you use in your place. I'm sure if I searched closer I'd find some ganja trees, but no judgement here if there were. Your fine staff took care of us from the very beginning to the bittersweet end, even shared a few drinks with some of them in the middle of our dining experience and got to meet the chef you transported from NYC. We were happy with the variety of menu items we selected from your chalkboard menu, and although it was in French, that was fine since I polished up on my food items before my trip.From the appetizers including the salami whatever dish, lamb ragu, the bread with foie gras jelly, duck fat fries, the tiny fried fish. To the main dishes which included the lobster spaghetti and the grassfed bone-in semi-overpriced meat. Then the grand finale of the 4 course dessert menu which we could have passed on but so glad we didn't because it was the fitting way to close out the night.Mr. Beef, your name is perfect ... Don't ever change.  Well change just a little because if you stay the same, you know you're not growing. The only constant and life is change so keep it up and I'll be sure to come back next time I'm in Montreal.Merci beaucoup ...Je t'aime,Bong E."

In true Montreal bistro style. the food is essentially French and dishes are stand alone complete with accompanying sides and sauce.  Portions are large.  Autumn brings game and the menu offered it in abundance.  A gamy yet sweet, dark and lean tartare of venison, a simple but sublime starter.  An excellent thick, meaty, dense, aged breast of duck finished in a creamy peppercorn sauce and topped by an egg.  The aging greatly concentrates the flavor of the duck,  as it's kept moist by an umami rich fat.  Finally a roasted guinea fowl with its just cooked, dark, gamy flesh also finishing with a hint of natural sweetness.It wouldn't be French without a silky smooth, foie torchon with apples, whole grain mustard and bitter dandelion greens.  The foie having a hint of sauternes that compliments the very mild livery taste and extreme fat content.  Finally, a large dish of braised oxtail and escargot finished in the classic escargot garlic, parsley butter.  Tender, light beef flavor indicative of Canadian beef, and just good eats.Very well chosen wines focusing on all regions of France.  All very approachable and pair well with the food.   Average bottle price, 70CAD.Servers look casual but know their stuff.  Zero complaints.Two month advance reservations required.A cutting edge bistro that speaks to Montreal."

We went on a busy weekend evening and for sure, and despite reservations, had to still wait 30 minutes--it was not an issue. The service here is exceptional for such a delightful bistro. Additionally, the horse steak and horse sausage was amazing. Loved every bite.  Friend decided on the lobster spaghetti and had enough to take home. My husband had the lamb shoulder and was happy as well--overall, all of the food is exceptional. Ordered a few bottles of wine, decided that dessert was out of the question as we were stuffed.

/user_details?userid=vnyCbur2BfmLKXFRkj2Rpw,Peter R.,"Austin, TX",2 star rating,"Okay, the food was all very delicious. Impeccably cooked and plated, however I must say that a dining experience is much more than just food. There were three major flaws with our evening, each worth a star in my opinion...1/ Our waiter. He did an extremely poor job of guiding us through the menu, seemingly satisfied with only recommending the most expensive items and bring them out to us in the quickest way possible. Since when is fine dining in Montréal meant to be a 'fast' food experience. He maybe spoke to us three times all night, and brought all of our dishes at once, without consideration of pace or pairing. 2/ The space. This was our second time to Joe Beef (we had an amazing meal last time we were here), but instead of being inside the restaurant we were placed outside in the shed. It was cold, bland and had all the ambiance of a Burger King. 3/ The music. The space might have been better if there wasn't dated, bad 90's tunes blaring above our heads. Maria Carey, seriously? I expect more for a restaurant that is supposedly one of the best in Montreal. Not worth the inconvenience not the money."
/user_details?userid=r9oIloZR3bfU7u6pesmNwQ,B B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I had a super fun experience here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SITTING AT THE BAR!!! Our server Henri was perfect and was there every step of the way. We loved talking to all the floating servers about food and wine. These peeps really are passionate. We trusted Henri to build our experience, he was definitely a joe beef expert, and he was shucking oysters for the guests while helping us. He did more than just explain to us what the dishes are, but helped build our menu. We didnt know if we would have the chance to come back so we tried to order almost the whole menu, but after having a conversation with Henri and choosing a wine to set the tone, my boyfriend and i agreed to do a customized tasting menu per Henri's suggestion. He had a talk with the chef and he ordered the dishes for us with a few off menu items. We let them surprise us the whole way and it was a perfect journey.It was very cool to see how connected the serve staff is with the food. One of the servers explained that he and Henri fermented their own hot sauce for the oysters. So special! Began with some oysters and a few light, bright, high contrast seafood dishes. Pretty much the opposite of what i expected to enjoy here. The flavor combinations were smart. There was a swordfish sashimi/crudo dressed in a really herb-y mignonette, almost too acidic but then finished magically with brown butter. Who would have even thought this would work? Another favorite was uni and bonito and daikon sort of tartare. Ive worked with sushi for many years, Uni and bonito in my brain shouldnt work... but this ended up being my favorite dish. Moved onto bone marrow and beef tartare(tip: with the leftover marrow drizzle it on your tartare-you wont regret it!!) the ingredients and components seemed classic and simple, which is refreshing in a world of overly trendy restaurants trying to put hipster spins on classical dishes.  Finished with papardelle, duck and duck hearts, and oxtail. The kitchen even sent us a salad to contrast with all the heaviness- hey, they worry about our health sort of! That small touch is true hospitality. We took some joe beef fries back to our hotel and yes we were gross and enjoyed them for breakfast the next day. Still bomb. They also do smaller portions of desserts if you have trouble deciding. Sometimes the best journey means letting someone else drive the car for you. Thank you Henri!!"
/user_details?userid=fsdMiWEz28WtOckoS1ANcw,Irving A.,"Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"Your experience here is highly dependent on how good your server is at explaining the menu.  You WILL need the menu explained to you, even if you speak French.The problem is the menu is written in chalk on a giant blackboard on one wall.  In the evening, this blackboard is hard to read - nearly every patron takes out their smartphone and snaps a picture.  In addition to the menu being written in French, the actual menu items are often rather very poor descriptions of the food you will get, and you will have no idea how big the portions are, which vary greatly and are in no way related to the price you will pay.So you stare at the menu, puzzle out what you might want.  Then you ask the server to explain it to you, and it's like having a waiter give you the specials.  Except this time there are 15 things to remember.  I watched two other couples on either side of me suffer through this process after I did.The food is excellent, provided you get what you expect.  I've included some pictures of what I ordered, paid, and the translation from French to English where needed.The only disappointment was the Lobster spagehtti.  It's quite expensive for what it is.  In comparison, the other items are a bargain, especially for an American with the current Canadian dollar exchange rate."

This place is in high demand and it can take months to get reservations here unless you know someone or get incredibly lucky from an opening and sliding in from the wait list. In my case, I booked my dining experience 3 months ahead and even the day the date I wanted, I was only given the option of the 9:15 PM seating.The incredible thing about this menu is that it's always changing and more than half the menu is different compared to what you read or look at pictures for. This is great in some ways and in other ways not so great if you want to try something you read or seen a picture of.We went with Oysters and a Mozzarella di Buffalo plate that came with a nutty chutney sauce for appetizers and they were great. The mignonette sauce that came with the Oysters was soooo great! The chutney sauce mixes so nicely with its nutty and warm taste vs the silky smooth fresh mozzarella. Both were big hits for us.For the main course we went with the plate for 2 Ribeye steak with side spaghetti squash and that plate knocked our socks off! That steak is baked to perfection and that squash made me re-think my opinion about squash. What. a. Plate!For dessert we went with their signaturelayered cake and ice cream sandwich and they were both misses for us. My Ice cream was sickly sweet.Service was great all night long, except for a late start. If my reservations are at 9:15... sitting down at 9:40 isn't an option. Don't allow that to happen. Our waiter was very good at his job and I marveled at his ability to remember the menu as well as he did.So the price-tag... yeah... this is a $$$$$ meal. Nothing I can't afford on special occasions but be mindful of that.."

The food was indeed spectacular for the most part. We had the steak monsieur, the duck fat fries, lobster spaghetti, scallop appetizer and two NB oysters to finish. I'm not sure if it's worth the hype or the price point. I loved the scallops - it was one of the best I've had but I was quite disappointed by the lobster spaghetti since I had high hopes for it. The steak was delicious but I think I prefer some other steakhouses in Montreal better judging from just the quality of the steak.  Overall, I wasn't blown away by the experience but I have nothing negative to say. It is good food and the service was decent."
/user_details?userid=CqE49Gu0rv4v2W41WbjOYQ,Maberry Y.,"Grafton, Canada",5 star rating,"TL;DR Excellent bistro fare in the heart of Montreal There are only three possible excuses for not coming to Joe Beef1. You are claustrophobic - tight hallways and crammed table lead to a lot of elbow bumping. 2. You are vegan - while there were some veggie friendly dishes on the menu, the vast majority of the stars of the menu were meats and fish. Also, there's a real hunted buffalo head in the washroom. 3. You don't like spending lots of money on food - there's nothing on this menu that is cheap. Oysters 5/5 - The bully oysters were outstanding - the most fresh, juicy, plump oysters we've ever tasted. The sauces - cocktail, mignonette, picked horseradish were all great and homemade. Their hot sauce was just good. Croquette 3/5 - Just your ordinary croquette. The smoked sturgeon was a nice touch, but if we ate this at a local buffet, we wouldn't be surprised. Escargot soup 5/5 - This is our first time having escargot. The Appalachian soup was smooth and creamy, while not being heavy. The escargot was slightly saltier and provided the perfect chew. The meat was tender and juicy. Fluke 5/5 - The fluke came basked in a cream sauce with fennel oil alongside a slice of caramelized fennel. The meat came tender, as it was barely cooked. We could tell it had been poached lightly given how well the flavour of the fish had been retained. The fennel provided a striking counterpoint to the fishes gentle flavour. Veal 4/5 - The veal was crisp, with a soft, fatty interior. The sauce was TO DIE for. So creamy, flavourful and just damn meaty. The turnips were also divine, and treated with the utmost respect. The only component of this dish that gave us pause was the offal. We aren't used to eating sweat breads and liver, so we were a little overwhelmed by the taste. It wasn't bad by any means - there was just a lot of it.Duck 5/5 - This was our favourite dish of the night, for many reasons. The potato wedges seemed like an afterthought, but they were literally the best chips we have had in our entire lives. They were crispy beyond belief, and super fluffy on the inside. Perfectly seasoned as well in their special sauce. The duck was also perfectly cooked. The crispy skin was covered in an orange sauce made from wine and foie gras. The liver gave the sauce an incredible body that really brought everything together. The only criticism of this dish was that our piece of duck had a line of tendon in it, making some pieces slightly chewier than the others. Overall: Excellent, hearty food. You should go out of your way to eat here, especially if you enjoy meat or seafood. Get the chips."

Started off with the $3.50 oysters, chebooktoosk from New Brunswick and point east from Prince Edward Island. They came with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and mignonette. Delicious. Then ordered the torchon de foie gras appetizer, which was served with apple, mustard seed, and dandelion greens. Very rich, but also very good. Tasted like fall on a plate.For dinner, had the roast beef, which was juicy, perfectly cooked and came with spinach and giant, crispy crunchy onion rings. Also the cod en croûte, which was served with potatoes and caviar in a colbert sauce. My oh my. In retrospect maybe I would have ordered a salad or something instead of the foie appetizer because everything we had was sooo rich, but that's my own fault. Not complaining! For dessert, the marjolaine cake. This is a MUST order. Out of this world. We mentioned when we sat down that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday, and they even bought it out with a sparkler candle. Very cute. Also, the servers here are very versed in wines and spirits. Feel free to let them take the reigns!I have to say, our server was PHENOMENAL. Informative, never rushed us, was friendly, paced our meal out perfectly - he was just great. He asked us what our likes and dislikes are, and helped us pick out what to order. Don't be scared if you don't speak French!However, if I could I would knock off half a point because there was an altercation at the table next to us (different server). The problem is that the tables here are sooo very close together, that we felt like we got trapped in the middle of this table's argument. If you have a table for 2, you are basically sitting on top of your neighbors. So, at one point, the couple sitting to one side of us misordered something. Side note, I will say was of no fault of the restaurant - I actually heard them order it - and (since the tables are so close together) I remember thinking to myself, 'I wonder how they will like it' because it was the same appetizer we had ordered. However, when it came out I guess it wasn't what they meant to order (there were multiple appetizers with foie), probably an honest mistake. But when they tried to send it back the waiter became VERY argumentative with them. I completely understand the waiter's frustration here, but he needed to handle it better. Yes this couple was also getting argumentative, and I'm pretty sure the order was right unless I also misheard it, but he was the one in the professional roll here. He was standing basically on top of our table while arguing with them for five minutes with voices being raised, and it was very uncomfortable and kind of a mood killer."

I've been waiting 10 years to eat here. I'm a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain (RIP) and after watching his relationship with the chef brothers who own this place grow on television all these many years and seasons, how could anyone not want to eat here? Ok so the menu board is written in French. So what. Learn French, you're in Montreal. Or have the wonderful waitress we had, who was so friendly and so cool, and who broke everything down. But it didn't matter because this was our one shot to order correctly so I just told her to take the wheel and she ordered so much of the food for us. And she nailed it. My only regret, we never got her name so we could properly thank her for her ever so perfect service. Here it goes. So my wife who isn't easily impressed by food, not because she's a snob but because she isn't a ""foodie"" (god I hate that word). When she took her first bite into those sea snails and I watched her eyes roll back into her head, I knew we hit pay dirt. She looked at me like she finally understood the meaning to life.Then we had the sweetbreads, another first for her, and we both were like what in the actual f... are we eating? How could food possibly be this good? Time for the main course. Cheval au Poivre, translation: Horse. Yup, Horse. When amI ever going to get to eat Horse again? So look. It's delicious. Only slightly game-y. Whatever cut we had was super tender. That bone marrow was heavenly. The fried duck egg on top help lend a little extra fat to the dish. What can I say, I like Horse now.Ok but that Beer Can Cauliflower, when I say this was the most delicious bite of food on the whole menu, it really was. I'm just going to leave that there. Order it. Thank you mystery waitress lady.My wife who would eat French fries her whole life for breakfast, lunch, and dinner told me without a doubt those were the best damn French Fries she has literally ever had in her whole damn life. I'm not much for dessert, but when at Joe Beef, you try to eat everything until you're about to explode. So I got the French Crueller with strawberries. And it was perfect. Simply that. Perfect.So that's all folks. Thanks for indulging. Sorry for the novel. I hope I eat here again. And if I do, I will be ever so grateful for the opportunity."

Sharing plates gave our party of four the opportunity to sample entrées: foie gras (silky smooth and so much taste!), papardelle lapin, stuffed zucchini flowers (OMG!) and tartare (delicate); mains: rabbit (best I've tasted EVER), fish (cooked to perfection), beef and lamb. I'm not a big fan of desserts but loved the custarde aux prunes and everybody else also enjoyed the layer cake. Quick mention about the service. Our waiter was immensely knowledgeable and really helpful in guiding us through the complex blackboard menus. Assisted us with matching wines. And it seems like all the service staff knew what we were having and worked together as a team. Assisted so much with our enjoyment. This place isn't cheap and our booking was for 9.45pm, finishing around midnight, but it is an investment in time and money that is more than worthwhile. Make Joe Beef your 'must go to' place when visiting Montreal. Book well in advance, book to eat late, grovel at the door to get in. Just go there!"

Super knowledgeable, great personality, super attentive. The menu was hard to read so we basically let David recommend dishes for us. We started out with smoked meat croquettes and a meat/mackerel spread on toast. It was all just great. For dinner, I ordered the roast duck with fois gras. It exceeded all expectations (which were very high) cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The roasted apples and potatoes were a nice touch. Hands down the best thing I ate in Montréal. My boyfriend had a steak (can't remember which) and French fries. All great! Steak was medium rare to rare which was wonderful. We ordered a delicious peach sorbet with shortbread for dessert which was fabulous. Overall, the best dining experience. Be sure to book reservations MONTHS in advance-it's worth it! No complaints whatsoever."

My friend and I loved every bite of our desserts, practically wanting to lick the bowl clean (not terribly chic but we tried).  If you can get in, you must take your time and enjoy this place.  The perfect beginning to our awesome weekend.  Merci beaucoup!"

Our reservation was late, i think 9pm or 9:30, and we arrived on time but still had to wait a while. They apologized and sent us to the bar which was a bit tight to wait at. I thought they were giving us a drink to compensate for the wait time but in the end we paid for them. It definitely got better from here though!The food was excellent. Between the two of us we shared a horse steak with an egg on top, smoked lamb shoulder with kale and lentils, venison tartare, foie gras and mashed potatoes with cheese curds. I had never had horse steak before, and although it was just a bit unevenly cooked it was mostly great. The lamb dish was borrowing flavors from southern American bbq (where I'm from) and it did it well.  And you can't go wrong with tartare, foie gras or cheesy mashed potatoes.  I know the lobster spaghetti is one of their most famous dishes, but there were too many interesting things on the menu. If I go back I would like to try it. The server was nice and helpful and although it's an upscale restaurant the ambiance is pretty casual and dark."

I've been wanting to come, and finally snagged a spot (albeit at 9:30pm, but I didn't mind...I'll eat good food at any time of the day/night)! Their menu is on a large chalkboard, but luckily, I was seated right below it so it was easy to ruminate over what I wanted to pick. You can take a picture for ease of reference too. Service was really good; the waitresses were very nice and genuinely interested in whether the customer liked the dish or not. Mine checked up frequently, which was a nice touch. I asked mine what her favourite dishes were, and she was very persuasive! I tried 3 main plates and a beer (none of the appetizers seemed that amazing to me, haha). The chalkboard only had white and red wines (by the bottle) listed, so you have to ask the waitress for cocktails. Not sure if you can get the wines by the glass? It seemed to be only by the bottle. - Lobster spaghetti $38: a must-have. The spaghetti was still a bit firm, so it had a lot of bite. The sauce is RICH but also light; it tasted very seafood-ey and I asked for bread to soak it up (they don't automatically give you bread). There were 3 pieces of lobster which were tender and delicious. A nice light indulgence! - Smoked lamb shoulder with beets $37: WOW, super tender!!! There were 2 large pieces, beets, and some greens. The smokiness really added to the flavour of the lamb. - Horse tournedos $40: I've never tried horse before, so this was a must order for me, as I LOVE to try unique/rare/limited dishes. The horse itself was light-tasting, but still meaty. Although it didn't look huge, the portion was hearty since it's like eating a dense steak! The thick, rich, orangey sauce was savoury and with each bite I tried to get as much of it as possible onto the meat. I would say this is a must order, and I preferred it over the lamb! In general, the dishes were all made really well, although the presentation could be improved. It would also help if more details of the menu could be provided, such as a listing of the ingredients in each dish; on the chalkboard, only the major components of each dish are listed. The table next to me ordered the seafood platter, and were praising how fresh and delicious it was. I'll probably try that next time! I was too full for dessert, so that will also be for the next time. The atmosphere is quite dark but cozy, although it can get quite loud; I had to speak loudly to be heard, but it's definitely a lively environment!"

We ended ordering 3 appetizers- the sea urchin with the jalapeño aioli, Headcheese croquettes and the Scottish egg wrapped in smoked eel.  All the appetizers were good. For our main dishes we ordered the famous Lobster spaghetti, the sweetbreads with a side of foie gras and fries. The lobster spaghetti was ""ordinary"" IMO, nothing special about it and the sweetbreads had no flavor.  I was disappointed with both main courses.  Overall, Joe Beef is a great place to gather with good friends, have drinks and to share plates.  Reservations are highly recommended - be prepared for a wait and not much elbow space."

There is massive wine by the bottle list on a chalkboard in the main dining room; by the glass isn't as extensive but has numerous choices.  Our waitress was friendly and enthusiastic and let us take our time in ordering and eating.  The menu is vast and written in French on the chalkboard.  Our waitress didn't go through each and every item, but asked us what we were in the mood for and our likes and then highlighted many of the items; maybe not completely optimal, but I didn't think we missed out on anything.Starters included the stuffed fried zucchini blossoms which were stuffed with smoked meat, sauerkraut and cheese; they were lightly battered and fried and were excellent.  Light even though the majority of ingredients were anything but.  Next up was veal tongue with tomatoes and shaved black truffles. I've had tongue before and it is normally sliced thin or chopped up; not this version.  It was served whole; yep just like a tongue looks.  Honestly I was a little taken back, but once I got past it and dug in I realized how good it was.  At this point (about 8pm) things seemed to have quieted down and tables emptied out; that didn't last long, that was the lull in between the early and late crowd.  Within minutes all seats were once again occupied; I can't imagine you can get in without a reservation.On to entrees we wanted the signature lobster spaghetti and another dish so our waitress suggested ordering a half portion of the spaghetti which was a great call.  The Lobster spaghetti was decadent and divine.  It was so creamy and satisfying that I wanted to keep eating it and almost wished we had a full order (which would have totally been a mistake).  We also got the chicken which was half a chicken that was roasted served along with clams and calamari; seemed like an odd combo, but it worked so well together.  The seafood was tender and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  It was a sensational dish.For dessert we opt'd for the hazelnut layer cake which was light and not too sweet; it was a perfect ending.  Joe Beef lived up to the hype and I am so happy I was able to experience it."

So there is a way to bypass the website for 1-2 ppl.It was an easy walk from the Lionel Groulx metro. I got there at around 5:50 pm - and it was freezing, there was quite a few people waiting outside -the doors strictly opened at 6 pm after what seemed to be a team huddle inside. The venue was nice - real cozy, dim lighting with Christmas lights, authentic decor - seafood house vs hunting club? (including hanging trout vs stag head). It was cool to see pictures of ""joe beef"".The menu changes daily that could explain the crammed up bad hand writing on a chalk board that you could barely make out in low lighting. Even with a snapped picture -everything is written in French with no space for item descriptions. It's kind of overwhelming-so your only bet is your server explaining the menu, why not get printed menus?My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers: 2 entrées, dessert and a cup of tea totaling to 66$ per person. All items were enough to share for 2 ppl- Amazing deal for that much food! The wine selection was quite vast and can easily add up the bill!Rating on 5 stars: I don't have exact names of items from memory , so I may be off with some ingredients) all these dishes were good to share for 2 ppl.Appetizers: prices around 15$-17$ per item-venison tartar ***(comes served inside a lightly toasted piece of bread topped with an egg. The tartar was well seasoned, not too gamey, with the broken egg that complimented it so well); goat cheese croquette? ****(absolutely loved this dish, that came as a ball of finely cut potatoe strips/topped with a baked goat cheese, in a light butter-like sauce) Entrees: prices start around 20$ and up..pork chop ***(came with a side of mushrooms with a hint of cilantro. The pork chop was really tender but there was a lot of fat); famous lobster spaghetti ****(what seemed like 1/2 lobster in a reach butter cream sauce, pretty heavy - good to have as a main course on its own)Dessert: was frankly disappointing- but I get it , this is not suppose to be its forté! We had a flakey pastry crust filled with chocolate mousse, whip cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Pass on dessert for a glass of their fine wine.I ended my hearty meal with a cup of warm chai tea.

Followed with a wonderful corn soup with clams ... absolutely amazing and firmly in line with serving fresh ingredients. Terrific and mind blowing good. Went for signature dish of lobster and pasta which is renown. Let's say it was delicious which it was. Unfortunately, I had remorse watching others have duck, rabbit, steak... and bone marrow and other dishes which is my fault for not going in the direction of meat. Pasta is great and I loved my dish but I felt like I didn't get the real experience. Finished with a superb peach dessert that was truly mouth savering with each bite. Since dishes change all the time (I was hoping to try the beer can cauliflower or pea soup or salami plate) and the menu is in French only...one is left to the staff to guide decisions and most people have had great experiences, I loved the meal but wish I could read it online first in advance or had a staff member explain it in detail better.

Our waiter/bartender had a few special features for the night, but customization is also possible. All you have to do is tell them what flavours you like and they will whip something up.- Order the lobster spaghetti, you will not regret it. This is the only dish that stays on the menu, as the rest are driven by ingredients that are in season.- Dessert portions were very generous, reasonably priced, and oh so delicious!Not a fan of:- It's very difficult to get a reservation at Joe Beef, but I was lucky since they had 2 spots at the bar table during the time I was in Montreal. The bar seats may feel a bit too cozy, but I didn't mind it too much. I would suggest to call for a reservation rather than booking online. You'll never be able to get seats unless you go on their website 2 months in advance.As part of our foodie trip in Montreal, Joe Beef was definitely on the top of our list. And it did not disappoint. Once we stepped foot into the restaurant, the magic began. Service was top notch, without feeling too stuffy. We were greeted with a smile by every staff member we walked past. Our waiter/bartender was chatty, fun and extremely welcoming. My husband ordered one of the featured drinks for the night with gin, fresh lemon juice and a fanta soda. I requested for a drink with ginger, and he immediately offered me something that resembled a Moscow mule, but instead of ginger beer, fresh ginger juice was used. Each of the cocktails were $15 and they were absolutely worth it. We ordered the following:- Fish Croquettes with caviar ($8) - The original appetizer came with 4 pieces, but they halved the serving for us so that we could try more food. The croquettes had a crunchy exterior and the next layer melted in our mouths. Generally, we enjoyed the flavours of these fried rolls, although they were a bit salty for our taste.- Beef Tartare ($16) -  Again, we found this dish on the salty side, as we noticed a lot of capers in the mixture. However, we didn't mind it too much as the beef tartare had a great texture. The meat wasn't mushy, there was still a slight bounce to it and you can really taste the beefy flavours. The chips served could have been more crispy, but overall, this was still a very solid dish. - Bone marrow endive salad ($18) - The bone marrow was just seasoned with salt and pepper and it resembled the richness of soft butter. The endive salad was extremely fresh with a light sweetness that was balanced by a slightly acidic dressing. The capers brought out the savory flavours and the addition of the chervil herbs made it bright and refreshing. We mixed in the mildly sweet and nutty marrow into the salad and it was an amazing combination of rich and refreshing, all at the same time.- Lobster Pasta ($38) - There is a reason why this is the only dish that consistently stays on the menu. This is one of the most delicious pastas we have had. The lobster bisque cream sauce is genius, sweet, creamy, and infused with a ton of lobster flavour. On top of that, the sweetness of the sauce was balanced with punches of savoury flavours from the small chunks of fried bacon. The lobster was cooked to perfection, and of course the pasta was al dente. We almost ordered another one, but refrained as we wanted room for desserts. - Hazelnut layered cake ($11) - This is a popular dessert item and my husband was very pleased. The chocolate ganache was rich and not too sweet with the addition of the creme fraiche and the cake was extremely moist.  - Panna cotta with black grapes ($11) - The panna cotta was really creamy and rich, absolutely decadent. I loved the addition of the fresh ricotta cheese and it complimented perfectly with the sweet black grapes on top.Although there were some small misses with the dishes, it was still a 5 star experience overall. We are extremely pleased with the restaurant's dedication to delivering a complete dining experience from the moment we walked in. I can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=-7ytA0JLbkhXcCTyf-oceA,Oliver V.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",5 star rating,"Joe Beef's reputation is as thick and rich as the butter they use in their famous lobster pasta. But at the end of the day, you are still tempted to take a bite. It's a special place with many accolades but it is by no means a luxury fine dining experience. Aside from the price-point, this place is ultra-casual, fun and noisy, meant to be enjoyed with a lively group and not the stuffy, pretentious types. It looks small, but there are three different rooms that accommodated plenty of people. Nevertheless, you still need a reservation because it fills up quickly. Also, since the menu is only written in 8pt sans serif on a dimly lit chalk board 100 feet away, you can't pick a meal in the traditional way...so I took the advice of previous reviewers and just let our server (Laura) craft our meal based on what we like to eat and how hungry we were. And to be honest, she nailed it. So, our experience was phenomenal. The food came out in quick but not hurried manner and Laura was even able to recommend a wine in the same way a sommelier would at a fancy-pants restaurant. I'd say that if you are hesitant about what you can/can't eat, or you are not jiving with your server, you may not like it (especially after you get the bill). But it's fun to through caution into the wind once in a while...and they serve fresh fish, meat and produce. So it's not that complicated. And life shouldn't be."

The steak though cooked perfectly was fatty . For the price we paid for two entrees and 4 drinks I don't think it was worth the price .

I ate at the bar counter, it was only seat on that side of the counter, so enough room. First I had the beef tartar with bone marrow. The egg comes inside a jelly, once mixed everything was delicious. I tried next the spaghetti with lobster and bacon (one of the few dishes that are always on the menu). It is a must, the lobster is extremely juicy and the whole dish is delicious. For dessert I tried a kind of cronut with chocolate mousse inside and chestnut on top, was good but not excellent.Was funny to find a Kölsch variety of beer here, although it didn't taste at all like the real one (which for many can be a good thing :-)) I also had an amazing Bloody Caesars (should have ordered it as an appetizer though) and a customized rum based cocktail which was outstanding.The service is excellent, prompt to provide guidance on the extensive changing menu written on a chalkboard in French, just trust them. I also was lucky to have a couple of charming patrons sitting next to me, which also made the evening remarkable.On what regards to the price, it is expensive, but considering the quality of the food and the service I would recommend it."
/user_details?userid=IzJ36jX6V6ky5BtoN-Agng,Chun P.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"I love Anthony Bourdain, and one of his TV shows featured Joe Beef. Its a very popular restaurant and you gotta book this place months in advance, so I was really excited when I got a last minute same day reservation...but unfortunately I only liked this place, I didn't love it...its definitely overrated and a victim of its own success. 3.5 Stars.The rustic space is hipster casual and packed with a few too many tables crammed in, and definitely not romantic. At all. That's okay, I'm cool with that, I know its more about the food here than ambiance, but the diners to the left and right of us were way too close. The waitress's and busboy's butts were both very nice, but their derriers nearly knocked over wine glasses since the tables are so crammed together. Their butts are literally resting on your table as they deliver and remove plates from your table or your neighbors' table. Following on that, its loud in here. Really loud. Between all the voices and the music it was hard to talk with my lovely wife(This might be a good thing if your relationship is on the fritz). Besides their nice butts, the waitress and busboy were both super friendly...but overworked. These two, and the bartender, were trying to cover 7 tables and 8 bar stools that were rarely empty. The poor couple next to us were ignored for at least 20 minutes(we tried to keep them some company). The food comes out relatively fast, but the wait staff just can't keep up with the kitchen staff. Expect a 2+ hour dining experience, and don't plan on catching a show or movie afterwards. Joe Beef was gonna be the big splurge of my 8 night Canadian vacation. But the cheapest wine bottle was $45, which is a bit high for a hipstery casual venue. Whatever, the waitress hooked us with a nice bottle of white since they were out of the $45 and $50 options, but still only charged us $50. Only $50...$3.50 Oysters...fresh and delicious! We only ordered 3, but they still gave us all the extras. $14 Lobster meatball pastry...awesome! Or I thought at least, the wife was not impressed with the lobster meatball, but I liked it. We both loved the creamy lobster sauce, and ordered extra bread($2.5 btw) to soak up and chomp on that deliciousness. $35 Lobster Spaghetti...my pick, and I found it very good, and a good value! The lobster cream sauce was rich and light at the same time, somehow, and worked well with the al dente spaghetti and generous lobster portions. At $26 in American dollars this was a great value in that sense. $41 Seabass...not so impressive. It was generous piece of seabass, but lacked flavor and the tomato based sauce was bland...maybe they were counting on freshness to pull the dish through? Nope. Sad Wife = Sad Life. Don't order this.$11 15 layer cake. Or is it 11 layers? 13? I don't know, but this was pretty good overall, though too thin and dry for my tastes. Its a mix of vanilla, chocolate, and I think hazelnut. It was around 10:15pm, so maybe it had been sitting out a bit too long. It probably tasted better at 8:00pm. With taxes and tip, the final bill came out to just over $200+ Canadian dollars. My wife was relieved that this was more like $160ish in American dollars, thank gawd! Due to the overworked staff, it took us 20 some minutes just to get and pay the bill. Do I regret eating at Joe Beef? No, but I was disappointed and not sure if I will bother coming back...maybe...and maybe we should've ordered one beef entree in place called ""Joe Beef"".  Maybe."

/user_details?userid=TzYxxd2g8JwXbBdKmhWtBw,Mark S.,"Aventura, FL",5 star rating,"4.5: I'd rate this just a hair under sister restaurant Liverpool House (which is much easier to get into).  As mentioned in my review of that other restaurant, we had back-to-back meals at both restaurants on a cold and snowy April (!) evening.  Our excellent meal began with a disappointment when I ran my eyes across the expansive chalkboard menu: ""where's the foie""?  At Liverpool the night before there were several options, but I'd ""saved"" myself to really go wild at J.B., and it seemed I was going to be disappointed.  Thankfully there was an eclair appetizer ($21 - top right of my picture) that was perhaps my ""best bite of Montreal"" - just insanely rich and delicious, and something I'd never dream of not sharing (need at least one other person to share with).  More appetizers: Our beef tartare was so good the night before that we went with that again here, and again it was fantastic, here served on toast.  The croquettes (which seem to always be available, with the protein changing nightly) were cod on this night, and very enjoyable with the bbq, mustard and tartare sauces (wish I'd tried the rabbit ones at Liverpool House).  There was also a green Pappardelle pasta with ragu ($16: middle left) that was very tasty, but more of a side dish than an app.As we had done the night before, the focus was on the creative apps, with 2 main courses to share.  The first was the ""Pojarski de boeuf"" ($30: middle right) which was a giant meatball served with more delicious pappardelle.  We also had the ""tranche d'epaule d'agneau Boulangere"" ($35, bottom left) which was an amazing braised lamb shoulder.  We shared these with 2 veg plates: the cauliflower gratin (delicious, but so cheesy as to negate calling it a ""vegetable dish"") and another dish of bitter greens that was left pretty untouched (like Liverpool House, the veg options were hit and miss, with one being great, and one disappointing, at each restaurant).Our group of 4 was again full, but determined to have dessert.  The multi-layer hazelnut cake and the paris brest chocolate concoction were both stupendous, but the sticky toffee from next door still edged them out.Joe Beef was superior to Liverpool in the pacing of the meal: apps came one at a time to be fully enjoyed, not all at once (but this may have been due to our arrival at 6pm opening).  But after our first dessert, service deteriorated when there was an achingly long pause until the second dessert, and an even longer one for the bill, both of which ended the experience on an avoidable low note."

Coupled with the best service with that meal, provides and unforgettable experience.Had no clue that were ever going here, and quite honestly haven't heard of this place. My buddy got the recommendation and we just walked from our hotel following him to the restaurant not knowing where we were going. In fact, I don't even think we had a reservation, but I upon arrival, the stars aligned and they said they will squeeze us in.They quoted about a 25 minute wait, so we awaited in the front for about 5-10 minutes then told us to come in and wait in their patio for another 10-15. That was fine as we started off with a bottle of wine.  After that, everything went by quick. Our server, Isabella(?) was stellar. We wanted to try everything so she asked if we line exotic stuff like horse meat, or ""regular"" stuff like their beef dishes and corn.  She then proceeded to make her own tasting menu based on what we told her we liked.All her choices were mind blowing! Since this review is already long, I'll try and make it shorter since I got overly excited about writing about this place.  I can't remember all the names of the dishes and what was in them, but at least I have the pictures! Started with the salami plate and the just kept getting blown away. Even one of their simple dishes such as the corn was heavenly, but their grass fed steak was my favorite dish. Better than some of my favorite steakhouses here in la. Also, their lobster spaghetti is a must try as well!!  Service was so good, a lot of the staff came in to check on us...then next thing we know, we were all sharing a few drinks with everyone! Awesome.  Even the chef came out to greet us. We felt like vips for sure.  There's more to write about other dishes we had, and even our crazy 4 dish dessert, but I'll leave it here and you can check out the pictures."

The food hit every mark. Everything was fabulous. The service was spectacular as well, and really put this place over the edge into true brilliance. As others have noted, there's no menus, only a blackboard with all the offerings of the night. But our server walked right up to us, sat on the bench next to me and said 'what would you like to eat tonight?' Making it clear that they were here for us, to make our night perfect. We answered that we didn't like making decisions, that we aren't picky, and really want to experience this place as it's supposed to be experienced. She was ecstatic and brought us several courses with different beverage pairings. The whole meal was custom-made. A raw seafood platter, a plate of raw root vegetables with lobster and a zucchini flour croquette filled with smoked eel (the dish of the night), quail with sour cherries, porchetta, and a berry dessert concoction with a meringue (now one of my all time favorite desserts I've had). Spectacular from start to finish. All dishes I wouldn't have thought to order. That's why I don't like to choose. Trust them. For two people, including beverage pairings, food, tax, and tip, the meal was about $336. A frakkin' steal, if you ask me. A lot of people just order the lobster spaghetti. As such, it's always on the menu. You don't come to a place like this to order that. I'm sure it's good, but it's the indulgent meal you expect. Try something new."

We heard a lot of great things about the food, how it's the best in the area etc. my husband and I showed up dress for an upscale night out. (As we do not get out much without our children)First, this isn't a fancy place, there are no physical menus. This is More like your local corner breakfast cafe with a dinner menu written on a chalk board in French. So if you didn't catch what the waitress said dinner was for the night and you can't read French your out of luck.Second, I couldn't even eat there with how filthy the place was. Then, to make it worse, we were refused a glass of wine because we weren't going to eat there. And then almost made feel like we were spoiled Americans because we wanted to eat in a more upscale atmosphere. One woman proceeded to tell us that we would be pleasantly surprised that the place is a wolf in sheep's clothing. If you need to describe your establishment like that then I think it's time to make some modifications."
/user_details?userid=AwxrZB_vPc5SI6ascS8UfQ,Jessica H.,"Sarnia, Canada",2 star rating,"I'll start off with one major positive - they did save our table as we had trouble getting there due to deadlocked traffic from a massive protest that congested the streets.  However, overall:  Not impressed, I do not think it deserves to be ranked above Toque! Or Montreal Plaza on Canada's best restaurants list.  First off, the waiter was just not that friendly.  He didn't even tell us the menu is on a chalkboard on the wall (in the dark by the way) until I looked at him blankly as he was going through menu items, he was sort of unimpressed with my husband on his phone but we weren't realizing he was going to go through the whole menu himself, the waiter just said ""I'll come back"" and walked off but i was staring right at him asking questions, so what if my husband wasn't understanding everything going on, i was going to do all the ordering for us anyways...by the way the board was not visible from where we are sitting, so i had to rely on his explanations and i like to really peruse a menu before choosing, so that's a negative.  He said the reason is they change menus daily - If you are going to change menus daily that's great, invest in some iPads then or place boards on either sides of the walls so everyone can see.  Service was slow (but we know they are very busy so that's ok) however the tables are so close together the people next to us kept staring at us, smiling strangely at us, it was odd to say the least.  Restaurants are about way more than just food - it's about an experience and ambiance...Joe Beef's vibe was more of a bro's night out vibe and even then it will be an uncomfortable night out with odd seating, hot temperatures and no visible menus  (oh and it was our anniversary trip and nobody acknowledged it whereas every other restaurant did). Now for the food - lobster spaghetti was definitely very  good - it is a must have, however the steak...when you come to Joe BEEF you think the steak is the star.  It was soooo underwhelming.  Granted, i had to order it well done because of being pregnant (they actually undercooked it at first and i had to send it back) but i I've had delicious well done steak before and this was just not anything special...Dare I say that The Keg has better steaks?  And at $60 for said steak, you would expect much better.  The sides of haricot, mais and frites were delicious but I don't think they are ""2nd best restaurant in Canada"" worthy.  Overall I think this place is more hype than anything.  We won't be returning...there are much better places to eat in Montreal with more space, a more imaginative menu and better service.  Toqué!, Plaza, Damas and Bar George were much better experiences for us."

The highlight was the eggplant with lamb dish. It was excellent. The rabbit terrine was delicious as well. The salami with fennel was very good. The veal ham was unique (veal in the style of ham) and quite good. The mains were great. The sweetbreads were excellent and a massive portion. The quail was rich and very good.

/user_details?userid=bBQZxbAr331bA2Lqqvt5dw,Saul G.,"White Plains, NY",5 star rating,"TLDR: Book early and yes, it's the real deal.A 5:30 reservation on a Tuesday, the only slot available during our stay in Montreal. I had made the booking weeks in advance, before choosing a hotel.Ubers being hard to find, we arrived late and the hosts were cool about it. Wound up with a good, if cozy, table near the bar. Our server, a formidable femme Normande named Laura, was quite pleasant. She suggested three starters and one entree for the two of us. Instead, I went with four starters and two entrees - our appetites being large.The night's offerings are displayed on a chalkboard that you visit with your server. I plumped for the silvertail, foie gras, soft shell crab and the marrow bone, realizing I was likely forfeiting a sweet.The soft shell crab was crisped perfectly and topped with a salad of small greens - probably mache. The silvertail came as a sort of ceviche. Of course the foie gras was superb. The simple marrow bone had been split lengthwise, which seems to be the custom these days instead of  across, as at St. John. I thought that the portion - one six inch bone, was small for the price.For main courses we had the aged magret of duck, and sweetbreads with girolles. I'd give the nod to the luscious sweetbreads, the duck was a bit chewy even though it was properly cooked.Our wines were by the glass, the best being a glass of Beaujolais recommended by Laura. No room for dessert. At Laura's suggestion, had a trou normand instead. Walked the long way home....Worthy of its reputation and the price."

It maybe my favorite restaurant, period.The execution of incredible quality with incredible skills, and amazing service (that borders on white glove), while maintaining a casual air (quite a few patrons in t-shirt and jeans), maybe one of my favorite things about it.Always the little things.... like finding the last bottle of that Gevrey-Chambertin I love so much... or going out of the way to get the name of that local cheese on the cheese plate that knocked my socks off.... everything.I've had two bachelor party dinners here (one with some young 20-somethings that I thought would surely be bored). After we walked out, one of the 20-something dudes said ""can I hug you now? that maybe the best meal I ever had!""And then on my next trip, I brought a girl, and had a romantic table for two in the middle of the back garden... completely to ourselves. She pretty much said the same exact thing after her meal.  HAHASo far, I've sat in the front room, at the bar, and in the back garden... I'd say I'm a bigger fan of the latter two.As per food, if it's your first time, don't miss the Lobster Pasta... once you've had it - try everything else.[*** New Addition 6/24/17: The Pasta with Sea Urchin is the best pasta I've ever had... it should be on the regular menu.

/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  Joe Beef accepts credit cards."
/user_details?userid=CtgTtg3JXpkma0XP6xqkvg,Peter N.,"Lafayette, LA",3 star rating,"While planning the bachelor trip, we wanted a nice place to try out while in Montreal.  I researched and found this place.  I heard that you need to reserve months in advance.  We luckily got a table.. well two tables.  When booking, there won't be anything open for more than 6 people.. we booked two 6 people reservations, and requested to sit together if possible.. unfortunately we could not sit next to each other.  When we arrived, we still had to wait past our reservations, which we did not mind much.. but how their attitude was toward us, was unforgettable.  They gave us this demeanor as if they were too good for us.. as if they did not want to serve us.  I hated that the menu was on chalk board only.. and in French only.. I did not mind that it is French only, but its kind of hard to look at the menu in the dark, and in the corner of the building where the menu is out of sight.  We wanted to try some horse ribeye and foie gras double down, both which was not available when was there, so we just asked the waitress to suggest some stuff for us.. we had the following:- Oysters - fresh, sweet and salty- Horse tartar - just wanted to try some horse, was okay- Duck fat fries - delicious and crispy- Bone marrow - rich and flavorful- Blood tart - I did not care for this much, a little too bitter for my liking- Lobster spaghetti - the lobster was cooked perfectly, the sauce was okay- Duck - cooked perfectly, pack with flavor - Beef - also cooked perfectly, deliciousOverall, the food options were great, just very crappy service.  We probably would not come back."

Very similar menu. Substantially lower price. Less need to reserve in advance. So at this point, I don't see the need to go to Joe Beef (despite its fame) and simply go to Liverpool House (which is really good!). I may be missing something here though.One general word of caution: Don't go to Joe Beef (or Liverpool House) if you don't like heavy food. This can be said about several other notable places in Montreal (e.g., Au Pied de Cochon)."

Keep in mind that you will probably need to make reservations several weeks and possibly months in advance depending on when you want to eat there. The  atmosphere was warm and inviting, the dining area was actually bigger than it looked, and there is also an outdoor patio area. Overall, the food we ordered was mind-blowingly delicious. All the flavors were very well balanced and seasoned nicely. Food here is on the heavier side and very rich because the dishes are mostly meat based. Our server was excellent, very informative, and attentive to our needs. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience in Montreal, this place far exceeded my expectations. I would be thrilled to return if given the chance."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Too many superlatives about Joe Beef, but I can't necessarily second them. The ambiance is great, the vibe is noisy and relaxed, the packed restaurant certainly has a charm. Trying to figure out the menu on the black board and follow the detailed explanations of our hostess was a little challenging when you are trying to pick a dish, but definitely part of the fun. I absolutely enjoyed the BC oysters and the clams in lobster broth that came with a slice of the delicious garlic bread. The Bloody Caesar is to die for, may be one of the best in Montreal. The escargot de Bourgogne were great, but not exceptional. The salad with endives and pear was ginormous and obviously delicious, vegetarians, you are safe in this meaty heaven. Three of us shared hare for main, one loved it, two didn't like it very much. I personally found it over salted, fortunately it came with a side of mashed potato and foie gras that compensated for it. The rest of our party were happy with their mains: the famous spaghetti lobster and cold roast beef. I guess the sweet highlight for majority of our crowd was the ice cream with pear, hot chocolate poured generously over it.  The hazelnut cake is classical and masterfully prepared. My dessert was disappointment and I would not write about it. What I failed to enjoy was our little check drama. The service in the restaurant is great, friendly and smiling. Our hostess was knowledgeable, her dish descriptions were a little bit pretentious, but we found it charming and really part of the overall experience. Than she brought the one single check we had to kindly ask to split (something normal for Montreal) and we got lectured that we should have preventively provided information at the beginning of the dinner how to divide the bill. We got our billS as requested, but some further comments were not with the understanding that ""the customer is always right"". The result is half a star less for the restaurant and standard tip.My final rating for Joe Beef is 3.5 stars. Would I come back, definitely yes, there is so much more to explore from the menu!"

The restaurant is CRAMPED! There is potential for your neighbors to be involved in your table conversation if they wanted to be. Started with the lobster spaghetti which was a-mazing! The roast beef was a bit ham-y and wished we got the ny strip instead. There were hardly any veggies so I felt like the meal was really rich. As the ""veg"" option, we got radishes which were soaked in a cream foie gras sauce. Everything was great but just a bit too rich for me but it was still great. The waitress was great too. Might come with more people and hope to avoid nosy table neighbors."
/user_details?userid=mEeHtdreEMT8iiU-B7_vAA,Mike G.,"Port Jefferson, NY",5 star rating,"Last Saturday I had the opportunity to go to Joe Beef by securing a reservation 2 months in advance on my night shift at 3am. I traveled from New York for this. I was not disappointed. I'm a huge fan of the style of this restaurant.  French cooking with no pretense, large portions, quality, fresh, interesting ingredients, outstanding service, cool eclectic atmosphere. If I ever opened some type of food establishment, it would be inspired by Joe Beef. I had the smoked meat croquettes, white asparagus with ham and what I believe they called white oyster sauce, frites joe beef (fries), a platter of duck with duck breast, duck heart sausage, and duck foie gras on top of gravy with strawberries, the lobster spaghetti, and the layer cake for desert. Everything was outstandingly delicious. The lobster spaghetti was probably the least interesting thing we had, but since it's a Joe Beef classic I recommend trying it at least the first time you go. The waitress also helped us make our decisions, and was highly personable. Highly, highly recommend checking this place out if you can get a reservation.  Next time I'll check out one of their other restaurants in the area. Montreal is also a wonderful place in itself."

/user_details?userid=TU8NsFvjzLqkI87QQqkJPw,Stephanie T.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"So I stalked this restaurant for months before my visit to Montreal, having been told it as a must try while in town.At the two month mark they were already fully booked for the two days I was planning to be in town. Devastating!Determined to eat there, I called back daily to ask if anything had opened up. After about two weeks of this the staff kindly informed me that my best bet was to wait until day-of. So come last week during my trip, I started calling as soon as the reservations line opened. Heartbreakingly - no cancellations and according to the reservationist, no openings at their reservation only location. Did I give up at this point? No way!Showed up at the restaurant about twenty minutes before it's 6pm opening. They were still having a staff meeting. Whoops. Around 5:55 those with actual reservations began lining up and when they came to start seating them - the hostess found us a solution right away! We got to eat there!While I guess there is no guarantee this would happen to you, I can say this approach was absolutely worth it for me. Where else are you going to eat:-a deboned quail stuffed in ricotta and wrapped in pork, covered in lobster broth and chunks of lobster-foie gras in a ravioli immersed in duck broth-French fries fried in beef fat-Veal sweetbreads covered in braised antelope and mushroom gravy -the most delicious hazelnut chocolate ganache almond and vanilla cream cake I've ever had-lobster spaghetti (ok to be fair you can get this at their sister restaurant nearby)They also have their own branded sparkling wine!Interestingly there is a garden in the back but I'd be hard pressed to name many or any vegetables in the meal we ordered here.

/user_details?userid=_Le3iFzaVcwMQXBUUMNZ3g,Jon T.,"Rocky River, OH",5 star rating,"Decided to come here. Got a reservation same day. Arrived on time, sat around 6:15 because the staff was having a prep meeting.Decor was comfortable. Leather and wood, candles on tables, dim interior, walls filled with interesting knick-knacks, strings of lights. Romantic, classic restaurant vibe. We sat in the second room, in a row of two tops opposite an extensive wooden bar counter. There was also an attractive covered patio with heat lamps. Noise level was a pleasant bustle, intriguing rather than irritating.Friendly and helpful wait staff - from welcome to service to departure. No individually written menus - everything is on chalkboards. As many others have noted, this means that we leaned heavily on conversation with the attentive staff and they helped select our menu to a large degree. Recitation of the entire menu in French or English, selection recommendations and the advice ""if something caught your attention while you were listening, get it!"" This because the menu changes frequently. If I had to say something less than positive it would mention the pacing of service - everyone had such extensive interaction with the wait staff and it felt like we needed to wait our turn occasionally.Shared everything. If there is too much variety and not enough decisiveness, getting several starters and one entree seems like a great idea.Starters: foie gras tart with fresh apple and textually complementary crust, garnished with shaved celery root waves and a dollop of bone marrow & foie gras parfait. The second dish was a stew of beans, root veg, and tripe served encircling roasted bone marrow. Satisfying to the extreme. Really wished for a bit of bread to sop up the gravy-like remains.Entrees: perpetually available spaghetti with thick bacon bits and lobster - left delicious grease all over our lips, easy to shell, and as decadent as advertised. Was skeptical but there is a reason why this dish is always on the menu. Our second dish was smoked rabbit prepared several ways, alongside fresh bacon, homemade sauerkraut, and house mustard. Tasty but frankly I am wondering how much better the rare roast beef, veal liver, the sharable 32oz steak or the steakhouse sausage entrees might have been. (Pictures of most of the menu attached).Dessert: enormous apple pie we almost skipped. Ordered after the couple next to us got it as well. Puff pastry, apple halves, caramel sauce and a heaping twist of fresh vanilla ice cream. Amazing if you are in the mood. Other options included layer cake, squash baked good with ice cream (w/ sparkler if you've just gotten married), and vanilla ice cream twisted with apple sorbet.Dinner was great - go here if you like food."

As tourists coming to Montreal for the first time, we tried in vain to book a table online for the one weekend we would be in town. Unfortunately, there wasn't a table free for another few months after our visit to the city. Months! So instead, I called the restaurant on a weekday prior to our trip, requested a table, and landed a reservation for a table by the bar. Lesson learned: if you can't get a table online, call them!Second, the food. The menu is totally in French but the servers all speak English, so ask questions! They'll be happy to answer you. We ordered a variety of items - the sturgeon croquettes, steak, the cod in a cream sauce, a side salad (which is enormous, by the way), hazelnut cake, and drinks. Everything was delicious - the steak and cod were the standouts and perfectly cooked. Comfort food at its best, and quality is top-notch. Overall, Joe Beef, while heavy on the wallet, is very unpretentious, casual, boisterous with a very intimate, home-style atmosphere. There's a reason for the rave reviews, and if you're in town, whether tourist or local, I'd definitely recommend this spot. For two people, with tax, tip, drinks, our total was around $154.00."

I always thought, if I have to eat meat, better make it really good and worth it. And it was! First, we shared the deer tartare which... I really have no word for it. It just melted in the mouth, the deer as well as the bread. Then, we shared the pork ribs and shoulder and the duck breast. I can't tell which was my favorite. Meat was tender, the sauces were original, like nothing I've tasted before, simply delicious. The service was excellent.

Right away, we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. They seated us at our reserved time. There were no menus given to us. The entire menu was written on a big blackboard on one of the walls in the restaurant. To start, we ordered the half sour and crab dip ($13). This dish was cold and flavourless and on top of that, we were not given any bread. We ordered bread, which was $2.50 by the way, and were only given two slices, some butter that we didn't use and half a pickle that we didn't eat.Although our appetizer wasn't too appetizing, I would have to say that our main course was outstanding. I had the Spaghetti Lobster ($49). This dish was superb. There was a lot of meat to the lobster and the pasta was perfectly al dente. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Joe Beef Monsieur ($49). He was ecstatic with how savoury his steak was. We would definitely come here again for dinner. First Class, A-1.Bon appétit!"

Called on Tuesday and was able to get a reservation for 2 on Saturday 7pm at the bar.We arrived 10 minutes early and was seated immediately. The bartender was friendly and his drink suggestions were on point! The menu on the wall is only in French, but the staff is more than willing to talk through the menu. We ordered bouef cru comme une waldorf (AMAZING) to share and then the petites lasagnes and the ribeye d'Hemmingford. We finished the meal with the renverse a la framboise!

/user_details?userid=sdqKBWtl4Mdb3CttLfRLww,Natalie L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"It's been a few days since we left Montreal and I still think about the meal we had at Joe Beef every day. I've eaten at several fine dining establishments in my life and this was easily too 2. We had the waitress with short blond hair (don't remember her name), and she was INCREDIBLE. She suggested we do the ""Joe Beef experience"" - a tasting menu that she chose for us. I am so glad we made that choice. She brought us five appetizers - a seafood platter (crab legs, oysters, and the razor clams),  smoked veal croquettes, ham with browned butter and white asparagus, beef carpaccio with breaded oysters, and mozzarella with caviar. Everything was incredible - we walked in barely hungry but couldn't stop eating. Each round was better than the last. Our favorites were the sweet crab legs, the veal croquettes (smoky with a lovely creamy dill sauce), and the thinly sliced ham with brown butter and a Dijon mayo sauce. For an entree, we split the steak au poivre (cooked perfectly medium rare and with a tangy, light but creamy sauce) and the Joe Beef fries, which I found perfectly crispy (my partner didn't like them as much). We somehow had room for dessert after all this and split the cruller donut (stuffed w cream) and the sundae with homemade hot fudge and cherry sorbet. The sundae was our least favorite part of the meal and that is really saying something for us. I had a gin and tonic made with a local gin which was delicious. Our entire experience was lovely - we had to wait a few minutes for our table but instead of waiting by the entrance, we were brought to the raw bar to order drinks. The staff was fantastic, from the men working the raw bar to our waitress, who deserves a serious raise, to the very conscientious bussers. Every single part of our meal was perfection. We can't wait to go back for our next meal (and try different seasonal dishes)! I'd make the drive from Boston just for this."

We're from the states and knew that it was very hard to get a reservation. You will be called beforehand and asked to confirm it to keep it. I snagged a spot for two on a Wednesday night about two weeks prior. It's a small and intimate restaurant so you can't expect to walk in and be seated. The staff was super awesome and our waitress explained all of main menu items to us in English (she began in French but quickly realized we spoke English). Kudos to everyone who was serving us. Great wine, fabulous cocktails. But really, the food...AMAZING. I went all out and ordered Horse. You read that right, horse. I took some heat from my family and friends about this decision. But when in Canada...why not? It was amazing. So tender and flavorful! I am so glad I tried it. My bf had the lobster spaghetti for an entree. Lots of meat and really amazing. We split the oyster appetizer beforehand. OMG so many different flavors! I recommend if you're going all out. I need to also point out the bathrooms...there is a giant buffalo in it. Kudos to the decorators for including this in the restaurant! Drinks were amazing and this is a perfect night out if you don't mind spending the money on something fabulous."
/user_details?userid=kXB_T2i7gyUYcMYxrGgC-w,Michael L.,"Menifee, CA",1 star rating,"I was stoked to be eating at one of the ""best"" restaurants Montreal has to offer. It was also at one point mentioned by Jimmy Kimmel on TV and Anthony Bourdain. I was truly excited. Make no mistake. Unfortunately...it was an utter disappointment for me. We ordered drinks and started with an appetizer that sounded the best. Mozarella appetizer with corn...on a bed of squash...insert whatever crap fancy description that got me to buy this at $20...It was simply a cut of bread...deep fried...with corn and squash on top. I'm not underestimating this...it was downright flavorless. The Mozarella was nice but nothing mind blowing. Flavors painfully missing. Insult to injury? It was barely shareable...like 1 piece of bread I can get at my local market.Despite this I ordered their signature dish. Lobster spaghetti! OH YOU JUST HAVE TO GET THISS GUYSSS! YOU JUST HAVE TO GETTTT THISSS! No...I'm kidding. Run the hell away from it. Getting this is what people keep advocating. Blowing it up to living hell in terms of flavor expectations. So what did I do? I trusted them and ordered this. It was literally flavorless. Nothing about the actual spaghetti tasted of lobster. Rather like shoving spaghetti and bland flavorless heavy cream in my mouth. Lobster itself had flavor of course...but not the dish as a whole. The server asked how it was and I was at a loss for words. I said I want to be honest. IT'S BLAND! And this even after I asked for salt to bring flavor to this dead seaport dish...no cross that...a dead fish would probably have more flavor than this dish. I am not exaggerating.She claimed it was the first time she ever heard this to her surprise. I was personally just as surprised. I kept asking what it's actually SUPPOSED to taste like. And she mentioned ...spaghetti...light lobster flavor. I said uhm ok...well....it's horribly bland. Could they have messed up?? She said impossible since it's the same recipe they've been making for years. I was so confident this dish was bland and tasteless I was OK with her or even the chef giving it a taste. But she didn't do that and instead offered a replacement dish...seeing as how I was actually STRUGGLING to finish this horribly overpriced and tasteless dish..I declined. I simply was full from the crappy pasta I had to endure. I still paid for my lobster spaghetti...but they should have taken it off the bill without me having to ask...in fact I let my server know that I really wanted to like the dish...but utter disappointment to which she said ""I did offer a replacement dish, you could have said yes."" True...but if I decline another crappy overpriced dish...just remove it from the bill. Oh well. My charity of the week. One thing is absolutely clear to me: Joe Beef is nothing but shitty, overpriced hype. Don't let the exclusivity of the reservations make you feel like you're missing out or believe the ""best dining experience in mahhh LIFE!"" reviews. Those people clearly haven't dined at some ACTUALLY amazing places.Avoid...AVOID...AVOID"

It was value for money though I would have preferred a more oily part of the fish.- sundae and hazelnut cake: sundae was a flavor of pear imported  from Europe and topped with honey crumbs.

Previously known to bolster items such as the double down foie gras, the once notoriously overly decadent gastropub serves these days a much more refined and locally sourced seasonal menu. I came here expecting greasy and fried dishes that would require hours on the treadmill to compensate for, but left amazed by the freshness and quality of the produce. Don't get me wrong, this is not a healthy place, but it's definitely a gastropub refined in it's highest form. We actually started off the evening with a bit of a hiccup as we were forced to wait over 30 mins past our reservation time. However, the lovely waitress assigned to us more than made up for the poor seating time management. Yes, that means we got free stuff!!! Enough to make even hungry Sally aka my fat girl alter ego excuse the mishap. Free drinks, lemonade, appetizer, dessert... Sally was happy :)As for what we actually ordered, we started off with a dish of cured wild boar topped with rhubarb and shaved parmesan. Not something I've ever seen on a menu before and I can't think why not, as it was delicious. Tasted kinda like prosciutto but less salty and a bit more gamey. We continued with a full quail breast braised in an escargot fondue sauce. The quail was oh so juicy and when mixed with the earthy velvety fondue it was a match made in heaven!For mains, we opted for our own combination of surf and turf as we shared the steelhead trout and the sub-marine steak. Best piece of seared fish I have ever tasted in my life! The skin was perfectly crispy yet the meat inside was still a solid medium-rare. My logical guess is that they must have cooked it sous-vide before frying it. The steak, although a cheaper flank cut, was seasoned perfectly and accompanied with the classical sub-marine toppings of cheese, lettuce and tomates. You must be thinking, the heck?! But trust me, the flavours paired perfectly together. So well in fact that we made no use of their home made steak sauce that came along with it. Of course any solid wine and dine experience calls for some good vino. No worries, as Joe Beef also delivered on that aspect. Not only do they import their own wine but they also feed off the experience of running the Vin et Papillon wine bar next door. Needless to say, they have some excellent offerings to please any palate. This place really is the epitome of the 'chasse et pêche' experience in my books. Not only are they true artists in putting together a menu that highlights Quebec's produce in fish, game and meat, but the tavern like decor and relaxed ambiance really ties everything perfectly together. Easily one of the best meals I've had in Montreal. Good thing it's extremely hard to get a decent booking at this place as hungry Sally is just begging for more!"

That said, Joe Beef is SO worth it.At night, the space has an unpretentious romanticism to it: soft lighting, lots of fun and strange decor to gaze at, with the sometimes changing menu written on a large chalkboard on one side of the room. Oh and the best food service staff I've ever encountered. We arrived around our 9:45pm reservation time, and the kind host informs me that our table is still occupied, which was expected. Realizing our wait would be a while, the host thanked us for our patience, took our coats, and another server came by to take our wine order. Finally our server, the wonderful Alexandra came by to welcome us and carefully explain the menu (my boo speaks some French, I speak none). By the time we got to our table, we were a little tipsy and very ready to grub. Our order: Blue Point Connecticut Oysters - Simple, fresh, delicious. Served with lemon, horseradish, cocktail sauce, and a vinegary sauce on the side. Oh and Joe Beef's own hot sauce. Which, along with a little lemon squeeze, I used to season my little oyster. Perfection.Breaded Head Cheese  - Great execution, the breading on the head cheese adding a nice texture, sitting on light greens and topped with a mustard seed sauce and tartar sauce. Boo isn't a fan of mustardy or pickley things, but for someone who usually doesn't eat head cheese, I loved it. Lobster Spaghetti - Perfectly divided and meaty pieces of lobster with spaghetti pasta in a creamy tomato sauce. Popular for a reason. Kinda wish we had a little bread to go with it. Otherwise, it was the bomb-diggety. Vanilla Berry Soft Serve Swirl - Great end to the meal, served with pieces of meringue and cranberries. We were one of a few couples who were out on a nice little dinner date, and let me just say that there is something about Joe Beef's ambience and vibe that makes it great for a special night with that special one. Alexandra was charming, knowledgeable, and super helpful in our food decision, making sure that we didn't order too much or too little. Towards the end of the evening she shared a little bonus taste of sparkling dessert wine. Her hospitality and down-to-earth attentiveness was so wonderful that we hugged at the end. While the food was some of the best we've ever had, the service blew our experience out of the water. Thanks Alexandra!!!While Joe Beef ain't the most inexpensive place in the world, it is definitely a place to consider for a special occasion. Can't wait to come back here, hmm... my birthday?"

It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. - Corn chowder was delicious too - For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. - I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer."

We were thrilled to get a great table at Joe Beef on short notice when we first arrived in Montreal at the beginning of the summer.Believe the hype. The food is that good. However, my experience was frustrating and a bit disappointing. I'm in a province that speaks French so of course I wouldn't expect them to accommodate English speakers if they didn't feel like it. But the menu is written in chalk in two or three locations throughout the restaurant. It is scrawled and cramped on the board and the light is low. First they stood us in the middle of a dining room in the back to view the menu. We did our best to translate the dishes we didn't recognize with a translation program on our phones but it was awkward being in the way of the servers who kept needing to move all around us while we were hovering above nearby dinner guests. We didn't have time to really get through many dishes before they sat us at our table. We could not read the menu in that dining room at all. It was far away and behind us in a dark room. There were no menus available for us to have at our tables.This put some pressure on our server to just sit down and tell us our options.I found this irritating especially because the menu is so complex and amazing. When I go to restaurant, I like to know all my options. I love pasta, but not if has corn of any sort. I love sauces but not usually if they are mayo-based. I love salmon but will frequently prefer a vegetarian dish to seafood especially if the vegetarian dish has cream-based sauce or a type of cheese I like and providing it doesn't have onions in large chunks. I love blue cheese but raclette will make me feel ill just at the scent of it. I love savory pancakes and pies but I don't usually enjoy beef or lamb in them unless the meat is more of an accent to the dish. You get the idea. One ingredient can elevate a dish to extremely desirable to me or render it entirely inedible. I want to study the menu and take time to understand the dishes and make decisions based on all of my idiosyncratic sensitivities.The discussion-style explanation to me didn't give me the chance to do any of this because it sort of went, ""What kinds of dishes do you enjoy?"" Or, ""Well we have this one thing. How does it sound?"" So it wasn't a real overview. Our server, S., was a phenomenal server and it wasn't a failing on her part at all. She put us at ease when I was clearly ruffled, she did her best to make the experience wonderful. Her warmth, attention and knowledge of the menu helped to make up for the irritations. If it wasn't for her we would have left.As she went through and tried to explain the vast menu, we ended up deciding on the cracked crab as our first starter, the croquettes with Montreal smoked meat as our second. I then had the lamb cannelloni. My husband, the rabbit three ways. We ordered three desserts. Though I don't remember all of them now! The wine that was suggested for us was perfect. We drank too much but it was hard to say no to another glass! As I said, everything was amazing but I was still disappointed in my dish because it was just too lamb-y. I guess I don't like lamb that much. But I felt pressed to decide in order to avoid further taking the time of our wonderful waitress because she had already been sitting with us for some time while we decided on what my husband would order. I still wonder what seasonal delectable awesomeness may have been on that menu that could have provided me with a peak dining experience that I will never know about. I have a slight sense of loss about this because I don't live in Montreal and the number of times I will be able to eat at Joe Beef is limited. Well, we're back in Montreal and we will be going again. My plan is to stop in about an hour before our reservation, snap a shot of the menu and then go sit and have a cocktail somewhere so we can do some sleuthing and parse out the options."

I guess I just thought that it would be too difficult to get a reservation, so I just gave up.Then I heard about this app called DINR where you could get last minute reservations for some of the best restaurants in town. A few days later, I secured a reservation at the bar on a Wednesday night. The service was impeccable, from start to finish. I had oysters, scallop ceviche, a soup with bone marrow and sweetbreads. The meal was interesting, dynamic and delicious. I can't wait to go back."

The lobster spaghetti was okay, but everything else was below average. Also, the service was horrible. We waited a good 45 minutes between our second appetizer and receiving our entrees. We just sat there with nobody coming by. When it came time for the bill, it took another half hour to get the bill pay the bill and leave. We did notice that a lot of the servers were sitting down with the guys and getting them drunk. That might explain the good rating."

This lively gastropub is tucked in the middle of St. Henri/Griffintown. The service is excellent (our table got delayed by 45 minutes but the waiters made sure we had a place to sit at the bar while waiting and gave us appetizers on the house). We ordered two of their signature dishes: lobster spaghetti and Rib-eye steak with black pepper sauce and both of the dishes were amazing. The lobster spaghetti was so rich that I was sure it was made entirely of cream and butter and the lobster was cooked to perfection. The steak came a perfect medium topped off with a fried egg on the top. Both portions were enormous.Although our bill was quite hefty (we also ordered wine), we felt like for the quality and quantity of our food fully justified the price. Do make sure that you reserve ahead of time (I had to reserve 2 months ahead of time for a Friday night dinner). PROS: amazing food, great atmosphere, Montreal classicCONS: long waiting time, need to reserve way ahead of time"

/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! Pros:1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. Cons: 1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.To try next time: - Lobster spaghetti - Rib steak for 2"

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I always think of Joe Beef as being one of the top restaurants in Montreal. However, on my latest visit they did not live up to their reputation. The food was good but far from outstanding and the service was also good but not at the highest level. The prices however, remain high.I eat at Joe Beef ever now and then and always greatly anticipate my visits. I expect to love the food but have been disappointed on my last visit. At our last meal at Joe Beef I found the food not to be up to its usual level. There were three items that disappointed us. In the buffalo mozzarella entree the fine flavour of the smoked cheese was completely overpowered by the overly strong sour flavour of the pickled vegetables. The cheese should be the star of this dish but you could not even taste it. We then had the lobster pasta which use to be served with a delicate bisque that was so wonderful I would have loved the dish even if there had not been an entire lobster sitting on the plate! This week the sauce was think and heavy and not nearly as enjoyable. We also had the halibut, which I expected to be light and melt in your mouth perfection. Unfortunately the fish was heavy and very chewy. One other disappointment was the server who took our desert order (not the same person who took the rest of our order). When describing the ice cream she failed to mention that there were nuts in this dish. Luckily my wife, who is allergic to pistachios and cashews, noticed the topping before digging in and possibly sending herself into anaphylactic shock. This same topping of nuts was also on the Hazel Nut cake and again our server failed to mention it. I was shocked that at a restaurant of this quality a server would fail to mention such an important detail."

If you reserve through the actual Joe Beef website, it is booked a few months out. We got there at 630 on a Thursday and the place was packed. We were seated at a tiny table which had very little space between other tables. It was cramped. The inside was dark and stuffy. The menu was written on a blackboard tucked in a dark corner with words i could hardly decipher. I felt frustrated for not being able to review the menu. We had to rely on our server. She was so awesome but i still would have wanted to review the menu by myself to determine what i wanted to eat that  night given the options. Anyway, we went with our server's recommendations on what to order based on the lobster spaghetti dish we had set our mind on. The smoked meat croquettes came in 4 teeny tiny pieces for $15. I thought it was overpriced. The stuffed quail was good. We also had 2 oysters each and 1 scallop each, all very fresh. For our main course, we shared the lobster spaghetti which was delightful. The lemon tart for dessert was too sour for me. The bill was around $180 including tip. Personally, i wasn't blown away by the overall experience. I felt cramped the whole night, couldn't get out of my seat without the fear of toppling over the drinks of the ones beside us. The food took forever to come out...i would say around 45 min just for the oysters to come out which don""t even need to be cooked. Dining for me is not just about the food but the overall experience and unfortunately it wasn't what i was expecting."
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I have wanted to come here for a few years now, and finally got a reservation! The meal was really great, and it was a nice vibe inside. We had the mozzarella di buffalo in a corn cream sauce, the hangar steak, the lobster pasta, zucchinis, best French fries (that was the highlight), and the crueller dessert. I think there was a slip up, as I asked for my steak to be well done as I am pregnant, but it came out quite red inside, so I don't think it was well done, but nevertheless, it tasted amazing! The interplay between the parsley, the seasonings and the steak was delightful. I would say that my only recommendation is to have the menu written in English,as there are so many tourists and English speaking folks coming here. But the servers are all fluent in English and will explain the menu to you. It would be nice to have the menu printed daily, as we had to take a picture of the menu and read it off our phones, as we weren't privy to the best view of the chalkboard. Compared to Toronto, prices are reasonable for this quality of food. The only other recommendation was that we were asked to wait outside for our table, as we were there 5 mins early. That wasn't the best, or warmest reception that I've encountered at this calibre of restaurant."

The first time I went , it deserved a 5 stars , the 2nd time I went a 5 as well , the reason I gave it a 4 on the 3rd time was because the food was actually not that great. I was so so surprised being such a big fan. Joe beef is one of those places where things seemed to be seasoned to perfection but for once in my life it was extremely over seasoned . It was salty to the point where it was quite painful to eat. I will definitely still come back because I consider it one of my favourite restaurants."

/user_details?userid=v8y6IKzGH0oMqA5v76GHKg,Cyndi K.,"Baltimore, MD",4 star rating,"We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad."
/user_details?userid=QX1UciS9sSwgYoanAPyUFA,Laura J.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others."

So I explained what we didn't like and let the waitress take us from there.Food: The staff was on point with everything they brought out. We were served smoked eel croquettes, the pistachio apple radicchio salad, lobster spaghetti, joe's roast beef, guinea fowl, donuts, soft served vanilla ice cream and their 16 layer cake. For someone who doesn't like eel, the croquettes were very well presented and almost tasted like there was bacon within, not eel. The salad had homemade croutons and a dressing I could not pin point but was extremely tasty and light before the heavier dishes came out.

It's fantastic that the menu changes on a regular basis, however you would expect a restaurant titled ""Joe Beef"" to have a sirloin of some sorts. There was rabbit, duck, horse, etc. We ordered a leek and lobster appetizer for $17 which was under-cooked, bland and had five tiny pieces of lobster. We order the salisberry steak that was drowned in gravy and tasted and resembled a  giant meatball. LOL We also order the kessler, belly and rib plate that was buried in sauerkraut, with no differentiation of taste between the pork ribs, belly and steak.  Overall, the meal was over $150.

Seeing as its in the top of Canada's best restaurants and we love food. We went on our last night(with a reservation) and anyone we spoke to said we were definitely in for a treat. We were so excited to see what our night held. When we arrived, we were told that we didn't have a reservation. Yikes!!  She checked and unfortunately my husband had mistakenly made it for the following week. Our hearts sank but she told us that she would fix it for us. We waited a couple of minutes and then she came back to take us to sit at the bar.  What a relief!  It's a cool and quirky place that has the menu written on a chalkboard because the menu is based on what's currently available. The tables are close together and the seats were all full but it still felt cozy. The guy behind the bar introduced himself as ""David, the English menu"". He translated and explained the whole menu for us. There were so many options that it was hard to decide. However, we did know that we wanted to have the lobster spaghetti. We started with the Montreal-smoked Meat croquettes, grilled asparagus with shaved white ham and cheese and smoked Arctic char. The portions were perfect and everything was delicious. The spaghetti was incredible and not a drop was wasted. After all, that's what bread is for. Even after all that food, we still had room for dessert.

The veal tartare was so fresh and amazing! The dressing on the salad was like an explosion in my mouth !!! I'd say the best tatare I've ever had and I love tartare...After came the Quebec lamb, the piece of resistance paired with a nice Pinot noire suggested by waitress ! The size was huuuuge and presented in a nice casserole with potatoes, carrots and other veggies. It was the perfect dish to share, the lamb just fell off the bone and the sauce really complemented everything especially the veggies. Last step was dessert, again took the waitress's recommendation with an ""Easter Sunday"" after asking for something light I was a little scared lol when it came out it was a beautiful sorbet with lots of colour and different kinds of flavours all made in the restaurant of course. Perfect way to end the meal, skipped the coffee since it was midnight and felt like sleeping !A well deserved 5 star review !!!! If you want the full experience with a bottle of wine expect around 150$ person or if you just want to go for main course like 50$."

The waiters were somewhat slow to come take our orders and never really checked on us during the dinner. They also forgot one of our appetizers. On top of that, we ordered the lobster spaghetti with bacon and it came without. Too many mistakes for a restaurant of this quality. Food-wise, I shared the joe beef steak and the lobster spaghetti and I thought both were very tasty. If I'd have to pick between the 2, I think Id go with their lobster spaghetti. The Bloody Caesar are very good but they are a bit on the pricey side (16$).I also liked the vibe of this restaurant. We sat outside on the patio overlooking the impressively large vegetable garden."

There was a small error which our reservation and it was fixed promptly. We were seated promptly at the bar on arrival. Nelson was our bartender and waiter. He made many suggestions and explained the entrees in English. I started with Gamay which was nice. I had the scallop and oyster platter for 1. Sooo good!! My spouse had the buffalo mozzarella with cherry tomatoes and onions. Very good. For dinner my spouse and I shared the aged beef for 2. It came with a side of beans and greens. It was very good, but the aged beef was slightly ..a little more dry than anticipated. It was still very tasty and cooked nicely.  There was a tiny spill accident on my lap and the servers promptly make sure I was ok and cleaned everything very thoroughly. They were very apologetic and gave us a free drink, which was very nice. They also have us some strawberry soft serve ice cream with a sparkler for my spouse birthday on the house.

Joe Beef barely made it into our plans on our last night in Montreal but I am SO glad it did. Amongst all the wonderful restaurants we went to, Joe Beef absolutely blew all of the other restaurants out of the water. The food is phenomenal but what really made our night was the incredible, incredible service. We sat at the bar (I love sitting at the bar), and our two servers/bartenders took such great care of us. The attention to detail, the unpretentiousness and just the genuine desire to make you, as a customer, happy made this one of my most memorable dining experiences that I will never stop gushing about. We will definitely be back again! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!Now onto the food...Veal tongue - super tender and flavorful, very generous portionsLobster spaghetti with bacon - omg this was every bit as good as everyone says it is. Super generous with lobster and the sauce is perfection.Cheval steak - bacon wrapped and topped with an egg. The man friend loved it. My first time trying horse meat and it was pretty tasty. The winning bite is actually eating the steak with the sauce from the lobster spaghetti. That was POW...delicious!Hazelnut cake - slice of heaven. Moist and not too sweet.

My group was so excited to get a reservation at this restaurant and didn't know the sadness that would follow. The menu, first of all, is hidden under a dim light with ineligible cursive writing. Their trick is to let the waitress come over and suggest the plates for you to order. She of course suggests the meals that are either expensive or the food that is probably overdue and they need to get rid of. In our case, we were all poisoned and it ruined our night and the next day as well. Disappointment all around for us. I hope ""Joe"" is proud."

So, you order more than you should but it's completely worth it because every single dish exceeds your expectations.  Chef David McMillan came out as dinner was winding down and chit chatted with the guests.  Chatting with him was an experience in itself!

I had to book 3 months in advance!!!The staff is wonderful, everyone was nice and very amiable, and they all seemed laid back and relaxed. Service here is good, except I don't rate on service just food.I was hoping to try the foie gras burger, where the buns are fried foie gras slabs instead of bread, cuz you know I'm on a low carb diet lol but sadly it is no longer on the menu.We ordered a half portion of the lobster pasta, which is one of the signature dishes here, the salade gourmande, the smoked duck and soft shell crab appetizer.Of all the dishes, only the soft shell crab was really good, it was lightly battered and fried, serve on slices of zucchini with a nice vinaigrette. Light and fresh, crispy tempered with soft.The lobster spaghetti was disappointing, it was super rich and yet bland. It could have used a little more salt or cheese. The shell was not exactly pre-cracked so it was a chore to get the flesh out. The portion was huge even for half portion, and the spaghetti was cooked al dente just right, when the dish got cold it wasn't soggy.The salade gourmande was good, it had foie gras and terrine, boiled egg string beans and apple slices. Taste and textures were nice, the whole thing was topped with a few leafs of lettuce. We were warned that it wasn't really a salad, but it stood up to its name ""gourmande"" . It was pleasant but I felt like it needed a hint of sweet somewhere to balance out the the fat from the foie gras and terrine, a chutney or some glaze would have been nice.The smoked duck had a very nice flavor but it was very dry. We had to dip it in the thick glazed sauce for every bite. In the end, we got this sauce overload after taste and it became very salty to finish. The roasted bulbs of shallots and mushroom were very tasty but did little to temper the salty sauce. I think roasted carrots or root vegetables would have been nice.All in all, disapointing, what's all the hype about?"

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"No words will do justice to the food here.I've been meaning to come to Joe Beef for a while now, I mean I'm a native Montrealer and just never got the chance while droves of tourists, Anthony Bourdain followers and every chef on earth has been coming here for years.So with last minutes changes, somehow  I finally came last week for a 6pm seating.My dinner companion friend and I were not disappointed. I've seen the photos, I know the call, I knew even before I sat down what I was going to have. For lovers of seafood, the East Coast oysters here are a ""must"". Briny, juicy and plump and shelled right upon ordering, a quirt of lemon juice is all you need to happily slurp these beauties down.Which then brings me to the Bloody Ceasar. Served in a Mason jar, a stalk of celery, a pickle and an olive dunked within along with a giant shrimp and a single oyster in the half-shell sitting across the mouth of the jar, with spiced chilli salt rimmed around the glass, *THIS* should be the new normal of how all Bloody Caesars should be served the world over, in my humble opinion.I knew I wanted dessert so I knew I couldn't go overboard on everything so to pace myself, I deliberately got a light starter, in this case the watercress soup. If you like things which taste green-ey then you'll love this soup. If on the other hand, green smoothies are not your thing, don't get this. The garlic bread slices which it came with were perfect. I got the spaghetti lobster, a whole flippin lobster, claws, tails and legs, cooked, cracked open, sauteed in some God-knows-what-rich-fatty buttery with parsley concoction along with spaghetti. I was brought up to clean my plate off  and while I was inching closer and closer to the explosion mark, I figured to be good, at least I could polish off the lobster meat, which I did. It turns out I should not have felt so bad. They do doggie bags here, so that rich spaghetti I left on my plate, I was able to take home with me to nosh on the next day.My friend had I think a Cornish game hen, deep breaded with panko, sitting in another ungodly rich sauce. He finished of his bird and had to take the sauce home. I tried a bite and it was also delicious. We also spied over at the table next to us. The couple had ordered probably the most amazing cuts of steak I've seen in a long while, large enough to probably feed a village in Bangladesh . They too were relieved to learn they could take it home as well.For dessert I had the infamous Gateau Marjolaine. Good thing it was a thin slice because this was one of the richest cakes I've had in a while. Because it was my birthday, I got a sparkly candle too! Service was outstanding. Our waitress explained all the dishes to  us and the wine lists as well. After every course, our tables were wiped down, and I even saw Fred and Dave lurking in the back .This is a bucket list restaurant. If you live in Montreal, you have to come here at some point. No excuses."

The ambience, service, and atmosphere were great, and the very affable bartender recommended a lovely Romanian red wine. The food, however, is extremely overhyped and overpriced. I had the buffalo mozzarella salad to start, which was quite good, and then the steak fritt, which was basically a New York strip with duck fat fries. The fries were tasty, but the steak, which was the most expensive item on the menu at $55 Canadian, was nowhere near worthy of that price point. It was ok, but it was pretty flavorless and needed seasoning of some sort; I've had better steaks on the grill at home from my dad. I would try it again and order something much less expensive, but overall it was rather disappointing."

It lost a star for a few small reasons that added up and irked me:  the chalkboard in French was overwhelming and stressful to take in and the service was slow. I got roasted by the outdoor heater on one side (my contact lens dried up, making it even harder to read the board...), and our table was weirdly huge and everyone was sitting 2ft apart (party of 4) in enormous chairs.

We had great service as the staff was very friendly,efficient &welcoming and they definitely knew the menu inside out. While the inside was pretty small it was cozy but without feeling like everyone was stuck together. We enjoyed everything that we ordered. We started with the sturgeon croquettes , they were nice and crispy on the outside and very tasty and flavourful on the inside and not oily at all. We then had the lobster pasta and the venison dish. The lobster pasta was nice and creamy made with lobster bisque and a ton of fresh flavourful lobster meat and the venison was cooked and seasoned to perfection with a great sear on the outside and foie gras on top. The meal was delicious and I could eat it again and again ! for dessert we ordered espresso and a slice of layered cake to share , the espresso was bold and well made and the dessert complimented it very well , the cake was fresh and not too overly sweet and really topped off the meal well. While the meals are a little bit pricey it was worth it for the quality of food and service. I would recommend this place to anyone for a nice date night and even if you're just in the mood for some great food! definitely make a reservation in advance as this place books up quick and I can see why !"

The menu can be overwhelming, but our waitress sat down and helped us craft an entire meal complete with wine. The food was great. I wouldn't say it was mind blowingly good but it was delicious nonetheless. The menu changes daily based on what's available at the local farmers market so you know you're eating fresh ingredients from a constantly changing menu. Very unique, though they do have some staple items like their famous steak and lobster pasta. It honestly felt like I was eating at a friend's place and enjoying a decadent meal with a few close friends (with the wine pouring of course). Our waitress was gregarious. She engaged everyone, joked with people, drank and toasted with us and genuinely made us feel like we were long lost friends. It was so much fun.

The food was really just OK.  We asked our server for suggestions based on our preferences and he said they had tuna for the only time this year.  We ordered that and also a hanger steak.  Somehow the tuna and the steak had the same dark caper sauce.  The sauce was overpowering for the rather thin piece of tuna which was overcooked."

And it was! I left quit a bit of unchewable fat and gristle on my plate and the cost was $60 before tax for a 2nd or 3rd rate steak. Service was very good and very helpful but it's too jammed in and tight for me. But obviously it's fine for a lot of people.

/user_details?userid=EMgEqxfEHBx01s_vA_bhNw,Michael G.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Top ten meal.  Whenever I told anyone I was going to Montreal they mentioned Joe's Beef.   Two friends and I were in for the weekend.  Last night it was two of us.  My dining companion's flight was late and I waited for about 40 minutes at at the bar.  What first stuck me other than the appeal of the hipster-foodie/lumberjack decor and vibe was how totally nice yet casual every person working there was. The bartender made me a killer vodka Moscow Mule. He then translated the entire menu, written on a board, to me.  The menu is almost shocking in its combinations of oddness, strange coherence and it's outright appeal. Ordering would require a lot of thought. The hostess knew I was waiting for a late friend.  She kept coming by to check on me to make sure I knew they they where cool with her being late and to make sure I was happy.  When Karen came the bartenders and others were audibly happy enough that the woman next to me asked us who we were. We ordered three appetizers and two mains.  We made a comment like ""We are ordering a lot.""  Our sweet and funky server said ""Oh no.  There is no ordering too much here.  Everyone eats here.""The first dish was a smoked beef ragu pappardelle with a fried egg.  It's was fantastic; eye-rolling. Next came a dish Karen ordered.  A crab dish with a soft boiled egg encased in a savory jell.  I had now intention of eating it because of a mild crab allergy but when I saw the contrast between the rustic salad-like crab covered in fingerling chips and the elegant egg which frankly looked like a desert you would see in a bakery in Vienna I had to check it out.  The chips where fried in crab fat. I'll repeat that.  The chips where fried in fricken crab fat.  It's was worth the hives. The final appetizer was a split toasted long roll with a mixture of local mushrooms and morrel with a light ham, ramps, fiddle heads and a mornay sauce. It came to us with each saying we where topped off and would only taste it so we could also try the mains.  We polished the entire thing off.  Quickly. It's was amazing. For my main I had a dish of braised pork shoulder, white beans, lettuce and sausage.  It was another eye-roller. The pork was steak-like but cut across the grain and both crisped and falling apart at the same time.  We where both gob smacked and talked for a bit to try to figure out how it was prepared. Karen's main was the petit steak (a meager 10 ounces) topped with smoked beef, provolone and raw tomato served over the most unctuous beef jus I've ever had.  This dish was the first and only stumble of the night. But it was a stumble soon to be turned into virtue by our excellent sever.  The dish was stone cold.  We told the server and she apologized with a slight tinge of doubt in her voice.  She came back 2 minutes later and said with a measure of agony and embarrassment ""You are right it was cold.  We are so sorry.  You will have best hot steak you have ever had in a few minutes.""  It came back and unlike its tepid forbearer it was amazing.  Impressive because the combination could easily be obese-person-food but it was a combination of over the top things that somehow managed to seem subtle and right together (when served hot).   At this point we were both uncomfortably full but Karen went for a dessert.   It was a pretty yet rustic chocolate puff pastry filled with a kirsch chocolate pastry cream roughly coated in chocolate topped with a boozy cherry.  I managed a lick of a spoonful.  It was great and seemed as light as a rustic chocolate puff pastry filled with a kirsch chocolate pastry cream roughly coated in chocolate topped with a boozy cherry can possibly be. Great experience. Amazing food.  Lovely people.  Our mistake was eating at Joe's Beef as our first meal in Montreal.  All of our subsequent carefully chosen meals this weekend will pale in comparison. The third of us is arriving today.  The experience at Joe's will be even more delicious because we are going to tease the shit out of her because she missed a truly stellar frame shifting meal."
/user_details?userid=GqrxbD7nBOWTqBCTXbErbA,Jason F.,"Santa Monica, CA",5 star rating,Joe Beef was fantastic. It reminds me of Le Petit Trois in Los Angeles with 6 times seating capacity and fantastic music that will take you back to your youth (born between 1970-1975) - very casual atmosphere.

Go ask them if it is your first time going or you have no idea about what to order. You need to have reservation otherwise you probably need to wait a while before having a seat.
/user_details?userid=AII0Sf_7xsxf4hMRNCPZ-Q,Lizzie B.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer."

Had the 'bone marrow' pate which had pre mixed bone marrow and other good things , made a paye, and presented it back in a bone. One of the Joe beef guys was at the bar, should he have been in the kitchen?No emphasis on local. No veggies. Isn't it tomato season?Very disappointing. Wine was great. Oysters great Joe beef books and sauces adorning all parts of the block. It's bubba Gump shrimp. Not a 5 star place or close.Fucking disappointing.  And overpriced."

/user_details?userid=33h9Jv4VKbbxB42CUD9WQg,Wahed K.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Joe Beef came up on all our searches while we were planning our Montreal trip so it was in our must-try list. We didn't have a reservation but walked in around 6 pm and got a seat by the bar. It was tight but we managed.There was no printed menu, which was slightly annoying to be honest. I get the whole bohemian approach thing but with my questionable eye sight, it was hard to read what was on the chalk board. After a lot of  questions directed at our waiter, we finally got our order in.First to come was the foie gras double down.  We got the half size to keep things relatively sane. This is one of their staples. It's basically bacon & cheese, topped with chicken skin mayonnaise, sandwiched between deep fried foie gras and drizzled with maple syrup. Maybe ""basically"" was the wrong choice of word. It was as decadent as it sounds but while it was good, it wasn't something I'd order again. In all that richness, I didn't find any umami that resonated in me.Next up, veal tongue with artichoke and red wine reduction sauce. If you like tongue as I do, this is a good dish to try. A lot places tend to overcook tongue coz... well it's tongue, but not here. The red wine reduction sauce was as good as any I've tried and the artichoke balanced the dish out nicely.  One of the dishes I had to try was the lobster spaghetti after I heard my friend gush about it during his visit here a few weeks before mine. The creamy, buttery sauce was cooked with the head of the lobster and tarragon. It seemed to hug the perfectly al dente spaghetti and the soft pieces of lobster. We had to use all our will power not to get bread to mop up the remaining sauce once we were done with the spaghetti. There was no shortage of umami in this dish.Somehow we also ended up with tomato salad. How did that happen? I should thank my wife for insisting we get some veggies. The salad consisted of red and green tomatoes with shaved old goat cheese. It was a welcome change in the program.While we sat at the bar, I was trying to decide on a shot of whiskey to whet the appetite. I saw a bottle of Wiser and told our waiter that I'd never had it. Canadian whiskey is not something many restaurants in NY carry. Even though I just wanted one shot, he poured 3 - one for himself and insisted that my wife have one too. He did charge us just for 1, so I appreciated his hospitality. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal but wasn't easy on the wallet and the meal was very heavy - though the heaviness was a recurring theme throughout our trip. But hey, a little extra cholesterol never hurt anyone**Not a medically proven statement."

They think they are over their ""shit""especially the blond manager. Obviously, they have no respect for customers. Low level of customer service or class. A big reputation for a restaurant is never enough if the service is crappy. Not everything is worth it, there are a lot of good restaurants in Montreal...We ordered duck meal... they should always tell us it is the hole duck! Unfortunately, they didn't and it only show their arrogance. We didn't sent anything back to the kitchen, but we were asked to leave the restaurant before we were done with food and wine... 800$ bills my friends! Basically, the manager kept repeating she was the manager at one inch of my face after a comment a made. I asked her to back off a bit, she really didn't appreciate it and took it personally and believe it was ok to ask customers to leave because of her own ""fit"" she was having. The rest of the staff looked pretty submissive, I bet with some good reasons."

/user_details?userid=cS1fgwsras21qyPPG_Yx1Q,Charles P.,"Aurora, IL",5 star rating,"A quick little blurb about why we even came to Montreal. It was a weekend, I was parked on the couch not feeling hot and waiting for my wife, then girlfriend, to head on over. Bored, I flipped on the TV and what do I see but Anthony Bourdain and these two guys ice fishing in Montreal on an episode of ""Parts Unknown."" I watch for a few more seconds and almost had to sit up when I see what David McMillan and Fred Morin are cooking. Food I had never tasted but had to, wine I had never drank but had to, and suddenly, as the episode kept going, I thought ""wait, why the hell wouldn't we visit Montreal?"" As the months passed, I was able to show the episode to another friend of ours who was like ""I'm in!"" So, doing our homework and seeing the Vice episode as well as The Layover, we felt we got a pretty good read on places to eat and immediately started booking lunches and dinners months in advance. My only other experiences in Canada were way up north on fishing trips my father arranged where you're dropped off for a week a hundred miles from civilization so this was going to be a completely different.We made sure to book 2 dinners at Joe Beef, a night at Nora Gray, a night at PDC, and lunches at L'Express, Toque, and just walked into Dominion Tavern on an unplanned day. But back to Joe Beef. Lordy. This was one of those places where I was so excited to try the food that I felt as if there was no way it could live up to expectations. Like all of us wetting our pants when we saw the Phantom Menace trailer years ago and then confused as all hell for days that it was so bad. Joe Beef was NOT the Phantom Menace. Joe Beef was flat out amazing. The ambiance, the service, the food...my god, the food. Night One: We were a foursome and on night one, from what I can remember, we started with the ham and cheese croquettes as well as a soup and of course, great wine. Our server, Alexandra, was totally down to earth and friendly, great with suggestions and checked on us all the time. For entrees, my wife had the Lobster Spaghetti Homard and I had a huge steak. The one thing that I noticed right off the bat, not just about Joe Beef, but all throughout the restaurants we tried, was that they know how to cook meat in Montreal. I devoured the whole thing. My wife had me try the Lobster Spaghetti and I ended up finishing the final third of hers as well. I immediately knew what my entree would be for night 2. After going through our 2nd bottle of wine, I moved onto dessert which was, if I'm correct, a sour cream ice cream and sorbet mix with fruit. It was huge. I didn't know what to expect when I heard ""sour cream ice cream"" but I figured ""These guys aren't listed as one of the best on the planet cause they screw up."" I tore through it pretty quickly.As we were ending night one, three hours later, I had mentioned in passing to Alexandra that ""I've never tried oysters and I see your boss talking about them all the time."" She walked away and as I was rubbing my gut, knowing I could not eat anymore, she came back, an oyster and an evil grin. ""We have to see you eat one now."" The whole table watched me, including my wife who thought ""there is no way in hell he will handle this texture."" I put the horseradish and lemon in it and down it went. I was converted. Night Two: The very next night, we were back again. This time, Patrick was our server and gave us the best seat in the house, right up front in the window, which my wife was able to get a really memorable photo of as well. Patrick, just like Alexandra, was amazing. So attentive, so informative, so great with the food and wine pairings. We started with the croquettes again but this time, ""Bring us a plate of oysters."" Those were taken out within minutes. My wife just watched in awe, not believing I actually liked them. The night before, Alexandra had actually mentioned to us ""I can get a bucket of oysters and a bottle of white wine and I'm perfect."" I would have to agree with her way of thinking. Then Patrick brought us a few things to try. One being calamari stuffed with lobster sausage. Amazing. Then the entrees arrived. My wife and I switched, she having the steak I had the night before and myself the lobster spaghetti homard. Again, like machines, we went through them, with another bottle of wine. I could eat a meal like this every day...but I'd be 500lbs. We ended the night again with the sour cream ice cream and sorbet and I had a  Another 3 hour Joe Beef marathon completed. In a very nice gesture, David McMillan, who was still on vacation, noticed our tweets that we had checked in and were raving about the place, and sent a couple nice notes on Twitter about not being able to meet. These guys are so down to earth and not only does it come through in their restaurant but their staff is exactly the same. Don't worry, sir. Besides loving Montreal, your restaurant is literally one of the best on the planet. We'll be back again for sure...and again."
/user_details?userid=r7rqMY8KU9HqRiMXHmxfaQ,Connor D.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,"Full Disclosure: This was a birthday dinner, and I got some major perks as I didn't have to pay and also had a bottle of champagne sent to me from a friend. Still, this is in the top, top, top tier of dining establishments. I cannot think of a more excellent and exciting place to celebrate in glutinous fashion.We did not really choose our dishes so much as discuss any likes and dislikes with our server. In addition to the champagne we started with the following:Oysters - east and west coast. These were expertly shucked served on ice. Perfect oysters, amped up a notch by the house green habanero hot sauce.Smoked Eel Croquettes with caviar - I heard about smoked meat croquettes. On our visit we received smoked Eel croquettes with dil, a drop of creme fraiche and a small puddle of black caviar. Damn, find me a better bite than this, because I sure haven't. Best bite of the night. Scallop Crudo - this was excellent, whole raw scallops out of the shell, with macadamia nuts and some sort of crisp plantain maybe? And a smoked creme fraiche. Succulent, sweet, smoky and briney, amped up by the nuts. AMAZING. Joe Beef nails seafood. Top 3 dish of the night.Beef Tartare - again, perfect combination of flavors and textures. Must've been some sort of sesame seed or cracker mixed in along with dots of smokey aioli atop it. No need for crackers, you'll be fighting over this with a spoon. It may look simple but it's more complex and balanced, top notch tartare.Sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage with shredded kohlrabi - I was happy to see this come out, as I know the Joe Beef team loves utilizing offal.  This was fantastic, fairly firm yet creamy sweetbreads in a thin wrap of cabbage. The sauce is insane with this dish. A reduction of foie gras and peppers, it tasted like a decadent, meaty yet thin queso. I would drink it if I could. Lobster Spaghetti (1/2 portion) - look, you know you have to order this. But trust me, worth the hype. Easy to pull the lobster meat clean from the shell, the perfect amount of bacon to add some smoke and salt to the dish without taking away from the lobster. Perfectly al dente pasta in a cream and herb sauce and ya have one of the best pastas in the world.Guinea Fowl w/ Foie Gras - this was our meat entree. I was kind of hoping for duck or lamb, maybe venison or a steak even though my dining companion is not a big fan of steaks.  But I am thrilled we have this, nearly a whole bird with crisp skin and moist meat in a funky, slightly gamey and savory gravy sauce. With it came greens, frites, and mushrooms in brown butter. All of it with the gravy was fantastic. I get a bit blurrier after the champagne is finished, mix in a sherry with some cheeses and a cognac to go with their signature Mille Fuille and a vanilla/blood orange sorbet, and you have an unforgettable meal. To top it off, service was incredible and made me feel cared for and special. I don't like to claim anything is ""the absolute best"", but I have yet to have a dining experience that could possibly eclipse my meal at Joe Beef.If you can get a reservation here, you absolutely must go. I beg you."

This was the only restaurant I really wanted to try in Montreal and my friend Sarah and I luckily got 2 seats at the bar due to a cancellation. The food was exceptional and the guys who work at the bar are super friendly. We got the uni shot starter ($5 Canadian), the lobster spaghetti ($35 Canadian), the ""minute"" aka skirt steak ($28 Canadian), and the corn cake with strawberries and creme fraiche for dessert. Everything was delicious. The lobster spaghetti is a no brainer. I don't especially like cream based pastas but wow, the flavor was amazing and lobster was really fresh. The portion was on the smaller side. Sarah and I shared but I think we could've easily ordered our own :) The minute steak comes medium rare but actually came out more as rare. If you don't like rare meat, you should ask them to cook to medium. Even though skirt steak is sometimes tough and not as flavorful, Joe Beef executes well and I really loved this dish. The corn cake dessert was really good. It's basically corn bread and perfect if you don't like dessert too sweet. It was just sweet enough to close out our perfect dinner. Total bill was under $120 Canadian including tax and tip."
/user_details?userid=KMMyrKc269Ar5aCdG_eMHQ,James S.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Quite honestly the most overrated place I've been to. We were lucky and had a reservation for 4 people. For the amount you pay and the taste of the food, I don't get the hype about this place. I know my review will probably be over looked and lost in the sea of Yelpers over the top reviews, but it's a place you try once and never go back. Just to see what all the hype is about. At the end the cost was $160 per person. If you're looking to save on some money, stay away from the wine. It seems like they are gouging. I'm no wine expert, but when your wine list starts at $80, it's fishy to me. The menu is very hard to read (not just because it was in french, but on a chalkboard on one side of the room with little lighting). Luckily the waiter was patient with us( I guess he's used to tourists coming in and asking the same questions). Very patient and helpful for sure. The best was the creamy frois grois that was added to our smoked duck. I still have dreams about it. THAT GOOD. The trout was pretty good too. All the other dishes were pretty good but not what you would expect with this hype and price. He wanted us to try the steak there but we decided not to. It seemed like the popular choice, but since we were going to have steak the next day we decided not to. Maybe try it out and see how it is. He also said the lobster spaghetti and oysters were popular. Overall, 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down on it. Best advice, take a picture of the menu. Helps so much.

I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy."

We of course started with two caesars. Joe Beef is famous for their caesars. They were very good. I'm pretty sure they put horseradish in them which is key. Then we started with a plate of oysters. They had a choice between a few different kinds of oysters so we tried both the pacific and the Boston. It was the first opportunity I've ever had to try pacific oysters and I really liked them. They are softer than PEI oysters and taste a little sweeter. We then shared the smoked trout with pickled vegetables and potato cakes. The waitress informed us that Joe Beef has it's own smoker outside which we thought was pretty neat. When it arrived, the waitress asked if we wanted it deboned, and proceeded to debone it in front of us. Not sure if it was suppose to be a form of entertainment or not. I would have preferred if it just came already deboned. For the main meal Shannon had the lobster pasta dish and I had some cod in a white cream sauce. Following that, I had the desert which was a layered chocolate cake with some white cream on top. It was really decadent and rich. Probably my favourite part of the meal. We both thought our meals were up to par for a fancy restaurant standard. However, neither of us was blown away by the food either... given the price. Plus, I think their focus is probably on meat dishes and I don't eat meat."

The other four people ordered the 18 ounce steak. All four people did not like the taste of the steak, the way it was seasoned and the quality. The steaks were mainly uneaten. The waitress asked if we wanted the steaks wrapped up - we said no we didn't like the steaks. She did nothing, did not offer anything else or call a manager. The wine was the best thing that was consumed that evening by 4 of the 6 people. The bill was presented and there was nothing taken off the bill despite 4 uneaten meals. Not impressed. Overrated.

You may be thinking to yourself, but ""2013 is not over, how do you know that it was your best meal of the year?"".  Trust me, I know. While this was our second visit to Joe Beef on our recent trip to Montreal, to me it really was the whole culmination of our week long stay there.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was the wife's birthday and we were there with great friends.  The only drawback was that the outside patio area was not available on this warm May day in Montreal.  For all we know, it could have been too hot out there for dinner anyway and we may have lucked out.  Next time the patio will be ours. We did, at least have our same fabulous waitress, Morgane.The menu had changed somewhat since 2 days prior and there were some good additions that were calling my name.  The oeuf en gelee were an immediate choice for my appetizer and the sweetbreads were a slam dunk for my entree.  It's like they knew what I wanted to eat and they made it happen. I can't really vouch for their psychic abilities at Joe Beef, but they nailed this meal for me.  Also, from now on I am getting the bloody mary as my drink since it comes with its own appetizer of raw oyster and crab leg or some other shellfish.We also ordered the conch fritters for the table, which were a nice surprise. I think that the only other time I had conch was in Key West a long time ago. The others ordered halibut, fois gras double down and another whole fish dish that the name escapes me now. After polishing all that food, dessert seemed again from psychic intervention to be appropriate for the group, Charlotte aux fraise.  Morgane recommended that we order 2 for the table.  We should have probably listened to her.  We also opted for the trio of mini eclairs.  The Charlotte came out with sparklers for the wife's birthday.  Once the sparklers were out, it did not last long.  The eclairs were also tasty.  Morgane was nice enough share some calvados, as a digestif with us, before we left to finish off the meal of the year.Next time the patio in the back will be ours!"

If you are looking to land a table with a party of two or larger, it could be a little harder to get a spot in the restaurant. I called in around 5 PM and had a confirmation for 9:15.I had a very pleasant experience, and ordered most of the mainstays. I have some dietary restrictions (no pork, no alcohol), and I was blown away by the staff's attention to my dietary restrictions. My past experience has been most fancy restaurants can only make food in a certain way and don't really allow for any customizations. The people at Joe Beef were not only okay with customizations but would openly warn me if any of the menu items had anything that doesn't comply with my needs.I ordered a delicious asparagus dish that was doused in a white sauce that wasn't too creamy. I also had the beef tartare and half of the lobster spaghetti (without the bacon). For dessert, I had the marjorolie (sp?) slice. The lobster spaghetti was phenomenal, and the food presentation was exquisite. Beautiful dishes.I also want to tip my cap to Gabriel, who was working behind the bar that night. Since I don't speak French, Gabriel deftly helped me through the menu last night. The first asparagus dish they sent out had ham in it, and he was very apologetic about sending it out. They quickly remedied it by sending out a dish without the ham -- I was very pleased with the level of service.The only reason I docked a star was the length of time. I sat down at 9:15, and probably ordered by 9:25. I received my first dish by 10:15 (mind you the first dish had ham, so I had to return it), and was out of the restaurant by 11:15. I thought it could be a little faster."

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"More in the blog:The Why:  Along with Au Pied du Cochon, David McMillan and Frédéric Morin's 75-seat bastion of heavy locally sourced gluttony was at the top of my ""to-dine"" list when making my first visit to Montreal.  Having garnered national attention after a visit from David Chang and subsequently releasing a cookbook appropriately titled ""Art of Living According to Joe Beef"" I knew it would be my kind of place - I just hoped the chalkboard menu could appease the picky palates of my mother and aunt.The Space:  It's a bar - it is tight, it is cramped, it is full of odds n' ends, nick-nacks, trinkets, and even the bathroom is used for storage space.  Apparently only originally 35 seats and subsequently expanded to 70 the stools/chairs are hard and they seat you where they can - in our case at a ""3-top"" booth in the window.  Really, it's pretty awesome, but when it is full it is Loud with a capital L.The Service:  Is ""hipster formal"" a service style?  It is now.  Much like the folks at Publican in Chicago or the Chang spots in New York these waiters, decked out in plaid and 5 o'clock shadow know the menu, the preparations, and the chef's vision without hesitation.  Recommendations flow freely, cautionary tales of ""ordering too much"" are given (and ignored,) and although his accent was thick our server's English was flawless - a must on the all-French Chalkboard menu.  Cornflake Eel Nuggets with BBQ, Mustard, Tartar:  As anticipated, my aunt had a lot of difficulty with the appetizer portion of menu but wanting to make sure we experienced the best of what Joe Beef had to offer I took the liberty of ordering the first round for the table; three items with this as the centerpiece.  Served as a half-dozen, intense and creamy with that unctuous undertone that few things save for eel can offer, this should definitely be a must order for anyone making the visit.  Sweet without being sweetened, fatty without being 'greasy', and particularly excellent with the barbeque sauce - with the ladies unwilling to try I gladly ate all six.Parfait de Foie Gras, Cherry Brioche, Truffles:  3.5 ounces of creamy duck liver whipped with black truffles served beneath a piping hot piece of buttery brioche loaded with maraschino cherries; it was every bit as good as it sounds and although I had to wait for a second piece of brioche I was glad to do so.  Like most things at Joe Beef this was probably best shared-but it wasn't.Foie Gras Double Down:  The second half of my main course was probably Joe Beef's most famous item and clearly poking fun at KFC's abomination of a sandwich Joe Beef takes the concept to a whole different level by replacing chicken with two thick slices of duck foie gras that are butermilk brined and breaded prior to a trip to the deep-fryer and wrapping them around aged cheddar and sliced bacon.  Loosely wrapped in aluminum foil and drizzled with pure maple syrup, sriracha, plus a bit of garlic and Old Bay infused mayonnaise the sandwich was much like everything else at Joe Beef, brash and unapologetic but at the same time nuanced and subtly sophisticated.Lobster Spaghetti:  The recipe goes a little something like this - A 1.25 lb. lobster, 0.25 lb. house made spaghetti, 2 slices diced bacon, 3 Tbsp Brandy, 0.25 cup peas, 0.25 cup 35% cream, 0.25 cup half-and-half cream, salt, pepper, chopped chives.  The pasta is al dente, the lobster is snappy and sweet, and the sauce is the very definition of decadence - at $49 it is the most expensive item on the menu, but apparently also the most ordered...and for good reason.Pistachio Financier - Maple Ice Cream:  I was told by a friend that while APdC's desserts are 'hit and miss' I should definitely save room for those at Joe Beef. Beginning first with one of the two 'larger' desserts my photos really don't do justice to how big this cake was, but at nearly eight inches in diameter and probably a half inch thick it was great - a thick sponge with great tooth already saturated with butter and almond paste but eager to soak up the creamy maple syrup and ice cream while pistachio granola added more texture.  Always happy to overindulge in desserts this was exactly my 'style' - a standout of the trip.The Verdict:  The place is loud, audacious, and cramped while the food is equally brazen and uncompromised but with servers that love their job and chefs who know the basics well enough to nail them yet also  know themselves well enough to take chances there is a whole lot to love about Joe Beef.  While some may say it is derivative of APdC I personally couldn't imaging visiting Montreal again without dining at both because although the cuisine shares some similarity each is an entirely unique experience - Picard's space a self-proclaimed ""bastion of excess"" while McMillan and Morin's restaurant puts less emphasis on the audacity of each dish and more on experiencing their ""Art of Living"" inclusive of food, service, and setting."

I would give the entree 3.5/5The main course, the half chicken is actually really nice, however, two waiters came to us with the joking kinda tone ""request"" us to use the sauce came with the chicken, which was slightly uncomfortable when a waiter said ""I don't feel like you use enough sauce"" maybe he was trying to be funny but it was not cuz the sauce tasted very much mustarded and for me it feels like too much sesame paste in it, I don't think they really put sesame but just so you know how it taste like, it is very thick. The lobster was a disappointment. It seems like the lobster has a very high reputation about how awesome it is. I am not a cream person, so for me the whole thing is way to creamy, too heavy. I didn't even finish it. And honestly, lobster... The kind of food, even when you just steam it at home, it tastes delicious. I didn't taste any extra effort or the top 100 restro flavour within it. So if you love cream, you will love the course I assume. If you don't, then don't order it. So the main course 3/5The dessert, the petite fruit thing is way toooo sweat. The ice cream is good but it is enough for two. So don't order one just for yourself lol it will be toooo much.  So dessert, 4/5As for the service, doesn't match their title as the best restaurant in Canada. In between the main course and dessert, they kept us waited for 10-15 mins meanwhile only 4 tables are occupied. And the way they pushed you to use the sauce which I think they are very proud of is very unpleasant. And somehow we both think the waiters there are a bit over themselves as they crowned themselves as the best. And one more thing, which annoys me a lot is that we didn't finish the half chicken, so we asked to take out. And surprisingly, then I open the box back home, they just dumped the whole plate into the box including the finished chicken bones. Lol that is very low standard as take out packaging. So in terms of service, based on what we paid for, 1.5/5 So overall I gave 3/5, and final words, yes indeed, it is ranked as the best in Canada and top 100 in the world, however based on my experience plus the reservation waiting time (3 mouths), I would say, there are so many other places to try in Montreal and you will have more pleasant experience."

I brought 3 restaurant-savvy New Yorkers with me for this food journey and they were blown away with how much Joe Beef rocks.It was pouring buckets outside and the restaurant was warm, cozy and totally hopping when we arrived for our 7pm reservation. After standing there and trying to pick from all of the choices on the chalkboard, I finally hung my head and begged the server for her help. She laughed and then started listing her favourites. We ordered them all, everything from the duck, to the terrine to 3 types of fish. Every bite was incredible, tasty and knee-weakening delicious. The wine my dinner partner picked was perfect with all of our dishes, so good, that we ordered a second bottle.The ambiance of this place is just plain awesome and I adore the buffalo in the washroom, he just makes me happy!

Rabbit was overcooked.  Better duck in chinatown back home.  Spaghetti with lobster a winner.  The menu is too ambitious for this gastro pub to execute.  Good wine list. I skipped dessert. I can forgive inconsistent food if the hospitality is there.  Joe Beef is a gastro pub masquerading as a full service restaurant.I have read this is part of the restaurant credo.  Take it or leave it.  And some customers enjoy being treated like their patronage doesn't matter.  Good for them and good for you.  This restaurant is review proof and people will continue to fill the seats.But you know what happened at Au Pied du Cochon, Salmigondis, Le Fantome, Magpie and even Trou de Beigne, a donut shop? HospitalityI received better treatment at Tim Horton's.Forget that in my party were various industry people who have traveled and dined all over the globe.  Forget that we were there to have a good time.  This isn't about a spoiled American always getting his way.  I know how hard it is to accommodate requests.  But I try.  I put in the effort. At some point during the evening I make something happen.  We didn't need a dessert comp or an extra dish.  We just wanted plain old fashioned hospitality.People visit my restaurant and often ask me for recommendations for NYC and other cities I have visited.  Top of the list as one of the worst dining experiences of my life.Good luck to you Joe Beef.  Make all the money in the world treating your customers like they don't really matter.Buyer Beware."

Not overly vinegery.  Dessert was a concord grape pie.  I am a pie baker, so the filling was deliciously tart and tasty, but the crust was not a typical pie crust, and it was okay.  I also can't say enough about the service.  I asked our server to recommend a glass of wine to go with my steak, I actually assumed it would be a syrah or rhone varietal, but he brought me a fabulous Italian blend of Sangiovese and Montepluciano, a San Lorenzo that was soooo good.  I'd go back in a hot second."

We sat next to a wonderful couple and ended up eating, drinking, and laughing the night away with them. We had the most amazing night and Alexandra was a big part of it (girl deserves a raise!). We were never rushed and the staff work and flow like a family together. In the end, a kind young server called us a cab and told us where the driver should turn so we were not on a wild goose chase as tourists in from NY.

My only issue with the whole experience is that it took a while for food to arrive, but their giant Caesar's more than made up for that.  God speed Joe Beef - I'll be back soon... after going on a diet."

There was no way it was living up to expectations. I was preparing myself for a letdown. But in the end, I've never had a better overall dining experience. From food, to ambiance, to service, I've never felt more satisfied satisfied leaving a restaurant. If you can only eat at one restaurant in Montreal, try to make it Joe Beef. I could eat there every weekend, and I don't think the experience would ever grow old.We were seated in a corner table by the window and next to the bar, protected from some of the restaurant noise and bustle. I think it must be the best seat in the house, and if you're eating in a party of two or three, I'd do your best to reserve it.Our waitress, Alex, started off perfectly, offering to guide us through the entire meal. We put down our menus, and Alex surprised us with everything (we selected the category of drink we would be having, and told her we needed the lobster spaghetti). I'd recommend this style as well - if you're at Joe Beef, sit back, accept that you are going to spend a bunch of money, and enjoy the ride. Alex was the best server I've ever had. She made great selections, picked on us, made recommendations for other restaurants, and gave us her email for any returns to the city.Three hours later (I should quickly mention that you don't go to Joe Beef for a quick meal - food service was slow, but our servers were always attentive), we were full on a perfect meal and drunk off fantastic cocktails. For appetizers we had montreal smoked meat croquettes (a must) and a clam salad (decent - more of a palate cleanser). For entrees, the horse steak (perfectly prepared, fantastic sauce, definitely worth ordering if you've never had horse), the lobster spaghetti (read other reviews, this lives up to the hype), and pork schnitzel (I was betrayed by my first bite, which thought it was a run of a mill schnitzel. The flavors are complex, and this is also definitely worth ordering).For dessert, a classic French cake (forgetting the name) that I loved but my dining companions found mediocre. My review is the correct one - I don't love cake but loved this cake, and that's saying a lot.Throughout the meal, we enjoyed a wine selected by Alex, and some of the best cocktails I've ever had. We also were given two rounds of free drinks - one a celebratory shot shared with the kitchen staff, another a ""just because"" drink. Come here, enjoy one of the best restaurant experiences you'll ever have. But do so fully prepared to let go, to spend money (we dropped $175 pp, but also drank quite a bit), and to eat a lot."

It was fantastic.The service is was excellent. We had Alexandria as our waitress. She essentially ordered everything for us as the menu was entirely in French. Alexandria was so knowledgable that it was hard not to trust her -- I'm so glad we did. She did an excellent job. The restaurant itself was simple and beautifully lit.  I am usually dubbed as a pretty cheap person but when our check came in I was shocked. I almost wanted to give them more money for the meal. And I'm not saying that it was cheap either.

Don't speak French? No problem here. Came with wife and we split everything. - bison tartare - classic preparation with an egg on top. liked the gaminess of the bison. - broccoli -gigantic stock of broccoli from the garden in the back. some type of sauce and parmesan cheese on top added to it. - foie gras double down - ordered a half at $17 because I knew I'd have to eat basically all of it. I wasn't expecting much since I thought it was just a playful immitation. This thing was insane. Best foie dish I've had since the foie biscuit and gravy at Animal which obviously isn't on the menu anymore. - lobster spaghetti - i know at $55 per portion its a little steep.....but I think I'd order it again if we went. big portion, insanely rich. they don't skimp on the lobster. - only let down was a homemade maple donut which was served cold (on purpose but seemed weird), and drenched in a soupy sauce. Could have skipped this one. All of the above  + two bloody ceasars (served with two small shrimp stuffed with caviar and an oyster, holy shit) + a house made beer + two shots of fernet came to $206 after tax.

/user_details?userid=b_AKFExSmK0krtuzquroMw,Daniel D.,"Littleton, MA",2 star rating,"Updated Review:  I have taken some time to step away after my experience and give what I feel is an honest, critical, and logical review.  I am trying to approach this from a logical perspective and remove any brash and quick emotional response.Joe Beef... an establishment that is beyond well regarded and coveted by many who enjoy unique dining experiences.  Unfortunately, the experience fell short for me.  It may have been the hype from friends, the consistent and raving reviews from well respected critics, and perhaps just the level of anticipation that left me looking for more.We spent a week in Montreal and made the rounds to the cities must do spots.  I'll be frank, my French is beyond poor and I usually outwardly express my lack of the language.  For 6 nights we didn't face a single issue, we were met with respect and were offered either English menus or someone well versed in the English language.Service is important and Joe Beef fell short.  Our waiter, a tall bald gentleman (with forearm tattoos) fell short.  He was quick, disingenuous and it appeared he was bothered we did not speak French.  The menu and wine list was not covered, it received a quick ""check it out and ask if you have any questions"".  This is direct contradiction to the couple sitting at the bar, English speaking Americans who received a thorough and spirited review of the menu by the bartender.  I should have spoke up and asked for a new waiter, that is my fault.  I know that these things happen, the place can't be perfect all the time.  I'm just disappointed it came on the last night of our stay after a week of nothing but perfect service.We made a wine selection from the available wines by glass, no complaints and a nice glass.  The oysters were wonderful, a nice selection of West Coast and PEI varieties.  Our entrees fell short.  My wife had the leg of lamb.  Overall she enjoyed the dish but it lacked some depth as a dish.  A slab of meat with simple peas was not what we expected but it was still a decent dish.  I choose the Lobster and Spaghetti, which is regarded as a classic amongst many reviewers.  Unfortunately I found myself wanting more in the dish.  The lobster was cooked perfectly as was the pasta but the sauce itself was rather simple and boring.  I had read in the past this dish was served with a delicate lobster bisque sauce, perhaps they changed this up.  It lacked depth, flavor, and added very little to the dish.  As a New England-er I eagerly awaited this dish, I wanted to see how a new city would handle a classic meal from my home.  As a dish it was certainly edible but I would never order it again, especially at the price of 50 CAD.  Update:  I received a voice mail from the manager of Joe Beef regarding my experience and poor review here on Yelp.  I appreciate them reaching out.  I've yet to decide if I will speak to them regarding the matter.  Unfortunately I am 5 hours from Montreal and that would be quite the trip to give it another go.  If I find myself in Montreal again I'll certainly be coming to Joe Beef again I'll just make sure to have a waitstaff member who delivers what they are supposed to do."
/user_details?userid=pEMWzZ8qWY1T_K0HUoKDIA,Hope C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"After anticipating the meal at Joe Beef for nearly two months, it's my fault that this mecca couldn't live up to my mammoth expectations. A good meal is much more than just good food. It's the feeling you get the moment you walk into a kitchen or a dining room. It's perusing the menu, catching whiffs from the kitchen, pleasant conversation, delectable alcohol, dim lighting, a comfortable background din (or good music), anticipating the courses - a moment of suspension in time. A good dining experience cocoons you in the moment, in the here and now, taking you away from the routine of everyday life. The end result in this case is that Joe Beef could very well have been a great restaurant, and a great meal, to many people, but to us on that Friday night in April, it was not.Our reservation was for 7pm and it was still bright outside. The dining room was tiny, a few large tables and several 2-tops crammed about one inch apart --the whole table had to be physically moved out and turned sideways for the person against the wall to sit down. Being crammed into a small area when it's still bright outside is uncomfortable. Once the sun has set, this feeling might not be so grating. The chalkboard menu was also very irritating. It was so large and obtrusive in an attempt to be unpretentious that, erm, it was pretentious. So you have a menu that changes frequently, we get it. Forcing people to stand crouched over in front of an overpriced blackboard after making reservations for months in advance is pretty obnoxious. See the contradictions here?I wanted to order the truckstop piglet, but the waitress (granted, very pretty and seemingly well-intentioned), told me not to order this because it wouldn't be enough to share. Instead she steered us towards the rabbit dish, which in retrospect I don't know how I let her do, because I much prefer pork to rabbit and I'd just had rabbit in Quebec City. But it was one of those panicked moments where I wanted to please HER and thought I'd just put my trust in her hands and let her lead me down this culinary road.We started with raw oysters which were good, but not ""spectacular."" The next course was the foie gras double down - two pieces of foie gras battered, deep fried and placed together with a strip of melted cheese, bacon and maple syrup drizzle in between. It was a little morsel from heaven. This was the best course for sure, but there was only enough for 1.5 bites each (got the half order). The rabbit course was fine - two rabbit legs that were not particularly tender or off-the-bone or generous in size, covered with a mushroom cream sauce that was very tasty. There were a few mushrooms in the bowl and some dandelion greens, but not much else. I felt my heart drop when I saw the truckstop piglet (a beautiful rectangle of smoked pork covered with a crunchy piece of skin) presented to the man sitting next to me. His partner got the schnitzel, and a generous portion of that, may I add.The meal left us unsatisfied, and given the crammed quarters, inability to hear each other, awkward chalkboard menu, inadvertent misguidance of the server and the ""trying too hard to be hip and humble"" snobbery of the place, paying nearly $170 for a good but not GREAT meal was disappointing. I like loud, frenetic bistros with chalk menus and adventurous food and good wine, but this place felt...forced.Joe Beef: a little like the emperor's new clothes. Try it and decide for yourself!"

It was a good start, very good terrine called jambon persillé. This is it, that's the only positive thing I can say about the restaurant. The main course was chewy and overcooked.

Was super last minute but was able to land a reservation a week in advance by calling in. You may have to try a few times for someone to pick up but it's just because they are that busy. Once we got in there we were blown away by the service and food. It was a dim lit place, perfect for dates and fine dining. Our server was amazing and suggested everything we should get. We started with three different oysters as a starter then moved into the lobster pasta and rabbit for mains. Washed it down with some red wine. Amazing. Worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Of course in Montreal, you must come to Joe Beef. It's no frills, but deeply romantic and dimly lit.  It's hard to get a ressie here so plan ahead.  My hubby and I came here at 9pm on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy actually.   Our server was excellent - they don't have a menu per se, well they do but it's on a dimly chalkboard and in french so we had to lean on our server a lot for help. Not only did he run through a text book of dishes and preparation by memory, but he in fact chose our dinner for us. Considering their portions are quite large, they can modify different portion sizes to optimize your meal. We let our server run wild and we had: - delicious artichokes and goat cheese, spread like a tapenade atop toast - zucchini flowers fried with sturgeon, delicious and unique. A bit salty? Still tasted light with a good aioli. - braised rabbit (very tender like chicken) with delicious eggplant that was perfectly stewed and in such a flavorful tomato sauce - perhaps my favorite course. A half portion of the lobster spaghetti - creamy lobster bisque sauce with bacon and deliciously tender lobster claw and tail. So so so good- the main course was the lamb neck which was prepared in so many different ways: as a chop, thick slab of bacon, and stewed tender. I don't love lamb but this was a unique preparation; my husband loved it.  It definitely has That strong lambFlavor though; great for lamb lovers. It was good, lamb is just not my fave. But to our server's point - it's much easier to get s good steak or beef and harder to get lamb.  He was so great, madeSuch good choices for us. Hubby had the house beer, a non weak Pinot noir, and I some fuller bodied French wine.   We shared the classic hazelnut cake which was so nutty and delicious with a chocolate ganache.  Tender and moist. Yummy with our cappuccino. Best place we ate at in Montreal; worth the hype."

I ordered the horse filet with sausage, I might be rating this 5 stars just because the fact this was my first time trying horse, or because its one of the few places I could find that actually prepare it in a restaurant. But this might be one of the best ""different"" types of meats I have tried and everything on the plate was outta this world. This also had a great crowd, atmosphere, and the price was reasonable. I highly recommend trying this place to locals and anyone passing through, its worth it."

For the main course we went for the classic lobster spaghetti (did not live up to the hype but still excellent) and finally the best dish of the night: ""pork happiness"" with a pork belly wrap-around with a side of bone marrow and escargot.

The menu is all written on a chalkboard. That's it. Don't forget your glasses at home. But if you do, the waiters are all so knowledgeable. But the portions are HUGE. no really, they are HUGE. Two of us, ordered a half portion of the lobster spaghetti as an app since we wanted to do the lamb for two. Just to let you know, the half portion comes with 1.5lbs of lobster. After just splitting the half portion, hubby and I were so full. But we thought okay, just some protein is coming. How big could it be, since we're thinking of NYC or LA portions. UMMMM The lamb for tow is really for like 4-6 ppl or two men, who've smoke a big ol fat doobie and want to EAT! The lamb comes with couscous, potatoes, and a harissa/yogurt sauce. We barely made a dent in it and felt so sad because we coudln't take it home as we were visiting. Suffice to say, two homeless folks had a great meal that night. The sister restaurtants, which are literally next door to each other are all quaint and offer the infamous lobster spaghetti as well. Everything was fabulous, but that Lobster Spaghetti is worth the hype. Like, I can't wait to go back to Montreal just for the spaghetti. (and Boustan)"

The friendly bartender read us the entire menu, sharing recommendations as he went.  We ordered:The freshest oysters I have ever tastedTwo appetizers - the famous foie gras double down (half order), a menu staple consisting of two fried pieces of foie gras with bacon and maple syrup sandwiched between; and a shredded turkey leg concoction that was reshaped around a bone to look like a drumstick.I could have stopped here and been satisfied. The foie gras was out of this world. Life changing. I am so lucky that I do not live in Montreal, I would turn into a foie gras double downFor entrees, I had veal scaloppini and Jamie had the half hen.

Both here and next door (Liverpool House) are in a special category - no matter how high your expectations, you can still be impressed with what you get. In our case, we had been planning to go to Joe Beef for two years, and finally go around to it just weeks before leaving town for good.We started with some drinks: I had a (good) negroni, and my girlfriend had the house Caesar. She said she wasn't blown away by her drink (even though it came with a shrimp and an oyster!), but I mine was quite good (and I'm a total negroni connoisseur aka. snob). If the only negative thing you can say about a drink is ""it didn't blow me away"", then it's no that bad of a drink...My starter was a no-brainer: foie gras double-down. I had heard of it, but needed to eat it for myself. It's over-the-top, decadent, in-your-face ridiculous, and utterly fantastic. I probably can only do one every few years, but will be back for another them moment my coronary tract has cleared.For our mains, the birthday girl had the cheval (horse) steak, and I had the rabbit. My rabbit was very good, but the winner was definitely the horse. It was cooked perfectly - as good as any steak I've had - and was a really generous portion. There was more than enough for my girlfriend (for her main) and for me to have a big slice too - something that almost never happens when the quality is as good as it was.I don't recall what we had for dessert - I think the double-down was crossing the blood-brain barrier by this point, but there was really nothing to fault about our experience at Joe Beef, even though it was probably the highest expectations I've had for any meal in my life."

/user_details?userid=REXsFXjXfh8MlwwtJxnFEQ,Chris D.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I've been holding on to my Joe Beef experience because humans, especially those with OCD, place an unreasonable amount of significance on round numbers. When I realized I was coming up on my 250th review, I figured I would save the honor for what I consider to be one of the top five dining experiences in my lifetime. Yeah, it was that good.First, special thanks to my friend Mike H. for pointing us in the direction of Joe Beef. I was laser focused on eating at Au pied de cochon during our time in Montreal and prior to him enlightening me, had never heard of ole Joe. We ended up eating at both restaurants and in my (not so) humble opinion, Mr. Beef blows the other place out of the water.I have to admit that when we walked in to JB, everything about it was uncomfortable. The lights were dim, the music was loud and the small space was so chocked full of tables that you couldn't help but feel everyone was staring at you. This feeling was amplified by the fact that our waitress asked us to study the blackboard menu on the wall while they pulled our table out for us. The two things of note here are that there are no paper menus, so the person with their back to the board needed to decide before they sat, and the tables were so close the staff have to let you in and lock you down... like some sort of culinary roller coaster.Our food came from nearly every part of the animal kingdom. We had oysters. Great. We had foie gras. Fantastic. The wife had schnitzel. Good. I had a horse steak (yeah, horse... or is it naaay, horse?). Very Good. Everything was expertly prepared and presented in a ""Hey, we like food but we aren't all prissy about it"" sorta way. I don't like prissy. I liked this. The drinks were just as expertly prepared and equally as delicious. Putting a raw oyster on top of my Bloody Caesar? Uhhh, brilliant. (see pic)Truth be told, the food was not the highlight of the meal. Our waitress, Vanya, may very well be the best server we've ever had. Not only was she knowledgeable, efficient, witty, professional and everything else you look for in wait staff, she was quite simply... lovely. There was something about her warm and friendly way of interacting with you that made you feel like you were the Greatest Person to Have Ever Walked the Planet. I know what you're thinking, Chris is just a sucker for blondes and his enthrallment with Vanya was probably because he'd love any blonde that feeds him. That's not an entirely invalid perception, however my wife had pretty much the same opinion of Vanya... and she's not in to chicks... or so she says. Hmm, give me a minute. Where was I? Oh yes, Vanya. We loved her.Perhaps the most surprising thing about the restaurant, besides the buffalo in the bathroom, was just how homey it became by the end of the night. I can see how people wouldn't like the close quarters, but have a few cocktails and suddenly the tables around you are welcomed dinner companions. For what it's worth, I went from telling my wife ""I don't want to eat dinner with them"" to high-fiving one of the two guys eating next to us by the time we left. We didn't have to pop our collars. We already knew we were cool.I firmly believe Joe Beef is going places. They don't have a ton of reviews, but with some of the press they've been getting lately, I expect that number to explode. If others' experiences are anything like ours, they will be firmly rooted at 4.5 stars well into the triple digits. They deserve it."

The Lobster Spaghetti was a huge disapointment and way overpriced. Though it was not lobster season so that may excuse the poor meat texture but the pasta did not seem home made at all. We were charged for the bread. In summary I would say overpriced due to the hype and you can find much better restaurants at this budget."

It was so disappointing!!!  For a $90 steak, you'd hope it would be one of the best you've ever eaten.  I think if I microwaved a cheap steak at home it would replicate how tasteless and tough it was.  Unfortunately, we're not complainers and ate our few bites of each dish.  I told the server when she asked that the lobster spaghetti was divine, the trout good, but the steak was so disappointing.  She acted surprised and didn't offer to make things better.  Another thing that can be improved is making the menu written on the wall (that's the only menu) larger.  Its very difficult to see, esp. in a dim setting."

My girlfriend and I first discovered Joe Beef five years ago.   We were looking in antique shops along Notre Dame when we stumbled upon this tightly packed, hole in the wall restaurant.  The menu was on a chalkboard, the waiters were kind and casual and the food was beyond divine.  We ordered about 24 fresh, sweet, New Brunswick Oysters, My girlfriend ordered the Lobster Spaghetti, I got the 49 dollar cut of steak with a slab of Roquefort Blue cheese.  It was delicious, expensive and worth it.  The next year, it was just as good, the following, a little less so, and the same decline the subsequent year.  We skipped last year, because the owners were busy opening their new restaurant Liverpool House.We both wanted to bring my parents to Joe Beef this year, especially because we missed out the year before.  What a mistake. From the moment we arrived, I knew that Joe Beef had radically declined in the last two years.   Joe Beef had died, and his corpse was sitting in a barely air-conditioned room with new tables and terrible food. It was empty at 6:30pm, our appointed reservation time; we were lead from a cool room into a hot back room.  My mother complained about the heat, she is a fit woman whose age I will not betray in this review, but suffice to say, she's earned the right to not sit in 85-degree heat while dropping 50 bucks on entrées.We asked to be moved to a cooler area, they kindly obliged.  That was the last positive event of the night.Here are the lowlights:The waiter walked away from us in the middle of explaining the menu, he returned and hurried us to order, even though we hadn't fully understood the dishes available. After being rushed to order, we waited a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes for appetizers, and another 1 hour and 30 minutes for entrees.My appetizer was supposed to be play on a Mac and cheese terrine with a duck egg on it.  It looked and tasted like the Chef took spam and mixed Kraft Mac & Cheese into it, fried it and put a chicken egg on top.  I know duck egg flavor and it wasn't a duck egg.My mom's cold soup was luke warm.  The waiter fixed this, not by making a new soup, but by trying to put ice cubes in it and re-serving it.  This is a 20 dollar appetizer!My steak with Gorgonzola was dry, grey and rubbery.This was all happening as the waiter kept pretending that nothing was wrong, furiously refilling our waters like we were at a hot dog eating contest, and it's now 85 degrees in the once cool main room.Finally, everything was SALTY, SALTY SALTY.The waiter dropped the bill, NEARLY $400.00 with no discounts for the wait or bad service, plus an extraneous alcoholic beverage that nobody ordered. He apologized at the very end, once he was paid.  We left, united in our dismay at what had happened and knowing that we would never go again. My girlfriend and I knew that we just attended the wake of Joe Beef.  We had pits in our stomachs.Or maybe that was just their heinous Eel Nuggets eating at our stomach linings."
/user_details?userid=e889RYEsiP3FksNKYMbKSw,Flossie A.,"Astoria, NY",1 star rating,"If I could give no stars, I would.I need to preface this review by stating that I have been going to Joe Beef for the last half decade. I loved this restaurant. LOVED IT. My husband and I make a yearly trip from NYC to Montreal, and make it a point to go to Joe Beef. And every time we've gone, we've dropped a serious amount of cash on it--we actually save up to do so, because we love it that much.We went this year, having missed going last year because it was closed so the owners could open their new restaurant, and believe me when I say we lamented the loss all year long. This year we took my husband's parents for the first time, and were very excited to have them experience it.When I say this was the worst restaurant experience of my life, understand that it pains me to do so. And when I say that not only was the initial experience bad, but the follow up and subsequent experience trying to contact Joe Beef for an explanation was worse, please understand what an incredible disappointment that was. When you're a loyal customer who has actually sent friends and family over the border to spend money at a restaurant, has purchased your cookbooks to give to people, and is in general one of the people who has helped you, with dollars and loyalty, get where you are, and you're completely disregarded, there is nothing more shameful or sad. And I say this now, again: you should be ashamed, owners of Joe Beef. And for all those who have had good experiences there, please understand, the second you have a TERRIBLE experience, you'll find yourself on the same side of the fence I'm currently on, and realize that these restauranteurs care about nothing more than your dollars.The experience, to sum it up as quickly as possible: the oysters were wonderful, but they're always wonderful. I found it odd that they've abandoned serving the oyster sauces in metal cups, instead opting for those strange disposable paper cups you get medicine in at the hospital, but whatever. My fault for ignoring warning signs of lower quality. After the oysters, it was all terrible.We waited over an hour for our appetizers. My husband got some kind of spam-like thing with macaroni in it that was oversalted and made me ill to even try, and both my FIL and MIL got a cold soup. Both of their soups came out luke warm. It being a 90+ degree day, and the fact that the AC was barely working in the restaurant, my MIL sent it back and told the waiter it was fine, she would go straight to her main course. We had already waited over an hour for apps, so we didnt want to risk pushing the mains out further by waiting for another soup, and besides, she said it was way too salty for her to eat. The waiter came straight back with the soup, and to cool it down, what had he done? He put ICE CUBES in it. We immediately sent it back.We waited another hour plus for our main course. At this point, we should have left. My favorite dish, the lobster pasta, was missing every ingredient but the lobster, cream, and pasta; my husband's steak was overcooked; my MILs duck was chewy and the sides that came with it, too salty to eat. We barely ate our meal. The bill came (approx $400) and there was an extra alcoholic beverage thrown on there, I guess to push some salt in the wound. Nothing was comped, no apologies, just thanks for your money.THE WORST PART: Husband and I left completely defeated and dejected. It felt like someone had died; it felt like a loss. Our favorite restaurant in Montreal was gone. I went on the Joe Beef facebook page to leave a comment, which was neither nasty nor cruel, and within 10 minutes, the comment was gone: no response, no nothing. Just deleted. I took screenshots of course, and posted something again, screenshots of the original comment included. Again, deleted. No comment. The least they could do was respond to me--even a ""We're so sorry for your experience"" blah blah blah would have been honorable and nice, but no. Nothing. So I posted a screenshot of the last deleted comment, and commented again. I don't think I need to tell you how quickly it was deleted. And that I'm now blocked.To me this speaks to restauranteurs who don't care for their customers, don't stand by their food, and don't respect the people who pay their bills. I've never had an experience where a business has just deleted bad reviews and ignored their customers in such a way. I'm shocked and saddened by the immaturity and senselessness of it. If I were eating at McDonald's, whatever. But to drop almost half a grand on a meal and be completely ignored and disregarded? That isn't right; they should be ashamed. For all those with good experiences, I hope they continue, because I know what a good Joe Beef experience is like, and it is wonderful. But I hope for your sake that you don't ever have to go through what we went through, because Joe Beef has proven he won't care."
/user_details?userid=XNT58N4I4ReDOBZKwURtbw,Kristin E.,"Royal Oak, MI",5 star rating,"Anniversary Year number 3 was celebrated at Joe Beef. Oh how we have now set the bar high! For starters: Make reservations well in advance. Luckily I knew this going in, since the hubs does business in Montreal often. The service was great, the menu, all in French and written on a chalkboard...that part was...difficult. It didn't matter. The waitress asks us, ""Do you trust me?"" and my first instinct was to say ""No..."" but knowing the reputation of the place, I figured there wasn't too far we could stray before having something pretty mind blowing...so we agreed and so opened Pandora's Box of gluttony...For Starters: Oysters & Clams. All were absolutely delicious and I don't think I could pick a favorite, (or remember the names) if i tried. Shortly after came the onslaught of gluttony...next dish was Beef & Veal tongue with truffle shavings a parsley pesto and topped with watercress. I am not a fan of gamey tasting things and I fear that this dish definitely falls into that category. It was well masked by the parsley and the fresh watercress flavors, but overall, I just don't think tongue is my thing. Then, the waitress brought a truly punishing concoction: the double down fois gras. The Joe Beef chefs are being cheeky with this one. Do you remember KFC's ""sandwich"" where the ""bread"" was two pieces of fried chicken? yeah, well that's this dish...two pieces of fried fois gras sandwiched in the middle was aged cheddar and smoked bacon. It was PURE heaven / heart attack on a plate. For our main entrees, the waitress brought the Lobster Spaghetti & the New York Strip with sliced tomato and fresh horseradish. The Lobster Spaghetti landed in front of my face and I swear I could hear a choir of angels singing ""AHHHHH"" and that light came streaming from the heavens...goodness gracious...that plate was something to behold!!! The lobster meat was ever so generously mixed in the heavy creamy pasta. The flavors of the pasta were mild. Not in the sense that it was under-flavored...no quite the opposite...more in a sense that the person creating this dish understood the benefit of restraint. The flavors were luscious...velvetty...ever so rich but somehow not too heavy.  The lobster was so sweet & fresh and buttery. Thank you Frenchies for not being shy with your butter. My tastebuds will never be the same after this dish. It was a life changing dish. Every star of those 5 is well earned solely for this dish and this dish alone. I cannot think of a better way to spend 49 dollars or whatever the price was. It is WELL worth every penny and THEN SOME. The steak was plenty good, nicely cooked, all old school with it's tomato and horseradish. Ron Swanson would approve. But it's just a steak. If you need any further convincing on which to chose, GET THE LOBSTER SPAGHETTI. Just do it. I expect thank you gifts & songs of praise. ;-)No room for dessert. No way Jose. No need. I am drooling thinking of you, Lobster Spaghetti. You will go down in my list of most memorable culinary experiences to date!"

/user_details?userid=f1rLpdCaO641ZlIiuzc4mg,Jason L.,"Dallas, TX",2 star rating,"After listening to the hype and reading the reviews we decided to try Joe Beef on our last visit to Montreal. What a terrible disappointment. The place has charm and an ambiance that is genuine. However, there are some real deficiencies in the way the place is operated. When you walk in the door you'll be told to look at the giant chalkboard on the wall on the left hand side of the room. It is HUGE. And, written on it in very tiny letters is the menu. Entirely in French with no hints whatsoever. This is the only menu. In a packed restaurant you have no choice but to go back to the front, stand at someones table, literally, and try to quickly read the French menu. It's absurd. If you don't get lucky with an extremely patient English speaking waiter you are out of luck. The wine list is also on the board, and also French. Let's move on to the food. I don't know how to re-define the word ""heavy"" when it comes to food. Let's just say Joe Beef does a good of trying to do just that. The food was OK, but certainly not a top restaurant. It's a tourist attraction, and you should be prepared for exactly that rather than a dining experience. The ""Double Down"", their famous fried foie gras appetizer, was awful. It was so heavy it tainted the remainder of our meal. The buratta was good but far too involved with added elements and completely unnecessary ingredients. The beef was good, but it was not ""shout from the mountaintops"" good. It was a decent piece of meat, that's all. Desert was great; chocolate something or other.  Our fellow diners were a combination of rookie foodies and tourists; an unsophisticated crowd to say the least. It's the type of place you take an out of town guest so they can go home with a story. It's not the place for a fine dining experience. Though we had good service and a great bottle of wine, the $362 tab for the two of us felt like a total and complete scam. From my perspective, Anthony Bourdain damaged his reputation with his over the top recommendation of this place."

Spaghetti worth Lobster - mind blowing- Cowboy steak was kind meting- rabbit was amazing.. veal tartar was mouth watering and our selection of wines were awesome... it was $1200 for 6 of us and that is showing zero restraint.. it's a must if you love to indulge in hardcore Québécois cuisine.

We decided to order a few cocktails. They were very quick and before we got our cocktails our table was ready.Food & drinks: There was no printed menu for either drinks or food as far as we know! Menu & drinks are displayed on a black board in French. -Raw Bar we ordered oysters, scallops, and sea urchin. All the oyster were yumtastic and well cleaned. No grits here sir. Our favorite was from PEI called Colville. So good in fact we ordered more. Sea urchin was just OK. We like our sea urchin naked. Also east coast sea urchin has a very mild flavor so when they added apples and vinegar, you can barely taste the sea urchin. It's also very tiny it's not like west coast size. Scallops were fresh. The flavor was mild in comparison to larger raw scallops we've had. -Quail & End of Summer SaladI combined two appetizer to make a main dish. I would not recommend the quail. the sauce is like eating meat and vinegar. I love pickled things but this was not my cup of tea.The salad consisted of different leafy greens, shavings of squash and Parmesan. It served it's purpose for me which was to add some green to out meat fest. Other than that no particular recommendations about it. -Horse Steak (medium rare)What love ordered was delicious, very well prepared meat. The steak came wrapped in bacon with an egg on top. On the side was sausage and garlic fries. All delicious. I'm glad he kept on feeding me his meal. -DrinksPeople were having cocktails and a lot were having Manhattans and Moscow Mules. We jumped on the band wagon. Overall ok not a bad choice. Next we ordered bourbon cinnamon sour and a Robert Roy. I preferred the bourbon. Love had a Beaujolais that went very well with his meal. I had a Burgundy Aligote Chardonnay. Service:Man the service was slow at first we sat down around 9:45pm. I think we next saw our waitress at 10:30pm. We were all good with waiting because we're new yorkers we realize we're on a new york minute and try to be polite when we're traveling. We TRY! We couldn't wait any more because the waitress left us dry. Alcohol makes any wait easier so if it's going to be slow service at least give us that to do! It got much better when the waitress observed us to be annoyed and thirsty. She definitely made up for lost time which we appreciated. She also was very graceful about our mild tantrum which was also appreciated. Thanks Joe Beef we left well fed and a bit tipsy I must say. Mission accomplished!"

If you are one of those people that have to have the staple dishes, go ahead and have the lobster pasta and a steak. My recommendations: go with small side dishes, and a lot of them. Trust the staff, the are knowledgeable and with a little guidance they will create the culinary experience you came for. The wines and atmosphere are great as well. This is a well organized institution of quality food that is made with love. If you didn't made a prior reservation- no worries- just go to the younger sister restaurant next door- Le vin Papillon, they will take you in."
/user_details?userid=a4I9ZjzQc-PnNmbOJhMsAg,Dawn A.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Joe Beef is one of the restaurants my boyfriend and I made reservations at as soon as we decided to visit Montreal on vacation. We made our reservation approximately 8 weeks prior to our meal which is why I was surprised and disappointed when, after being ignored for several minutes upon our arrival, watching two parties who entered the restaurant after us being greeted and sat immediately, we were finally told we could be seated at what I consider the worst table in the place. We were seated at the table directly next to the door, in front of the menu that's written on a black board. Why would I consider this the worst table? Throughout our meal two different people stood in front of us using the flash on their camera to take pictures of the menu. And as the evening went on and more people arrived to find their table was not yet available they had nowhere to stand except for directly next to our table, hovering as we ate. My boyfriend couldn't even sit back in his chair without having someone's elbow bumping his head. Both of these things are very distracting and take a little something away from a romantic dinner.  I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant but I felt the crowd was very pretentious. We enjoyed our bottle of wine and I loved the Oysters that were served with horseradish, vinegar, cocktail sauce and lemon! We asked the waitress(who was so sweet and knowledgeable) to surprise us with two of her favorite appetizers. She brought us smoked salmon with cucumber which was okay and a ""crab chop"" that I enjoyed but wasn't anything special, not something I expected to get at Joe Beef. We chose the venison tart with foie gras as our main course, this is where we were truly disappointed. The tart had no flavor, we couldn't believe that something made with venison, foie, mushrooms, onions and sun-chokes could be so flavorless. I asked the waitress for salt thinking I could save the dish with some slaty flavor, but I was wrong, it was far too bland. We are the least pickiest eaters out there but we couldn't eat the meal we had eagerly looked forward to for months. We also had previously made reservations for Joe Beef's sister restaurant Liverpool for the following night, but we were so disappointed with our experience here that we cancelled the Liverpool reservation. The 3 stars are for our super nice server, overall ambiance and because I hate giving less than 4 stars :/"

Huge menu with varied options and killer wine list, mostly from Burgundy, my favorite. The raw bar was very impressive. Lots to choose from and all fresh. My wife and I split a dozen assorted oysters to start and they were very fresh and briny. I got the Porchetta seasoned ribs and they were fabulous, and a steal at $26 as it was a full rack. They were served with frites topped with finely milled brined Italian vegetables. My wife got the famous house lobster spaghetti and there was too little lobster and too much spaghetti, especially for $46. The downside was the service was slooow. We drank a bottle of wine while waiting about 40 minutes for our mains. Also, the music, which we loved, as so loud we had to yell at each other. All in all, I would still recommend it."

The menu is written on chalkboard and their wine menu is also written on a thin paper like notebook that is leather bound! Super original! Although everyone speaks English, the menu is mostly written in French, so having a bit of French food knowledge is definitely a plus. The food can be described as an explosion of flavored in your mouth! We started with 4 different varieties of oysters and  razor clams that were served with apple and foie gras shavings (combo totally works)! As main dishes we had the lobster salad and rump steak Reuben style (sorry don't remember the name). We were able to get a last minute reservations through our hotel so make a reservation in advance!

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"(*NOTE - From July 2012*) For the event of my convocation last month, I was provided with the choice of any restaurant in Montreal to celebrate. I didn't need to give it much thought - Joe Beef was the only choice for me.For the uninitiated, Joe Beef is currently considered probably the center of the Montreal food scene and has been receiving universal praise from many famous chefs worldwide. The geniuses behind this restaurant are Frederic Morin and David McMillan - two well known chefs here in the city. They opened this gem in the Little Burgundy neighborhood of the city which is now an up and coming area but wasn't at the time they first opened up. The restaurant has an amazingly cool but unpretentious vibe. We got lucky and had a reservation in the backyard surrounded by the garden where they grow their own vegetables and herbs. Nothing quite like seeing the cooks come pick items fresh to use in their dishes.Now for the meal... Decadent doesn't begin to describe it. Do not come here except a light meal. Everything is big, rich and meaty. The entree course provided us with fresh oysters from New Brunswick which were to die for. Nothing fancy but just perfect.The other element of the entree course was truly the star of the show. KFC has the double down sandwich so Joe Beef decided to crank it up a couple of notches and provides us with the Foie Gras Double Down. It is exactly what it sounds like and simply the greatest thing I have never eaten... 2 pieces of fried Foie Gras with house smoked bacon and aged cheddar in between. I cannot possibly convey the experience other than to say you MUST try this.. Just don't tell your doctor afterwards.The next course brought me Lobster sausage in a clam bake. Very good but after the previous course, it just didn't wow as much as I had hoped. Then again, I'm not sure how anything could really followed that double down. The one thing I forget to photograph was the side that came with this course - house fries tossed in garlic butter and Parmesan. That's right.... Garlic butter. They were as amazing as you think they would be.The dessert course was their version of a baked potato - made of chocolate covered hard meringue, ice cream, mint and candied fruits. Very creative and quite good as well.All in all, this was an amazing culinary experience that I will never forget. It is a pricy meal but worth every penny. If anyone asks me what is THE experience to try when in Montreal, Joe Beef is it. Cheers!"

Despite our sweat and misery, we had a legendary meal. But before a few words on the meal, a toast to the real star of the night: the bison in the men's room. What a guy.OK, the meal: We ordered off the blackboard menu. The tomato salad and cold soup were perfect amid the perspiration. The cocktails, Chilean red and Willamette Valley pinot kept us as cool as could be as a snap thunderstorm pierced the heat and humidity. Then, the beef, and lots of it.

My beef with Joe Beef is the way the menu was communicated to us. Menus are written on a board on the wall, common enough, but we could not see the menu from our table. When our (very nice) server came to our table to tell us about the menu she only told us about half of the menu... We told her that we preferred beef or other meat over fish and she really only told us about the meaty dishes on the menu. We had to inquire specifically about the vegetables and never got to some items we would have ordered had we known about them. On one hand I should've definitely  asked her to run through the entire menu, on the other hand should I really have had to ask if it was not in front of me?The menu is in French... I don't speak it but my girlfriend does though that wasn't really an issue - simply the menu should be easy for all to see or communicated in full to ensure that diners make the best choices for them."

I can see how that's fun but in that case, it might be a little pricy for the farm experience. Second, service is good but it left me with the impression that the emphasis was on the upsell and not on the dining experience. If you go, I recommend the  second service, that way, you'll stay longer and enjoy the evening. Wine selection is good but not all the waiters are apt at suggesting the right bottle. All in all, it's definitely worth the visit and it probably it would have earned at least another star if not for the price or the impersonal experience."
/user_details?userid=Ph36lxJlsF1kU3dn4qNFNA,Stephanie M.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious food and very friendly staff. The menu was a bit hard to read on the wall, so we opted to have the chef pick out a menu for us. I highly recommend doing this! He chose 3 appetizers and a main which was plenty of food, but not too much. The waiter also chose our wine for us (after we'd had our amazing Caesars first) which went perfectly with the whole meal. We'll be back in Montreal in August and will definitely be going again."

Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef."

/user_details?userid=yfAOQVaMB4MvuOc-4UkOqw,Brian H.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"The best food I've ever eaten. My wife and I shared the foie gras parfait entree (appetizer) and we ordered a 1/2 poulet (chicken) and jarret de boeuf (beef shank) for plats (main course)- all we're absolutely amazing. This was my first experience with foie gras and I now get the hype; this was like the Rolls Royce of liver pâté; a must try! Both mains were excellent as well but I must make mention of the portion sizes- inhumanly large. So large I would even argue that Joe Beef is in a way a value restaurant. At C$28.00 for the mains we ordered and considering the quality and portion size, Joe Beef is comparatively not as astronomically priced as its reputation; especially if, like us, you're American with the current exchange rate. The issue is that it is near impossible to finish the meal; my wife couldn't finish the shank and I would say I ate about 95% of the chicken before cutting myself off. I should've stopped sooner but it was seriously the best chicken I've ever eaten! While locals could certainly taken leftovers home, as tourists in a spartan value hotel we don't have a fridge to keep left over beef shanks in so that became a little inconvenient! For the  future we are wondering if you could share a plate... I feel like for two ordering two entrees and one plat to share would probably be a bit better as far as the amount of food goes.Service was overall good but I felt a bit of awkwardness in how casual or formal they were. On one hand the prices demand a certain class and formality but Joe Beef certainly has too much personally to be stuffy and the waiter made some welcomed jokes with us but at other times came off just a little bit aloof. The menu is a little intimidating for non French speakers but could certainly be worse. The waiter was also more than willing to answer questions and make honest recommendations; that is to say when I told him that I was in between two dishes he immediately answered and named the significantly less expensive choice- that concern for the customer's satisfaction over the potential for a bigger bill gets you big points in my book.This is definitely a must try if in Montreal. Just remember to book far in advance; I booked three weeks early and the best I could get was a Wednesday at 9:45 PM!!"

I know how ephemeral it must be for some but they clearly don't know the experience. Because Joe Beef is an experience. First you enter the room waiting to be seated like any other restaurant but you have to reserve your place to be sure to have one. It took us 2 months to be able to write this review! Anyway, then you have a dedicated waiter or waitress and they're not here just to take your order, they actually care about your choice and spend the time explaining which is which and for the wine lovers out there what goes with what. You don't feel like a simple customer and that's good in my book! Then the food. I took a half-duck with fries while my girlfriend took some spaghetti with lobster. A-MA-ZING! And it's not because it's expensive that you'll have less in your plate. Quite the opposite actually. We had a lot to eat and enjoyed it as much as we could. Believe it or not, I actually couldn't finish my meal! So I had some for the day after and it was still great! Now I understand why it gathered this reputation. That and the cozy atmosphere. Great place! Please make me rich so I can go back there more often!"

/user_details?userid=dU3BsVKMJcgQHPLZ1EM-dw,Heather M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Sat at the bar on a Sat night walked in without a reservation. We flew in from NYC that afternoon and wanted to try the best of the best in Montreal. It seemed the bartender was training a new guy. Immediately asked if we spoke French. We don't but I do understand French. I can't respond fluently but can comprehend the language well after studying the language a bit and touring France. So basically trainer began to guide the trainee in the ways of boosting the check average and pushing us along. Whatever totally normal for a restaurant to make money but pretty unprofessional. We ordered cocktails both of which were very sweet. Not the classic bitter balanced style I prefer. We ordered oysters and the halibut and cheval entree. The bartender recommended the summer salad. Oysters were what you would expect. The salad we could have done without. It was very boring. The cheval I thought was cooked perfectly but I would just order a steak next time. The halibut was AMAZING. I would have that twice. So good! We had a layered cake for dessert I can't remember the name but it was delicious. The wines were perfectly chilled and our glasses were never empty. OverallI loved the charm of the restaurant the rustic style and ambience. I would return and recommend to anyone wanting a great meal.
/user_details?userid=YrwXRcy355qBnbSdqoiYRA,Toujoursabd C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"My rating is actually somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.I recently visited Joe Beef on a Thursday night fresh off the train from Toronto. It was my first time there and I'd be very happy to go back to try them on another night.Joe Beef is a Montreal mainstay and came highly recommended to me by, well, pretty much everybody. While the wine list and menu prices are at the higher end of Montreal's very accessible dining scene, the coziness of the room and the casual friendliness of the staff help stave off that sometimes uncomfortable fine dining feel that should really only be encountered in 3-star Michelin temples of haute cuisine (and hopeful aspirants).(I say ""cozy"" but our table of three was perched in *almost* cramped quarters in the front window of the right-hand side room. I would have enjoyed slightly more space.)The menu and the wine list are written on chalkboards; the menu can be seen in both rooms, but unfortunately the same isn't true of the wine list. I think that the menu really fits into the vibe of the establishment; they didn't have to do the same to the wine list - which really oughtn't change so often that it really makes sense to leave it impermanently scrawled on slate, especially given its extensiveness). I really do appreciate the opportunity to look through a wine list on my own, even with Joe Beef's attentive and knowledgeable staff happy to recommend what turned out to be a delicious bottle.The food (the main event of the evening) is what actually disappointed (relative to my high high expectations). To start I had horse tartare, in this case  spread on toast and served with horseradish cream. Though there was nothing wrong with it, with the spicing on the tartare and the cream I didn't really have the opportunity to enjoy the main event (the meat), which was itself maybe overworked to the point that it wasn't necessarily recognizable as a former animal, either visually or on the palate. (This is perhaps what most diners prefer).For my main I had the Lievre Royale, which is basically a forcemeat of hare (and in this case rabbit, I think) wrapped around foie gras, which Joe Beef then tops with a small slab of foie as well. It's served hot with a jus made with blood, foie, and truffles, and puree potatoes on the side. A beautiful, rich, and mouth-watering dish in my mind, but the kitchen's preparation of the that night was overseasoned to the point of saltiness. I kept having to go to the (rapidly disappearing) potatoes for relief, and couldn't really taste the delicate flavors. I ended up leaving a third of the meat on the plate, which made me a little sad. This is supposed to be a rich dish by all means, and I don't mean that it was too rich. It was salty.For desserts, we had an over-the-top decadent pineapple concoction, and pistachio soft-serve on the side. Both were enjoyable and expressed the personality of the restaurant.The closest comparison I can draw to Joe Beef's attitude towards food and dining has to be Au Pied de Cochon in the same city. Both have no time for pretense and prefer to reserve finesse for the preparation of their product, not its presentation to the diner. Both have cozy, noisy rooms filled with happy eaters. But the excessive, gluttonous meal I had at APDC some years ago was prepared perfectly; I couldn't stop eating through 3 dishes of animal fat served with animal fat and a syrupy, heavy dessert. At Joe Beef I had to stop eating, and not because I was full. I hope I just hit an off-night because this is a restaurant I ought to love, and which I'll definitely return to."

The steak was one of the best I've ever had- juicy, cooked to perfection,  come with sautéed buttery spinach. Yum!

/user_details?userid=GMcaNurdP27eCQxO9YH_rg,Isaac B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Never before have I been so happy from a baked potato that I shed a single manly tear. And I guess booking months in advance helped us to get the romantic seat by the window. This is one of the best places I have ever had the privilege of eating in. Our waiter Patrick was very accommodating as me and my lady barely speak any French. His suggestions were phenomenal and his service was superb, as well as the chemistry between all the employees. A very friendly and cool environment. We started with the caviar dish that came with minced onions, egg whites and egg yolks, sour cream and these teeny tiny pancakes. ULTRA NOM because holy shit was that good. I'm Jewish, potato pancakes an caviar with sour cream are my life and no one makes them better than my mother. So sorry mom but now I want this dish every Hanukkah. I got the steak and potato. The steak was just... Ugh. Perfection. I felt like a white teenage girl who just passed Justin Beiber... With every bite! And the potato topped with bacon, mushrooms and escargot made me want to blubber like an infant. She got the lobster spaghetti, which was very good, but we both thought my steak was better, especially when dipped in her lobster sauce (thanks again to Patrick for the suggestion). I am a huge fan of lobster though and adored her dish. One bottle of wine and several shots of moonshine later, we were ready for desert (can you believe we are average weight and height? I know we sound like gluttons... We are). Triple vanilla ice cream on top of pear sorbet and topped with melted chocolate. By this point, we were stuffed, but the dessert was so crazy good that we got it down to the halfway mark before listening to our rational side and stopping. I've never had a meal or dining experience quite like Joe Beef before and I doubt I'll ever have anything like it again (New York City service is shit compared to the kindness of Montrealers). Thank you Joe Beef. Thank you Patrick for being our demigod for our time spent in your glorious house of gastronomical worship. Thank you for making a grown man nearly cry over the joy-infused baked potato."

Largely, driven by an arrogant, condescending waiter who took the notion of 'our reputation exempts us from having to be courteous to our customers' too far. Its cute and edgy to have a single chalkboard menu etc. But when you are being asked for help with choices, pairing of wines - then do just that. I am not paying you for snooty responses like 'we don't do Cabernets period' or 'I can't recommend anything'. In terms of the food - I have had far better steak, fish, and shellfish than at joe beef. The prep and presentation were also lacking. I do appreciate the fresh ingredients, some of which were grown in an urban backyard. I would recommend so many other spots before you waste your time and money waiting for an over hyped restaurant."

Definitely a pleasant surprise!We had pork fish sticks to start. Pork with fish stick batter and shape. It comes with mustard and pickles. Just a fun and interesting bite to start.For mains we had steak, a soup in a pastry (don't recall the name), rabbit, and lobster spaghetti.  Every single item was absolutely phenomenal. The rabbit had the most delicate flavor and the lobster spaghetti was perfectly al dente pasta, amazing sauce, and perfectly cooked lobster.The dessert is really what blew our minds.  The server dropped off a bagel with salmon and cream cheese and just waited for our reaction.  After a few puzzled moments, we told him we hadn't ordered that.  He said, that's the dessert, break into it and try it.  The bagel was pastry, the salmon was candied fruit, the onions were apple, and the cream cheese was ice cream.  What an amazing mind-bending treat!I've been to several Michelin 1 and 2 star restaurants in NYC and San Fran and I would say the quality of food at Joe Beef easily surpasses them in a much more casual atmosphere.  If you visit Montreal, I highly recommend making reservations well in advance so you won't have to trust in luck like we did.

Called in the afternoon around 3 pm and were able to get reservations for that same night for 9:45 pm. Super cute ambiance, although the seating arrangements leave you feeling a bit tight and cramped for space. We ordered fresh oysters, the grand aioli plate, the lobster spaghetti, and steak ambassador. Oysters, grand aioli plate and lobster spaghetti was definitely on point. The steak however was over cooked. We ordered a medium rare, and it came out as a medium. A lot of the reviews state that this was their best dining experience or the food was just so amazing.. it was good, however not amazing for us. Additionally, we felt the service was mediocre. The restaurant does not have a printed menu. Their menu is on a chalkboard by the bar which can be pretty hard to see given the dim lighting, and also dependent upon where you are seated. The host that seated us indicated that our server would go over the entire menu with us - well that did not happen. We felt as if our server was impatient and did not want to read off the menu to us. The table right next to us, however, was doing a tasting menu with paired wines and the server gave them the utmost attention. I definitely feel service needs to be 100% on point especially given their price points."
/user_details?userid=nf2VGfojsiRYAa3qtTFYZw,Molly Z.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,We were quite disappointed with Joe Beef after hearing about it for years and making a reservation months in advance. The soft shell crab was nothing special. I enjoyed the horse tartare but did not like the assortment of carrots it was served with. The steak was overcooked and we were never asked how was like it so we figured they would cook it medium rare. It came medium maybe closer to medium well. The lobster pasta was nice but nothing I'll be thinking about in the future. Also our service was horrible and people who were seated over 45 minutes after us were finished with their main dishes before ours even arrived. They ordered similar things as we did so there should be no reason for that. The waitress told us there was a problem in the kitchen when we voiced our concerns.

/user_details?userid=mDQhgesXXOKaDQW2o00sMg,Ron W.,"Santa Ana, CA",5 star rating,"I had a beef with Joe initially. It was frustrating trying to reserve a table. Many phone calls and no one answered no matter when I called. Then the Robo phone picked up and demanded Pin numbers, passwords and secret codes to get to speak to someone. The NSA would have had a difficult time getting through, and I thought it would have been easier to get a hold of the Pope. Finally, I worked my way to Bookenda which is their online booking service. They time your ""session"" and ask more questions than my internist. I needed a drink by the time they let me reserve a table at a B-list time of 9:45 PM, and it was only 9:00 AM when I hung up. Undaunted, we showed up at 9:37 and were asked to stand in the middle of the restaurant wedged in among other dinners and swirling wait staff which we did while squinting at the menu written in tiny script in French on a blackboard high up a wall. Eventually, we were asked to slide through the passage way to the next room and enjoy a drink before we were seated. The restaurant is a hodgepodge of small carriage houses linked together in a haphazzard fashion. Steps and  narrow pass throughs. We were deposited next to the bar. There was an L with only two seats....our grand luck. We hopped onto the comfortable barstools and shortly Kris, the bar tender/server, introduced himself and immediately realized that a drink was a medical necessity. He whipped up his special Dandelion ""drink your veggies"" which was truly divine and a whiskey sour made as good as the whiskey will allow. He translated the entire menu, made suggestions, took his time, told us about the things that weren't written on the menu and guided us to a half portion of the signature Lobster Spaghetti after we had pate and an Oyster Gratin. Both the pig and shelfish died happy knowing what was to become of them. Perfection on a plate. A platter of Walleye on lentils was sublime. Catch a fish, not too hard. Cook a fish is manageable, but to cook a fish this well is magic. All the while Kris was a non-stop fountain of useful Montreal info, not limited to food and drink but a cultural tour of the city as well. We thoroughly enjoyed the Cote du Beaune he recommended.  He was patient and helpful throughout our amazing dinner after we just let Kris steer. In fact, in all fairness, the entire staff is professional, and genuiniely interested in making sure every patron takes away a perfect night out. We closed the place  and would have happily come back in 7 hours for breakfast if they were open. Kris suggested the donuts stuffed with prune puree and topped with a Quebecoise artisanal cheese and locally sourced maple syrup. A combination that sounded like something from a kid's chemistry set. Wow, was it delicious. Kris finally had to yank the plate out from under my tongue. The entire eveing was a perfect experience, and all the accolades which caused me to try to dine there in the first place were spot on and nothing about the meal disappointed. The only thing I would have done differently is to book a table there for the next four nights. Don't miss this place. I miss that place."

The culinary heritage has its roots in France of course,  but with the benefit of a uniquely Canadian influence, dining out in Montreal can be truly magical.One of the most celebrated restaurants in Canada is Joe Beef. Taking its namesake from an irish-born 19th century tavern owner who catered to the working class and the down and out.  The Joe Beef of yesteryear served labourers, beggers, longshoremen, sailors and ex army men with easy service and most surprisingly, ""a menagerie of wild animals."" Joe Beef current day is a massively popular restaurant serving whimsical French market cuisine to locals and vistors alike in the not-so-quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Little Burgundy. The animals are gone, for the most part (the washroom boasts a bison...).Since 2005, Owners Frédéric Morin, David McMillan and Allison Cunningham, have transformed a small street just north of the Saint Lawrence into a bonafide culinary destination. Joe Beef is well regarded, popular, and often fully booked.  In order to keep up with the influx of diners, The Joe Beef team opened Liverpool House (a tavern) and McKiernan (a luncheonette since closed) within the same block. A mid-autumn road trip to Montreal called for some quality cuisine and I was lucky enough to score reservations for Joe Beef. I could not have been more excited.If Joe Beef has anything, it's personality. The decor is eclectic, in a 'found-and-meaningful objects' way. The walls are lined with wainscotting, subway tiles and a hodge-podge of collectibles and old maps. Chalkboard menus spell out the evening's offerings, changing weekly and featuring five or six new dishes at a time.  Renowned for a number of things, (rustic decor, oysters placed on inedible objects, liberal use of foie and seasonal ingredients) the Joe Beef kitchen creates whimsical dishes with intense flavour.  We were seated at a table on the heated back patio overlooking the impressive garden. A Series of raised planters and garden beds provide fresh vegetables and herbs for the kitchen. A DIY smoker in the backyard allows the chef to serve home made, house smoked, homegrown and thoughtful dishes with an artisan approach.  Joe Beef is all about the locally sourced and seasonal and having relationships with the purveyors, as well as top notch hospitality.Unassuming, cabin-life decor, comfortable with decedent eats; Joe Beef is on any gourmands must-dine list, and is a  true testament to the spirit of Montreal."

Our server was welcoming and very knowledgeable. We told him to create a menu for us, as we wanted the best of what they offered being as though this was our first trip to Montreal. The experience was nothing short of amazing. My dining partner and I agreed this was one of our best dining experiences EVER. You need to go here."

Delicious drink and was served with an oyster and shrimp. Delicious!

Chewy boring dish,  kinda mad about that one! The atmosphere was fun and unique, but as for ""pushing the envelope"" I was pretty bored."
/user_details?userid=WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ,Gillian T.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"I lived for 14 years in Lyon, France, arguably the gastronomic capital of Western Europe, so I know fine dining. What I love about Joe Beef is its decadence and, even, irreverence. I've eaten there 3 times in the past 18 months, and each time the experience was a delight for my taste buds (if a little hard on my ears).My last visit, at the beginning of November, was as pleasurable as previously. The service is always excellent, with staff ready to explain the menu and make recommendations. You really need the explanations because the chalk board menu just doesn't do the dishes justice. The problem is that, once you've had the full description, you'll want to have everything!I went with the eel nuggets, which made me think of seaside treats or a Dickens novel. Read Michael U's review for the perfect description. Suffice to say, they were delish. However, they were perhaps not the ideal starter to follow with guinea fowl stuffed with foie gras.I've said in other reviews that I like strong-tasting meats. Guinea fowl is more than chicken and less than duck, and more succulent than turkey. I couldn't finish this divinely yummy dish (picture me saying ""mmm"" with every mouthful), but it was just as good, if not better, (since I wasn't full from the eel), at lunchtime the next day. Other posh-ish restos might frown at a doggy bag, but Joe Beef staff know it's all about the taste experience and offer it before you can ask.A tip to get a table without booking way in advance: pop in and ask."

Sure, the wait is about an half hour long even when you have a reservation and the entire menu of what looks like 50+ different options is only written on one single chalkboard that sprawls across one wall of the restaurant, the place is still so fantastic. SERVICE+ Our server was the most darling and helpful waitress I have ever encountered. She started us off by spending literally 20 minutes translating and describing every single item on the menu for us in such a passionate and compelling way that we needed another 20 minutes to decide what the hell we should order from all the mouth-watering options. Throughout the night, she wasn't hyper attentive to our table, but she made it up by being so sweet and friendly. Oh, and she also came out with two desserts even though we only ordered one, because she knew we had made a conflicted choice and really wanted us to try both. Oh, and since we were the last ones in the restaurants on a Friday night, she poured us some shots before we left. BEST SERVER EVER. FOOD+ Overwhelming+ Incredibly delicious+ Everything we ate was delicious and somewhat heftily portioned, so my advice to you is this: Go with your gut. You won't go wrong. + If you'd like a more specific recommendation: get the duck. So so so good. AMBIENCE+ Love the soft lighting and the romantic feel of the strung christmas lights+ Filled with young, hip montrealers, out-of-towners, and any people who like to eat good grub+ The kind of place I would love to eat at every night of the week in New York. It has just the right feel of fun, casual, and hip without any of the pretension and wear-and-tear of overhyping. Absolutely love it!"

We loved our server Samia (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong) she was so knowledgeable and friendly. We pretty much just let her take the reins and order whatever she thought was good, and by golly did she do a great job. First she started us off with some stacked bloody caesars accompanied by a delicious and super fresh seafood platter ( oysters, snow crab, sweet shrimp..). Then an assortment of appetizers that were all very tasty. For our mains we shared the lobster pasta, a steak with blue cheese and greens and a side of frits paired with a delicious bottle of wine. To finish the night we ended with a layered cake and a flan tart that a perfect last note. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 start is because our food was served on the colder side and the pasta was stuck together in big bunches and impossible to separate. Seeing the reviews and hearing so much about this establishment my expectations were extremely high and if it wasn't for our server I'd give it 3 .5 stars because the attention to detail just wasn't their when it came to our main courses (which in my opinion should have been the highlights)."

On the whole, it was a great experience.*Service - excellent. Even though our servers were BUSY it didn't keep them from being on point about order taking/food delivery/drink refills etc. Our waiter even went through the entire menu with us (as it was only in French). They were also really affable and friendly which is always a plus.*Food - Foie Gras Double Down. This is a MUST. This may be the most flavorful thing I've ever eaten. I don't know if I could stomach a whole portion because it's sinfully rich, but the few bites I had were heavenly. Lobster Spaghetti. this looked like it might contain at least 3 whole lobsters, was cooked perfectly al dente, and had a rich creamy lobster sauce that somehow succeeded in not being overwhelming. Very nice, perfectly executed dish.Steak Joe Beef. So deliciously soft the way steak should be. It had a nice strong peppery flavor (which I actually tend not to like). One note: it is a very fatty cut (NY Strip I believe?). Not usually my thing, but this wasn't my entree so I wasn't too concerned.*Decor/Ambience - The place looks like a log cabin inside, which I actually really dig. The music was a mash up of things (think Tupac & The Smiths) which was very cool. Props to them for not censoring the music - this isn't a place for children.Why not 5 stars? A few reasons:- It's unbearably hot. Unfortunately, I had dressed for the 65 degrees it was outside, and couldn't remove enough layers to be comfortable in the stiflingly hot place. At $30-$50/plate, this always packed restaurant can afford another AC. - No printed menus. I get that it's part of the charm, blah blah, but many of the seats are not in a place where you can comfortably see it. I, for example, would have been interested in the wine list, but it was on a chalkboard far away in a high traffic area and it just wasn't worth the trouble (or added heat/claustrophobia).- About the prices. Totally fair considering what you're getting, but it'd be great if they did half portions on the entrees. They're all MASSIVE. Bonus: Try their house brew. It's really tasty - but be aware that a bottle will set you back $10."

Worth the $400 hotel bill we spent just to come to Montreal for the weekend to eat here. It's everything I've ever wanted food to be - somehow every bite of every dish was perfectly salty, perfectly sweet, melt in your mouth just daaaaamn. I can't stress that enough. And I was blown away by the service, everyone was so attentive and had great personalities, playful yet professional vibes abounded.And they had gluten free spaghetti noodles! They were hands down the best this celiac has ever had. My traditional Italian food lover boyfriend actually said he would eat gf pasta every time if we could get them. Sadly, they are made in house and not available for purchase, but one of our helpful servers provided a replacement recommendation. If I could save up the money I would come here every year for an anniversary of eating the best damn food I've ever had by eating more fantastic food.We split 3 entrees between us two: a half serving of the lobster spaghetti, the blue cheese NY strip loin (with amazing fries) and the rabbit sausage.

Apparently that was not something that the staff could handle, and so I had water with my meal - except that I ran out of water and could not get a refill! That would have not been a problem except...My entree (appetizer) was quite nice, but I felt that the sauce with my lobster spaghetti was bizarrely over salted. I left with my mouth puckered and feeling covered in salt. That is something that should never happen. And in the end, for me, Joe Beef is something that will never happen again."

GET IT!   I eat a lot and I've eaten in a lot of places and their lobster spaghetti will always be one of the things that will be on my mind like a first (good) love. The pasta is fresh (not from a box) and has the perfect bite, the lobster bisque sauce isn't too over-powering or salty, and there is so much lobster meat. The entire dish is just amazingly delicious. I split this dish and the bacon wrapped trout with a friend and we were stuffed. The trout was cooked perfectly and deboned from the inside. Our appetizer was a half order of their foie gras double down with maple syrup (who would've thought maple syrup would pair well) and their ham cold cut (I completely forgot the name of it and probably not doing it justice by calling it a cold cut - sorry).  Both were delicious. I believe the double down and the lobster spaghetti are menu staples.The service is phenomenal. The menu changes and there's only one menu and it's written on a chalk board. The servers go one-by-one, unrushed, through each menu item in great detail. They are also super friendly and down to earth.I really want to go back. Just for the lobster spaghetti. And to try a few more things. I cannot comment about the wine because I do not drink, but the servers are extremely helpful in helping you find something to pair with your dinner.The place is not too big, so reservations may be hard to come by. We walked in at 5:45 (door was open and one server was able to accommodate a reservation for 2 at 6pm), and waited at the coffee shop next door."

All fresh ingredients from Quebec or Canada. Their raw bar selection is quite impressive covering both Canadian coasts.  Everything on the menu is cooked to perfection, but it's very RICH.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful in ordering both food and drinks.  The biggest downside is that you must book your table many weeks in advance, unless you can get a lucky table from a cancellation on that day.  Expect to spend at least 2.5 hours drinking and eating your meal, despite you might have a table at 9:30PM."

I will definitely come back here in the near future. I want to try everything!The wait staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  They are also very knowledgeable with the items on the menu.There were four people in our party and we were seated at a nice cozy booth right across from the menu on the chalkboard.  It was dimly lit and very homey.  I wanted to take a nap after my meal.  We also noted the music was very good and a whole variety of old classics from the 90's. Haha.The four of us opted to get the special beer made especially for Joe Beef.  It was served in really large old fashioned beer bottles.  It was very refreshing and it went very well with our meal.For appetizers, we got the Foie Gras Double Down (how could you not get that?), single portion; raw oysters, a salad with cheddar cheese (sorry for the description but I cannot read French) and a white ham sliders appetizer.The double down was everything I hoped for. We split it 4-ways and it's a good thing I did.  It was delicious.  The two slabs of foie gras was deep fried, like fried chicken and in the middle was a bacon slice, some cheese and some greens. It was delectable.  A double portion would be very tempting but I think I'd die of a heart attack afterwards.The oysters were very fresh and served with cocktail sauce and a mignonette sauce. They were soo good. I wish we had more but one of the kinds were sold out.The salad was nice and fresh and it was a nice balance to the foie gras.  The ham sliders were also very good but very filling because of all the bread.For the main course, we ordered the rabbit, the Joe Beef Steak, the pork chop and smoked ribs.The rabbit was good - it tasted like non fatty chicken but that was my first time I had rabbit. My husband raves about rabbit and he seemed to love it.  The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and I ordered the Madame portion of it (10 oz). There was a Monsieur portion available at 18 oz but that sounded way too big with all the other stuff I was eating.  The meat was perfectly seasoned so I had no need of the steak sauce that came on the side and the bed of spinach was also delicious.  I don't know why it tasted so good but I just remembered it was like heaven on a plate.I was really impressed with the pork chop. It was a huge pork chop too and it was cooked to perfection.  Totally tenderly and it seemed like it melted in your mouth.  The smoked ribs was a surprise.  It was probably the best ribs I've ever had.  Smoked to perfection and falling off the bone. So freaking good.  These guys really know how to cook their meat!By that time, I had no room for dessert but my party each wanted their own dessert so I caved in.  I ordered Financier on the Cob and my group ordered the Patate au Four, the chocolate mint sundae and a panna cotta that came with some melon granita.  They were all delicious but I think the Patate au Four was the best one.  The coffee is also very good and I had some herbal tea that was presented really fancily. I should have taken a picture of it but totally forgot in my happy food coma.I will definitely go back again and that's a promise.  Make sure you make your reservations early. I thought I had made my reservation relatively early but only the 9:30pm openings were available on certain days.  This is a must go to restaurant if you enjoy meat.  It's perfection.I have a more extensive review on my blog complete with pictures but Yelp made me take the link off of this review....."

Except for the fries: the person who invented that dish should win a Nobel prize: Potatoes fried in beef fat, tossed in butter and garlic, sprinkled with parmesan... Very addictive. The whole smoked trout was the highlight of the night. It was just perfect. If you ask, they will show you where they keep the live trouts and where they smoke them. The trout is served with crepes, butter and pickled veggies. Appetizers were just ok. The chef must like pickles because they are present in many dishes. Lobster pasta was not great... All you taste is the brown butter. I was very excited to try this dish and was quite disappointed. The ham is made by a friend of the owners. This was the only dish that I would say was truly terrible. Basically just a slice of fat with no taste at all.

We started with a dozen oysters from four different bays off PEI (Prince Edward Isle). Tasted like they were just pulled from the water. We shared an endive salad, but not just any endive salad. It was beautifully presented like flower petals with a simple vinaigrette, blue cheese and candied walnuts. After listening to the server expertly run down the menu, I ended up having the shredded duck confit topped with a beautifully seared foie gras and a side of deliciously poached turnip. This was paired with a Gamay from the Loire Valley. Absolutely amazing! My husband had the ribeye, thicker and juicier than he expected, medium rare, and paired with a Joe Beef beer. The accompanying mashed potatoes melted in your mouth, creamy smooth. Dessert was a softserve vanilla icecream with caramel and toasted coconut.

Pâté made with marrow and Foie, then put back into the bone & served with chicken wings to dip. Rich, succulent, pretty incredible.Second Course: Pappardelle pasta with smoky tomato (BBQish) sauce, bone marrow & ribs. Pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce had a great smoky flavor, ribs were fall-off-the-bone.Third Course: Scallops & corn. Favorite dish of the night. 4 plump seared scallops over a bed of corn, lardons, greens & a corn based purée (I think). Loved it.Fourth Course: Can't remember. Might or might not have something to do with all the booze that night.Fifth Course: Horse Steak wrapped in bacon, cooked medium rare with about half an inch of herbed butter on top.

He was thrilled to see tonight's meal was served without a heavy blueberry sauce as before  - the meat spoke for itself. Not being a red meat eater, I chose a seafood dish and was also very pleased. The veggies are fresh from their garden and presented simply - which highlights their freshness. The menu changes daily, so we handed  our palettes over to the servers recommendations.  Everything was on target...a most memorable meal. Would go again if a trip to Montreal is planned:)"

If you are very very lucky, you might even get the table standing in the middle of their produce and herb garden, but if you are not, the experience is all the same in every corner of this place, meaning: eclectic food at its absolute best and amazing service filled with knowledge and care.Stop searching the internet for a menu, because you will find none. The menu is scribbled on a chalk board and varies with every season.If you have the firm intention of ordering a specific bottle of wine, let it be, the owner will choose one for you anyway.Whenever you get the bill, just throw your credit card on top of the unopened folder and forget about it, the one thing you do will remember for a very long time, is the best meal most of us will ever have. Enjoy!"

Love Montreal and with so many restaurants this is missable. Way overpriced and trying too hard to be out there with options. Could not even impress with the signature steak. Even for Montreal the service was uninspired. At half the price and no wait it would get 3.5 stars.Thankfully the company was 10 stars and it saved the night.

Coming with a very heavy weight - this may have been one of the best dinners of my life. Not just because it's a foodie maven hotspot. Not just because Joe Beef has won so many awards, and draw so much attention. Simply because the food offered was so far and above!  The staff gained excitement with mine, and wanted to offer me more and more.  Their suggestions were made with such enthusiasm, it was almost as if they were pre-enjoying it for me.   There was without a question a New Orleans ""lagnaippe"" (a little something extra) sense to the entire experience. Far exceeded any possible expectation, especially since the word is out.   How many times has someone told you about a place and pumped it up to the highest level, only to end up leaving the restaurant disappointed and scratching your head wondering what the hell they were talking about???  This simply was not the case.  Purely amazing.

This was like hitting the lottery so plan ahead and get reservations early because this place is worth it.  My friend and I all split appetizers and the smoked croquettes were a hit. We also had Moishes pickles (which are great) and a few other delicious appetizers.  I had a ribeye and two of my friends had the ambassador.  They were good aged steaks but I have to say the meal of the night was the spaghetti lobster. It's enough for two but our friend at the whole thing because it was amazing. If I ever return (and I'm thinking about it now) I will have the that meal (spaghetti lobster) along with as many appetizers as possible.

The foie gras parfait with pickled rhubarb and half roasted chicken with albufera sauce were knock-outs. Our server was welcoming and so excited about the food, which made ordering and chatting periodically a pleasure. She also helped us choose a wine in our price range that was special and to my taste, but stretched my wine experience. The marjolaine on the dessert menu is terrific and has apparently been on the menu for ten years.

They're known for Lobster Spaghetti and it was the best dish we ordered. The 16 oz steak was also quite good. Our final two dishes, the horse and the lamb, were pretty forgettable. There are better restaurants in Montreal where you get more for your money and don't have to wait weeks for a reservation."
/user_details?userid=Fuw6Aqacfl5Np4abNK0tzw,Chris V.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"After hearing loads about Joe Beef and making a reservation ahead of a trip up to Montreal, I reeeally wanted to LOVE this place. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe it was just an off night, but the lobster spaghetti was good, not great. Overly rich, yet lacking in the breadth of flavor we had expected. Maybe it was the overpowering amount of tarragon or savory that I thought I tasted, but it just didn't do it for my fellow diners and me. The ribeye steak (which the waiter took it upon himself to order for us, rather than the horse tartare we had  actually ordered) was decent, but with the generous layers of fat, large slab of blue cheese on top, and foie gras mousse rubbed all over, a bit too insane. Clearly, covering anything with a bunch of fat will enhance the richness, but after awhile, it becomes kinda boring. On the other hand, the foie gras mousse with brioche was excellent in a small dose and the pickled ramps that went with it were the perfect chaser. The oysters were fresh and briny. The garden salad, which had supposedly come from the Joe Beef garden, was light and crispy - just right after the heavier part of the meal. Dessert was great and included a pastry with pistachio ice cream covered in sour cherries. It was definitely a great ending to a better than ok meal. The service was kinda spotty. Maybe it was a cultural thing, but coming from NYC, I've experienced plenty of great service along with a fair amount of crappy and pretentious service. This seemed a bit in between. On the one hand, the older/balder/tattooed server didn't offer to take our drink orders at any point, forgot an item and added something that we hadn't actually ordered, which we were ok with accepting, but if you're not going to write down an order, you should at least be able to remember everything.  He was also a bit condescending when taking our order, with a couple of warm and fuzzy moments later that we could all appreciate. Maybe it was his shtick, but it didn't quite work. When we asked if we could order drinks, he did choose a few great wines to go with the food though. Perhaps this review was unfair, since we only tried a small part of the menu and it depends on ones personal taste, but overall, the mythical status given to Joe Beef seemed highly unjustified by the end of our dinner. I've definitely eaten much better meals with way greater and more professional service for half the price, after which I immediately wanted to go back for another meal. Sorry if that disappoints anyone, but I'm doing my best to be honest."

There's a lot of hype around Joe Beef, so the expectations were high and it it delivered spot on, validating its rank as one of he best places to eat in Montreal (or Canada really). The food was REALLY, REALLY good. They set a casual/comfortable atmosphere and the shuffle of songs included classic rock and post-punk. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, passionate and helpful ... no pretension here. It is, what I have come to refer to as a ""Chalkboard Bistro""; an excellent, creative restaurant that provides their menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I find this a little annoying especially for the wine selection process ... maybe they know you'll be back and want you to be able to review the menu for the rest of your meal. TIP; try to avoid seating times like 6:30 / 9:00pm. This practice often leads to several tables being seated at the same time and the servers getting slammed."

I've heard, read, and seen great things about this place. Got a ton of food while I ate here, but unfortunately since the menu is on the chalkboard AND in French, my friend and I had to ask for help and a translation. One of the items our waitress mentioned was a ""bacon wrapped steak"", not sure if she ever included the word ""horse"" in there, but I definitely didn't hear it. She also didn't ask my how I wanted my steak cooked, which I thought was a bit odd, but I didn't really think twice about it. It sounded good, so my friend and I decided to order that as well as the lobster spaghetti.The steak comes with a sausage and my friend goes, ""I think that sausage is filled with horse meat..."" so after eating about half of it, we both decide to focus on the steak. The steak was soft, tender, and really delicious. I remember thinking how good and tender the steak was, and how it wasn't as rough as most steak.When the waitress came by afterward, we asked if the sausage was filled with horsemeat. She said, ""sometimes it's beef, sometimes it's horse, sometime's it's half and half, but tonight it's all beef."" My friend and I both sighed with relief... BUT she followed up that sentence with ""...but the steak was horse! How did you guys like it?!"" To be honest, I was completely horrified at first. Not necessarily an angry or upset horrified, more stunned. It took a few minutes to register I just ate My Little Pony, but I came to terms with it.Everything that night was delicious and our waitress even gave us a bit of a dessert we were contemplating getting while choosing between two and picking the other option.All in all, a great experience and an awesome place. I would definitely come back again and I actually would probably eat a horse again. Thanks Joe Beef."

One other thing ; the owners should finally printed their complicated menu on a peace of paper , not everyone is willing or capable of struggling to pass through the tiny tables , get hit by rushing waiters and wear magnifying glasses in order to see the distant black board with a tiny hand writing listing hundreds of plates, in a very dim lighting , and let's presume one of the group has volunteered to do it, what about the rest, even a couple will struggle with this. The other option is to be obliged to get the help from waiters in a rush, who certainly don't have the time to explain all what's on the menue, that part it self ruins the experience before the overpriced bill comes and destroy it all together"

We got seated an hour after our reservation but that was OK because we got reservations that afternoon and they gave us a free glass of wine while we were waiting. However, once we were seated, our waitress implied that our food would be coming shortly. This was a surprise to us because we had not even ordered! Our waitress had ordered for us! We immediately said that we would like to choose our own meal. She ran to the kitchen to cancel what she ordered and then returned to take our order. After that, the service was a bit frosty. The food was only OK. Probably because we already had a bitter taste in our mouth from the strange service they think is ""hip""."

Upon entering, I could tell this was going to be special. dark, quaint, intimate, immediate attention at the door, table not ready but escorted to a tiny bar to wait, We were immediately met by the most wonderful server, instantly brought us three bottles of wine to choose from and the way she described them, you could just feel the passion and love for wine coming from her. I have never seen anyone so excited about wanting to help us pick the right wine. We were escorted to our table at this point and immediately created by Alexander. Hands down, the best server I have ever experienced at any restaurant in the world. She was genuinely interested in us, that were were here for the first time and basically told us, ""I am going to take care of you, I have something very special lined up"". She recommended a ""sampling"" of their menu and for the next three hours we proceeded to try 4 different mini entrees, 2 full entrees, dessert, another bottle of wine, and a desert liquor. We had the crouqettes (some sort of meat/cheese), foie gras, a wonderful salmon/cod/caviar dish on icerberg lettuce (made in the their smoker out back), and a bread/cheese/ham dish that literally was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. For dinner, lobster spaghetti and a horse filet (yes, they have horse filets in Canada). Absolutely wonderful and during all of this Alexe would sit with us, describe what we were eating, share a sip of wine, come back, sit some more. Our original server who picked our first wine would also stop by, just really interested in how we were doing. Dessert was equally special, a 50 layer cake that takes 5 hours to make, some sort of ice cream dish, at this point the wine and the dessert liquor had taken their toll, details got hazy :). This wonderful evening ended with hugs for Alexe, a promise to return, recommendations for brunch, just all in all a wonderful experience, with wonderful food and the kindest most genuine people I have ever encountered in a restaurant (or anywhere for that matter)."

This was my boyfriend and I's first time in Montreal, we chose this restaurant as our one ""fancy"" restaurant where we could splurge and no doubt we made the right choice! This place was easily the best meal we had on our trip.  We are originally from CA so we went in wanting to try food that we could not get in the States. For our appetizer we got the foie gra (duck liver) parfait served with two Texas-size toasted brioche slices. The parfait had a layer of spicy red pepper jelly on top and a side of a home-made garlicky chilli paste (that packed a big spicy punch in the mouth) which balances the richness of the foie. This dish was so well thought out and balanced, the inner foodie in me could not be happier. Our entrée consist of chicken with mash potatoes and peas, Horse filet mignon served with a side of beef-fat fries sprinkled with herbs and parmesan cheese, then finished off with a couple of hand-crafted cocktails. This is our first time trying horse meat, it was definitely a YOLO moment for me and it was amazing! According to our waitress, you had to eat it on the rare side to fully enjoy it. She didn't really asked how we wanted it cooked, she pretty much told us you're having this rare haha. It was definitely one of those moments where I felt that ""real restaurants"" that truly respect the food and ingredients, tell you how to enjoy the food which I totally respect and it didn't bother me at all. The steak was tender and not gamey. It reminded me of beef steak with less beefy flavor?, but the texture was the same and I probably would have assume it was beef if not otherwise informed. The chicken dish was also amazing! I tend not to order chicken at restaurants because the kitchen usually overcooks it becoming extremely dry and borderline inedible. But not this place! Most tender and juicy chicken ever! Cons: We barely touched the beef-fat fries because it was so heavy. The cocktails we got were mediocre. Mine taste like lemonade and a splash of vodka in it, for hand-crafted cocktails I guess I expected a little more of a ""wow factor"" and I was underwhelmed. Also, the double-down is no longer on the menu but the les parfait de foie gras totally made up for it."

/user_details?userid=IeAuNma3RYBECnpi_qzfLw,Captain M.,"White Plains, NY",3 star rating,"My first experience here -- as part of a trip with my son before he starts college -- was disappointing, mostly for me.First of all, right off the bat, just know you are going to spend a lot of money. The entrees here easily cost twice of any other dinner we had on our week-long Canada excursion. Not saying this is a negative, necessarily, but for this kind of pricing, you anticipate having a certain kind of experience.The place is very bubbly and friendly, very gastropub feeling, with all the dishes written in French on large blackboards. Our waiter patiently, but fairly quickly, went through every single dish with us in English.We had a choice of three beers -- we picked the IPA, which was on the bitter side.THE PLUSES: Lively, fun atmosphere. The opener we had -- sort of a jarmon ham dish that my son and I split -- was quite good. My son loved his lobster spaghetti -- he definitely made the much better pick for entree. Easy to get to from the Lionel-Groux station on the Metro, and a nice walk.THE MINUSES: I ordered the main course steak and it was really fatty. Much too much fat for this kind of price. The fact that they topped the steak with tomato slices made me think afterward that they were trying to cover that up. Maybe not. I am just not used to going to good restaurants and getting a steak with this much fat. Very disappointing. It also took a good 90 minutes (!!) between our arrival at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday night, and when our entrees first arrived. That is just TOO long.I really expected a better overall experience from Joe Beef."

/user_details?userid=3eaugebJbJVca7IwYSx9kg,Carolyn N.,"Edison, NJ",5 star rating,"Joe Beef is a great dining experience. The restaurant was not gimmicky at all after being featured by Tony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern's shows. The menu is in French and it's written compactly on a chalkboard on the wall in the middle of the restaurant. And, it's ok if you're not French savvy. Our waitress was really good at explaining all the dishes and recommended a tasting menu. She made sure my guests and I were ok with things like foie gras and horse tartare before deciding with the kitchen staff on what to serve.For starters, we had the scallops and sea urchin. Both were yummy, but not a must-have. Next were the Mattones shrimps. Not your conventional shrimp cocktail. The shrimps are much smaller and sweeter and head intact and all. Very nice. Moved onto the horse tartare and it was served on a thick piece of country toast. It was good and not what I expected. Entree wise, we had the strip steak, lobster spaghetti, braised pork shoulder, and the breaded fish (whatever the catch of the day is). Lobster spaghetti was really good. Heavy cream sauce with the lobster pieces served and very nicely cooked al dente pastas and prosciutto/bacon bits. Steak was tender and cooked very nicely as well. Pork shoulder ok. Perfectly cooked, but it wasn't a show stopper for me. The fish dish was surprisingly good. Nicely breaded with panko and was really tasty.The food is really good. Service is outstanding. The staff is professional, but warm and friendly. Their drinks and wine list looked amazing as well. We saw other people order the Bloody Mary and it was a gauntlet of proportions in a mason jar. They had two giant shrimps cocktails served with it just because why not? The food is on the pricier side, but I think it's well worth it. Portions are generous. And, overall...It's a really good dining experience.Tip: for their seafood appetizers, the staff will bring out their signature hot sauce. It's really good! They sell it too and I was very disappointed to have forgotten to buy it before I left. It's similar to cocktail sauce, but better.Also, make reservations online about two months in advance. The staff is very accommodating."

I had a feeling that the booking was for a bar seating (which I usually dislike in restaurants when food is involved) and checked with concierge to be told it is a table Walking inside the tiny restaurant I was ushered with my gang to the stools However, it was abolishing in disguise Setting on the bar gave me a) the space to move freely ( and not feeling cramped between adjacent tables that I can not go to the toilet or even move my handbag from attaching to my body)  and b) I had lovely chat with bartenders which made the night way more enjoyable The main aspect of any restaurant is the food And in terms of portions - it is so filling However my steak was overlooked My partner streak was undercook And my friend's main of fish was served cold ! In a nutshell we did not enjoy the food"

We needed help with blackboard since we don't speak French. No problem because the server was very helpful. She went over everything..good thing. I started with the oysters which were excellent. My husband had the half double down which I think enough has been posted about. He loved it as much as everyone else has on this board. For mains it was rabbit for me and lamb for him. The rabbit was so amazing with a carrot sauce and tortellini. I ate every bite...extremely rare for me. The lamb was so unique. It was in the shape of a giant ball and served with polenta and braised greens. He just about licked the plate. We typically skip dessert but had to have it since everything else was so amazing. We ordered the meringue and it was perfect- a completely unique twist of a dessert just like the other yelpers said. I highly recommend it and everything else we had. So glad we went here! Go if you can get a reservation.

Unfortunately now that I live out of town I don't get to enjoy it nearly as much as I'd like but that doesn't mean I don't dream about Joe Beef regularly.Last time we were there we sat at the bar and left our whole order up to him, everything is always so good so why not leave it to somebody that is always surrounded by all this awesome and he really didn't let us down.We started with a fantastic fresh salad with fresh house made buffalo mozzarella with grapes, basil, cherry tomoatoes, with a perfect vinaigrette. We then shared our mains.

Joe Beef steak was very good; a sausage and mussels dish also made me nauseated. Mashed potato side (puree p.d.t) was fine; kale side was flavored in a similar way to the asparagus entree and again nauseated me.  Two desserts were as nondescript as the entrees.  Homemade soft serve in a cold (literally, served chilled!) beignet.  If it was supposed to be a novel service of beignets, it is one that will not catch on.  It was disgusting.  The other was similar - homemade soft serve on a fried dough with some very unelegant looking strawberry pieces.-Presentation of all dishes revolved around just flopping food onto a plate.  So unappetizing.  This was a disaster meal, and I left totally annoyed.  Montreal has so many good restaurants (we had an impeccable meal the night before).

Brasserie T!, Au Pied de Cochon, Joe Beef and Le Bremner.  Joe Beef was fine, but not great. And it certainly didn't live up to the price food or service-wise. It seems to be riding on the hype a bit. The food was good, but we didn't swoon over any dish. The service was good when we had their attention, but forgetful and missing details in between those times. Le Bremner has been the huge stand out with regard to creativity and delight with food.

I usually prefer the bar because it's like sitting in the cock pit of a jet. This is where all the action is. At Joe Beef the bar is also where the oysters get shucked. Max was on duty and made my dining experience extraordinary. My first drink of the evening was an old fashioned. I figured i'd take the bar tender out for a spin just to get a sense of the place. Max then suggested local oysters and I was grateful for the suggestion. My next course was a corn chowder with curds and broiled mushrooms on top. This is one of their signature dishes and I recommend it highly. On my second trip back to JB (I had to go back because I was drawn by the food gods) I ordered the chowder again and the presentation was completely different but equally as good.On my first visit I ordered the broiled halibut which was served over a vegetables medley. Excellent. My drink was finished at this point and when Max asked what I was drinking next my slight hesitation was a signal for him to suggest a glass of wine which he chose for me and was perfectly paired with my fish.On my second visit I ordered the tournedos de Cheval which in French translates to horse. We don't eat horse in the US but my niece who was dining with me reminded me of my commitment to food. So away we went. Our server suggested cook temp ""as you would beef"". I would highly recommend this dish as it was extraordinary. Tender, delicious and less fattening than beef. On my first visit I was offered profiteroles for dessert. Theses are light little pastry puffs made with home made corn ice cream. WOW! Joe Beef is the true definition of what a restaurant dining experience should be. Great atmosphere, extraordinary, inventive cuisine and a staff committed to delivering the entire package in an impeccable manner."

Joe Beef has had a lot of attention because it's great but also because Bourdain has made mention of it many times when he talks about Montreal. You should not expect to walk in and get a table, yes that is how in demand this place is in the restaurant scene. My friend Matt was committed to getting in to this place during our guys weekend to Montreal alas NO RESERVATIONS. We decided to call Joe Beef a couple of hours before they opened and please our border crossing, meat loving, fine dining case to whoever would listen. After a bit of persuasion we were accommodated with a table that the staff described as a low table and not that exciting. It would turn out to be, in my opinion, the nicest place in the restauarant. They have a concrete patio table and benches in the middle of their garden in the back of the restaurant. It was a casual affair so it was perfect. We had not been there before so we asked our server to bring us (5 guys) the menu you think we should have and we will go with that. From the GIANT steak, salad, oysters, and so on it was really good on every level. A lot of there menu is seasonal so I will not dive in to specifics because it will be different and updated possibly when you get there. If you have an opportunity i would recommend you check it out. Bourdain did not miss the mark on this place and whenever I am within range I will try to talk them in to giving me a table for dinner."

The waitress was well informed about the menu and everyone accommodated our non-French speaking. One draw back is the price. It is extremely expensive so be prepared!  If you are visiting from the states, be prepared for 2 taxes and our bill with tip for 2 was nearly $300.  As I said before, excellent food but very pricey."

Maybe they broke up, maybe he finally opened the restaurant of his dreams. Whatever happened, all that stuff is now in an overpriced restaurant in Little Burgandy.Look, I appreciate fresh ingredients and a menu that changes so quickly that you can't be bothered to print menus, but really? Making your patrons stand in the middle of a tiny dining room, in the way of servers and freaking out seated diners by looming behind them, gawking at a blackboard that is so jam packed with overpriced food and seriously overpriced wine? That's just mean Joe. The food was not bad but really, if you cook anything in a stick of butter (steak, potatoes, greens) it will taste just fine.  Either sass up the menu to match the high prices or clear out some of your swag and take a more honest, down home cookin approach to your price list.Oh and minus three stars for the spoiled 21 year olds running back and forth from the bar to the bathroom doing coke.

/user_details?userid=egDymReIGgB2USiHWVSASw,Lee M.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Clearly, based upon the prior reviews of this place, Joe Beef is as polarizing as cilantro.  Unfortunately, I'm in the camp that didn't care for it at all.  I generally don't have such a huge problem waiting a few minutes for a reservation, but this place doesn't get it.  There is virtually no space at all to wait inside the restaurant, so you're either waiting on the sidewalk or packed in like sardines by the tiny bar.We opted to be cramped by the bar with no seats and watched the bartender/oyster shucker cut his finger while trying to open one of the oysters.  Ok, so he can't shuck an oyster, but what made it worse was that he proceeded with finishing the order without cleaning up his bloody finger.  Shortly thereafter, said shucker then smelled another recently shucked oyster, made a face, poured out the liquor and put it on the tray.  Needless to say, I was passing on the oysters.After watching that horror show for about a 45 minutes (we had a 9:15 reservation and were seated about 10:00) we were finally seated against the wall with the chalkboard menu.  (We asked for a seat in the courtyard, and were told that we were getting one - their response was, ""oh, sorry about that.  no seats outside."") Fine, since my wife couldn't see the menu, and doesn't speak french, we asked the server for some help.  Some people at the bar were sharing what looked like a veal chop with fiddlehead ferns - he said that it was a lamb shank and that it was spectacular.  We thought he knew what he was talking about.Given the late hour and the fact that we were grossed out by the oyster debacle, we skipped on starters.  Fast forward another hour.  I try to summon our server to ask where our food was.  His answer - well, your order didn't go in right away since you didn't order an appetizer.  Seriously?  It's 11pm, bring me my dinner that I ordered an hour ago.The food came, and it was not the same thing as what the guys at the bar ordered.  It tasted fine, but at that point, I was so disenchanted that I couldn't even enjoy it.  One thing that stood out was that it was a little too gamey.  My wife wound up eating some fiddlehead ferns for dinner since she couldn't get over the gaminess of the lamb.  The server came back to apologize and brought us dessert on the house - but who cared at that point.If I could give this place negative stars for my overall experience I would."

I was there on Friday night (Feb 19) and despite the food being tasty, the prices no way near proportional to how tasty.  Also, it is incredibly annoying to have to read an entire food and wine menu while standing up in a narrow passage-way.  It makes it very difficult to discuss with your dining companion what to share/have (which is usually an enjoyable process).  I had to keep getting up to see the menu to remember what went with what.  Also, with 2 main dishes included a $49 steak, one might expect more sides than some lonely green beans.  But my biggest disappointment with this restaurant was being lied to in the worst case scenario, or fobbed off in the best.  I asked our waitress if the skate was a sustainable fish and she said ""oh yes,  there are so many of them, they need to get rid of them."" with an air of confidence which made it seem as if she knew what she was talking about.  This is completely false.  According to this website, montereybayaquarium.org/…, ""Skates have been severely overfished and most are caught with bottom trawls, which result in high levels of accidental catch and substantial damage to the seafloor."" If she did not know the status of sustainability of this fish, I would have preferred she say she didn't know or ask the chef.  If she had done so, I would not have ordered this dish.  Very disappointing."

What sealed the deal was David Chang saying he thought it was the best restaurant in the world. We got 930 reservations at the bar and it ended up being a fantastic experience because the bar tender (also our waiter) was brilliant. He was excited about the food, funny, let us try as many wines as we wanted and overall made the experience. My wife and I don't speak French but he escorted us to the chalkboard menu and in the midst of bustling waiters and moving patrons he read the entire menu for us with out any rush or impatience - just amazing service. I had a couple of glasses of wine that might and my wife tried one of the speciality Father's Day cocktails which was gin based, crushed ice, lime, seltzer and some other light ingredients - great drink. We ordered the lettuce salad (which was fresh and crisp using vegetables plucked right out of the backyard garden). We had homemade frank and asparagus salad which was also excellent - the franks snapping and full of flavor. Then - yes - we got the half double down. I've read the David McMillan actually created it as a joke and that he thinks it's disgusting. However lovely bacon and cheddar sandwiched between two pieces of deep fried fois gras in just the right amount of maple syrup is wonderful and NOT disgusting. I suppose the idea of it is gluttonous - but whatever - te amo. For our main we ordered the glorious lobster spaghetti - which is so rich and flavorful and the lobster so perfectly cooked that we devoured every last bite. Good that we shared. For desert we took our fantastic waiters recommendation of the Yule Log which was layered with soft strawberry short cake, pistachio an then had little strawberries cut topped like trees and merengue mushrooms. Sooooo good. The music of the evening was reggae and hip-hop and it was never too loud to overtake  conversation but you could still hear enough to rap to Juicy by Biggie (well at least I could).

Tetes de violins are fiddleheads, don't you know? (Figured that one out myself!) The wine list-I don't care! I don't drink. Thank you Bill W. Prices. Are you kidding? My portion was ultra large. Well worth it. Now, to the meal. Our waiter brought out an amuse bouche of pork rillette and pickled vegetables. Very good and as far as amuses go, one of the largest servings ever. It could have been passed as an appetizer. We ordered appetizers of parfait of foie gras with plum jam and ricotta gnocchi with those fiddleheads and ham. Both were delicious. The gnocchi were so tender, the fiddleheads crunchy and the ham added the saltiness and flavored the sauce. The foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth good and very spreadable. It tasted great on the brioche it was served with along with the plum jam and a sprinkle of sea salt-like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for aristocrats. It's a good thing we had extra bread to mop up the gnocchi sauce and finish the foie gras.The main course came-duck and lamb with seasonal vegetables and each meat was served in a sauce reduction. It was a fairly straight forward presentation. The plates were delicious. The meat was very tender. We weren't expecting sides to be served, but we got scalloped potatoes and root vegetables which made our ordering of asparagus seem like overkill. But, we happily ate it all and shared the beignets for dessert. The service at Joe Beef is fabulous. The wait staff was very attentive (and cute), filling water at the right time, clearing plates and seeing to our well-being.

Joe Beef is where you go when you've had enough of clean living and want to give your arteries a workout. It's been a couple years since we've been here as recent media appearances by the owners (Bourdain's shows etc) have rendered this the go to spot for out of towners, and reservations are hard to come by. We met 5 groups in line (more on that later) and none were from Montreal. In that time Joe Beef seems to have morphed from a neighborhood restaurant into hipster central. Reggae and rap blasting all night, super informal service and packed with kids (we're in our 30's and felt on the cusp of irrelevancy amongst this crew).  The only sour note of the meal was waiting in line in the rain while looking through the windows at 15 year old servers languidly setting the five free tables while the five sets of diners outside who had reservations looked on. Come on guys, getting your customers indoors and seated should be the priority!But once seated all was forgotten. Perusing the chalkboard we settled on an opener of lobster and caviar, New Brunswick oysters, and raw scallop with pumpkin seed. Paired with a light and bubbly Rosé from Italy and our eyes were rolling back in our heads. Next up was the infamous Foie Gras Double Down. Twin pieces of deep fried foie forming the ""bun"" of a bacon and cheddar sandwich slathered in Quebec maple syrup. My informal calorie count had this somewhere in the the two thousand range. No problem since we paired it with in season local asparagus. Oops, the veggies are swimming in a tangy bechamel with more aged cheddar on top. Still the best asparagus I may have ever had, peeled and lightly steamed they were crisp and flavorful and offset the foie nicely. Our eyes were bigger than our stomaches and so we were only able to choke down a third of our shared steak. It came with fresh grated horseradish, and a fat slab of tomato on top with the whole thing resting in a gravy made and served right in the pan it was cooked in. Oddly antiquated presentation,  but the whole meal had something vaguely seventies about it which was actually kind of fun. We ended with espresso (way too bitter!) and an amazing rhubarb dessert. All in all one of the best meals I've ever had in Montreal, so despite the rocky start and the Peter Pan feel of the place the food lives up to its reputation."
/user_details?userid=XPvuTKja6Trpoeabaufedg,Katie D.,"Mountain View, CA",1 star rating,Had to order from a hard-to-read chalk-board menu. Dimmed light doesn't help. Food was overly salty and overly priced. Most French resto in town wouldn't disappoint. Lack proper steak knife. Great hospitality though. Would NOT recommend to others or visit again.
/user_details?userid=1Nkuhh-HOUB7XUfgImWxmw,Valentina D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Our dining experience here felt like we were invited to hang out at a very cool friend's very cool house with very delicious food. In spite of its ridiculously long wait-time to snag a reservation, the place is far from pretentious and the service was casual and warm.Our table wasn't quite ready when we walked in so we were invited to sit at the bar where the host poured us wine and made small talk, modestly downplaying the success of the restaurant, giving huge props to the great kitchen staff and talking about the various dishes on the menu as though they were children he could never be forced to choose between. Every detail of the decor feels random and perfectly kitsch-y but expertly placed; from the makeshift library of cookbooks near the bar to the giant gallon of gin and six pack of bitters above our table.  The music was equally eclectic - from Dolly Parton to rap in one sitting!My only pet peeve is chalkboard menus which force you to squint and invade other diners' personal space...but its a necessary evil of fresh cuisine. The menu was seafood heavy on our visit; as a meat eater I asked our host for a suggestion and was directed to the ""chou-croute""  which was a huge pot of sausage and cabbage with potatoes and a rich broth....impossible to finish but delicious!Our waitress, Samia, was fantastic. Sensing how full we were after dinner she brought us a serving of their home-made ice cream - a light concoction of rum and pineapple and all manner of goodness - and chatted with us like an old friend. The prices were more than reasonable - an entree, main, glass of wine and tea came in at under $60. Definitely worth the wait for a reservation!"

We went big and got a huge oyster platter to start; amazing selection of oysters from BC, PEI, and Maine that were delicious. We also got the smoked meat croquettes that were tiny bites packed with flavour. My partner obviously ordered the most expensive cut of red meat on the menu and I got the lobster curry. We accompanied with some cocktails and a bottle of red recommended by the waiter that was delicious. He was super helpful and clever and made the experience even nicer than it already was. We finished with a pear and chocolate ganache sundae that I literally still dream about. The food was really spectacular and the wine and service matched. I will be back again and again."

After having AMAZING meals at Bar Henrietta, Wilfrid, L'Express, Au Pied du Couchon, we thought we were saving the best for last. Instead, we were met with distracted servers, mediocre food, and an outrageous bill. While all the tables around us were laden with food, we waited at least an hour for our appetizers which were timed oddly and felt completely out of order. The server tried to pass the vichyssoise as a palate cleanser, but really, it meant they couldn't pour the weird fishy concoction into tiny bowls and get them out to the table any earlier. Meal went down hill from there. Worst part was a train wreck of meat and shellfish passed off as a signature dish. It's not easy to cook all these ingredients separately and boy did they miss the mark. Save your money and go somewhere were you'll be treated and fed well--there are too many places in Montreal to enjoy that far surpass this one."

/user_details?userid=-w8Fc9cWb7EZZ1z2s_PcFA,Melissa T.,"Lebanon, NH",3 star rating,"I had been looking forward to going to Joe Beef after reading many positive reviews online. Upon arriving, I was warmly greeted and was seated at the bar as I was dining by myself. The ambience was comfortable but a bit loud with table talk.  The bartender, Jan (male), was extremely hospitable. Being a non-French speaker, he was kind enough to tell me the menu options in English as the menu was on a large chalk board in French. I ordered the asparagus salad and the marinated flank steak with crispy Gruyere cheese and sauerkraut.  The meal started with my drink, a gin and tonic, which was perfectly mixed for me as I do not prefer my drinks to be heavy on the alcohol. After some chatting with Jan, fresh bread and butter, was brought out. Then came the asparagus salad consisting of three different kinds of asparagus, shredded endive, julienned apples, arugula, chives, pine nuts, and almonds all tossed in a light creamy vinaigrette. The complexity of flavors and textures was extremely well-balanced amongst the sweetness of the asparagus, the bitterness of the endive and the sweettartness of the apples. The nuttiness of the pine nuts and almonds rounded out the salad. The salad was large enough that two people could share comfortably.The marinated flank steak arrived about 40 minutes later. The presentation was beautiful and the aroma immediately took hold. The steak was sitting on a bed of saute' sauerkraut . A thick slice of bacon, it seemed steamed, was atop the steak. A caramel-golden rectangle of deep-fried gruyere cheese nestled against the meat. I sampled the sauerkraut first taking in the rich in the juices from the steak. Amazing! I cut into the flank steak and due to the low level lighting, couldn't tell if the steak was cooked medium-rare as I had ordered. A couple of bites into it, it was a little dry and more medium-well. The steak was extremely salty perhaps from sitting in the marinade a little too long. A little disappointed, I cut into the fried Gruyere cheese with some difficulty to find an empty shell devoid of cheese. Apparently, the cheese was left in the fryer a little too long.On the event that I come back to Montreal for a visit, I would be hard pressed to say that Joe Beef would be my first choice of restaurants to visit. The service was incredible and the asparagus salad was AMAZING! But for the high price, being given a meal that was over-marinated, over-cooked, and over-fried was a little bit of a turn off. There are a plethora of excellent restaurants to try outside of Joe Beef."

People around us at the bar were all upbeat.  It was all fun!  One more thing... I inadvertently left my mobile phone at the bar and the bartender had the wherewithal to find my friend's cell number on my phone and call to alert us about my mistake.  Over the years we've tried out a lot of restaurants in Montreal.

Slightly more than three stars but not the five that we've experienced on previous visits. While the private import wine was lovely, everything save for the reliable spaghetti au homard was either dramatically bland or over-seasoned that night.

Nevertheless, wonderful service and a great atmosphere. I just hope this is an aberration rather than a trend."

The table does come with bread, so you can use that too.Every single bite of 2 fried foie gras, aged cheese, a little mayo and bacon was heavenly. Not only that, they brought out home made donuts with aged cheese on top.... very interesting. The donuts were very fresh and soft. The little bit of cheese made it a little savory, interesting and also will give you a heart attack if you haven't had it yet."

Another glass of Chinon, and then we received a lobster spaghetti that had 1.25 lbs of lobster on it held together by bacon and creamy perfection, along with a grilled trout that was accompanied with beans and some kind of parsnip puree.   Whatever it was - it was perfect.We finished off our meal with the cake - the cake was as good as the beginning and the middle of our dinner.  Steakhouse prices but it doesn't take away from the experience.  Pier and our waitress were A+."

We were not disappointed!We made reservations before coming (which is highly recommended since this place fills fast). When we got there, the staff greeted us warmly and explained that the menu was on the chalkboard across the room. Most dishes were in French, so we asked for a translation from our server. She was more than willing to help out, explaining dishes to us with a significant depth of knowledge.For appetizers: we chose bone marrow (garnished with beef and thinly sliced pickles, served with toasted brioche) and sweetbreads (with a sweet sauce over a bed of rice). Both were fantastic.For entrees: I ordered the Dover sole and my companion ordered Hot Chicken Joe Beef (a deboned and flattened chicken, cooked in its own juices, served between two pieces of bread).

Every bite was better than the last. By the time I finished it, I had a food high I rarely get, and I couldn't stop bragging to my wife that I made the best ordering decision for appetizers. For our main, we ordered a special for two, neck of lamb. When it arrived at our table, I imagined how I would feel after dinner, it was a lot of meat! It was also probably the best Lamb ever. No meat hangover either!If I had to point out any weakness, I might say it's that the menu is located solely on a wall chalkboard, which although the staff was happy to take the time to explain preparations, I felt a little awkward standing in the middle of the small dining room trying to decide what to order - although others were doing the same.I also imagined we'd be packed in like sardines.

By far the most delicious thing that we ate was the foie gras & duck egg appetizer. It completely blew me away! Even the homemade bread that they served on the side was delicious! We also got the horse tartare appetizer which was also very good. So different- when do you have the opportunity to try horse?! For our entrees we tried the chicken with mussles and the lobster spaghetti. Both were very good but we're not as good as that foie gras. They set the bar high with that one.

/user_details?userid=Rn3jXBM3gYfmPmSgGJQH9g,Christopher L.,"East Calais, VT",5 star rating,"Let's be honest, I myself heard about Joe Beef, like many others, because of Tony Bourdain. Shoot me. I love just about everything about Montréal and I visit many, many times a year but I had never been THAT far down Rue Notre Dame. So, naturally, after watching the Québec episode of Parts Unknown, it was only natural to try it. I was, however, rather dissuaded by some of the negative reviews here. After all, just because it's on TV doesn't mean it's good. It could just be hype. But, after making reservations a good 2-3 months in advance, I decided to go for it.And, let me tell you, I am glad I did because, from the ambiance to the waitstaff to the wine list to the food, Joe Beef provided me with the single best dining experience I have ever enjoyed. The waitresses were abundantly friendly, helpful, and attentive from the moment my girlfriend and I stepped in, even though we chose to operate ""en anglais."" We started with a lovely Burgundy from the rather extensive, French-heavy wine list. And, while I'm not the kind of person that can thoughtlessly drop hundreds on a bottle of wine at a place like this, having recently been to a comparable French restaurant in New York City where even the Côtes du Rhônes were nearly $100, the Joe Beef wine list impressed me. For food we started with oysters and the lobster-pork sausage, both of which were great. And for the main course we split the Ribeye (20oz!) which was marvelous and described by the girlfriend as the best she's ever had. Indeed. For dessert we split the gâteau marjolaine and espresso, both of which were great. When it was all said and done, although we had had a rather early reservation, we emerged from Joe Beef nearly 3 hours after entering, something I've never before experienced. An older Italian gentleman proprietor of an old-school restaurant on the Emilia-Romagna episode of Tony's show, to paraphrase, talked about how he liked providing ""two hours of pure happiness"" in his establishment and, as far as I can tell, that is just about the perfect justification for dropping a lot of money at Joe Beef."

Top Marks.Pretense ? 10 out of 10!!First we were shown to the blackboard menu on the wall (they do not give you a printed menu), so you have to stand, with other diners, in a cramped dining room, and decide on your meal & wine, while standing over other diners (I later experienced this, with people standing behind me throughout my meal, bit weird).First issue, most things are spelt in French, second issue, a lot of things lack decent descriptions, so if you have a question, you have to wait standing and ask a server.The wines are very overpriced too.Next major issue, they have cramped the tables in so close that they have to slide the thing out from the wall so you can sit down and you have to get their attention to do this every time you want to use the restroom. Crazy carry on.  You are way too close to the strangers either side. The food is excellent but everything else takes away from it.I would not recommend."

But somehow, with enthusiasm and ambition, we were able to stroll into the Pentagon around 8:30p on a Saturday, and get seated right away.We started with a dozen oysters, which were tasty and fresh. Ok, not the BEST oysters I've ever had (see my L'Orignal review), but solid.Next, we ventured to the fresh burratta that was flown in from Italy that day. Prepared with carrots 4-ways, it was a very original twist on the traditional salad. Buttery and tangy, the cheese bounced nicely off the crispy, semi-sweet carrots. For our main courses, we split the Joe Beef Steak and the reconstructed lamb (I forget the Polish term used for this style of taking all the meet and arranging it around a bone). The steak was tasty, but nothing special. In fact, I only took about two bites of it before concentrating all of my attention on the lamb dish, which was phenomenal. The meat was tender and succulent, and the accompanying escargot and pieces of fried bacon, pearl onions and reduction sauce were pretty unforgettable. Heavy fare for sure, but so worth it.The fries dusted with parmesan and the creamy polenta made for well-matched starchy sides to our very rich main courses. Everyone on the staff we interacted with, from the bartender to our waitress to our busser, was friendly and knowledgeable. It was very apparent that they're all proud of being part of this establishment. The fantastic service and the pleasant atmosphere of our garden-side table rounded out a really wonderful dining experience."

Although it was too dark to see anything, especially menu in French, we went with the server's recommendations. We had the foie gras with ham as appetizer, follow with two mains which we settled on 1.5 lbs lobster spaghetti and the steak. It was wonderful, especially the lobster spaghetti, the flavor of the sauce was full of the freshness from lobster yet creamy which compliment well with both the lobster and spaghetti. Next was the steak, it was again very very good, especially the fatty part of the steak, it literally melts in your mouth! For a group of four girls, we could only fit one appetizer and two mains as the dishes in Joe Beef is very rich in flavors and super filling! It was memorable and I hope to try again next time I go to Montreal, perhaps a different dish, but I probably have to bring a French dictionary and a flash light!"

/user_details?userid=9Ycqg11sptaHk2vP0EYYeQ,Leigh O.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We came from Toronto, both having worked at reputable restaurants there. We were excited to try Joe Beef as we saw it featured on David Chang's Mind of a Chef and Bourdain's Parts Unknown. We made a reso three months in advance. At first we enjoyed the casual fine dining experience - servers dressed laid-back but were also attentive to details like wiping crumbs off the table after each course. The server directed us to the lobster spaghetti and the Joe Beef steak. Our server was very into up-selling ie. we asked for a $100 bottle of wine and he insisted on a $150 bottle of wine. The food came quickly for this price point - there was no pre-dinner linger to chat and enjoy drinks. We understand some people don't like this but we do. The food wasn't overwhelmingly rich rather subtle flavours and delicious. The disappointment was when we ordered the lobster spaghetti - a portion of the lobster was black which our server immediately took the the kitchen. They apologized, we began sharing the steak as they prepared what we assumed would be a new pasta. They actually used the meat from the original pasta (unshelled) and just re-tossed it all - not what we would have expected when ordering a $50 pasta. By the time it arrived we had finished the steak and were pretty full already - breaking up the flow of this 5 star dinner. We finished with coffees and dessert. The bill was $350 and they didn't so much as comp us for two coffees. Any restaurant should compensate a mistake even with something as small as free coffee and a dessert and this is speaking from our own experience in the industry. From a distance we could see the 5 star experience but the unwillingness to be accountable left us feeling underwhelmed with the whole experience. Enough so that we won't be returning again which is a shame as we visit the city a couple times a year. We're sure people go there and have a great experience, unfortunately we wouldn't go back as Joe Beef doesn't seem to be the kind of restaurant that guarantees that experience."

/user_details?userid=L0KyPYMZGlWZfwdqPkjdGA,erin b.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"After a recommendation from locals we met who seemed somewhat cool, and reading reviews promising extremely good meat, we rode bixi bikes here from old town on our second night in Montreal. It took much longer than we expected for some reason, this city is bigger than it seemed at first. But we arrived around 10 pm and were surprised (in a good way coming from NYC) to still see a line out the door waiting to talk to the hostess at that time. We didn't have reservations but they were able to fit us in at a tiny, but private area of the bar in the back room. We felt like we were at a larger version of five leaves in Brooklyn. We were confused about the blackboard menu and couldn't really see it at all from where we were, but had already been told to order the lobster spaghetti and ribs so ordered those two dishes and a salad, which we were told came from their garden. Everything was excellent, bartender who took our order and talked with us during the meal was very cooland friendly, we had a couple of glasses of good wine and they even gave us free dessert because there was an extra one someone ordered on accident. We had no idea how much any of this was costing since there was no menu we could see, but we were buzzed and on vacation so didn't really care. We were slightly alarmed when the bill came and the entrees were $50 and $30. Everything else was pretty normal pricing. We still don't know which was $50, but guessing the lobster spaghetti, which was amazing and worth almost any price. All in all was excellent food, very cool place, slightly overpriced and confusing ordering system/menu but worth it, just not for everyday. I would actually recommend sitting at the bar, I felt like we had better service (it was like having our own private waiter) and it seemed more comfortable than the tables I saw, the tables looked tiny and cramped."

Our waitress was easy on the eye. She was beautiful so when she informed us we only had two hours for drinks, appetizer, dinner and deserts we all just agreed to the rules and nodded our heads.

I should have seen the red flag in the first place when someone from the restaurant called 90 minutes before the reserved time to ask if ""we were still willing to go on with the reservation"" (they didn't say they'd call to confirm when we originally booked). I was a little puzzled but did not think much of that at the moment.We entered the restaurant right on time only to find no one welcoming us. No smile and ""I'll be with you shourtly either"": we were instead left waiting in the minuscule bar area for five minutes while being pushed by busy waiters before someone approached us and opened us with an ""Aaah, ok"" after I stated we had a reservation. Said waitress then goes away for another two minutes before a different employee leads us to our ""table"".The table was outside, which no one alerted us too during the reservation process. It was not even a wooden table like the rest of the restaurant had, but a small, short, uneven-legged, metallic *garden* table covered in towels (yes, towels) as smaller objects would otherwise fall between its pierced surface. No word of apology or checking the table was ok for us, or reason why it was different from all the others was uttered at all. It took us a minute to realize it was places so that it was impossible to read the (French-only) menu on the blackboard while seated: we had to stand up and walk ten steps to contemplate it. No wine menu was present on the blackboard.At that point, I thought back at the confirmation call and it all made sense to me: they were fully booked and just wanted to get rid of the English-speaking Yankees to make room for a better-connected party: as we confirmed the reservation, rather than decline the late bookers they just gave them our table and places us on a add-on, preposterous arrangement whose most immediate relative is the children table of your family wedding. A quick look at Yelp reviews from my iPhone confirmed this was exactly the way Joe Beef does business: you stay classy, Joe Beef.We should have left the place at once, but we went on to order an entree and a main course (no wine, as there was no wine menu in sight nor we were asked if we'd like some by an overly hurried waiter). The food came in (rice with beef Indian way, zucchini flowers, veau liver and salmon a la Provencale) and was good in an absolute sense but not remotely excellent or consistent with the prices Joe Beef asks (the two of us paid $120 with no dessert and wine).The climax was as another waitress approached my gf with the line:""Don't you feel like in Italy with this small, romatic table?"". The girlfriend, actually being a citizen of Italy, where such a treatment at a restaurant is unheard of, could not help responding with a dry:""Not really"". Surely enough, word came to our designated waiter we did not like the towel-covered table and he came in offering the usual free dessert you can read about in so may Yelp reviews. He did so in a hurried, annoyed way and did not accompany it with the slightest hint of an apology. We turned the cake (of his choice) down and proceeded to pay and not let the unfortunate incident of walking into this establishment ruining our night any longer.I have the utmost respect of anyone working in the restaurant business and the highest admiration for the daily miracle most of them make happen in the face of countless logistic and financial obstacles and risks, in order to make a living for themselves but also to put a smile on the faces of their guests, from whence comes, I believe, their professional realization. For this very reason, it deeply saddens me that the restaurant business is also populated by the likes of Joe Beef, which, in the light of all the similar experiences here, is obviously cashing in some early success by reguarly ripping off and disappointing their guests, especially the new ones. In the age of Yelp, this is a strategy for meeting one's demise, a fate that I believe will touch this establishment sooner than later. In the meantime, don't do yourself a disservice by believing your travel guide, and steer away from 2491 St. Catherine Ouest: I am sure you'll find dinner spots more deserving of your money and, above all, trust."

/user_details?userid=SUMGKjiTdVEy4HpCw-9uwQ,David H.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"DO NOT BE DETERRED BY THE NAME. This place does not only offer Beef. See website for details. One of the best restaurants in Montéal. Great wine list, well made drinks and a champion oyster shucker (or so I'm told).But really it's all about the food. Joe Beef serves up all types of dishes, but the one that you would probably think of when you hear the name is their Rambo sized steak for two, can't say that I've had it but I hear its good. The only other constant on the menu is a pasta dish thats made with a whole lobster. Haven't had that either, and I don't suggest you do. With seasonal dishes constantly updated and their proximity to Marché Atwater there really is no reason to go with the permanent menu items.When I went there I had an artichoke heart salad that was beautifully dressed with a lemon butter vinaigrette. Actually, my artichoke heart salad came with no artichoke hearts, the wait staff kindly brought me another. My main dish was skate. It was fantastic, braised in a mushroom red wine sauce. My dinning companions had the double thick cut pork chop which was roasted with a nice slight pink interior. Desert was a cream in the vein of english clotted cream with strawberries soaked in balsamic vinegar topped off with mint and a piece of brittle.I highly recommend this place."

However, I ordered the lobster spaghetti and I was in lover with it. A friend had a horse steak and another couple got jarret d'agneau. Huge portions. Food was great along with service. The restaurant is noisy and loud. I would definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=2Tfxtv7B5k3dKVSmDnKzXA,Peter B.,"Halifax, Canada",4 star rating,I was expecting a hyped up experience and that is what Joe Beef delivered only the food was really good. I would advise anyone going here to be watch out if they do not like organ meat because the table next to us ordered rabbit and duck but all I could smell was kidneys? There food smelled like piss and it made me feel a bit sick. My wife and I ordered whatever the waitress said. My 12 years of cooking experience in professional kitchens did nothing for me in terms of understanding the full on French menu on the hard to read chalkboard. The waitress very proudly said we sold out of this and that etc... Interesting point of view? Here in my city heads would roll if we ran out of anything really people get fired from kitchens for under prep anyhow. We got the sea bass for two as a main and I had a very interesting beet soup my wife enjoyed god knows what? It looked like a snow globe with currents and oil? She let me taste it and it was some kind of cheese unlike anything I have had before with artichoke and could have been pancetta I am not really sure. The most interesting part of the evening was the music guess just guess???? Wrong it was Biggie Smalls bitches eastside all up in the joint for real. I wanted to toss my folk and knife over my sholder and show off my gang signs. I prefer 2 pac myself not even kidding. For a 150 dollar dinner after tax and tip I should have dam well requested it. Peace out bitches... Westside!!!!

I know the wait is like 2 hours, the service is a hit or miss and the price is sky high, but the food, oh the food, is freaking awesome!

/user_details?userid=oiSwF3sztIOfd-S1ICpOHw,Vi D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So excited to try and know so many people who love it. Went for dinner with new people we were entertaining for work,  one was from Quebec City and he was excited too. Wowowow,  this place does not live up to its hype AT ALL. We tried 8 different dishes among us and 6/8 were waaay too salty. I couldn't even finish my main which was deer in puff pastry. No one finished their food in our group. I eat out a decent amount and this is one of two restos I will never return to due to over-salting their food. Service was good, nothing special. As for not being able to recommend cause the menu is made the day of, that is BS. Many places of the same caliber have their wait staff taste the menu and learn it before shift starts. And seeing as how the same entrees keep being talked about on yelp, they most certainly can recommend something. Our meal was paid for but prices are just a bit higher than many restaurants in Montreal but not bad. Truly overrated. Go anywhere else on the same street for better."

Oh the disappointment that ensued.The good:-The wait staff is genuinely friendly and knowledgeable.-The duck spam was the best breakfast sausage I ever ate.  It's accompanying asparagus tasted more like asparagus than any one (of many) I ever cooked.-They make amazing French fries.  -Their bread is moist and flavorful. -My girlfriend enjoyed her braised lamb main, and it was indeed tender, but I found the flavor was merely average.The bad:-The menu is in French, which forced the waiter to read us every item on it.  It created a lot of pressure to choose on the spot.-The menu is on a chalk board only, so anyone with his or her back to it is out of luck.  Also, it isn't visible from the bar area, so bar patrons are reading it over your shoulder.  Really, you're so high on yourself that you can't print it bilingually and on paper? -The much-talked about app of bacon and cheese stuffed between two pieces of fried foie gras is very good, but not worth writing home about.  The bacon was pure limp fat and the foie coating was oil greasy (not foie greasy).-The lobster sausage main was disappointment on a plate.  The accompanying clams and mussels were good enough, but the squid was rubbery and the sausage was poor.  First, it was dry.  Second, it had no lobster flavor.  Third, when I dissected it, the few pieces of lobster claw meat it contained were bone dry.If you want good food, by all means eat here.  If you want a revelation, go elsewhere."

Ok so the chalkboard menu and wine list are a little inconvenient but the food makes up for it. I had the best lamb shoulder roast (for two) with a side if polenta. I wanted to cry because we couldn't finish it. The meat was so tender, gives falling off the bone a new meaning. Apps of raw oysters and gnocchi were also hard to beat. Will definitely go back for more Joe Beef!"
/user_details?userid=L96AN73fhrtBjw2afDvhuA,Holly G.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"Yes, you have to go. Yes, it will be memorable. They are irreverent, charming, hospitable, and they know their way around the kitchen. We had the double down (OMG), a rabbit dish, a pork chop, and cheese. The only disappointment was the Canadian pinot noir, but hey, it was Canandian wine. That's what we get for ordering it in the first place. The waitress decanted it for us, which improved it considerably. Our reso was at 9:45pm, and honestly, it was the perfect time. I don't think this place gets cranked up for a while. It was prime time to dive in by the time we arrived. I bought the vanity cookbook, which is hilarious. I may be enjoying it even more than my night at Joe Beef. The tables are tight: they have to pull it out for the inside person to be seated. We chatted with our neighbors, who were charming, but it woud've made for a miserable experience if they sucked because there's no escaping the people next door. All that said, I had a better experience for a slightly less pricey ticket at Au Pied de Cochon. Try to do both, but if you have to choose just one, I'd go with APDC."

The service was excellent and although we had bar reservations they gave us a table instead which was nice. A downside is the impossible to read chalkboard menu which was behind me so either you have to awkwardly stand behind diners and stare at it or crane your neck 180degrees which is not comfortable at all. The bread was soooo good, best bread i can think of. The asparagus with egg and duck sausage was a great flavorful and rich appetizer and I was basically full after it but had already ordered the lamb which was succulent and fall off the bone. My boyfriend had the double down half which he did not think was the revelation everyone else seems to think. His lobster sausage was good but didn't blow his mind. Overall a hearty rich meal, came out to 120 with top which I guess isn't horrible but for no drinks or dessert is quite pricey!"

/user_details?userid=lfFmv3vZAflRnFMywEKu9g,Erika F.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"A.ma.zing. They got a number of things amusingly wrong, and yet they earned 5 of my stars. The negatives: We had reservations at the bar for 9:30 on a Friday night, but we weren't seated until 10:30. We ordered 10 oysters (which would mean 11 by their throw-in-one-extra way with oysters) but we got 9. My date ordered the 8 oz sirloin but was served the 16 oz. The positives: they gave us a couple glasses of interesting, delicious wine to ease the wait. All the staff were super in their demeanor and knowledge. The oysters were delicious and the homemade cocktail sauce like nothing I've had before. I ordered the duck steak au poivre and it was, comment dit-on, perfect. My date ordered the aforementioned sirloin, which he says was perhaps the best steak of his life. It was served with wilted greens and a sauce I can best describe as a cross between A1 and chutney. And they charged only for the 8 oz since the upsizing was their mistake. It's cozy crowded noisy happy. I would definitely recommend it and go back if I'm ever again in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=-w6JENytJbsQCqW-jDUWzg,Kenny T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We had a great table on the patio - really is cute back there, especially the table for two in the garden. I think the cool factor is high and the crowd is hip - definitely a fun spot. I found the menu creative, maybe to a fault (do we really need duck heart tacos?). I ordered to Burratta, which was ok, but not as good as others I've tried. I also had the schnitzel, which was fabulous, and huge! The oysters were fresh and delish. They are famous for the lobster spaghetti which was good, with generous portion of lobster (but very pricey). The rest of the menu changes regularly and I got the sense that the kitchen was free styling, since what came out was not always what was described by our waiter. So why the 3? It is over priced. 30 / 40 for mains seemed unnecessary. Also there were some misses at our table - including the scallops and the Cornish hen. Also the service was slow, though the servers were very friendly once they got to us."
