I ended having their Captain crunch burger, it was huge but so delicious. It had these generous pieces of fried chicken and a perfect mix of coleslaw in the bun. The chicken was just the perfect crispy. I also got a sample of their spicy sauce, which I immediately fell in love with. I'm definitely going back to pick up some if that homemade spicy sauce. I also want to try everything else on their menu!"

Very very good food. Quality ingredients, and a very creative menu without having so much to choose from that you have trouble deciding. To make it even better, the people who work there are just fantastic. I hope this place takes around for a long time!"
