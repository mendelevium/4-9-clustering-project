/user_details?userid=ugsr4XVIpaFNLF-9F2315g,Kelly T.,"Vienna, Austria",5 star rating,Amazing Peruvian food - would recommend. 100% get the ceviche and the octopus! Incredible dishes. Also the calamari deserves mention! Would come back.
/user_details?userid=aEdwKSzDnHIadYuWya5y_A,Jay M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place. I went here for a Yelp event and it was great. They have two storeys with a street level floor and a basement. The bar, as they say, has been modelled after the look of old times public bathroom in Paris. The basement may get a little crowded if there are anywhere more than 35-40 people as it has limited seating space. We tried a couple of cocktails and most of them were really amazing, especially the Rooftop Classic and Sherry Me. Special kudos to the bartenders who were great to watch as they conjured one cocktail after another. Great job with that as well as handling the volume of orders. We got to try their Yukon fries as well and they were great, especially with champagne. Definitely a great place for an evening hangout and enjoy a couple of drinks."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Club Pelicano is a very entertaining and interesting​ little Club/Bar in Montréal.I stumbled upon Club Pelicano during an impromptu​ crawl that just kind of happened after dinner at Le Serpente. It is an underground club both literally and figuratively that plays just about every type of music I enjoy and nothing I don't - plus the bartender, ownership, and staff are all very cool people. The interior is beyond​ unique​. As you walk down the stairs you realize you are entering the bottom of a swimming pool complete with old-school​ green tile, depth markers, lane lines... all of that. Add a fantastic mix of Craft Beer and Mixologist level drinks and you have everything you need to turn up an evening. The crowd is so varied it is hard to explain but I walked in with a suit and wingtips and felt perfectly at home. Perhaps that is the concept - a place for all. I usually hate nightclubs but Club Pelicano has me wondering if I have it all wrong. A must stop for anyone while in Montréal."

A week into the opening, I was blown away by the originality of this venue. A bath house themed bar! I can't swim so this swimming pool is perfect for me. The venue is an underground speakeasy kind of feel. Every single detail of this place down to the menu is piscined out. I tried three drinks that were relatively average (don't judge me- a good Friday night?!) Artist's special-12$ (3/5; sherry olorosso, glenmorangie, grenadine) this drink reminded me of breast cancer awareness with a cute bow; Tumbler #1 -12$ (3/5-rum, lime, sherry, Spicy Jamaican bitters, basilic thai)- a very tropical drink- and generous on the alcohol!; Frozen Papere Plane-9$ (5/5-whiskey rye, lemon, contratto, amaro) by far my favorite drink and the loveliest presentation with an actual paper plane! This drink was worth the buck compared to the other two.For food- you don't have many options, I wish I took a picture of the menu- but I had the bison tartare that was served with garlic and cheddar shavings I believe, don't quote me on this one (3/5- I thought the garlic was overpowering the bison's authentic taste-but presentation was down pact). The menu will be expanded on so stay tuned.The service was down pact- I have never seen bartenders put so much love into making a drink, true alchemy. Ask for Tamara!  From 6 to 9pm- the place is all ages, but as soon as the clock strikes 9pm, ppl start pouring in and the drunken bumping and grinding starts. I left. A cool note: there is a fortune teller in the back that looks creepy as hell but after a few drinks you should get your fortune read!.A solid win, I will be coming back here for sure, before bedtime-no bumpty bumpty in my book."

The street level restaurant was already closed, but the basement bar was bumpin.It wasn't super packed for 1am on a Friday night, but there was still a good crowd and the bar was full. We were able to snag some seats on the side and ordered a few drinks. They have some affordable cocktail choices, a frozen drink of the day, and beers. They were playing deep house beats that night, not sure if that's always the music genre of choice. We had a good time at the bar and would definitely come back for a chill night out, but just note their music is pretty loud!"

/user_details?userid=4TenUuWdhO7-bVNXRMVBpQ,Martin G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After a long conference day at Palais des Congrès, we were in dire need of booze. Luckily, a colleague had the foresight of making a reservation at Club Pelicano which is conveniently a few steps away from the Palais.Located in the basement right under Tiradito, this cute place felt like we were in a Miami club or something.Great cocktails, well balanced and not cheap on the alcohol content, and quite reasonably priced. In regards to the food I only had the tortillas with the guacamole (delicious and quite spicy), and the Mac and cheese rolls, fried, made with old cheddar and piave, and served with a mint chimichurri. Absolutely delicious. One colleague next to me had the mini calzones, he was a little less impressed.Service was great and efficient, not always a given when you're with a bigger group.The choice of music was great, with a mix of different styles for different tastes.All in all, a great place which I'll happily revisit whenever I can!"
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went here twice with friends. It's like a swimming pool without water. I thought the concept was pretty cool and different. Their drinks are good and very welcoming staff. I enjoyed the music a lot, both times I went here. My first trip was on a Saturday around 10 pm so it wasn't very busy. It got busier around 11 pm and the music got louder. The floor filled with the people dancing. Some of my friends didn't like it as they were not really in the mood for a club vibe. My second trip was on a Saturday as well but with a bigger group this time who were in the typical Saturday party mood. We got here around midnight and were able to get in quickly as there was no line. Enjoyed the music again. More people on the floor dancing. But the service was a bit slow, which is understandable because they were busier than my last trip. All in all, it's a nice place with good music and good service. Plus, it's really close to where I stay which is an added bonus for me!"

/user_details?userid=URsdPZv7GepnBZJufK_WKg,Nick L.,"Birmingham, AL",5 star rating,"An odd swimming pool themed club/bar with pretty solid drinks. Dont read French, got the postcard from Italy and it was amazing and strong. Very nice staff. Would have ordered food but no idea how the menu reads. Would come back!"
/user_details?userid=H2m2ODhf_TEimlsOe6ntyw,Robert O.,"Natick, MA",5 star rating,"Walk down stairs and jump in the pool. It's a great little bar. Excellent music, drinks and people. Great drink menu. I had the Missionary's Downfall and it was an amazing drink of white rum and resposado with a perfect name.  Highly recommend this spot for a quick drink or to hang all night."
/user_details?userid=TPY_Myg7qmBGAGbhAOHeHw,Eric T.,"Pittston, ME",5 star rating,Fun atmosphere with great drinks and friendly staff. Stopped in on a whim and we are happy with the choice!
/user_details?userid=24ucv-0GNoB2KazCY3NSGA,Diana L.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,This was the best choice I made in dining. The portions are on the smaller side but it's perfect for the bar setting. I recommend the BBQ duck sandwich. The interior is so well designed and the waiters are absolutely amazing! They are all conversational and efficient. The best bar/light food place in Montreal!
/user_details?userid=bG43PdXHMWU_6FNKMZByNg,Kai P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had a great first experience on Tuesday! We went there around 930pm there was a nice ambience with some relaxed & old school rap music playing, my friend had the OPA from Ghostfarm and I opted for the Missionaries Downfall ! YUMMMM!! A mix of fresh pineapple, mint, homemade peach shrub, white rum, tequila reposado and lime juice! Can you ask for much else? Look forward to passing by later in the week when they have DJ's mixing some Afro Funk or Italian Disco on vinyl's! Highly recommended"
/user_details?userid=Sp42UYEuooAF8xTesa86Dg,Justin A.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,This isn't so much a cocktail bar as it is a generic club made up to look like a cocktail bar. The drinks are sub-par and the music is so loud you can't have a conversation. If you're looking for well made cocktails - AVOID. I'd only recommend this place to someone looking to dance and drink a rum & coke.
/user_details?userid=FgjhIsN2G1H7xXJvs_cfUg,Melanie A.,"Downtown, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Cool spot!  I didn't take a look at the drunk menu as I just ordered a few vodka sodas when I went and my friend got beers, so while I can't comment on drinks, I can comment on the atmosphere. The live music was excellent and the ambiance was really fun."
