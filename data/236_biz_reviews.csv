Every time I pass that yellow bike parked in front of the resto, I'm tempted to get some pizza. I tried the Margherita Bianca this time and was not disappointed. So simple but so good. The crust and the buffalo mozzarella really hit the spot. They have takeout options but I really recommend dining inside. It's a tight space and they don't take reservations so it's better to go alone or with a smaller ensemble. With mirrors and glass displays, you can enjoy the live pizza making view from most angles of the restaurant. The servers were all very kind and attentive as well :)"
/user_details?userid=U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",4 star rating,"This became our late night snack spot every single night of our trip! What a gem 900 is. Located right next to the Omni (come out the Peel St. exit of Omni to easily access), it was so easy for us to walk on over and  grab ourselves a little personal pie. Every time (3 times) we went with the Margarita pie and it did not disappoint, nice thin crust, good flavor. We are fans! We'll miss our little late night journey to 900 for some pizza but if we're ever back in Montreal, we will be hitting up this spot again. Also, they make these pizzas SO fast. Literally never waited longer than 3 minutes."
/user_details?userid=FHawvX1EU2cFPWcM3Ppt0g,Rachael K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This pizza was really good I liked it the tomato sauce was light and fresh and the crust was light and pillowy. My only negative was the cheese was a little salty but that taste went away the next day when I ate it for lunch.  I would will definitely be going back!!!! I almost forgot to mention the price was awesome at $12 who could bet that.
/user_details?userid=VHx_sO7IxZvY3Hnf3-xq9Q,Nina Z.,"East Bay, CA",5 star rating,"First time trying neopolitan pizza. For those who don't know, neopolitan pizza is like thin crust, but with quality ingredients. Fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, ham, and mushrooms. It's not overly salty or doused in layers of melted cheese like American pizza. I especially enjoyed the accompanying spicy oil (so that's what fresh olive oil tastes like!).Service was attentive and professional. Our waiter seated us right away, took our orders in a timely manner, refilled our waters, and packed our leftover pizza slice for us. They have an open kitchen, so you can watch as they bake the pizza. I actually recommend sitting by the open window seating area, since it can get hot inside. Plus, you can enjoy people watching.Highly recommend checking this pizzeria out  if you're ever in the area."

Unfortunately, since it was freezing outside, by the time I arrived at my hotel, the pizza was cold, but who cares!? Pizza is always good, especially when you drench the crust in chili oil! The ratio of basil and cheese was to my liking and the portion size was generous... I am proud to admit I was able to eat the entire thing by myself.

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent pizza place with a great decor and ambiance. As I was craving for good pizza downtown during dinnertime, I decided on Pizzeria No 900 which was right around the corner of where I was. Having heard mixed reviews from friends about this place, I wanted to try it out myself to be the judge of it.The service was great. Me and my friend were seated quickly and the service was prompt as well. The ambiance was great as well with a great vibe for either a date or a group dinner as they offer larger tables as well. As for the food, I found that the pizza was good, with more simple flavors as their menu is fairly short compared to other Napolitanean pizza places. Don't let the scant choices fool you, the pizza is actually of great quality and well paired with a glass of wine.Overall, a great place if you wish to have good pizza and also catch up with friends."

Actually, it lacked flavor.We had ordered the proschuito pizza and added an egg with the pear and hazalnut salad.The salad was excellent. They were very generous with the goat cheese and my mouth was having a party with all the different flavors. The crust of the pizza was good, but I feel like the sauce was flavorless and there was not enough cheese on it. I can't say the pizza was bad, but definitely not worth the hype.We had also ordered cannolis and tiramisu for dessert which were really good.The decor is nice with bold colours, but the service was pretty bad. We constantly had to chase the waiter and it took long to receive our drinks and food.I would return for the salad and their dessert. I could have pizza elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I am always stunned to find a pizzeria no 900 in so many corners of Montreal. A franchise like Starbucks or Boustan. So finally, decided to try one of the resto. Actually, I was invited by my sister for lunch for my bday. We went to the one in downtown, on peel street. Nice spot. Beautiful inside like a diner style. The kitchen has an open concept, so you can see each person working, and how is your food cooked. It was really an enjoyable sight.For appetizers, we had Stracciata Di Burrata, which was a delight. My sister got spicy pancetta and fig pizza; she loved the combination of sweet and spicy. I took the porcini pizza with truffle oil, and sadly it was overdosed with the oil. Later on, I felt nauseated. Personally, I love truffle, I had similar pizzas at Bevo or Bacaro...it was exceptional. So I hope next time, as truffles are rare and delicate , the cook will be gentler with truffle oil on our food.I guess when it's a franchise, the uniqueness of the food would a miss."
/user_details?userid=2g5qp1_2_iGDJI7hPcC8TQ,Andrew M.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,Good Neapolitan style pizza -- though not quite as good as my favorite wood-fired place back home (this place uses a gas pizza oven).  Nice selection of red and white pizzas.  Caesar salad and arugula salads were both good as starters.  Fresh filled cannolis for dessert were outstanding!!
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I often take advantage of their great weekday lunch special. For $12, you get a pizza (Margherita, salami, or pizza of the day) and salad duo.On my most recent visit, I tried the pizza of the day, Porchetta and Olives w/ a white creamy sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed and found that the porchetta packed flavour and added an extra kick. The white sauce was also a pleasant non-conventional twist.I've also tried the Margherita and Salami pizza. Though classic and simple, the ingredients were fresh and you can't go wrong with either option.Does this restaurant fall within my top 5 pizza places in Montreal? Not exactly. However, for what you pay, it's a good meal and a pretty sweet deal!"

Decided to get food to go because inside was not kid friendly and we had our son with us. When we got back to hotel to eat the food we were so upset with the quality. First off the pizza was burnt on the bottom and barely had any cheese on it. What was more disgusting was the quality of the salad. The lettuce was already turning brown and has the nasty stickiness to it from being bad. We couldn't even eat it. Don't go here, not worth money or time!!!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a cool pizza spot!! It's trendy, right in downtown and very authentic. I came on a weekday for dinner and got seated right away. It's small, but they do have enough seating. I imagine this place gets busy on the weekends. Ordered a classic margherita pizza and it was delicious. They have plenty of other pizza choices well, everyone will be pleased here!  It was prepared in an authentic oven and has brilliant charcoal-ing. The cheese to sauce ratio was also perfect - not too heavy and not too stingy on the ingredients. The sauce was also nice. My friend who got just the marinara version appreciated the freshness of the ingredients as did I. The ambience was great too...full of charm and quirks. A bit on the smaller side in terms of seating but it was still comfortable. The music choice was a bit odd though (playing the billboard hits for a quaint Italian restaurant seemed odd to me). Nonetheless a nice pizza spot for a fine meal."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"FIRST REVIEW:The pizzas are solid and they have a very good $12 lunch deal. Normally I would have given them 3.5 stars but I had a bad service experience. Ordered the lunch special w the pizza of the day then had to wait approx 20-30 mins to get the pizza (that's fine - they're popular so I understand). The problem: they bring the wrong pizza! I'm on a tight timeline and am eating w my daughter so I can't wait another 20-30 mins to get the right one. Plus I'm hungry. So I reluctantly accept the wrong pizza - but explain it's ONLY because of my time constraint. Finish up, then ask for the bill. The NEXT problem: they make me wait ANOTHER 15-20 mins to pay!!! No addressing the wrong pizza mistake and just an insincere blurting of  ""sorry for the wait"" while looking elsewhere.For the first time in my adult life, I left no tip. First time.My hope is that this was a non-representative service experience... because it was BAD.Remark: If you go to this place for their lunch deal and want to save money, do not order a beverage. I had an Orangina type thing and it cost $4. Very nice margins for them. (Btw: there's nothing wrong w restos doing this... they optimize around a customers' limited attention. I'm just pointing this out for the benefit of customers who might actually be weird enough to read this review.)UPDATE:Went here again for lunch and had a much better experience (I'd call it 4.5 star experience). The service was punctual and everything was delivered as ordered. Very satisfied and - as I explained in my original review - P#900's lunch special is a great deal.My updated rating reflects an average of the first two experiences. If my next visit is as good as this second one, I'll write off the first visit as an idiosyncratic event (rather than a systematic one).Very pleased this time!"

We made a reservation which was a good idea considering the restaurant is pretty tiny. Though it was small, the restaurant is cozy with high tables and chairs, mirrored walls and a candle on every table. I initially wasn't really in the mood for pizza (ironic choice of restaurant eh) but my friend convinced me that it would be a crime to order a salad. I ended up ordering the plain cheese pizza (I forget the name in the menu). The pizzas we ordered all came out at the same time and all looked delicious. Mine looked so good, I couldn't wait to take a picture of it so the picture attached to this review is actually my friend's pizza.The ingredients used were high quality and my pizza was cooked perfectly. A few of my friends found their crust to be over cooked but mine was perfect. The spicy oil they serve is excellent!Our waiter was friendly and attentive and was quick.

/user_details?userid=XP8PzCFQJvR1eRChwgn2Bg,Kyla C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Went to this place on my last night in Montreal. I kept passing by it on my daily ventures to the city from my hotel and there was always something that intrigued me about it. It reminded of those trendy places that line Queen West in Toronto. After the previous place I'd been wanting to go to was full for the night I decided this would be a good opportunity to stop by. The place is small, so I wouldn't recommend it for groups of 4 or more. We were greeted by a friendly host who brought us to our table and were immediately met with our waiter. The establishment seems to be run by young 20-something's so it's definitely a ""cool"" vibe. He ran us through the drinks menu and then gave us a chance to look it over. We ordered the arugula salad and the charcuterie board to start. The arugula salad was garnished with some ricotta cheese which was a nice touch. The charcuterie board was neatly presented and included: prosciutto, salami, fior di latte, olives and artichokes. We were also given bread for the table. Both starters were amazing and a nice way to start off the meal. I love charcuterie boards so this was a definite hit in my books! The pizza's are cut into quarters and about the size of a regular dinner plate, if you're hungry I would suggest ordering your own rather than sharing (and if you happen to have leftovers... who doesn't love leftover pizza?). We ordered the Margherita and the Mild Italian Sausage pizza's. Both were absolutely amazing! The crust was perfectly crispy on the edges, the middle of the slices not drooping, being unable to sustain the toppings. They also gave chilli oil do drizzle on the pizza's elevating the heat levels. This is great if you're sharing pizza's and some people aren't too fond of spice. One of the things that i really enjoyed about this place was that the dining room and kitchen were within close proximity of each other. No matter where you were seated you had a great view of the pizza's being made, the wood oven heat radiating throughout. This added a sense of warmth to the place.    For dessert we ordered the Nutella pizza, the tiramisu and cappuccino's. ALL WERE AMAZING!!! I'd definitely recommend this place! Amazing atmosphere. Amazing pizza's. Amazing service."

I absolutely love this cute little pizzeria, they have the kindest staff and I love watching my pizza being made. They use fresh, and quality ingredients (ooh the cheese ) My personal favorite is the mild Italian sausage pizza and the margarita pizza. I could have them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I highly recommend this place to everyone and don't think twice- just order the cannoli, it's worth the calories."

Even though there aren't big tables that easily seat larger groups, the staff easily accommodated us by pushing a few of the small tables together. Service was fast and attentive - I never ran out of water. It was a Friday, so I thought the restaurant would have more people, but it also felt like -30° outside, so I wasn't too surprised. Still, there were a few other groups there, so I imagine it gets pretty busy on regular days. I ordered the lunch special with arugula salad and Margherita pizza. My friends got the antipasti board, which looked good, but I didn't try any. Great value for the amount of food. The coffee was great (and well priced) too.

As soon as my husband finished his beer, they asked if he wanted another one.  And as soon as our waters were running low, they refilled them.  The place gets really warm due to the pizza oven, so dress appropriately.  I would not want to be in a wool sweater or a turtleneck or anything like that in the restaurant!  The washrooms are cool.  They have 3 universal/unisex water closets with just a toilet, then there is a communal area with a sink.   If you like pizza and especially Neapolitan style pizza, you should definitely check this place out."

Street parking is available but metered and the closest subway is Peel (green line). If you go on a weekend, it will be tough to find street parking.The place: It's pretty small and the kitchen, including the giant wood burning oven, is in the main dining space so it can get a little warm.The goods: Frankly, I don't get the high ratings for this place. I went on a Tuesday with 6 friends and we each ordered pizza. I got the Italian sausage pizza with Fior di latte, green onions, romano cheese and pesto. First of all, there was the equivalent of about half a sausage on my pizza - in fact, I counted 6 pieces. There wasn't much mozza and I couldn't taste any of the Romano that was allegedly on this pizza. Green onions? Where? To say that they're cheap on toppings is an understatement - they seem to count exactly what they put on their pizzas. My friends all experienced the same thing but hey - the one topping 900 is generous with is arugula! Because that's why we eat pizza - the greens! In terms of taste, my pizza was OK but the crust tasted a little burnt. My friends thought their pizzas were OK too, but this place didn't blow them away. The reality is that 900 doesn't serve the best pizza in town. If you want great pizza then check out Anton & James or Santa Lucia, which are both about a block away.  Service: The fellow who greeted us was very friendly and he seated us almost immediately. That said, the waitress was all about the attitude and left us with the distinct feeling that we were bothering her. We had the same impression from the bearded guy in the Hawaiian shirt who we presumed was the manager. Tip: If you don't like customer service then maybe you should change jobs - you're not doing us any favors by gracing the culinary world with your surly presence. Price point: The average price for pizza is between $11-$15 - which would be fair if the pizzas actually had toppings and the staff didn't dole out attitude. Go elsewhere."

I placed my order and it arrived in 10-12 minutes from the wood fire oven.My pizza was delicious and having their chilli oil on the side just added the right kick! The pizza was thin crust and the outside well cooked and full of fresh flavours. I would definitely return and try their other pizzas on the menu. My server was friendly and nice!

Would anything ever come close to the magic I experienced in the motherland of pizza? Pizzeria No. 900 Napolitaine does a pretty good job! In good pizza, the crust should be thin, chewy (but not too chewy), burnt appropriately for the bitterness and smokiness to counter the rich acidity of the tomato and other ingredients. My pizza definitely had all the hallmarks of good dough. The ingredients were also super flavourful and I enjoyed the combination of the pizza I ordered. I ordered the mild Italian sausage one, which was tomato based with pesto, green onion, peppers, and cheese. Service was also super quick and very friendly.

I mean, honestly, the pizza dough itself is good -- wood fired oven, soft dough-y perfection, but the toppings are where they fell flat.They were pretty stingy with the basil leaves, the cheese.. I honestly think that it should have had at least double the toppings on there because even for $11, I am not expecting 4 little leaves of basil on a pizza.I would come back. Don't get me wrong, I would eat here again as a quick snack, but it is mostly really good, delicious, pizza dough bread with a slight smear of toppings. I would have needed two to be full."

It looked beautiful from the outside, so we decided to try it for dinner. Although it rained sporadically all afternoon today, we managed to avoid the downpours and secure our seats less than 10 minutes after arrival. Pizzéria No. 900 doesn't take reservations - which I guess goes into the idea of a ""neighoughood pizzeria"" - so it can be a bit annoying if you're not ready to stand in line.The restaurant has perhaps ~30-35 seats. Its not big, but perfectly arranged and decorated. The white subway tile walls and patterned floors are simple and clean, giving an aerated look to the otherwise small restaurant. Inside, a mirrored wall further expands the space. Combined with the beautiful wooden tables and glass shelves, the whole place looks luminous and welcoming.We took advantage of the waiting time to decide on our orders. I strongly recommend the burrata, especially if you're a cheese monster like me. Every item on that wooden board was praise-worthy. The taste of the sun-soaked cherry tomatoes was enhanced by fresh parsley and olive oil. The olives (castelvetrano?) were mild and meaty. The pesto fragrant and beautiful in color. The cheese itself was of course wonderful: creamy, rich and fresh all at the same time. Upon his first bite, my boyfriend decided on the spot that he would come back just for burrata - everyday single day - for a whole week! His mild Italian sausage pizza came soon after. To me, they apologized and said they were re-making my spicy pancetta and figs pizza, as it was apparently overcooked. It came merely 2 minutes later, which shows how important customer service is to Pizzéria No. 900. I have to admit that the pizzas were less impressive than the burrata, but still delicious. The outer crust had all those delightful imperfections and blisters, and the center was just thin enough to hold its own. I was actually surprised to see my boyfriend finish all of his crusts - he normally refuses to eat them. He explained that it was ""different"" this time (lol).In the meantime, rain was coming down again, so we decided to stay for dessert. Since cannolis were not available, we opted for coffee. And so, we spent the last 20 minutes of this hour and a half-long dinner happily sipping (great) coffee while watching the rain fall outside the large open windows. Such a relaxing time!I think the greatest strength of Pizzéria No. 900 comes from the quality of their products, and the attention they give to details, whether it concerns the food, setting, or service. Seriously, it's worth a visit.  Tip: If the restaurant is packed and you don't feel like waiting, consider ordering for take-out. You will be out of there pizza in hand in much less time."
/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went there for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the technique put into the pizza. I ordered a lunch special, which was a Margherita pizza and a Ceasar salad. The Margherita, being the absolute benchmark of a pizza-maker, was delicious. A crispy, yet slightly elastic crust, the perfect amount of flavour and acidity in the sauce, a good balance between the texture of the fior di latte and the parmesan, and an amazing spicy olive oil. The only weak point is I actually enjoy my pizza with a bit more basil, but this could be easily fixed with an add-on. The crowd is mostly office workers, service was efficient, yet courteous, and prices are more than reasonable.Oh and the salad was great too, but who cares about the salad right ;)."

Was a pizza Bianca (no tomato sauce) but didn't say so on the menu, it didn't nearly have enough toppings for the size and the dough was burnt. So most bites were plain burnt dough with a bit of arugula leaves. Also the waiter wouldn't bring us our bill, probably hoping we would order drinks, and took another 30min to make us pay. Will never go back."

I thought Brigade was ""it"" downtown but this is even better! I'm amazed it's a chain, but whoever is behind it is onto something good. If that means people all over Montreal get to experience some most excellent pizza, that can only be a good thing.So the pizza. Oh the pizza! This pizza rivals some of my fondest memories of eating pizza in Italy (and no, not all of it was amazing there either). The perfect thin crust, but still a bit doughy at the edges. Enough toppings, but too much. Just right. I had a four cheese pizza (that day's pizza of the day) and it was delicious and the didn't skimp on the cheese, but there also wasn't so much that I felt ill afterwards (it has happened elsewhere). I found the price reasonable, especially the lunch special at $12. By no means a cheap lunch, but if you want to go out and eat a delicious sit down meal, it's perfectly acceptable. The space itself is gorgeous. Lots of wood and light, and people crammed everywhere. There's a window counter for people watching while dining. The kitchen is right there and open, so you can watch the pizzas being skillfully prepared while you wait. It looked like they were working on an adjacent space that will add more seating, a welcome addition as most lunch hours there is a steady lineup of people waiting for takeout or to be seated."

We were rapidly seated at a counter for drinks and moved to a table minutes afterwards. Ordered the Margarita (9$) and Salami (11$) pizzas, both were delicious. Crispy crust, fresh toppings. Also had their Aperol spritz, which was decently priced also and well balanced. Finished off with their Nutella pizza. Man that thing is decadent.

It's really nice though small so I imagine it could get busy, though it wasn't like that when we went for a midweek dinner around 18. Considering it's location it draws a mostly tourist and suits crowd but it was nice and the staff was all very attentive and helpful. Both the pizzas we had were really good, I had a mushroom and prosciutto calzone style pizza topped with arugula that I would happily have again.

Stopped by three times in the week I was staying at the Residence Inn next door and that alone says how much I liked it, because I don't like to repeat restaurants while traveling. I got a pizza to go all three times and literally waited no more than five minutes each time. The reasons for the four stars instead of five is if you do order to go and wait, the only place to really wait is right in front of the door or on a lone bar stool next to the door (so if there is more than one person waiting, you are basically standing next to someone's table). This is such a small complaint though. The slight inconvenience of waiting is far outweighed by the awesome pizza."

/user_details?userid=X3nRtVpJ855MCRM9pcpnmg,Andy G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Came here on a quiet Sunday evening. The ambience and lighting were pleasant enough. The combinations of ingredients on the pizza were interesting, to say the least. I can't say I'm ever really pleased to have just roughly chopped raw romaine lettuce sprinkled on top of my speck pizza, which, as I was reminded by my gracious server, was smoked prosciutto. My partner and I were also perplexed by the giant chunks of jalapeno and green onion (?) on the mild Italian sausage pizza: if it's meant to be mild, then why spice it up anyway? I suppose I should commend them on cooking their pizza all the way through (here's looking at you, neighbouring competitor who shan't be named), but I would've liked a denser, more burnt crust. Both pizzas could have definitely used more of their actual namesake toppings on top of them, but that's just me. Also, it is kind of a turn-off when the waiter reminds you that the tip isn't included in your bill at the end of your meal... Overall, I've had better for the price range, gratuity or no (once again, looking at you unnamed neighbouring competitor)."

The buratta was decent, but the serving is small. The pizza was ok, too much lettuce. It's like having a plain salad on your pizza. I actually didn't realize it had lettuce when I ordered, I thought it was a classic prosciutto and arugula pizza, but it's lettuce. So it's odd having the bland crunchy salad on a perfectly fine pizza. The place is kind of cute. I was on a work trip in my downtime, so i sat alone facing the street. Convenient."

/user_details?userid=prvMQxyRsLMZUTBOzIhTpw,William C.,"Fort Worth, TX",5 star rating,"So I went there for dinner a few nights ago and so far it has been the best experience eating here in Montreal. The food was also fabulous. The waitress was super friendly, and the food was good. Definitely a place I would recommend anyone check out."

Despite it being incredibly busy for a Monday, the staff was very friendly and accommodating of my special needs daughter. I had the prosciutto, which was excellent. My wife had the spicy pancetta and figs. Very good."
