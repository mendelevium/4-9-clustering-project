/user_details?userid=TPRke-y79fb3MO6StDHXaQ,Alice W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Came here last year around February for a long weekend trip to Montreal. I was looking for a quick breakfast and coffee spot to start the day, stumbled upon this spot on Instagram as a recommendation.The front of the cafe was so unique, big marble door steps that lead up to the entrance. Walking in, I was really impressed by the decor here. There's alot of very gothic designs painted in white and plants hanging everywhere, so pretty! My friend and I each got a coffee and a pastry. I got the chocolate scone and she got the almond croissant. For drinks, we each got a specialty drink.The food- the scone was really yummy, with dark chocolate so not overwhelmingly sweet. The croissant was very soft and covered with plenty of almonds. I like that they give the food to you on a cute green and white checkered piece of paper and served on a white porcelain plate.The coffees- these were so beautiful and yummy, they look like they could be hung up as art. I love places that give you a little design on your coffee foam, mine had a very pretty heart on it! I also like that you can see the layers of the coffee. The coffee shop is pretty crowded so I would recommend scoping out for a seat as soon as you walk in, but the food and coffee here is great!!"

I absolutey love that they are opened again :) their service is great and their places are aaalways super cute! We got mimosas and the Truffle Omelette and it was divine :) I also got their prociutto grilled cheese in the past and its also a great pick :) I really like the ambiance, chill music, open windows and the oldmport view! Definitely stop by if you are around :D"

It is so cute to plants all around the cafe like this. After a walk around town in the summer, I was thirsty and found this place. So beautiful. Besides coffee, they also serve croissants and pastries. Every corner is absolutely clean and organized. There are books if you go by yourself and want to have some quiet time. There are a few water stations around the place for customers who want to grab a sip of water with their coffees. Small flower vases are found throughout the store. If I were a resident in this city, this cafe will absolutely be my favorite place to go to!Highlights of the menu:1. Matcha latte2. Hot chocolate"

It does get very very hot in there. Maybe it was just me. We ordered:Breakfast croissantChocolate danishAlmond danishSomething like a donut (sorry don't know the name) Classic avotoast w/ prosciuttoClassic avotoast w/ salmon And a few drinksWe sat on the second floor it's such a pretty little brunch spot. Definitely recommend. But we didn't stay too long as we all started to feel too hot."
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Friendly barista,Decent menu, had an avocado toast, a little over priced but good none the less.  Always a long line up, really nice decor, tons of plants and cute Knick knacks around the cafe. Not a crazy amount of seating at this location but we found there a quick turn over. This location gets lots of sun light which is really nice."
/user_details?userid=lhrleFTsOw91vEUY1s871A,Morgan H.,"Fairfax, VA",5 star rating,"Wow so glad I tried this on our last morning in Montreal. We were looking for a place in the Old Port area that had traditional Montreal style bagels. This little cafe is adorable with lots of plants windows and a full coffee bar. We came during on a Sunday morning and had no issue finding a seat. There were a couple of things on the menu that appealed (avocado toast, salad) but I opted for the lox bagel and drip coffee.This was phenomenal and may even be the best lox I've had. The bagel was thinner a bit crispier and overall more flavorful than those in the US. I loved that it came deconstructed so I could add ingredients as I needed. I am not sure what was in the cream cheese, but it was very thin,  light and overall delicious; it almost tasted like creme fraiche. The capers, thin slices of salmon and pickled onions were just perfect complements to the  each other. I left feeling completely satisfied and not overstuffed. Between the food and nice atmosphere, I wish I had discovered this place sooner."
/user_details?userid=nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,Bonnie C.,"Newton, MA",4 star rating,"For some reason I had high expectations for this establishment just because I heard that it gets crazy busy here. I am hovering between 3 to 4 stars. First to make it clear, this location is order and then get seated type of cafe, whereas the one further down the street is sit down and get waited on cafe. The difference is that the other one opens an hour later than this location, which we had no idea. We came here around 9am on a Sunday and the lines weren't long at all (at the top of the steps) and there were still some seating available. It is pretty tiny in here and will get claustrophobic - I do not know how one maneuvers through here during peak hours. It was not even busy and it was hard to move around already. The menu did not pique my interest, but for the sake of it, I ordered the avocado toast.I have got to say that this was one of the best avocado toasts I've ever had! This is worth ordering, especially with that egg on top. I ordered a cappuccino as well. Apparently you are supposed to grab the drinks first and then find a seat - it does not come with your meal when the staff brings over the food for you. Because of this, our drinks got cold and the staff was friendly enough to offer us a second cup before we left. The coffee is pretty strong, which is why this place deserves a 4 star. It is so rare for me to get wired like the way I did with this cappuccino. Highly recommend.Overall, this is a cute cafe but certainly not the most relaxing. Almost felt claustrophobic. If I come back to Montreal, I definitely want to try the other location so I can sit down and enjoy my meal. I believe they have a more extensive menu. If I am in a rush, I'd come back here to get a nice cup of cappuccino to wake sleepy me up."
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Montreal has some of the most beautiful cafes in the world and Tommy is definitely up there when it comes to aesthetics. From the beautiful collection of plants to the classic crown moulding to the irregular furniture, everything works together to create a hip and cozy space. It is here at Tommy where I first tried the glorious, deep fried, artery-clogging CRONUT. SooOoooOOoOo good. (One star off because everything is slightly overpriced)"
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Tommy Cafe is a beautiful three-level cafe in a corner historic building in the heart of Old Montreal. It's very popular so many people get their food to go, but if you can snag a table or couch, it's worth to dine in. The hanging plants and natural light create a peaceful environment. The menu itself is small compared to other nearby cafes. They have coffee, pastries, a few cocktails, and avo toast (they give you an option to add an egg).I ordered their ""Summer 19"" cocktail. If you like sweeter, light cocktails, get it. I felt so refreshed afterwards.My nutella cronut was the first cronut I enjoyed. My avo toast was big and came with a side green salad. It was a simple avo toast and good, but not worth the price.If you pick cafes based on looks, this one is very good-looking."
/user_details?userid=LKaEiBYGBnB8Df1hUyEnLA,Carol L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The decor of my dreams, a delicious hot creamy latte, and curled up on a cold day with a dear friend.. Perfect place to spend any afternoon or morning. Didn't get a chance to try the food, but the coffee here was delicious."
/user_details?userid=gEtdFQBqJXj0MgPtANGisw,Mitch J.,"Rockford, IL",4 star rating,"Wow this place is great! The atmosphere here is the first thing that drew me in. Very white and clean, with brown wood tones and plants everywhere. A very unique mixture of modern and old fashioned that works super well. The second thing about this place I noticed were the very friendly and smiley staff. They were very nice and I didn't feel rushed whatsoever. They answered my questions politely and patiently. They also spoke great English!I got the oat milk chai latte and my wife got the vanilla latte--both were excellent, I just wished my chai latte was less sweet. I personally like them unsweetened and this one is definitely not that. However, I do love that they have several non-dairy milk options.My only comment would be I come to coffee shops more to work than relax, so I'd love more outlets. There were not many available at all. But if you come here for pleasure, you'll love it."

Tommy's pastries are pretty incredible, and it's got an adorable plant-filled aesthetic that I love, but I can NEVER get a seat in here.There are so many other cafés nearby that also never have seating because people camp out all day with their laptops! I wish that there was a rule about this because it really ruins a good café."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the classic instagram cafes of Montreal. Located near Crew cafe, this cafe is much much smaller so expect to wait a bit to find a seat if you decide to go during peak times/a sunny day. This isn't really the kind of cafe that I like to go to when I want to study because it is quite crowded all the time and they don't have many tables near plugs to charge your electronics. The pastries are really good, I got the nutella doughnut and it was delicious. The drinks are quite ordinary."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A friend from Old Port recommended this spot and I'm so glad she did! I fell in love with the interior, food and service!! I looked up on Yelp to decide what to order based on the reviews. Ended up getting a Mimosa and the Greek Avocado Bread. It was a great decision!! The taste of the Avocado & Bread, Chilli Flakes, Salt, Cheese, Onions, Cherry Tomatoes and lime worked so well together!! I am really excited and happy to have found this spot and will return very soon!! Would definitely recommend if in the area, otherwise make the trip to Tommy because it's definitely worth it!"
/user_details?userid=cbzM6kE426dOaTvj9NPqww,Jonathan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"This place is the best. Summer in Montreal is a muddy humid mess, so to my surprise that I found this cool cafe where I can get a nice cup of Joe and cool myself off. Located near the Notre-Dame cathedral, this cafe is absolutely relaxing indoors, even with the continuous crowds that pass on through. They had WiFi, outlets, air conditioner, and seating for you to people watch as they walk by. I ordered myself an iced mocha and it comes in their signature metal mugs. I'm clumsy. Yes, I was nervous carrying my drink up the stairs, but if I can manage then you'll manage as well. I will stop by again in the future if I'm ever in the area. Thanks Tommy for the recharge and the cool down with the aircon."

/user_details?userid=6q8abQplnKKl51KuwlExug,Karan N.,"St. John's, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was amazing at this small cafe. We ordered the lox bagel, grilled cheese, an Americanism and latte. The food was 10/10. Something I've noticed in Montreal is the staff at restaurants are a little arrogant to tourists, mainly if don't speak French. The reason I'm giving a 4-star review is that they seemed a little annoyed we asked for condiments with our meal, and because we were tourists. It sucks when the experience is ruined by staff that are not overly friendly."
/user_details?userid=KQSRUu4Aapl0hG6eu2v8iw,Lizzie S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"I think most of Tommy's patrons come there for one of a few reasons. I came for the coffee and for Instagramming the plants on the ceiling as well as the building: I love the style, it reminds me of a newspaper building from an old-fashioned movie! The interior is also extremely cute--there's tall, winding steps in the center, more plants that aren't just hanging from the towering ceiling, bright and open space with lots of windows, and large mirrors that make the space look huge. I walked up the steps to check how big the space was and realized it was an illusion and felt a tad bit silly. Oh well!This is located kind-of near Chinatown, and I made the trek in the snow from the Theatre St. James to order the matcha latte and a Nutella cronut. The cronut was baked to perfection and had just the right balance of Nutella and butter. Come for the food and the 'gram."
/user_details?userid=Wl1dBsP9cShaPQOMwGhM_Q,Jesse M.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",4 star rating,Reall cool cafe. Their Nutella donuts are insanely good. Their mocha coffee is amazing as well and so is their hot chocolate. They have a few locations in old Montreal. Definitely a spot to warm up and get some coffee or tea.
/user_details?userid=QxyH3kOJMTVARsU1dUrIUg,Tiffany Y.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Come here at around 3pm and there are already a lot of people, even on the weekdays. But the environment is not so noisy, and with the charger and free wifi, it's definitely a good place for work and study.I ordered the chai latte with almond milk and it's really good. But the food is not what i want since it's cold and hard. One coffee and one food cost me around $10, which i think it a little overpriced according to its taste. Maybe i should try another kind of food next time:)"
/user_details?userid=jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,Ali A.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,"We were looking for a cool Café to spend a few hours and we came across this place in old Montréal. We tried the hot chocolate and the latte, both good! The great point is that unlike franchises here you don't get paper cups. Old fashioned durable glass cups instead!On a cold winter Sunday, parking was easy. We waited few minutes to have a free table though! Prices were fair, staff polite, ambiance nice."
/user_details?userid=wmXYo8UbPon5woxlOvVptA,Vanessa H.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",4 star rating,"Get coffee here. The ambience is beautiful! This cafe is such a nice space to do work or hangout with friends. It's very open with beautiful architecture on the inside. The coffee and drinks are very delicious. That is definitely worth your money.For breakfast food, the avocado toast with tomato was 10$, a bit steep for what it is. The breakfast sandwich was also around that price. The food was good, but probably not worth paying that much."
/user_details?userid=7wrPUBr_xc7NHvuPMKiRjQ,Nurjahan B.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Omgggg such a CUTE place I love the chill atmosphere and the gorgeous plants they had all over the place !! It's super comfortable but the only downside is that it got filled up pretty quickly so I would recommend going early. I got a hit chocolate made with oat milk and it was really good and they made a little cute art on the top which I loveeee considering I'm a barista myself too!! My friend got a chai latte which was gorgeous and she told me it tasted good !! I didn't get the food unfortunately but they all looked super tasty :) the workers there are super nice too and they were helpful when I asked a couple of questions since it was my first time there !! Their menu isn't too extensive so u don't have to think a lot ahaha anyways I really recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet place to do your work or just hang out with your friends !!!!
/user_details?userid=NZMcnwHhSNqDjUdABIeUcg,Nicole L.,"Gatineau, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute, crowded and busy.Nice old architecture, a lot of white paint, plants and beautiful big old windows with unique multi-level seating.I particularly like the retro living room decor that has a table containing old encyclopedias with a Virgin Mary and a globe on top.I couldn't help notice they allow dogs and I think that is terrific.  I wish more places would do the same.Husband had the pecan tart and swears it's the best he's ever had.  We also bought some chocolate croissants that were excellent.Oh, I almost forgot, their coffee is wonderful!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is my first time at the original location for Tommy. It has a French allure to it-with fresh greens, flowers and a glass pastry display. I came here after work around 6 pm. The café is a split level with three floors. You won't have trouble finding a space go sit but good luck if you want to plug in your laptop. Most of the outlets are located in the upper floor. I thought the mix and match furniture was creative but the sofas on the top floor looked run down - not very clean. There are two bathroom with very poor lighting and a common washing area.I paid 13$ for a croissant and a fresh pineapple coconut  juice. It was refreshing but not for its 8$ price. My croissant was stale, which makes senses if it's out in the open. Overall, I think I would come back here for the change of work environment for that once in a while as it is in the heart of old Montreal. It's nice to be a tourist in your own city. I prefer the second location on St. Paul."
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has been on my list for months. I finally got a chance to visit this cute cafe in the old port. The entrance is beautiful. The cafe is 2 floors with stunning architecture and designs in white spectrum along with plants everywhere. I loved the decor of this cafe. However, it's very compact with tables, chairs and couches; almost claustrophobic. They do have free wifi. They also have water in beautiful bottles with glasses sitting in corners of the place. This isn't a quiet cafe, if that's what you're looking for. It's a good place to have group meetings and socialize. I ordered a ice coffee and a grilled cheese sandwich which came up to $17. It's a little high in price but this is the old port. You grab a table number and find a table. One of the servers will bring the food to you. I this it's cute because in the meantime you're getting comfortable wherever you are sitting. I loved my salad, the dressing was great. There are other baked goodies, doughnuts and food you can order. I really liked this place and would definitely go again."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ugh... Instagram made me!!Had this café on my bucket list for ages after seeing all the attractive pictures all over Instagram. Being a sucker for gorgeous interiors, especially old/historic buildings converted into modern coffee shops, Tommy was at the top of my list. From a distance, the coffee shop stands out with its stunning corner-elevation of beautiful Victorian Architecture. However, I was a little disappointed upon entering. The space is much smaller than I anticipated and a lot of seating has been crammed into this space. I do love the play of levels with mezzanines which works well and appreciate the relaxed atmosphere however, being popular with both tourists and locals, it can get really claustrophobic waiting in such a small space. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you get a seat during weekends/peak times as people don't seem to want to move from there.The décor definitely is one of its main features for those picture-perfect Instagram shots as the café is bright and flooded with natural light. The hanging foliage, chandelier and ornate mouldings on the ceiling and walls create the ideal dream backdrop. It is a shame therefore that I cannot say the same for the coffee/snacks. I had the honey-glazed mushroom and goat cheese toast with a mocha and the raved-about 'cronut' which were all disappointing and extremely over-priced. It cost around 25$ for the 3 items - none of which were worth it.Overall, a stunning café worth visiting for the pictures but for a bite, there are plenty of better options in the area where you are sure to get more than a meagre $14 toast."
/user_details?userid=DVevJSUXRG1ddLxHrsTtRw,Michelle C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"One of my favorite cafes. And I love frequenting cafes. When you walk up the stairs and into the space, you instantly notice the large ""chandelier"" of hanging planters coming down from the two-story cafe. If you love greenery like me, you'll love this place. It's a loft-space with a first floor, a ""mid-floor"" space with seating and a second floor with seating and bathrooms. They serve all your usual espresso and cafe drinks, brunch items (get the avo toast with lox/prosciutto!), and bakery items (try the cronut!!). Also worth noting; this review is just for this location. I've been to their new location in the midst of Old Montreal and the setup is not nearly as good and it's far too packed."
/user_details?userid=VO5CusoWMSr-29B0mUgAeA,Kim S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"LOVE this place. They have so many live plants and cute decorations that makes this place unique also blended in this little French city. The mirror definitely makes this place twice bigger than it is. I was pleased to know that they have many kinds of alternative non-diary milk to choose from. The chai latte that I got was pretty good. They also have bagels that seems to be a popular item on the menu. One block away, there is another tommy has more options also serves regular meals. This one focuses more on light meals and drinks. They also offer WiFi which was a huge plus! I don't have any data when I travel, so I utilize WiFi whenever I can. I enjoyed this place and highly recommend to anyone who is in this city to check it out."

/user_details?userid=rFR3fyOU1MSyIRcb6oiRmQ,Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4 star rating,"A good breakfast place! A little on the pricey side. We spent about $30 on 2 toasts and a latte. I ordered the sweet toast with glazed peaches, goat cheese, and honey and my husband ordered the more savory avocado toast. Heads up, you have to pay extra for any other toppings other than avocado.The location we went to was pretty small. It was a little difficult to find a table but we did manage to snag one after waiting for some people to leave. But most people there had their laptops and looked like they were planning on spending all day there.My toast was good but I was still pretty hungry after. I don't think it was worth the price. It was unique, though. A popular item on the menu that we saw everyone else order was the croissant breakfast sandwich with egg and other toppings. It looked very filling so I think that should be the item to order if you come visit!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a really great spot in old Montreal for coffee, brunch, desserts, or just if you want to chill. Situated right near the Notre Dame is Tommy - a cool, hip  cafe with soaring ceilings and very aesthetic plants. They have a small menu but they'll definitely be something for everyone - from their kronut to their avocado toasts to their ice lattes - you'll definitely find something you enjoy. If you're in a hurry you can get takeout, but it's a really nice atmosphere to sit in. I've been multiple times and have had various things - but their baked goods are quite good I have to say. This is one of that fewer places which has matcha lattes in Montreal (matcha presence is slowly growing), so I had to get an iced matcha latte here. I also tried the brioche and kronut...The latte was not overly sweet and good quality matcha...and the brioche was very tasty! I'd definitely recommend this cafe when visiting old Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"What a fabulous little café! Really gorgeous refurbishment of a beautiful old building - what is it? A former bank? The foliate woodwork around the ceiling is accented by a massive chandelier of leafy vine plants hanging over the main interior. Multiple levels give you plenty of gawk-space for people watching, and people-watching you will do! Excellent vintage blues playlist and delicious espresso. Tattooed beauties of all genders are the prominent feature amongst the clientele. Also, can it get more hipster than AVOCADO TOAST? Seriously, though, we were super happy to find this spot, open early, right in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Revved on a double shot, I'm inspired to go get more ink, like, today!"
/user_details?userid=auwAFGxbeisZ1DYLyS8Vag,Patricia V.,"Elmhurst, NY",5 star rating,The breakfast croissant was amazing.

/user_details?userid=-1wbglcr6x1qrUbqP1YAIA,Kimmy N.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"I was looking for a good breakfast place when I was in Montreal. This is definitely one of my favourites!I usually don't eat a lot for breakfast. A cup of coffee or tea, and a little snack will do.According to the reviews, the 'cado toast is definitely something you need to order. So I did just that! I had a chai latte and brought it to my seat. The chai latte was pretty good. I liked the cinnamon on top. A few minutes later, the avocado toast graced my table. It was bigger than i thought, which was great! Considering you can get a smaller piece of avocado toast in Toronto for the same price (or even more!), this was a steal. My plate was taken up by most of the toast. It had sesame seeds that provided a little crunch and texture. The bread was soft but toasted. The avocado was creamy and fresh. The flavour was extraordinary. Listen, you can make a really crappy avocado toast or a really good one. This was the best. The crushed red pepper flakes and the salt made it perfect. The lemon wedges and rosemary (?) on the side was delicious. The lemon cut the creaminess. And the olive oil brought out the creaminess in the avocado. The service was delightful. The atmosphere was amazing! High ceilings, rustic furniture, sofas, many designated seating areas, and plants + flowers made it a great experience. Truly relaxing."

They ran out of croissants after our group ordered 4 breakfast croissant sandwiches and notified us of the issue 15 minutes after ordering. 10 minutes later the server came back and told us more croissants just arrived, so we all ended up getting the croissants (instead of a bagel substitute). We waited a total of maybe ~30-40 minutes for our food. Nevertheless the sandwich itself was delicious and they were very accommodating with food substitutions. Tre vegan maple cake is delicious!The interior of the café is really cute and instagram-able, and the servers were friendly/very apologetic even though the shortage of croissants was not their fault!"

The upstairs was full so we sat by the window, it was a cold day and it was nice to see the outside world from the inside! The ambiance is really country cute and is a very polite and sweet vibe. Sorta reminds me of playing ""tea time"" when you were a kid. I thought it was very cute, and it is a quiet coffee shop. The pastries were flaky and very tasty and the staff was very polite. I enjoy the coffee mugs they give you as well and I think this is up there in coffee shops in Montreal. I would certainly make a stop here! In a great location of old town too!"
/user_details?userid=DPcJ_uf07HgSP-f-noeV_g,V T.,"Springfield, VA",5 star rating,"Came here on a Friday morning around 11am. It was quite busy and difficult to find a table but we were able to seat ourselves. I can't imagine how busy it is on the actual weekend. The ambiance here is adorable and really the high point. Lush greenery with vines hanging from all over the ceiling, as the yelp gallery suggests. I will say the music is all over the place, from mellow hiphop to pop to just flat out locally-sourced Cirque du Soleil soundtrack. *Bagel with salmon, cream cheese: This was presented in a ""deconstructed"" manner which was beautiful. I should've asked them if they got their bagels from St-Viateur or from Fairmont (or maybe neither?), but either way the bagel was top notch classic Montreal style. Good amount of fixins (capers, lox and cream cheese). *Almond croissant: Light, doughy on the inside yet crispy on the outside, perfectly baked.Located just down the street from Notre-Dame Cathedral, this place is an ideal stop to include while wandering Old Montreal, and just soak up the vibe of this vibrant cultured city. And if you're an Instagrammer or an avocado-toast junkie, this is definitely the place for you."

Looked at the reviews and it looked really good... the thing is that I was not going to Tommy's with any expectations but still got a little disappointed. I'm giving 3/5 mainly because of the venue and the fresh ingredients, but not for the quality of the food. Everything was really blend. It felt like the chef was cooking while having a cold. I had the avocado toast, salad of the day and the pear-fecto juice. The toast was really blend. I mean, avocados itself is delicious. But when you do an avocado toast, you need a little flavour balance. Which was not there in this case. The salad was like the chef just mixed the ingredients with a little bit of oil and that was it. No salt, no lemon or vinaigrette. I mean, it's a salad, how complicated can it be. For the juice, it was good, freshly juiced. So nothing to say on that one :) So... overall. You want a beautiful venue to take beautiful photos. You got it. You want a place to be impressed by the food. Do not go there."
/user_details?userid=sieP-_A4CPXHU0ONM476RA,Kristi T.,"Kaneohe, HI",5 star rating,"I saw that in 2016, Vogue recommended this cafe to be one of the best places to get coffee in Montréal. I will first admit.. I forgot to get coffee! I was entranced by the chai latte instead and ordered that. I had promised myself to come back for a second round simply to try their coffee, but I didn't have the time unfortunately. I will say that the chai latte I had was really tasty, which I find sometimes chai lattes lack, even though the spice should be a standout in the drink. I also ordered a grilled cheese, which I chose as a result of someone else's review. Hands down one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever purchased. I should've asked what cheese they used and what they put on their bread, because damn. It was good. It was a bit crunchy, which personally I liked, and the cheese was thick and filled the sandwich. To be honest, however, it's Tommy's aesthetic that got me. The care looks like the inside of someone's brownstone in NYC, white with a staircase and all sorts of decor. There's a variety of furniture for desk and seating spaces. I even sat between a candy machine and a bookshelf, there are also outlets if you could spot them. It is a really great place to work, seeing that half of those inside were on laptops, typing away. The natural light is also really lovely, and there are bathrooms, which is always a plus in my book. I really wish I could return, and bring my camera to snap more shots of the beautiful interior. I'll end with a shoutout to the staff here, who switch flawlessly between french and english for customers while remaining attentive and kind. Will I return? I hope so."

/user_details?userid=XnZe1XVNQmd0Ump5etdd9g,Maya C.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"If there's a more innovative bathroom in Montreal, I haven't found it. Tucked into the back corner of the cafe's top floor, this bathroom offers a unique open air layout, with its sink and mirror available to all. There are two private toilettes offering cramped quarters. Though I was unhappy to see an advertisement thrust in my face upon closing the door, I suppose it should come as no surprise in the post industrialised neoliberal society we live in. The rest of my toilette experience was fine - the ambient light, beautiful moulding, and antique lantern were excellent touches. I suppose that shy bathroom goers might find the public sink experience a bit daunting, but I give this bathroom extra points for its audacity! The message is clear - one needn't feel shame for using the restroom/commode. The worst part of this bathroom is simply its accessibility, or lack thereof. It can only be reached by walking up two (small) flights of stairs. In a multilevel cafe, it's preferable to have its restroom on the first floor. Still, 5/5 stars for cleanliness, space efficiency, and ambiance! If you need a bathroom near Port, Tommy's is the place to be."

If you don't want a seat with your food and coffee, great. If you do, get those elbows ready! - Other patrons. Clearly people needed seats and yet a lot of people had their sh*t in seats next to them. ...good to know you think your purse and coat are more tired and deserving than your fellow (wo)man. More dick-ish than DC even and that's saying something.- Pastries were okay, but not great.- The drink I ordered was really small, especially for the quality and price.- The music. I liked it, but it was a bit schizophrenic volume-wise and genre-wise. Suddenly it was twice as loud and some pseudo-angry Germany-esque screamy song. My only guess was that maybe it was some sort of clearing technique to get the ""been here 5 hours and counting"" crowd to clear out and make room for more patrons with more money to spend?Not sure I'd come back...now that I've gotten my IG picture. ;)"

The location is in the heart of old montreal not far from the old port and walking distance from the metro. I've come here on a few occasions usually more in search of coffee rather than food. Their coffee is excellent , I really enjoy their oat milk cappuccino and their matcha latte , definitely worth the price. I also tried their booster shot with ginger and cayenne , it was fresh tasty and energizing ! the last time I came by I finally tried the food , I had avocado toast with smoked salmon and my friend had avocado toast with an egg. The quality was good , a good amount of smoked salmon and generous portion of avocado on a thick piece of bread with olive oil and spices. It was enjoyable and everything was very fresh but I agree with the reviews below upwards of 10$ is a tad steep for it. they also had a variety of pastries available as well as salad options and breakfast sandwich options.Great place for a coffee date. I'm not sure this would be my first choice of place for food but I am certainly coming back for their coffee , booster shots,  pastries and for the lovely decor and energetic yet laid back atmosphere."

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it would def enhance the experience. Simply put, it is a b e a u t i f u l duplex cafe with gorgeous plants and retro decor. There are a variety of couches and side tables, tables and chairs, and step seating. Their lattes are great, and there are two menu items I came for twice in the single week I was visiting Montreal - (1) avocado toast and (2) salmon bagel. Sounds simple, but to do it great - maybe in Montreal, and maybe at Tommy. The avocado toast appears simple with red pepper flakes, lemon, salt and mashed avocado over toast, but it is complex in the bread. Perfectly toasted bread with sesame seeds on the side - enhances the flavor of the avo toast by a world difference. The salmon bagel was also amazing. I don't usually like to eat cream cheese, but I was not at all distracted by it because it wasn't drowned in cream cheese. The bagel itself is soft and fluffy, the smoked salmon is tasty and the addition of the red onion really helps cut the after-flavor of eating too much smoked salmon. Highly recommend!"

The menu had a good list of coffees, teas and fresh squeezed juices (I ordered the pear juice and when I saw it I felt like I was at a tiki bar!) We ordered drinks and avocado toasts (+egg and prosciutto) and took our number up to a table. The first floor was all mirrored walls, making the space feel like it went on for infinity, but it's actually pretty small. The tables and seating was all mismatched going for a cool found objects kind of theme. On the upper floor we were able to claim the corner with mismatched couches and an antique coffee table.

I unfortunately can't say I ""loved it"" from a menu perspective, even though i LOVE avo toast. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, but not worth the trek across town. The Pro's are similar to what everyone's saying: decoration (even was a bit decked out for the holidays!), pastries, delicious lattes! Once you order, service is pretty quick!However, my experience there was sub par...I went on a Saturday morning, and the line was massive! I think they could use an extra cash or a new ordering system. There were many empty tables available. Prices for toasts were as follows:*$9 for a plain avo toast, extra for tomato, egg ...*$11-$15 for goat cheese, mushroom etc toastsPersonally, I find this to be fairly overpriced. I was expecting a beautiful plating or a heaping portion, but it was rather ""basic"" in my opinion."

It feels you are in the tropical, with plants, pineapple as decors. The place is very well illuminated by the natural light coming through the big windows. The color scheme (principal ones white and green) brings out the theme of nature. There are small couches on the top floor, few benches here and there. I placed myself by one of the window seat. The counter to order our food is cute, as mentioned earlier little tropicana. From the cashier, to the barista girl, to my server...their services were friendly, helpful and very nice. I took a toast with avocado, chili flakes and smoked salmon. It was excellent. I also got a latte and chocolate pistachio croissant. It was decadent.

Though, If you're older than 30 and want breakfast, I would skip it. Most tables were full of 20-somethings sitting on laptops with a coffee. No place to sit and enjoy breakfast with a companion. We had the breakfast sandwich and avotoast. Both were good. Not amazing or worth a revisit."

The island city (yes, Montreal is an island - bet you didn't know that!) always has new cafes sprouting up, and when Tommy Cafe first opened a few years back, it definitely became one of my favourite spots in Old Montreal.Hubby and I visited the cafe during date night before heading over for dinner at Bonaparte a few blocks down. You can read my review on their tasting menu here. Anyway, Tommy Cafe is in a historical building, so it has many features of the old classical architecture left which gives it a lot of character.What took my heart away was the ceiling.Definitely one of the hottest instagram-worthy spots in the cafe! With classical architecture, hip interior decor, and fresh plants hanging off the ceiling, there wasn't anything that I didn't like about the cafe!Onto the important stuff: the caffeinated drinks and food.The coffee was okay- to be honest, nothing too extraordinarily good or special that left hubby or me wanting to come back for more. The cafe itself was very nice and its vibes drew us to the cafe more so than the coffee. Though we didn't have food at Tommy Cafe that day, I went back by myself on another occasion to get some work done and I ordered a sandwich to try with my coffee. I had lunch here that day.First, I found the sandwich to be a little oily but that was okay-I didn't mind too much. Again, the food wasn't anything fancy or special... it was a pretty plain sandwich that met my hunger needs. I definitely recommend the coffee more than the food at Tommy Cafe.Though Tommy Cafe has a killer vibe, being in a historic building and all, the actual coffee and food can use some improvement. Tommy Cafe is a nice cafe to stop by to get some work done, to grab a bite to eat, or for catching up with a friend. It's definitely a great place to stop by if you're touring Old Montreal, but it isn't the best place to come for the 'best' coffee in the city, so if you're a coffee drinker that takes coffee pretty seriously, this place will probably wouldn't please you the most in that department. I'd still come to get my daily fix of caffeine and take a nice Instagram picture though."

I have to say it is one of the best avo toast dishes I've ever tasted. The quality of the bread was noticeable and everything was made with care. It was a little challenging finding a place to sit but someone got up before too long and we got a seat. Lots of people (parties of 1) on their laptops sitting at tables for two looking as if they are settled in for the duration.

While it's beautiful with all the hanging plants, the place was a total cluster. There was really no space for the line at the counter, which snaked up the stairs (too cold to spread out the door). They were out of bagels when it got to my turn to order so just got two cronuts and two coffees. The coffees were kind of weak, and like previous reviewers said were served in glass cups filled to the brim, and perhaps to make them easier to carry, the coffees were not very hot. The cronuts were nothing special, they were more like strangely shaped donuts than legit cronuts. Yawn."

I'm from Toronto and just like Montreal, Toronto has an abundance of coffee shops. I personally would rate this coffee shop higher than most in Toronto. I ordered the smoked salmon on sesame bagel and a cortado. The smoked salmon bagel was the best I've had and the reason was, aside from the freshness of the smoked salmon was simply the Montreal style bagel. Everyone knows how amazing Montreal bagels are and if you put smoked salmon in it, . The cortado was as good as it gets. My girlfriend got the avocado toast and cubano. The avocado toast came with an egg on top and it was delicious. My girlfriend and I both agreed that it was one of our favorites. The cubano was bitter and strong, just how I like my espresso. Overall, I would definitely visit this coffee house again whenever I am back in the city."

I would recommend going on the WEEKDAYS because on the weekends it becomes the hunger games of trying to get a seat. Perfect if you are into people watching basic girls walk in and out trying to find a ""cute place to study"" in old port where they can take their snapchats but also plug into an outlet. As a study cafe, I would say Tommy can be a bit loud. The wifi here is UNRELIABLE and extremely slow so if you are bringing work, make sure you can get by without it. The best times to come are in the afternoon where you can take advantage of the amazing light that streams in through the windows. The space is undoubtedly gorgeous. the planters hanging from the ceiling and the decor make it feel like your cool aunt's workshop/lounge.

The staff at Cafe Tommy have proven to be careless based on experiences of myself and friends. It is not enough to have a well decorated space with IG appeal. There is only one Batista who makes proper coffee and is kind. The others are unapologetic, gossip behind the counter and require basic customer training. In the photos, I've shared an example of this disrespect Cafe Tommy showed via social media to a friend of a friend. I have never been compelled to write such a review for any business.

That is a big mirror over there on the wall. So before you walk into the mirror thinking you will go sit far from the door, think again. Typical trick to make a space seem bigger and brighter. It works. It looks HUGE in here. Just don't get confused...Caffeinated drink I had was good. You can get alcohol here too if you want. Service typical of Montreal - adequate, never that friendly.

We had looked at the menu beforehand to see if there were any vegan breakfast options, and it looked like the had an acai bowl and avocado toast. However when we ordered apparently the acai bowl was only served at another location and somehow they were already out of avocado. The lady behind the counter was very nice though, and when we asked if there was anything else vegan she pulled out some vegan banana bread that ended up being really hearty and delicious.

So funky, so fresh, just simply welcoming.No filtered iced coffee, but have tried their iced americano, and a donut topped with nutella.  The americana was on point and refreshing.  I shared the donut, but should have gotten 1 each ;).There is wifi, and when I came here on St Jean Baptist holiday (June 24, 2017), there was an English sign that said ""All you can drink mimosas for $25""!Each seat throughout the place really gives you a good vantage point of all the details that makes this place so unique.  There really is so much character.

There is some serious competition for the booths and window seats, you might have to wait a couple hours for people to leave, and the seating is not all that plentiful.

Maybe I'm impartial because it matches the name of my husband, but it's truly an amazing spot. Stayed a long weekend in Montreal, and came here every morning. Amazing coffee, matcha, fresh juice, avocado toast, cronuts, and obviously décor. The staff is super friendly, on one of the mornings their credit card machine was down so we paid in cash (if you're from the US and pay in cash the rate is 1 for 1) but they made up for it by throwing in a few pastries for the inconvenience. Only downside is that it does tend to get crowded at certain times of the day, but it's definitely worth it!"

As a ""tourist"" from Toronto, we were very intrigued by the interior of the cafe when we were passing by and decided to give it a try. Food and drinks were okay, nothing special, so it was a bit overpriced for what it was. It would be a nice place to chill for a few hours though - and i saw that they have all you can drink simosas for like $24!"

I had a salmon bagel which was tasteless and was a very small portion (for 9 bucks). Coffee was ok - nothing outside of what you would expect for any cappuccino. This is a pretty touristic area as Notre Dame is very close to it so you are mostly paying for the location and the environment - which has a nice personality btw. I really wish the food could catch up with the rest.

No regular lactose free milk.)The small is really small.  They served it in a nice glass cup and it was flavourful.  The grilled cheese was good too. I ended up adding prosciutto which had a nice kick, but it wasn't great. The cronut was also nice. Overall though be warned it was pretty pricey though. The atmosphere was nice. It was really busy when I was there but it was to be expected as it was a Saturday at noon and the weather was gorgeous.  Tons of tourists it seemed which makes sense as it is right beside Notre Dame.  It also has an upstairs area which was really nice and was good for extra seating.

The place is beautiful-- it's right on the corner with big, cement steps leading up to huge wooden doors. The inside is all white, which gives it a clean, crisp feel, and the decor is so cute. They have a huge hanging plant in the middle of the room, which gives this place so much character. I got the chai tea latte which was really good, and the croissants are delicious-- especially the almond croissant. The americano coffee portion is very small-- it's basically just a shot. We had to get another coffee from a Starbucks later on because the small serving didn't get the job done. Cute coffee shop to catch up with friends, grab a light bite/get your caffeine fix, or get work done. They have free wifi and comfortable seating. I definitely recommend trying this place out."

I have read that some people find it expensive however you have to remember that this cafe is located in one of the biggest tourist locations in Montreal and you are also paying extra for the ambiance.

The food didn't tempt me, the latte was lovely but not the best I've had in town, but the energy is freaking wonderful. The room is so beautiful the way it lifts upwards with its twisting stairs, incredible old moldings, bright plants and so much light. Mostly what thrills you when you are here I think is to see an historic and gorgeous piece of architecture used in such a smart, modern, welcoming way. There are lots of different kinds of seating and the cafe is full of lots of different kinds of people, not just hipster coffee snobs, all kinds of cultures and ages seemed tucked throughout working, talking or cuddling over coffee. Tommy is part of a shift that is happening in Old Montreal, away from a dangerous and boring slide into tourist traps, and into a flourishing of bars, cafes and restaurants that actually speak to local tastes and rhythms. There are some weirdo bits of decor that feel like someone checking off a list of pinterest hipness: bike! typewriter! Danish modernism! But whatever, I do like a lot of those things so who cares."

They have a good selection of breakfast/brunch foods, like savory croissant sandwiches and avocado toast, but my favorite things were the sweet treats. I had the chocolate pistachio croissant and it was amazing. At first I thought it was a little expensive at $5 but then I remembered it was $5 CAD, which is about $4 USD. And after tasting it I felt it was so worth it. I so badly wanted to buy all of their sweets because they looked so good, but if you can only get one like me, I highly recommend the chocolat pistache croissant. Days after having it, I'm still thinking about it. The egg croissants were also really, really good and I recommend them as well.The matcha rose latte was okay. I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste, but to me it just tasted like creamy water with a thick layer of matcha powder on top. My sister liked it but I personally wasn't a fan.The employees were nice and welcoming, but they somehow didn't ring up my croissant (the incredible chocolate pistachio one) so we ended up waiting 15 minutes before they told us that they didn't put it in the system. They also didn't apologize for the mistake, but since it was so delicious I wasn't even mad about it. I did however take one star off because of that, because it says something about their customer service.The café itself is gorgeous. Being in Old Montreal, the exterior is gorgeous. The buildings are historical and just are incredible to be around. The interior was cozy but felt very open as there was a loft area, with seating along the walls going upstairs. They made use of the space by adding seats everywhere they could, which I thought was a great idea, although tables are limited as the place can get quite busy."

I have to admit, I had seen a picture of their cafe on Instagram, and that is why I was intrigued. The decor was incredible - I believe they had restored the British Empire Building, so all the original architecture and moldings were in tact. They also had a top floor with a couch area and fun trinkets. And the ceiling decor was gorgeous! That's where the praise ends, unfortunately. I had a mocha with soy milk. It came up to about $8 with tip. way overpriced, in my opinion. The washrooms were clean, but neither stall had any toilet paper left...which just shows the upkeep.  As well, my friend and I had met up for lunch (I had seen on their social media that they do serve food and they have a lunch special marked on their menu). They told us that they didn't have any sandwiches or salads that day... hmm. I didn't want to eat any baked goods for lunch, so we enjoyed the architecture for a bit with our drinks and then headed to the next door cafe for food. Soo promising, but unfortunately, disappointing."

My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday around 2pm. They ran out of tomatoes, raspberries, and peaches, which were three of the key ingredients on the toasts we wanted to try. It was surprising to me that a busy restaurant in the heart of a city would run out of essential supplies on a weekend like that. The toasts themselves were expensive as well, around 10-15 Canadian dollars for one small piece of bread. We opted for a croissant as well because it was less money, but it too was not impressive. Very cute decor and nice interior but menu was disappointing."

Everything about this place was stunningly beautiful and creative; from the mirrors on the wall, to the marble surfboard, to the genius music playlist . While the coffee wasn't the best, the atmosphere at this shop makes it ideal for short hangouts with friends or long study sessions."

/user_details?userid=PpUz8d9S4FRgkMweuGDM8Q,Karen L.,"Belmont, MA",3 star rating,"A very cute, casual, hip environment but disappointed by the food. Chai tea latte was watery, we ordered three sandwiches for take away and one was wrong and the chocolate croissant was dry. It's unfortunate that the food was so bad considering the environment and location."
/user_details?userid=JIYy7V1aTSz0eAqo5DnI9A,Kitty S.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"This is essentially a nice coffee shop in a very cool space.  Food selection was VERY limited and service is not good.  Very slow and they don't seem to know what they're doing.  They gave the wrong item then tried to heat a croissant in a microwave which makes it soggy?!?!?  My expectations were probably too high for the place which is why I walked away quite disappointed..... Come here for a coffee, hang out for a few minutes then leave.  Don't expect any real/good food."
