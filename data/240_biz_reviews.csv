They have a large selection to choose from of unique Persian style sandwiches. I have tried a couple but my favourite has to be their Roast Beef (lots of fresh parsley yum) and their Pizza Sandwich - full of flavour and fresh ingredients.The meat is Halal and service is great. Items are wrapped very well so you can just grab and go. A must to try!"
/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"The area around Guy Concordia is home to some of the best ethnic restaurants in the city. You can find a dozen cheap and delicious eats just a stone throw away from the school. I had no idea this place existed until very recently.Hailar is comprised of two floors: the first floor is dedicated exclusively for takeout orders. When you walk up the stairs to the second floor you're treated to a surprisingly luxe tea room dining area. Red velvet drapes add to the cozy and elegant interior. They have a relatively small menu that consists of options between hot sandwiches or pizza. I have yet to try the sandwiches but I've gotten the vegetarian pizza each time I've come. For around $10/12"" pizza you'll definitely be getting your money's worth here. You can easily split this between two people and both be left feeling pretty full. The addition of potato sticks (weird ikr) give these pizzas a delicious, unexpected twist. To top it all off, the service is warm and friendly. Also, do yourself a favour and try their carrot cake. It's like eating a cake made by your mom. Definitely do give this place a try if you're in the area!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"You guys. I have the most endearing story to tell you about Chez Hailar. But just so you know, Chez Hailar is an Iranian restaurant that specializes in halal pizzas and subs with their own ""special sauce"". I didn't know this but Iranians seem to have their own spin on pizza (they add potato chip sticks and a special sauce on top) and it works!So here's my story: we visited Chez Hailar during #PizzaFest Mtl since I had previously tried it for delivery and loved it. While the food was delicious, the service was very slow. When I think of fast food, I don't think of sitting for 2 hours in a restaurant!It took 25 minutes before we received water. That's unacceptable! It also took a while longer before we received our drinks and pizzas - good thing it was worth the wait! The roast beef pizza is really unique and the vegetarian pizza is full of veggies. That Chez Hailar sauce though - yum. I could down that whole bottle.After another long wait and a failed attempt at getting a waiter's attention, I had to get up and ask for my bill. While that was annoying, the food is stellar.Chez Hailar felt so bad about my negative experience with the service that they sent an employee to apologize to my apartment in person. AND he brought me a freshly baked roast beef pizza. On the inside of the box, they wrote: ""Please accept our sincere apologies. We would love to serve you @ChezHailar again.""Maybe our last visit was a fluke and we were just unlucky with where we were sitting and how busy the restaurant got. Or maybe as they explained, it's normal as per Iranian customs to not want your customers to feel rushed.Regardless, I'm happy that management took my comments seriously and wanted to rectify the situation. It's rare that a restaurant would go out of their way to apologize face-to-face and send over a piping hot pizza! It's also heart-warming to see how important this family business is to them and I want to support that.Order in and enjoy their perfectly toasted subs and crispy, delicious and halal pizzas. I appreciate that while there's plenty of amazing halal meats available for the subs and pizzas, there's also a lot of vegetarian options. I'm really glad that I gave Chez Hailar a chance and I think you should too!"
/user_details?userid=X9U54S5iaJE6Z36yZJoA3A,Rashid T.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Restaurant looked completely different from outside. When we walked in we felt we were walking into somebody's home but in a good way. There was a family on the dining table who were enjoying the meal. We were welcome by two very nice people and they seated us. Decor looked fancy but the prices are decent. Food is delicious. Here are 5 reason why we will Absolutely go back when we visit again. 1. We ordered sandwiches and they were delicious. Parsley added great taste to the sandwiches. Bread was perfect for this type of sandwich. 2. We were not too hungry so we ordered one large sandwich which was good enough for two people. We ordered Tea and tea was as delicious. 3. Service was wonderful. They were super nice and accommodating.4. All meats are halal5. Their pizzas looked amazing on the menu and in pictures. We really wanted to go back to try it this trip but Montreal offered too many good restaurants and we didn't have a chance to go back. We will be definitely going back to try their pizza next time.
/user_details?userid=_Ot82MLC1MsH3SIyDUwsEg,Morvarid M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"With all the positive reviews, I honestly expected more from this restaurant. We came here only to try their famous Persian style pizza, but surprisingly, they were out of pizza dough! This was just so unacceptable! We had a few choices from the menu. Their menu was completely different from the one they have on their website. The prices and the number of meals were different. We tried the shredded-beef special sandwich and the pizza sandwich. I loved them both. The shredded-beef sandwich had an exceptional taste. I only ordered the pizza sandwich just to get the taste of their pizzas, which was amazing! P.S: Don't count on the 10% student discount cause they won't give you any!"

Take the stairs and find the cozy, warm and homey room with beautiful and chic furniture. Persian music is on non stop not too loud to stop you from enjoying your meal. We ordered both roast beef pizza and the roast beef sandwich. Yummy and yummy 14-inch sandwich, cheesy and meaty! Nice staff. Acceptable service. Decent food quality and reasonable check. I will stop by again for sure."
/user_details?userid=RdYyQLa9f0_AlAM8RWCgmw,Bob L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,For muslims: its all halal! Enjoy!We highly recommend Hailar special pizza (Persian-style pizza) and shredded-beef Hailar special sandwich. Really delicious!

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I haven't been to Hailar in almost a year but I have fond memories of my several informal forays into this cozy restaurant. Hailar is the kind of place where you're expecting a casual dining experience (because the food is honestly casual) but the ambiance is anything but. It looks like your fancy great-aunt's tea room upstairs. Old flowery curtains, clunky big furniture, it's almost like a character piece from a good TV show. The best way I can describe the food is like jazzed up bro-food. There are these Persian style pizzas with loads of meat on top and sandwiches, cold and hot, lots of casual eating and mediocre service from middle aged Iranian women. The entire experience is comically enjoyable. I love this place, have visited many a time and recommend it to the adventurous who want to try a different kind of fast food."
/user_details?userid=5CVNlFCWVOgfYQlEAYPU-g,S V.,"Edmond, OK",2 star rating,"Went there because of good reviews but it was mostly a disappointment. Location is good but not a good place for some one with mobility issues due to bunch of narrow stairs. Uncomfortable chairs, outdated decor and a single ,young student working there as the waiter and also probably the cook. The sandwiches are just deli meat in bun and pizza was awe full. Service however was ok. Would not recommend for. Family or for anyone who wants to try Persian food."
/user_details?userid=TdkAOOvCtFLoFLLsxZNL5g,Zou Y.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The tea was exactly the same as what I had in Iran. The pizza was normal. It was a bit cold. I don't recommend the banana milkshake because it was not milkshake but completely ice cream.
/user_details?userid=SqFjKZhnF_EiDK-FPM2WPg,Katherine M.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,This was a great find for a late night pizza. And the hickory sticks are fantastic as a topping! Definitely will be coming back.
/user_details?userid=m0C5GXYmOetxKZDQ_Ml8ZQ,Catherine R.,"Chelsea, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered pizza for an event from Chez Hailar. Service was excellent and delivery on time. The pizzas themselves were amazing, nothing like your traditional pizza place. Thin crusted, delicious toppings (we've tried the vegetarian and pepperoni pizzas), a spicy mayo-based dip. Would definitely recommend this restaurant !"
/user_details?userid=DNQr3uWasASQgD5ovTuT3A,Emma O.,"Sinking Spring, PA",5 star rating,"Amazing food and very kind company. Service was good and prices are very reasonable. A 7"" sandwich is plenty!"
/user_details?userid=Ai6hp1zy64CzpFz6twOmKQ,Annie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered their roast beef pizza last night and it was amazing! I'm not a fan of potato sticks with my pizza, so I asked to have it on the side instead. The pizza is full of cheesy goodness, their roast beef just melted in my mouth, and the crust was not too thin/thick, just perfect. Also, compared to other restos nearby this place is really clean, like seriously you can feel how neat and clean the place is once you step inside. The staff seems nice and friendly as well. I wish they'd just mentioned there's garlic in their special sauce, but it's on the side,so no need to worry if you don't like garlic."
