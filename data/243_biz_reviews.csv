Still the same mouth watering burgers, only this time we discovered the ""Secret menu"" and oh my, their cod Siracha burger was so good! My husband took the classic notre bœuf de grave burger and enjoyed it very much as well. The place is not as big as St Laurent but it still very cute and cozy. Keep up the great work NBdG!!"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a review for a take out order -- and you guessed it; it was for a burger (as their logo is literally the outline of a hamburger and bun with toppings). I figured, I'd just go for the straight up classic (6 oz) job which had a pure beef taste. I won't say what fast food place it tasted like, but on a pure and simple burger 101 level, it's actually a compliment.What I thought was going to be the highlight, their secret sauce got absorbed into the brioche bun, but looked orangey pink, so is possibly some kind of mayo ketchup blend...they don't call it secret. The bun was quite good and probably absorbed the sauce while waiting to be eaten (in person dining, most likely gets more flowing sauce).In no particular order; the pickles had good flavor and were on the vinegary side, the lettuce crisp, the tomato not memorable either way and the white onion was fresh and cut the right thickness for a topping.The fries were moist and dark, the way I like them. At 13+t it's about right for the quality, size and value -- not to thick, not too thin -- a good go-to, standard, straight up, burger night burger. The take out service was also good and as prompt as can be expected when ordering hot food."

Service is very slow but I expect that to pick up once they get into a groove.We were a group of six with two children and they sat  us in the back booth. It's a half round and a was perfect for our group size. It's rare for a group that big that everyone gets a comfy seat. During the summer they'll have a patio for some nice out door seating. The portions are pretty small for a typical restaurant portion. We felt like they were more at home meal sizes. Which was great and less waste! The waitress, was pleasant but a little slow as she was by herself handling a decent amount of tables. I don't think they expected it to be that busy. We got the apocalypse and my only complaint was the toast was too hard. It prolly sat under the heat lamp for too long. Which happens but it ended up cutting the roof of my mouth. Hah whoops. The tator tots were  perfectly cooked  and the egg  salami jalapeño mash was DELICIOUS. Their in home hot sauce is a must try."
