The Americano I ordered reminded me of something I would find in a trendy cafe in San Francisco. The carrot muffin was perfection, very moist not too dry. A rich blend of so many spices."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Beautiful and simple little café near Jeanne-Mance Parc. It's a perfect coffee shop stop before or after a walk on Mont-Royal mountain.  The esthetic is white and modern with touches of green from the various plants set-up around the space. The owners were kind and obviously enthusiastic about opening their business. They prepared the allongé and oat milk latte very fast and even were sweet enough to bring them to our table since wwe  were there on a slow day. I highly recommend this coffee shop for those looking for a bite to eat and a coffee before hiking up the mountain.

Edmond has opened almost a year ago, yet there are no reviews on Yelp? Shame on us!Edmond is first and foremost a coffee shop. A cute one at that, with an Instagramy decor. And they do make a great latte, using the fine beans from De Mello Palheta (Toronto). While I do enjoy a third-wavy-fruity-full-on-acidity latte once in a while, I prefer more classical notes. Their latte is sweet tasting (naturally, no added sugar), well-balanced, with delicious notes of chocolate and caramel. The milk was frothed to perfection.In terms of lunch fare, their menu is limited but yummy nonetheless. I have the persian chicken sandwich (ciabatta, spiced persian chicken, remoulade), served with a choice of salad (greens with blue potatoes). The plate was almost licked clean.Will I return? Definitely."

It's a great location with the relaxed ambience for someone walking in the Jeanne-Mance park. After a long walk, we had a ball on the weekend to have a glass of refreshing iced americano and cold brew."
