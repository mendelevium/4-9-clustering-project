I usually start off my reviews by describing the resto decor but I will skip over the food review as it was of the best chineese resto's I have been to. Upon entering the resto one's tastebuds begin to awaken as the aromas coming from the kitchen are quickly noticed by the sense of smell. All dishes were beautifully plated and made with local fresh ingredients. No MSG  used in their dishes. Great food quality for whst you are paying. All our plates tasted delicious and packed with tantalizing flavors and aromas. I had high expecations going in and my expectations were in fact exceeded which rarely happens. We started off with their famous grilled ribs...so delicious and finger linkin good!  Yummy!  This is a must try dish! I also had their peanut butter dumplings which were perfect with a hint of spiciness and not overly sweet!  Yummy!! We also tried their general Tao chicken, sauteed Tofu, basil chicken - all of which were amazing!!!  Not expensive for food quality.  The service was super friendly and welcoming! Honestly, I strongly recommend thus family run resto and will definately go back!!"

I really dont mind paying for expensive foods but this is like stealing / ridiculous.Cheap quality foods, either too sweet or too salty & very small portion for an expensive price. Foods court or chinatown foods taste better & has double the portion.General tao is too way too sweet 22$ & Calamari 25$ is way too salty & both very small portion. Hot & Sour soup taste ONLY like soya sauce & not even 1 shrimp inside for 7$ a bol. With all that too sweet or too salty foods, they didn't even offer us a glass of water."

The garlic short ribs were to die for. The Chinese vegetables fresh and delicious. We rounded it out with shrimp and pineapple fried rice, all of which that were gluten free for my friend with a gluten intolerance. Am making a point to go back before we head back home."
