/user_details?userid=yeKevNN0bbaOPLObW2g7lQ,Chloe G.,"Saint-Eustache, Canada",5 star rating,"I had wanted to try Indonesian food for so long being a big fan of Indomie Mi Goreng instant noodles (be warned Mi Goreng is a gateway drug for Indonesian cuisine).Nonya permitted me to expand my very limited experience to a higher gastronomic level. Atmosphere: I went there for a date on a Saturday, we showed up around 5-530 which is early for supper in Montreal. Therefore the place was not full yet. The decor is lovely, with traditional art, plants, and tasteful knick knacks. Drink: They did have house drinks which looked original and sophistacated, but I stuck to a beer.Food: I ordered the vegan table d'hôte. It came with turmeric rice in banana leaf, tofu and tempeh skewers, curried tofu, jack fruit, young coconut, taro shreds, pickles, manioc fries and eggplant in tomato sauce. There is not a single think I did not like. The taro shreds were very salty so I used them as a seasoning on the rice which was great. It was alot of food, but I ate every last bite because I knew I would later regret it if I didn't.Service: The staff were incredibly welcoming, polite, and helpful with recommendations. The pace of the service allowed us to enjoy our meal and enjoy our conversation without wondering when the next course was coming or feeling overwhelmed by a pace that was too fast. I would and have recommend Nonya to friends, and I plan to come here again."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Can't believe this place has such a high rating on yelp and google. The reviews seem old and outdated. We were very disappointed by the food and couldn't finish them. We took the tasting menu for 62$ per person to get a taste of everything. It was way too expensive for the quality of the food we got. It first came with a supposingly spicy and sour soup that was only spicy and had no other taste. There were tomatoes, fish and pineapple inside but their flavor didn't blend with the soup at all. The appetizer platter consists of spring rolls, salad and dumplings in peanut sauce. The spring rolls/imperial rolls tasted exactly like the frozen ones from the supermarket. The salad and dumplings were ok. For the main course, the shrimps were overcooked, the squid was extremely salty, the duck was too chewy, etc. Anyway, you get the idea. As for the dessert, we got a coconut pudding with purple rice and a canned cherry that didn't match with rest of the ingredients. The place deserves a 2 stars for the service and the decorations. We sat on their terrasse and it was quite nice and cozy. The staff were friendly and the food came quickly. Unfortunately, I wouldn't come back here."
/user_details?userid=9SsFYq1J_72GoSOD8oYHWQ,Julianna F.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,"This year has been a fresh start for a lot of things.  New job, new relationship and an appetite for amazing food (which I always have)My boyfriend and I decided that we'd pick a restaurant every few weeks from different parts around the world, to get out of our comfort zone and try some really authentic cuisines.I got the first pick.  And did I ever choose right!I'm a self proclaimed foodie with a palate that would make the late Anthony Bourdain proud.Having a nut allergy limits me sometimes to certain restaurants, but Nonya definitely took care of me.Our waiter gave us his recommendations and suggestions, helped us choose safely so I could eat and not die.  We chose the seafood option for 2. Started off with a butternut squash soup that brought tears to my eyes.  Then the dishes started coming in: scallops and asparagus , butterfly shrimp, aubergine, pickled veggies, octopus, calamari and cod in a curry coconut broth.  Everything was absolutely delicious, from the presentation down to the sauces, spices and overall taste.  I was REALLY impressed by how well the octopus, scallops and calamari were cooked.  The cod in curry broth was probably the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth.  For desert we had green beans in coconut milk with just some pieces of coconut.  Super light, and helped clean the palate and digest well.  We can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu.   We were both completely blown away, not only about the food, but how beautiful and quaint the restaurant was and how genuine the staff was.Thank you Nonya"
/user_details?userid=nBf6-0Or3H63PDk-rbRoCQ,Michael T.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Before I begin, I have never tried Indonesian food other than Migoreng, so I will give the benefit of the doubt for its authenticity.Another side tip is that this restaurant does have vegan options, so for the big growing community of vegans, you're in luck.We came here early on a Saturday evening and we sat on the terrasse. We were greeted nicely by the waitress and quickly asked if we had any questions. On the service side, I gotta give this a solid 5 stars.We chose the ""Table d'hôte"" option. I took the Satay Ayam (chicken satay skewers) and my significant other had the vegan javanese dish (Tempeh and Tofu skewers). It came with a squash soup that felt great to the soul and was very tasty (a little hit of spicyness). It also came with a green salad, but I opted for the Lumpia, which is a fried imperial roll (every asian country has their alternative of it). Lumpia was fried lightly, crunchy and the aroma and taste of the bamboo shoots in the Lumpia was really delicious.Now for the main course, we had a lot of side dishes along with our main dish. For the Satay Ayam side, I got four chicken satay skewers with peanut butter sauce, I got a bowl of white rice with fried scallions on top, shrimp crackers with anchovies & peanut, green curry tofu and tomato puré eggplants, shredded coconut curry. On the vegan javanese side, the only difference was pickled veggies dish, a tumeric rice bowl, fried taro bits and curry jackfruit.Now I could probably give this a 5 stars, but I also had to give the benefit of the doubt for the taste of the food. I really enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but I feel like the chicken skewers was missing a bit of flavour, but they did give me a dipping sauce on the side that helped with the flavour. My dipping sauce felt like a mix of fish sauce, hoisin sauce, and chili sauce. The fried taro chips/tips were very salty even for a southern Chinese guy like me (we eat very salty food as that used to be our only mean of preserving meat - through salt). Also, the shrimp crackers were too shrimpy for me, but that's personal so I didn't put that in consideration. TThe dessert was really light and nice. A simple mixture of mung beans in coconut milk. Good if you had spicy food, and good for a summer night.In a nutshell, we really enjoyed it and we would definitely come back for more."
/user_details?userid=r4Kac9JDnig5oCO8-tNFmQ,Melody M.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2 star rating,"So, I had really high expectations coming here as I've grown up eating Indonesian food my whole life, but what a disappointment this experience was. :(I had a reservation for 6:00 for 3 but arrived a bit late, however we were seated quickly and the waiter was pretty nice about it. Alright, I'm not sure if we just came on an off-day but it seemed like there were only 2 waiters on the floor for a dinner crowd so it took a VERY long time for anyone to take our order and even longer for the actual food to come out. If you order from the Table d'hote you'll at least get some soup and salad before the actual plates come out but if not then prepare for a long wait.Okay, so when my food came out I was more than ready to dig in. At this point I've waited pretty close to an hour and was starving but the food really wasn't anything that I expected. The presentation? Really nice/elegant but the taste was super salty. I ordered, Bakso Babi (fried beef balls), Satay Ayam (grilled chicken skewers), Sing Kang Goreng (fried cassava), and Nasi Kuning (yellow rice). And everything, aside from the Nasi Kuning, was way too salty for me! I couldn't eat anything without the the Nasi Kuning to help wash it down. The dessert was the only other redeeming dish I had, black rice in coconut milk which was really good and it was sweet that they put a candle on mine since it was my birthday, but by the time we left, it was 9:30pm and the bill came out to be around $40. Definitely would not come again."
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A friend invited me to try this place and of course given that I had never tried Indonesian cuisine I gladly accepted.  We arrived around 8:30, the restaurant was not full, so lucky us we could be seated at the terrace (which was very nice btw I particularly liked the lights). We ordered a selection of Indonesian specialties and everything tasted amazingly well. Their cocktail and wine selection is extensive and eclectic. I would recommend this place for the very good service and food, and will definitely be going back in the near future."
/user_details?userid=HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"Straight up -- the cooking and the quality is NOT BAD.However, I am sorely disappointed because this is not Malaysian food. I know what you are thinking - how can this be? Their name is ""NONYA"", is it not -- I even came here thinking it would be like the one in NYC also named ""Nonya"".This is more Indonesian food, and that... is also debatable.Honestly, there are good dishes like the Beef Rendang, but the dessert was terrible (beans with milk and sugar? WTF?), the chicken was okay but not amazing, and the rest of the food was ""meh"" for me. Even the fried chicken had nothing special to it -- no spices, no pandan leaf, nothing!I'd skip it if you are looking for an authentic, Malaysian meal. Come here if you are willing to fork out $$$ for small-ish portions and to eat something resembling Indonesian food.This place has NOTHING on the Nonya in NYC in Little Italy. Now THAT is good Malaysian fare."

/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"I ordered delivery from Nonya and was delighted by their yellow curry and my dining partner was absolutely in awe by their rendang curry. Both were light, flavourful and a delight to savour. I also tried their vegetable tempura which I wouldn't recommend ; it was oily and the batter left a slightly bitter taste in ones mouth.However, it really didn't sway my opinion of this place too much; the curries were just too fantastic! If you're ordering delivery from them; their tofu yellow curry is a small portion so order two for a full meal!"
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a lovely experience at Nonya. I ordered the vegan table d'hôte and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of the dishes. Every item was carefully prepared and presented. I'm curious about the multiple reviewers who claimed the food was too salty; I wonder if this is only characteristic of their meat, because I am pretty sensitive to overly sweet or salty foods, and none of the dishes I tried could be described as either. I found everything delicious and created with attention to detail. While the portions for each dish are small (it's more of a tasting menu), each bite was delightful. The restaurant also has a selection of wine which paired perfectly with the meal. The only drawbacks are that the wait-time to receive the food was a little long, and the portion sizes were on the small side. This wasn't a problem for me, but someone with a more robust appetite might have left a little hungry. The food is also on the pricey side - the table d'hôte + one glass of the cheapest wine each for two people came to $100 with tax and tip. While I don't think this is unreasonable for the quality and presentation of the dinner, it would make it difficult for me to come here on a more regular basis. All in all, a great little gem that I would definitely recommend. I look forward to a second visit. :)"

/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,we had the 2 person tasting menu Terre et Mer . Very desapointing except the beef and a spicy chicken drained in a very salty sauce. The other plates were too salty aswell. The lamb kabab was overcooked. The shrimp was ok. The cod in coconut sauce was too liquid and tbe eggplants were not cooked. The squid and zucchini were a joke in some tastless italian tomato sauce. All this for 100$ for 2 people. Never again. I should of known from the moment i walked in not a single asian table.
/user_details?userid=0lgWlO_8peNsK4Dw0-Al3g,Sonny T.,"Tucson, AZ",4 star rating,"I had a business trip to Montreal last month and got a chance to try this place. I ordered some tapas menu so I got to try different things before I got full. Lamb skewer (sate kambing), shrimp crackers, with jasmine rice. The presentation was really good, though that was not how normally indonesian food is served. Taste was also good, Im not picky eater but their food made me came back for another trip. Then I closed my meal with sticky sweet black rice in coconut milk, really delicious. Next trip here, I ordered gado2, rice cake, and some spring rolls. Again presentation was really good, and taste met my expectation. If I have more nights here then I might come back to try more menus. Two times to this restaurant my waiting time was reasonable, they were other tables with group of people but I never felt abandoned. I would give 5 stars if they have more dessert selection.."

/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We bought a groupon for Nonya for a seafood tasting menu. I think the reason nonya is on groupon is because they are pending a liquor license. We were ok without booze for the dinner. We each had a coconut water instead. The menu was very good, specifically the fish and the duck. The duck fell off the bone and was equally crispy and tender. I feel for a tasting menu it seemed a little small- I wasn't stuffed at all but I was satisfied. It was all presented very nicely and the service was good. Do not, however, attempt to order a coffee- this is not their specialty!! The panacotta for dessert was creamy and delicious."
/user_details?userid=6PfDgf6ONhBtK8xjER9rRA,kitty a.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",5 star rating,"The Indonesian-style poutine was the most exciting thing I ate in Montreal!We came here on the recommendation of a co-worker, because my Indonesian husband needed his rice fix, and we were not disappointed. In fact, we ate here twice during our four days in town. It's a little bit rare to see any kind of Indonesian fusion cooking, and it's great that Chef Ivan is pushing the boundaries with things like creme brulee pandan and the aforementioned poutine. The more traditional Indonesian dishes like beef rendang, chicken and (especially) beef sate, gudeg nangka and nasi kuning are also quite good, as is the crispy duck. Can't wait to come back to Montreal so we can eat here again!"
/user_details?userid=gHpMlgQFQB8D8_JzOY_1YA,Anthony S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very nice ambience. I was told by the waiter that they no longer offer their famous testing set menu (rijstaffel) since some of dishes are seasonal. But the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef and he prepared it for us.. Some season dishes were replaced and we were happy!!
/user_details?userid=0GEtkoRs_tu3esR-6H8_0w,Matthew L.,"Alamo, CA",5 star rating,"Fantastic food! They have a large selection of dishes; I've been here four times, haven't tried them all, and haven't been disappointed yet. Table d'hote comes with a number of small (2-3 bites) sides, which provide an excellent opportunity for the chefs to show off their skills, and the diner to maximize the diversity of their flavor experience.The service has always been friendly, and the ambiance is not overly trendy. It's music and decor are both traditional Indonesian. The lunch and tapas specials are very reasonably priced.The peanut+anchovy appetizer, laksa, and beef rendang, are so good that they make it difficult to try new things when I go. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=VwpTZDoZbUH_iBOeMuWJhw,Vince Z.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"We roamed around the city and ran into this restaurant, it was surprisingly good.  The atmosphere was good, services was great and the food was excellent.  We ordered sambal chicken, it was very spicy with a lot of flavors.  Grilled chicken in red curry (Ayam Bakar), it is not like what it sounds, it is a lightly fried chicken and not greasy, maybe it was marinated with red curry and was delicious.  Laksa soup has a different taste, but was also good.  Almost forgot to mention about the Indonesian fusion poutine, it is quite amazing.  Pleasant dinner with family while visited from west coast. Will definitely come back again before we go back home."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I had never had Indonesian food before so when there was a Living Social deal for the restaurant it seemed like something worth trying.  The deal got you the Rijstaffel (tasting menu) for $20 when it is normally $40.   It's a small restaurant but the decor and ambiance is quite fitting for an Asian place.  A ton of food comes with the Rujstaffel option.  A lot of the menu items were flavoured with coconut and lemongrass so my guess is that these two ingredients are important in Indonesian cuisine.   The meats (beef and chicken) were very tender and just fell apart.  I also was a fan of the chili peanut sauce that came with the chicken.  The dessert featured sticky rice in coconut milk and was really good as well as green tea creme brulee.  I must admit I found the creme brulee a bit odd but the other dessert was quite good.The service was slightly on the slow side but that was my only major real issue with the place.   Overall I think I would definitely come back to this place.  It;s a great little restaurant when you're looking for something out of the ordinary.
/user_details?userid=iEONL-v4W46yliYsovCP_g,Dan R.,"Harrisburg, PA",5 star rating,"Pretty decent Indonesian Food. My wife and I visited montreal in october of 2007, we were only in the area for a few days, and wanted to try different kinds of foods. This place was pretty unique. It is a reijstaffel style restaurant, where you order for 2 or more people, they bring the food out to you one dish at a time, you can choose from some of the items: fish, beef or pork. We had some vanilla ice cream and lapis legit there. Our waitress was quebecois, but also spoke english. She explained all the different foods to us as she brought them out and also took the time to make sure our water was full and that we were comfortable in our chairs. After our meal was almost finished he chef came out and wished us 'salamt makan' or a happy meal. So we asked for him and he sat down and told us the history or his place, how long he had been there, etc. It is a family business, him his sister and parents help out.This is the third or fourth location of this restaurant, it has moved a few different times. They accept cash, credit and in the winter are only open for dinner 5p - 9p. original review (pre-yelp canada)"

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Authentic Indonesian is a bit of a rarity in Montreal but Nonya does just fine. The beef rendang is particularly good. The service was friendly. I came here with a group and everyone left quite satisfied. I do suggest trying out the reijstaffel menu so you get to taste a bit of everything.I'll be returning.
/user_details?userid=Myy-tV1aKksxkQ2R7QUkAQ,Kwoky L.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Nonya might be upscale but the flavor definitely tastes homemade. I am a Malaysian myself but the food reminds me of home. I would suggest their table d'hote because it is a pretty good deal if you ask me. My meal started with gado gado, a salad with a wonderful peanut sauce. Then came my entree - bebek bengil which is fried duck leg, perfectly crunchy on the outside but oh so tender on the inside, served with rice and the vegetable of the day. Did I mention that we also get complimentary krupuk udang or prawn crackers to go with the meal? We had a platter of four desserts because we decided to try all of them. A must try is their pandan flavored creme brulee. Service was rather slow but the food were carefully plated with all the details. It was worth the wait. Since the restaurant is more upscale, they also don't offer street/hawker style dessert like es campur, which we were craving for. Last but not least, they gave us each a Kopiko candy which is a favorite in South east Asia. Overall, it was a great experience for all of us. I wish the portions were bigger. They were so tiny, I could eat three portions myself. Nevertheless, this definitely won't be my last time here."

I didn't expect to find a good Indonesian restaurant in Montreal but this is one of the best I've ever been to, even better than the ones I've been to in San Francisco. Mind you, my sample size isn't extensive.I'd suggest going for the tasting menu (Rijsttafel). It's a little expensive (40-45$ per person) but you get to taste a little bit of everything. They also have a table d'hote special from Monday to Wednesday (I believe): 3 course meal from 20 to 23$.The owner of the restaurant is also really nice."

I had the Vegan Delights (very much appreciated the vegan options), which was a fantastic spread of saffron rice, curry tofu, shredded coconut, jackfruit (both the coconut and jackfruit were really well prepared), spicy cucumber, fried cassava, crispy taro, and a skewer each of tempeh and tofu with a sweet soy sauce. The omnivores all enjoyed their meals, too. If I weren't vegan, I would have been excited to try Nonya's Indonesian take on poutine, which sounds fun. The outdoor seating area is very pleasant on a nice summer evening. The service was kind, though not overly attentive. We weren't in a rush, though, and I very much enjoyed the meal and would happily go back."

Hear me outI bought a coupon off of Groupon. Reservations were for 7. We got seated at 7:30 (I get it. They're busy). We got a menu 45 minutes later... no water, no alcohol, no nothing... The waited came back to see my table about 45-06 minutes after and took our menu and placed the order for us........ WITHOUT US PLACING THE ORDER!!. Eh excuse me. can I choose my food?? I had overheard someone from another table mentioning something about nuts in the sauces of this resto.. now we have a BIG problem seeing as how my boyfriend is highly allergic to nuts. We went to go see the waited and asked to ensure the food not be made with nuts however all their sauces are made from a nut base and it cannot be removed.So we waited about an hour and 45min to two hours, got NOTHING at all (NO WATER OR ANYTHING.. NOT EVEN A NAPKIN!!) and had to leave. Thank god Panos is close by..I will never step foot into this place."

I haven't had many chances to try Indonesian, so I was very excited when I stumbled across it a few weeks ago.At the recommendation of the server, I waited a few minutes for an outdoor table (it was pretty warm inside). While I waited at the bar she brought me some water and salted peanuts to snack on. Once seated I got a homemade mint lemon/limeade (delicious, but a little pricier than expected at $4), more peanuts, and shrimp chips. I ordered the Indonesian-style crispy duck leg ($18), which came with rice and a few scoops of sides (okra, curried tofu, and some type of shredded pickled vegetable). The duck was tender and moist with very crispy skin (deep-fried?). Each of the sides were distinctly flavoured, although the yellow curry was a bit mild for my taste. The portions weren't huge, so I think I would get an appetiser next time. It was all very tasty! I can't wait to go back with a few people so I can try out the rest of their dishes.One thing to note, one of the previous reviews mentioned wine. I was told they couldn't serve alcohol, but maybe this only applies to the patio?"

/user_details?userid=zGGsjN136oUMA92_LjL8_g,Erica L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Thank the LORD, there exists decent (even, dare I say, delectable) thai curry in Montreal! I know, I know, it's an Indonesian restaurant, but I won't lie and say that I know the difference between the two cuisines. To me, the flavors were quite similar, although I have never had thai food presented the way it's done at Nonya. I'd love to be enlightened-- some sort of explanation about Indonesian cooking on the menu would be much appreciated. But I'm a nerd. All I do know is that the yellow curry soup was delicious, (albeit slightly mild, but hey, it is still Montreal) and the Sumatran stewed beef was so tender it  melted in my mouth-- peanut and curry flavors bursting with every bite. My man's duck confit came right off the bone- no need for a knife-- and had perfectly crispy skin. The mains were presented alongside rice in a beautiful banana-leaf basket, really delicious roasted eggplant, a big prawn cracker, some sort of cold slaw that was refreshing, and a craving-inducing sauce (on the side!) that reminded me of hoisin but was so much better. My only criticism has to be that the table d'hote ($27) includes a dessert, but when you get the dessert menu you are informed that everything but the rice pudding will run you an extra $3. Being non-rice-pudding-fans, we were fine to pay for an order of ice cream and creme brulee, but none too pleased when we were presented with 1 scoop of store-bought ice-cream and probably 3 tablespoons of creme brulee- though it was delicious. Felt a little scammy to us, but I guess that's what you get when you order table d'hote. We resolved to order off the a la carte menu next time. And we will be back again. I'm sick of going back to Ottawa every time I get a craving for coconut milk and curry."

From the bowl of garlicky peanuts served when we sat down, to the black rice pudding at the end, everything was fabulous - the gado gado salad; the amazing cornish hen in red curry; the spicy beef curry, every element of this surprisingly elaborate dish laid out separately - beautiful plating!The table d'hôte is reasonably priced, and there is a good selection of wines by the glass or carafe.The only thing that knocks Nonya down from five stars to four is the really, really long wait between courses.

The food took a little time to come out, but the wait was totally worth it. The food was amazing. If this is what authentic Indonesian food tastes like, then I love Indonesian food. The presentation of the food was remarkable. I enjoyed the flower shaped red pepper very much. Everything about the meal was worth every bit of money, especially the dessert. Excellent!!! At the end of the meal they gave us a coffee flavored candy called a Kopiko. Yum!!! This is a must go restaurant."
