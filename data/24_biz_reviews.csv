/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for a celebration dinner and loved it! No wait for two people at about 7pm on a Friday night. We tried a ton of stuff (the waiter even warned us it was maybe too much food) and everything was tasty. - Tomato salad with blue cheese and chickpeas - exactly that. I like all of those things so it was good and simple.- Ham croquettes -  creamy and smoky. - Short rib with kimchi - super tasty and came with toast to eat it on. - Scallops - came with bacon on a pea (and watercress I think?) puree. Great flavors and different from most scallop preparations I've had. - Scotch Egg - comes with two halves and pickled veggies. Probably the best scotch egg I've had because the yolk was soft boiled and the meat wasn't dried out.- Calamari - Big pieces with chilli sauce. Standard, can't go wrong.- Cauliflower - Cauliflower was just a big soggy, but it was very tasty.- Saltine crackers with caramel and chocolate - Good, although you can definitely make it at home. We were hoping to try the churros that I've seen so many pictures of on Yelp, but unfortunately they weren't available. I will say that after we ate all that (with a bottle of wine) we weren't *super* full - portions are small, but that's expected for tapas.Ambiance is dark and intimate, server was nice/helpful and went through the favorites with us, crowd is a bit older than many places in the Plateau. All in all a great experience!"
/user_details?userid=a_DzZ8Wtwn7sFhMb7yxLFA,Brenda A.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"Okay, so I don't think I have ever eaten at a 5 Star Yelp restaurant. I'm now hip. And this place deserves every star. The wait staff is so nice and gracious with their recommendations. We at first thought we were going to lose our reservation because our big group was running a little late. We called ahead, and they assured us our table would be waiting on us. It was. The food was so yummy. We had a little bread basket while we waited for all our orders. Maybe 2-3 per 2 person group would suffice. We definitely overdid it but wanted to try everything. The ham and cheese croquettes were prob my fave. I preferred them over the lobster ones. I wasn't a fan of the pork/kimchi combo. Maybe my palette isn't that experienced, but it was a little bland. The calamari was so good. We could have passed on the fish and chips as the fish wasn't all that. But the service and constant communication was great. The checks came out split perfectly. Just a great dining experience. Would love to come back."
/user_details?userid=PA4sKEXpXxWb5NXGZ7JTtg,Rosy L.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"A small friendly neighborhood restaurant serving Spanish-style tapas. I would call it a hidden gem in the Mont Royal area, lying fairly north of downtown Montreal. For drinks, we got cucumber mojitos. Such a good choice! It was super refreshing and I loved that there wasn't too much alcohol and we can actually taste the cucumber instead of being overwhelmed by the taste of rum. With a wide selection of tapas, you really cannot go wrong. The lobster croquettes and fried cauliflower were my absolute favorite! The croquettes were cooked to a crispy perfection on the outside, creamy on the inside- absolutely remarkable. The cauliflower was coated in truffle oil and cooked with finely minced mushrooms and scallions. A little squeeze of lemon on top for a bit of acidity and you've got an unique dish that is bursting with flavor.  The calamari was served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce that is far from the traditional marinara or tartar sauce. I love that they added their own spin to a well known and well loved dish. The poutine was an overload of short rib, gravy and starchy goodness. To top off a great meal, the churros are an absolute must. With a choice of dulce de leche or a chocolate sauce, the churros are a delicious crunchy sweet treat that will satisfy any sweet tooth.This place was absolutely amazing and was so well priced! I was quite shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night. 120% recommend Sorocc to anyone in Montreal!"

I ordered the cauliflower and it tasted amazing . Try it with their hot sauce and it was perfect. I ordered the pineapple vodka drink and it was like having a summer drink and felt soo good. The best part of this place is the staff, they were super friendly. Met the owner as well and got to hear their story for this restaurant and I felt a lot of positive vibes from them. Kudos to the team and would definitively recommend it."

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had read so many wonderful reviews on this resto that I had to try it with my foodie group of friends. Well 3 words AMAZING Mouth watering DELICIOUS FOOD!!!  Totally loved everything about this resto and surpassed my expectations! This cozy resto located on St-Denis street is a wonderful newcomer to the area. As soon as you enter the resto, the resto ambiance easily transports to Spain with it's beautiful decor and lovely latin music playing in the background. The music is not loud so perfect for having conversations. The food was impeccably delicious !!!  Beautifully plated dishes and each dish was packed with mouth watering flavors and made with super fresh ingrediants!  Very original tapas. Sorocco is a tapas resto and the best way to experience their cuisine is by ordering a couple of tapas and sharing !! We were a group of 10 so we each orderes two tapas and shared!  Super great food and prices are very reasonable! We ordered the beet salad with goat cheese, short rib terrine , grilled cauliflower, croquettes, lobster croquettes, scallops, grilled octopus all were DELICIOUS!! This is a great place for a night out with friends, romantic dinner, and birthday/anniversary celebrations! I must not forget to mention their dessert platter which was absolutely too die for! Churros covered in chocolate, praline chocolate cake and their fabulous chocolate pecan nuts covered squares!!! Now I must also mention the service which was the BEST I have experienced so far. The resto manager/owner was super attentive friendly and kind to say the least. He added to this memorable experience because he really did care about ensuring we had a great foodie experience!! I will definately go back to this resto that's for sure! I definately recommend this resto ..you must try it at least once! DEFINATELY a super great and amazing  foodie experience!"

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It can be really easy to miss the Sorocco experience on the busy St-Denis street. This establishment provides a Tapas style menu that I shared with my buddy. Here's my feedback :Calamari - Out of this world good!!! 5/5. The calamari were prepped PERFECTLY. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I was addicted to their slightly spicy Thai sweet sauce. It still resonates with me how GOOD it was.Poutine Bravas - Mediocre. 2/5. Truth be told we ordered this for the Bravas name and not for the poutine. I loved eating Bravas potatoes while visiting Spain and while the sour cream and sauce were right putting it in a.... poutine was a letdown. Also it was slightly cold which makes a poutine experience less than desirable. Please consider Bravas fries.Fried Cauliflower in Truffle Oil - Very good. 4/5. Originally just OK but my appreciation for this dish changed the more I ate it!Paella for 2 - Very good. 4/5. The plate is very generous and could easily feed 4 people! I love paella and the dish hit the spot minus the rice tasting a little under-cooked.Cucumber Mojito - Average. 3/5. It held too much alcohol and not enough taste to make me enjoy a cucumber Mojito. Truth be told, the tapas outshined this drink.For dessert...Caramel Sale, pecan chocolate cookies : Perfect! 5.5. That sweet and sour taste was the real deal. It was provided on the house, so kudos for that!Mini-Churros with caramel sale : Very good! 4/5. Would give 5/5 if it wasn't mini.....mini and standard size taste quite different. It was crunchy but I like the softness of the inside and it was missed.Service was great all night long. Our waitress was sweet and made the whole experience very welcoming. 5 STARS!Price tag is about $40 per person which gives it decent value. I expect tables of 4 can really try out a huge amount of dishes.In conclusion, an experience you must have. Would go back!"

Don't even bother continuing to read this just GO!The service was phenomenal. Both the manager and the bartender went above and beyond to make sure I was having a great experience.The food more than spoke for itself. -I sampled both the Serrano, and the Lobster Croquetas (normally they come 2 to an order but the manager graciously offered to get me one of each) which were heavenly. If I had to choose my favourite, the Serrano would take the cake.-I tried the Fried Cauliflower with Truffle Oil, which was as delicious as it sounds.-I also had the Beets (which come with goat cheese and a light dressing), these were as good as the above-mentioned items, and come highly recommended, rightfully so.To top it off, when I was winding down the wonderful manager brought over some sweet snacks (think a chocolate and toffee-ish bark of sorts) on the house to 'keep me busy' while I read my book and had some tea.Overall great experience. The gentleman next to me had the Shrimp a la Plancha which looked and smelled OUT of this world, I'll definitely be back to try it :)"

/user_details?userid=Dv8_yG3TJcHshtsAsQUWWA,Sarah M.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Best tapas I've ever had. We were in Montréal for 3 days and got smoked meat and poutine, some of the more traditional dishes, but Sorocco was probably some of my favorite food on the trip. Everything was reasonably priced and delicious. We started with the Lobster croquettes, which I would have ordered another round if I wasn't so full. Next was the fried cauliflower with truffles - AMAZING! We also had the Fried Calamari, which comes with a sweet chili sauce that pairs perfectly, and ended with the vegetable medley. We also got the Cucumber Mojitos, which were surprisingly good, and a Bloody Caesar. I would have ordered it all again and gone back a 2nd time if we were there longer. Service was very friendly and helpful too."
/user_details?userid=Yx8RqQSI8cO4jfW7VKw4Kw,Craig C.,"New Egypt, Plumsted Township, NJ",3 star rating,"Our dining experience here was A-OK. Sorocco was right around the corner from the apartment we were staying at in Montreal, and the reviews made it seem like a no brainer to come here. We were the first ones in for dinner service, and we managed to snag a nice table right by the front window. The owner and waiters were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The person who I assume to be the owner took his time to walk us through the entire menu, make recommendations, and introduce us to how this restaurant does things.We ordered four plates - the Serrano Croquetas, Meatballs, Fried Calamari, and Scotch Eggs. For me, the Scotch Eggs were the high point - semi-soft boiled quail eggs encased in a flavorful, spicy sausage and breadcrumb mixture. The eggs were well seasoned and hit just the right amount of spice. The texture was fantastic. The Fried Calamari was sliced in a unique way I hadn't seen before and fried to perfection. It was very good, but I think it could have been even better with a little bit more of the sweet chili sauce. This was probably my second favorite. The Serrano Croquetas came in third, flavorful but not warmed up enough in the center in my opinion. Lastly, the meatballs. They were tasty and I enjoyed them, but they didn't blow me away. Overall, we had a good meal and are happy we came to Sorocco."

We called around 6 and they were able to get us in at 8:30, which was great. We did the pre-fixe menu and it was exceptional!! All of the tapas we had were amazing and the meal was very well-paced. We were all so full at the end, and we rarely feel full from the overpriced tapas we have in NYC! The staff was so accommodating from start to finish and we couldn't have asked for a better first meal in Montreal."

Sorocco is a cozy restaurant (with outdoor seating) on a strip with lots of shops and restaurants. We never waited long to be seated and service was prompt and attentive. We ordered the house salad, veggies, calamari, meats, truffle cauliflower (takes a while to come out but well worth the wait) and some other apps. Food was very good and we were stuffed before the cauliflower came out. On the 2nd visit, we each ordered the cauliflower to avoid sharing, haha. Cocktails were good, too. Great restaurant in the Mount Royal area."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was a sunny warm Sunday and I was walking on a busy St-Denis street looking for a terrace where I could have some drinks with friends. If you know St-Denis well as I do, you know it's not an easy task to find a good spot because it sure does gets crowded on the weekends. And to my surprise I found this place with a small but cute terrace and even nicer decor inside.Their menu consist of tapas with a Scottish/Moroccan touch (because of the owners) and the food is wonderful! The service is also amazing, when we asked if they had a sangria, they made a very nice fruity sangria for us even though it wasn't on the menu just yet. I was really impressed with the service, the food and so did my friends. This place is surely on my ""places to go on sunny weekends list""."

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Had a so so experience here. The good: portions are generous for tapas style, and prices are reasonable. The ham croquetas (3 per order) were nice and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Very little ham, mostly a (tasty) bechamel sauce filled the little balls. But still our favorite of the night. The bad: service is very scattered, the owner welcomed us and explained the menu (a good thing), but was a little too forceful in insisting we try certain dishes. We don't like beets, but he insisted we must have the beet salad, and that he would bring us a small free side dish of the salad we really wanted to get (which never came), but we must have the beets. So we got the beets lol. In his defense, it was pretty good, but again, we don't really like the texture or taste of that veg and we ended up leaving almost half uneaten and picking out the yummy goat cheese. The ultimate vibe I got from this place is that it has a bit of an identity crisis. The calamari dish we ordered had a sweet Thai chili sauce. Why??? The calamari was ok, not super crispy like I prefer, and probably would have garnered a 4/5 from me if it had a good sauce, but this way, 3/5 at most. The short rib poutine was probably my least favorite, 2/5 because 1)the fries were soft, lame, and unseasoned, and 2) again, with the ""inventive"" mixing of different cuisines, had kimchi mixed into the pulled short rib and gooey cheese (the last twp ingredients being good on their own). Why why why? We also had the pil pil shrimp, which were 8 small shrimp in a garlic sauce. It was good but not great, and this one really deserve some crusty bread to sop up all the garlic sauce. There is also a scotch egg dish listed on the menu in a nod to the chef's background, which also seemed out of place to me. Lastly, we had the raved about cauliflower with truffle oil. My dining partner liked it, I felt it was nothing special, not seasoned or fried enough. A few tweaks could have made this a good dish.Cocktails should also be avoided here. They are affordable but really light on alcohol. Your best bet is a bottle or glass of wine. The pours are generous on those. I can see this place being popular for a date night, since it's fun to share a bunch of dishes and it's affordable and has a liquor license. With that said, something was too off for me to want to go back, and the identity crisis rubbed me the wrong way."

For drinks, I had pineapple lion, which was really nice. We ordered cauliflower, lobster croquettes, shrimp and kefta mini burgers. The owner highly recommended the croquettes and he wasn't wrong, they're sooooo good. The cauliflower is scrumptious as well. The other two things were good as well but not as good as the croquettes and the cauliflower. My husband & I especially loved the churros with Nutella. I wish I could have them right now"

Our AirBnB host recommended the location and we were so pleased. If you're traveling from the states and nervous about your rusty French, be assured that they speak English and Spanish. The chef is an absolute artist and all the tapas selections were exquisitely prepared and perfectly portioned. We had the cauliflower, braised short rib, Serrano croquetas, octopus, and chocolate/salted caramel bark. There is in and outdoor seating available and the service was excellent. Servers as well as the owner went out of their way to explain the menu, make recommendations (even though everything is a must have), and make us feel at home. It's obvious they have passion and love for what they do here. We will be back!"

While the tapas selection isn't exactly traditional (scotch eggs, but no tortilla), every dish and drink we had was delicious. We had the Lobster Croquettes, Scotch Eggs, and short rib, and they were all phenomenal.

Sometimes Spanish tapas places can get expensive because they're small and you're still hungry and want to eat more.

/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",5 star rating,"Two things make this place special, creative ideas coming from the kitchen and genuine friendly service.  This is the sort of place that would quickly sort of feel like family, so very much wish this was a local place for me.  But at least we had a chance to enjoy the hospitality and yummy food during our vacation. The interior disinviting and stylish to my take.  We started with some great wine and got down to order interesting things.  Everyone raves about the cauliflower, and rightly so.  This is a nearly perfect treat.  I would order this every time no matter what!  The croquettes are nicely done and a good take on a traditional item.  The scallops were amazing as well. Nicely seared with a puree and lovely crisp and salty pork.  To be honest I can't remember if it was bacon or not, but the trick with the scallops is you need a bit of each item in the dish to make it work.  All three tastes combine make this a special dish, so be sure to eat it that way.  WE also had the short rib terrine which was fine, but not as wow as the other two things.  But this is also about exploring ideas, and sometimes it might not work for everyone, but the courage to try create non-traditional tapas and put them out there is appreciated.  A bowl of yummy chocolate brittle was a perfect way to end the meal.  Just wish I could go back and have more cauliflower and work my way through the menu.  Locals, take note!  Go here and support them so when I come back to town I can again enjoy Claire's creations and Driss' friendly and joyful spirt."

We also had the beet salad which had a generous portion of goat cheese on it and was my husband's favorite.

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You know...when I saw the crazy 5 star review for Sorocco I was excited but skeptical that it could really be that good. Nonetheless, I was intrigued enough to take my hubby there for his birthday dinner and was delighted when I was able to score a 6pm Saturday night dinner there a few weeks ago. We were very quickly seated upon arrival in this cute and cozy little restaurant and I remember being surprised that only a couple tables were occupied. After going through the menu with one of the co-owners (lovely gentleman who was very honest in telling us that 4-5 tapas were enough to share rather than overselling), we settled on the Scotch Eggs, asparagus, garlic shrimp, ham and cheese croquetas and the octopus. I won't even go into all the detail because everything was literally phenomenal here. The Scotch eggs were unlike any other I've ever had. The shrimp was delicious. The croquetas made me want to live inside them for eternity. The octopus was perfectly cooked, and the asparagus was super yummy. We were hoping to have more space for dessert but unfortunately, the portions sizes are so generous that we couldn't stomach any more food. That being said, the price for the above and 3 cocktails including tax and tip came to $110 which, given the quality of the food was very fair. I seriously cannot recommend Sorocco enough, and personally can't wait to go back and try other items off their menu (although the croquetas are 200% going to happen again!). Amazing experience, food, service, and everything else in between! 10 stars! (ps. by the time we left ~7:30 the entire restaurant was at capacity so definitely make reservations if you plan to drop by on a weekend)"

We were in Montreal looking for apartments before our move there this summer and chose this place based on location and Yelp reviews. Although expectations were high, the restaurant exceeded expectations! We loved every. single. dish. What's more - portions are big for tapas and priced very reasonably.I started with a cucumber mojito. The small pieces of cucumber were like bursts of freshness in my mouth!The sorocco salad was made with extremely fresh vegetables and was topped with a generous portion of manchego cheese. The croquetas were crunchy on the outside with warm melted cheese inside. I have never had calamari like those here! The pieces were very meaty and cooked well, with breading to compliment, instead of overpower, the main feature. If you want one recommendation from the menu, definitely go for the fried cauliflower! I was worried we were getting too many fried items, but the cauliflower was not deep fried. It was cooked perfectly, with generous amounts of truffle oil.We finished with the churros and, although good, I would highly recommend the house made cookie, which was served to us to sample. To call it a cookie does not do this dessert justice, in my opinion. It starts with a layer of dark chocolate, followed by caramel, and finished with a short bread cookie type base. We received excellent service from the owner of the restaurant who spent time welcoming us to Montreal and telling us about all of the things he loves about the city!"

Service was very accommodating, friendly and attentive. Everything was fantastic from start to finish. The olives and pickled veggies (bread & butter style) were a perfect start. Portions were very generous. The beet salad was fresh w a generous helping of goat cheese. The fries were FANTASTIC (just missing typical Spanish Brava sauce). Shrimp were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Croquetas were massive, and crispy and creamy in all the right ways. Cauliflower was the least impressive of the dishes we ordered, but still enjoyable. Highly recommend this spot!"

The atmosphere was very much in line wth the neighborhood. Nicely priced. We ordered the beet salad, olives, short rib poutine, fried cauliflower, and calamari. A set back is the order the dishes came out. It should be lightest to heaviest. The poutine was brought out in the middle which was jarring to the palate and harder to pair wine. The short rib poutine was the best dish. The combination of savory meat with sweet salty kimchi was delicious. However, the beet salad was just beets and goat cheese. A two note dish. Lacking a bed of greens. The fried cauliflower with truffle oil while a good effort lacked the sweet acid to elevate it such as a balsamic vinegar or lemon juice. Calamari was cooked perfectly and accompanied with a nice spicy sweet and sour sauce. Would have been nice if served in a shallow dish so it not infringe on the crispy calamari."

The service was exceptional, with wait staff on hand to very quickly remove empty plates, refill water glasses and replace our plates with fresh ones after the salad. We accidentally ordered something with something I'm allergic to in it on the recommendation of our server and when he realized, he went way out of his way to accommodate and ensure that I had what I needed to be fully satisfied with my meal. It was truly lovely of him and went way above and beyond what I would expect. I would highly recommend Sorocco to anyone in Montreal or anyone passing through.

The cocktails menu was also underwhelming, i think there were only 4 or 5 choices.So overall, not bad but not that good either.

We arrived relatively early, at 5:30 pm on a Friday and the restaurant was empty, but that did not bother us, since they placed us in a nook of the restaurant, and the music was playing relatively loudly, which made us feel very cozy. The restaurant was half full by the time we left at around 7 pm.Coming into this place, I absolutely wanted to try the cauliflower, based on the great yelp reviews. However, my boyfriend is not a big fan, and I informed the waiter of this, who promptly reassured him that even people who hate cauliflower LOVE the cauliflower dish that they make. He then brought us a small portion of the cauliflower, and said that the dish would be on him if we did not like it. My boyfriend devoured half the plate! The cauliflower was doused in a generous amount of olive oil and seasoned to perfection! We also had the beet salad, which was a generous portion, and again, my boyfriend does not like beets, but he liked this salad nonetheless. And the waiter did not charge us for the cauliflower!Right before leaving, the waiter gave us a small portion of chocolate butterscotch bark, which was delicious. Really an incredible experience."

Being 1/2 of a young couple, we enjoyed the overall atmosphere, service, and price of the entire restaurant. The dim lighting, decorations, and entire ambiance felt very intimate--and created an illusion of expense. To our surprise, the food was very reasonably priced and affordable, everything felt as if it were a bargain.The service was impeccable! A willing and kind host created a comfortable atmosphere and the server (who was the manager) delivered exceptional service. The food, to top everything off, was absolutely delightful. Server had an incredible recommendation to go light on the tapas due to the heavy portion size, and go for three tapas and a salad to share for two. It was absolutely perfect.The calamari, to begin, was beautifully seasoned and breaded. It contained a sweet yet savory sauce. The highlight of the tapas was the cauliflower with truffle oil. The lightness contrasted exceptionally well with the heavy taste of other tapas.Being tourists and finding this place on a whim was quite the fantasy.

Once I informed the waiter of our necessary departure time, he arranged the delivery of tapas in perfectly timed intervals that left us unrushed but ahead of schedule.

The croquetas and flavorful short ribs were outstanding and the calamari with Asian inspired dipping sauce was delicious.

He even let us sample a few of their wines to help us decide which one we wanted.We ended up ordering the house salad (delicious dressing, and sprinkled with manchego) , croquetas, cauliflower and their special poutine (with tomato sauce and cheese). They were all equally tasty, but I must recommend the cauliflower and the 'poutine'. The waiter kept checking in on us, and constantly refilling our water. Although we were completely stuffed by the end of the meal, I am happy that we found some extra space for some complementary pieces of dark chocolate with caramel and seasalt. What a treat!

Just a simple error and was comped for the salad. Ordered: Sorocco salad, short rib terrine, scallops, veggies of the day, shrimp, and scotch eggs. Scallops were likely the best of all the dishes, but for value, I would pick the short rib. For tapas the price is good, and you can order a decent amount of food for two for about $50."

They have a few items that are vegetarian, cauliflower truffle is very good, they give a lot of olives, and the bread (baguette) tastes fresh and is crunchy. Don't forget to dip your bread in the truffle sauce, it's exquisite! This place is not too loud and is great for accommodating groups and people with various allergies by letting you know what you can consume and what you can't.

/user_details?userid=-OwkM7YDnPbwGxiKd7rptw,Jeff G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Get there quick before this hidden gem becomes an overcrowded hot-spot. I read about Sorocco on MTL Blog and figured I'd give it a shot. Truthfully, it wasn't the first choice on our list, but none of the other places had space for a last-minute reservation. Our party of 4 arrived around 8 on a Friday night to an empty restaurant... literally, empty. We weren't sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised. In the true spirit of a tapas restaurant, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share:Fried cauliflower with truffle oil: So simple, yet so delicious... 'nough said! Croquetas: This cheesy goodness was a nice bite, but could have used a little more seasoning to balance the deep-fried exterior.Piri Piri shrimp: Perfectly cooked shrimp in a chili-based sauce... I'll be back for more of that!Meatballs: Super moist meatballs in a sauce approved by Italians! Ask the waiter for extra bread to soak up the leftover sauce. You won't regret it. Scallops: I'm a big fan of scallops. These were cooked exactly as they should be, but they were missing a little something. Not my favorite dish, but definitely a strong contender with a little fix.Scotch eggs: Deep-fried, chorizo-wrapped quail egg with a cherry sherry sauce... It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty with a touch of heat and a well-cooked quail egg. Definitely one of the top dishes. Niçoise Salad: Surprisingly, really good. They served the salad after all the tapas had come. The salad was really light and had a nice acidity to cleanse the palate. I highly recommend it. Seafood paella: Having been to Spain, I've eaten my fair share of paella from different regions. I had really high expectations for the paella at Sorocco, but it certainly fell short. The rice was excellent but could have used a little more flavor. It was really the seafood that left me underwhelmed. Like the scallops, a couple small changes will make this dish a big hit.  Sure, there is room for improvement but, in its entirety, the food was delicious and we didn't leave hungry. We especially enjoyed how each item was brought out separately. It gave us the opportunity to taste each tapas without feeling rushed to get to the next one. We'll be back soon to try the menu items we missed! Without a doubt, the service was impeccable. The owner took the time to explain the menu, the waiter was knowledgeable and attentive to detail (filling up water before we had the chance to realize our water was empty, changing plates between the tapas and the main dishes, etc.), and they were both courteous. Seeing as we were the only table in the restaurant for the better half of our meal (a party of about 15 people came to the restaurant just as we were half way through), the real question is how well they will handle a full house (the restaurant seats about 50 people, with a few more at the bar). The restaurant has only been open for a few months, so they are still working out a few details (a cocktail menu, for example). Being in a prime location on St. Denis, I'm sure they'll do just fine, especially when they open their terrace in the summer."

We had the olives, house fries, meatballs, fried cauliflower, chicken sliders, marinated veges, and the fried calamari. The fried cauliflower (w/truffle oil) were great, and the calamari were quite different than I have ever had them, They were sliced not in rings, but in rectangles, which kept them light. The chef has a way with the fryer! Since we came early and Montreal seems to be a later night dining city, we chatted a bit with the owner Driss, who helped us select wines and talked a bit about his partner's techniques in the kitchen.

/user_details?userid=r-XBMSPOMoJ11ecKmXzMyg,Pedro C.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We went with a group of 8 people (4 couples).  The owner greeted us and went over the menu.  At all times it felt relaxed and not forced.  He was warm and very passionate about the food and ensuring everyone had a good time.  Interesting cultural mix - owner is from Moroccan decent and his partner (the chef) is Scottish.  Hence the name of the restaurant is a combo.  The food mainly Spanish style tapas with a twist.  We all like to eat and cook and I say this in pure honesty ... food was fantastic!!!  We had the chucuterie to start which had olives, jamon Serrano, chorizo, manchego cheese and pickled vegetables.  We ordered 6 tapas:  cauliflower with truffle oil (amazing), croquetas de jamon, beet salad with goat cheese (really good), calamari (tender and not greesy), short ribs (stewed and just melted on the toast), scallops (sweet and cooked perfectly).  The churros with chocolate for dessert (wow!!!  What a way to finish...crunchy and gooey in the middle).  One of the best meals lve had in a while, with interesting plates and there is nothing I did not like.  The place has a chilled out vibe and the servers and host are so nice.  The bill was the other surprise...only ended up being $50 a person...extremely good value for the quality of food.  Also noting we had wine and drinks too!  A big time Recommend!!"

The portion size and value is great with polite service to match. It was only me dining so I had leftover which I can't wait to dig into later!"
/user_details?userid=pfdX2jsD1n1O0LmWtfnSPg,Maggie B.,"Lewisburg, PA",5 star rating,Literally the best meal of my life. Wait staff was friendly and we never had to ask for a single thing (except an extra order of poutine to take home). Food came out promptly and everything was DELICIOUS.  I'm a vegetarian and to find a place that has enough options to stay interesting while having quality meat dishes for the meat eaters is very rare. 100% recommend!!!!

Our favorites were the fried cauliflower, beet salad and the Scotch eggs. It's a perfect spot for an intimate dinner, or a great place to sample some tasty tapas with friends. If you're in the neighborhood, stop and sample!"
/user_details?userid=uaxXLgfeAbNb6UFw52psmw,Drew D.,"Miami Beach, FL",5 star rating,Stopped in for dinner last night with a group of 6. Chose restaurant in large part based on the Yelp review. Did not disappoint. Great service and the food was solid. Tapas style. Some modern takes. Chicken burger sliders spiced like harissa. Great calamari with a sweet chili sauce. Roasted Cauliflower with truffle oil. And the lobster croquettes which were mentioned in an earlier review. All were really good. Highly recommend and agree with 5 star rating.
/user_details?userid=V-poB1NWBCgHxP0i6-HqaA,Corissa S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Bonjour! We are visiting Montreal and stopped in for dinner- so glad we did! Our waiter (who happened to be the co-owner) took the time to walk us through all of the dishes and make recommendations. The food was excellent- I recommend the croquettes and calamari as standouts- and service was impeccable. The atmosphere was homey and inviting. Definitely recommend!
/user_details?userid=6EFfWpR_IDEsvS2nCGlrrg,Samantha R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the first sunny evenings of the year, a few friends and I were looking for a terrasse to enjoy the weather on. We were so pleasantly surprised to find such an amazing and surprisingly quiet venue. Not only was the service amazing but the food blew us all out of the water! The croquetas, calamari and beet salad are not to be missed but truly the paella was the star of the night. A little off the beaten path, this place is worth it for the ambience and the care that clearly goes into all their awesomely fresh dishes. Please, if you're on the fence, don't hesitate!"
