Tasty and traditional.Fried chicken kaarage was tasty, we added truffle mayo on the side.Smoked trout croquettes is a great fusion dish.Pork bun and ursin ramen with bone marrow was a hit.Overall our favourite dish, believe it or not, was the brussel sprouts. Perfectly cripsy, sweet and sour, topped with almonds."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,Pretty disappointed! Heard really good things about this restaurant so was excited to try it out.Started with chicken karage ~ definitely far from the best one I tried. The chicken was under-seasoned and not crispy at all. I don't think the chicken was even dipped in any batter.Soft shell crab bao - ok but not wow. I would have like it to have some pickled vegetables to cut the oilyness of the crab.Octopus carpaccio - decent.Noodles with bone marrow and uni ~ like the texture of the noodles as they were springy. Wished there was more uni on the dish as it was pricey! Would have liked it slightly more seasoned.The best items were the nigiri with wagyu and uni on top. Melted in your mouth but it is $15/piece.Overall I thought it was pricey for the food you get. WillNot go back.

It all started with Otto yakitori on St-Mathieu, then Otto bistro in Mont-Royal and now finally the best of both worlds in St-Henri.The decor is beautiful, minimalistic and with the perfect touch of upscale look. The greenery of the bar compliments their furniture. The bar gives people a cozy kind of feeling!To start, we ordered the uni sashimi and the sashimi platter. All the sashimis were extremely  fresh and well worth the cost. As for tapas, we ordered the eggplant, the karaage and the chicken skins. The eggplant was the perfect salty and spicy marinate. It had these little crunchy pieces which made the perfect pair with the soft texture of the eggplant. The karaage were very big pieces; crispy on the outside, tender  on the inside. Oh... for the chicken skins.... always amazing!!!!! Lastly the duck confit mazemen... delicious delicious, a must if you come here! You will not be disappointed!!! Extremely tender, tasteful and beautifully presented!!! If you love Otto yakitori and Otto bistro, you  will love love love Bar Otto"

We shared the eggplant, spicy ikura mazemen, the croquette, the sashimi platter and some skewers. They were all pretty good and the presentation was nice. My personal faves are the chicken skin skewers and the croquettes. The menu consists of tapas so the portions aren't big as they're meant to be shared. Our final amount was around 45-52$ after tax per person depending on the drink we got. It is definitely pricey considering that we weren't full. As for the service, the food came pretty quickly and the staff were nice and friendly. The inside doesn't feel like a japanese restaurant at all. I would probably come back to try some of their other stuff but I will definitely try to order something more filling to avoid being hungry. Make sure you reserve before coming if it's on a weekend!"
