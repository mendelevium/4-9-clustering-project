/user_details?userid=DZl6ln-FpcTaeuDZXwdBjQ,Michelle M.,"Fort Myers, FL",5 star rating,Lunch special is a good deal. Food portions are very generous (similar to family size/normal sizing). Everything came out when it was fresh made so food was piping hot. We both enjoyed our meal and they now offer free coffee or tea for orders over $10. Parking is a bit difficult but we will be back when we're in town again.

I really 100% recommend this place, food is decently priced  and the cooks are crazy fast. Great for a fast delicious lunch. Friendly waiter went above and beyond for our table.The place isn't fancy but sit your ass down and choose one of the many delicious options on the menu. We went with the Fried Pork, Sizzling Beef and Shanghai Noodles. I liked them in that exact order. The Fried Pork kept calling to me. Huge generous plates. Would love to go back and try more things on their menu!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"Chez Chen offers exceptional value for lunch. For only 9.99$, you get a soup, two spring rolls, assorted vegetables, rice, and choice of a main dish (for example: braised pork, sesame beef, etc.)I came one day at 1pm. The restaurant was not busy, with only two patrons. I was warmly greeted and offered tea as soon as I sat down. My food arrived swiftly after ordering. The taste was adequate, what you would expect from an cafeteria style Chinese restaurant. I ordered the lunch special with braised pork north-eastern style. The portions were generous and service was professional. All things considered, I highly recommend this restaurant especially for lunch. At 9.99, what more can you ask?"
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went with friends, not really sure what they ordered but their choice of food wasn't really for me. The dishes were fine but not the type of food I prefer. The food included - egg plant and tofu dish, intestines, a spicy meat,etc. The service was quick but it wasn't a busy time that we went. Not sure if I would come again."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A small and cozy restaurant. They offer Chinese northeast cuisine and also some Sichuan dishes. We go here and meet friends regularly. Last time we had five dishes, and we like them all, big portion and very tasty . However, sometimes the quality of dishes falls to stay the same. I recommend spicy chicken, fish in a hot pot, cumin lamb, pickled cabbage pork stew, jelly noodle salad and sour&spicy potato slice (here are the Chinese names in case you know some 辣子鸡 冷锅鱼 孜然羊肉 酸菜炖猪肉 凉拌拉皮 酸辣土豆丝）It can get very busy in the weekends. They also have delivery service and special lunch menu."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another very authentic northern Chinese food. It's not a place where you want to go for hot and sour soup, general tao chicken or orange beef. Here are my suggestions, orange sauce pork chop is something very similar general tao. It's  sour and little bit sweet. Spicy fried beans, very tasty, goes very well with rice. On a side note, you get free drinks when you order $50 or over."
/user_details?userid=52mDBK9w-66v519SMGCuvA,Dominic Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, what a hidden gem! The Chinese food here has the same quality as those real Chinese food you may find in a quality Chinese restaurant in China. I just wanna taste everything! And with such a reasonable price, such a big portion?! Such a clean and tidy place as well. I would say the food here are way more diverse even than those in Chinatown, The stuffs feel very approachable and down to earth as well.Now I know where to go if I wanna taste some authentic and quality Chinese food!"
/user_details?userid=8EclJ24l7H0J-GC5tvegcg,Léonie L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Like their lunch menu. 9,99$ for generous portions + soup. Many choices. Fast service. Friendly staff. I enjoy the little greens beans they give for free as a side dish. I love the chicken and potatoes dish. :) the potatoes are very juicy. If I want a good warm wonton soup, it's where I go. I like their broth and noodles.The only down side is that sometimes dishes are a bit too oily."
/user_details?userid=oVPbzxI8LwrITLIjzibHJQ,Snay H.,"Union City, CA",5 star rating,Their eggplant dish was utterly phenomenal and i'm not even vegetarian! My fiancé got the pork intestines and loved it
/user_details?userid=d3XucpqiUUVh5xEuHyRN1Q,Claire B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Super fast and delicious food! Service is friendly. Great value for the lunch special. One of my go-tos.
/user_details?userid=UiU_yqwSQwTZdw3vxD_Aag,Helene M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great new place for Chinese food! The prices are very reasonable and portions very hearty! Add that a tasteful and original plates, and you have a recipe for success! Good job Chez Chen! Besides, the service is quick and very nice too!"
/user_details?userid=OmenEF__2aGuCondL9olbw,Sheiny S.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is ok. Not the worst northern Chinese food I've had, but not the best either. Restaurant is clean and bright with friendly servers. The moment I sat down they brought me a mug of complimentary tea which I thought was nice. This place is not fancy at all though, white metal chairs and lots of people in sweats. Would be good for a hungover meal! I started with some wonton soup. The wontons themselves were very mediocre, but I thought the broth had nice flavor and the shaved cucumber in it was an interesting touch. I also had shanghai noodles, green beans with minced pork, and sautéed lamb on a sizzling hot plate. I ordered vegetarian noodles as I had two meat dishes and they were disappointing. Very bland, and apparently ""with vegetables"" means three pieces of bok choi for the whole dish. Green beans were tasty, although I found the pork that was with them to be dry and not seasoned well. The lamb had solid flavor, this was probably my favourite dish. Even though I didn't love all of the dishes that I ordered, I would come back again because it was a pleasant dining experience and there were a few more things on the menu that I would like to try!"
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Really authentic chinese restaurant, not the kind that makes western chinese food. A lot of what they offer on their menu cannot be found easily in other chinese restaurant as they offer really authentic northern chinese food.They restaurant is pretty small and it gets packed easily, so if you are a big group of people and you don't want to wait, then you better make a reservation.I ordered 鱼子豆腐茄子煲 (eggplant and japanese tofu) and I loved the eggplants in it: soft and juicy in the inside and the outside has a little sofy crisp. However the tofu was really bad, the tofu skin tasted really powdery...The 冷锅鱼 (similar to a small spicy fish hotpot) was probably the best dish of the meal. Never had fish like that before. They serve you with tofu and some vegetables to go with the fish stew, a bit like a hotpot concept. The 锅包肉 (porc coated with sweet sauce) was too sweet imo, and I always thought 锅包肉 was porc coated with flour and fried though...We also ordered a new dish of their menu: 竹筒血豆腐 (tofu and porc blood in bamboo). There was barely any porc blood, but it tasted okay. The servings are just average. It is a nice restaurant, and their menu is huge so I guess I will be back to try some other dishes"
/user_details?userid=pQoIg9wZS3JxREZD9eX1fg,K P.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"This place is awesome! We enjoyed ourselves so much we came back the next day before leaving town. We had the green beans with pork, General Tao's chicken and Szechuan chicken. All three were very good! The place was full of families and groups so it was very lively. All of the staff were very friendly and very patient."
/user_details?userid=ARSjPhYrvOmh9JEuMo2yAA,Itsuko H.,"Cardinal, Canada",5 star rating,I definitely love their food. The pork hand is delicious and is my girlfriend's favorite. I like the vegetable fried rice. And they have lovely free cold dishes and drinks.
/user_details?userid=uX4fWGcaYIPTMQ_UMkWxIQ,Zihan T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favourite Chinese restaurant in Montreal. They have northeastern Chinese food which tastes quite good. The portion is large for the price and the boss is a nice person.
/user_details?userid=eNORuY4cjyQStMygVSSYZQ,Meimei Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Chez Chen offers a diverse range of dishes from northern China. The prices are fair for the portions and you will find yourself indulging in many unique dishes that are not found in typical Chinese diners. They offer a discount when you pay in cash, and also give out free drinks when you spend over a certain amount. For sure one of my favourite places to go for some comfort food"

Firstly it is very close to my home, and secondly, their food is really tasty and authentic. The service is very friendly too and the serving is speedy so you won't wait too long for your order."
/user_details?userid=phsc3ZiKU_aH7i4BxNqKUg,Coco L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Chinese restaurant in downtown, better than all the others. It is famous for the cuisine in north-east China, also spicy food. The price is very reasonable and the service is fast. Don't miss it if you have opportunity to have a try!"
/user_details?userid=YAjCGTAreWvmX-KnDj3UVg,Brad J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My favourite place for authentic North Chinese food. The owner and staff are great. I love it...

/user_details?userid=wc_S-BmpJv_cGgLhoEju6g,Xu Z.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,小鸡炖蘑菇 （稍微咸点儿），木须肉，竹筒血豆腐都非常好吃！ Personally I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in downtown Montreal. I give it a better rating than Ritz-Carleton and other high-end French dinings. Surprised and amazed and blessed to find this restaurant.
/user_details?userid=wT873xegSM080vMe6mUV-g,Chen S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this spot on Valentine's Day night. Surprisingly, most of other decent downtown restaurants were closed by 10pm on a Saturday night. This one closes late at 11pm, which, in my opinion, fits well with the schedule and life style of the downtown community. Hot tea was immediately served once we sat down, with two appetizers: both, of course, home made. One of them is some crispy snack. Traditional Chinese style equivalent of nacho/chips. Taste was amazing, with the right amount of spices. We ordered a traditional DongBei stew: pork ribs, flat bean and potatoes. It's exactly how authentic DongBei cuisine tastes like. I was very surprised and impressed by both the quantity and quality of it.  Honest ingredients and cooking. On the menu, you will find a lot of other DongBei cuisine options with very good price. The decor is different than your typical Chinese restaurants, with bright orange paint, open kitchen concept, feels very clean and open sitting inside. A larger TV on the wall, and most importantly, it's NOT playing Chinese drama or boring news. They were playing hockey that night when we were there. The staff were all very friendly and took care of our table w/o being overbearing. I'd definitely go back to try out more food!"
/user_details?userid=8atrOT1GosSFm6QPdhuV9Q,Alli L.,"Hoboken, NJ",2 star rating,"Wow.  I was so disappointed with my take-out.  It was bland, didn't salt the vegetables and got my order wrong with a salad that was utterly inedible which I had to throw away.  That was money down the drain. I'm Chinese and I know my Chinese food!"
/user_details?userid=f4Ro-CMacH59954mFxsqbQ,Mattias L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very delicious and palatable restaurant. Definitely worth a visit! Order the lamb and also the fish!
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was tipped off to this place by a Chinese friend, who was surprised by how authentic and awesome the food was here. I ordered the crispy pork with sweet and sour sauce at her recommendation, and szechuan green beans with minced pork, as I was in the mood for something spicy. Both were delicious and came in a very generous portion. They offered us complimentary appetizer as well, which was spicy Edamame stir fried with some other vegetables (sorry can't recall, but it was darn good). Overall the cuisine here is more on the spicy side, so if you like that, that's good. Otherwise ask the server to make it less spicy for you."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is my newfound casual Chinese go-to restaurant. The service is extremely fast, the portions are big and it's not too salty or greasy and the price is right. It's not fancy at all, but for a quick weeknight meal, it is perfect. Also, they serve quite  few northern Chinese dishes that can't be found in other restaurants."
/user_details?userid=ezKix3wPetRFc1LD9ryCNA,Wei J.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",3 star rating,"I like the bullfrog dish, it's my favourite, the rest of dishes are just fine similar to other Chinese restaurant.  The service is bad tho, been there couples time they waiters will never ask our opinions and not even notice us, have to put up the hand for so long even when it's not busy. Like they never pay attention. Beside the service it's not bad place."
/user_details?userid=a2Sex6hkIghOYG5CzmMvvA,Johnn I.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"waiting at the counter for a takeout, the cook answered his cell while perparing. a few mins later, when the cashier asking staffs if anyone had change for $20 which i paid, he again reached for his wallet bare handed and went on perparing the next second. this is what i call DISGUSTING"
/user_details?userid=1NtBKCmdlPC48FsZtPiF6Q,F J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Real classy place. Offered tea or water immediately upon being seated along with a quick home-style appetizer. The dishes are prepared in an open kitchen and while it takes time, you appreciate it because it is fresh. The batter on the general tao was fresh and the sauce for the Shanghai noodles was not laden with sodium and rich in flavour. The best part about this restaurant is its clean, bright and friendly. My personal favourite is the open kitchen where you can see your food being made. Will definitely return!"
