It is our regular dinner spot when our friends from NY and Montreal when we are all in town.Robert is just a sheer delight as he regales us with the menu selections of the evening. He provides amazing counsel on selections and pairings. The quality if the food is definitely ""farm-to-table"" caliber of freshness. The apples are always ah-mazing! Recommend to try the mushrooms, especially if they have chanterelles in season. Also recommend trying the foi-gras which sells out quickly. The menu will change given seasons but they do maintain staples like their incredible smoked and roasted free-range chicken. Their executive chef, Marie-France, always keeps the menu fresh and tasty.Incredibly friendly place and noisy as EVERYONE is just enjoying the food and company soooooo much. Highly, highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=TGRyNkLkNMFaj47NUDHjKA,Ronald L.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"One of the best brunch spots in Montreal (and I am fairly confident in saying that even though I'm an Australian living in NYC). Whatever you do, order the Mushroom party with a 63° egg and Zacharie Cloutier cheese! This dish will blow your mind and send your taste buds into overdrive. The lobster bisque was also up there (not as good as the mushroom, but it's certainly tough to beat), with a generous serving of lobster tail and complex bisque!The waiter was friendly and took his time going through each of the items on the menu in great detail! Has a great sense of humour too. Do not look elsewhere until you've tried this place!PS: The entire team is so friendly here at Chez Chose including the kitchen staff! Had to give them a personal thank you before I left! They may or may not tell you how they made the liquid crack that is the Mushroom dish."
/user_details?userid=2TslbDcx1bzvGjQYXhzwxQ,Monica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"My favorite meal in Montreal! We discovered this place a few years ago on a previous visit to Montreal. They have since moved from St Denis street to the quieter rue Bélanger. Same friendly owners, cute decor and amazing food! This is seasonal farm fresh fare at it's best. Portion size is perfect and I absolutely loved everything I tasted. The duck amuse Bouche was a great start, with nice smokey flavor on crispy baguette bread. For appetizers we tried the sweet potato soup which had a nice kick to it and the mushroom party which was a party in my mouth. It came with a perfectly cooked egg and melted cheese in a divine mushroom gravy. For my main I ordered the rabbit and it was juicy and tender, grilled to perfection. It was accompanied by seasonal veggies including tomatoes corn, carrots and beans on a bed of risotto. My husband had the vegetarian dish of sweet potato noodles topped with tofu, corn, peppers and broccoli. This dish was beautiful and had a bit of Asian flair.I wish I could have tried all their dishes because everything looked and sounded amazing. This is definitely a must if you are visiting Montreal."

The food was exquisite. My tastebuds were thoroughly satisfied by the amazing flavors and complexity of the meal. From the mushroom appetizer to the delectable strawberry dessert, every component was amazing, including the wine.I highly recommend this wonderful place for the richness in food and in the hosts"

/user_details?userid=g9-EtpCM1has0aVzuP0mlA,Alex K.,"Amherst, MA",5 star rating,"We found this place after another restaurant we wanted to go to was full... And so glad we did. The moment we walked in we were kept laughing by the gregarious maitre d'. We got help understanding the short menu in English. Service was leisurely but attentive and friendly. We enjoyed an excellent bottle of Rhone wine suggested by our server. An amuse bouche - a croquette of fried onions was a really delicious sign of what was to come. We had a spectacular appetizer called a ""mushroom party"" - wild mushrooms browned and then cooked in a cream wine sauce, with a soft egg and cheese on top. Next came a simple cream of carrot soup that was a nice break from the richness. We had duck confit (pretty nice, rich, good potatoes) and boudin noir (delicious, meaty, perfect texture). Dessert was a refreshing berry sorbet and chocolate and hazelnut pot de creme. We will definitely be returning next time we're in Montreal. It makes me so happy to find little local spots like this that put out better food than the famous overhyped spots."
/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Sunday brunch review: after hearing my boyfriend rant and rave about this place for a year I thought it about time to give it a try. We were lucky that it was a beautiful day and the restaurant was less than half full. The host (husband and wife couple) came running from the back of the restaurant to welcome my boyfriend back with hugs and kisses telling him that they missed him. Wow, I've never seen that happen anywhere in any restaurant I've ever been to.  I knew the service was going to be exceptional and it was.  Before leaving we were able to chat with the chef and praise the food. Oh yeah... Besides love and great service they can cook some pretty amazing food. I had the French Toast Monte Cristo. Holy shit, this was the most flavourful and savoury breakfast I've ever had. It's basically a grilled cheese with some pretty thick bread but stuffed with rabbit meat, garam masala, mustard... I thought I tasted some stewed raisins in there too but not sure. All topped with a sprinkle of maple syrup. Again... Best breakfast I've ever had!Do yourself a favour and order the foie gras as an entrée.  For $10 it's a steal. They sold me on the cocktail of the day which was a gin and tonic with rhubarb juice and a few drops of beet juice for colour. One of the best gin tonics I've ever had. My bf had the egg stew in tomato sauce with leek and chorizo. I had a bite, it was good, but I was happy to have taken the ""French toast.""The filter coffee is bland. Nothing special. They should switch to different beans. I'll definitely be back for supper. This is a gem in Montreal and for the quality/price it's also a steal."
/user_details?userid=e_jRFyF1nRRzP5h_5Nzziw,Ruth B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a hidden gem . We chose this place for 2 reasons 1) we wanted to support a female chef and 2) we were intrigued by the name. We thought if somebody can name their restaurant chez chose they must be alot of fun and have no pretention. Boy, we were right! This place is the perfect mix of mindblowing food with a laid back vibe. Its a family business . The parents run the front of the restaurant and their daughter is the chef. The dads laugh and energy is contagious which makes the service amazing. I believe the mother is the sommeliere and she's Lovely. You could tell that everybody in this place is a passionate. I went there during Montreal en lumieres and we had the tasting menu . The theme was Lyon this year so the menu was highly influenced by the region. I was blown away by the quality and quantity of food we were served.  In the same night  I was blessed with: brioche bread stuffed with a lyonnaise sausage, 3 style oysters, duck magret, rabbit, deer and for desert we were served a ""pogne"" which is a bread type desert from the  Lyon region. It was dirt cheap for the quality (55$) I will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=d3kEhf6hmEFmZsGmE-IXUg,Stephanie B.,"VT, VT",5 star rating,"Family run business -- fantastic local food with a french flair.  I came here once several years ago, on a Groupon no less and was surprised and delighted.  I have stopped with those coupons because it's usually a crappy deal but these guys really outdid themselves delivering excellent value, service and overall experience.The main thing that kept me going back was the ambiance.  It was VERY nondescript.  But unless you go to Toque or Maison Boulud, Montreal has a lot of little restaurants...  For the food, I think it's one of the best in Montreal.  Professional chef.  Food was really delicious, very flavorful, generous portions and very good value.  I see that it's classified under comfort food.  But it was actually quite refined."
/user_details?userid=wdTjptLy4l1WJD75kUxeew,Mindy C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went there for Valentine's Day and definitely had a lovely experience! Although the restaurant is located in a sketchy place for fine french cuisine, the staff is super welcoming and available for advices. For french cuisine beginners, it's a bit hard to figure out what's on the menu because they use lots and lots of fancy ingredients that I can barely remember. But that makes the experience more fun if you want to try new things. Chez Chose is great for romantic dates and if you get the chance to have a dessert, I'd definitely recommend to try the Chocolate cream Jar with caramelized avelines and chantilly... it's like having a mouthful of ferrero chocolate, perfect match of not-too-sweet nutty taste."
/user_details?userid=vueW1L-66j0oKA_GjUHBvw,Gian C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5 star rating,"On a trip to visit friends in Montreal, I found this little place as I was walking home. It was absolutely amazing! Fresh, locally sourced ingredients, hand picked by the chef! Fantastic French comfort food (one of my favorite cuisines)! The staff was wonderful, providing me with so much care and attention. They helped us pick some fantastic wines to accompany our entrees, and made sure we were more than pleased with our meal. I can't wait to visit Montreal again and return to this lovely neighborhood restaurant!"

/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't know why i don't give it a 5 star, it's probably one of my top 5 restaurants in montreal! I think it's probably because i keep coming back and my wallet bleeds each time when i take more wine when i supposed to be in this happy & lay-back environment with friends! My takes from a few experience here 1) deer steak is no longer the best in town - some new  restaurants start to catch up.  2) The seafood/fish dish surprised me by how good it is (believe me, i'm a seafood snob who don't normally trust quebecois on this :P)   3)anything with mushroom is excellent and almost addictive!  4) the friendly owner makes you wanna drink well and drink a lot- hence, my wallet situation..."
/user_details?userid=rA6CmnlEKsuy614pnibhbw,Sa R.,"Ajax, Canada",5 star rating,Incredible restaurant. A little out of the way and the neighborhood looks sketchy but the most welcoming couple own the restaurant and they'll spend half an hour explaining the menue to you in detail.  We LOOOVED this place

/user_details?userid=Hex5KcfgYveCuPQeF99M3w,Amy F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Food was good but not great.  Over salted and portions out of balance for a tasting menu.  I wanted to really like this place but I won't be back, with all the phenomenal options in Montreal.  The service was really spotty, and our server basically told us what we wanted instead of having a conversation, which ended up with my friend ending up with a bottle of wine she didn't choose, and a charge for her to have the last glass paired with our meal (we both paid for the pairing), all because we told him she didn't like red wines."
