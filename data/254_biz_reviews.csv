The uni & bone marrow noodles, and the duck confit noodles were heavy, decadent, rich, and amazing. The octopus carpaccio was also incredibly delicious. By far the best meal I had in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"4 on 5 for Otto bistro Japonais. This was a last minute pick on our way to a concert. The menu has a good deal of variety with some classic favorites with a twist. We tried the fried tofu which was the most memorable disH of the night. The tofu was homemade and honestly we will be back for that fish. The octuors carpaccio was fresh and well seasoned. The Ramen was good and the duck mazemen is highly recommended . The drinks is a must, we had a tequila and Yuzu cocktail. If your out and about, worth chilli here and nice place for a date."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bistro Otto has been on my list fir a while and last weekend I finally went w a group of friends for dinnerIt was a lot smaller than I imagined, from seeing the pictures online. But that's a good thing. It had an intimate feel but not too small that would make you feel like you cannot move around comfortably.The staff greeted us warmly, they were friendly and helpful. The kitchen is opened so you can see the all action. We took a bottle of wine to start and then proceeded to ordering the sashimi, octopus carpaccio, aubergine, chicken karaage and a duck ramen to share. He sashimi was so fresh and yummy. The octopus was perfectly seasoned with a kick of hot chili. The chicken karaage was crispy and juicy without a thick batter. The duck ramen was hearty. And the aubergine? It was so good we ordered another plate! I definitely recommend this restaurant and I'd love to come back to try other things.P.S: the lighting was terrible for food pics, i apologize for the neon purple hue"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I'd randomly spotted Otto Bistro a few weeks ago while walking along Mont Royal and made a mental note to check it out. Their sister restaurant, Otto Yakitori Izakaya, is fantastic so I was hoping for the same level at Bistro Otto. They specialize in larger plates.We dropped in on a Wednesday evening (around 7:00pm) and it was empty. The inside is beautifully decorated and quaint with a mix of tables, high tables and bar seats. There's about 32 seats.There was a special and regular/drink menu. The main menu is split into soups, salads, appetizers, main plates and desserts.- Kalso salad ($8.00) - 5 types of seaweed, thin sliced cabbage, sea bacon and ponzu. Beautiful presentation and interesting mix of textures. The cabbage was great. - Arctic char tartare ($16.00) - scallions, shallots, leaves, beated poached egg and beet chips. This seemed more like poke than a tartare to me but the arctic char was fresh and well balanced. It had a great citrusy sauce. The ""leaves"" on top tasted similar to alfalfa sprouts.  - Spicy ikuramen ($20.00) - salmon roe, spicy ramen noodles, tofu, coriander, fried shallots, sansho peppers and sesame. Way overpriced for a bowl of ramen but the noodles had a pleasant bite and the spice level was absolutely perfect. We didn't realize it was a soupless ramen but that made it easier to share. However, the bowl was missing something. It didn't have enough substance to it. The salmon roe won't fill you up.Good quality but a bit too steep for my blood. Can't justify paying $20.00 for ramen ($24.00 for their most popular uni mazesoba dish)! 3.5 stars."

Yet, I had very high hopes for this place, I was excited to try real authentic Japanese food. I've had ramen noodles with a duck leg and it was just okay. To be honest, I found their variety pretty limited and prices quite high for the portions they offer. That being said, it's a solid 3 stars and could be a good choice if you give it another chance."

Tasted today , so so and food so slow , waiter so lost , I mean they r nice persons , all very kind , but just don't really pay attention to client's need , I have to raise my hand for maybe 5 mins or 5 times then they realize me when it's not too busy.  Spend 400 for 5 person and I just eat a little maybe we drink more . Sry been lazy to took pics but the dessert ,"

The combination of uni and bone marrow with ramen noodle was perfect; they melted in my mouth. Their kaisendon was so fresh as well!

This place is still new to the city, but their original location Otto Yakitori in down town has been around more than 3 years and still going gung ho! Otto in Plateau has great menu, my favourites are Lamb curry rice, shoyu Ramen, and Uni nigiri. Very friendly staff. Owners Henry and Hitoshi is a great team. I really enjoy this restaurant. Food is just delicious and filling.I am a new fan!"

/user_details?userid=5ArEzMYU4onO6DZ9ppkKSg,Zachary D.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my local favourites in the Mount Royal area, a beautiful little restaurant highlighting delicious food and a friendly atmosphere. I've gone on two occasions and left completely satisfied both times, first was for the lamb shank curry which was to die for, succulent, perfectly braised lamb right on the bone with a delicious curry. The second time I went was even better! I got the Uni and bone marrow Mazemen which is a like a brothless ramen, the bone marrow melted off the bone and when you mixed in all the ingredients into the succulent noodles it's was a savoury delight, accompanied with some warm sake and I was in heaven. Finish with a great matcha fondant cake, fluffy on the outside and gooey on the inside, all you could ever want. All in all, great food, great people and a lovely time, I thank all of the staff at Otto"
/user_details?userid=pmnJnoPVkJ0M_8wRiDuk-A,Wendy W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"seaweed salad was excellent! The lamb shank curry was delicious, but a tad bit salty, and duck noodles were Amazing! My only complaint is the food was not hot enough, the food got cold half way through the meal (and no I did not waste time posting about my food) Taste wise it was fantastic."
/user_details?userid=O0PGfIbPGvbsZ0XpWFbMqg,Zoe S.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,"This place was awesome! My friend and I were looking for a place to eat dinner and saw someone eating the steak as we walked by. It looked so good, my friend insisted we try the place out. It was not a disappointment. The server was friendly and patient. We got the steak and noodle entrees. The dishes were a decent portion and just satisfied us. For the price of the dishes, they could have given a little more. But it was delish! Definitely would recommend."
/user_details?userid=i18oz-2TnGrOJewfisie4g,Kat C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Went there for supper with a friend, and the food was quite good. However, one of the waiters, who also seemed to be manager, was openly very rude with one waitress. He seemed drunk,kept yelling at her, swearing, and it all became awkward very quickly for the clients."
