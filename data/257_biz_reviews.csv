/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Mano Cornuto's is a simple and unpretentious coffee shop that keeps local Griffintown residents well fed and watered from dawn until dusk, offering coffee, light lunches, pastries, wines and fun low-ABV cocktails - bringing you Italian culture you must taste!The décor is bright, modern yet warm and cozy, with strong vintage notes and atmosphere that makes you want to stay and chat or read for hours, one might say it has a truly authentic feel to it. In fact, drawing a shared deep passion for Italian culture, Mano Cornuto is the culmination of a 5-year dream in the making bringing together the passion of four fabulous partners with strong experience and expertise: Chef James Baran, Vito Ciocca, both veterans of Chuck Hughes restaurant group Le Bremner and Garde Manger, Tyler Maher, and Alex Argoussis. The owners have also recruited sommelier Rob Clarke (Foxy and Beau Mont) to build their wine program.The coffee here is first rate, with the right balance of flavour without the bitterness and is made with a special blend of beans from local specialty coffee roaster and retailer Traffic Coffee Club. I tried a macchiato - it's an espresso with tad bit of steamy hot milk and served in the same little cup that an espresso comes in - some say it's like an espresso married a cappuccino and had a slightly foamy child. The menu is simple and brief, using fresh ingredients and the most classic recipes, you can choose from choices of homemade foccacia with spread of your choice, frittata, bright salads, tuscan flat bread sandwiches called schiacciata, a variety small side dishes, italian charcuterie & cheeses, but also an assortment of small cakes and pastries, known as pasticcini, are served as a dessert, as a treat to accompany coffee.During lunch, with some close friends we tried:Insalata: Fresh Birri heirloom tomato, onion, cucumbers, giant croutons, and greens.  Schiacciata: A crunchy, yet soft and Italian flatbread from Tuscany, where it has been eaten since the 15th century, is brushed with the finest virgin olive oil and means ""pressed"" or ""flattened"" in Italian. Biting into one these giant-sized sandwiches, was very satisfying and simply heavenly! And very reasonably priced considering the quality. The meat version came with melt in your mouth mortadella with pistachios and prosciutto. And the vegetarian version came with heirloom tomatoes and soft creamy stracchino cheese. Cannoli: Tube-shaped pastry shells of fried pastry dough fill with light creamy ricotta-based filling, no binger than a finger, originally from Sicily.  Bomboloni: Irresistibly light and delicious Italian doughnut, coated with sugar, stuffed with an orange flavoured pastry cream.  When asked for the meaning of Mano Cornuto, there seems to be many reasons but the best seems to be a hand sign to ward off the evil eye (which is known in Southern Italy as malocchio) to signify the warding off of bad luck!If you're like me, do come early in the morning to smell the freshly baked schiacciata coming out of the oven, enjoy a coffee, and then come back for lunch (and soon dinner) to enjoy clean Italian food like when were kids - all at a reasonable and accessible prices."
/user_details?userid=Q6f-wmLKk6kPIq648ybmbw,Shiran B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Are you looking for that cafe vibe type of restaurant that is beyond chill yet amazingly put together? This place is for you. The perfect size with just the right amount of seats. The kitchen is literally infront of the restaurant so if you sit at the bar (which you totaly should) you get the perfect view from any side you choose from!.. Also if VITO Is working you definitely better sit by the bar because you will have the best time of your life. Full of life and passion towards his menu and drinks! Oh God..  he knows it all! Also fun fact! He is one of the owners. Its such a laid back restaurant , you feel like you're a local in Italy basically. What I actually LOVE about this place that everything is imported from Italy.. now I totaly love when restaurants support local but HELLO can we be real here? You go to an Italian restaurant to eat Quebec cheese? I dont think so! So literally everything including the wines are all imported! They make the pasta in house which is like such a win. Very small menu but I respect that! They focus and perfect each dish. Um the focaccia is ridiculous!!! I think we had like 3 PC.. nope, we definitely did! Dessert menu? ONE ITEM and that's how it should be. This place is just pure genius and puts alot of ""Italian restaurants"" with big names out there in their little pocket. In my opinion. They have a breakfast brunch menu as well and I cant wait to come back! Glad this place is here to stay"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There are places that are just cool. They are not trying to be per se but somehow they just feel cool. They have a certain feel and a vibe that you can't quite place but you feel it when you are there. Mano Cornuto is one such place. Its location - on the first floor on a condo complex on a side street in Griffintown - certainly doesn't give that vibe but once inside, you feel it.Mano Cornuto evokes a old style neighbourhood Italian café - the marble-like tabletops, the old Italian signs as artwork, the wooden chairs, the long bar, the mirrored glass behind the bar - but then you have the mix of rap and R&B playing over the sound system. Food and drink-wise, it's designed to be a casual lunch and dinner option with a variety of sandwiches, salads, fresh pastas as well as coffee, natural wine and cocktails. Since its opening, I have been a few times and have been able to try a bunch of items.In classic Italian fashion, the dishes feel simple in concept but still very precise in execution. The focaccia with ricotta and truffle honey is a perfect example of that. So simple but so so good. The light and airy focaccia. The creamy and rich ricotta. The rich mix of truffle oil and honey. I could eat this every day and never get sick of it.Their version of a Stromboli - spicy sausage, pecorino, rapini, white anchovies served over bread - was another good example of this simple but well executed and flavourful approach. Anchovies may not be for everyone but it worked so well with the rest of the ingredients. When my wife came with me, she had the Schiacchiata vege - stracchino, rapini, arugula and bomba sauce between fresh focaccia. A light sandwich but very flavourful. The key is all of the sandwiches is the excellent focaccia. It provides a great base to serve different combinations over it.Getting away from the sandwich options, I tried the arancini spaghetti carbonara. Just amazing - great crisp on the exterior of the spaghetti ball. The flavour is full-on carbonara - rich and creamy with the pancetta bringing some saltiness. A beautiful dish in both presentation and execution.Finally, for dessert, there are also homemade campobasso doughnuts of different flavours. I went with the nutella version. Great chew to the doughnut with the Nutella filling bringing the rich chocolate hazelnut flavour. An excellent doughnut.Mano Cornuto is a great spot - whether for lunch, dinner or happy hour. It is the kind of neighbourhood spot you would want around your home - great food, reasonable cost, good drinks and cocktails and a great vibe and atmosphere to enjoy. It is not quite right by my place but it is close enough that I will continue to make the effort to visit more frequently. Worth being where the cool kids are ;)Cheers!"

Something about this little spot made me reminisce my trip to Italy. The way it's set up and the owners give this place a warm and welcoming Italian-like feeling. I felt like I was in Italy.  The little pizza slices are just excellent! They are not on the menu. The customer service was great except one situation where one of their staff  members was arguing with me about something that he did and I was not happy with his actions. We were a group of 4 and 2 of us got there first so we got 4 seats at the bar. This guy (different person) gave 2 of our seats to the other guests. And pushed us to the corner and in tight space by adding two more chairs. Seems rather unfair for him to do that given that we already had those seats. And when I spoke to him about that, he started to argue with me and could not understand why it was a problem. This one incident showed problems in their staff communications (like that guy was not aware and didn't check if those seats were available before seating those guests there) and then attitude problems (the way he spoke with me). This encounter tainted my entire experience unfortunately."

From incredible coffee and pastries to their lunch offerings of pasta, crudo, sandwiches and fresh focaccia, this place does not disappoint! Their natural wines are amazing as well!"
