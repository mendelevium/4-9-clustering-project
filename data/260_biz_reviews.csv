/user_details?userid=P0eTj4azE3vaMkI4mmDFrw,Curt T.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Amazing dumplings. Best I've ever had....my only problem now is going to find a place in San Diego that can compare. We got the shumai which is pork and mushroom. I don't care for mushrooms but this was simply delicious. Also got the shrimp dumplings which were just as good. The best part of the meal was the porc et crab good thing they had instructions on how to eat them...the soup inside was AMAZING.  And then to add the chili paste/sauce to it after is the bestHighly recommend this place along with the porc et crab...
/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",4 star rating,"Four of us Out-of-Towners found ourselves looking for a place for lunch in the Chinatown area on a recent Thursday afternoon.  The two highest rated nearby places were way too full, so we took a chance on this place and it was quite good!  Nothing fancy.  Short menu of mostly soup dumplings.  We shared the Pork Cilantro ones (which came out first), along with the Cucumber Salad, followed by the Pork w/Cabbage.  Honestly I couldn't tell much difference between the two pork ones, but would say the Cilantro one edged the other out slightly.  I ordered tea and was brought a pot with four cups.  Not sure what kind of tea it was (oolong perhaps?) but it was quite good.  The only slight disappointment was the cucumber salad which was just a bit too simple.  Could have used some extra seasoning.Note:  they don't bring the tab...you go up to the register to pay...wouldn't have known if I hadn't asked after coming back from the restroom.Note 2:  CASH only"
/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"This place is exactly average, minus a star, and here's why: their menu is almost exclusively XLB, so one would expect that they do this one thing well. Right off the bat, it's very clear that the wrapper is way too thick - almost bao-like. It is also quite sticky, so it makes picking it up without breaking it a bit tricky. However, the filling inside is pretty good. All in all: just OK. I have no desire to return, I'm certain I can find better XLB elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=_YyQF6B2vJqYf1FnCyXv9A,Emile L.,"Edgewater, NJ",3 star rating,We tried the classic pork dumplings as well as the shrimp and pork dumplings. Both lacked flavor and seasoning. The dough was also too thick. The service was quick and friendly.
/user_details?userid=Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",4 star rating,"I'm so full of soup dumplings. This sister restaurant to Mai Xiang Yuan (right next door....same ownership)...specializes in soup dumplings. If you want to get your slurp on, this is where to do it. If you're not slurping, you're doing it wrong. Don't be afraid of the slurp.There are several varieties to choose from: pork, beef lamb, pork with seafood...and variations in these choices. We had the traditional pork and tried the pork with cilantro.Both were awesome. The size of each (hand made) soup dumpling is perfect. So is the thickness of the skin...not too thick and not too thin. They arrive piping hot and face-blister worthy. Each delectable dumpling has just the right amount of soup.....to slurp.If you don't have cash, go next door and get some because they don't take cards."

Much more intimate than other dumpling restaurants I've tried. You are able to have a conversation as the tables aren't so close together. O V E R A L L   Q U A L I T YThese dumplings were good. The dough was a little bit stickier than other restaurants, but they were PACKED with flavor. We had the sweet pork dumplings and they are SWEET. Almost like a dessert. C O S T$About 10-16$ for dumplings but you only get 10. Slightly disappointed that I couldn't get a little bit more. W A I T   T I M E SWe arrived at early supper time and there was no wait time. From order to table dumplings took about 15 minutes.  P A R K I N G  &  L O C A T I O NIn China Town, parking is limited but not terrible. Mostly will have to pay for parking a spot and walk a little bit."
/user_details?userid=5XNwv2vKuAKFyj1nBUaPOg,Jason A.,"Nepean, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,Very tasty xiao long bao found in old school Montreal Chinatown. Service was super nice and food arrived very quickly. Our favourite was the pork and leak dumplings with its sweet soup and great flavour. Only downside was that the bottoms of the dumplings had a tendency to stick to the steamer causing them to break with soup leaking out.
/user_details?userid=T2yEDkQOC2DMNdO5BNPg5Q,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,Delicious soup dumplings and siu mui. We ordered the pork and cabbage and shrimp and pork dumplings. Meat and seafood tasted fresh and the skin of the dumplings were decently doughy. The staff was super friendly. They only accept cash.
/user_details?userid=whCIT8n-O3EKWv_nIjl46w,Suzi P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Really amazing dumplings. The place was empty which concerned us, but those concerns were eliminated when our dishes arrived. We ordered the pork classic soup dumpling along with the beef and cilantro soup dumpling. 10 pieces each and we were stuffed. We also ordered the har gow shrimp but we weren't fans, maybe because they are known for their soup dumplings and you can't compare.We will definitely be back again."
/user_details?userid=pRndtV9sWaEWSA4xjFcLTw,Pauline C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3 star rating,"Okay xiao long bao...kinda on the bland side, I'm used to vinegar w sliced ginger but not available here. Some of them tasted a little doughy, and one stuck to the silicone mat and broke. We didn't try anything else."
/user_details?userid=0goB-Irbm8GGFsPcobs39Q,Olivia S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"An decent little restaurant in Chinatown that serves xiao long bao made fresh as you order. Reminds me a lot of Sammi soup dumpling on Ste-Catherine with similar menu items. Food was good, service was decent, but the ambiance was lacking though. My boyfriend and I sat in silence in the near-empty restaurant when we went around 2pm. No music, no radio, no chatter. Complete and awkward silence lol. I would return if I had a craving of soup dumplings and was in Chinatown and didn't care for an ambiance. Overall recommend if you need a fix of XLB but not as much for a cozy gathering."
/user_details?userid=PipGc4TdxurGizJ6CKmU7Q,Daniel B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4 star rating,"Yes, this spot may be on the same block as a much more heralded dumpling shop. But don't let that stop you from taking in these delightful little soup dumplings. Especially if you prefer your dumplings to be steamed and filled with a little broth in addition to meat.My kids are soup dumpling fanatics, and these were their favorite XLB of the trip. The one pro tip I have to offer is that if you can't decide on which dumplings to order, the kitchen will gladly split a batch into two different flavors. It's great to know if you aren't there with a big group of people and prefer to try as many things as possible. Really, what I wanted to do was spend a few hours just having a progressive tour of Chinese treats, hopping from one great restaurant to another. Unfortunately, my family isn't into that kind of eating adventure.My wife also isn't into me taking pictures of food at the table, so apologies for my lack of photographic evidence."

/user_details?userid=m_1e9w9JYl35t5OGkuv15A,Nick W.,"Hudson, NH",5 star rating,"We swung in Bien Maison for an early lunch.  We didn't have a large quantity of food, just an order of steamed shrimp dumplings and an order of the classical pork soup dumplings.   Both were great... I'm still thinking about how good the soup dumplings were - I've never had anything like them before.   We'd go back and load up on more of a variety of the soup dumplings next time we are in Montreal.   Super good and very reasonably priced we thought."
/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"Descent xiao long baos,it took a while to get the food(20 minutes). The prices is a little bit higher than it's competitors, the quality a little bit worst. there is just something lacking with the montreal dumpling scene, it just doesn't make me crave for it like toronto does.Service was pretty good, as the girl was attentive and efficient. i would recommend going here if you are really craving for some soup dumpling, only if you are around the neighborhood."
/user_details?userid=BCp4aBWrDd5pMTynN1S9Og,Arnold T.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Had their specialty - the pork and crab dumplings which they make fresh. It came in 10 pieces for  $11.99 or 12.99 (can't remember because we ate their yesterday and they didn't have WiFi even though they have the password posted on their wall). Despite not having WiFi, the food was good. The soup inside the dumpling was so tasty. It took a while to get this out but definitely worth it. We also ordered the sui mai and the shrimp dumpling which didn't disappoint."

/user_details?userid=yZMq9VAVL9CXtJ46YY9g_A,Lauren D.,"Kissimmee, FL",5 star rating,"Bien Maison was great! I went in October 2019. I used to live in Taiwan and frequently enjoyed xiao long bao but currently live in a city where no xiao long bao can be found. I was so excited to find a restaurant near my hotel that served soup dumplings. I had some difficulty getting to the restaurant due to them being closed a few days I was there, but once I finally went it was worth it! I only wish I had been able to go more than once. Service was pleasant, food was delicious, prices were great. I just wish I had a restaurant like this where I live!"
/user_details?userid=jRVnoYLOiS2LOSowkWVizw,Elysabeth R.,"South Strafford, VT",5 star rating,"SO happy to happen upon this place!  Having lived in Shanghai-- and in Montreal for a half-marathon with the kids-- we were all delighted to find our way to a place (in the heart of Montreal's Chinatown) with really authentic ""xiao long bao,"" a family favorite (also known as ""soup dumplings"").  One daughter ordered the ""sweet pork/porc sucre"" and found those most similar to ones we'd enjoyed in our local Shanghaiese dumpling shop.  One daughter decided to try ""lamb with pepper"" for a new taste; she was undecided.  My son, as usual, ate everything and enjoyed it all.The shu mai (pork and mushroom dumplings, steamed) with noodles deal for $8 can't be beat, and it's great fun to watch everything being made by hand in the back.For an authentic meal at reasonable prices and a charming waitress, you should definitely give this ""good house"" a try!"

/user_details?userid=w8MFny2c_sOngPLSlY9yzw,Rich S.,"Long Island City, NY",4 star rating,"Doesn't compare with the chain, Din Tai Fung, but for Montreal it's not bad. The skin was a bit thick and a bit soggy but otherwise good. The place wasn't very crowded and was a bit ""run down"" but who cares when get decent soup dumplings."
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been looking for soup dumpling places in Chinatown Montreal for the longest time, and finally found one! Their soup dumplings are great, and I also enjoy their woodear mushroom salad.Their service time is a bit long; the 3 out of 4 times I went, it took nearly 40 minutes to get our dumplings. One time, the waitress forgot a friend's order and we had to wait some more."
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very nice xiaolongbao in the middle of Chinatown. I also ordered a cucumber salad as a side dish. The service is a bit slow, but it might be due to the fact that it's not frozen."
/user_details?userid=QFSek24a9vAOy1VQpvZhYw,Kevin Z.,"Calgary, Canada",3 star rating,"Bien Maison is in the same family as Mai Xiang Yuan, which by far has the best (boiled) dumplings in the city. However, the soup dumplings at Bien Maison fell short of the standard set by Sammi & Soup. The seafood ones I ordered rang in at a solid $13, and were premade. As a result, many of the skins of the dumplings broke and the soup leaked out of them. The sweet pork ones were made fresh, which was a little better - the soup stayed largely intact. These rang in at $10. The cucumber appetizer was also lack luster compared to that of Sammi & Soup, for $1 more than it's competitor - lose lose. Overall, this was still an acceptable soup dumpling experience. However, for lunch, Sammi & Soup prices are much more reasonable, starting at $7 and averaging $9 for a basket of 10 dumplings, which very few broken skins. Oh, and they don't take anything but cash here - it's 2018 for Christ's sake. While I still think their parent company Mai Xiang Yuan is the undefeated champion for boiled dumplings, this experience was lackluster and definitively leaves Sammi & Soup and the standout in the soup dumpling scene."

/user_details?userid=Y6HB-uUIK87IxFzHcleHzQ,Noel M.,"Elk Grove, CA",4 star rating,Very nice place and easy to get too in Montreal. We ordered two entrees of dumplings. They come in quantities of 15 so for two persons you can get two and be full. They were plump but slippery. Maybe get the crustier dumplings instead of the steamed. But they were nice and enjoyable.
/user_details?userid=uvvnJg0MS81bPIfhNCUWEQ,Pamela R.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Awesome place! We were a party of three, so we ordered enough dumplings to each have 10 (3 orders total), which was just enough to satisfy us. We had the classic pork, pork with cabbage, and lamb with cilantro--this latter one particularly blew us away, but all three were fantastic and well worth the 20-min wait time! Would definitely recommend, along with the chocolate dumplings to wrap up the meal!"

/user_details?userid=rwMtmPP_oK2emrkQboJY_Q,Ricky C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We went during Otakuthon on a Saturday. First and foremost, we placed our order at 7:30pm, the food came at 8:30pm. The owner of the restaurant gave a measly cold appetizer that was absolutely unappealing as complimentary. The food quality is good, however service was horrible. I suggested for future occasions they hire more staff for better efficiency and to give us a discount for the long wait, and I asked politely, turns out the owner just brushed my comments off plus gave me the nasty attitude. My verdict, Sammi Dumplings has better quality Xiao Long Bao, good service orientated and friendly. I highly do not recommend going to Bien Maison, you go at your own risk."
