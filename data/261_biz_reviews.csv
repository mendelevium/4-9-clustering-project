/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have grabbed takeout service a few times during the COVID-19 shut down, so this shorter-than-average review is based on those experiences. First, I want to thank the owners and staff of Le Cartet for remaining open for the community during some tough times, I really appreciate your being there for us! Second, the sandwiches are super fresh and delicious.  Today I had a simple ham and cheese on baguette. I say simple because of the ingredient list, but wow what a great sandwich! The ham was thick and irregularly cut and had a nice sweet and clovey taste, yum. The bread was of course fantastic and had a thick smear of Dijon butter with some fresh lettuce and tasty cheese. Simple, but oh so good!  I am looking forward to trying the sit-down brunch service when things settle down!"

Until then, will be going elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=i8q-S7WFNkfgOVBx7K6tPw,Yao W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Cartet has been on my list for quite some time, but to be frank, I must say it sadly didn't live up to the expectations! The served brunch dishes were lacking flavour and portions were small for the price. Their signature ice coffee was blend and way too much ice! However, service was quick and friendly, staff wore masks all time. 3.5 rounding it up to 4, to take into account current situation."

We ordered the brunch plates Cantons and Nordique. I specifically  remembered I snagged the last maple croissant.  The food was tasty and substantial because we walked to the botanitcal garden afterwards.We waited for 10-15 minutes. But, its worth it.bathroom clean. CC accepted.Our waiter was very nice. I felt bad for him since he had the outside area."
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Have to say I'm a little disappointed. Had heard so much hype about this place, but the flavours were just not there. Tried the toscan poached eggs (sauce bland , potatoes cold )and the lac brome eggs Benedict (sauce was great, duck was yummy, eggs were over cooked )Décor is cute, service is great. But for the price, Montreal has many other places that will WOW you more ."
/user_details?userid=aDQggFDt8M6mF2Ysn1_JGA,Sharon S.,"Pickering, Canada",5 star rating,"A must try if you are in Montreal! A cute charming little restaurant with some fantastic dishes. We had the Nordique and the Jalapeno. With the signature dishes you can add on a mimosa, and its come to about $28.00 - well worth it!I highly recommend the Jalapeno, a great mexican breakfast. The scrambled eggs were some of the best we have ever tried. The service was very friendly, quick and attentive."

The first time I got the Toscan which was superb. The second time I ordered Lac Brome which is Le Cartet's spin on egg Benedict. I order a vanilla latte too and it was exceptional. Five stars for Le Cartet all the way!
/user_details?userid=gdYxaKBzD_GxLY9sAnHVdg,Holly R.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this little spot: I have loved it for years and the quality has never wavered. I visited recently while in Montreal for a Birthday weekend, and made this stop for a special Birthday brunch - it didn't disappoint. I had an amazing meal with poached eggs and avocado, topped off with the best yogurt I have ever had in my life, fresh orange juice, and of course, coffee. I can not describe how good this food is - just go. It's a little on the pricey side, but totally worth it as a social treat. SO. GOOD!"
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",4 star rating,"Between all the searching and places coming up CLOSED for the day- and set to reopen between 5-5:30pm, Cartet was the lone survivor. I honestly didn't want anything too filling and liked Cartet's Brunch menu right away with Salads, Waffles, Croissants and such.As we were told, Cartet has changed with the times- and for the better. Place is very comfortable and cute. See it as a long space with steps leading up inside, seating along the whitewashed brick wall and middle aisle- and kitchen/prep stations to the right. Let me not forget their gourmet shop as you enter if you want to stock up on their dry Pastas, Oils, Jams, Teas (Kusmi) and Chocolates....the list goes on and on.Cartet brings in a really nice eye to simple style. This ultra trendy- yet friendly, low-key spot is almost like a full-service type shop. Both of our Brunch items and Aperol Spritz were good. Service was pleasant and price was on point. Cartet earns its place here for a cool atmosphere without it being stuffy at all. And if you want to mix with the locals- this is the place to come."
/user_details?userid=jtx0pnIDrn5f1EGMQ9jjDQ,Penelope M.,"Fanwood, NJ",4 star rating,"Brunchers would love this place.  Modern, but casual and definitely inviting.  There was a small section inside the restaurant where specialty products were sold.  We were seated almost immediately and while waiting,  I've seen locals walked in, to grab ready made meals from their open fridge as ""takeout"".   It took a while for our food to arrive that I had time to peruse their little store, twice.  Good looking maple syrups,  sardines, bottled tuna, canned foie gras, chocolates and shortbread cookies (La Mere Poulard!- my new addiction), were all on display. I bought stuff as souvenirs here, for myself, lol.Then my 'Jalapeño'  came. Star of our meal, I should say: festive and flavorful! The chorizo,  the red bell pepper, avocado and cheese got along so well with the scrambled egg.  It also came with salad and sour cream(?) sauce with the perfect blend of smoky sauce. This is what to get here, I think. If only I could drink,  tsk, their mimosas were so inviting."
/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,Came here for their breakfast. Saw good reviews about them and thought of checking it out. The waiter when taking my order was rushing. I understand that their menu was changing to the lunch one and I felt she should have not done that.So I ordered the eggs scrambled with goat cheese. After eating half of the meal I found a hair to be on my food. I told the waitress and she said they will make a new one. The mistake was in their side and I would have appreciated if they gave like 50% off or some other dish as a complimentary. Nothing was provided and I felt disappointed on them.The food was good. I came here for their eggs and it was really good. The side of salad was one of the tastiest salads I ever tried. Maybe they need to focus on quality control and if a mistake occurs to properly handle it.
/user_details?userid=ul2N2IiGEenztm5GTMdsmQ,Lauren H.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,We split the jalapeño with a side of the smoked salmon and it was one of the best breakfasts we've had in Montreal. The flavors were on point.
/user_details?userid=gLSQCEhGy7-uRnNbNnVykg,Andrew D.,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,"Meh. That's all I have to say about this spot. Came here on Saturday, it was a full house, and thus there was a bit of a wait to get seated. Once we were seated and ordered, the food took about 30-40 mins to come out, possibly longer. The food tasted good but was nothing out of the ordinary. May be a good spot during the week but I'd avoid on weekends."
/user_details?userid=LYOvyedhKD3eqs4dJrp6yQ,Jackie S.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"Excellent brunch, just a tad bit pricey. They have a lot of breakfast/brunch/lunch options, and all their brunches come with a mimosa which explains why the price is high. I don't like mimosas but they wouldn't let me swap for a bloody. I ended up ordering a separate drink.The service is good and the food is excellent, with some hefty portions. I had the brunch Cartet and it had a little bit of everything, a croissant ham sandwich, scrambled eggs, fruit, and salad. Their benedict is great as well.Gluten free folks...they have GF bread! Inside is super sleek and modern, with a take-away stand for coffee and pastries, but if it's nice, sit outside!"
/user_details?userid=LfVN5rI3rBTCaWM7OG_ohQ,Charlotte Q.,"Stroudsburg, PA",5 star rating,"Delicious and the portion is very big. In the pic, the top dish has really nice salad with fresh vinegar taste. Salmon on top of black bread with blue cheese in between. The bottom dish is a must for people who is very hungry. Bacon is high quality.One of my favorite brunch places."
/user_details?userid=yFa3di94lpmRl0xjfpwtSA,Stephanie M.,"Hackensack, NJ",5 star rating,"I loved the atmosphere , the people here are very welcoming and sweet. I had the Le Santé and white chocolate chaud. Let me just tell you.  Never in my life have I been a fan of white chocolate. I decided to give the white chocolate chaud a try and I'm honestly glad I did because it changed the hot chocolate game for me it was so delicious! I have also never had poached eggs with goat cheese and multigrain bread combination it was perfect , and you know me can't forget my yogurt and granola!"
/user_details?userid=FPv27CkYLodbfz3gj5Fnkg,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I came here for breakfast on a recommendation that this was the best brunch spot. The service is a bit slow but I'm beginning to think that's just a Canadian thing. I mean, no one moves at a New York pace after all. At first glance of the menu, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge breakfast food fan as I feel like all eggs are pretty much the same. And why even bother with oatmeal or ""bowls"" of any sort. The scramble eggs and smoked jalapenos caught my eye as something different. I skipped the coffee and went straight for a glass of white wine. Who cares it's only 9am?Omg. These scrambled eggs were epic. They actually had flavor and were just a bit runny like they should be. Not overcooked at all. I went down for a bite and never came back up for air. Amazing."
/user_details?userid=4Dnux2HU1O3oJaI_LpdzVg,Pamela P.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"If you're walking around Old Montreal, this is an adorable breakfast stop! Our eggs and coffee were delicious, as well as the brioche french toast (highly recommend solely for the apple jam on top). Definitely one of the best breakfast options in the area!"
/user_details?userid=4ayVX0YKY3GSP2IICpLJXQ,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best meals I had in Montreal. We came a prime brunch time and did not have to wait long but were treated to complimentary banana bread and orange juice to start and I ordered the brunch sante. It came with delicious granola and yogurt, fresh fruit, poached eggs ontop of toast and a few slices of cheese and figs. I loved the fact that there were so many things to eat just on one plate! My tastebuds never got bored and I truly enjoyed every component of this meal. My brother got the brunch de l'atlantique with salmon and cream cheese on a bagel and another assortment of tasty foods. He added some sausage for some extra protein. My mom got the brunch cartet which was similar to the l'atlantique but with a eggs and ham croissant instead.Overall, I LOVED the amount of variety in each plate of food here. It was all fresh and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was also light and overall a feel good place."
/user_details?userid=raqTx1Tj-wTMs25mcDPMxQ,Monica M.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Loved loved loved this brunch place! Its very big so there was no long lineup even on a Saturday morning. Took coffee & mimosa to start. I had better coffee... Then avocado toast with an extra side of potatoes. This is a great choice for vegetarians or vegans or simply for people who love avocado toast! My eating partner took a great egg (benedict) plate. Was happy with his eggs but mentioned that some potatoes were undercooked. Service is fast. Very satisfied with this place. Enjoy!

Added the smoked salmon to my meal. So worth it. The portion was huge and very fresh.Anglophones are good here, but practice some basic ordering phrases to get by a bit easier."
/user_details?userid=KoQ9GePZ6PxEGUqVRKjFMw,Carrie T.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Higher-end fancy breakfast place! Everything was really good. They have a ready-to-go food section at the front if you're not looking to have a sit down breakfast.The place was chic with modern/rustic decor. There were plenty of seating areas when we came by for a brunch. The service was great and food came out fairly quickly.We got a hot chocolate and a vanilla latte to start. I've never tasted better hot chocolate, it was super rich with a slight bitter taste, but the brown sugar added the perfect sweetness to balance the dark chocolate. The vanilla latte had the perfect sweetness without even adding the extra brown sugar that was included. We got a beef tartare to share, it had the right amount of seasoning with toasted bread. I got the Duck Confit Sandwich that came with a side salad. It was perfectly toasted with cheese and hints of sweetness. I tried the Maple Chicken Avocado toast and that was also delicious! Highly recommend! It can be a little pricey though, but I think its worth it. I would love to come back to this place to try other things on the menu when I do come back to visit Mtl."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came to this place twice. The first time I took the salmon cake and the portion was very small. This time I had the scrambled eggs with jalapeno peppers. It was good. I thought it would be spicy (jalapeno...) but it wasn't. The portion was ok and it was good. If you come on a weekend, the place is packed and theres a lineup at the door. The first time I was here I had to share a banquet with other people and since it was winter, it was very unconfortable. There just wasn't enough space and we couldn't put our winter coats anywhere. This time we went on a thursday. The place was empty and I had a much better experience. As for the service, our waitress was nice and friendly both times."
/user_details?userid=x0i6NgHySrXWgb17gVMTuQ,Alice C.,"Redwood City, CA",5 star rating,"A cafe with a shop up front, this place serves up some serious brunch food. There are a lot of brunch plates that come in cast iron skillets, as well as bagel breakfasts (get the famous Montréal bagel!) and other small items. I got the brunch with ham, sausage and bacon, complete with scrambled eggs, duck fat potatoes and baked beans on the side. It was scrumptious and delicious! The bacon wasn't the thinly sliced kind, but a hunk of pork belly, which had a hint of sweetness and was very tender. The portion was quite large and I couldn't finish it - plus by the end I really wanted some veggies to go with it. Sort of my fault for ordering the meatiest item on the menu, really. The service was ok (bit slow but similar to other places in town), and the shop in front was lovely and sold a lot of local foodstuff - perfect for a tourist to take back home!"

I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. I ordered LE TOSCA:  Eggs Benedict  with a side arugula salad, sausage & roasted baby potato's topped with the light and creamy hollandaise sauce :) the staff was super friendly and welcoming as well they speak both English & French . Lastly they also have a cute grab and go market section by the main entrance with all types of loca preñada sándwiches / dry snacks and beverages !"
/user_details?userid=ZxPp3Zq3UILBmWhvawOeGw,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",5 star rating,"Ive been coming to Montreal every year for the past 4 years, and i never get tired of it. The air is fresh and crisp, the people are friendly, transport ion is so efficient and the food is AMAZING..We typically wing it when it comes to meals in Montreal. We always plan last minute so we can never get the places we want to go without booking months in advance, but this only applies to dinner, as for lunch, we try to eat local (around the downtown area, where we usually stay) or whatever we are in the mood of. Not too fancy or expensive, cause we rather splurge on dinner.It was Friday morning, we didnt have a heavy dinner the night before so we wanted a slightly denser lunch, rather than a bagel or a croissant. But it turns out not many places are open for brunch/lunch on weekdays in Montreal apparently. It was not easy to find a brunch place. I used Yelp and came upon Le Cartet. It had really good rating and the Le Canton pics was what drew me there. We took the bus, which wasnt too far from downtown, it basically took us a block away from the restaurant. We arrived around a little before noon. There was no wait, but there were a lot of seat taken. I ordered a maple latte and boy was it delicious. No wonder Canada is known for their maple syrup, it was soooo good but to some, it will be very sweet. Even for me, it was a tad sweet. It was good but very hard to drink half way. Maybe on ice it would have been better but since it was cold, i opted for the hot version.As my entree, i got the Le Canton, i think it was the beans that caught my eye. It was a cold morning so i needed something comforting. nothing says comforting than some beans right?The plate came out sizzling and with lots of food. There was really no room for anything. i was not expecting the bacon to be like thick/large chunks of pork belly. it was so good, very juicy and tender. the sausage had that skin where is snapped when you slick into it. The eggs were light and fluffy, potatoes were roasted with lots of herbs.  And finally the beans, it was the best beans ive ever had. It was sweet and smoky and cooked to perfection. It was not too mushy or hard, it was just right. I was so full i couldnt even eat the toast that came with it and i even had to share the platter with my bf.This was definitely the best meal i had during my visit to Montreal this time around. this meal beat out Europea and even Joe Beef. I am definitely going back to Le Cartet, I dont know if i will try another dish since this dish was soooo good."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I come here quite often for brunch out of convenience, but the food isn't extraordinary or anything. The service is always efficient and friendly, and sometimes there's a line and other times there isn't. I don't particularly feel that this is a high-end brunch place. The seating feels quite impersonal for some reason, because people are always coming in and out for the café section of the restaurant.The food here isn't innovative, but they serve the classic brunch food. Summers here are charming, because they have seating on the sidewalk terrasse. Don't know what's the rave, just ordinary breakie! I would give it a 3.5."

Jeff ordered crepes.  Daughter ordered full breakfast.  Son ordered yogurt with fruit and granola.  Grown ups also had cappuccinos.  Everything was delightful.  Kids ate everything on their plates.  We had delightful service.  Like I mentioned, my review could simply be eat here."

The yogurt was thick and creamy, and the house granola was free of peanuts and sesame and was so satisfying. Eggs were poached perfectly, with the yolk still runny. You can also buy the granola for home, as well as other prepared meals, coffee, and pastries. Service: Friendly but a bit slow (hence the 4 star) - we waited about 20 min for water and to place our order, and it felt extra long because we were so hungry!Tip: Breakfast is only served until 11:15am so get there on time! After 11:15 they'll wait 30-45 min and then start lunch. We had to come back a second day once we learned our lesson!"

Their soups are also good and salads are light and fresh.The staff have always been very courteous and pleasant, which is a big thing.  I tend to get analysis paralysis when I have to decide on the spot where to eat...especially in a food court setting! Happily, I can safely say that Le Cartet is my no-brainer go-to resto and I'm guaranteed a nice food experience :dThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is that a few times I've eaten there, there was always at least 1 pesky small black fly, moth or something buzzing around!! It's small so not too crazy but definitely annoying to have to swat it away.  Other than that, I love the ambiance inside. It's bright and well lit, not overly noisy to allow lunch conversation."

I ordered the matcha latte and scrambled eggs with asparagus cheddar cheese. It was delicious. The matcha latte tasted wonderful, with none of that artificial processed matcha flavoring. It was also just the right level of sweet: a little bit to counteract the bitterness of the matcha powder, but not overwhelming. There was even some foam at the top! As for the eggs, they were rich but not too heavy. The asparagus and cheddar cheese combination was a great blend on my palette, and the refreshing green salad balanced the meal quite well. The bread was delicious and had a wonderful texture.Tables also received a free sample of caramel bread pudding upon being seated. Great experience and would love to come back!"

During the lunch hours, you can get a half of any of their sandwiches and a bowl of soup for $15 Canadian. I ordered their grilled chicken, corn, roasted red pepper sammie (forget the name) and their gazpacho soup. My mother got the roasted veggie and fresh Camembert cheese sandwich, also with their gazpacho. BOTH meals were really good! And very filling!! Sandwiches were hot and fresh right out of the kitchen. The cold Gazpacho was creamy and full of flavor. The quality olive oil drizzle on top was a delight. Lots of chicken in mine. Light on the sauce, so nothing was drowned out. The huge strips of roasted veggies on my mother's sammie were sooo flavorful. I feel like Camembert is not used enough, and I was super glad to get a bite :))"

Shortly thereafter, my scrambled eggs with goat cheese showed up. To my surprise, the portion was huge. There was fresh fruit on my plate. And, the smoked salmon that I ordered on the side was perfect (yes capers!). Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great and everyone in the establishment looked to genuinely be pleased.

This place was painful to get to because of the construction and a lot of one ways. The place was very cute and smelled so good. This is just a matter of preference. I got the scrambled eggs with chorizo and avocado. It had great flavor, my only issue is I don't like my eggs on the soft side. I prefer it more cooked. I asked for 1 French toast and instead I got toasted French bread. I didn't know I had to specify the sweet version. But overall good spot for food and the parfaits are delicious."

I was visiting from out of town and it was off season in terms of crowds. There seem to be regular adult having late breakfast, so it was not packed with hipsters or mommies and kids.TO eat I got the Le Canton. It was a lot for me but I sat there until it was all gone. Not use to eating that much meat for breakfast.Only downside to this meal was that i felt it was salty as all heck.  So if you have high blood pressure/hypertension, do NOT get this. The meats harboured way too much sodium. Prob get your daily intake in one meal.I likely would not get that meal again. But there were other menu items that looked really good so I would like to try those in the future with more maple syrup latte."

I got there just before 10am, the place was bustling with hipsters. Not only is it a restaurant but also a mini market. The place is nice and modern, it also has seating outside. I met two of my colleagues there and we quickly ordered our plates along with 3 mimosas. We waited maybe 10 minutes before our food arrived which was pretty decent considering how busy it was. The plates were nice, combinations were good. The salmon croquette was excellent. The ham croissant was delicious. Mimosa were also pretty fantastic. You might be thinking why am I giving it a 1 star then. Two main reasons:First there was hair in my salad which totally grossed me out.Second the response of the waitress Annie when I told her, and I quote ""I hope it wasn't curly"" then she laughed. Maybe she found that funny but I certainly did not.When the bill arrived she charged me full price. That's not good business. Guess I will have to find another hip brunch place."

The scrambled eggs with dill and salmon were also excellent.  However, the best bite came from the croissant which everyone agreed was top notch.  Service is good here and very friendly.  Prices are very reasonable.  I would recommend this place as anyone's primary choice for breakfast in the area."
/user_details?userid=QiciohgD8N6vCty4vGL3pQ,Emily H.,"Louisville, KY",5 star rating,"Le Cartet has turned me on to the deliciousness that is goat cheese in scrambled eggs, and I will be forever grateful.My boyfriend and I decided to brunch at Le Cartet when we visited Montreal, and I really have to credit Yelp with getting us to check out this cozy spot.When you first arrive, you walk through the small specialty foods area. Chocolate bars of all sorts line the wall just beyond the entrance, and other fun food finds (like maple syrup, coffee and olive oil) are to your left. Looking around is a fun distraction while waiting for your table to be called, which for us took about 15 minutes. We were seated along a long table, hip-to-hip with other diners, but that didn't bother us. I ordered the aforementioned scrambled eggs with goat cheese, which came on bread and also came with potatoes roasted in duck fat and fruit. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, so I can could try the Montreal bagels I had heard so much about. And again, these eggs! Just do it! My boyfriend got the Brunch de L'Atlantique, which includes a ramekin of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half of a smoked salmon bagel, a salmon and sweet potato cake, salad and fruit. Now this is a pretty breakfast! I liked the cake the best. It was very similar to a crab cake. And as if all of this food wasn't enough, we enjoyed mimosas and an amuse-bouche that reminded me of coffee cake. The servers seemed experienced with getting diners through quickly -- a must considering how popular this place seems to be -- but our server was very attentive and polite at the same time. He went through the menu with us in English, and answered each question we had. Happily full after our meal, we then took more time to peruse the specialty food offerings and bought quite a few items to bring home to give to loved ones as souvenirs. Getting a great meal and some shopping done at the same time was such a nice benefit, especially considering we had only a few days to spend in this glorious city. One-stop shopping at its finest!"

When entering the store, you will see a various selection of pre-made meals, which is perfect for lunch. Browsing a little bit, most of the plates were hovering around 10$, which includes different salads and sandwiches. However, I was not there for that. I went there for their breakfast. On a weekday morning, the place was relatively not so crowded. I was seated right away. The decor of the restaurant itself was pleasant. Service also was very good. Now to the real talk, the food itself. I decided to go for the ""Canton"" breakfast, which consist of a pan with eggs, beans, potatoes, bacon and ham. That came out to be 16$ before taxes. The portion itself was fair, but would've appreciated more for the price. As for the food quality itself, I cannot say that there was anything special. The eggs were average, the ham itself was a little burnt. Overall, I do not think I would come back as it is a little expensive for what it offers. Great service otherwise!"

The crepes are are very good and quite dense, you may want to take a walk in the old port after. The Brunch sente was more reasonable. The granola yogurt is think and really good. I added some maple syrup to it as well .  I still have a hard time getting use to paying for a regular coffee when almost every other brunch place it's included! it's not like the price of the plate is not allowing for a free coffee :)  However they do include orange juice (still would rather the coffee)."

Such a perfect choice! The atmosphere is lovely. All waitress and I am assuming the owner are ladies, dress in black, super nice. We ordered their lunch specials of sandwich and soup/salad, which came also with fresh bottle of water (free as well as their refills), and bread with butter. The soup was delicious, served inside a tiny pot. My sandwich was amazing, with tons of salmon in it. My boyfriend had a more regular baguette one, but really full of ingredients, with a side of colorful tasty original salad.

The loft-style trimmings in the main dining area, the vaguely French feel to the entrance and window display, the unique blend of supermarket leisure and professional bustle all combine to create a distinct atmosphere. The sit-down experience is comfy, yet retains a certain polish to it. Weekday lunches and weekend brunches are filled with the hum of smartly dressed young professionals. Daily specials range from something as delicate as gazpacho to something as... gung-ho... as pulled pork. Friendly servers buzz around, seemingly in perpetual motion. The ""grab-n-go"" section is not to be ignored, with some pretty tasty salads, meals and snacks, and quite a bit of exotica to peruse. Not a bad place to stop by for supplies as you explore the Old Port."

Show stealer: croissant. So good. Not too flaky but not not too solid either, wasn't too salty or too sweet, simply perfect. Probably the best croissant in montreal. I had the ham removed because i don't eat pork so my croissant came just with cream cheese but I'd rather have nothing on it and just go for plain croissant. I cannot stop fawning about how great the texture and softness of the croissant was. Next time I come, I'm simply getting a good ol' croissant avec cafe.Everything else was great too but honestly the croissant was so good that the rest pales down to it. I also had a latte (they use beans by illy) which was also a rich and smooth blend of milk and coffee, not too bitter. Definitely recommend. All brunch plates also come with bread pudding (not my fav) and (super-duper) fresh orange juice.Best part is the location, situated south of downtown, in the heart of a non-touristy part old port. It's like walking into a perfect life and having your dreams fulfilled in cup of coffee. Great ambience and had a great experience.P.s. hot waiters ;)"

My matcha latte although in a strange and somewhat inconvenient to hold glass was thick, creamy, earthy and truly delicious as a wake up.

It came with a fig and a couple slices of cheese as well. The greek yogurt, however, is the real winner here. So creamy and the granola and blueberries on top were phenomenal. No, I'm not exaggerating. They had some really good greek yogurt! My boyfriend ordered the Des Cantons which comes in an iron skillet and has all types of meat, beans, eggs, and potatoes.

This, surprisingly, was not a huge issue because we ended up only waiting for about fifteen minutes or so, despite the place being packed.2.) The service is quick. Even for a group that size we were in and out around forty five minutes for brunch.3.) The food is amazing. Six out of our eight went with the Brunch Canton which comes with ham, eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, potatoes a slice of toast, as well as a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. It is heavenly. As a bonus, the front of the restaurant is a little delicatessen where they sell a variety of prepared meals, foodstuffs, ***chocolate***, and drinks.

Le Cartet is the BEST food I had in Montreal so far, and for a foodie city I feel like that's a pretty honorable title. It is truly incredible and plated beautifully, with portions that are sure to leave you full. The crepes and French toast were unique in the sense that they came topped with applesauce, raisins and pecans. All things I typically wouldn't eat but together they were heaven. The true favorite at the table was the poached eggs and salmon in toast with potatoes and salad with homemade vinegarette. I was almost about to order another one because my tastebuds were telling me yes but my stomach was telling me no. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Montreal just so I can eat here again."

But luckily we were able to snag one of the few spots left at the long communal table.Two of us ordered the Brunch Toscan, and the other two ordered the Brunch de L'Atlantique. The brunch plates were all huge, and came with a glass of orange juice and coffee each. My Brunch Toscan included poached eggs on English muffins with Mornay sauce, duck fat potatoes, and fresh fruit (orange, grapefruit, and pineapple). The Brunch de L'Atlantique included a smoked salmon bagel, scrambled eggs, salad, sweet potato pancake, and fruit. Everything was delicious, though it seemed like the Brunch de L'Atlantique came with a lot more food!One side of the restaurant is a shop selling chocolates, jams, and other goods, so if you end up waiting for a while you at least have something to look at while you wait.

/user_details?userid=qxuJk8rRr2Fm7OphnzOkoQ,Gwen N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"My go-to spot for brunch whenever I visit Montreal. Le Cartet is usually a reasonably short walk (10-15 mins) when I'm staying downtown. The one time I did have to drive here, parking was found easily on one of the side streets nearby. When you enter the restaurant there's a small shop where you can get various coffee grounds, teas, and sandwiches/salads. I always come rather early, around 8 or 9am (they are open at 7am), so I'm always seated very promptly. There are individual tables for parties of 2/4 and also long communal tables for larger groups. The menu is large with lots of sweet and savoury options. I always get the brunch des cantons that comes with bacon, sausage, ham (not the deli kind), beans, and roasted potatoes in duck fat in a cast iron skillet. The ham is my favourite part of the dish because it's very fatty and tender. If you don't eat much in the morning I wouldn't recommend this unless you are going to share it with someone else. During my last visit our entrees were preceded with some sort of milk/egg bread that whetted our appetites for the rich meal that was to come. The caffeinated drinks are all delectable. I always get the vanilla latte, coffee, or iced coffee when I'm there in the summer. My friend got a cappuccino last time and got the option of either bowl or cup.

But when we aren't really doing much except waiting for our order to be taken there needs to be some sort of order of things. This is more of a friendly socializing place than a place where you get food. The food is alright but it isn't the best it has to offer. With that I'd say this is a sort of quick cafe that turned itself into a brunch place without much room to spare a lunch. In the midst of this chaos there is some room for improvement.

Plus, they offer a wide range of products such bottled smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries and more. Laid-back crowd, cozy ambiance and delicious food. What can you ask for more? If the weather is great, you can even sit outside. This place definitely get off the beaten track."

What a pity that all this time I haven't been blessed with the delicious enlightenment that is le Cartet.To be honest- I've walked by this space several times and just assumed it was a specialty food shop that was ahem, well out of my price range. Don't be deceived like I was; as it turns out it's an amazing sit-down spot as well. My companion had the country-style breakfast, and while the whole thing looked awesome the most note-worthy thing about it is that the potatoes are cooked in duck fat (DUCK FAT POTATOES PEOPLE.) I ordered the ""healthy"" breakfast plate, complete with goat cheese toast and poached eggs; a yogurt parfait; as well as figs and cheese. yum.The space is exactly what you're hoping for- a cozy and accommodating yet classy spot where even when the place is packed you can hear your brunchin' buddies. I can't wait to bring everyone ever here."
/user_details?userid=C3eijwJmz3CqWQ3JOGQB4w,Anh T.,"Vernon Hills, IL",3 star rating,"This place would have been 4 stars if not for the pretentious snobby waitress that we had. This review will be broken down into two parts Service and Food.Service:When seated the waitress came up to us immediately and asked what drinks we wanted. Since we just got seated we had to look at the menu first. She rolled her eyes at us and when my husband asked what soda they served she snapped back with we have everything. Really? You have every soda imaginable stocked? She puts in our drink order at the bar and we can see the drinks are ready but to spite us it took her 20 mins to deliver our drinks. We would eye the drinks and she would look back at us, make eye contact, smirk and then reach for other table's drinks.Additionally, the store serves to go food at the front. My friend has a strict diet due to GI problems and the kitchen refuses any changes to their dishes. The only thing he could eat were some items from the to go section. After explaining the situation, the waitress said NO you cannot get a take out item and eat it at the table. My friend had to leave and get food someplace else.Then another table asked the same thing. The waitress said no but then changed her mind and let the person at that table get food from the takeout section and eat it with their family. Needless to say no tips came from our table.Food:I would say the eggs are the best thing for brunch on the menu. I had the eggs with goat cheese. Very silky and fluffy. The goat cheese added a good sharp flavor. Also ordered some butter croissants. The croissants were average. The ends were dry but the middle part was flakey with a nice buttery flavor. The rest of the table ordered a skillet with eggs, beans, ham, bacon and sausage. All agreed that the ham was very flavorful.Overall, food was good. However, a little expensive. Hope you don't ever get the same waitress that we got."

With a small market in the front, and a super relaxed atmosphere, it was the perfect brunch choice. I walked in with the intention of getting a late breakfast, but decided to go with lunch and get a pulled pork sandwich. It was a flavor bomb! With each bite, I got some of the perfectly toasted sesame bun, the savory pork with the sweet vinegar-style BBQ & a nice crunch from the cabbage slaw. The sandwich cake with nacho chips and a sour cream dip that was super yummy. Oh, my mimosa was also a great choice! I wasn't too thrilled about the butternut squash soup that came with my sandwich. The flavor profile wasn't there and I was a little disappointed. We also weren't offered the yummy bread that everyone talks about & looked for parking for more than half an hour. Otherwise, Le Cartet would have definitely gotten 5 stars."

It specializes in ""overs"" - overrated and over-priced. I'm not necessarily saying that the food is bad - it's just mediocre. Since I used to live in the Old Port, I would still periodically go there. My favorite items were the omelettes (especially the goat cheese one). Coffees are fine (but I'm not expert/connoisseur in this) and fresh juices are tasty (absent the price consideration). Yeah, the goat cheese omelette is definitely the right way to go here (to the point of maybe being objective instead of subjective)."

Great selections of products that lined the walls of the front of the restaurant. I got foie gras in a can and some pate. The pate I got was actually few dollars cheaper than the ones in duty free. There a selection of Italian products, from coffee to truffle oil. We got there around 10:30 on a sunday morning and there's a 20 minute wait, which is not bad. When we left there was a line going all the way outside on a cold windy day.The ambience is casual and has a modern cafe feel to it. Noise level is a bit loud, by wouldn't be bothered by it of you're in a group. I recommend small groups to this place. When we ordered the off the brunch menu we have complimentary bread pudding and freshly squeezed orange juice. Staff was really nice and served us pretty fast. Really great service, asked us of we want to split the check considering our group. Food was delicious. Most of us ordered the Maple Latte, really good and smooth. Overall great experience."

My boyfriend got the English breakfast ( whatever it's called) and he couldn't finish it! He said it was good but the portions are too big (which is not really much of a problem) I guess my four stars is because it's was decently yummy but not amazingly mind blowing. The downside is that it's a bid more expensive than other old port brunches ( I find)."

My first thought? ""Gotta yelp this place"" and I did.So we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch. The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out. He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend. Some time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated. As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another. I told our waitress ""I want that"" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store). $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ. For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each. Pretty sweet deal.The food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish. We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17.99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11.29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich). Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks. The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better. It just kept falling apart.Service was great. Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you."

On weekends, there will definitely be a lot more people so go on a weekday if possible! Both the hubs + I got the brunch des cantons and coffee. Very delicious food + filling! You are first served an amuse bouche - not sure what it was but I think it was some sort of bread pudding but MANNN, if they sold that on its' own, it would be a best seller! Along with your food, you also get orange juice, free of charge too! Each brunch des cantons cost around $19 so to get the freebies makes the food worth it! Also stopped her the day of our departure back home and we picked up a croissant, fruits, and yogurt w/ granola. Delicious but pricy!

My friend had the hot chai latte and she also agreed it was delicious.On our second trip here we both weren't super hungry, and although we really wanted the Toscan breakfast again one more time before we departed for home, it was just gonna be too hearty of a meal. We ordered the avocado toast breakfast. It was very good. I ordered an iced chai latte this time and it was great! One of the best I've had.This place is definitely worth the visit.

On a high note, the vanilla latte was spot on however it would have been nice if they did a little swirly graphic with the milk froth but they didn't.

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing.For coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea. What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!The restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am. We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush. The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends. If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix. They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more.I had Le Brunch Sucre. Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet. To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced. For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet. This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup.The yogurt and their granola also blew me away. The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it. This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency. It balanced everything else in the bowl very well. I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!The butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well. The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time. The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out. It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it.Overall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option. The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm."

My other half got Le Nordique, which he thoroughly enjoyed...he was even kind enough to share some of it with me!The parents both got the salmon bagel plate; they substituted a baguette for the bagel and loved every crunchy bite.

The closest subway is Square Victoria, street parking is available but good luck with that. If you're downtown, it's an easy walk so you can skip transit if you want to get some cardio in.The place: Le Cartet is not excessively big but the layout is good, with simple decor and a pretty plentiful boutique at the front. There's usually a line-up on weekends so you'll want to plan accordingly. We arrived around 10:45 and had to wait, but only for about 15-20 minutes. The goods: I went for the 2 eggs with goat cheese on toast, with a side of potatoes (like, about 4 of them). Can't say one bad thing about this simple but tasty breakfast. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and fluffy and had the right amount of cheese, the bread was fantastic (a multigrain, I think) and the potatoes were good. They also know how to make a mean Macchiato, which always makes me happy since many places do not. Quality goods, all around.Service: The service was good, though the waiter couldn't seem to get our bills right. He had to reprint them twice, and both times, they were wrong.   Price point: I forget the exact amount, but it was on par with other breakfast places in town.

Glad we got there somewhat early!!"

Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint.We started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte. For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork. We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake. Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes.Can't wait to go back for brunch!"

/user_details?userid=r0E8c6_4AOP1NW6eSXT_ig,Jen C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Amazing breakfast! I had the scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and asparagus. Perfectly almost runny eggs on top of country bread. Small portions as the eggs don't cover all the bread. It's about 2 scrambled eggs on top of meant for 3 scrambled eggs. The cheese isn't overwhelming where there is too much or an afterthought where it is put on top after. The duck fat roasted potatoes were rich so don't be alarmed by the fact that there are only 4 halves. You won't eat more than that. The fruit was a nice touch with grapefruit, orange, pineapple and strawberry. My boyfriend had the weekday special of scrambled eggs, beans, ham, bacon, sausage, duck fat roasted potatoes with country bread on the side. The bacon was okay. The sausage was very hard and dry. The ham was however fall of the bone soft and juicy and amazing. Next time I would def do the ham and cheese scrambled eggs."

Almost everyone in our group got Le brunch des cantons. I really enjoyed it, got it with a mimosa and espresso. Good portion size, wasn't stuffed or hungry at the end.Service was great! Loved our server, happy and on point. One person in our group had burnt bacon and she brought better bacon right out before he noticed."

Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly). The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet. The highlight though, was the main meal. I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket. I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries. I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much! Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was delicious! They also have a few outdoor tables. Will definitely be back to try their other menu items!"

It's a pretty solid place, but the long line on weekends for brunch is somewhat off-putting. We figured it must be good if this many people are lining up, so we stuck it out for ~30-45 mins. despite being really hungry! I can't say they manage the line that well. There's a long line and it took me a while to figure out that it was for the coffee/tea counter (you can get a drink to sip on while  you wait). I was confused if it was only a take-out line or not. I stood there for a while, then someone took my name down and added it to a list. We had to awkwardly hang around the boutique section at the front of the restaurant while we waited (mmm, everything there looks so tasty... fancy olive oils, Kusmi teas, pre-made salads...). I can see why it's popular -- the decor is very understated-chic and the communal tables are nice. Food-wise, I expected more and price-wise, I wouldn't say they offer great value (brunch plates $15-16). I had the brunch Cartet which was huge. I liked that it came with a big salad. The croissant with ham and goat cheese was yummy. The scrambled eggs were kind of cold and the salmon was just ok. My DC's eggs benny looked overcooked; the yolk wasn't drippy like it's supposed to be. Definitely get a mimosa though. That's something they do well here and after the long wait, you'll need one."

Major fan of not just the presentation but also the creamy and flavourful soupDuck leg with scalloped potatoes and arugula salad - Duck leg was very filling (in a good way) and scalloped potatoes were so, so satisfying. Neither of us like arugula and forgot to sub it out but it did look good. Pulled pork sandwich - Chips and pickles on the side. A bit of a kick to the pulled pork, brioche bun was on point, perfectly toasted. Carrot cake - Soooooo moist. Cream cheese icing was tart and not too sweet. Tons of nuts and raisins in the cake.

The first thing to note is the emphasis on the brunch element of the brunch platter - this will do you for two meals. My ""Le Cartet"" plate came with a ham and goat cheese croissant (buttery, flaky, light cheesy, smoky ham, YUM), a scrambled egg, a small cup of greek yogurt, a fruit shish kabob (strawberry, orange, grapefruit, pineapple), two slices of cheese, a fig, a salmon cake, and mesclun salad.) WHEW. I could not eat it all. The mimosa was quite strong with pulpy (fresh squeezed?) orange juice. Presentation is important to me, I like my food to look and smell good as well as taste spectacular, and here, too, Le Cartet was a huge hit. The fruit shish kabob was cute, and the salmon cake served as a nice hub for a hub and spoke-esque plate presentation. In addition the plates come with coffee and juice! And I almost forgot the beginning of the meal - a coffee cakeish amuse bouche. Delightful! Each of the flavors was smooth and tasty - not too much salt, everything was balanced by lovely creaminess.

Nonetheless, location wise, this plate is located a little bit far down in a remote area of old port. The restaurant itself is nice, cozy and I love the ambiance of the restaurant. They also sell a small amount of different type of food ranging from to go soup to coffee. Indeed, it does look like a cool spot to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee along side a dessert.Anyway, I had to opted for the meal plate of the day a western variation of Middle East couscous with merguez sausages and cury chicken. Anywho, the plate was okay, I didn't personally fancy this couscous because I thought it lacked some flavour. The sausages didn't have the authentic flavour but still had a western juice inside. Nonetheless, props to the chicken it was cooked perfectly and had an excellent taste. The plate also came with a salad, that was obviously fresh and done with great care.My partner had a latte and a fruit salad. No bad points about these two choices since they both were excellent .Overall , this place feels like a really good joint for coffee or brunch.

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If there's one thing that I've noticed so far about the Old Port food scene, it's that it tends to be a 50/50 toss up between quality cuisine and overpriced tourist traps. Le Cartet fits more into the first category with a bit of the price factor of the latter. Located in a nice part of the area, it has an open and aesthetically pleasing layout to go along with the food served, a plus that never hurts.I ordered the ""Le Nordique"" platter and a maple latte to go along with it. The maple latte, while it didn't have too much of a coffee taste to it, tasted delightful in regards to the quality of the maple flavoring without being overbearingly sweet. The Nordique platter consisted of a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict on a base of some type of black bread, a side salad, and some roasted potatoes. Raw onions garnished the Eggs Benedict, which I picked out since I absolutely detest them, but other than that they it was a really yummy dish. The bread base was also quite amazing and tasted more wholesome than your generic English muffin/white bread. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and seasoned so that they didn't taste bland like how potatoes often become, and the salad had a nice, light dressing to go along with it. The only issue that I had with the dish was that for $15.50, it seemed a bit pricey for how much food they gave, even though it was presented nicely. Le Cartet is definitely a great place if you want to enjoy a nice brunch in a chic environment. I would save it for occasions that lean more toward the special side, however, unless you have enough dough to spend on a regular basis (which as a university student I do not have, unfortunately)."

However if you have a sweet tooth they give you a packet of raw sugar on the side. My girlfriend had the mocha and it too was quite delicious. I've never had a great mocha, and this cute little Cafe hit the spot. Food was in generous portions and cheap compared to most brunch places.

/user_details?userid=J0Qq1fWdTjm_OyTQryTD-A,Daphne M.,"ASTORIA, NY",5 star rating,"Rules for visiting Montréal:1. Go to Le Cartet Boutique for brunch. 2. I don't care what else you do after. 3. Confirm that step 1 was done.When visiting a city, I love finding the places locals like to eat (doesn't every yelper?). I'm intimidated by all things French, but Le Cartet had such glowing reviews, I couldn't say no. Awesome decision. The brunch menu has tons of variety, so whether you're in the mood for meat with a side of meat (ham, sausage, and bacon in one dish!) or a simple serving of fresh fruits, they have it. Prices are reasonable, especially after the USD to CAN conversion, so go nuts and get a mimosa while you're at it. Service was great, our server was friendly and our food came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. I got the L'Atlantique dish which had a salad, an open face smoked salmon with schmear bagel, fresh fruits, and some apple chocolate chip thing I can't pronounce. I was also supposed to get a sweet potato fritter thing, but the server told me earlier they were out and would substitute by pretty much giving me more of everything else. Cool.Whatever the hell the chocolate chip apple thing was,  it was DELICIOUS.  Super moist and not too sweet, I would have preferred to have it at the end of my meal instead of the beginning, but I devoured it nonetheless. The salad was perfectly dressed and the everything about the dish garnered zero complaints from me. Like I said, they didn't have the fritter that came with my meal, so I'm not sure if the scrambled egg with salmon was a replacement or normal part of the meal. All the fruits were at the peak of freshness and sweetness, too. My friend got the very simple scrambled eggs with goat cheese on toast.. and if I could give it ten stars, I would. If you can make something simple taste out of this world, that's a dang gift. All the right balance of salty, creamy, rich, crunch from the toast and sweetness from the side of fresh fruit made this so incredible that we're seriously considering going back to Montreal just to eat here again."

I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad. I really dislike their system of waiting in line... Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!Once inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two. I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice. For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan. The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling. I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent. The reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks. It's such a cute place!"

Their brunch options are great as you can get an appetizer, main course and mimosa for under $20. There are also lighter options for those who are not as hungry. I ordered the Trios Minutes which was a boiled egg with 2 whole wheat toasts and fruit. It was great for a light breakfast. My sister ordered the Brunch De L'Atlantique which was a seafood's lover dream. It included 1/2 smoked salmon bagel, scrambled eggs with salmon and a salmon cake. This was served with fruit as well. Le Cartet also has a baked goods and specialty foods section which is great to pick up something after your meal. I got an almond croissant for a snack on the road back to Toronto.

I like plating consistency esp when you can count the fruits (I had one less strawberry, pineapple and orange i.e. I only had three fruits on my plate).

I always thought that the old port was overrated and mostly a tourist trap but who am I to refuse a new brunch experience. I should have. It was very disappointing. 1. The food was burnt and served cold. I still tried to eat it but then gave up since the potatoes and beans were dry, the bacon was stuck to the hot plate. 2. Service was terrible. two times we had to ask for food items that were missing on our plates. Like bread and jam which is basic. No fruit salad. and no ""mise-en-bouche"". To top it off, when the waitress finally arrived 30 min with those items, she only brought 1 portion. at that point I was done arguing. I can take bad service, good food and vice versa but BOTH? no way. That was my first and last time at Cartet."
/user_details?userid=iksyi661x5fvITvB2ISNlw,Melissa K.,"Atlanta, GA",2 star rating,"I'm still a bit stuffed from eating here so I thought it would be a great idea to write my review while my memory of the place is fresh and clear.We stumbled across Le Cartet after receiving the cold shoulder over at Olive & Gourmando and while in many regards I'm very glad we did, I do have to say that I had numerous disappointments when you compare price with product.Let's start with the good, eh?The space is open and clean, and houses not only the bustling restaurant but also a small store that sells (overpriced) food items.  Gave us lots to watch.  It is LOUD in there so you might want to cure that hangover a bit before heading in...I had a clear view of the folks behind the counter and everyone was hustling their butts off to try to ensure things - juices, coffees, food - were doled out quickly.English menu had the same items as the French one which is always a welcome experience.Communal seating.  It gave us an opportunity to strike conversations with people on both sides of us.Espresso was excellent.Wait time was reasonable.The ham on the des Cantons plate was one of the best meats I've ever had.  I normally eschew pork products (except when in Prague and at my Grandma's during the holidays) but when the hubby told me I needed to try it (from his plate) then I did.  Actually, all the ham was excellent because my croissant with goat cheese and ham was great as well.  I'd normally have passed the meat off to him but this time I actually ate it!  It wasn't as good as his portion due to different curing/prep styles but it was still better than 98% of the ham I've ever eaten.Server was friendly.Now, on to the bad.The seating system is stupid.  On a rainy day we were lucky to already have made it into the doorway but the people behind us were drenched and confused.  There is no name taking.  Stay in line or else you lose your place.  And in a narrow entrance you constantly have to move around to ensure everyone is getting where they need to be.  God forbid you try to walk past everyone to look in the store or they'll snipe and snarl at you about breaking line.  Sheesh.  Hangry folks over there.  Just trying to pass the time, ok?While our server was friendly she was non-existent.  We never got our orange juice that was included in the meal because by the time she (or anyone) showed back up we were too full to want it anymore.  But since we technically paid for it I think they should have brought it with our food, no?  Especially since they allow absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  The couple next to us was trying to have a plate with no pork and the refused to remove it from the croissant (where it's just placed in) and had them order a la carte at a cost of almost $8 more.  To NOT have an item?  Especially when they explained it was for religious purposes?  That's sillier than the seating system.The juice isn't fresh squeezed even though I was told it was.  As I was drinking my average tasting mimosa I witnessed them pop open a fresh jug o' juice with a distinct distribution label.  I don't mind a good jug o' juice.  Really.  But don't tell me you squeeze your juice when you don't.  And then not bring it to me.  I'm still a bit miffed about not getting my juice I guess.Bloody Mary is weak and out of a can.Salad was hot.  Not 'wilted' warm but downright hot.  Weird?Eggs were way overcooked but, again, we had no one to tell to rectify that situation.Really a 2.5 star experience but rounding down when factoring in cost.  For over $65 for breakfast for two people I don't think I'll be back nor could I recommend."

Plus the staff was all very friendly which made the experience even more enjoyable.  Stopped by the bakery to get some of their almond cakes to go.  The matcha almond cake was to die for.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and nice flavour inside.  Definitely try that if you can.  The chocolate cherry muffin was too sweet for my taste and not a lot of cherries inside.  Overall, a place that I'd return and I think its'a sold place to go for breakfast/brunches.    Pretty popular place and doesn't take reservations, I'd go early or expect a queue."

My husband ordered the brunch des cantons which was a skillet with scrambled eggs, beans and an assortment of meat.  The beans weren't from a can and had a nice sweetness to it.  There was some pork which pretty much melted in your mouth because it was so tender.  The other meats in the skillet were rather lacklustre.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with cheese and asparagus.  It was warm but not hot - there was a significant difference in temperature between my husband's dish and my own (and yes I know his was in a cast iron skillet but still, food should be hot).  The eggs were cooked well (not overdone) but the lack of seasoning and relatively cool temperature of the dish made it a bit off putting. I also ordered a smoothie which interestingly wasn't very chilled (I prefer my smoothies nice and cold) but was otherwise quite tasty.  My husband ordered a bowl of latte which had a very milky taste.

The line can get a bit long, but usually with a party of 2 the wait is no longer than 10 minutes. That being said, the wait feels fast I because the walls are covered in exotic chocolate and there is the little market in front with gourmet goods. I always enjoy browsing this section when we're with a bigger group and the wait is long.In terms of best menu items: the latte bowl is a must! No weekend is complete without it. The hot chocolate is also extremely delicious. My favourite brunches are Brunch Sante and Atlantique, but my boyfriend swears by Le Cartet brunch. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here. I highly highly recommend it."

And I should also add they appear to have an extensive chocolate bar selection, both international and quebecois.  I will definitely be going back for those!"

They were ok, but we're talking about straightforward variations on eggs and potatoes. The space is beautifully designed, hovering somewhere between rustic and hip, but it was filled with flies (see above under ""please reconsider"").

The portion size is very good, especially when you order the Le Cartet specials. The amuse bouche, which are included in all of their specials, is typically bread pudding and they are absolutely delicious! It's a must try! I highly recommend getting the Le Cartet Atlantique. It is a smoked salmon inspired dish, that includes a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon (you can ask to switch to a different type of bread), salmon omelette, salad, fruit, and orange juice. Their croissants are decent, but not the best."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A beautiful Sunday morning in the city always lends itself to a nice brunch. A couple of Sundays ago, the family was downtown for the weekend so it was the perfect opportunity to head down to old Montreal for a nice family meal. For the occasion, we decided to try out Le Cartet, a place that I had heard many good things about but hadn't had the chance to try yet. This restaurant and boutique offers breakfast and lunch as well as a takeout menu for the many workers in the area during weekdays . On the weekend, the focus switches to brunch. We arrived for the beginning of the brunch service and were able to grab one of the last tables in the back so thankfully we didn't wait long. Given the lineup that was present on our exit an hour later, we made the right call to arrive early. The space is a perfect morning spot - tons of natural lighting, plain white walls and high ceilings. It's a tight fit with everyone cramming in for brunch but still comfortable. The brunch menu at Le Cartet is a combination of classic brunch dishes with some extra twists. The first dish that we ordered was their Coupe Santé - Fresh fruit salad, greek yogourt, blueberries, ginger-honey organic granola and cashew nuts. Wherever they get their greek yogourt, my family would love to know because it was some of the best we've ever had. I love blueberries so that's the perfect option to pair with the yogurt and the granola was wonderful as well - a nice subtle hint of both honey and ginger. Mix everything together and you get a very nice yogurt parfait. The lightest option we tried and a hit for all of us.The second dish we got was the Brunch Cartet - Scrambled eggs with mesclun salad, ham croissant, goat cheese and a sweet potato salmon cake. This was the most unconventional plate we ordered. I could take or leave the salad - it was good but rather unremarkable. The scrambled eggs were very done as one would hope from a breakfast/brunch place. The croissant was fresh and flaky, the ham was solid and the goat cheese was a nice creamy rich touch to a otherwise light plate. The real star in the end however was the salmon cake - nice crunch on the outside while keeping a flaky context inside. I would have loved that element to be more plentiful compared to the rest but a solid dish nevertheless.The final dish was le Brunch des Cantons - Scrambled eggs with country ham, sausage, bacon, baked beans, toast and roasted herb potatoes cooked in duck fat. This dish was completely in my wheelhouse which makes the fact that I didn't order it all the more shocking! Great items here - all the meats were delicious and I am always a sucker with anything cooked in duck fat.Each of these dishes came with an amuse-gueule to enjoy before the meal however we didn't get them during our meal! Our waiter, realizing his mistake, gave us a mini-bag of them on our exit - sucre a la creme. Deliciously rich and sweet - this ended up being a nice way to end the meal rather than start it.Le Cartet was a solid brunch experience - all the dishes were well executed and the service was quick and to the point. Its location makes me a perfect starting point for a nice afternoon in Old Montreal. Whether or not I would stand in line to eat there however is a different question all together. In the end, I would easily recommend you give them a shot -  however arrive early otherwise your day in the old port will become a quick afternoon stroll. Cheers!"

Probably the best meal I had in Montreal.We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, around 10. There were quite a few empty tables, but by the time we left the place was full and there was a line for seating. I ordered the Brunch Toscan. Basically egg's Benedict, with a side of potatoes, assorted fresh fruit, along with some really delicious coffee and freshly squeezed OJ. The egg's Benedict was bomb, and not overly salty and the sauce was rich, but not overpowering. The fresh fruit wasn't the normal crappy fruit you get at most places. Stawberry, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Yummy. All that food and drink for 16 bucks, not a bad deal at all. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and like a true brunch, couldn't even think about eating for many hours after. I also got to eat some of their fresh baguette and croissant. Both were excellent! This is a MUST on every trip to Montreal, and I will definitely be back when I return."

We waited on line for a total of maybe 10-15 minutes and was luckily seated at a two-person table. You WILL get seated next to strangers at a larger table (especially during busy hours), so for those who find settings like that uncomfortable, I would recommend you tell the hostess first thing. I can't exactly remember the brunch combo I ordered but it consisted of a bagel with CC and smoked salmon, some scrambled eggs, a sweet potato pie cake, along with fruit on the side. The combo plates are very big and are served in appropriate portions so you leave feeling satisfied in all aspects. My boyfriend ordered the crepes and really enjoyed the little pastry served with applesauce and blueberries. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee and fresh orange juice. Overall, a great brunch experience and highly recommended."

All in all the place is way overpriced for what you get - middle of the road quality and not always fresh. Beware of the grab and go options. The salads can be old, lettuce wilted, and tasteless across the board. The cookies are hard, and they ain't biscotti. The espresso is Illy brand so it's pretty good. They sell so many food products, it could be a mini (overpriced) general store. If the pickings are slim, which they can be in this area, it is a good bet but Cartet is not a place to go out of your way for. Its a place that's the best of the not so great."

We luckily came a little early and didn't wait longer then 10 mins (bonus: outside tables are just first come and taketh- you don't have to wait on the line)Pros: -The most delicious breakfast I have had in a very very very long time. I ordered a salmon bagel plate. It's came with a bagel with lox and cream cheese with onions and these deliciously huge capers. The bagel was thin, crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. It also came with a salmon biscuit (baked salmon and some flour) which was flavorful and not too dry. There was also a side omelet which I just couldn't fit in my stomach. And some fruit and small salad. My boyfriend had a delicious breakfast meat platter with fried beans served on cast iron. Came with some delicious toast too. I woke up today dreaming about another breakfast like this. It's a most to visit."

The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and taste divine. - The benedict comes with a fresh glass of OJ, I LOVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!- Latte was goodService- The service was great from beginning to end- The waiters were very busy, but came by to check on us at all the right times.

If you look at the pictures I uploaded to Yelp, you'll see that Le Cartet chefs care about presentation and good food. Their yogurt with blueberries and muesli was REALLY tasty.

Otherwise, there are bunch of other places in Montreal with 10 times better service. The food is ok, nothing special. But I think they don't think their customers as returning customers they don't really care about the service that much. If you're a tourist in Montreal, it means that you have the time to take the cab or the metro to go places. Spend 20 more minutes and go to Lawrence, Manitoba or VORO. Eat better, experience a nicer place. At the end, that's why you're visiting Montreal!If you're a local, I'm pretty sure you won't go here anyways, unless your friends are like ""Oh, we found this place but don't remember the name.

They're really..... Hit or miss sometimes. I'd say 80% of the time, their meal of the day is a hit... But you don't really know what the meal will be ahead of time and sometimes the meal itself might not be your thing. Their duck confit with side of salad has been 60% hit, 40% miss. When it misses, it feels like the duck is old. I don't know how else to describe it. Their sandwiches are usually good but when they're not, it's probably because the inside is still cold and you realize they probably just half heated it up when they took it from the grocery section. The foods from their grocery section I've enjoyed but check the packaged date. I would try to go for items packaged today or yesterday. Their cookies are delicious. Even if they're 4$ a pop."

We came during a weekday and the place was filled with tourists. There are no hostesses to seat you; you are expected to simply walk in and find a table. The restaurant is lovely, it has extremely high ceilings, and windows that allow the morning sunshine to pour in. The service is friendly. The food  is just not as spectacular as it appears in the pictures. My partner and I each ordered a scrambled eggs plate. The scrambled eggs with chorizo tasted like something a high school student could've made. The plates were huge, but they looked half empty.  Each plate came with four small pieces of potatoes   and  three pieces of fruit (1 strawberry, 1 slice of orange and 1 slice of grapefruit). The pain brioche was actually 12 grain bread, which I didn't mind.  Then again, they may just be placing whatever they have on hand.  I suppose I am very disappointed because after seeing all the reviews, I was expecting a little more on my plate for the $12 we paid. It was satisfactory for breakfast, but with all the amazing brunch places available in town, I am not sure I would recommend le Cartet at this point. I would have to try one of their bigger plates the next time."

I was excited to get there at 11am on a weekday to find the kitchen open, but my happiness was crested when I found out that only a limited menu was served in the time between breakfast and lunch. So, begrudgingly, I chose a goat cheese and vegetable frittata -- one of only two options available. Given that there were only two options, I thought I'd get some sort of half-assed meal, but I was totally wrong -- the frittata was awesome: fluffy, perfectly cooked, and served in an individual glazed cast iron ramekin (I'm a sucker for food in individual compartments). I also ordered orange juice, which was fresh-squeezed but not too pulpy.  On my way out, I grabbed some prepared food from the cold cases near the front of the shop to stock the fridge in my nearby rental. Delicious, and without the prefab food taste or feel you might get at other delis.  The best thing about my visit, however, was non-food related -- the cafe has this great artwork on the walls by an artist named James Kennedy (jameskennedy.ca), who uses hot rolled steel to produce these really interesting (and reasonably priced) pieces. My partner and I dug the art so much, we contacted the artist and purchased a piece. So, thanks to Le Cartet, I left with a happy tummy AND a very cool souvenir of my trip to this amazing city. :)"

It's that good.I was a little nervous about the communal seating - I'm a big dude and not always the most social fellow, so I thought I'd find being packed in next to total strangers to be very uncomfortable. It turned out to be fine. I think the fact that the people on either side of us were speaking French and we were speaking English helped it feel less weird. Plus, I had more room at this communal table than I usually have on the train or even in some restaurants where the ""individual"" tables are like six inches apart.The food was just fantastic. Seriously amazing. You know how when you're a kid if you say you love something someone says ""If you love it so much, why don't you marry it?""

We got there for brunch around 10:30am on a Sunday morning and the line was already well out the door for a table, so I would suggest getting there early. We got lucky and since all the people ahead of us were parties of 3 or more and we were just 2, we got to jump the line and only waited about 15 min total. I had the scrambled egg with asparagus and chedder on toast, with fruit and potatoes. The egg was actually pretty good, but the toast was a bit burned and too crispy. The fruit was fresh and enjoyable. As for the potatoes, I generally love potatoes made any way, but I didnt like them at all and only ate a bite. Im not sure why you would cook potatoes in duck fat, because it mostly left them just tasting weird and too sweet (to me, Im aware other reviewers loved them).  Overall it was an acceptable breakfast, but I wouldnt go back.

I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. I was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. I ATE I had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Le meh.

I have a nut and sesame allergy and to say the least it was very hard eating here. Everything I wanted to eat had nuts in it. At most places I go to they are accommodating and are able to change up the meal or take out the nuts (or sesame). But at Le Cartet everything was ""premade"". Even a spread on a piece of bread was premade so I was unable to have that dish. In the end I asked for about 4 different dishes and had to settle on the 5. I bet the food was good just wish I could have eaten what I wanted. On the other hand, the people I was with enjoyed their meals. One of them had to send their dish back since it was not hot enough but after that they enjoyed it."

It's not comfortable and it's not cool to eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers, especially when one person is coughing continuously and it's so hot in the room you know it's a hotbed of colds and flu waiting to happen. It's a condo decor-as-restaurant-themed location that's so over and tired; but if the diners are impressed, who cares, because they don't know any better.Food: For lunch, quiche (too many rosemary sprigs), and pulled pork sandwich (cinnamon, cumin, and clove?) and leek soup with hard pieces of stalk.Service: When the server removed our plates that were more than 2/3 full, there was no question about whether we liked our dishes. There are better places in the neighbourhood by far."

With the help of Yelp, I found Le Cartet.The space is long and thin, going way, way back. There is lots of space if you are coming with a bigger group, but it was pretty busy. If they take reservations (I'm not sure, the three of us walked in) it would be a good idea to make some for a larger group. You walk through a small market on your way in where you could grab pre-packaged sandwiches, salads and the like if you're in a hurryPart of what attracted us to this place was the really nice brunch options -  they're definitely unique. I really liked that you could order dishes that included a little bit of everything, perfect for someone like me who often has angst about what we're forgoing to order our meal. I had the Brunch Cartet, he had the Burnch Toscan and his mum had the Brunch de l'Atlantique. Everyone really enjoyed everything, though my scrambled eggs were cooked harder than I prefer and the croissant wasn't as flakey as you can sometimes get in Montreal, the variety made up for it. Go with an appetite, though, because all of these brunches are a lot of food!The fresh Illy coffee was also tasty and especially appreciated because it was a chilly morning, and I liked that coffee and fresh squeezed juice were included with brunch (or a mimosa! but none of us partook) It was a little pricey for breakfast, but not too bad for brunch (around $17 each) I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch or breakfast in Old Montreal, which is an area that can be really hit and miss for food."

However, the server quickly took our name and we only waited about 15mins to be seated. Our wait gave us time to peruse the grocery store section - the shelves were filled with a plethora of goodies; olive oils, chocolates, gourmet pastas, preserves.... made me wish I was a better cook!We loved the restaurant with its open kitchen, high ceiling and bright airy feel. The little decor details, fall flowers and mini pumpkins, were a nice touch. We were seated at the communal tables - you have just enough space to eat comfortably and its great if you enjoy a little eavesdropping like I do!Menu isn't extensive but well thought out - there's bound to be a choice for you whether you're feeling ""sucré, salé or santé""Their specials (all about $15) come with coffee and juice (or a mimosa for a little extra!)Rather than bread, they brought us a few pieces of apple cake to start - delicious and a nice detail. I had the Brunch des Cantons - their version of the big breakfast - served in a cast iron pan. It had ham, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, and potatoes, as well as a side plate of bread and fruit.  It was good and filling without being too heavy.Service was good - attentive but not overly so.

It's a naturally-lit, airy, above street space, where solo business guys on their laptops nestle up next to brunching felines on one side and a young family with a highchair on the other.Service can run at a snail's pace. Attempt to catch the server's eye or get ready to wait a while for an order to be taken or the bill to arrive. Coffees are fresh, juices are fresher. The ham and eggs breakfast is okay - a couple of pieces of thinly sliced salty ham and eggs scrambled, boiled or poached. But what makes it worth it? The duck fat fried potato wedges.

/user_details?userid=EAc2mmfsfT3LgRpoDFU0QQ,Lilac B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is ridiculous. I recently gave it another chance and hated it even more the second time. The menu is almost hostile to vegetarians, things like potatoes are fried exclusively in duck fat and they make it very clear that no substations are allowed. So expect to pay full fare for scanty portions and possibly missing options. The second time I went we waited in line for about half an hour. When we reached the front of the line we asked to have a table on the terrace which had just opened up. As the waitress was about to seat us, a woman from the back of the line said she had ""reserved"" it because it's ""first come first serve on the terrace"". So in the minute that we were talking to the hostess, she had ""called"" the table from the back of the line. The hostess said she hated that rule, but gave her the table anyway. If this sounds like this makes no sense, it doesn't. I wanted to walk out at that point but my friend was hungry so we stayed and were seated indoors, where it was very hot and stuffy. There is no sound treatment inside and the noise level can be deafening, with the kitchen being open and all. Staff are irritable and seem overworked. The food is way overpriced for the quality, the coffee was pretty good."

/user_details?userid=RqR1bGDgdOPyHDnI73LeFw,Marc D.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"* Nice physical spot, ok brunch *The physical layout of this spot is really nice.  It is a long narrow space with painted brick walls and wooden tables, along with about 8 sidewalk tables.  There is also a small food market towards the front, which had a very nice selection of chocolate and some local products like smoked duck in a can, etc.  I had brunch at one of the sidewalk tables.  The brunch included:- A sweet bread (not sweetbreads, but a cake like bread, which we were never served although saw all of the other tables getting)- A smoked salmon egg scramble, where the whites and yolks were not fully incorporated to each other- Half a bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers (tasty local bagel with nice quality salmon)- A sweet potato and salmon cake (was a bit cold and crumbled apart but had nice salmon flavour)- A green salad (which was good, but slightly overdressed)- Some cut fruit (fine)- A glass of orange juice (unfortunately not fresh squeezed)- Coffee or tea (I had a nice quality tea, although the water was not as hot as it should be)The sidewalk tables suffer from the attack of many bees.  The two women at the next table had a constant battle (probably their strong perfume was saving our table a bit from the onslaught - but we had our fair share as well over the course of the meal).  My side tip - open some of the confiture packs and place them away from your table to attract the bees away - it seems to basically work!  Overall the brunch was ok, but nothing I would rush back for."

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I'm always on the lookout for a cool place to get good eats during my lunch hour at work. One of my coworkers introduced me to Le Cartet, apparently the cat's meow of a fine foods market doubling as a gourmet restaurant.At first glance, one's appetite comes alive just by looking at the restaurant/food store. The setting is absolutely gorgeous. It has the feel of an American general store from an old mill town, fused with a very modern feel. Every little detail has been exhaustively looked over by a very crafty team of designers. The staff is meticulously dressed and hired to look the part the restaurateurs desired. No Saran Wrap here, it's a fine plastic wrapping you would find in a flower shop to pack roses. The facing of the product is immaculate. The table settings are just inviting and warm. It just reeks of Old Montreal Goodness. Local stars and Olympic athletes can be spotted grabbing a bite there.It just looks perfect.Emphasis on the ""looks"". Sometimes a cake is crap but the icing makes it look good enough to eat anyway. And Le Cartet is such an example.Let me take you through the culinary ordeal I went through. Let's begin with the salad entrée I took. A simple looking salad, which is the way it should be to kick-start one's digestion properly. It comes with a vinaigrette de Provence. Unless you have unclean or not so fresh lettuce, the dressing makes or breaks the salad. When I say Provence, if you enjoy wine, a nice wine-based dressing will most likely come to mind. Certainly not chili peppers, which are from Central and South America. Well, the dressing was made up of mostly chili peppers. Not being a lover of spicy foods (I feel spices take away the tastes of the food I'm eating) I immediately put aside the spice-ridden salad because it was awful.Next in my meal was a simple egg salad sandwich on rye bread. I should spell that drye bread. It was too dry even for a corned beef sandwich. But wait, it gets worse. How they accomplished this is beyond me, but the egg salad was also dry. A good mayonnaise should be tangy and moist; I couldn't taste anything of the sort other than flat, boring mayonnaise. Throw in some herbs at least or some garlic, give it some punch. And the piece of Romaine lettuce still had the heart attached to it. It was big enough to choke someone. But since I had to eat something and I wasn't about to dole out another fifteen dollars for lunch, I finished the sandwich, washing it down with water so it could pass my oesophagus; yes it was that damn dry. But that's not all. Since it was my first run at the restaurant I even treated myself to some dessert -- a lovely Tarte Tatin. This, for the uninitiated, is good ol' apple pie from France -- basically your regular apple pie but with the top caramelised with butter and sugar. Caramelised, not carbonised into extinction. When I took my first bite, hoping that the dessert would save me from this so far revolting experience, I cringed when I smelled the charred layer of burnt sugar and it was too late. The final straw.The only thing that tasted okay was the water -- the one in the Evian bottle.The problem with gourmet restaurants is that they fear the fat -- if you want taste, you must embrace the fat. It's what makes food taste good, end of story. Slap on some butter, some cream, or some punchy mayonnaise. The fat is the drummer of the food band. If you ain't got the beat, if you ain't got the rhythm, it's all for naught.The restaurant gets a point for impeccable presentation and none for anything else. A big fat one out of five. Want good French cuisine in Old Montreal?  For lunch, stick to Cluny's, and put a cross over Le Cartet."

/user_details?userid=0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"Probably one of the best breakfast experiences I've had.I chose Le Cartet for my first breakfast in Montreal, a Sunday morning.  The reviews for L'Avenue had stated the very long lines on Sunday, so I figured I'd do that on Monday instead.  Well much to my surprise, there was a long line here as well (about 25 minutes around 9:30am), and if it wasn't a sunny morning, you'd be stuck out in the rain or snow - as the line goes out the door and down the stairs to the outside.  Regardless, it's such a charming setting on the southern end of Rue McGill.  Once I was seated, I took in the minimalistic pleasantness of the restaurant.  High ceilings, rustic, white walls and columns, and it's set up like a long corridor with what appears like one, long table creating a communal setting, and also the option of separate tables around.  Each table was adorned with a huge, clear vase of fully-stemmed sunflowers!  One of my favorites!  I ordered the Brunch Sante, which consists of two poached eggs over toast that has been smeared in an herbed goat cheese and topped with greens, a side of yogurt mixed with granola and blueberries (the best), a dried fig, two medium-sized white cheddar sticks, a skewer of fresh fruit... and before they even bring it out, they give you a small cube of this delicious, most chocolate chip cake/pastry that gets all melty in your mouth full of Illy coffee.  This was easily my favorite meal from the entire trip!  It beats L'Avenue in terms of a clean, healthy, nutrient-rich breakfast - and the presentation is lovely.  Service is wonderful.  So sweet and caring.  It's $14.95, which is a decent deal for the amount of food you get (I eat like a pig and I couldn't finish), and it's worth every dime.  I can't wait to return again for breakfast, and also for lunch.  Don't skip Le Cartet if you're ever in Montreal.  It's on the way from downtown to Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal/Old Port), and a great stop along the way."

/user_details?userid=NqZJMXmwEtirJvx-qpyLmQ,Barrett L.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Located on a broad yet quiet stretch of McGill near the Old City, Le Cartet looks like jumps straight out of the pages of a travel guide.  It's a big lofty space with crafty art pieces hanging on white brick walls, with lamps hanging down from the ceiling.  Diners are packed close together at small tables or at one of the larger communal ones.  With a small market boutique in the front and the restaurant operation in the back, it practically screams twee, but the food is good and the service is quick.After waiting for 20-30 minutes to sit down, I ordered the Atlantic breakfast platter, while the BF opted for the Sweet.  Both of our plates included coffee (and a mimosa for a few bucks more), as well as an avalanche of food.  My dish included scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel dressed with lox, cream cheese, onions, and capers, a mesclun salad, fruit, and a salmon croquette, and it was more than enough.  Everything tasted really good on the whole, although the croquette was a bit dry and crusty.  His dish included crepes, french toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola.  The crepes were very good; not too sweet but just the right amount.  The french toast was not nearly as tender as I normally like (tasted a bit dry), but the subtle addition of the nuts, as well as the applesauce, added a bit of complexity.The menu is varied enough without being overwhelming, and the vibe is very mixed.  There are young people, old people, families, couples, and singles.  Considering what we ordered, the prices are pretty reasonable.  My only complaints would be the lack space available for people to wait for tables, as well as eating in.  It also may be a bit noisy if you're trying to carry on a conversation.  But otherwise, this is a perfectly fine brunch spot with good food and a great atmosphere/scene."
/user_details?userid=L4b1mw47A8AWWMOGrAY9_w,Cynthia L.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,"Again, the yelp posting says its ""Good for Kids: Yes"" and I disagree slightly.  It's probably good for kids who can sit in their own seat and not in a high chair.  If you have a kid who needs a high chair, I would probably bring your own food for him/her.  The high chair that they brought was a bit disgusting. They obviously do not clean their high chairs every night. We were one of the first when they opened so it's not like tons of other kids used it before we got there.  Also the choices are few and far between for a one year old. There are no waffles, pancakes, or anything of that sort.WIth that being said, my quiche was tasty and was accompanied by a lovely side salad.  The coconut banana bread was also very yummy, not too sweet and not too coconutty.  My husband ordered the crab extravaganza - crab benedict, crab cakes, and some other crab item.  All were tasty.Our waiter was a bit stand-offish. I speak french but decided to speak english here and I felt like I paid for it. The waiter was unaccomodating, didn't smile, and ignored us.  We had to wave him down everytime we needed something. It's unfortunate. There was another waiter who stopped by to say hello to my daughter who was very sweet so I don't think all of their staff is half-bad.I would go back for sure...for the food and when my daughter is older!"

I did find the interior pleasing to the eye, and in some ways, it reminded me of a NYC cafe (white walls, soaring ceilings, original wood floors below).

We found numerous places for OK dining, but definitely the area you want to keep to is Old Montreal. This is where you get all things old and new and they meet right in the most unlikely of places. Somewhat hidden away from the grandness that is Old Montreal and off to a bit off a busier street is this place, Le Cartet. If I hadn't had my trusty iPhone indicating where I was versus where the restaurant was, i would never have found it on such a grand street. McGill Rue is a wide street with shops and restaurants. It's a street that leads directly to the Old Port. As soon as we walked in, I was comforted in the thought that we had stumbled onto a fabulous little breakfast joint. Up until then, we were at a kind of hit-or-miss with breakfast, so i was a bit uneasy that this might turn out badly, but I was delighted when i stepped inside. It's a nicely modern establishment with some rustic touches to the decor.  The menu is expansive and the portions are generous. My breakfast was marvelous indeed. I had le Brunch Sucre. And if that name is any indication, yes it was very sweet! I devoured the entire meal. It had everything from Crepes and fruit to French Toast. It was delicious!

So are the clients. Their clients are: 25% business people working around old-port, 35% Artists working in the area, 20% some tourists, 20% residence. - Yet another + for this place is they have a bar area behind cashier, where you can buy organic food, exotic products, lunch in boxes, illy coffee. - In the morning till noon, they have illy coffee for 2.5$. Points card, where you can collect points (10 coffee to get 1 for free)- Brunch for weekdays is 7am-11am; After that, they have lunch. Weekends from 9am to 3pm.

It's not terrible, but at best, it's average (slightly better than average on a few items such as their baked beans, salmon cake, and smoked salmon bagel). The eggs were either too dry or extraordinarily soggy (waterlogged), while the toast consistently came out burnt (almost to a crisp - and not only for us, but also for the patrons around us). Our server didn't seem to notice the char that was supposed to be our toast, in fact, besides taking our order, he didn't speak at all. It was the busboy who inquired if things were okay, and offered to ask the kitchen to change the toast (we declined, as we had finished). The smoothie was quite watered down, and not what you'd expect from a 'supposedly' chic place, although the hot chocolate was not too shabby.

They also do a pretty killer brunch and a decent sit-down lunch. In summer they have a few tables on the McGill sidewalk."

I on the other hand had my mouth water over their Banana Coconut (french) Toast with Yogurt and fruit.  It looked good when it came (~5min after my friends dish), however the top toast was lukewarm and the bottom refridgerator cold bananas throughout the cold toast.  I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she apologized and took it away.  Only to return a few minutes later with the Same one I tried before, now pipping hot and soggy ~ I suspected microwave- and asked if that was the case. She said no, but  they would now make me a fresh one.  Surprised that didn't happen initially.  Much to my surprise, a ""fresh"" one arrived burnt! not just a little either...  Done with sending it back I ate around the most burnt pieces.  Coconut torched is not the most pleasant taste.  Maybe this was an anomaly, but surprised that this was my experience.  The good thing is that the waitress was very friendly and nice- but the kitchen was off for my dish."

Basically everything on the menu is delicious. We tried the Torta mixta, the eggs with goat cheese, the hazelnut toasts with applesauce and everything was delicious, not to mention their coffee, croissants, duck rillette and bacon. Also a great place to go with kids, because of how fast they are to serve and the service is Excellent! Sure going to miss this place when i go back home!"

/user_details?userid=D5SZz60_r-MN-8fJGj3axA,Constance S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is our long-standing first choice for a brunch with great value. By value, I mean the quality for the price. Yes, there are fancier brunches to be had, but when we're hungry and don't want to take any chances, Le Cartet is it. My husband gets the ""des Cantons"" brunch and I get the ""Sante"" brunch. The fresh OJ is much better in the warm months -- it's a bit too tart in the cold months. Usually there's lots of fresh fruit, but they didn't include that when we went in December 2013 -- why? :(. I also like to pick up some chocolate from their huge selection when we check out. We know when to arrive so we don't have to wait in a queue (before 11), and they generally have enough wait staff that service is good. When I worked in downtown Montreal, I often had lunch here or bought a to-go lunch and dessert. We like the spacious high ceilings and the basic decor. One reviewer from TO said it was sooooo passe, but having lived in Montreal for 7 years, and for 30+ years in the US, and some years in TO, I've seen that nothing is more fickle and silly than the Toronto foodie scene. Honestly, any place that would welcome Momofuku like it was the hottest thing ever is plain daft. Anyway, I can testify that Le Cartet has been solid and inviting for at least a decade, and is more inviting since the remodel. I hope it stays that way for another decade. because we'll continue to make it our destination."

/user_details?userid=qwxRERvEvMyl24o4MV857g,Crissa L.,"Millcreek, Salt Lake City, UT",2 star rating,"Meant to eat breakfast here, but didn't get there until breakfast had finished (although the signs all seemed to say we had another hour before breakfast closed...).  I'm guessing the breakfast would still be great, but the lunch was really disappointing.  It wasn't bad per se, but wasn't better than anything I make in my own kitchen (I got the ham and cheese sandwich - very boring, my husband got an overpriced quiche that was very similar and not better than one I make at home).  Coffee was fantastic though, and the ambiance was pretty cool.  Wait staff seemed annoyed at our existence, and although we're annoying, I don't think we gave them enough to know that.  Overall, maybe it's as good as they say for breakfast, but I would definitely say skip this one for lunch."

/user_details?userid=M6MuRc__Us13CqfFZL6xww,Vic S.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Looks kind of trendy. French trendy. Meaning very small tables located so closely to each other that you cannot really talk (unless you are a fan of ""weather talk""). Brunch is quite good presented. But there is nothing to eat, even though the plate looks big. 16$ for a croissant with ham and cheese and some salad and a ""mimosa"" (orange juice with a drop of some sparkling wine in it) for 5$? Not going there again for sure. I don't mind paying good money for good food, but this is not good food by any reasonable standards."
