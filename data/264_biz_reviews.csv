After ordering takeout/delivery 3 times, I think I've found my new go-to sushi spot. Though I had some issues with deliveries (twice), they rectified the situation and had consistently good customer service. The sushi is fresh, well-priced and original. They have great deals for platters so I look forward to ordering them once we can get together with friends again. Yum!"

The tuna had a great texture, the rice was perfectly seasoned and the spicy tuna had more flavor and kick than the generic sauce I normally encounter. Went ""wild"" and ordered the Phily Chicken (46a) to try one of the new fads, and DAMN those were tasty bites. Free delivery directly from their website so skip Uber Eats and give them all your money!!"

This place is super affordable and the quality is very high. The staff are all friendly and the sushi is even better. I find that the taste is much better than other fast-food type sushi restaurants in that the fish tastes super fresh and seems to be of high quality. Also, as far as the poke bowls go, each piece of fish is not the same size, meaning that they likely cut each piece fresh every time. As for their rolls, they are delicious. Perfectly shaped and cut, they all come with delicious dipping sauces. Overall, very satisfied with this place and will be ordering again in the future!"

This is a must I'm if you are in the CDN area - they offer free delivery. My favorite rolls were by far Yazuka, Joker, champion, Atlantis and Sirène. Fresh and so much fish in the rolls. The prices just melt in tour mouth. Very impressed with their customer service and the quality of the food. It's my second time ordering and I'll be back very soon."
