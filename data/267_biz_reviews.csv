The wait staff were attentive and knowledgeable.  The risotto was amazing with the Parmesan foam. The beef tartare is perfections.  Although, I was not a fan of the butternut squash dessert - the chocolate lava cake is the way to go."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When you feel like luxury, but not necessarily going to a hot spot, this is the place for you. My wife took me here for a birthday lunch and the entire experience was awesome.We started at the bar which was ideal for people watching. Within a span of 15 minutes, I got into 2 expertly prepared Vesper Martinis with a twist of orange. They were spectacular. I'd go back to the bar just for this drink. I got to see a dejected older man being scolded by his disinterested trophy wife, followed by her staring at her phone for 10 minutes straight without a single word exchanged between them. Both of them looked f!@#ing miserable. Who says money buys happiness? I also noticed what looked like a pimp with a gaggle of young women off in the corner ordering some rare bottles of wine. You've got a couple of businessmen to my left ordering Old Fashioneds. One of them asks the bartender why his drink doesn't have a cherry in it. She tells him that he's thinking of a Manhattan, but if he needs a cherry, one will be provided for him.Eventually, we moved to a table in the bright covered terasse overlooking the garden. Brian Mulroney walks by, and is greeted by the waiter ""Hello Mr Prime Minister"" The guy at the table across from us is wearing a baseball cap. Another table of country club types look like they belong in a Brooks Brothers catalogue or a commercial for cholesterol medication. Ultimately, the restaurant is a mix between people treating themselves to something special, and others who have long ceased being impressed by the nice things in life.I started with the Iberico Ham appetizer which comes at a price tag of a whopping 46$ (it was my birthday after all......) Unfortunately, the meat was sliced into tiny little squares and lacked any of the rich taste you would find at Ibericos on St. Denis or Pied de Cochon on Duluth. That's fine though. Sipping my funky orange wine, I was feeling NO PAIN. Add to that one heck of an epic bread basket and butter, life was good. Then came the burger that Lesley Chesterman ranked in her top 10. I wholly agree. It's one tasty burger. I would have preferred a slightly thicker patty, however. Purely on taste, I'll take the 7 dollar burger at Burger de Ville any day over that of the Ritz. Nevertheless, for 31$, you get the atmosphere and the experience.For dessert, I decided to get the cheese plate, which was tasty but underwhelming in it's portion. For my birthday, they also presented me with a basket of freshly baked madeleines which were seriously addictive.For a moment, I can fantasize about becoming a regular here, living upstairs and spending money with a bored look on my face. On second thought, it's the perspective of everyday life that makes an occasional splurge at a place like Maison Boulud fun."

Everything about the establishment was beautiful, and the service was top-notch (honestly expected nothing less). Opted for the pre-fixe menu, and thoroughly enjoyed the choices and every single dish that came out. I definitely recommend it since you get a pretty comprehensive experience out of it. Just make sure to allot about two hours for it. The cocktails were also really good, so don't forget to grab a drink while you're there!"

From the moment I walked in, service is on you- I checked in my coat and was walked to my table. For a Sunday evening, we got lucky to be seated next to the garden -the view is beautiful. With soft music playing in the background you'll be greeted by your server. I was there trying the mushroom menu (the menu rotates weekly). I ordered the 75$ tasting that includes a selection of 4-5 appetizers, choice of one main and a set dessert. With a shared bottle of wine for 3, tax and tip- it came to around 130$ pp. Before each course, the server took their time to explain each item. Presentation was beautiful and portions were perfect. I hope to come back to this lovely elegant piece of Montreal soon!"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For our anniversary, the hubby surprised me to a fancy gourmet 3-course brunch at Maison Boulud. Stepping inside, I would have never expected such gorgeous interior and luxury hidden away in downtown Montreal's Golden Square Mile - it really felt like walking into somewhere in London's Mayfair. We were seated on the patio which was flooded with natural light and a spectacular view of the beautiful Ritz garden. The ambiance is romantic and tranquil, almost as if the hustle and bustle of the city is non-existent. The season's menu was presented to us, which changes as it is influenced by the seasonal bounties from Quebec and uses local ingredients. Despite there not being many vegetarian options, we still found it difficult deciding on our choices. For the first course, I enjoyed the Organic Beets, Monnoir Cheese, Pistachio, Wild Caraway starter which was light and full of flavour, awakening the taste buds to what would come next.I opted for the Spinach and Cheddar Stuffed Croissant for my main course; though it does not sound as unique and exciting as the other options, I can honestly say that this was the BEST breakfast croissant that I have ever had. Every bite was full of flavour and so filling; pastry lovers - this is the one for you. The husband had Eggs Benedict with Chanterelles Mushrooms and he was definitely more than satisfied with his choice. The level of presentation definitely matched the taste, we were both in heaven.Finally, for my favourite course (dessert) this was by far, the most difficult to choose from. With so many unique pairings, it was hard to bring it down to just one selection. I decided on the Quebec Strawberry Clafoutis served with Sweet Clover Mousse, Blackberries and Vanilla Ice Cream; by far, this was the best course and in my opinion, the best selection too. Breaking into the sweet mousse to discover the delightful berry filling was a such a treat; alongside the buttery clafoutis, each bite was heavenly and bursting with flavour and freshness. Hubby had Olive Oil candied Apricots with Vanilla Mousse, Saffron and Sorbet - the menu barely gives any indication as to what to expect, so to see it presented as a dark chocolate dessert surrounded by pieces of saffron jelly and candied apricots was a magnificent surprise! Presentation truly is immaculate, we loved the extra touches of candles and chocolate wordings on our plates. By its fine interior, the Ritz Carlton definitely lived up to its reputation and legendary chef Daniel Boulud lived up to his name. With such top class service and speciality crafted brunch, Maison Boulud truly is a 5-star culinary experience!"

Naturally I wanted to check the property out because I am Marriott Ambassador and love the brand.The Maison Boulud is connected to the hotel and my Uber driver raved about their outdoor seating area the night before which intrigued my wife. We ordered a three course meal and shared it. It was definitely enough for two people. I had a bottle sparking water as well.First off the outdoor seating area is absolutely beautiful! If the weather is nice you forsure want to sit outside, It was June 30th ( summatime) and the weather was perfect. Food was spectacular as expected ( very pricy) and the service was too notch.I give this place two  's up"

We got Foie gras as an appetizer, which had a jelly layer and pieces of sponge cake on top. I ve tried foie gras many times in the past, nothing close this this, simply amazing.John Dory fish entre was a white breaded fish with small pieces of roasted cauliflower and broccoli with light flavorful sauce spread over it. Onglet - hanger steak was perfectly cooked and served with a delicious thin gravy sauce on the side. Dessert was a heaven- we tried hazelnut cake and maple ice cream dessert, cant recall the exact names, both were just to die for. The wine selection was also very good both  by the glass or bottle. I tried red meinklung blaufrankisch and it turned out to be a good discovery."
/user_details?userid=dqJLYI-jhOCAQt-ozeQ03g,Erin F.,"Ithaca, NY",5 star rating,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Maison Boulud. The service was wonderful, and the food and drinks were excellent. We had the razor clams appetizer, the nimbus and grande madame cocktails,  a few glasses of wine, the scallop entree and the steak entree with potatoes and vegetables as a side, and the lava cake for dessert, and all exceeded our expectations. The bread was delicious as well, and we appreciated the gift from the chef we were given after dessert. It may be worth noting that the menu wasn't exactly as it appeared online (the lamb we saw online was replaced with another option on the menu at the restaurant). The atmosphere was lovely as well, and I'd certainly recommend this restaurant for a special night out."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Boulud needs no introduction and this review is just to validate that it is in fact worth the price. This is the most extravagant meal I've ever eaten. My friends and I did the 8 course tasting menu with wine pairing and I don't even know where to begin.Each dish was better than the next. There was a lot of fish and seasonal ingredients which I really enjoyed. With each service, the sommelier poured us our wine pairing and took a couple of minutes to explain to us her selection. I loved the variety of drinks that we were brought! We started with a champagne, then a white wine, a sake, an orange wine and finally a red wine. Our meal consisted of:-amuse bouche-octopus and scallop crude with a jus-snow crab and avocado with a yuzu sauce and salty rice cracker (this was my favourite dish!)-foie gras with homemade brioche-spaghetti with clams and sea urchin sauce (amazing, my other favourite dish!)-lamb with cauliflower purée and vegetables-cheese dish made of a quebec cheese on a cracker with poached pears covered with shaved cheese-dessert were 2 deconstructed apples. One had poached apples with chantilly and the other a sorbet inside!-we also had mignardises with coffee. They brought a selection of sablés, chocolate truffles and apple jelly squares.It truly was a very special experience and one that I will not forget it!"
/user_details?userid=lv5TnHGfrSb_CIisOw0irg,Jay K.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"This is a brunch review, and I usually hate reading brunch reviews as they don't tell you very much about a restaurant like this, so I'll keep it short.Bottom line is that I wouldn't be reviewing Maison Boulud's brunch if it was not extraordinary, and it most certainly is. From the serene environment (an idyllic duck pond, a lush garden, objets d'art galore) to the impeccably respectful and knowledgeable service staff to (most importantly) the food, this was a meal that needed to be written about.The ""Saumon Fumé Maison Et Oeuf Au Plat"" consisted of a mound of smoked salmon, a sunny-side up egg set on top of potato latkes, and a dollop of crème fraiche with dill, red onions, and capers. There's nothing revolutionary with this dish except that every single component was perfectly cooked, cut, or otherwise prepared. Do you like your crème fraiche to taste like otherworldly onion butter? Then this is for you, as it was for me. They could have stopped here and still earned 5 stars, but it got even better.The ""Homard en Brioche"" (Lobster Roll) used an especially eggy brioche roll set against a surprisingly spicy fresh lobster salad with crisp cucumbers and celery - with the heat coming from pickled red radishes. Dressed to the 9s with seasoned frisée lettuce tossed in oil, it was evident that whoever conceived this dish is in love with the kind of lobster rolls served in toasted hot dog buns at seaside New England clam shacks, but saw opportunities to tweak them in an effective way that enhances rather than subverts.My brunch ended with the ""Forêt Noir,"" a black forest chocolate génoise with chocolate mousse, cherries in kirsch, chantilly cream, vanilla ice cream, and sprinkled with flakes of gold. A sad and sobering send-off, as I realized while eating it that it will be months, if not years, before I make it back to Montréal from San Diego for my next meal at Maison Boulud.Food/Décor/Service: 4.6/4.9/4.7What To Order: Homard en Brioche (Lobster Roll), Saumon Fumé Maison Et Oeuf Au Plat (Smoked Salmon, Latkes, Egg)"

It's located in the gorgeous Ritz. Ask for the patio seating. It's absolutely breathtaking with the bright natural sunlight and freshly fallen snow.I'd definitely recommend coming hungry and indulging in the three course brunch. The mimosas are perfectly fizzy and I love the pulpy freshly squeezed OJ they use. The complimentary warm bread to start is incredible. What's even better? The rich butter it comes with! The chicken liver pate and smoked salmon were both hits. The lobster Benedict was worth every extra CAD. The desserts were incredible - the waffles were properly leavened and served with the most delicious vanilla whipped cream and of course, maple syrup!The waitstaff is incredibly kind and personable.

/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Maison Boulud lives up to its​ namesake icon. With our culinary legends dropping off the face of the planet these days at the same rate as musicians I have started to make it a point to visit as many Michelin rated Chef outposts as possible while I can. With Joël no longer with us, most would argue​ Daniel Boulud is now the North American ambassador of French and in a city with a name such as Montréal, there was zero chance that I would not visit. What is interesting​ about Maison Boulud would have escaped me had I not consulted with Canada's own legend of Yelp - Soleil S. - before my visit. Apparently,​ Boulud was forced to do an about-face​ on his business model we are accustomed to in the States as the local economy started to lose traction. With that,​ the menu transitioned​ from Classic French to a more accessible hybrid that does not shake the wallet so hard. The bill will still sting a bit, however. Having been to several other Boulud forums, this actually​ made the stop all the more special. The ​menu is driven by Québec's regional​ purveyors and you will discover​ specialties from Boulud's New York City restaurants, including Lyonnais Charcuterie, Acorn Fed Senorio Iberico Ham, and even some casual items you would never have thought possible such as Burgers & Pasta dishes - and of course - several plates you can only find in Montréal.Case in point would have to be Maison Boulud's Croque-Monsieur which takes a rather humble French Sandwich into the stratosphere​ with the use of superlative ingredients. I know it has been done before (Tom Keller's Bouchon comes to mind) but not quite to these heights. Two​ pieces of bakery fresh Pullman loaf Bread is loaded inside and out with ​healthy heaps of Curé Hebert Cheese which gives the dish a smooth, velvety​ texture that is comparable​ to custard along with a nutty flavor that contrasts perfectly with the generous​ thinly shaved Ham. Speaking about the Ham, being a Boulud recipe it cannot just be pasture raised, grass-fed​ Jambon de Paris. No, no, no. Nothing less than Suckling Pig will do. Easily the best Croque-Monsieur I have ever had. By a long shot. Add in the tony locale inside the Ritz Carlton on Montréal's Golden Mile, an interior that would be at home in Paris or New York City, and a polished service game and you have a 5-star rating for the masses. This is a notch you want on the culinary belt."

The place is absolutely incredible, it feels like you have entered a world of perfect luxury.The service was incredible, the moment you step in, everything so far worthy of 5 stars.The food was perfect (main course) and actually bad (starter)I got the blue fin tuna carpaccio to start. I'm not an expert and don't claim to be, but I have tasted lots of amazing fresh fish. This blue fin tuna tasted VERY fishy, so much that I'm typing this an hour after I've come home from the restaurant and still taste fish in my mouth.For the main course I got  pigeon done three ways; roasted, pate, and foie gras.

I haven't tried their brunch yet, nor lunch, but dinner was spectacular.We took the tasting menu, and tried everything on there (we shared).I realized in these restaurants (we also went to Marcus and loved it), that you should always order the vegetarian plates because they are OUTSTANDING in these places.The ravioli of the night was vegetarian, we never would have taken it, it was ""forced"" upon us as a menu item, but it was our favourite dish. Incredible, incredible food.The rest was equally as good. The only downside if any was the salmon, mostly because I think I don't really enjoy black chickpeas or chickpeas in general, and I didn't really like the overall flavour of the dish. It was all beautifully prepared but I don't like those flavours as much.Well priced too, considering the quality, and we even got free little amuse bouches and ending to the dinners. It was calm, relaxing, not too loud, warm, and an excellent dining experience.I am definitely coming back here."

We went for the tasting menu on a hot Friday night and scored a table on the patio. It was wonderful. First we thought about the wine pairing. Then we thought, six glasses with eight courses is a lot. Then I wondered how I can pick wine when I don't know what's coming. The waitress and sommelier were wonderful. They suggested wines by the glass that would hold up for at least two upcoming courses. Not all choices hit my preferences perfectly, but they all worked. I just have strange preferences. On the surprise menu, I made clear that there are few ingredients that I do not like - and one is in season - but not for me please. No problem. They checked with the kitchen and concluded that an adaptation to my preferences is no problem. I don't have a reference, but it was heavenly. Foie gras terrine, sashimi (I think fluke) wit radish, spaghetti vongole, lamb, and various desserts is all I can recall, but there were more than eight. Now we need to send the staff of Bar Boulud Boston to Maison Boulud Montreal for training! Why does Boston get neglected?"

Good date spot I must say.The waiter was kind and super knowledgeable. He was sweet and smiley. I wish I could've caught his name to thank him properly. This place is definitely a spot where you do not want to look like Joe Shmo. You would stick out like a soar thumb. Instead put some lipstick and heels on (only if you wanna) and strut your stuff...besides it's always fun to dress up and make an effort once and a while.

It is probably the best restaurant in montreal. I'm not afraid to say it. The decor is simply spectacular and fancy. Even the chairs are massive and confortable. Service is personal, cordial, attentionate and perfectly executed. Standards are very high and impeccable.My entrée was a plate of guinea hen filled cavatellini pasta that were so tasteful. The bouillon had so much flavor I wanted to drink it by itself forever. I have some decency in public so I took a bread to get the very last drops of it but it was that good.Next was the beef tenderloin with potatoes, spinach, bone marrow and bordelaise sauce which seemed quite simple at first but it was the best, most tender and perfectly cooked tenderloin I have ever eaten. After talking with some of staff we were told that there was never any plate returned for unprecise cooking and I have no problem believing it. We were 14 people and every single dish was impeccable.To finish on another good note. We had a plate of cheese with curé-hébert and aged comté. I was full and ate the whole thing like my life depended on it. I will wait with impatience and pleasure for the moment I can return to maison boulud."

The service is amazing! My boyfriend and I started with a glass of bubbly each. At first I wanted a glass of rosé bubbly so they opened a magnum bottle for just one glass!!  That's nuts! So I tasted mine and tried the bubbly that my boyfriend picked and I preferred his. The waitress could tell and she said she could take the rosé bubbly back. I was hesitant but the waitress said that it was no problem so I changed it for regular champagne instead. I felt so bad but she  didn't seem to mind. Then the sommelier helped us pick a good red wine that we ended up liking a lot that was in our budget. He seemed to really know his stuff. We got the Barra (Cabernet Sauvignon).The waitress gave us these two small cheese bread rolls. They tasted like ritz crackers but in a bread format. They also gave us olive bread and cut baguette. We shared the lobster gnocchi to start. It could also be a main. This was the highlight of the night. That sauce was finger licking good! I was taking the olive bread and dipping it in what was left of the sauce. For mains we shared the beef duo and the lamb. Both were delicious but I think next time I would get the pasta because that lobster gnocchi really blew  my mind. The beef duo consisted of two rectangular pieces of steak and one square roast beef. Out of the two types of beef I preferred the roast beef. The lamb was very tasty. It came with eggplant, kale and mushrooms. The dessert was absolutely delicious! We got the chocolate coulant with salted caramel ice cream. As an extra they gave us these little bite sized desserts and they gave us a small jar of hazelnut chocolate to bring home. I haven't opened it yet but I imagine it's like homemade Nutella. It's pricey so it's not your everyday restaurant but I definitely recommend it for special events."

Maison Boulud, from Chef Daniel Boulud, really made a lasting impression on me. We had an 8pm reservation, and were seated out on the patio overlooking the pond area - really cute!The tasting menu is 6 courses, and the chef takes in any dietary restrictions/dislikes and sends out the courses. There is no set menu. We came in pretty hungry, and I did worry that we might leave hungry - but we left so stuffed! Some of my favorite dishes was the handmade gnocchi with lobster, the arancini amuse bouche, and the tuna tataki with clams. We also had several desserts - chocolate souffle was delicious and so was the passionfruit tartlets!Service was truly excellent. Our meal took about 3 hours so you definitely just sit and eat and get full to the max. We couldn't even finish our desserts! Beautiful hotel and space, would definitely recommend!"

The fall menu had just arrived so there are more comfort food items to choose from as the weather cools.  As an entree I took the razor clam, dungeness crab and sea urchin plate. It was dabbled with dashi gelée and an avocado roll with shima aji. Wow! Light and fresh. Also tried the terrine de foie gras which was surprisingly light as well but still rich. Accompanied by a Pinot noir it went down very easy.  For the main meal I had the homemade pasta with lamb shoulder. This is comfort food at its finest. Braised vegetables and fall off the bone meat I was in heaven. My partner had the potato gnocchi with lobster. I found the lobster perfectly cooked but an odd contrast with gnocchi. The sauce that was poured on it was an elegant maitake mushroom,leek an coral emulsion that on its own would have been a soup I'd pay for. I spooned every last drop. So elegant and flavours you've never tasted married together before.  You can't resist desert at Maison Boulud... we tried the chocolate salted caramel lava cake that was so rich, I couldn't finish it. I tried! The other desert was a light strawberry pistachio limoncello baba with a scoop of basil sorbet that was to die for.  Obviously you can't eat here everyday unless you're super wealthy, but for a special occasion, you must try it. The bill for 2 is half a G, but I'm not complaining... I'm just sad I can't eat here once a week."

I put my fork and knife down, contemplated the meaning of life before deciding if I really wanted to continue eating and finish the food. It was excellence.

One of the best service you'll get in the city. Super attentive service. I was more impressed by supper than brunch because I was hungry very shortly after brunch even though I ate a steak. Yes I know, who eats a steak for brunch? Well, me! It's on the menu so somebody has to eat it. I had a steak for supper, it was perfect so I went for more at brunch. Everything I had at this place was succulent. I like to eat in the garden, it's zen and beautiful. I didn't have their tasting menu yet but hopefully I'll get to try it soon. Obviously the place is pricey since its signed Boulud. If you want to spoil a very special someone , it's the place to be."

The food was excellent. The service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was chic and upscale with a touch of old Hollywood glamour. The decor was gorgeous and worthy of being in the Ritz. On a hot summer day, the patio in the garden is an oasis. The food here is vibrant and innovative. The use of fresh ingredients and the playing of delicious flavours makes Maison Boulud a technical tour de force. One of the standout dishes was the sea urchin with a light foam. It was decadent. The prices are reasonable given the quality of the dishes. The prices are in line with similar high end restaurants. I would highly recommend Maison Boulud."

My expectations were exceeded! Loved, loved everything about this well reknowned resto and it deserves 5 star rating! Let's begin with the resto ambiance..as soon as you walk into this resto you are greeted by a super friendly hostess with a great big smile! The decor is absolutely stunning and glamourous creating a warm welcoming feeling. The moment you walk in , you get a sense of being transported away! At the end of the resto is the stupendous beautifully glass covered veranda overlooking the beautiful garden and pond. Nothing like having breakfast in a beautiful glass veranda creating a zen-like feeling. Onto the food, wow ...we tried the pain perdu and egg's benedict dishes as well as a side order of smoked home and basket of four warmly baked goodies croissant, chocolatine, raspberry tartelette ....every bite just melted in your mouth. Yes the prices for some of these breakfast dishes are quite expensive but they really worth it!!  This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary, wedding proposal, birthday milestone or a girls weekend outing! I recommend trying this out at least once in a lifetime! The resto is adjacent to the luxiourious Ritz Carlton hotel! You can walk into the lobby for a sneak peek! The egg's benedict were not like any egg's benedict...the hollandaise sauce was light and delicious! Yummy!  Reservations are a must!  Simply amazing foodie experience! Check out my pictures."

Being connected to the Ritz Carlton helps with it's curb appeal, but once inside, the decor seems old fashioned. Greeted by a friendly staff, you feel the effort to create the sense of importance and class. The food overall is better than average but for the price point, I've had much more memorable experiences (Scramouche in Toronto, for example). Unfortunately, we had a couple of minor issues where the staff had offered to send their in house sommelier to explain the residue on the bottom of my wine glass. They never came.Overall, I'm giving a 3* because, as a high end restaurant, I expected a bit more. I will gladly revisit to give it another go in the future."

/user_details?userid=TG0pDlxK33DJofeW0JketQ,Jas S.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Yes, probably 3.5 stars.  Why?  Simple - lack of value.  Ok, it's a high-end place so you're not supposed to complain about the price and have low expectations - after all you're in the Ritz Carlton.  $68 Ribeye should be charred perfectly, thick cut of beef, served hot - it wasn't (oh needed salt too).  4 fried artichokes hearts for $19 lacked a bit of acid to offset the aioli.  Duck with foie gras was well prepared but not served hot and needed salt.  The chocolate lava cake was good as were the apples, but again these were not out of this world $20 desserts (hoped for a souffle?)  Caviar choices were plentiful, but not a truffle to be found.  Our $115 bottle of wine we pretty much poured ourselves.  The wine list is extensive and the som was knowledgable, we enjoyed our super Tuscan even if he tried to sell us mediocre Canadian wine (getting a kickback I assume).  Our favorite was the bread.  The beignets (served with the burrata) and focaccia were our favorite item of the meal.  My ceviche was creative and had great flavors.  Presentation of dishes was spectacular.    So you will have a good meal here and will pay a lot for it.  While there are so many other choices for French food, I know with a bit more focus and effort, Maison Boulud could (return?) be a true 5 stars."

My parents and I went here for Saturday brunch which turned out to be one of our best decisions of our trip to Montreal. The service was sublime, waiter was kind, beaming with a smile and the servers were exceptionally well-trained so that our glasses were never empty for more than a brief moment. We were lucky enough to sit outside to enjoy the wonderful weather. You could tell the serving staff were aware of every thing happening at the table and they accomplished that without being overbearing. The food was also superb. I had the head cheese - a dish I have never had before and I am thankful that this was my introduction to its unique deliciousness - then the Icelandic Cod, which was perfectly seared and lightly seasoned. For dessert the tarte tatin was an interesting and highly sucessful interpretation of the traditional dish. It was the perfect amount of food for brunch and I left without having to adjust my belt an extra notch. Amazing experience and highly recommended."

Well I guess if you're the Ritz Carlton you wouldn't settle for a restaurant that didn't make Canada's top 100 list. Let alone, anything below the nb 27th spot held by La Maison Boulud!Namesake restaurant after Michelin star renowned chef Daniel Boulud, this place is probably the epitome of fine dining in Montreal... well at least from my experiences ;)Every dish is a work of art in not only presentation but in complexity of flavour. There is not a single drop of sauce that goes unnoticed for the depth of flavour it adds to the dish as a whole. That little dot of brown sauce in the lobster bisque? It's actually a reduction of mushrooms that adds an earthy element to a seafood flavoured dish. That hint of yellow you get underneath the parmesan emulsion? Yes, there is indeed lemon zest that freshens everything up.From the moment you walk in and get seated by the stunning model like hostess to the one where the waiter expertly recommends and paces your food to finally the one where you let that perfectly creamy burrata melt in your mouth ... you'll really feel like you've just experienced what Montreal and the historically luxurious Ritz had to offer in terms of the finer things in life.Granted, with finer things do come along a more pricier tag, but from time to time it's worth the splurge and La Maison Boulud falls into that category :)"

Unfortunately, the foie gras course was inedible to me and others at my table.  Several of us just ate a bite or two.  Now granted I am not a huge foie gras fan, but at this level of restaurant, I don't ever expect to gag at the table, which I did.  I would have also expected the staff to ask me if there was a problem.  Which I didn't get so unfortunate.Other courses were delivered at the high level service you would expect of this place.  For the price the over experience was sub par."

The visit did not disappoint; it was an all-around great experience. We were seated in the sun room overlooking the back courtyard. Snow had fallen all day and continued to fall during the meal so the evening had a tranquil cast to it. The room was separated from the rest of the restaurant; comfortable wood chairs and large tables populated this room with a casualness that reminded me of a ski chalet.As entrée, I had duck breast, a large portion, medium rare, served as large chunks with radicchio. The duck skin was crisp and crackled. It was perfect. Separately, we shared the potatoes (German Butterball) with truffles. Cooked to perfect consistency, the savory potatoes were garlicky well-seasoned, nutty, and delicious. We scraped ever last bit of the dish into our tummies. It was possibly the best potatoes I have ever had; the dish inspired me to improve my own version. I intend to purchase Chef Boulud's recently-released cookbook for other inspirations.Dessert was a chocolate/hazelnut crunch and separately, limoncello sorbet. I loved the two flavors together and am glad that it was a departure from the chocolate/raspberry combination offered at most places. Structural sugar element added taste, dimension (and wow) to the meal.Service was impeccable. Reminded me of the level of service received at Commander's Palace many, many moons ago. The waitstaff synchronized the delivery of the meal so that all the plates touched the table at the same time. It was like a waltz. I saw pride in their delivery; they knew that small details impress and make a lasting impression."

I got a seat at the bar and I must say, they were the most comfortable bar stools I have ever encountered. The atmosphere was intimate and luxe. The bartender was very friendly and helped me pick out a wine to enjoy as I am not that familiar with European wines. I was not wanting anything particularly heavy before bed but apparently heavy food is all you'll get here. I sort of let this affect my overall rating but only because I felt that some items were a bit misleading.I got the herb salad and the half order of the gnocchi. The herb salad was delicious but the entire bottom of the salad was thick, creamy cheese. It was good but there was more cheese than salad! There was also an egg of some sort, I am guessing quail. The gnocchi was delicious but the ""coral emulsion"" is a very heavy cream sauce. For just those two items and two glasses of wine, my total was over $100. I know people don't go to a restaurant like this to dine cheaply but I guess I just felt that what I ate wasn't that amazing. It was tasty but definitely not something I'd rave about."

The Mimosas made the experience divine. Service was swift and everyone very accommodating. If you're feeling fancy after you've checked out of the Ritz, Boulud might fit your bill. However, it would probably be better to take an Uber to one of the many little bistros that this beautiful city has to offer.  Would I come back for a $200 brunch for 3?

I must admit I was nervous about venison but really liked trying some of the meat. -short ribs with sweet bread... I was never a fan of sweet breat - the thought of thymus or pancreas was just too unappetizing and the flavor was never good enough to keep me from thinking, ""I'm eating thymus.""  But Maison Bouloud has changed me into a sweetbread lover - perfectly seasoned and cooked that I actually ate the large piece on the plate and wanted more.  -My husband reported his sea urchin dish was okay - flavor was overpowering of fish so some people would probably really like this.  -dessert - beautiful creations of ""stained-glass"" candy on cream with tiny crisp meringues and fruit.  Not too heavy, which was perfect for a very filling foodie meal.  My husband was actually stuffed!Beautiful contemporary ambiance in the Ritz Carlton."

It was a convenient option for me while I was staying in Montreal (nice when the restaurant is in the hotel!). I ordered a rigatoni pasta with alfredo sauce. It was pretty good and I was told the pasta was made fresh which is always a highlight - but oddly I don't think it tasted much different from pre-made pasta. The sauce was quite good but really buttery (make no mistake - I love butter, but twenty minutes into eating my dish I felt the once liquidy sauce started to solidify and at that point it tasted almost exclusively of butter). I felt the dish was missing something - chicken, vegetables perchance? Something to elevate it from simply pasta with a sauce. What I am seeing from the rest of the reviews is that Boulud's protein dishes are divine - which makes me think that next time a burger or a steak if where I should venture. The pictures of the beautifully-presented desserts also look enticing. Given I had a decent experience the first time at Boulud, I'm open to giving it another chance. Until next time, Maison Boulud!"

I booked Boulud for my partner and I's anniversary last Saturday evening. It was my third time frequenting Boulud. In the past I had very lovely dining experiences here. This experience, however, left me completely perplexed and underwhelmed by the quality of service and ambiance. First off, we were seated on their terrasse area - however because it is autumn, it was cold. We were seated in a corner, which was surrounded by a white nylon tarp/tent and awful bright LED strip lighting. This was very underwhelming setting for a restaurant of this caliber. It felt like high end food served in a hotel lobby, quite touristy. Next was the service, which was questionable. The wait staff was snappy, rude and inconsistent. Not helpful. The food was good but due to the overall vibe, we already had a bad taste in our mouths. It felt and looked like a cheap hotel lobby restaurant. Good food does not justify poor ambiance and bad staff. I really wish I had a better experience this time! There are MANY excellent restaurants in Montreal and for the quality of experience I received, I would unfortunately not return back to Boulud."

The food here deserves a solid 5 stars. Monsieur Boulud lives up to his reputation and I have yet to be disappointed by his food. (LOVE Daniel in NY) The presentation, taste and creativity of his food is amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our food here. It was delicious!What I found surprising was the service. We frequent the Ritz(s) back at home - San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, Marina Del Rey, Lake Tahoe and have gotten used to a standard of service that I didn't quite find here in Montreal. We, by no means, had terrible service, but we didn't have great service either. It was the little things...my mimosa was forgotten, my silverware was forgotten so I had to ask for a set after my food arrived, our waters weren't refilled...it was just not something I expected to happen here at the Ritz. On the other hand, the gentleman in the front who fetched our coats for us was great so we at least left on a happy note.The Ritz is beautiful though. Next time, we'll have to come try the champagne bar and afternoon tea.Food:Crispy fried egg with ham and marinated mushrooms - perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the mushrooms and the saltiness of the ham and creaminess and crunchiness of the egg. Really tasty!Greek yogurt and berries - berries were sweet and the yogurt was thick and creamyEggs Benedict - the man friend had no complaints. He doesn't usually like eggs benedict but loved this.Skate wing - beautiful presentation and incredibly tasty. The skate wing was a little bit crispy outside and moist inside. Loved it!!Mini Madeleines - these were sooo good...I couldn't stop eating them. They came out warm with powdered sugar on top. Light and fluffy with a little zing of lemon. Addicting!"

It was great!I ordered the  three course, late night supper menu. The complimentary arancini in squid ink was quite alright: tiny bite sized morsels to whet one's appetite. While the poricini soup was very seasonal, it looked unfortunately, but understandably, muddy brown. I quite enjoyed its earthy yet delicate flavors. I really enjoyed the lamb main course: succulent and tender and paired really well with refreshing, grilled vegetables. I rounded off my meal with a palette enriching cheese plate.The glasses of Chianti I ordered complimented the meal very well.I will admit that different servers bringing different courses felt a bit unnecessary. However, all of them were very polite and engaged me in friendly conversation. At the end of the evening, I was satiated and in a good spirits. I'll be back!"

Mr Moderator, do I get a prize such as a Yelp mug or a medal?! ;)My wife and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at Maison Boulud. At the end of the meal, we both agreed that Maison Boulud is one of, if not the best fine dining restaurant in Montreal. This is grand hotel dining of the highest order.We had outdoor seating and thoroughly enjoyed the urban garden along with the duck pond (I've had an inexplicable fondness for ducks since I was a child). We had the tasting menu, which consisted of 2 appetizers, 1 pasta, 1 fish, 1 meat and 2 desserts. My personal favorites were the cured Japanese snapper appetizer, the Wagyu beef tataki, a lamb dish (quality of the meat was unreal)... and the addictive madeleine at the end of the meal. The service is outstanding, yet not intimidating (as opposed to similar restaurants). The bill was a bit stiff but totally worth it considering the amazing meal we had.

It was my first time at Maison Boulud so I was pretty stoked to try it. Good : The service was exceptional. Honestly, the hospitality is above anything I've experienced, everything from the hostess to waiters is very polite. My glass was constantly refilled, unbelievable good service. The decor was beautiful, we were seated outdoors and the garden was gorgeous (until my mom pointed out 'Look at all those dirty looking buildings behind it!). For appetizers, I've ordered the veal carpaccio and it was delicious. I had the trout as my main, and it was hands down the best fish I've ever had. Basically, every dish I picked was a hit!Bad : Everyone else's food.  My mom ordered a Croissant de Chez Hofkelsten Farci, which is a fancy name for soggy croissant with way too much cheese. My sister had the Ouefs Muerette, which translates to boring eggs benedict in English. My father ordered the DBGB Burger, which he never mentioned if it was good or not. Bottom line: I've sampled their plates as well and concluded that is very subpar for the price. Location is nice, the decor is stunning, but I wasn't blown away by any other dish...except the trout."

/user_details?userid=WC1m2B-bXg1g57AyvzAL-Q,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"This very posh restaurant is located in the Ritz Carlton Montreal. The decor inside is contemporary, trendy, and elegant. There are walls of cut glass squares decorating the main rooms with a large fireplace in the center. My family and I were seated in a dining area that was private, we believe because Daniel in NYC catered my wedding 2 years ago and the recognized our name in their system.  It was a nice touch. We had to wait 10-15 minutes to get any menus but after that the service was impeccable. Our bread was replaced the second we finished it, our water was constantly filled, if our wine was empty more was brought out. There was a special menu for Christmas which had a pretty good variety of options. My husband and I settled on the raviolo for a starter. It was one very marge ravioli filled with cheese and spinach and a poached egg, topped with leeks and mushrooms, in a parmesan foam and pesto sauce. It was pretty flavorful and good but we both agreed we would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker so we could have eaten it more easily with the raviolo. My fathered ordered the mushroom soap with foie gras and he loved it. My ordered the foie gras and also enjoyed it throughly. There was not a vegetarian option on the menu for the entree but they gladly made me a mushroom, tomato, squash pasta with a mushroom cream sauce. It was quite good. My husband got a pasta with duck ragout. He basically inhaled it he loved it so much. My mom got a fish entree and raved Bout it all through dinner and after. My dad got the steak duo and really liked it but had trouble finishing it because it was just a lot of steak. We all shared the four desserts. They were very delicious and incredibly interesting. The sorbets and ice creams were paired perfectly with the flavors of the desserts. This was a very nice meal. The staff was accommodating and very attentive. They were also very knowledgable regarding wines and each dish on the menu. They were constantly seeing if everything was alright with our meal. At the end, we were given a small basket of madeleines which we ended up taking home with us."

I have to give it to French chefs, the experience at this restaurant is so unique that it makes prices irrelevant on the menu. Example, waiter takes order, another person serves basket of bread, another person serves water, dishes are served simultaneously without asking who ordered what, soiled cutlery is removed and new ones brought for every dish, bread basket and water replenished without asking, you basically feal like royalty eating here. I haven't even spoken about the presentation and care taken in preparing every single dish which are as savoury as pieces of art. Its an overwhelming and other wordly experience to eat at Maison Boulud, an experience that everyone must try at least once."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We decided to try Maison Boulud for their Menu Table d'Hôte, which is available as 2 or 3 courses during weekday lunch hours. The 2-course menu is $38, and 3-course menu $45. We reserved for a table of 2 at 1pm through Opentable.Even before ordering, our waiter brought out house bread and warm butter to enjoy. There was classic French baguette and house focaccia that was really yummy. As for our menu, we chose to have the 3-course (appetizer, main, dessert):Me - petit pea soup, trout, chocolate and salted caramel (I forgot the names of the dishes.. :()Hubby - salmon tartare, beef bourguignon, and raspberry mousse cake with pistachios.There are 3 options for each course you can choose from.I actually only ordered the soup because I was cold from walking outside and because I didn't want to order the same salmon tartare as my hubby. The only other option was to get their salad which I wasn't really for.  The soup was rather large in portion, as it was served in a very deep soup bowl, and the colour of the soup was very pretty. It was refreshing to see the colour green, as I wasn't able to see much of it outside in Montreal yet! If you don't like peas, this won't be for you, as you can really taste the natural flavours of the peas very strongly. Inside the soup were small crouton? like bits that kept its crisp until the very last moment in where it entered my mouth. I was very surprised to see that they were not soggy at all while they swam around in my soup. Overall, the soup was well enjoyed and I wouldn't mind reordering it again.Hubby's salmon tartare was also quite large in portion as well, which was quite surprising because we were more used to smaller portions of tartare. For what you pay ($38 or $45), the portions were generous. It made me wonder how their dinner portions are: are they similar? Or larger? The soft salmon was balanced out by the thin crisp on the top along with leafy greens, and the roasted beets brought out more of the chewing texture of the dish. Underneath the salmon tartare was the sauce that brought the appetizer all together; the savoury sauce had sharp tanginess to it that aimed to balance out the blandness of the salmon. Although the textures were well balanced, the flavours, on the other hand, weren't and the ingredients didn't come together in synchrony unless the hidden sauce was well mixed into the tartare; we were able to taste each ingredient on its own, individually, even though there were other factors eaten together.My seafood dish looked very appealing at first glance, and I was delighted that they had seafood on their lunch menu. The main trout was cooked very well, not overdone, soft and delicate in texture. Underlying all the ingredients was the main sauce that was generally too overpowering. For dessert, I chose the most chocolate-y one; I love salted caramel and vanilla bean anything, so this dessert was a must order for me. The dessert intrigued my fascination about chocolate; I had never tried chocolate that had texture like this before! It was more like soft fudge, but not too soft that it doesn't keep its shape or melt. If there was one thing that I didn't like about the dessert was that it was dark chocolate. Now, the dark chocolate went very well with salted caramel, and even my hubby, who doesn't like very sweet things, actually really enjoyed my dessert and preferred it over his!Overall, our first visit to Maison Boulud was enjoyable. The service was great: all of our orders were correct, on time, and warm. Our waiter kept our glasses full, and he was polite and quick. The atmosphere of the restaurant divides into two, as you could be seated in the veranda or the main dining hall which is more formal. We sat in the veranda which was very nice because it had lots of natural sunlight coming in which I really liked. As many hotel restaurants are, the washrooms are not within the restaurant but in the hotel lobby. The food was okay, as there were dishes that we really liked, and some that we didn't as much. Generally, Maison Boulud is a place we would personally come with family for brunch, but I don't think we will be back anytime soon because it didn't really give us the WOW factor that we expect for a fine dining experience. Perhaps our lunch experience was an outlier, as Maison Boulud was picked #27 in Canada's Top 100 Best Restaurants! Maybe dinner is a better time to go."

We had the châtaignes et courges and a poire et sirop d`erable dessert. They were a wonderful way to finish the evening. Everyone compliments the restaurant for the service, and we definitely had more than five people waiting on us all night, but it really only added to the confusion. We also had a waiter who was so shy we couldn't hear him at all. Whatever he brought us tasted delicious, we just weren't sure what was in it!

I was totally shock to find a fly in my glass of wine. I told the waiter, and he only replaced it with a new glass and filled back the amount I had left in the glass before.

This is totally unacceptable and disappointed. I will not come back to this restaurant anymore, and will not recommend any of my friends to come here. There are many other high-end restaurants in town that have both good food and good service."
/user_details?userid=kgvTkSGVXS78xypSG8o-Bw,Pascal T.,"North Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"When I was about to enter Maison Boulud I'll be honest: I thought it would be a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel and that because of this it was likely to be a dinner with average food at an exorbitant price.I was wrong. I must say, I was quite impressed by this new Montreal restaurant. From start to finish it delivered on every level. First impressions rarely lie and I knew I might be in for a pleasant surprise when we stepped in and the Maitre D', Cyril (formerly from Europea), welcomed us by our names without having heard us speak anything but a simple hello. This shows professionalism, commitment and dedication to one's work and these qualities were further displayed when, before our dinner day, emails to the restaurant were promptly replied to, even at 8:30 AM, a time where most are either sleeping or trying to get into a semi-functional state. My wife had been in touch with him as it was a surprise birthday dinner and she wanted to make sure the vegetarian was well taken care of!It is important to note this. If the Maitre D is of this level it is very unlikely his staff will be any different and throughout the evening the staff proved this theory to be true. The service at Maison Boulud is excellent. The waiting staff strikes a perfect balance between high-end and casual. It is always very attentive without being stuffy. They are very friendly without trying to be your ""buddy"". They always make you feel like they are at your disposal without standing around like statues. They are constantly going around tables but you do not feel or notice their presence until you need them and magically here they are, just at the right time, and always willing to help in a way that doesn't make you feel like you're bothering them.I've been to numerous high-end restaurants and the service at Maison Boulud would best or match the very best of the group.Onto the food and as in all my reviews I will write about the vegetarian side of things. It offers a really interesting take on a restaurant as very often you will stretch the kitchen into dishes they don't normally make. The question usually is: will they copy paste something bland together or will they go out of their way to create dishes with creativity and flavor to it? This, in my admittedly biased opinion, really sets aside the best restaurants from the rest as it shows an extra level of dedication to their client base and, more importantly, that the kitchen has a wide array of skill sets and is willing to step out of its normal flavor and ingredient boundaries to create something special.On this, Boulud performed very well. To keep it simple I will rate each part of the meal in chronological order. Forgive me for the lack of description but since our meal i have forgotten some details.0 - Terrible10 - OrgasmicCocktail (9): Jade Green - I don't recall the name exactly but it was a beautiful green cocktail with cucumber/citrus/basil flavors. Very nice balance of flavors and an eye-catching ice centerpiece that gradually melts flavor into the glass.Bread (10): Yes I am rating bread but only for this review. The bread/butter at Maison Boulud is face-stuffing worthy. Simple fresh bread. I think we had 3 baskets. Small details like this once again separates the best from the rest. - 10Beet Salad (8): Beautiful presentation. When I saw the dish and tasted is when I knew the dinner would might be special.Butternut squash ravioli (9.5): Some of the best bites I've ever had. I would go back and eat 4 of those and call it a night. You just have to try it to understand, even my meat-eating wife was quite impressed!Mushrooms w/egg, emulsion and lettuce (7.5): This one was just OK. It was good, just less than everything else. Mix of mushrooms with an egg you break on top of it and mix. I felt like this one lacked a little extra flavor.Hazelnut potatoes w/vegetables (8.0): Never had hazelnut potatoes before but they were quite good. Perfectly fried. Crisp outside with a light golden color and soft as a pillow inside. A well done dish and I love seeing a generic ingredient like potato done differently.Lemon tart with roasted pine nuts, figs and ice cream (7.75): The only reason why I rate this a 7.5 is because my wife's dessert was mind blowing and mine wasn't. And I was the birthday boy! Ok, mine was quite good but I just wanted to eat hers as it was one of the best tasting dessert i've ever had :) And to finish the review, I'd also like to point out how beautiful the restaurant is. The decor is beautiful and just like the service, it retains the high-end feeling without making you feel like you should act differently. The colors and glass walls are especially beautiful and the fire ""pit"" in the middle is a great highlight.In conclusion, Maison Boulud is a must go in Montreal and while the price point is above average, it is worth the money, even for vegetarians.Vegetarian Food: 4.25Service: 4.85Value: 4.00"

/user_details?userid=ywOBPb4SKZaSZ1uqzwgTEA,Eric B.,"Charlotte, NC",4 star rating,"Maison Boulud is one of the better fine dining establishments in Montreal. The price tag may be steep for some and lend itself to only special occasions for others, but the food, service, and atmosphere make up for any hesitations you may have concerning the price.The quality of service I would put second to none as there were always people coming around to fill up glasses of water and just be in the vicinity to ensure you are taken care of without being over bearing so you can enjoy your special evening. The food is amazing and lives up to the name and reputation of its chef's namesake. The dishes are creatively presented and put together to have that elegant and formal presentation, with the tastes being just as good. The seasonal menu is not large, but balanced with a few options in each category such as pastas, fish, meats, and specials. I started off with some oysters and a tomato salad appetizer that was delicious! The beef duo as the main course was amazing with 2 different cuts of meat that were both tender and cooked to perfection. Lastly, the atmosphere is as classic as the Ritz within which the restaurant resides. I have never eaten inside but the setting looks intimate and classy as you walk past the fire and bar to the back covered patio, which is beside a duck pond and grassy area in the back courtyard. The furniture is simple and comfortable to create an atmosphere for a great evening.The only thing holding back the 5 star rating is that amongst the great restaurants to chose from in Montreal, this one is among the top of the price range so I feel there are better values out there for great food. However, I still feel it is one of the better places to try for that special occasion or elegant date."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I think we came on an off-night because our experience was nothing like all the spectacular reviews written about this place! :(Hubby decided to bring me here for my birthday dinner a couple nights ago, and we were super excited given all the great things written about this restaurant.Upon arrival, our car was immediately taken to be parked ($16, not bad) and we were taken into the restaurant where our coats were put away and we were shown to our seats in the quieter area of the restaurant near the back terrace. The restaurant was clean, dimly lit, and well furnished. The main spectacle was the open kitchen where you could see Chef Boulud preparing all the meals (only saw this in passing since we were seated in a different section of the restaurant).We initially wanted to order the degustation menu, but since they wouldn't tell us what dishes they were going to serve (surprise style), we decided against it as I'm a bit of a picky eater (ps. If you want the tasting menu, everyone on your table has to have it too.. Something I found a little strange). Anyways we ordered the following dishes:Appetizers: Cheese stuffed ravioli (was swimming in a soup kind of thing. Not very good.. Was missing something) and the cocoa marbled foie gras (ok but not as amazing as it sounds. It needed to be more..moist.. Also it wasn't too flavorful. Main dishes: Duo de boeuf (just ok. You can get better tasting meat at Gibbys...) and the Pot au feu (was so excited for this one... Came with several pieces of beef, one small cube of chicken with a crispy crust, and small pork stuffed raviolis. The beef was good, but again, better at Gibbys. The chicken was a little dry. The ravioli were undercooked so I didn't eat most of them). Side: wild mushrooms (hefty portion that we couldn't finish. Good but too salty) Dessert: Baba au Rum (so so disappointing) and the chocolate lava cake (finally something phenomenal).All in all, the food wasn't really good...a 2/5..martinis were very strong and tasty so 5/5.. Service was impeccable so 5/5.. And prices are what you expect them to be so no comment haha. I'd give this restaurant an overall 3/5 for the great service and drinks but will definitely not be back....."

The intention was for the two families to use this brunch to get to know one another and we were robbed of that opportunity due to the poor arrangement. In some areas the service was very slow, I asked for water with no ice and I did not receive it until after my appetizer was brought out. I ordered orange juice when the appetizer was served and did not receive it till almost the end of second course. In conclusion, this place has a nice ambiance but the food and service is mediocre for the price you pay."

We went for a large family breakfast and were seated in a private alcove as all the window seats were taken. Though the buffet and menu options were limited, the kitchen quite willingly accommodated our special requests.    The buffet option didn't seem worth it as the offerings were only fruit and sundries. We ordered a la carte and were pleased with our meal, though not blown away. The service was nothing short of the Ritz standard. The most stand out was the COFFE (I must have had at least 10 refills) and the French toast."

I got the Hazelnut Crusted Sea Scallops. Oh my god, every bit as amazing as it sounded on paper. For desert we got the Coffee and Cardamom Dessert, Crispy Tuile, Shortbread Biscuit and Espresso Ice Cream. Seriously, amazing.

No big deal, it was a rainy and humid day, and may have just been the AC unit. We were moved a table over, and this time the ceiling was dripping right onto my menu, where my food would later be. We were moved one last time, at which point we called the waitress over to ask for some salt and pepper, and she remarked ""still moving are we?"" which took us a little aback as it was a bit of a snide remark. We let it go, and were soon brought some salt and pepper, except that the salt shaker was empty. We then asked the waiter for a filled salt shaker to which she remarked ""aren't we lucky"" not ""I'm sorry"" or anything. In addition, the chair I was seated in seemed on the verge of breaking and was quite rickety, and a hair was found in our bread (none of our hairs as it was blonde and we are all brunettes). The manager did apologize for the reseating and offered us a free appetizer.The good: when the food did come out, it was amazing. I can't complain about the portion size, as it was very filling. I got the steak and it was cooked to perfection. Overall, it was a good dining experience, although I don't foresee the waitress who served us lasting there long."

/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"One chef friend of mine told me hotel restaurants and chef owned restaurant are totally different. In this case I agree, the food was missing something, it was blend, maybe it's to please and not shock the international crowd staying at the Ritz. I liked the experiance being in a nice setting etc and the service was great there were 10 different ppl bringing each plate for god sake invest more on the chef and food instead of all that sardines of servers. My bf and i had the 7 courses tasting menu for dinner and i would say they really tried to impress you by the exotic ingrediants ,say the spanish fish ok it's spanish but frozen. The italien olives cooked in sauce etc impressive but there's almost nothing local in that restaurant. By the end a young chef came to great us very briefly he seem to not even want to start a conversation just a drop in. I also found the bench in the solarium we were sitting to be really dirty sire it was white. Go to Toque if you are going to spend that kind of money you will be satisfied with the food at least. I think we should encourage local farming, it is fresher, more eco friendly etc i was thinking how many ships and flights these ingrediants took to get on my plate,  how much fuel wasted in the ocean. I felt bad and the food wasn't even wow. The pasta really desapointed me it was a slow cooked rabbit ragout taste the same as i do from my slow cooker for beef,  the fish was hard, at least the meat was tender and the italian seasoned olives in the sauce was good. To finish I was not at all impressed by desert, it was breakfast madelaine, with some chocolate pieces not even freshly made right away, the norvegian cake was good also premade they flambeed to impress you but taste was nothing unexpected. Overall In terms of effort it was ok, but should invest local food and a more experianced chef. You can't have a famous chef name restaurant and put a young chef, people come for the chef's cooking i am sure it's profitable for the restaurant running it like that at low cost with young chef at cheap labour. How are we ever get a Michelin star restaurant in Mtl if the Ritz restaurant's can't even come  close to be the Michelin Guide?"

/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It has been awhile since I've been to an upscale resto...Mainly, the reason was that the food was less than imaginative and bland, it was always pricey and sometimes just lacking in terms of portions.What I liked about this place: it's easier to get a table than at Daniel in nyc, not suit and tie required as in Daniel.What I had hoped this place would be: a less expensive Daniel, less austere experience while keeping the same style of cuisine... not what happened... Maison Boulud is good food, but it lacks depth in the menu, three fish option, two beef options, no fowl or pork?? why? and foie gras doesn't count as fowl.On to the food. We had butternut squash ravioli, seared foie gras, lamb shank rigatoni, and foie de veau grillé. For dessert we ordered pumkin tart with maple ice cream, and got something weird with mostly chocolate... go figure.The ravioli was exquisite, just as good as any top resto in MTL. The foie gras was also amazing, well balanced with balsamic vinegar and figs, tasted very good but not the most original presentation...Lamb shank rigatoni, the rigatoni was a bit tough, it was a bit hard and not so chewy, I don't know if it was on purpose but It wasn't a texture I like in pasta. The lamb shank   and sauce that went with the rigatoni was a bit too salty, my friend couldn't finish her plate. The foie de veau (veal liver) was under grilled to my taste, I understand it is sometimes left just rare so it doesn't taste too pasty but the thing was almost all red. I like it medium or cooked but I guess that's just personal preference. It came with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms, I liked the taste just wished my liver was cooked, I should have asked for it, I'm sure they would have done it...The dessert was weird, we ordered some pumpkin tart with maple ice cream, instead got this thing loaded with chocolate, whit had very little pumpkin or ice cream in it, the description didn't even have any mention of chocolate. And it wasn't too good so It was disappointing.Having eaten at Daniel in NYC, I was excited to have an NYC style french resto in MTL, alas maison Boulud resembles more the French fare in MTL than NYC."

/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Located in the newly renovated Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Maison Boulud has all the ingredients to be a staple on the Montreal restaurant scene. Daniel Bouluds (of Cafe Boulud Fame in NYC) new high-end restaurant has been opened for nearly three weeks and has started to create a buzz. While the lunch and dinner menus look fantastic, it was the brunch menu that piqued our interest. There are only a few options available on the high-end brunch (Renoir, Cafe Birks), so this was a welcome addition.First, before getting to the food, lets discuss the restaurant itself. The space is quite large, but with relatively few tables and feels both busy and intimate at the same time. Expertly decorated, the centrepiece is the open kitchen, where Chef Boulud could be seen working the pans on a recent Sunday morning. Despite the renovations, the hotel decided to keep the inner garden, and the restaurant has a beautiful terrace overlooking the duck pond. Now on to the food! The brunch menu consists of entrees and main courses, available a la carte or in a prix fixe style. Though more expensive than your regular scrambled eggs and bacon (36$) the meal comes together quite well. Numerous salty and sweet options are available. For the main course, everything from french toast to home made gnocchi to the classic hangover beater steak and eggs are available. We opted for two classic dishes, the gravlax with latkes and the croque madame. While far from extravagant, the attention to detail raise these two dishes from regular brunch to four star level. Not to be overlooked are the fries accompanying the croque madame which may be some of the best in the city.Our waiter seem to have no idea how to handle his completely packed section. Luckily, after long waits between arriving, receiving coffee and ordering, the very nice Maitre D' stepped in and took care of our service.Final Verdict : We will be back, if only to spend a night on that beautiful terrace."

In my opinion, price does not match the food experience.  The setting is pretty and somewhat formal with good service.  If you have been to the Boulud restaurant in New York on Broadway in Upper West Side (Boulud Sud I think) you will be disappointed because it doesn't match the quality and creativity."

/user_details?userid=d3kEhf6hmEFmZsGmE-IXUg,Stephanie B.,"VT, VT",5 star rating,"Really enjoyed my prix fixe Valentine's Day dinner here.  My husband and I had tried to get a sort of last-minute table here for other special occasions and you really should reserve ahead.  Anyways it was one of the pricier tables.  After reviewing the menu we were not expecting a lot.  However, our meal was delicous and the sommelier does a wonderful job.  Very impressed on balance with our wine flight pairing.  I rarely get to say that.  Based on one visit, for me - this is as good as it gets in Montreal for the food alone.  The environment is a bit stale but perfect for a special occasion and romantic as we were seated by the fireplace and our server was just perfect and really made everything right.  I lived in the NYC area for 5-6 years and it has become my benchmark for fine dining world wide.  I have tried at least 80% of the top fine dining restaurants in Montreal.  Recently, Chasse et Peche which was our second though we've been to Le Filet their sister restaurant many times (another favorite of mine), Chez l'Epicier and Europea last month.  What I look for in a great restaurant experience is to be surprised for a 1 or more dishes.  So I also look at the ease of obtaining the ingredients (it it hard for me?), interesting flavor profiles/ pairings, superlative freshness of course and advanced techniques that either I'm not familiar with or I might be but it would just be too much effort to coordinate at home.  That having been said I did not think that the dishes were too busy or that some flavors were mentioned in the description but didn't really show up in the final plate.  Personally I would love to see more restaurants like Maison Boulud here in Montreal.  Boulud's flagship is in NYC where he operates 5 restaurants or so.  So happy to have found this place.  I'll be looking for consistency.  Looking forward to trying a cocktail!  We'll be back soon."

We sat at the bar and each had a glass of champagne. My bad for not asking the price. It was 28 dollars a glass. I think the bartender should have mentioned this.We were shown to our table and offered water. It was easily 15 minutes before  someone came to take our orders. In the meantime someone else came by to let us smell the first white truffle of the season.  We kept waiting for someone to ask us about wine. It was never clear who our waiter was. It was at least 20 minutes and then our appetizers appeared!I suggested that perhaps we should talk to the sommelier first. They took the appetizers back. Another five minutes or so, and the sommelier arrived, as if everything was going according to plan. We explained what happened and she came back with wines to match our meals.  The appetizers reappeared and we had our first course.We sat for awhile and then another person came by to tell my husband that several people had returned the veal  due to toughness so he did not want my husband to order it. Strange as I had seen a post regarding their veal being tough back in 2012 as well. He changed his order. The sommelier arrived with wine selections for our main course. We waited at least 20 - 30 minutes for our mains to arrive. About half way through our meal, we were out of wine. We could not get anyone to stop to get another glass. Eventually someone came by, then, they had to find the sommelier who had to find the wine and pour it for us.We carried on as it was a special evening for our daughter.We each ordered dessert. The the sommelier arrived back to say she was giving us complimentary port due to the problems we experienced. Then two people arrived back with two more desserts telling us they were complimentary due to the troubles.No one thought to ask us if we wanted or liked port, or why 3 people who had already ordered desserts would want two more.The service was just bad. The front of house seemed to be confused about who does what.The bill was $550 before tip.We have dined at Bouley in NYC and the bill was higher than that for two people,but was worth every penny.This was not.I should say the food was quite good, but sadly the service really spoiled the experience."

We dined there recently and at different times Brunch on Fathers Day in their what I call ""The Garden of Eden"" which included their famous burger with the most amazing fries, lunch included an appetizer the tropezienne salad a refreshing just right mix of greens with a vinaigrette that we need to have them share with us the recipe. Now dinner has a variety of amazing dishes starting with the duo salmon or the scallop which were served by an extremely professional staff and were to die for. Our main meals consisted of a pasta with clams with a mouthwatering creamy without the cream sauce. The cod was served with a touch of olive oil and was so fresh that it's a must try dish in Montreal.Our friends were so impressed with the decor and the setting sitting inside a glamorous but not overly done restaurant that has a garden as its setting. Was it expensive not more than any other first class restaurant in our beautiful city and yet the quality and service led by Cyril their manager was above and beyond what we were expecting. The to die for desserts were a masterpiece of perfection in taste and presentation especially the chocolat coulant. This restaurant has again established Montreal as the gourmet capital of Canada and for that we thank you Daniel. Bienvenue a Montreal !!!"
/user_details?userid=U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"Disapointed for breakfast. Pricey for the quality-there's much better breakfasts in this town.  THere were good things and bad things: GOOD:  1. Very well executed eggs benedict, with spinach.  Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy. 2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.  3.  Great setting and decor.4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming. BAD: 1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml. Waiter insisted that the second green tea was called ""crocetia"" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was ""formed"" tea or ""twig"" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec ""I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience"".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience. 2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring. 3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes. 4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, ""maybe they charge for additional coffee"".  5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.  6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast.7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.  8.  Bagel was hard and dry. 9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.  Tasted almost like store bought Philadelphia brand, though it was grainier.  I think maybe Daniel has too many restaurants.  Ramsay has the same problem. If you come to Montreal, you better make sure your staff is not carrying around a lot of Montreal service habits."

We walked in and out of the first place and then circled back and did a walk in table for four at Maison Boulud. Spectacular service and food. Started with the fresh Canadian oysters and a beautiful whiteburgundy off a well thought out wine list. Moved into the egg yolk ricotta filled ravioli with the black truffle sauce and finished up with the rack of suckling pig..   Absolutely spectacular evening. This is not a inexpensive or moderate priced restaurant but if you are a foodie who pays up for the food and the experience its worth every cent. Was psyched to learn theRitz serves breakfast in the same restaurant. Amazing cheese and meat course to start. Two at our table had thescrambled eggs with a huge serving of beautiful salmon . My daughter had the waffle with chocolate sauce and whipped Creme and I enjoyed the to die for Eggs Benedict ..    I wouldn't stay. Anywhere else and I will absolutely be back to Maison Boulud again.....I highly recommend it!    Trust me on this, just go, bring your amex card and close your eyes and enjoy....."
