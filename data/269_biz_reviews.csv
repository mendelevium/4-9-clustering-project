/user_details?userid=SmdjvnqkvNdg8m3S_GnoDQ,Marie-Anne P.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You can't go wrong with Breizh Café. As a Frenchwoman, I always appreciate an authentic creperie, and this one, on top of being conveniently located in the heart of the Plateau Mont-Royal, is also exquisite. The food is both simple and incredibly tasty - you can technically customize a salted butter buckwheat crepe with a select range of ingredients, such as leek, swiss cheese and maple syrup. The ready-made crepes range from the ubiquitous cheese and ham to the more complex smoked salmon and dill cream. And their sweet crepes are equally delicious - I personally recommend the lemon and sugar crepe. On top of the menu they also have ready-made brunches for every palate. Last but not least, the service is friendly and efficient. They're genuinely lovely, professional people and will go above and beyond to ensure a great culinary experience. High marks all around!"

They have a great selection of crepes ranging from sweet to salty.Saturday afternoon is when I decided to check out this great location. I had a feeling it would be busy so I called 30 minutes ahead of time to reserve a table. Upon arrival I was greeted by a very smiley red head woman with great glasses ! The place was pretty busy but it wasn't loud like most other breakfast joints so that was great because I don't like yelling over others just to ask how someone's day is.I was having trouble picking since there were so many possibilities but finally I decided on the québécois which consisted of apples bacon and Swiss cheese. Mmmm ! What a great crepe that was it was exactly what I was looking for, my cravings were met. I suggest this location to anyone who's big on crepes or just wanting to try something different, there's literally a crepe for everyone."
/user_details?userid=uIUQqkbMiP51qxSciJWtBA,Steven L.,"Highland Park, NJ",4 star rating,"I wanted to eat a heavy carb déjeuner before climbing Mount Royal. It just so happened I passed this crêperie conveniently located on Boulevard Saint-Laurent. This cafe uses buckwheat flour for their savory crepes in the style of Brittany region of France. You can order the regular or large size crepe. I went for the grande size LA Québécoise (stuffed with cooked apples, swiss cheese, bacon, and maple syrup). Paired with a bowl of cafe au lait, it was a hearty breakfast. This is my go-to place for crepes next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Delicious traditional crepes!A traditional crepe restaurant on St. Laurent. The interior of the restaurant was homey, and the patio allowed you to be in the street and people watch as folks were roaming around during the Mural street festival. We stopped in here just for dessert. We tried the:1. Kir Breton -  a small flute of a creamy, fruity cider. Really bright and effervescent, a real treat. It could have been dessert on its own!2. ""Le Sniker"" crepe - a dessert crepe with chocolate and caramel, topped with ice cream. The crepe was crispy and thin, and the filling was nice and sweet.The experience overall was good; we're glad we tried it, though perhaps we aren't crepe people and weren't wowwed. The restaurant has an extensive menu of sweet and savory options that were very reasonably priced. We would come back to try some more options. Service was friendly enough!--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"
/user_details?userid=UOxuNzjOxIC7XyOkbHyHuQ,Jessalyn T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite cafe in Montreal so far. FOODAll the crepes are thin and well done with a chewy texture and a nice crisp. I got to try a couple from the menu during my 2 visits. My personal favorites are as follow:Meal - La Parisienne (ham, Swiss cheese, bechemel sauce, mushrooms) - the melted Swiss cheese and bechemel sauce inside the warm close phased crepe give a creamy texture.Dessert - Caramel Au Beurre Sale (salted caramel butter) - the crepe is not overly sweet due to the combination of caramel and salted butter. Sweetness is just right for my personal preference.If you are craving for both salty and sweet crepes, La Quebecoise (cooked apple, bacon, Swiss cheese, maple syrup) is not a bad choice either! AMBIENCEThe environment was quite nice with some soft background music. Two of the tables are close to the glass sliding doors, which are opened during the day. You can enjoy some sunlight if the weather is nice. STAFFThe servers are all very polite and friendly. My family and I visited here 2 days in a row. On our first night, the server was considerate and told us right away when we entered the cafe that the card machine was not working before we were seated. My mom and I were looking for the washroom after our meal and the server told us immediately before we even asked. PRICE Price is reasonable. Crepes range from $5 to $19 before tax (from very plain to ones with scallop and salmon). A person would spend on average $15 including tips and tax (assuming you're getting a classic crepe with protein and a cup of regular coffee)."

I was so excited to see a galette restaurant -- we do not have them in the US so I haven't had a proper galette since I studied in Rennes. Overall it was very good -- I got the smoked salmon one. I love smoked salmon, but I think they put a little bit too much in - the flavor was very overwhelming. I would probably go back and just order something else. Overall it was a nice experience!"

/user_details?userid=zJlmL8AO66_M1b1cQD0d9Q,Ngoc P.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"I've only had crepes probably less than a handful number of times. They're often soggy and dense where I'm from in the U.S. so I'm always a bit hesitant to order them. However, when we crossed the border into Québec, I made it a mission to eat as many as I can. Now that I'm back home, I'm totally screwed since I now get frequent cravings and can't get anything remotely close to these amazingly crisp, warm, delicious (and relatively inexpensive) crepes. I had 2 savory crepes, and one sweet one (mind you this was only breakfast) and I can't begin to describe how good they are. The buckwheat crepes are very different to what I'm used to; very mild in flavor, crisp, and light. The filling to crepe ratio was perfect. The dessert hazelnut crepe was also the bomb; brilliant play on textures. & of course I had to add ice cream.Interior was very modern and hip. Breizh is perfect for dates and mingling and the service was fantastic. Great coffee as well; highly recommend the visit!"

We even got up to watch the crepe master in action. All crepes were made out of buckwheat flour which made them gluten free and extra delicious!  For dessert we had a sweet crepe with home made caramel and it was to die for! Would recommend their crepes to anyone!

They waited until everyone arrived and all our orders came pretty altogether considering they only have like 3 crepe skillets. Food was great, I ordered the one with egg, goat cheese and creamed leeks and it was super tasty! The goat cheese was strong but not too much, creamed leek was the best part. I liked dipping each of my pieces into the yolk. However considering the prices the portion could be more. I also ordered the far breton dessert, which is a flan cake with raisin-like pieces. It was different but still good, it was my first time having real flan cake so I don't have a good reference :P This is definitely a place I'd bring people to!"

All the Breton assortments here in a great casual environment...A+"

Immediately when we walked in we were happily greeted by the hostess and given a table. The atmosphere was great, and my French friends said it reminded her of some small family owned French cafe's she used to go to. In regards to our food, everything was amazing! I ordered Le Breton combo. The galette with egg, ham, and Swiss was delicious and very filling, a good size for the price especially considering it came with fresh fruit, great coffee, a sample of their homemade mango-banana-strawberry juice, and a dried plum pudding cake for dessert.Really excellent, food, service, and atmosphere!

Had dessert crepes first time- crepe Suzette, chocolate crepe and Snickers crepe. All were outstanding as was their cappuccino. Service was impeccable, the waitress was very friendly and efficient. The second time around I wanted to try a savory crepe while the family went for sweet ones again. I ordered a large (grande) Nordic crepe with smoked salmon, Swiss cheese, spinach and dill cream on top. It was huge, stuffed to the brim and absolutely delicious. Everyone tried it and loved it. Again service was impeccable. If you're visiting Montreal looking to try authentic great crepes you should give this place a chance, you won't regret it."

/user_details?userid=nMhaMRwf27UvNNNQvctGnQ,Rachel F.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,Well the food was fine. Nothing to write home about the service was horrendous. Maybe because we are American. They told us we couldn't have extra plates but there was a ginormous stack of plates. And the table next to us was brought small plates for sharing. Took over 2 hours to bring out 4 crepes. If you are American stay away....

We had the ""complété"" (ham, Swiss, and sunny side up egg) and veggie (Swiss, onions, spinach, tomato). There were multiple tea choices. We enjoyed the soup du jour which was carrot and ginger. The crepes were great, light, and not greasy at all (which we have found at crêperies in Paris). Very happy with this place and the prices are reasonable."

We were touring downtown Montreal and decided to get crepes, and every place downtown was closing right at 6. We are so glad we came here instead! It's set in a more residential part of town surrounded by a lot of different food options. The coffee selection was short but delicious, and they had wine and cider options as well. The crepes (both sweet and savory) were amazing and well priced. The service was outstanding. Definitely worth a visit."

Do you want a pokestop while you have breakfast?Here is your spot. The crepes are great, really well balanced and large enough to fill you up. It is odd that they come as a square, but they still are tasty. Most of the savory crepes come on a buckwheat crepe, which is different but not bad. Im sure if you asked for regular crepe stuff, they would give it to you. The dessert crepes are awesome, and I recommend getting one. You can split 2 crepes between 2 people and you would be good. Only complaints were that the coffee was a little burnt and they were pricier than my local crepe place. All in all though, I would go back here. Note: I didnt check out the shitter."

I ordered the québécois, the mix of caramelized apples with bacon and maple syrup was well balanced. It was so good that I ordered another chestnut cream crepe to finish my meal. I love this French style crepe."
