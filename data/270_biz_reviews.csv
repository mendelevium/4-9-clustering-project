Never expect some Asian food is such quality in Montreal - especially in a sub-bur area.Ordered a curry with chicken... Inside the curry there are generous amount of mushroom, broccoli, bell pepper, lettuce... The chicken pieces are soft and tasty. I asked them to make it a little spicy and the favour is just right.It is a little store in the middle of nowhere."

/user_details?userid=_9wQT4wwQKNIMMDZ9IuT0w,Charles B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The only Thai restaurant in the corner. I tried it out since I just moved to this neighborhood and I was not disappointed at all. Their chicken curry and peanut dumplings are amazing!
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's fun to venture out of the trendy areas of Montreal and discover hidden gems that lie off the beaten path.  Case in point was tonight with Une Nuit à Bangkok which is located in Rosemont.  There really is nothing in this particular area of the borough so this restaurant is a great find and much appreciated.  It sits on Bellechasse which is mostly residential save for the odd business here and there.The restaurant is owned by the people who bring you the Tuk Tuk food truck.  The owner serves and handles customers while the chef cooks up the food in the back.  It is very small inside so I would recommend a reservation because it is quite popular.  The restaurant is quite casual and of course being a Thai place you can expect some Thai-inspired decor.  We started with spring rolls and dumplings which admittedly aren't the most Thai dishes around but I have a major weakness for dumplings in peanut sauce.  Both were pretty solid.  The peanut sauce clearly had a spice in it to give it extra flavour.  I can't put my finger on what it was but I did enjoy it.  That was followed by a shrimp pad thai for me.  The dish was well seasoned and they got the spicy levels just right.  It was spicy enough to have a little zing to it but not so much that I was breathing fire.Prices are very reasonable.  Dinner for two came out to about $50 after tax which isn't bad at all considering we ordered appetizers, mains and beer.  They also do takeout so if you live nearby you can come here to pick up some food for lunch or dinner.I am already thinking about how soon I can come back here to try something else on the menu.  It is great to see a place like this in a part of the neighbourhood where dining options are few and far between.  Definitely give this place a try when you get a chance!"

The dumplings and satay appetizers were average. The main courses proved to be the worst Thai food I have ever had. The pad thai was terribly unauthentic, tasting largely of ketchup. We tried a few other main courses and they were all tasteless. The dishes came with almost no meat in them: had we finished them, we would have left hungry. However, the food was so bad, we left a lot of it."

/user_details?userid=h8_On4sJArFngkF9X2WAJg,Timmy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing food. Honestly some of the best Thai in all of Montreal. Location a little isolated but worth the travel. And not $$$ either. Had the Pad Thai and Crispy Chicken with entree of dumplings... well done! A+
/user_details?userid=1kl1RxQ3w37LKrP0Q3h-4w,Joely L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious! Waitress was really lovely and the food was amazing! Small place, but worth going to if you are after fresh, yummy Thai food. Price was also very reasonable for the size of the meals. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"

/user_details?userid=EkvEbvx7mcX6AQ4EcxhBpQ,PJ R.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Plenty of vegetarian options and the spice level was right where we wanted it. Had the curry and pad Thai, both were great. Also recommend the local IPA."
/user_details?userid=4bKBpy4e2ATwtcPGU2CC4Q,Sue G.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I had high hopes for this restaurant. Food is average at best and lacks the complexity and balance of flavours one finds in Thai food. Menu is also limited to noodles and rices dishes, with only one type of dessert. For what we ordered it was also way too expensive.  The waitstaff were friendly, however. I would say that Pamika Brasserie Thai is a far better choice than this place."
/user_details?userid=uN-R8j0JexLz2AEBYOByIA,Nico L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute resto food and friendly service. Not too many restos in the area, so this one is a nice change. We had the pad Thai and red curry chicken. Portions were good and the food hit the spot. They have a small terasse in the summer so you can enjoy your meal outside too."
/user_details?userid=EUS7elwcBq5wrtjKrrQFBw,Jeye Q.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"We decided on this restaurant for our last meal on our road trip to Montreal. Food was awesome! Portions were great and service was amazing. The waitress was nice enough to translate and explain every single item on the menu for us in English. Pad thai was very tasty, not overly sour like some places. Pad sew was amazing too, not drenched in soy sauce like usual. The mango salad was my favourite, very fresh and light. My kids loved the fried rice, very flavourful. We also made two orders of the satay chicken skewers, the chicken was juicy and flavourful, not dry. Price was very fair. Will definitely come back here when we're in town again."
