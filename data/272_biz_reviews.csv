/user_details?userid=cNNW36ukDqpuiDgxJv9zjw,Ray S.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,Really good and great service. Staff were so friendly and what a nice patio. Drinks are such good value and prices right. Don't pass it out.
/user_details?userid=xC7H80dCJY_4VnFMqLgtLQ,Kenny P.,"Buffalo, NY",4 star rating,"We stumbled into this place by chance. We were starving and this place had a really nice aesthetic so we decided to check it out. The wait staff was kind of dismissive and a little rude at times but the vibe of this place was phenomenal. The real star was poutine, though. Thin, crispy fries with awesome curds and a tasty gravy made this the best poutine we had while we were in Montreal. This could very well be personal preference but damn was it gooooood! And even if you're not convinced on their food, this place still seems like an awesome place to grab a drink after work."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for pre-night out drinks and food. My friends had been before and said the food was good and then the restaurant turned into a club so it might be worth it to try out. I got the tartare and some fruity cocktail thing. The tartare was pretty good and on Monday's they are all 50% off! The drink was soso but I also don't like alcohol so I can't be surprised. Prices are in the mid-range, food quantity is adequate, and service is pretty fast and attentive given how fast paced it is. Around 11pm they remove the tables and chairs and only the bar and the seating around the restaurant remain. This is what they mean by it turns into a club. People weren't really dancing though so we ended up trying other clubs.I'm not a club person though and I feel like I've tried it enough times to say I most likely won't be going out to clubs again in the near future."
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I'm rating 3 stars because the service was very bad. It took about 30mins to get a table while there was room for more than 50 people when we got inside. As mentioned there wasn't a lot of customers but it took an eternity to get a waiter/ waitress. We stayed another 30-40 mins without service. No one came up to us, no water at the table. We actually stayed just to see how bad it could get. It was sunny and beautiful outside, no stress so we didn't mind staying and expecting for someone to care about us. Finally THE BARTENDER comes and offer the drinks menu, very friendly and apologized for the wait. Besides all the bad customer service experience the food was really good. The cocktails, one of the best I had. I would recommend if you have time to waste."
/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Situated in Saint-Hyacinthe, I was pleasantly surprised to find this lively place. The ambiance is very buzzing; it's modern and seems to be a cool place to hang out with friends. They have live music sometimes; there's a mix of people from students to business people.I ordered their fried calmar as an entree; to be honest I was disappointed. It was over fried; almost seems like an old oil they used to fry the calmars. There was a lot of batter; a bit too salty to my taste.For the main dish; I had their lobster roll. It was decent; lots of big pieces of lobster with tiny shrimps to compliment it. Their fries were quite good actually.They also have a menu full of cocktails (it is a mixology bar after all).Our waitress was quite nice; despite the amount of people we got served quite fast.Overall great little place to hang out on a terrasse with friends in St-Hyacinthe.Fun fact; they are opening one in Montreal soon. Might check it out."
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",2 star rating,"Stopped in on a Sunday at around at around 7 because my BF read somewhere that their cocktails had won awards of some sort. The outdoor seating area was pretty packed, but we were able to nab a table as soon as we got there.For drinks, I had the Hibiscus (Smirnoff raspberry vodka, Lillet Blanc, Chambord, aloe juice, lemon juice, hibiscus syrup, white cranberry juice). I did not care for this. It reminded me of cough syrup. I'm really glad I got the small jar. My BF got the big jar of the Shaman (Smirnoff vodka, Soho, tonic syrup, lemon juice, raspberry puree, Sprite, 3D lychee-watermelon skull). This tasted better than mine but it was way too sweet. He said the big jar was too much for him, which was double the size of mine. It's not so much the alcohol content, but more of the sugar. I don't know how anyone would be able to stomach the grail cup size one, unless they are sharing with multiple people. If the rest of the cocktails on the menu are like ours, I would say they sound better than they actually taste. If you don't want cocktails, they have $4 pints all day. Also, they have a special on Sundays where you pay SAQ (Quebec government owns all liquor stores) price on the wines.For food, none of the mains really appealed to us, so we decided to just get some tartare. We did the tartare trio, where you get to pick any three tartares/tatakis with a choice of a side (we chose rice). We went with the Italian beef (Prosciutto, pine nuts, tomato confit, basil and Parmesan shavings), Lemon Dill Salmon (Capers, shallots and chive), and Spice Tuna Tataki (marinated red tuna, Asian mayonnaise and roasted peanuts). All of them were just okay. None of the flavors complemented the fish, but seemed to just cover the flavor up. Makes you wonder...Overall, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. At least the service was good. It's not their fault that the food/drinks are mediocre."
/user_details?userid=MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",3 star rating,"I was very surprised to find I'm writing the first review of this business. When I arrived on a Thursday night, it was already very busy, tough to find seats, and yet no entry on Yelp. After a bit of Internet searching, I learned Shaker Mixology (or Mixologie) is a chain, and their restaurant in Montreal is their newest. Evidently their reputation precedes them, and rightly so. There were lots of people ordering food and drink, watching basketball on the bar TVs, and generally having a good time.So why only 3 stars? Only because my experience here wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, based only on how long it took us to get the attention of a server, and our lesson learned about what's better to order here. The menu is quite large, pub food on steroids, and everything we saw delivered elsewhere looked delicious. They have a great beer selection, but we wanted cocktails. Their signature cocktails are mostly rum, vodka, and tequila based, getting a lot of space on the menu, all served in mason jars. But we wanted something more classic, so we went to the smaller, ""classic cocktails,"" selection on a different page. These, unfortunately, were a bit off in taste, not quite made right. But perhaps, being fairly new, these were simply cocktails the bartenders did not yet have much experience making. Apart from that, I would definitely recommend this as a place to bring your friends for a fun time."
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After seeing this place on social media, I had to try it out! While the food, drinks and ambiance were great, the service was very mixed. Coming on a Saturday night, there was obviously a line up to get in, luckily a friend arrived earlier than out group and got a table for us. As we tried to go in, the hostess stopped us at the front to ask us if we had a reservation, which we explained that we didn't have a reservation however we had our friend waiting inside with a table for us. Clearly she didn't believe us and asked for our friends name (which she wouldn't even know since it was a walk-in not a rsvp). After replying, she let us go in with hesitation. Once seated, we were able to order our food and receive it in 15mins - the service was quick! They had a big selection of cocktails, which made it hard to choose (everything looked good). We decided on the Holy Grail size Peach Sangria (the fish bowl cocktail) - which was very delicious but had too much ice. The burgers (Double Fried Cheeseburger and Breaded Chicken Burger) and lobster roll were very tasty and came in a good portion. Although, the lobster roll had more shrimp than lobster. On the side, it came with a creamy refreshing coleslaw and skinny fries. We were also served a bucket of various tasty hot sauces. While the food and the drinks tasted great and had good portions, I would remove a star because of the hostess and the server. Our server had varying moods every time he came to us, while initially greeting us nicely, he ignored us twice when attempting to call him to order, was a little rude when placing our order which he rudely cut off my friend who was first ready to order and gave attitude when my other friend wanted to modify his fries for a poutine (which he was willing to pay extra for). Overall, this new place is still worth trying and coming back to. The atmosphere was lively and great for groups, the food and drinks were tasty and worth the price (~12-20$ a dish) plus the food service was quick! The only downside was the service by the hostess and the server."
/user_details?userid=BIKr1Wh69GbdCtg2N3pMRw,Will S.,"Punta Gorda, FL",5 star rating,"We just came to Montreal for a long weekend. This restaurant was recommended to us by a local. We went at 6 pm on a week night and it was busy. There was outdoor seating which looked fun. We sat inside as the outdoor was packed.We went with our 2 children, 7 and 10, and they liked it as well. The inside was a chic industrial feel. The drinks were delicious and they make virgin versions for the children ( I got the Mary Poppins which was great!). The waiter was funny and helpful.The children food may have been better than the adult food. The kids spaghetti was great and the kid's cheeseburger was flavorful. I ended up eating my son's leftovers.The only criticism was the place was a little pricey but it was worth it. If you are in town give it a try."
/user_details?userid=5o05OPIAhp5oAs7E6a9JNQ,Crystal Y.,"Kaohsiung, Taiwan",4 star rating,We would like to get something new when the power went out. Came here to have lunch on Tuesday. It's a huge sport bar with great vibe. We ordered two salmons poke bowl and Cochonnet burger. The burger tasted great and juicy. The poke bowl was full of my favorite ingredients but the rice was chewy. Maybe we'll try the other burgers after 5 pm on Tuesday next time.
/user_details?userid=ZI3-iUxIdC1purEoWB-qEQ,Allyssa G.,"Lachine, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Booked my birthday dinner here, very accommodating when more people than expected showed up. They have a great birthday deal - free meal & dessert with a party of 8+. Food was great & very fair price. There are many different drink options & they are all amazing. The waitress we had gave us the best service ever, she was working alone for a group of 15+ and we never had to ask for something twice. The restaurant is perfectly located on St. Laurent street, close to the metro & the clubs."

If you are looking for something clean and new in Le Plateau, this is your spot. It's safe and will provide you with a fine meal. Decent beer list. Lots of different sizes."
/user_details?userid=Dx1aQ9yOMGEvyMqjdLw-rw,Anita G.,"Charlottesville, VA",4 star rating,"Totally fun restaurant....I like it when restaurants are busy and have a fun ambiance.  The menu was beautiful and was filled with items we wanted to order.  There was a HUGE mixed drink list...we chose two and got the big ones...they were delicious, but definitely seemed watered down.  Lots of juices and not too boozey, but for $16, I like my drinks to be extra boozey .  The sandwiches were big and shareable.  We had the double burger and the fried chicken sandwich.  The nachos were okay.  But we did enjoy the tartares...the Asian beef was excellent.  The shrimp and lobster was refreshing.  We loved the outside patio as well.  Great service and they were so kind as we practiced our limited French!  Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=9k7cVlSxD_0VxLmxrpq63A,Jose A.,"Fanwood, NJ",4 star rating,"Great service eating dinner at the bar, this place is most popular with the young millennial set. Relatively small menu focused on small bits and burgers in a variety of styles. A fun place if you're in a big group. Pales in comparison to the wonderful restaurant it replaced in that spot, but I guess times are just changing."
/user_details?userid=7DQBOU7P6BBlo4TPpjMUNw,Craig D.,"Laurentian Hills, Kitchener, Canada",2 star rating,Drink service was very slow. Recommended drink had no subtlety. Food -- blt burger and veg burger was kinda lame. Fries were cold. Wasn't worth the money.
/user_details?userid=GZDBgqqE1Bp5WXS-_5EgzQ,Marianne C.,"Lachine, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"great experience, our waitress was so good at her job and was really chill, came with a group of 12 and  everything was really well organized, no food mistakes, no late meals, yummy drinks that weren't watered down (it's way too common to receive a watered down cocktail), overall i would totally recommend this place for a birthday dinner or event  of the sort, it was really a good atmosphere too"
