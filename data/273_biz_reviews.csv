/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"After dinner, we were looking for a close place to grab a drink so we decided to head to Le Saint-Bock. I've only been here one other time.We dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 8:45pm) and the outdoor terrasse was packed. We went inside where there was a plethora of seats available. There's also multiple TV's inside.The beer menu is annoyingly only on screens but there is a food menu that they bring to the table. 44 different beers and ciders on tap. Service is spotty. - Triple brett chardo (#14) ($7.83) - Triple aux Bretts Fût De Chardonnay - CID original (#25) ($7.83) - basic cider, nothing special about this one. - Small beer mac & cheese ($9.00) - this came out piping hot. Don't touch the pan! Creamy and oozy.LSB beers aren't the best but aren't the worst either."

Slow customer service on Friday afternoon even the place is almost empty due to the pandemic. No menus, it has to be checked online, they have a list of beers written on a blackboard but most of them are not available, the staff looks like they could not be bothered with anything, after they brought the glasses of water and waited for about 5 minutes we just got up and left"
/user_details?userid=p5UpfL_k2rqrhFw7gBSm7g,Kojhi C.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,Stumbled upon this spot on my most recent trip to Montreal and it didn't disappoint. Need to kill time as me and my boy waited for our air bnb check in and this was the perfect place. The atmosphere was great considering it was 12pm. Good music had TVs going in the background. The honey garlic wings were great and the drinks were decently priced. The bartender was really nice and accommodating.
/user_details?userid=rLh63PoxknAV52w5IkmcQA,Crystina S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We did not enjoy our visit to Saint Bock. We were sat at a tiny table so close to another that the person behind me kept getting up and bumping me no matter how much I moved over. It took about 10 minute to get the menu, and no one explained that their beer menu was just on screens around the restaurant. Having bad eyesight, I couldn't read them. We asked for a beer menu, and he said ""it's on the website"" Wow. We ordered our drinks. Beer #5 was alright, their white sangria was not. I had the Galvaude ""burger"" and my dinner mate had the Métropolitain.Mine was a bad attempt at a hot chicken sandwich. Pretty confident the chicken was that pre-cooked stuff you get at Costco and reheat, when it was advertised as pulled/shredded chicken and it wasn't. The gravy they used was way too salty, and I that's from someone that puts salt on everything. The Metropolitain was about 3 slices of smoked meat. Really disappointing for $18. Fries were pretty good. The server walked by our table with empty glasses about 5 times and never once asked if we wanted anything else. We felt pretty ignored and unwelcome."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Yes, they have a significant beer selection, but the waiter we had couldn't seem to use his words to talk about them. Maybe it was an english thing? I tried in french but didn't get any further along in the details I had. Charcuterie board I only liked one of the four meats, and I don't know how that's possible when I eat pretty much everything but maybe it was meant for those with a more... developed palette? Overale the place is really hyped up and I don't get it. Beers were average, food was average, service was subpar."
/user_details?userid=IzJ36jX6V6ky5BtoN-Agng,Chun P.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Again, another awesome bar that makes me love Quebec more, and hate France a bit more...  Le Saint-Bock is a popular craft beer bar, the place was jam packed the Friday night we walked in.  Luckily a couple of bar stools opened just as the wife and I approached. Thirty-something different craft brews are on draft at any given time, if you can't find something you are truly a hipster beer snob.  The friendly bartender gave us a few pointers on all the stouts, belgians, and scotch ales, our favorites.  Most beers are reasonably priced between $5-9, and I'm talking about Canadian dollars, so that's 20% off for us Americans. Sweet!  We didn't order food, but the pub grub of burgers, nachos, and poutine all looked delicious. Despite the busy Friday crowd, the nice cordial barman gave us complimentary samples of the beers he thought we'd like too...that would NEVER happen in France.  A couple locals chatted us up too... good times...I love Montreal and Quebec!"

We ordered the pulled pork poutine and the American burger with poutine. The pulled pork was very dried out, almost like a jerky. The burger was fine but my knife, upon unwrapping, was very dirty.  The waiter was sweet and when he needed to go behind the bar he said a waitress would take over.  We finished eating about 10 minutes ago and still haven't see her.  I really dislike leaving poor reviews. With luck our next stop will be better."

They have the 4 largest collection of bottled beers so you will definitely find a beer that makes you happy, plus, they brew their own beers on site as well. The pouting is delicious. The cheese curd is unpasteurized and fresh (can't get that in the states). The gravy is beef broth and has beer mixed into it.... just don't add ketchup or they will give you weird looks, it's not accepted here.The bathrooms are downstairs and you need to go down some narrow steps...if you are drinking, you might need an escort to help you down."

In winter you can sit inside, watch a sport event and wish summer is here. It doesnt matter the season, as long as you can drink their superb beer you know things will be great."

Impressive and extensive beer selection, prime location on St. Denis, tasty comfort food, and the loungy patio make this restaurant/bar a huge draw. The patio was packed any time of day the weather was nice. Inside was inviting, but who wants to be inside during summer in Canada? Children are allowed on the patio up until 8 pm, which is a good indication the party starts around then. Server was very kind and timely throughout the meal. The poutine with jalapeños and sausage was especially delicious and not as hot as it appeared. The mac and cheese was not a favorite for children with the meat and beer flavor, but adults will gladly enjoy. Glad to see some salad options on the menu to help balance the rest of the glutinous food. Ideal place to lounge with friends and drink pints for hours. Credit cards accepted."

Lower lighting with an overall nice and relaxing atmosphere. My bartender was awesome, I don't speak a lick of French and was curious about certain French words describing the beers.I ordered the Nagano burger and subbed out fries for a poutine  (I'm in Montreal....of course I Will!) The burger was flavorful, slathered in bacon jelly and mayo! The one small issue I had was the poutine was a $3.50 upcharge and was very very small....left me wanting more!Great spot, wouldn't definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=iquCZU8tjmRQrnDgci5YpQ,Cori C.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"This is not a place I would have chosen on my own. The pink lighting. The pounding music. It has a distinctly loungey vibe that doesn't go with the idea of a brewery at all. It seems like the place to find someone testing out Rules of the Game, not find fantastic beers.But I was talked into it and I'm glad I was. The beer menu (40 beers on tap, plus plenty more in bottles) was on some horrible rotating screen, but it's also online. I did a flight because there were too many options to just pick one, followed by another round.The blueberries with hot peppers sounded like a bold move that would either be wonderful or the worst (it was wonderful). The Duchess of Burgundy was by far my favorite, though.I'm sure I'll be back to try some more."
/user_details?userid=0-H9ASZU3JtiI5QNM1abbA,John O.,"Peabody, MA",4 star rating,"So this was a ten minute walk from our hotel up rue Ste. Denis. This a sit yourself place with options for sitting inside or on the street deck. The ambience was cozy and welcoming. Service was friendly and prompt as well.The beer selection was available on a couple flat-screens in the pub. The bar offers wi-fi as well, and if you can't easily view the flat-screens, you can go on their website and see what is available. I thought this was a great idea to avoid waste with making print of the beer selections, as I imagine it is always changing. My only complaint was the menu wouldn't download. When it did, I found that it was a little different from ones provided by staff. But these are technical issues, who needs a website to get your drink on?My wife got the BBQ chicken wings. They were tiny, but delicious and delicate. I got le Nazegon (looking for it on the website menu, to no avail) which was a pork style burger. It was juicy and delicious. Some of the fries though hot, were a little undercooked. Overall though, it was worth stopping in."
/user_details?userid=tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,Jay M.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"An impressive variety of beers to choose from, available in flights of up to 5 beers. The catch? The beers weren't that great and the prices were extreme. $19 post tax / pre tip for a flight is pretty extreme!Now I'll give them credit for the fact they had many different styles and even some weird experimental things like ""marijuana beer"" which I'm guessing they drop hop with herb and thus increases the costs, but either way, I left underwhelmed with most of my selections. I'm also not sold on the atmosphere of the place, and my bartender was pretty cold and inattentive. While I don't speak french, I know she spoke english, and while I'm fine sitting at a bar without conversation, I felt zero engagement at all from the time of sitting down to the time of asking for my bill (without even being asked about another drink order). Overall, pretty a pretty meh experience that I'll be skipping on my next trip to town."
/user_details?userid=XIkydFm5vkMpXXhnO26rgw,Chris R.,"Litchfield, NH",5 star rating,"Ate here 9/8. Beer was good, I had the IPA pretty standard. The good, the food did not disappoint. We accidentally got onion rings which all 4 in my party felt were the best ever, especially with the horseradish sauce. Then my wife and friend got the ""soup of the moment"" which was French onion. They both said it was better than any other French onion soup they have had. I tried it and it was really good but it was a first time for me. I got the wings and fries, wings good flavor but could have had more heat. Fries like warm but good flavor. Overall the wait didn't bother me and would definately return with hopes the French onion soup is on the menu."

My husband and I had a round of drinks along with some appetizers (nachos and vegetable beignets (warning: vegetable beignets = falafel... we cracked up so hard thinking they would be actual beignets)). Service was friendly and quick at a busy time on Thursday evening. It is a bit loud with the music (John Mayer's CD was playing on full blast), but worth going to try their local beers."

Either way, Saint Bock has you covered.They have an ever-evolving beer list written on a chalkboard outside. We came here twice in a week and the list almost completely changed over. They brew a lot of their own stuff, and what we tried was really, really good. They had a great sour beer called the Abomination, which was gone the second time we showed up. Too bad.They have a beer with vanilla flavors that they serve with a marshmallow. Plus, they also have a full bar so if you want a cocktail or mixed drink, you can have that too. But really, why?They also have the famed Beer Bible, which is a list of a ton of imported and specialty beers. We had a few of those as well. Our waiter JC was a super cool guy who gave us wonderful recommendations (and also shots). My favorite was the Cantillon Gueuze Lambic.Great place to sit curbside and people watch (read; watch girls walk by in very short shorts). It's also next door to a gentlemen's club, so that's always interesting."
/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"This restaurant was our meeting spot for this fantastic craft beer tour that we took on our first day in Montreal. We spent about an hour in here as a group, before moving on to our second stop.Our tour group had a small section of tables clustered together, close to the bar. There we sat, getting schooled on proper tasting technique and sampling two of the bar's many draft beers.The first beer was the Calice, which is an American style IPA. They say that, at least, but it's far less hoppy than the IPA's that I'm familiar with. Maybe they make that comparison because it was just about as bitter as the IPA's I get at home. At any rate, though it was bitter, it wasn't overpowering, so it was easy to drink. We had a couple of people on the tour who were not drinking, so there was plenty of beer to go around, should we need seconds (and we did need seconds!)The second beer was the Encensoir, which was a smoked beer, and probably my favorite of the night. It was smoky, yes, but not overly smoky. It didn't taste like you were standing downwind of a raging BBQ, which was nice. It was smooth and dark, and paired well with the poutine sampler we were given.The poutine itself was...not my favorite. This was our first time trying it, and had it been up to me, after this sample I wouldn't have tried poutine again anywhere else. The gravy on the fries was good (and that's why our guide had chosen the Encensoir to pair - the smokiness of the beer would pair well with the beefy gravy), but other than that, the dish was kind of meh. The cheese curds dominated the small dish, and that's probably what turned me off to it. Not that I don't like cheese curds, because I do. I just prefer them melted (or so I came to find out).The wait staff was friendly and accommodating, given that three people on the tour had taken it upon themselves to order a full-on meal in the middle of the tour, and then moved tables a couple of times to boot.They have something like 47 beers on tap, and our guide mentioned something else about a staggering number of bottled beers for sale, but it was a long time ago and I was a bit buzzed by then (he was free with the refills, lemmetellya!)We wanted to go back to this restaurant to try their food and sample some of their other draft beers, but we ran out of time. I did enjoy the samples we had, though, and would definitely recommend it for those looking for a wide variety."

Dan and I sat at their bar and ordered a Caesar salad and homemade beer battered onion rings with house made honey mustard. They had over forty beers on tap and let us taste a few before making our decision. Number 1-16 were brewed there. I first ordered a passion sour beer and I think Dan got an IPA The Caesar salad was delicious! The dressing was homemade and it came with real bacon bits. The onion rings were the best we've ever had!! Made with beer brewed there (beer battered) and the house made honey mustard, WOW!! I could see why this restaurant and brewery became busier and busier!! I even had a Kombucha they had on tap (think it was mint citrus). It's the new rage here and Montreal is into the natural probiotics (Kombucha is fermented black and green tea). When we visit Montreal, QC again were definitely going to St. Bock again!!"

Le Saint-Bock did not disappoint. Their milk stout Malédiction is delicious, so I was very happy there. Factor in the beet salad, which is everything a beet salad should be, and the brewer's nachos, and you have a pub that I would happily frequent if I was lucky enough to live in Montreal. There was one blemish on the experience: service. Although I tried to learn some French before my trip, I was too inexperienced to hold meaningful conversations, and I was grateful for the server who could bridge the language gap with her excellent English. Unfortunately, her shift must have ended. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes, signaling with my limited French, trying to get the attention of any of the 5 other staff--who were right in front of us. Finally, another patron next to me intervened. I don't have the impression this is typical of Le Saint-Bock, but consider yourself warned. I was feeling pretty insignificant by the time I left...but wasn't down for long. Walking along Saint Denis in the sunshine is too much fun to stay grumpy. (Having a Malédiction buzz helped, too!)"

We sat down at the bar, and had a number of beers from their long list.  A few of their own brews, as well as a few Belgians.  Having Duchesse de Bourgogne on tap is unusual for many bars. . . they had two different ""vintages"" of it (2016, and 2014).  I had both, though honestly I couldn't tell what the difference was, just that there was a difference.  Either way, everything they had on tap looked good (except for kombucha. . . that just doesn't sound like something I want).  We had some nachos, and a bowl of French onion soup.  Both were good.  The bar staff was friendly, and seemed to answer peoples questions about the beers happily.  They were happy to speak in English for us since our French is horrible/non-existent (we were happy about this, since it seemed that almost everyone there was speaking French).Overall, a great experience with a very good beer selection."

Yes, the beer list was extensive and the beer/cider delicious, but that doesn't make up for the shortcomings.Our server, who was lovely, had clearly been handed too large a section for a busy Saturday(the place was packed) because it took nearly 20mins for someone to bring us menus, and a further 15 to actually meet our server. Then once we ordered food, a 45+ minute wait for  it to arrive, so we had finished our drinks. Our second round never came, I'm assuming the server forgot. Food was fine, but for a wait that long it better be fantastic. My burger was so well done I probably could have played hockey with it, but the poutine on the side was good. My friend enjoyed her mac and cheese, but we  both agreed the wait was just too long and the food nothing special.It's a shame, we were excited to go here."

The waitress approached us and placed some menus on the table.  I greeted her in French, and she asked if we wanted water.  I asked her to repeat herself, and she picked up that we weren't native French speakers.  She asked, ""English?"", to which we replied ""Yes"".  She then PICKED UP THE MENUS SHE HAD JUST PLACED ON THE TABLE, murmured some to herself, and put them back where she found them.  Came back over, TURNED HER BACK TO US and took the order of the table next to us.We left immediately.  I have never experienced such disrespect from wait service.  I know how to travel.  I know that if you are in a city where your native tongue is not spoken, attempting to speak the local language goes a long way.  This we tried and STILL we were disrespected.  Montreal thrives on tourism.  UNBELIEVABLE! But not to worry, we went down the street to L'Amère A Boire and had amazing poutine-fondue and home brews that were excellent (and a cask brew too!).VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET!  Le Saint Bock does not respect their clients, otherwise, they would have taken action on this waitress who has repeatedly been identified as rude and prejudice."

I opted for a number of appetizers-as-tapas to go with the beer. I love Olives, and they were featured. They came warm, which was a surprise, with some seasonings and a few other veggie things. Delicious! I also swung with a Beef Tartare which is hard to find in the USA, due to culinary paranoia. Surprise! I survived. (and it was yummy). I also was advised to get the Poutine, which is a big deal up here. Fries with cheese curds and brown gravy. I'm neither a fan of Fries nor brown gravy, and My folks used to live withing a mile of a deep rural cheesemonger in Wisconsin who made excellent Curds. Sorry, Cher, I can live without Poutine.I had three different Beers, all excellent. Don't remember their names....The company/conversation was better than the food, but still not bad at all..."

I guess because some are do e larger batch vs smaller batch. Here at SB there is an interesting concept for ordering beer. They have an electronic menu board AKA- McDonald's or Tim Hortons that rolls through the different beers. Not really my favourite way as you have to read quickly through the list of ten beers then the page changes. Sure it comes back but I'd declare by conception it was a great idea by utility and functionality it's a bit cumbersome. Maybe I just need more time to peruse a menu. Pints selected were fresh and tasty. No complaints here. We had a table halfway out to the terrace (halfway inside) and my complaint here is that there are way too many tables jammed into a tight space. Just watching the server navigate through the tables made me think ""good lord he's going to dump his tray full of pints on some poor person"". It didn't happen but tables are squeezed in to the max here. Vibe of the place was a bit sterile. We had one pint each and moved on to our next place."

The beer they brewed themselves was awesome and some of the best we tried in the city (we tried over 50 individual beers) and their selection of outside beers was incredible. We had all the poutines except the Calabria sausage one and each one was better than the next. The fried sausage appetizer got ordered accidentally because of the language barrier... but what a happy accident! Nothing I would have ever voluntarily ordered myself but it was delicious! The nacho dishes were pretty awesome too for bar food. I would definitely recommend the poutine with carrots and meat, that was my personal favorite- I believe that was the Duvel one, but literally any one you order will be outstanding.

It's supposed to be loud. The service is a bit slow, even though our server was really nice. The drinks are definitely worth the price (~$6.50 for a Caesar, $7 for a pint) but it's hard to keep a conversation and the atmosphere inside the pub isn't too great.

Some beers come and go from the menu, and it happens sometimes that they run out of some of the beers on the menu.

It gets very crowded at night, and even though tables are packed in pretty tight, we had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table. The beer list is huge with nearly 50 beers, most of which are brewed by them. These beers were excellent from a roasty marshmallow porter which was a bit sweet for me (though it did come with a marshmallow on the side which was cool) to an incredible Belgian trippel that was crisp and clove accented in a fantastic way. The menu is shown on tv screens throughout, just underneath the screens that show hockey whenever it is on. When the Canadiens are playing, they even ring a bell behind the bar for each goal which was fun. The food was pretty good as well. The poutine was made with very tasty fries and melty gooey cheese curd in a succulent thick gravy. The burger was one of the best I've had, surpassing Shake Shack and up there with Black Tap.

A beer lovers heaven! Also they have a beer bible of their bottles to top it all off! I loved their collaborations as well as their house beers - they were top notch. I only gave them four stars tho because unless you're sitting at the bar the service was slow and or non-existent. Also their food was good, but not the best we had in Montreal. Expect upscale but more bar food than gourmet meal (even though they have more gourmet items). We went several times during our trip for drinks and were never disappointed."

The four of us got a large nachos to share (nothing special to the nachos in my opinion) as well as a pint of beer each. I tried the creamsicle which was a place ale and tasted surprisingly like creamsicle! a strong organic undertone and a creamy after taste. Prices for the beers are reasonable as well !

I was impressed by the quality of the cheese curds. Beautiful appearance, and great flavour and chew. The gravy was also well balanced and didn't taste overpowering as some Toronto style poutines tend to be.Service was solid.

Though we did not eat all I hear about during our entire visit from other patrons was, of course, about the Poutine. Their Poutine selection is pretty incredible and if Poutine is your thing than this is your jam. The one thing to bear in mind is that they do a lot of groups of large beer tastings so if you don't want the loud chatter during one of these days you may want to enjoy time out on their patio.

The server helped us pick out a few and all were excellent and fairly priced (especially considering the quality).I found the food offered here to be simple, but really well done  - we ordered a baked Brie with sun dried tomato pesto that was to die for (doesn't sound simple but baked Brie seems to be a common menu item) and I had a really tasty chicken and goat cheese sandwich. Both the fries and the garden salad that accompanied it were also pretty good.Overall we had a fantastic lunch here - great beer, food, and service."

Never having had any of their food, I wouldn't be able to comment. I had the chance to regret not having any.

I walked in and enjoyed the vibe as I witnessed many patrons on by the bar stools, lounge areas and seating areas. I also noticed an out door patio that wasn't being used. The establishment was showing the game on their multiple television screens and broadcast the sound as well. I overall enjoyed the vibe. The host sat us to a table and we were greeted by a waitress in about 3 minutes. Food and Drink: The establishment offers a wide variety of blonds, reds and darks. I ordered a red and was not disappointed with my choice. For my meal I ordered the Duck Burger which was served with fries and green salad. The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted of good quality. I was not disappointed with my order. The duck meat was very tender and the bread it was served on was fresh and soft. The fries were tasty as well, it did not have to much salt, and I enjoyed dipping them in the mayonnaise sauce that came with the plate. The portion was big and very satisfying. Service: The waitress was attentive and very professional. She took her time to translate certain menu items and explain portion size and variety of options. She also asked us what kind of beers we usually like and made great suggestions for our drink choice. Pros: The food quality and portions are worth the price. Cons: I did not note any particular cons on my visit.Overall: I would re-visit this brew pub. The quality of the food is great and it taste delicious. Come early if you are looking to sit down and eat as this place does seem to get crowded after 10 and you may have to wait for seating. This place is easily 3 stars. The 4th star was giving because the duck burger was cooked perfect to my preference. The beer choice ranges and tasting my friends selections as well I was happy with the offerings.

Our waitress was the perfect nighttime patio-sitting attendant, keen and correct, but never pushy. The beers were always right, came at the right temp in tulips, and had a fair price on them (for Canada). I could have done without all the smoking, but this is Canada and apparently smoking is still cool here.

And why is that all the employees just like to stand around the cash register doing nothing while customers are made to wait forever, and ever and ever for one drink??Le Sh*t Bock, you done did it again."

/user_details?userid=auEIdTBTWd2YvVpXmMc8-A,Jim B.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I traveled from the US to Montreal looking for good beer and I found it!Le Saint-Bock is in Montreal's Latin Quarter not far from Le Cheval Blanc, Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère A Boire, and one of the many Les 3 Brasseurs locations. If you're in the mood for live music, mainly blues and rock, there's also Bistro a Jojo; or there's a great scotch selection at Pub L'Ile Noire - both have a decent selection of beer as well.At first glance LSB seem small, but once you pass the outdoor seating area and step inside you'll find that it's actually pretty deep. At night it has very much of a nightclub feel, and the younger crowd seems to thrive on that. Dance music plays and red light glows from beneath the bar, and against the walls. It has a red, black, silver against beechwood decor theme going on. It's slick, but not overly so. Given my druthers, however, I'd prefer to visit during the daytime when it's a little more casual and 'common'.Look for a beer menu and you won't find one, unless you look up on the wall at one of the electronic menu boards they have. The draft list slowly pages through, offering 44 beers on tap including 20 of their own. The brewery, by the way, is tucked all the way in back.I sampled several of the house beers and found them all to be quite good. The guest beers included a few Belgians, a few Americans (two from Stone, Avery's Beast, and something from Moylan's) which was highly unusual, and their Canadian choices were of the finest and most rare from Dieu Du Ciel, Hopfenstark, Microbrasserie du Lac Saint-Jean, Microbrasserie L'Hermite, Microbrasserie Charlevoix, Le Naufrageur, Trois Mousquetaires, Brasseurs Illimités, and Brasserie Franches-Montagnes to name a few. Impressive!They offer food as well, which is mostly basic (although in Montreal where many places offer no food at all or just ""snacks"", this is something special), including soups, salads, sandwiches, nachos and chicken tenders, etc. The prices are slightly pricey given the neighboring competition, but with a few beers in you I doubt you'd consider trekking out to save a dollar or two.Overall I was quite impressed by the beer selection, and I wish I'd gone here immediately (I stayed just up the block but I chose two other close locations to visit in the Quartier Latin and didn't get back until a week later the night before I left for home)."
/user_details?userid=vAp72qVpThC01b4rPnNzVA,Keat Ying C.,"Natick, MA",1 star rating,We went to this place at 9:40pm. The place was busy but not all tables were occupied. We asked for a table for two and was told that they had to re-arrange the tables. We were left standing for 10 minutes while the waiter continued serving other people. Finally got seated and got the menu. Waited until 10:10pm and we were basically ignored. Other tables with big groups got served first. We decided to leave the place and the same waiter who seated us saw us leaving didn't even bother asking us or addressing what the problem was. There are many other good restaurants on the same street. Avoid this if they are busy and if you don't have time to wait

They are super heroes.  The beers were also great.  Didn't try the food.  I'll definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=_GagOZ5oAmNVMt8Z_qH4Kg,Dean P.,"Morrisville, PA",4 star rating,A great place to grab a bite.  My only complaint is that it is a little crowded.  My friends and I have been here many times and it never disappoints.  The food is always reasonable and made to perfection.  The beer selection is good and varied.
/user_details?userid=ywf1G9IvDLg_KytwLimFCw,Scott J.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I like Le Saint Bock; it holds a sentimental place for me, as we started a mini-pub crawl here for my friend's bachelor party.It was a Saturday afternoon and we arrived shortly after the joint opened up at 1 PM.  We sat indoors in large, comfy, black vinyl chairs that faced a wall filled with a variety of colorful beer bottles.  This seating arrangement reminded me of a lounge and was very conducive to accommodate our party of 11 guys.The bartender/waitress was efficient, friendly, and adorable.  She made sure our beer glasses were never empty and brought our fresh nachos and wings plates quickly.The beer selection here is impressive (20 beers on tap) and the light atmosphere was an excellent starting point for a fun-filled day in Montreal.  Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=am8QVk6qjt_TS6l0JMA6pA,Chris G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Love this place. Food is always amazing and the bottle/tap list is always on point. One of the best craft beer bars in Montreal, and a must visit if you enjoy delicious pub grub and sought after craft beers."
/user_details?userid=cumYM_K8wMZZjmrp3tlpRw,Patrick B.,"Merrimack, NH",5 star rating,"Wonderful beers with a varied selection (19 on tap when I stopped in).  Nice patio seating if the weather's nice - and World Cup on the numerous tvs.  Didn't try the food - but what I saw being served looked pretty good.Update:  stopped in again to catch the World Cup and have lunch.  The menu has a good selection of what you'd expect from a bar.  The burger I ordered was quite good and came with a side of fries and a salad.  Ran a tab and paid with a credit card with no problem - not sure why the other reviewer had trouble.  Also, all the beers are cheaper before 7 - and they serve pitchers of most beers."
/user_details?userid=XBwqLcVJ19GRa-mFf3q2iw,Krystle M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"When every other place is full along St. Denis during a Habs game, there always seems to be just enough room in here. One of the less touristy places along the strip I think. Multiple ciders on tab and glutenberg if you're gluten free. Not a ton of GF food options, but the nachos are pretty safe and they are usually pretty nice about food questions even though it's not their specialty."

I stumbled upon this place the other night while on a work trip and came back today because I had time to kill before my flight. I was at the bar less than an hour before realizing that everyone here (including me) is a repeat customer. What a gem! 40+ rotating beers on tap, friendly service, outstanding food (I didn't think anything could beat the pulled pork poutine until I tried the mac&cheese with lardons). My only regret is that I can't fold this place up and take it home. Do NOT miss it."
/user_details?userid=DEBefMdEFFoM9MiYWGm97Q,Conrad S.,"Vienna, Austria",4 star rating,St. Bock just won four medals at the Mondial de la Bière here in Montreal (where I had the honour to be a judge). I went there after the awards event and found the place very inviting. We had a very friendly waitress - much to my surprise she did not understand much English. The problem was solved similarly to what you do in Chinese restaurants: You can order the beers by their number - en francais.

/user_details?userid=E7rEdhFfUm0jQ4I055IOeg,Craige M.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,"Located a few blocks from the Berri-Uquam metro, St. Bock is easily accessable. They have approximately 8 of their own beers on tap, which can be purchased by the pint, glass or taster ($6.50/5.50/1.75). The brown and the porter were our favorites and were good examples of each style. The Scotch ale tasted a bit off. We did not try the food. It is mostly typical pub grub. Nice mellow vibe overall. Definitely seems to attract an over 30 crowd."
