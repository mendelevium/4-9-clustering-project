It was my first time trying out Congolese cuisine and I absolutely loved it. Their menu is not only affordable but quality made authentic items packed with flavour.  I tried: -beef samosas ($6.00-absolutely hit. I love samosa and especially with a crispy Phylo wrap -it went perfect with their house made spicy sauce)-Demi chicken ($11.00 was moist and reminded me of Bangladeshi chicken roast. The overlap in cuisine is so cool from different regions. This chicken was a hit!) This was accompanied by veg rice, sweet plantains, house salad  and fries (ranging from $3.50 to $5.00). I have a weakness for plantains - especially sweet ones, they're like chips I can eat them subconsciously they are so good). For dessert: Congolese beignets sprinkled with icing sugar. These were very filling a few will have you stuffed with comfort.I am really happy to have made this discovery, I look forward to going back !Available on Uber Eats or pick up . 1361 Mont-Royal É."

Le Uptown serves delicious Congolese chicken, among other amazing side dishes. Our family devoured everything so fast! We tried their chicken, beef samosas, plantains, rice, fries and house salad. All of the dishes were delicious but we especially enjoyed the chicken and the samosas! We ended off our meal with some of their yummy donuts (probably the highlight of the night). Be sure to check them out if you're in the mood for some yummy chicken! We had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone!! They're currently available on UberEats, SkiptheDishes and DoorDash, and they do takeout directly from their restaurant location!"
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Congolese cuisine varies widely, representing the food of various part of Central Africa but generally include staple foods including plantains, cassava root, rice, fufu (starchy dumplings) are served buffet style with grilled meats (chicken or fish), stews, greens. Swahili culinary influences can be found in dishes like mandizi fried bread, rice pilaf, and Sambususa (samosas) to name a few.This bring us to Uptown Grill, a trendy Plateau ""resto-bar"" destination for cocktails and weekend vibes in normal times, now offers grilled dishes with an inspired touch of Congo. The pandemic prompted owner Fabrice to review his menu entirely, and with the help of his mother, in-laws and aunties, they focus their efforts on a menu that can be quickly prepared, hold well for deliveries, prepared with traditional Congolese cooking techniques and affordable for local neighbourhood residents!And the result was definite success! The generous meal included a beautifully marinated and seasoned grilled chicken with sides: long grain pilaf rice, caramelized plantains, savoury beef samosas, fried & salad, and cute beignets - a feast fit for a family! Key to the flavour of the chicken is the Uptown sauce made a secret blend of ingredients which I'll guess includes: tomatoes, sweet green peppers, chilies, onions, and aromatic herbs and oils but not matter what it will impart extra flavour to any dish or serve as a great dipping sauce. Stop by and order to go, or call for a delivery, but don't forget the sauce is also available by the bottle!"
