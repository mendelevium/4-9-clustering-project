/user_details?userid=ykuDGEj5J1PKs-0huwiVVg,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Montreal. The food is phenomenal. The interior design is also gorgeous and it was done by a well known local designer named Amlyne Phillips. Whether you sit at the bar or a table you will get an amazing culinary experience. The restaurant is located in downtown Montreal, just off of Phillips Square which is currently undergoing a spectacular renovation. Jatoba also has an interior enclosed terrace which is open all year round so I do recommend you try and get a table in the terrace section as it's the nicest part of the restaurant. If you're driving there's an underground parking lot across the street you can use so you don't have to search on the street. Please support local restaurants during these crazy times. Jatoba still offers take-out throughout this pandemic. You won't be disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Second time we have gone here.. What a gem! From the on point decor to the premium service and absolutely perfectly developed menu. The experience is top notch from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave. Plus there are many vegetarian-friendly dishes!Most recent visit was for my mother's 70th birthday- boy was she ever treated to a special experience. Cannot wait to go back!PS for vegetarians - you must try the eggplant dish! WOW

/user_details?userid=UQFE3BT1rsIYrcDvu_XVow,Mike V.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Lives up to the reputation. The tasting menu is worth every penny, and the drinks are exceptionally well crafted. The service was on point, the ambiance was the perfect balance of trendy without being obnoxious about it. Our last visit we actually dropped in unexpectedly after a prior plan didn't work out, and go figure, we found a table on short notice. Call first, but you'd be surprised."
/user_details?userid=WQepKNQQDOQo1CWpkTUvug,Philip N.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Wow. Every dish was phenomenal. We started with the spicy chicken dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and gyoza - all amazing. The duck fried rice was solid, a good way to add more quantity to the portions. Next, the king oyster mushrooms. These were 100% a must get. The bluefin tuna tartar was outstanding as well. I'd say these were the top two dishes. Loved the black bean beef; melted in your mouth and generous portions. The sweet and sour chicken was very very good too. Overall, highly recommend nearly everything on the menu."
/user_details?userid=w0-8K64pIuKVYPaiWSvNvg,Roxie H.,"Nipomo, CA",5 star rating,I visited Jatoba during a work trip with some colleagues of mine and we were offered a tasting menu from the chef that did not disappoint. The restaurant dubs itself as 'Asian-influenced' and I would say that is accurate. The dining room is very nice with a full bar that boasts an extensive wine list. The plate presentations were wonderful and we were truly wowed by a huge cold platter of sushi that I believe was served as a third course behind some small bites of beef tataki and dumplings. Everything was not only aesthetically pleasing but a treat to eat!
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love restaurants that take you away to a different food realm of fusion, Jatoba is exactly that with a twist on traditional Japanese dishes. Get seated in the indoor garden if you can- to really acquire the true dining experience. Unfortunately, it's fairly difficult to reserve a spot in the garden but our book club members were still content to be dining inside. I love the decor, elegant and sleek. There was so much to choose from on the menu. We decided to go with the tasting menu as suggested by some of the other yelp reviews. For the tasting menu -the items are selected by the chef so you have no idea what you're getting. It came out to around 56$ per person without tax and we sampled 6-7 items which was phenomenal considering the prices are steep for dishes alone. The menu included seasoned baked Brussel sprout leaves, smoked eel papaya mango salad, shrimp dim sum, wild salmon sashimi, a mushroom dish (I can't remember what it was called), sushi spread, sea bass, duck confit with fried rice (the only low point as not standing out as a creative dish). Since I didn't have a copy of the menu I don't have the exact names of the dishes-sorry :/The price of your meal will spike up if you buy cocktails or alcoholic beverages as they average around 16$ each. So I don't think I have to mention with 2 cocktails and the tasting menu -you're looking at an easy 100$+, but so worth it!"

Without reservation, we needed to sit at the bar. The dishes are somehow over priced, because the quantity were not much."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I came here four years ago so My review is a bit outdated and I would like to go back. Entrée: cold somen with sonomono sauce sesame and coriander. In between: Alaskan King crab dumplings with Asian pear salsa and micro basil. Main: jatoba black cod with sautéed vegetables. Desert: red velvet cake with chocolate ganache and green tea ice cream and a delicious cappuccino.Loved this restaurant. Delicious but on the pricey side!Perfect for a date or special occasion
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a 4.5 star review.Jatoba has been on my radar for quite a while now. We finally made it! What a treat for the taste buds and the eyes!!The food was really inspiring. It started with Brussel sprout chips that are simply out of this world! I would seriously entertain the thought of coming here just for these chips - the right mix of spices makes them so appetizing and addictive.Next, we had the gyoza, which was pretty good- they didn't stand out that much.We had the salmon rice, which is akin to a poke bowl. This dish was really good and flavourful.The Jatoba salad was an interesting one; so many different tastes mixed into this bowl.The beef tatami was really amazing! Again, the spices made it come alive.The caramel dessert was delicious. My only complaint was that it was very pricey. I believe about $18 - that is a lot for dessert.Service was very friendly and servers were very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is sophisticated and very trendy. Be ready to people watch in this beautiful setting. It is teeming with a good looking, well heeled crowd.It is quite a scene. Chef Vigneault has a powerhouse restaurant on his hands here that will delight all your senses."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went with a friend a few years ago. We both found it to be expensive for Asian food. We shared the black cod, the dumplings, the beef tataki and the fried rice. We had to order the fried rice because we were still hungry and we needed something to absorb all the alcohol we were drinking. My boyfriend and I went back for a friend's birthday dinner on Saturday. To be honest I wasn't too excited to go back but it ended up being a really good dinner! We had to do the group menu which was a good deal! My boyfriend and I thought we had to pick from the menu to get 5 dishes but we got all 12 dishes for $69 plus tax! The only downside was that we had to share all 12 plates family style instead of each having our own tasting menu. One guy sitting next to us barely ate because he was on the Paleo diet and then two other guys sitting next to us ordered off the group menu so I ended up sharing the plates with only two other people, which was good because otherwise I might have still been hungry at the end of the night.  My boyfriend and I got the bloody Caesar (aka Bloody bull) and Aloha Jatoba cocktail. The Bloody bull was great but I wish it had been spicier. The Aloha contained Tanqueray, Soho, fresh ginger yuzu sweet and sour and lime juice. The waitress said this was their most popular cocktail so I wanted to try it. It was very pretty to look at. It as garnished with a citrus fruit and flowers. However I regretted ordering this because it was too sweet for me. If you like sweet fruity drinks and like Soho (litchi liquor) then you will like this. After the cocktails we stuck with red wine by the glass. Edamame was good! I liked the spices they put on it. It reminded me of the Slap Ya Mama seasoning popular in New Orleans. Next we had the Jatoba salad, salmon tartare served with shrimp chips and beef tataki. The salad reminded me of a Singapore slaw as the vegetables were cut up julienne. The salmon tartare had avocado, sesame seeds and jalapeno peppers on top but it wasn't spicy. It was good! I wish there had been more of it. The beef tataki was delicious. We basically had two pieces each. After that we had the vegetarian dumplings, the chicken, and the yaki-ika (grilled calamari). The dumplings were crispy and were triangular like samossas. It was good but nothing special. Inside the dumpling was an eggplant puree, mushrooms, edamame and corn. When I had the dumplings the first time it was the ox dumplings and they were steamed. The chicken was similar to a general tao. Again it was good but nothing special.Then we had the duck confit fried rice, the filet mignon and the Jatoba style black cod. The duck confit fried rice was good but its just fried rice. I think its good to order rice to fill up on. The filet mignon was tender. Out of the three, the black cod was my favorite. It came with Chinese broccoli. I wish here had been more cod on the plate.The desserts were awesome! One dessert was like s'mores with vanilla ice cream and the second was a chocolate mousse cake with passionfruit sorbet. If you want fine dining in downtown Montreal and like Asian food then this is the place for you! In all honesty, I probably won't come back unless I have to because I do find it expensive for what it is. I recommend going in a group so that you can do the group menu because that is more worth it. Also be sure to predrink and eat a heavier lunch before you come! Ordering off of the regular menu is super expensive! I am half Asian and if I want Asian food I rather just go to chinatown because it's good and it's cheap!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When you are downtown and looking for a more upscale experience then you should definitely consider Jatoba.  This modern looking restaurant boasts an Asian fusion menu.  They have a gorgeous garden terrasse, however because it was booked we were unable to get a seat out there. While it is on the pricier side it is definitely worth the occasional splurge when you're in the mood for a treat.We ordered a tasting menu which gave us a chance to try a bit of everything.  Some of the dishes included confit de canard fried rice, salmon sashimi and dumplings.  While most of the dishes were really well done and tasted excellent I must admit that the fried rice was slightly uninspiring.  That being said they absolutely nailed all the fish dishes.  I found that they were all cooked to perfection.  The tasting menu was about $65 and we sampled 6 different dishes in total so I felt that it was worth it.Our server always made sure that we were well taken care of.  She checked on us often and we never seemed to wait long to receive our dishes.  She was also a really friendly person in general.Jatoba definitely merits a visit if you are in the downtown area and looking for a fine dining experience.  While it may be a little pricy for some I felt that it was fine to pay those kinds of prices once in a while for a meal like that.  I would definitely return here."

Yes, it is pricey but it is worth the treat at least once in a while. We ordered about ten different dishes and everything was absolutely delicious. My personal favourites were the eggplant, the shrimp fried rice (super spicy), and the ox dumplings!The drinks were great, and they were generous with the alcohol.I would definitely recommend Jatoba to anyone who is looking for a great dinner to celebrate a special occasion!!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My foodie group and I had the chance to dine at this establishment located in downtown Montreal on a Friday night and of course, we had reservations on the terrace. It was a dark day and raining hard when we arrived so we were so relieved when we noticed that the terrace is actually covered! The venue is very modern with exposed brick, dark wood tables, a slick bar and chandeliers, but the hanging lights and lots of greenery on the terrace really gave you the feel of the outdoors. The rooftop is actually clear and with all the windows, you'd get all the natural light in if it were a sunny evening; for sure, one of the most gorgeous terraces in Montreal!We shared the tasting menu at 65$ per person and wow, was it well worth it! Four generous courses were served that left us full and content. Some dishes missed the mark like the sweet and sour chicken and the veal, mostly cause they were too dry and tasted more like smoke than anything else. The mango papaya salad and black cod dish were fabulous though, as were the cocktails. I had a spicy pimm's cocktail with wasabi and lemongrass which had the right combo of heat and sweet. Worth mentioning was the cheesecake dessert which came with a wasabi ice cream; the combo was good but not my thing although that cheesecake was fluffy heaven! The service was excellent as the staff was both personable and friendly, although there was a small wait between the second and third service. I'd totally return to the terrace on a sunny day to try some dishes from their a la carte menu and enjoy some of the lovely selections from the wine list; it was a memorable evening overall!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you like japanese food and suddenly feel fancy, this is the place for you. The food is fresh and the combination of the ingredients is nicely done. The best dishes i've had is the black cod and i've never had any other black cod like this elsewhere. It melts in your mouth as soon as you eat it and it has this nice subtile miso flavor. The staff is very friendly and helpful in choosing on what to order. The ambience is nice. The chef personally came to our table to explain the different kinds of fish on our sashimi platter. Althought it is quite pricey, every dish is definitely worth it once in a while."
/user_details?userid=6lELxb5duHs0u9C0oNkXtw,Farah S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Was highly eager to try Jatoba. It was ok but really more of a hip place with younger & business crowd and a scene of see & be seen than a foodie place. The patio is nice & service was great but the food was just ok. We had the Gyoza which was ok , really can get better in some Izakaya places. The highly anticipated & raved about Sashimi plate also fell short comparing to other good Japanese restos in Montreal.The Maki was really so so and over priced. We also found the Jatoba Cod to be overly sweet. Usually the Miso black cod is one of my favourite foods but here the sweetness just over powered the taste. We really liked the scallops which were very well executed with a tasty creamy mushroom sauce. The lobster was good but again nothing mind blowing. I think the originality was mainly apparent in deserts and top marks go to caramel dream and the cheese cake mousse."
/user_details?userid=gdZRGQoskfqapck_hL70hA,Kim P.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This restaurant was definitely a little bit on the fancier side of things, but definitely worth trying. The way their menu was set up was kind of tapa style, so my friends and I got a couple of dishes (not all pictured).Their sashimi was definitely so fresh! Every piece I ate, I did not taste the fishiness at all and usually some restaurants don't clean their fish well enough, so there's still that fishiness taste to it, but Jatoba really did it well. Every piece melted in my mouth and it was well worth the price. I think our all time favorite dish was the fish. The sauce and seasoning of it was just so well done! We could not get enough off it. We also got duck fried rice, which was amazing! It may sound really simple, but it was so well done, definitely could go for more. The dessert was absolutely amazing. The Japanese cheesecake with jasmine milk tea ice cream was AMAZING. I would go back just for that, that's how good it is lol. Overall, every dish we ordered was amazing and we would definitely come back for it.Now, the only complaint I have is that our waiter forgot one of our orders AND misplaced someone else's order at our table. I'm giving Jatoba five stars for the food, but four stars for their service. Granted, our waiter was very patient with us, but when we repeated our order to him a few times, he still forgot one of our dishes. Usually that's not a big deal for me, but in this case we were visiting from out of the country and we really wanted to try what we ordered (but wasn't delivered). In any case, I'd still be willing to come back and hope that our next waiter/waitress doesn't forgot our orders!"

I highly recommend the wok duck confit, the chirashi (basically a big bowl of sashimi!). Most recently I had one of their new items on their menu- the 5 spice chicken bao. The chicken was good but they haven't completely nailed the bao bun yet; it was thinner than it should be IMO!Also keep it mind that the prices are pretty high for the portions you're getting! I brought my boyfriend here once and after 3 dishes he still needed a second dinner!Overall, very good asian fusion with a beautiful interior."
/user_details?userid=emClTWXE_ou1_RJ5PHIAUQ,Iris N.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"Too expensive for the quality of food... Maybe just this time but it was my first time so I'm just giving a review based on what I ate... The service and ambiance were great. Not the food.I had the most expensive HaGao in my life and also the worst. Very little shrimp in it and the outer layer is way too thick. Doesn't taste  fresh at all. The sashimi bowl I order was expensive as well and not as fresh as I thought it would be. The fish is cut very thinly which is fine but they don't have the sashimi taste. The ""marinated"" vegetables that come with the sashimi was just shredded carrots and reddish.. I had way better sashimi bowl for a better price."

Expect to have to walk out of there with a bill of at least 50$ if you want to be full. At lunch, they have lunch ""specials"". Their sashimi platter is actually pretty decent ($$$).  For dinner, I tried many of their dishes and they are all on point (black cod,   scallops, etc.). Their cocktails are good."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Jatoba is beautiful inside, chic yet comfortable decor with attentive friendly service and very high quality food. It is a tapas/sharing style restaurant so our table ordered various items to share.  To start I ordered their Aloha Jatoba cocktail and it was perfection, so well balanced and perfectly prepartion and presentation (not too sweet and not too strong tasting). We had the Gyoza dumplings as well as another set of dumplings (also with shrimp, I dont remember the name), they were both very tasty with a great balance of filling and great texture on the dumpling dough.  The beef tataki melted in our mouths , as did the salmon sashimi , they were soooo soooo good ! We also had the grilled seabass with tempura veggies , this was my least favourite but it still tasted great !  The Duck Bao buns were excellent , a little sweetness to them without being too much and the duck inside was juicy without being too fatty.  For dessert we had the matcha cake (This was just okay ,it says it has a gooey oozing filling but it didnt and the flavour was pretty ordinary, although the raspberry sorbet on the plate was excellent), the Caramel cake was the star , everything about it was perfect - it had a salty sweet feel to it and had some nice texture, the sorbet on the plate that came with it was also amazing ! This was by far my favorite of the two desserts. My one criticism is how very expensive this place is , especially for tapas- the quality and experience/service  are both very much there and on point but the prices are still pretty high in my opinion for what it is at the end of the day. This is more of a special occasion restaurant as opposed to somewhere to go on a regular dinner or date."

I took 2 drinks, both delish and with a nice amount of alcohol! Now for the food, loved the dumplings and tartare. Salad was ok and served with eel which I didn't see on the menu. Sashimi was excellent. Great option for a celebration or if u have a good amount of money to spend!!!  enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=Pxtz00WgmEBalguNqSjKYQ,Isabella C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"Ok food, very good service. I had the Tataki boeuf which was 6 thin slices of beef with crispy carbs and some cooked beans and sprouts. The beef had almost no flavor- actually, nothing had much flavor excerpt for the meager amount of truffle sauce that was on the bottom of the plate. Very underwhelming. We then had the salade jatoba, which was basically fresh vegetables very thinly sliced, drizzled with a light sauce. We also had the ultra gyozas, filled with shrimp and crab, but again, had almost no flavor. The only thing that tasted great was the le mille-crepes, which was 21 layers of crepes with a light cream in between each layer. The restaurant itself was gorgeous, but the food was nothing to rave about."

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been going to Jatoba pretty regularly for lunch over the summer. This restaurant has one of the nicest terraces in the downtown area. In fact the decor and atmosphere of the entire restaurant, both inside and out, is A+. Whether it is for a quick business lunch or to chill out on the terrace in the afternoon you can't go wrong here.Everything on the menu is pretty solid and the presentation is great. If I had to pick out one standout main dish it would certainly be the cod. It is excellently prepared and melts in your mouth. However, the real highlights on their menu are the desserts. Oh my god each one that I have seen or tasted is amazing. The portions are enormous so plan to share and they are rich and just out of this world. Take the chocolate bomb for example, someone has posted a video of this. Yes, this menu item is so amazing and interactive it requires a video.  Upon arrival at your table the server will pour hot chocolate melting a chocolate sphere containing more chocolate and fruity goodness. Forget the main course just go straight for the dessert, you won't be disappointed. In all honesty, even if it wasn't for the desserts I would comeback just for the terrace, there is nowhere else downtown with such a nice outdoor space."

The ambiance was perfect - lights just right, music at ideal volume, plants & furniture were classy and comfortable. It's the kind of place you want to just linger and enjoy your meal. Which is exactly what we did! We had the group menu for $65 and the courses kept coming and coming. The first course was my favorite but they all had some outstanding dishes. The spicy salmon tartare and beef tataki were excellent, as was Jatoba's black cod. Would i try wasabe ice cream again? Probably not, but pairing it with the cheesecake was an interesting experience. I also enjoyed my Spicy Foo Pimm's Cup cocktail. The service was also first rate. An entirely charming experience!"

The buns were good but for the price of $28 (for 2 small buns) my mind should have been blown and they were only alright. The salad missed the mark for me.

Went here for a special occasion dinner, which my husband had mentioned while making the reservation. We showed up on time and the hostess showed us to our table. Nobody came to our table with even water. After 10 minutes, we asked for a server and menu. The entire time we were there, we were struggling to get our server's attention. It turned out he was a bartender, which explained why he wasn't very happy serving us. After 30 minutes, he finally took our order. We got our drinks in 15 minutes and first round of food in another 20 minutes. Then we had to wait for another 30 minutes to get our remaining order. The food was good. Drinks were good as well. Don't know what was up with so much wait because they were not busy. At this point I was getting restless and just wanted to finish eating and leave. It was quite late for a weeknight dinner. Finally finished eating and waited to ask for the bill. 15 minutes later, we managed to a get a server's attention and requested the bill. Got the bill in few minutes this time, paid and left. I had three restaurant options for that night but I decided to check this place out, which I believe was a mistake. It actually took us more than 2 hours here. Despite of mentioning that we were celebrating a special occasion, the service was horrible. Also, there was no apology whatsoever. I would like to check out their Terrasse  for drinks only but would not go here for food again because of the long wait."

The decor is very pretty/sexy. Waitresses wear cute dresses with belt bags. We were told the menu was designed to share. However we were somewhat disappointed to see the portions were quite small and my friend and I were both still a little hungry after our meal but not excited enough to order more. We started with the dumplings. MehhhhNext up was the mango salad. Delish but really for one person. Tuna tataki which was crusted in Tempura and not much flavor. Tempura is not my favorite so maybe don't trust me if you love it. But the tuna was bland. And our entree was the Lamb dish. Tastes but they took our spoons and it is not a dish that you can eat with chopsticks. I think we needed rice or something but couldn't wrap our heads around the double digit price. The waitress assured us we had enough but it wasn't. It gets very crowded, loud and tight in space."

We ate it all and it was the freshest we have had in a long time.  Lovely.  We also shared the gyoza dumplings which were good.  My meal was the black cod, melt in your mouth emigrant fish paired with a recommended red wine from the waiter.  Just delightful!

/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"Disclaimer: I came here with a friend for a catch up lunch so my comments only apply for the lunch service. The pros: Very nice setting for a business lunch if you work in the area. They have both indoor and a shaded outdoor setting options. Good option if you are looking for a healthy meal as more than half the menu boasts fresh fish in some variation. The cons: Service a bit on the slower side of you are in a hurry. It took almost 30 minutes between our salad and main course. This can be an issue if you have a restricted lunch timeframe. The food was very decent, good quality produce; definitely no complaints there. However it's rather on the pricier side. 36$ for 12 pieces of sashimi with some rather plain veggies is a bit on an overkill in my books. For the same price you could have gotten the sashimi omakase at Park sushi, which comes with 3 different serving sauces and a more generous portion of sashimi. Granted the location in core downtown comes with a price hike but price ratio still doesn't balance well once that factored in. If you can expense a 100$+ lunch meal on company tab than by all means this is a good place to get good quality food and impress a client. If it's just to catch up with a friend, I'd pick somewhere else."

We had the pork collar & the chirashi. The meat was so tender and tasteful! Since the terrace is covered, we can enjoy its ambiance whether is raining or not. I would recommend this place for 5à7 or big events."
/user_details?userid=t-0_us3OTzs_ZhKy6fcamg,Dawn M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Beautiful space, beautiful presentation of the food, great service, very good quality ingredients, not super authentic (not that it matters as long as the food is good), and very, very pricey. The menu is eclectic, more Asian fusion than actually Japanese. We had the sashimi platter daily special and the coconut rice with grilled shrimp. We had about three glasses of wine and a mixed drink between us, and we shared a dessert. All of this came to $202ish before gratuity. The sashimi was fresh and served with all kinds of interesting, pretty, and edible herbs/flowers/plants. It was exquisitely arranged on a bed of ice, very fresh and tasty. A good variety of fish I might not have otherwise chosen, because when I order à la carte I tend to stick to my usual faves. Interestingly, it was served with a sweet soy sauce as opposed to the type you'd normally get with sashimi/sushi. In fact, it tasted almost like Chinese clay pot rice (煲仔飯) soy sauce, because it was sweetish. The coconut rice was delicious and fragrant but overcooked (or rather, cooked with too much liquid). My grandpa would probably rave about it. The shrimp was decent but probably brined in baking soda to make the meat springier - I'd prefer untreated shrimp. The rice was a little bland, to be honest. Drinks were good. The highlight was the dessert for sure. My dining companion told me they had an amazing dessert chef and he was right!!! I'm glad it was so good too, because the desserts were on average $18 each before tax and gratuity. We had this caramel concoction - two tender, fragrant, thin layers of warm cake with some warm caramel stuff in the middle, topped with The Best Vanilla Ice Cream I'd Ever Had. The ice cream was HEAVENLY. It was generously dotted with vanilla beans and the flavour was so pure and vanilla-y, just the right amount of sweetness, and the difference in temperature went so perfectly with the warm cake under it. We were told it's one of their bestsellers and I can see why - I will be fantasizing about it for a long time!"

/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I should have given it a 4.5 star because it is almost as good as it could get for Asian fusion cuisine in Montreal, not to mention the amazing decor and beautiful terrace (perfect for fancy office party/networking event). The only reason i removed 1 star was probably due to the portion. My husband left a business lunch there hungry and didn't wanna go back until i insisted- then we were both pleasantly surprised at dinner: the Lobster dish comes with a complimentary shanghai bok choy and it reminds me of some top Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong (price was even higher). The gratin with king oyster mushroom is creative and tasty - a must-have! The other dishes like fried rice (only filling dish you could order), crispy tofu, salmon tartare are a bit less memorable but definitely still good. tips: do 2 plates per person+dessert or 3 plates/person if you have light items like salad/tofu.It's pricy but totally worth it .

I was sceptical about the duck fried rice at the beginning (my friend wanted to order that so we went ahead), but wow, I was so impressed with it. The fried rice was so tasty! The beef tataki really melted in my mouth (my favourite of the night)! The combination of cider vinegar, sesame oil and sonomono sauce was amazing! Everything was light but so delicious.I really enjoyed the ambiance too - it's trendy and somewhat fancy. I think it's a great place for a date or a small gathering.

December 2015 was the first time I stepped foot at Jatoba; ever since, I've been back countless times (but to my lack of initiative, never took the time to review it). So... truth is, Jatoba is an extraordinary blend of culture, food, hand-crafted drinks, ambiance, and art. Chef Olivier Vigneault & his team present a truly unique Asian fusion concept (with a Montreal flair of course) whereby the freshness of each ingredient (especially the sashimi) hits your palate at about 120 km/hr. Whenever I have a guest visiting from out of town, this is my restaurant of choice. A truly experiential dining adventure worth the trek, but be sure to make a reservation. Genuine gratefulness to the Jatoba team for the hospitality, and we'll see you again soon!"

Everything on the menu is really well thought out. The black cod was the best I have ever had. Period. It just melted in my mouth.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When one talks about dining in Montreal, we rarely talk about the downtown core as a big part of that. There are definitely places worth checking out that are more than simply overpriced fare for the business crowd. One of these is Jatoba. Located in Phillips Square, Jatoba is a project headed by chef Olivier Vigneault, previously a sous-chef for Antonio Park.The space, conceived by La Chambre Design, is a beautiful combination of the old brownstone structure with some more modern touches. I love how they incorporate the brick facades all around the different rooms and make them focal points. The lighting is ample but slightly dimmed to create a nice intimate feel. Lots of wood warms up the space and the kitchen is exposed in the big backroom. The other big element is the use of tons of plant life to incorporate some nature into the space. The whole of the restaurant feels very warm and cozy.Jatoba has a pretty good cocktail menu and wine list. I started with a Lavender May - Lot 40, lavender and calico syrup, fresh lime juice, egg white, rhubarb bitters. I love egg white cocktails so this was an easy sell for me. Not too floral with a nice touch of both sweet and sour. The frothy texture of the egg white added some body to it as well. As for the wine, for the purpose of full disclosure, I know the sommelier of Jatoba - an old high school friend - so with his advice, we were treated to a lovely French Patrimonio that we had never heard of. Just the fact he got my parents to like a French wine is worth very high praise. Thanks Marc-Andre!Food-wise, given the pedigree of the chef, you can imagine that the menu is Asian-inspired fusion fare. As a group of 5, we were able to share numerous items. First up, I can never say no to a bowl of edamame with yusuf powder, nanami togarashi and fleur de sel. Always love that salty kick.We also tried the Brussel sprout chips with spices. Very thinly sliced and fried up, I personally loved the slightly bitter notes from the sprouts and the crunch that came from frying them.Next up, we went for some dumplings. We tried three varieties - the Gyoza (pork, shrimp, chinese chives, spicy samba oelek soy and chinese vinegar), the Tori (chicken, napa cabbage, braised shiitakes, leek and sonomono sauce) and the Ha Gao (shrimp, green onion and red wine tobiko). All excellent - very flavourful with the subtle hints of the extra ingredients above the primary proteins. Kind of made me crave some true Dim Sum at that point....My girlfriend and I felt like a soup so we shared the lemongrass soup - lemongrass and coconut cream, shrimp, lobster, tomatoes, thai basil, green onions and bamboo. A lovely well balanced soup. The lemongrass was strong but the sweetness of the coconut cream softened it slightly and created a super silky texture. The addition of shrimp and lobster gave it some more heft and the tomatoes brought some freshness and tanginess. One of the best soups I've had in a while.As a rice dish, we went with the fried rice with duck confit which included an egg, vegetable medley, yukon gold chips, green onions, micro coriander and enoki mushrooms. Very generous portion of rice and lovely flavours all around. The rice had the crunch of a fried rice with some earthy notes. The addition of the duck confit provided a nice rich and fatty contrast to the rest of the rice dish.Next up was sushi time. We went with The Roll - atlantic salmon, spicy hamachi, avocado, cucumber, tempura flakes, sweet soy and yusuf yogourt. A more upscale version of a classic ""Kamikaze"" roll and excellent all around. Key differentiation was the use of less of the binding elements like the tempura and more emphasis of the freshness of the salmon. The fish was beautiful and came through clearly within the roll. No hiding of the fish here. The tempura brought a touch of crunch and I liked the touch of sweet creaminess coming from the yogourt.The final savoury dish we tried was the 1855 Beef Tataki seared with sesame oil, mini green beans with cider vinegar, dwarf truffle peaches, black quinoa soufflé and sonomono sauce. Beautiful elegant dish - the beef was sliced beautifully thin and super tender. The addition elements simply play to augment the natural flavours of the beef.For dessert, we got the Chocolate Bomb and the Japanese cheesecake. The bomb - a combination of black and white triple chocolate brownie with hazelnut praline, dark chocolate and hazelnut truffle, dark chocolate mousse, marbled chocolate sphere and milk chocolate sauce - was a chocolate overload in all the best ways possible. I loved the different uses of texture and flavours within all the chocolate. The cheesecake served with maple spongy candy and black sesame ice cream was excellent texture-wise. Nice and creamy. The black sesame ice cream was not my thing but a cool pairing to the inherent richness and creaminess of the cake.Jatoba was a lovely night out - wonderful drinks, awesome service and good food."

The menu is enormous and the ideia is to share so you get to taste many different options. I strongly suggest their cocktails. My friends and I each had a different one and all were amazing!

Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave great tips about what to order.

The rice was a very simple, unimpressive dish that was definitely not worth $18.The service was mediocre at best. After the meal, our waiter disappeared. It took another wauter 20 minutes  to ask if we wanted a dessert. No one from the staff asked how our experience was.Save yourself the expense and the disappointment and avoid this restaurant."

The fish melted in your mouth it was so fresh and good. I also loved the fact that everything on the platter was edible. We had a sweet and sour chicken dish that was ok but not as top notch as the rest of the meal. The beef tataki was terrific with excellent flavor and was like butter. The black cod was over the top spectacular. The fish was cooked to perfection glistening as you cut into it. We had an amazing meal here and will be a go to spot for me when I am back in town.

As we were getting our coats back from coat check and ordering a Uber the manager (short woman with short red hair) came over and was visibly upset at our mere existence. We told her we understood the private event and were getting our things back to go to which she raised her voice another octave and insisted we leave this instant and put our coats back on outside in the rain/snow. So we trudged back outside and on the way out she made sure to tell her staff not to let us back for any reason...  you would think she thought we were Jason Bourne on a life long mission to crash their restaurant. Mind you this was in the front coat room and foyer area where we saw no attendees. Will make it a point to tell others to avoid this place.

I've met Chef Olivier Vigneault when I used to work for an upscale sushi restaurant Kaizen, where I remembered how fantastic his cooking was. When I saw he's at Jatoba, I was sold.Good: We've ordered the vegetarian gyoza (dumplings), the daikon with fresh herbs and spicy beef salad, and the 1855 beef tataki to share. The service was fantastic, and the food had totally exceeded my expectations. The complex flavours of each dish was simply amazing. I highly recommend the daikon salad, it's really light, filling and flavourful. You know the food is great when you can't decide which dish was your favourite because everything was so tasty.  Now, I had recently returned from a trip in Japan, so my expectations have been lowered for all Japanese restaurants in Canada (sorry), but having tried the sashimi at Jatoba, I was instantly reliving my Japan trip all over again. Each bite was so fresh with delicate flavours, you would slowly savour it. That's how good it was.Bad: We didn't get a seat the terrace, but it was our fault we didn't reserve in advance.Bottom line: This is among my top 5 picks in Montreal. I would recommend this place for anyone in a heart beat. If you still need more convincing to try this place, just look at Chef Olivier Vigneault's Instagram account."

/user_details?userid=GMhCq90wV2zlidFfIduTOA,Donna M.,"Newton, MA",4 star rating,"Dined here on July 28. Overall, it was lovely and definitely would return! Food: Note that most of the items are very small. If you like to eat and have a hearty appetite like my husband and I do, be prepared to buy many different things. We got the GaI Gao dumplings ($16) to start which were very good. You only get 5, but if you are a party of two, they offer to give you a 6th which is great. However, we didn't know until we got the bill that they charge you $4 for the extra dumpling! I thought that was pricey. We then got Yaki Tori chicken ($24) - again, extremely tiny portions, only 4 small skewers which we ate in a heartbeat. Along with that, the steamed rice and vegetables with chopped pork were very good, both sizes were reasonable for two. After all of this, we were relatively full but had room for dessert. YOU MUST GET the dish with the marshmallow and ?blondie with ice cream. It's seriously one of the best desserts I have ever had !!!  What a great way to end the meal. Drinks: got two rounds of Aloha Jatobas. Very tasty and beautifully presented. However, the first round didn't taste like it had much booze in it which was a downer. The second round did, which made me question if there was any alcohol in the first drink at all. I wanted to get a third round because it was so refreshing, but at $14 a pop, it was getting expensive! Atmosphere: kinda has a retro vibe with plants and geometric figures on shelving. Very cozy and comfortable. We has hopes of sitting on the terrace but we were seated inside so I can't speak to the outside. Service: very good, attentive, sweet. TL;DR: pricey but worth it"

The red velvet dessert was jaw-dropping. The service was also extremely lovely and overall very caring to our needs.

I saw decent portioned plates but ours were not. Presentation was beautiful. The ambience is pretty. Sound level loud. Tables very deep, creating a large distance between you and dinner partner - we had to speak in raised voices, adding to the loud din. Beautiful people. The saviour of the meal was the dessert.

A great style of Japanese food with a North American flare!The restaurant is located on a quite street just minutes away from Old Montreal. It look a bit of looking since the restaurant is slight hidden. The incredible decor reminds you of dining in someone's backyard. The slight upscale feel and the dim lighting sets the mood for the dining experience ahead.Their five spice old fashion is really something else, a mix of bourbon and five spice mix gives the cocktail a unique flavor. The kumquat balances out the anise flavor to create a delicious mix.The must have is the kampachi, a great blend of fresh kampachi fish with the spicy flavours of wasabi and jalapenos. A must try at the restaurant, my only complaint is the fact there wasn't more of it!I'd definiately come back for sure next   time i'm in town!"

/user_details?userid=PghVeuONyc4XGr6_5pERqA,Christopher L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Elevated form of Japanese cuisine. Didn't have any of the gimmicks you usually find with fusion foods but gravitated towards a more elegant and contemporary taste that reflected all the traditional Japanese ingredients. Beef tataki and ox-tail dumplings are must haves.
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Really disappointed by this experience. Probably the worst ""high-end restaurant"" I've been to. The fish and meat were great. We had bluefin tataki, salmon tartare, filet mignon and sea bass; they were all fresh and delicious. However, the Alaskan crab was a too salty for my taste and the tempura shrimp had too much batter. We also had many types of dumplings, the only memorable one being the Hao Gao. You can find tastier dumplings for half the price in Chinatown though. The salads were okay, nothing to write home about. The vegetable sides often lacked seasoning and were bland. I had the Japanese cheesecake for dessert, which you should avoid. The cheesecake was dry and crumbly, nothing like the Japanese style. The accompanying wasabi ice cream was very out of place (and frankly, the taste was just off). Having pieces of maple toffee was nice though. Not sure how they fit in the plate, but at least they were good. Now you may be reading this and thinking, ""Wow, isn't she picky!"". But I think that when you're paying so much per plate (and keep in mind that the portions were tapa-sized), quality needs to follow suit. Now the service. For starters, our waiter left abruptly in the middle of taking our table's order, without excusing himself or anything. He did come back 5 minutes later, but this would be a preface to the overall rudeness of the service. Someone came over to take away our wine glasses without even asking us if we'd like anything to drink. Our plates were later taken away from the table even though they were clearly unfinished. Moreover, it was a rainy evening, and we were sitting in the veranda area; water was leaking through the roof and splashing on one end of the table, also bothering my friend in the process. The waiter came by, looked up to the ceiling with annoyance, and did absolutely *nothing*. No offer to move the table out of the dribbling water, and not even an apology. Seriously? We had to scoot over ourselves. Fix your roof, Jatoba."

/user_details?userid=09maL_m5yM-2RwPf9DW0Sg,John H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2 star rating,"Jatoba is the much hyped addition to downtown Montreal. Located inside a large building without an obvious signs, the restaurant is vast with a beautiful terrace out back.  The decor and ambiance are very nice and welcoming.  The service is excellent with no less than 3 people waiting on your table.  I would give it 5 stars just for the service and decor.  The food is what brings this place down.  We ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings to start.  They were mediocre at best. There are better, more authentic dumplings anywhere in Chinatown but again, you won't get the nice terrace or a server wiping down your table mid meal.The brussell sprout chips were my favorite. They were light an crispy but fell short of anything more than a snack.  Finally, out starters ended with a very very disappointing seaweed salad.  The dressing was bland and lacked the traditional seaweed salad found in almost all of the Japanese restaurants in the area.  I ordered the chicken and my colleague ordered the sea bass as our mains.  My chicken was 2 skewers of dry chunks of chicken in a mysterious brown sauce.  For $24, I would expect an actual piece of chicken with crispy skin (as described in the menu).  This was almost inedible.  The bass was good with large chunks of tomato. The vegetable fried rice was disgusting.  Broken grains of rice in what looked like a mixture of rice and frozen peas.  There was no flavor and the rice was dry.  I'm not sure what this place is aiming for because it's not quite Asian.  The venue is gorgeous but the food is terrible.  There are many other options for fine Asian fusion in MTL and this is not one of them."
/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Sometimes in life you find something as close to perfection as you could imagine. Our visit to Jatoba was beyond our wildest imaginations and served up a perfect meal. A delicious menu of steak and seafood influenced by an Asian flare, Chef Olivier Vigneault presents patrons with a modern take on both traditional and not so traditional dishes.Located on Place Phillips, Jatoba borders both the downtown shopping district and the opening to the old port of Montreal. The establishment has a very modern feel, with open spaces and a high ceilings. A good sized patio is available for summer dining, but for us it was decorated for the holiday season. The staff was attentive and accommodating and made sure all of our needs were attended to. From the coat check, to the waitstaff to Chef Olivier Vigneault himself, everyone at Jatoba make sure all guests have the best dining experience in Montreal.It was decided we would dine at the bar, this gave us the opportunity to observe the restaurant from afar and absorb the ambiance in full. Since we were already seated at the bar, cocktails were requited. We started with a five spice old fashioned and a maracuya martini, both endorsed by our attentive host for the evening Shima.  Drinks in hand it was time to dive into the menu. With so many choices and decisions, we wanted to try everything. Graciously Shima took the reigns and chose the dishes for us. To enhance our refreshments we sampled the spiced brussels sprout chips, crispy and tasty it was a nice start to our meal.Once we had our appetites awakened, we eagerly awaited the rest of our meal. Glass of wine in hand, having finished the cocktails, before us was placed a dish of kampachi sashimi. For the first time ever, we have no words to describe a  dish, simply put this is something you have to try as words cannot do it justice.Unsure how Jatoba would top this offering we waited anxiously, we were not disappointed. The 1855 beef tataki seared in sesame oil, was perfectly complemented with mini green beans, puffed black quinoa, truffle peaches and a sonomono sauce. Between courses we enjoyed a hearty bowl of edamame sprinkled with yuzu powder, nanami togarashi and fleur de sel. As we all know the best accompaniment to any Asian meal is edamame.The dumplings arrived as two separate dishes. the spiced oxtail was served after being braised for 12 hours, and attended by granny-smith apple, caramelized onions, jalapeno and micro cilantro, with yuzu beef stock. We wholeheartedly agree that this was the best oxtail we have ever tasted. The more traditional Gyoza dumplings, stuffed with pork, shrimp,Chinese chives, served with a side of Chinese vinegar and sambal oelek soya sauce for dipping, were almost too beautiful to eat. The dumplings were quickly followed by the oysters au gratin and rabbit congee. Being fans of raw bars in the past we tended to avoid cooked oysters, but this will no longer be the case. These oysters were perfectly prepared and thoroughly enjoyed. The rabbit was served atop a crispy youtiao and topped with puffed rice, green onions, uzura and micro cilantro. We think it would be safe to say the rabbit never tasted so good. Our final dinner dish was a combination of three separate plates but went together as if they were destined to do so, Jatoba black cod, king oyster mushrooms and fried rice with duck confit. The cod served over sauteed vegetables and celery root puree melted in our mouths as each bite. The fried rice with duck confit was ideally seasoned and was a wonderful twist on the traditional chicken fried rice. Finally the king oyster mushrooms in a sweet miso gratin, this was beyond any doubt our favorite dish of the night. We guess Chef Vigneault saved the best for last. No meal can ever be complete without a sampling of afters. We were so pleased Shima was designing our menu, because there was no way we were going to be able to decide on one dessert. What a delight to be served the chocolate bomb with passion fruit sorbet on the side. The bomb is served as a sphere and covered with a generous portion of hot chocolate. As the bomb melts away it reveals orange yogurt cake with white chocolate mousse. Just for the record, yes it tastes as good as it sounds.We would like to thank the entire Jatoba team for sharing their delightful menu with us. It is a remarkable establishment serving Montreal a most memorable experience."

Not only was the service practically non existent, the food was terrible. Presentation wise the food looked incredible, unfortunately that was its only redeeming quality; it was practically flavorless. I'm glad we pulled the plug before being disappointed further. We were given a table and once we settled in we were moved. Then we waited for quite a while before an absolutely unenthused server asked us ""sup?"". Then the waiting game began anew, once we finally got a drink the waiting started again to place an order. Had the quality of the food redeemed the distain we felt as customers it might have been ok. We were in town for our 20th anniversary and felt completely unimportant/unwanted as customers. We felt like we were putting them out by being there, and we had booked weeks in advance on the advice of a friend who lived there. My advise is to avoid this place at all cost."

They have limited options of wine by the glass and there are not enough employees in the dining room to accommodate their guests.

We had a side of duck fried rice which was super good.This may sound like a of food for a table of four but the portions are fair but a bit petite.  So there was abdominal space left for desserts which just happened to be the highlight of the evening. A chocolate bombethat  was the bomb;and a rendition of the ever popular red velvet cake which was more like a heavenly mousse than a gateaux. Bottom line: it looked and tasted sensational..ly. Hats off to the pastry chef.Jatoba has a very extensive and pricey wine list from which we chose an excellent Oregon Pinot Noir(hard to find in Montreal where there is  a huge but understandable bias toward French wines. I would have  liked to see more bottles in the $40-60 range because the next steps up appeared @ $80 -$100 and way more$$$.All in Jatoba is doing  most things right and its a great place for a fun , festive and may I add priceydinner.5 stars are waiting if they kick they food up a notch or two."

We shared dumplings as appetizers - the shrimp were good, the crab/avocado, outstanding. I had the black cod as my main course choosing that based on yelp reviews/photos. It was a standout meal! The cod was perfectly cooked and broke apart in huge, perfectly uniform flakes. It sat on a delicious veg puree with onion, zucchini, and some other green vegetable. We had a lovely chablis with our meal and stuck with that all evening. Because the meal was excellent we shared a few desserts. I can't recall every one of them but they were all excellent. One was the green tea maki and it was like a sponge cake had been soaked in green tea and then rolled around fresh berries and served with a side of tart sorbet. Perfect ending to a meal!  The service was good as well and the manager even came by to ask us if we were satisfied. The answer was a resounding ""Yes"".

If there is one thing I know about... Its food. I've been to the best restaurants all over the world, but I have never seen such an unprofessional person in my life! We were 5 people and our bill was around 650$ with tip. I can agree that most of the food was good... But their raw fish is absolutely discusting. It tasted soooooo fishy and when i brought this to their attention i was told that this manager was going to come and speak to us but he never did because he was too lazy to get up and do his job properly. And when i saw that they didnt remove these items that didnt even add up to 45$ off the insane bill I was shocked. They didnt even appologize. In fact, the manager argued with me and told me that I didnt know what I was talking about... Even when 5 other people agreed that the fish was DISCUSTING AND FISHY. He also told us he didnt care if we come back or not. Clearly this guy has no idea how to treat his clients and doesnt value his customers. Ive been to hundreds if restaurants and I am not one to complain or even write a review, but This was inevitable. Even at cheap restaurants if you dont likee something they take it off the bill because they want you to be happy or at least they offer you a drink or dessert. This guy is so money hugry he was more worried about removing 45$ than thinking of what great clients we could be in the long run. I eat sushi almost 3-4 times a week at places such as ryu, park, etc... So I know what fresh fish tastes like. They will never see me there again!! And someone wrote a comment saying that this place makes u feel like youre not in montreal... I live in Toronto where they actually have good food and service... And trust me this place made me feel exactly like I was in montreal, because only in montreal are they oblivious to the good service required in a high end restaurant."

The waiters were very friendly, with smiles on their faces the whole time. We were thanked by three different waiters when we left!The lunch menu has nice options at an reasonable price and they come with a bowl of salad and a bowl of noodles to start. I took the Jatoba salad which was very good; the salmon sashimi in it was very tasty. My boyfriend had the beef teriyaki on rice and veggies; it was really good and cooked perfectly. I have to say that I preferred my boyfriend's dish, but it might've been because I was very hungry and wanted some meat. Anyway, we exchanged our plates with each other halfway through, so in the end, I was satisfied!The dessert menu looked really good and creative, but it was too pricey for a lunch so we skipped that part of the meal (anyway, I had already planned a dessert for the birthday boy!).I will definitely come back for supper to try different dishes and all the desserts!
