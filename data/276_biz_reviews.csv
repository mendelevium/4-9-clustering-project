During the COVID period, they have sections A and B for waiting before getting in line-what a great set up! Though my nose tingled from the savory smells of za'atar and freshly-baked manouche, I visited Trip de Bouffe a few weeks ago for the express purpose of ordering maamoul. Once I noticed the baklava, I couldn't resist ordering some, too. After I told the cashier I wanted different types of maamoul, she picked different styles of baklava for me. Definitely come here if you need last-minute meals/snacks!From what I saw, it's debit or cash only. Trip de Bouffe, I will make a trip back one day to try more bouffes!"
/user_details?userid=GoFZbOT324fJsgPF620k_g,Steven F.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I strongly would not recommend this place. First they never get my order correctly. Today I asked for a falafel and I got something completely difference. The owner starts telling me that my mask is not adequate yet it is perfectly fine and then he tells me never to come back and that my friends aren't welcome either. I told him I wanted to support local restaurants and then he tells me that he'd prefer I didn't. Regardless of the mask, these guys are arrogant pricks and they don't give a damn about their customers."
/user_details?userid=1NtBKCmdlPC48FsZtPiF6Q,F J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Went to this place looking for authentic lahambajin and zaatar. Imagine my disappointment when the pies came out of a plastic bag that was chilling in the display case. WHAT??!! The dough NEEDS to be rolled on the spot and if at least that's not possible at least top it and bake it in a brick oven. Sorry but sticking with Abohadi (on Lincoln st. - previously known as Al Bhagdadi). To all the reviews raving about this place - please come back after you've tried Al Bhagdadi.
/user_details?userid=Lo3LL_up1o2RrXhivcbz2Q,Di L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Called up the other day for some items and was completely shocked by their prices. I know the market prices of Lebanese food and bakery goods. I will never pay 32 dollars a dozen for large Zaatar. I wanted to try them out, however, I  already have two Lebanese bakery's that I go to, and they charge both 15 dollars a dozen for large Zaatar.I guess when your business is on Mt.Royal street, you have no choice but to charge more because of the rent.  Too bad, I  will not  purchase any food items at your place because your prices are way too expensive."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Our favourite spot in the area for a quick Lebanese fix! We usually order an assortment of their appetizers, some Zaatir Pita and their dips for the complete experience. And then some Baklava for dessert! If you order a certain number of appetizers, there's no tax on the total! It's a very cheap spot regardless! The taste and quality of the food are excellent!! Service is prompt, helpful and friendly!! Our total with enough food for 2 people, was $18! Can not recommend it enough!!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the place of choice for my partner, to get his fix when he's feeling homesick for Cyprus or Lebanon - that should tell you how authentically delicious Trip de Bouffe is for middle eastern fare. They have a MASSIVE selection of traditional dishes (eat-in or take-away) and each is as wholesomely good as the next. His only complaint? That they make their kefta with ground beef instead of lamb. I'm not complaining though! There are so many tantalizing options that you'll have to visit multiple times just to take it all in, and they are worth the return visits. This weekend, we'll be catering his birthday party with a wide selection of their $1/each snack-sized treats: all manner of pastry bites, sweet and savoury. Yum! The décor here is awesome, with funky handmade chandeliers constructed with colanders (?!) and an odd and amusing selection of old world embroideries and wild animal photos. There are some shelves stocked with choice pre-packaged food stuffs, too, if you feel like making your own inspired nomnoms at home. And, final word: friendly, great service every time! Maybe I get street cred because my manfriend knows the skinny on all the foods, or maybe they're just awesome!"
/user_details?userid=x8DD07PHJ1CHO8qic4QOgA,Ita S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As a middle eastern- I love the food here. Get home made Hummus, Kebbeh, stuffed vine leaves, and Labaneh cheese with Zaatar. Have some cold Malhabi for desert. It's fresh, healthy and tasty. A bit too expensive for what it is. It's great for a quick healthy meal on the way or getting some food home to share with friends. Tip: try a dish you are not familliar with, the friendly staff would love to help"
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You HAVE to try the regular chicken pizza with garlic sauce! I can't stop ordering it, it's just perfect. Don't add any vegetables for the full experience. The place is super cute and they have other amazing homemade dishes as well :)"
/user_details?userid=RJBbkzxxTCuGOyKfeYH2tw,Carlos J.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Awesome spot to get a quock Lebanese food fix. Highly recommended the yogurt meat balls on rice, as well as the variety of salads including Tabuleh. Very high quality foods and deserts."
/user_details?userid=0nP7RnaaThFgphKUXtaZTw,F. L.,"Rochester, NY",3 star rating,"I really wanted to like it, based on the reviews, the looks of the food, etc, but I was disappointed. I went for breakfast and got an assortment of savory pastries. The mini zaatar pitas just weren't a satisfying texture, a bit too squishy. The spinach fatayer, the reason I came, were fine, but the dough was just missing some essential part of the flavor. Oh well."
/user_details?userid=kYv7-05S0qyzkxtuCDzVzQ,Hana E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I dropped by here today. I've been coming to Trip de Bouffer for the past two years and every single time the service was amazing and the food has been consistently unreal. I'm a bit picky with mMiddle Eastern food since I grew up eating it from the best chef ever: my mom :). But the food here is pretty close to perfect. Recommended: I absolutely love their veggie kebbe, mouhamara, the veggie pizza, chicken rolls (soo good!), and my all time favourite stuffed veggie vine leaves!As for prices, super cheap. The food is so filling. Everything is approximately a $1 and you get a deal if you get 1/2 a dozen etc. nothing expensive, well worth the great quality of food. 10/10!!!!!!!!- @Hanaer"
/user_details?userid=yDBHKkWEld05vL4LiAazRg,Phoebe C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hungry and anywhere near avenue Mont-Royal? Drop by here for a quick bite or a full meal, you won't leave disappointed. They have so many options of manoushes, all on house-made chewy flatbread. You pick the base type, and can then choose if you want to get it ""all dressed"" for and extra dollar fifty. It's then (painfully slowly) heated and rolled up, to be eaten like a pita wrap. It's the best, freshest tasting wrap we've ever had. Paul always gets the all dressed spicy chicken and I've tried the kechk (tomato, yogurt, sesame), the veggie, and the za'atar-cheese, all good. I ordered kechk thinking it was going to be strong and interesting tasting, but honestly it was pretty subdued.If you super love them, you can buy packs of 6 (8?) in the fridge to bring home!They also have a fantastic salad bar, and excellent hot mealsDon't forget to grab a manoushe pin on the way out!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you don't mind hipster vibe, you should check this place out. They have lots of delicious Lebanese snacks that you can order to take away, it will definitely be few of the best snacks you can bring to a party."
/user_details?userid=Mg8P-Sw04XtNAPX6gAGx8Q,Christina C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Being middle eastern myself I have to say this is top notch Arabic food. It feels as if my own grandmother spent all day slaving in the kitchen whenever I eat here. The grape leaves are incredible, especially the vege ones and the kibbeh is scrumptious. I always get their spreads, the mhamara is my personal favourite. The staff, no matter who it is, is always so sweet and hard working. The decor is awesome with hints of Lebanese originals. I truly love this place, it is perfect and I will continue to come here again and again.@cchehade"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Can I get a real quick AMEN for places that offer delicious food at extremely cheap prices + cozy vibes just for added measure? Trip de Bouffe offers all of these things, and it was like I took a step into Food Paradise when I walked in. I assume that whenever I see mountains of food around the corner and stocked on all of the shelves plus a decent amount of people in an establishment that it must be pretty good, right? So I decided to sample 6 different offerings (and forgo paying tax!) by getting two of each of the grape leaves, kibbeh, cheese rolls, and za'atar manaeesh and one meat and one veggie sambousek. All of this plus a coke came to 11.50 CAD, and after a quick heating of everything that was intended to be served hot, I dug in immediately.The grape leaves had a perfect balance of acidity and refreshing coolness as well as the savory texture of the rice. The kibbeh were basically balls of meaty goodness (that just sounded really gross but I don't know any other way to describe it) that are accentuated with doses of spice and onion without being overkill. Moving on to the cheese rolls, they were basically ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness stuffed in a little wrapping, but they didn't taste too greasy which was a pleasant surprise. The za'atar manaeesh tasted quite good for what seemed like simple mini flatbreads, and the sambouseks were each their own little pockets of flaky heaven combined with various fillings. After finishing everything, I almost didn't want to leave and just wanted to order more food, but alas, I have daily budget constraints I must abide by...I will definitely be coming back to Trip de Bouffe to sample their more filling hot dishes, as I've heard good things about the catfish in particular! Otherwise, come here if you really want to experience a wide variety of Lebanese food, which is arguably one of, if not the best Middle Eastern cuisines in my opinion."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2 star rating,When I stood in the shop and chose from the prepared dishes and salads presented behind the glass counter I was full of hope. We went for a filo bake with spinach and rice and a large bowl with three different salads. I expected oriental spices and intensive herbs but unfortunately the flavors weren't great at all. It's possible that Trip de Bouffe is great at other dishes but I'll probably not come again to risk it.
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Loved the checkh el mehche. The eggplant was so soft and juicy, and still in a good shape. It goes really well with rice. The feuillete aux epinards was also really good, but lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion. I like how all the meal is balanced with mainly vegetables and small amount of meat (or not at all for some vege options). The food tastes like healthy home made food, not greasy at all.The small snacks were a bit disappointing. The falafel was too salty...it felt like I bite into a ball of of spices. The cheese sticks and the chicken sticks are the best. The small pizzas were alright. By the way, there is no tax if you buy in dozen and you can mix all the snacks! :)The staffs were friendly and the place seemed really cozy, almost like you walked in someone's home. There was even a video projected into the white wall, which was pretty cool."
/user_details?userid=IXI8W2JbPaEWttrLTRNjLQ,E S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5 star rating,"This is my favorite place in Montreal and it's super well priced/affordable. Also, as a pescatarian this place is the bees knees. I usually get the basa fish or the moudardara (lentil dish) + the holy guacamole."

As soon as I came in in was taking by a beautiful smell that reminded of home, I knew this  was going to be an epic food experience and it was.They don't play around here :) it's legit."
/user_details?userid=OWuiBaTT2syXbawVeEVe5Q,Chris D.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"Food, portions, service, all perfect. Fresh made in-house, welcoming atmosphere and an absolute steal. What more could you want? I tripped into this spot in summer 2016, hooked instantly. I'd make recommendations but everything I've had I've loved. Ok, try everything, there you go. And get a t-short while you're at it. Alone or with a friend, Trip de Bouffe on Mont-Royal is well worth the diversion."
/user_details?userid=oJ1NGlcm7EUhv_Mx4nTWyw,Ricky V.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing Lebanese food. We were a little intimidated because there are no menus. You just order what you like from the displays. But the staff are multilingual and ready to answer questions. We got two pitas stuffed with veggies, grape leaves, and a serving of hummus. It came to about $20 and blew our minds."
/user_details?userid=OOQ67wUOU-a0o9LiBzZ7Kw,Marie-Josée K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So happy to have discovered this place! Middle eastern food lovers rejoice, this is as good as it gets. So many manoush options, sandwiches, salads and desserts. You can eat on site or get takeout and the staff is super friendly. Everything looks so fresh and delicious. Lots of love for this little shop!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"L-O-V-E. I need an option with more than five stars, please!First of all, I was immediately struck by Richie's penetrating blue eyeballs. He has all the girls swooning, I am SURE.  Anyway, all lusting aside, this place was an awesome discovery. Located in the heart of the Plateau, TDB offers an awesome array of all things Lebanese, made fresh daily, with what appears to be a lot of love, by a dude called Pops (who is literally, Pops to one of the owners). They have a variety of pre-made items such as marinated turnip (squeal!), important goodies, nuts & spices, and of course, the main attraction: home cooked Lebanese food ranging from humus and chicken to falafel and Lebanese-style pizza (I forget what that's called). The food is delicious. Enough said. They do have a small section if you're in the mood to eat in, but I think it's more of a pick up and go kind of place. As well, if you're having a party and feel too lazy to cook - go see these guys and they'll hook you up. Noms."
/user_details?userid=a5iX0JQhnyFoAVipBh-Cag,Genevieve H.,"Sydney, Australia",5 star rating,"Sometimes you just feel like a hot home-cooked meal. But there is nothing in the fridge or you really can't be stuffed cooking. This would be the moment where you leg it down to Trip de Bouffe. They are serving up hot, ready-to-devour home-cooked meals, as well as salads, sweets, coffee, bread; anything you could ever want really. They also sell refrigerated dishes and salads so if you premeditate getting into the same snitch again you can always grab one of those on your way out to put in the freezer. I wish Trip was a bit closer to my apartment though, it's delicious and inexpensive which makes it a place I could easily wind up at every other day."
/user_details?userid=zX0v7edWnSAo-8hEly-_1w,Niem X.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Yum! It's a reasonably priced counter place with a few tables. The staff is super friendly and more than happy to walk you through the different options. Great place for a big meal, a small meal, a savoury or sweet snack, even a nibble. The kibbeh are my personal favourite ($1.25/each, with discount if you get half a dozen or a dozen). There are vegetarian and meat options. They'll heat food up for you if you're having it there."

I go to pay for my meal with my debit card, which it clearly states that they take debit cards. The man then says they don't except American debit cards. I made it clear I didn't have any any cash on me and would be willing to leave without the food. he refused to let me leave the restaurant. He then threatened me and made me walk half a mile to an ATM while my boyfriend waited in the restaurant. I felt very scared. I would definitely not recommend this establishment."

Stuffed vine leaves - in the top 5 ever tasted according to my partner.  All stuffed pastries sampled so far amazing! Ah nuts! I have made myself so hungry for these amazing goodies that I have to cut this review short to go out and get some more.So, briefly, pick up your goodies there for your picnic on the mountain or to nosh at home in the depth of winter to remind you of warm Mediterranean breezes.Also, the guys really know their stuff, ask them about their dishes - they're so knowledgeable and friendly it's an added treat. Off I go! (Did I bring enough bags to carry it all home?)"

Its a lebanese Bakery full of home made  lebanese/Arab inspired goodies like Tabouleh , baba ganoush, Sambusac , baklava and an assortment of mixed salads, rice and meat dishes.  You can also find a variety of nuts , spices , juice, breads, yogourt, syrup drinks ( i hope you guys know of mint syrup or your life is missing something fundamental ) and the thing that i find most exciting : Olive oil - that you can actually sample before buying - offered in regular glass bottles or big metal bottles with a small faucet!  + so many more things to discover. An exciting little store for any food lover!This place is perfect  to come and pick up a lunch if you work around the mount royal area or pick up some of your favourite lebanese goodies ( i picked up some fresh whole wheat flat bread and humous )...and also just to discover some new flavours!"

Staff is really nice. It's a spot that I visit on a regular basis, just about every week, and they always have a decent number of customers, which is a good sign, too!"

/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Once you've eaten the pitas from this place, you'll never want to eat another grocery store pita again. You know they are made without loads of preservatives, because they go stale after only a few days, but with pitas this good its rare they will long enough to get to that point (stick 'em in the freezer if you can't eat them all in a day or two). And a trip to Trip de bouffe means the opportunity to stock up on dips and salads, and that's never a bad thing. I'm in love."
