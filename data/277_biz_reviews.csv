/user_details?userid=L21Zf-UthKbch8C2SonOaA,Simone M.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This review is solely for drinks, as we sat at the bar here to meet some friends and didn't order food. They have an awesome selection of cocktails-- frozen, cesars, mojitos, redbull cocktails, you name it. Every drink is about $9, but you can double the amount of alcohol in each drink for $2.75, depending on the kind of night you want to have. We had the frozen pink lemonade which was delicious, as well as the blueberry and regular mojitos, with the regular being much yummier and less syrupy sweet. The music at this bar/restaurant is awesome, as well as the decor and young, trendy vibe. Great place to grab drinks. I regret we ate before we came here because the menu looked delicious. Next time!"
/user_details?userid=3J8OoQEBaFQx6Ooyu3UkgA,Joyce A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I go here whenever I like to hang out with friends for drinks. I like the ambiance and the cocktails. This place is always packed on weekends. they have a huge menu and was also cheap!
/user_details?userid=OOWr74yjYooXIxgOQD0vhg,Tatiana S.,"Frederick, MD",3 star rating,"This is a popular hipster spot with a neat concept on food pricing. I believe it started out as everything was $5CAD, but they have expanded their portion sizes and menu which now has items for up to $12CAD. Still relatively reasonable for the quality of food you get! Being a vegetarian who loves mac and cheese, I gravitated towards the hot dog vege, which came with a vegetarian hot dog and was topped with mac and cheese. I added the vegetarian chili and it was a perfect comfort food meal for a cool night! The mac and cheese was delicious, the hot dog was pretty good but the baguette bread it came with made it a bit difficult to eat. The chili was awesome; it includes tofu, veggies and comes in a sauce that is pretty tasty. I give this place 3 stars because we sat outside, and for whatever reason, the wait service was pretty slow. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and being cooler than we thought outside, we were uncomfortable for a longer period than we would've liked."
/user_details?userid=hIiretCA57Jzy1lxLOGSjQ,Yasmin Z.,"Newmarket, Canada",3 star rating,"This was a great cheap lunch choice as we had just landed in Montreal. The burger itself was good for the price, although the menu started at $6.95 and not $5 as advertised. Regardless, the eggplant patty was great with the tzatziki. Their patio was nice and the decor inside was creative and fun. Overall decent food, but would have rather spent a few extra bucks for a tastier meal."
/user_details?userid=F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,Robert S.,"Providence, RI",3 star rating,"I got the Surf and Turf burger with fries.I asked for medium rare, but the burger came well done.  I asked the waitress about it and she said, these are premade patties and they are thin, so it's hard to get a pink level on the inside.    The burger was overdone for my taste, but it had two nice pieces of fried shrimp on top of the patty.   Overall it was ok, nothing to write home about.The fries were shoestring type, thin and crispy.   A bit bland (I usually eat low salt, low fat), so I had to add salt and pepper to them.   Nice crunch tough.   Nice service, nice ambiance."
/user_details?userid=LiD311vn_95gf_IJYjrjuA,Dawei L.,"Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,"First of all, 5$ a plate??? What? Don't worry it is not a scam and you do get a nicely portioned plate for what you order. The food itself is not top notch but pretty good nonetheless. Order two plates for 10$ for more variety and it's definitely enough to fill you up. Unless you are really hungry and if you are then you are better off going to the sushi buffet a few steps away.A perfect place to bring your gf/bf on a casual date. Because you also get a pretty large variety of cocktails, beers, or soft drinks if you need to drive after but why would you drive to downtown in the first place? Please use public transport it's greener than the salade that you should have ordered.The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars is because their fries taste like mcdonald's which is right across cinko. Coincidence? I'll let you decide."

The service was excellent, our waitress helped us translate the menu to English. The food was to die for. The sweet potato and regular poutine did not disappoint!! The burger had flavorful shrimp with cocktail sauce on it which was surprisingly delicious. Everything was just fantastic. I highly recommend trying this place !!"
/user_details?userid=b6fhQzWilqS7u160rSgwWg,Benahir C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",3 star rating,Affordable food. Good drinks. Menu is not in English. Ordered a quesadilla and burger (wasn't asked how I wanted the burger.... came out well done... not pleased). However atmosphere was trendy.
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try the cinko for a while now, and my wallet too. It's such a cool concept.I went for diner before a show and really enjoyed the ambiance.There was a dj even if it was only 17h30. A cool decor with tags and design prints. Even vinyle on the tables as doily.5$ is in fact 5,55$ only when you order a drink, but still, it's hella cheap! Two person with 2 drinks and sparkling water we ended up with only a 30$ bill!I took the hot dog cinko with fries and mac n cheese. There was not alot of condiment but everything was tasty and extremely filling. My boyfriend took the classic burger and it's the perfect name. Just a classic good burger with crispy fries. I had a good time. Quick and easy. Great!"
/user_details?userid=Zcip7fIYv5LhEgDGG-XhUQ,Alex N.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Pros: cheap, yet high quality and tasty dishes. Most are $5 but with an option of making it $7 or $9. The sweet potato poutine, surf & turf were very delicious and I highly recommend them.The sangrias were also something I would recommend.Mediocre: The fish & chips/tacos and the hot dog were good but not extraordinaryCons: the sheer crowds, long lines; the busier the more prone to mistakes"
/user_details?userid=0nblLFuD3a6QfaEthoBwHQ,Rosie S.,"Renton, WA",3 star rating,"Our Uber driver said this place was the place to go. Should have known... he was twenty-something. This place was loud and full of young people. Nice atmosphere, nice music. Our waitress never checked on us and we had to wave her down to get the check. Food and service is a 3/5, atmosphere was a 5."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm a bit on the fence for this one. On one hand, Cinko has a menu of not just incredibly cheap, but also interesting food AND a fantastic atmosphere of trendy music and decor. On the other hand, well, the food quality could be better. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, maybe I shouldn't expect more for something worth 5$ - but I think they can make a huge difference by just using fresher ingredients and being a tad more generous in their portions.I went there last night with friends, and we each ordered one dish. I declined adding side dishes to my Fish and Chips tacos. The service was fast and pleasant, and soon they brought in nicely presented, colorful plates of food. Although my tacos had a good combination of fried fish and pico de gallo, they were also topped with 3-4 awkward fries (the ""Chips"" part), and lined with an almost non-existent layer of guacamole that was tasteless and brownish from oxidation. The tomatoes were a bit watery and too acidic, but given in great amount to fill in for the fish. The overall taste of good, but it left me neither hungry or full. So I payed my 5.75$ bill, added some tips and left. I guess I ordered wrong. I think the best way would be to get more than one dish, and to share everything with friends. I'll try that next time!"
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"While I was looking for my next culinary adventure on Yelp, I've noticed a picture of Cinko's Ferrero Rocher dessert. I didn't need anything else, they had me at Ferrero loool  It was everything I expected: Given the location, I was expecting a student friendly environment (I was probably the oldest around) and music a little bit higher than the average and this is exactly how it was.I went there with a friend and we were seated at the bar (I really do not mind that spot, actually it's my favourite), the staff was very friendly and the service was extremely quick. I ordered a pitcher of beer with the fish and chips tacos and of course the Ferrero Cinko. It was good, simple and efficient what more could you ask for? I will return for sure!"
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: It has a nice look inside, but it's pretty dark. It's a very pub-like restaurant.FOOD: Their surf and turf burger was very good. However, their fries were dry and cold and felt like they had been out for a while. Their raspberry mojito tasted like it had no alcohol in it, wasn't a fan. Their portions are also small, especially their mac and cheese. Honestly, you can get much better for the same price at the Warehouse. Would not recommend this place.PRICE: Although it says 5$, you have to purchase a drink to be eligible to get this menu. Their drinks aren't the cheapest either so I guess that's where they catch you. SERVICE: It was decent. They did what they were supposed to do, nothing more."
/user_details?userid=l0kHXGxx-MBh-_AcISiQcA,Maxime C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First off: 5,55$ a plate.This is a place to please your wallet!Of course you'll find tastier restaurants on St-Denis, but for 5 bucks, this is a pretty good place. Nice staff, nice interior, nice terrace.My friends got the grilled tofu ciabatta with hummus and guacamole, and the Cinko veggie hot-dog, both served with either (delicious) fries or salad.On the contrary, I tried a new item on the menu: the fried chicken tenders. I found myself with 5-6 tiny and sad fried chicken tenders, no side dish. The blue cheese sauce couldn't save the plate. I ended up finishing my friends' fries.I guess (hope) this item won't stay on the menu for long.I'll keep this address on my mind when I'm in the neighbourhood nevertheless!"
/user_details?userid=UcDbM8BYqAaBTZHafnNX_w,Yulia O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"5,55$ for every dish if you buy a drink.For that price point quality is very good, staff is friendly, place as a whole is very nice. But service is not very fast. There is often queue in the evenings and you should wait approximately 15-20 minutes to begin your gossip session. Very tasty sweet potatoes fries and cider!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I knew about this restaurant before but never thought about trying it out, the 5$ price is appealing but I was always a bit sceptical of the portions. Decided to take the plunge on a Friday afternoon after biking all day. Me and my boyfriend were ravenous and everything on the menu looked good. We both got the burger but I opted for a side of mac and cheese and fries, he got the salad and the 7$ option of the burger (which comes with a pickle). The food was delicious, a really good burger and an even better mac and cheese. I wish the portion was bigger and that you could order it as a meal instead of a side. (You need to order a meal to be able to order a side of something). The restaurant is nice and busy. It has its unique quality to it. The place mats are old vinyl's. But there were some low points: I didn't like the music they were playing and the service was horribly slow. I mean we waited 30 minutes before our order was taken and the waitress forgot our order so she had to come back which meant our food hadn't even started to be prepared. But the girl was new and I understand the difficulties of any new job so I didn't hold that against her or the rating of the overall restaurant experience. The portions are adequate. Since I added the macaroni, it was honestly a bit too much. I'm a light eater, I eat little portions but a lot of them. But some people need to eat a lot and not as often, so I would recommend ordering more food if you are one of those people. Since everything is cheap, it's not really a stretch to order more. The burger didn't fill up my boyfriend at all.I would go back, it was good food, good price, overall great experience."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Have been here several times. I noticed they change their menu. To have a 5$ meal, you need to purchase a beverage. The beer is a great choice. My husband and I both like the surf and turf burger the most, with fries. This time I found the salad is not very fresh."
/user_details?userid=vpldxbdbHIWdtm3CU49bsA,Joe A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The staff is very friendly and polite. The whole place has a very hip vibe and is very clean especially considering how busy it is!I had a veggie dog with the optional chili. The meal itself was quite filling. The flavor of the chili was unfortunately bland and didn't compliment the toppings of the veggie dog at all and was served overt top the hot dog. The pint I had was more expensive than similiar establishments and, combined with the underwhelming meal, made me realize I was taking my first and last trip to this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Sat at the bar thinking it would be quick and simple service. Bartender was checked-out service wise. No effort to produce a passable service or even speak to me in the language of my choice. PAS FORT PHIL.I ordered the grilled cheese, which I had had here before. I was surprised when the bartender asked if I would like fries or salad as I didn't recall the grilled cheese coming with a side last time. When the waitress came with a plate, she offered to set a hamburger down in front of me. I said ""no"" and communicated that that wasn't my order. The waitress looked at the bartender and confirmed that the burger was for 102, the bartender looked at me and said I was 102 and that this was my meal. I reiterated my ""no"" at which point the meal was placed in front of me and both staff members walked away. So let me get this right, TWO staff members can be told that this isn't what I ordered, both will ignore me and not bother to even ask what I had actually ordered to correct the situation? You're literally going to ignore me? At that point I just wanted my bill and to GFTO. (Also, HOW did you get ""hamburger"" from ""grilled cheese""? They're even the same words used in both languages!!)I poked at some fries seeing as it was pointless to try and get this fixed with their staff who clearly didn't care. I asked the busboy for the dish to be wrapped up to go as I was in no mood for a burger. Ended up having a bite of it at home. Ketchup covered salad greens and a flavorless overcooked burger patty. Yum...? $5 menu... you get what you pay for, and the service is s***."

/user_details?userid=4obu3tumBVjlMD8oE-oSIg,Olivia S.,"Hatchville, Hatchville, MA",3 star rating,"Great interior, nice service. I was excited to try this place out and was let down, the food was all microwaved and could have been SO much better with just a little more effort and ingredients. The concept for 5$ plates is such a good idea, so instead of trying to do larger plates that are poorly executed they should have done less but higher quality. Keep the menu at 5$ and don't move all the way up to 12$...."
/user_details?userid=p4kJqoVlUL75N8dm-gDb2Q,Christopher V.,"Keene, NH",5 star rating,"It's been 4 years since my last review of Cinko and first off, the food is still interesting and DELICIOUS. SECONDLY, the prices are still fantastic. In 2014 each item was $5 and now in 2018 each item is $5.55. Name me any other restaurant in Montreal that has kept their prices this low in four years. I always try something different when I come here and this time I had the Grilled Cheese with Duck and Red Onions and the Surf and Turf Burger... Both were excellent. I ALWAYS finish off with the Tempura String Bean Poutine which I love, love, love. Add in a couple of beers and I am one happy camper. I am NEVER disappointed at Cinko."
/user_details?userid=fbQiykh15AqNWl5H6I8-Kg,David C.,"Manchester, CT",4 star rating,"Really great spot on the main drag in Montreal. Cool vibe, young friendly staff. We had the blueberry mojitos (recommend), mac-n-cheese, chili, cheeseburger, and salad. All excellent and perfectly sized portions. Our waiter was wonderful as well. Worth a visit if you are visiting the city."
/user_details?userid=DCcweTztEpGjZrtHhCWMcQ,John L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Sweet potatoe fries with bacon was good.  Fries and bacon were crispy and was good combination of sweet and salty.  I also got the burger and it was disappointing.  It was very dry and had to drink 3 glasses of water.  Prices for all items were very affordable most at $5 per item. The loud music made it hard to chat with other friends.  Probably won't visit this place again unless I am interested in some cheap late night eats.
/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to this place with my friends for the first time.  Very good environment with TV's and music. Styled place for a late night restaurant. Their foods are very tasty, specially the salad. I ordered salad & Poulet Portugaise. The portion is too small (but only 5$ each plat). You have to order 2~3 orders with a drink for a personal if you are really hungry. So the bill can easily go up over 20$ if you add some extra stuffs. I have to say the real price is $$I suggest this place for after bar since they open until 4 AM if you are looking for snacks.Also they don't have takeout. Better order one at time to make sure no waste."
/user_details?userid=KOJC_HudfqJB62Jy2QebJQ,Sarah S.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Good service, got seated very quickly. Catered  to our non french speaking skills which was good. Food came quickly, wish it was more flavored with salt and pepper but we were able to add our own seasoning to our dishes which were good. I got the cinko hot dog which was very good, also got the poutine which was very good and filling for the entire table. Also my sister got the risotto with mushroom and grilled chicken and the Portuguese chicken with veggies and fries was also ordered. Everything was over all good. I like the idea everyone has to but drinks and then all your meals are only $5.55!! Thats pretty awesome!! Great music as well which was such a plus. This was our first spot after arriving to montreal and it was a good choice!"
/user_details?userid=CdeyZZ6ZGhvs7YCzVheeRg,Emma W.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"Just fantastic. How can food be this good for so cheap?! Great service too. We had the CINKO hot dog (it has Mac n cheese my lord), surf n turf burger, and the deep fried ferrero rochers. Great place for travellers who don't want to break the bank."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cinko is a groovy little spot on Saint Denis where, to me, it gives off an effortlessly cool air. The overall ambience of dim lights, the loud blast of quality music covering a span of genres and time periods through the speakers, and accentuation by the means of old vinyl records as place mats and pictures of legendary musicians make this place ideal for young Montrealers. In addition, the food is actually and obviously cheap and affordable enough for broke university students to enjoy, so Montréal Blog might want to take note when advising that age group on where they should go to eat instead of listing what Yelp would put in the $$-$$$ range.The food, while nothing particularly mind-boggling (except for a very delicious bread pudding), gives customers an incredible bang for their buck, especially the burger meals. I got the classic burger with fries, and it was nicely-sized and filled me up in a satisfying way. It went along quite well with the mojito (the $5 rule doesn't apply to alcoholic drinks by the way), which, although on the weaker side, was still delicious and presented in a cute jar.Finally, to top off the experience, I decided to try the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, and I was not disappointed. It has the perfect balance of piping hot and ice cold creamy goodness that all come together for a heavenly experience in your mouth, with just a bit of added crunch from the walnuts to top it all off. If you have extra room in your stomach for dessert, then I highly recommend you try this dish.Overall, a rad place with good vibes and good food that just might make you feel cooler than you actually are. Stay classy Cinko."
/user_details?userid=hNz5GQmyycds-xX8zHJGFw,Jonathan C.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,Great food. Waitress was really nice and the fish tacos were absolutely amazing. Water was served complimentary and food was relatively cheap. ($25 for two) Great place to eat for lunch with a buddy or alone.
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,The first time I went to Cinko it was closer to when it had just opened and I had a great experience. We sat outside and we shared a few dishes such as the sweet potato poutine and the tempura poutine which were all very good especially for $5 a dish!! This time we sat inside and the AC was blasting so we were freezing. The service was very slow. We got our bloody Cesaers only after we finished our meal! I had the fish tacos with fries. I was disappointed that the fries were inside the taco rather than as a side. The taco was a bit dry and I had mayo to it which made it better. For five dollars the food is worth it and the portions are good  but they need to improve  service.
/user_details?userid=q7S0YHoPVvVYNnBLt0otAg,Jackson H.,"Muncie, IN",4 star rating,"Cinko is a cool place. It has a nice ambiance. The music was definitely a bit loud, but it's a bar/restaurant. The menu had a good selection of drinks and food. I personally had a margarita and surf and turf burger. The burger was really good. I never thought about putting shrimp on a burger, but it works! Margarita was standard. I appreciated the lower prices. This obviously translates to smaller portions, but that's perfect if you just want a light meal and more alcohol :) I'd go again."
/user_details?userid=LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,Francis T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A small restaurant where all the courses are only $5!!!The good: Nice decor and ambiance. Food is good. The burger is very juicy, not dry, filling, and the most popular choice of this restaurant. A lot of vegetarian plates available. Bathroom design is pretty awesome.The bad: At that price, portions are small (but burger is fine). Everything extra, costs extra, and that is where the price stacks up. You can wait a long time before getting a seat, so be patient. Terrific food, but small portions, so you might not be satisfied after your meal."
/user_details?userid=yQnQ3URA4bgwz-sCADtDgQ,Jaye S.,"Richmond, Canada",3 star rating,"Prices are cheap, when we went it was not crazy busy yet the service was still really slow and no one came around to fill up water.Had Portuguese chicken (see pic) it was pretty much a bite size piece, which I must say was seasoned nicely and had good flavour.Yam poutine was good.Shared bread pudding after seeing great reviews but was not impressed it was a doughy cinnamon bun like creation with walnuts. We just had a spoonful each and decided to pass on it since it was not that tasty.Ok place to go for a cheap meal but nothing great."
/user_details?userid=_iXst4txxHr1Q1pJMLV_CA,Courtney W.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"In this area you will find tons of restaurants. In passing this restaurant has always seemed to have a big crowd with blasting music so I decided to stop by. It was around 6pm and there was a wait of about 4-5 people in front of me. Before she took my name I asked if there was seating at the bar, which there was so I proceeded inside. The restaurant was a nice size with a stairway towards the back area leading to more seats. The bartenders seemed to be very busy but were cheerful and seemed to work well together. To drink I ordered a drink called Kho Phi Phi. It was rum-based with several liqueurs and some juices. The drink was made so quickly I didn't get a chance to see but it looked yummy. My first sip I felt a sugar rush through my back teeth, very tart and tangy but pretty good (if you like fruity drinks). The color definitely reminds you of an ocean. I looked at the menu and didn't see anything I really had a taste for but majority of the items are $5 or a little above. They consisted of basic things like nachos, burgers, quesadillas, etc. I ordered an appetizer mexican tortilla soup. Unlike my drink,  it took about 20-25 minutes before it came out. It was served hot with triangle-shaped bread. The soup and bread were both surprisingly good. Service was pretty good and I noted no major concerns. If you're in the area and need a quick bite, check them out."

The service is okay, nothing to complain about or to compliment. The food is probably the best thing about this place, I really liked my tacos and the burger was good. The price is another great thing about this place, if you're on a budget and not a big drinker, then you should like their $5 dollar menu. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I probably won't go there on Friday night again due to the long waiting lines."

The menu had a lot to choose from you needed to order alcohol to make your meal be $5 which is not bad I had a raspberry fizz the alcohol tasted like water to me. It's better suited for groups it's very loud here. The inside decorate was nice. The servers here were fast and good although very busy they managed well I had the veggie burger with sweet fries poutine, the poutine was delicious but the portion was so small like baby sized.

The vibe is modern and the food creative and tasty.  The sweet potato Poutine is good, so was the Portuguese chicken and deep fried Ferrero Rochers. It's got a terrasse alongside the resto in the summer. However, in the colder months it's limited to indoors and there are lineups for the supper rush because the menu deal that gets people in from 2-5:30pm are the incredibly cheap drinks.  So getting there early might still mean lining up.  The staff are great and they had their own DJ on his MacBook mixing some beats at the bar. At $5, you can afford to try a lot of things and they let you split items on the menu so go ahead and get a taste of everything!"
/user_details?userid=fExj_WQCSQnqtJJitlp1ag,Lauren S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Honestly the only reason to go here is for the beer. Less than 5$ for a pretty decent glass of a few varieries of beer is a better price than youll find most places around here. The food is all 5.55$ which is about what its worth to be honest. I had a surf n turf burger, the beef patty was pretty much overcooked and on the verge of being burnt, but the shrimp on top where cooked perfectly and were tasty. Fries were meh. Would recommend for beer but thats it."

The skeptic (and food snob) in me was super hesitant, but I've finally caved. They don't take reservations, but when you get there, you'll see that there's always a line up.Good: The portions were very decent considering it was only $5. We've ordered the beet salad, fish tacos and naan bread pizza to share. I don't drink and my boyfriend took his car too, so we ended up ordering a bottle of water and tea (note: They have DavidsTea). The bill total came to $20.25 before tax for 2 people...very inexpensive. The food wasn't oustanding by any means, but I was surprised at how good it was for $5 a plate. Bad: It's a lot younger and rowdier crowd, which is different than the spots I've frequently visit. The entry door also has 18+ stickers all over, which resmembles a sketchy sex shop. It left a weird impression at first, but I left with a pleasant experience.Bottom line: It's $5 food, it's not going to be amazing, but at least it's pretty good! Definitely worth the money."

Everything started good , the waiter was cute and nice at first. He barely spoke English. No problem I have google translate. So after trying to figure out the menu ( because everything is in French) I decided to share food with my mom. She ordered chicken tacos with guac and salsa. My brother got the poutine and a burger. I also ordered a side of bacon that I never got sadly. We also got virgin lemonades that guess this cost us $12.00 EACH with a rotten slice of lemon in glass a regular plain frozen lemonade 12 freaking dollars ! Absolutely not worth it at all. But whatever , we waited about 35 mins for our food. It came to us COLD and FLAVORLESS like WTF . We wait all that time and the food isn't even hot. I was so disappointed. Than we had to move inside because it started to pour down raining. So now that makes the food soggy, flavorless, and even more cold. Will not return to Cinko. And trust me there is nothing cajun or american about this place.I will say they have the best bathroom in any establishment I've been in all year. The inside is very very nice and instagram worthy. Too bad the food can't match that."

With the atmosphere of the place, i was not disappointed. Not sure what the theme is but its funky, hip, and cool! With the menu, it is true that their dishes are offered for 5$, however usually portion isnt that big. Well, its adequate for 5$! You can choose add ons and that will augment the price. They also have all you can drink fountain drinks for 3$ i believe. The drinks are NOT 5$ however. I didn't order any drinks so i cannot comment on that. I ordered the tacos (pretty good, has rice in it, unusual but pleasant flavour), the sweet potato poutine (SO GOOD, hope the size could be a bit bigger tho), and salmon salad (this was the miss of today's order. Although salad was fresh and dressing was ok, salmon was way way way too salty. So unless you reaaaally like eating salty, i would not recommend it.) Service was quick and pretty good. Overall, pleasant experience, i want to try l'entrepot next time to see which place i prefer, but I prob will come back to try their burgers next time!"

So i yelped a cheap spot and Cinko came up! Why not try it? Okay so there was a line up, and it was raining, not fun to be waiting in line for what seemed an eternity , but it was only 15mns. I guess on a Saturday afternoon that's not long at all! The place it self is quite small, but I didn't expect much for a 5$ din din. We sat in the back very close to a nice couple. mind you the place is very small.  The menu had different things which is really good for indecisive people like me! I thought everything was 5$ but the more you add things  the price will either go up to a 1$-4$. Cool thing is that they had free refills on fountain drinks! That's a total plus in my books. I ordered a Burger Surf and Turf (beef patty and I believe 2 Panko fried shrimps) 5$  with a side salad instead of fries , my boyfriend had Burger classique with a poutine instead of fries which came to 7.50$ , his fountain drink was 3$. It took forever to get our food, but since im a chatterbox I was able to use my talent to kill time! The waitress was nice, and gave us our refills fast enough. The food tasted good nothing to go crazy about but it was good and the atmosphere was chill. The place mats are old vinyls I dig it!Since I never order desert I decided to go for the fried hazelnut chocolate donuts. I don't recall the exact name. Ohhhhh it tasted like heaven! There was a mint mousse which  I wasn't too fond of it.  Total was about 25$ Yes this place is a must go if you are on a budget and just wanna go to a decent place with an inviting atmosphere! I suggest ordering 2 things if you have a big appetite as the portions are small.I will definitely  go back!"
/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"I dropped by Cinko last night with my husband and a friend of ours. The restaurant was jampacked and on the noisy side, with music playing so loud it was difficult to hold a meaningful conversation; definitely more a bar atmosphere than a restaurant.The food at Cinko is cheap; as the name hints it, all the food items on the menu are $5 each. Furthermore, it's possible add extras (cheese or jalapeño for example) to your plate for $1 to $2 more a piece. May it be noted that there are several vegetarian options on the menu, so that's definitely a plus for veg people out there.The food itself was very decent; not the most amazing food I've ever tasted but certainly good, especially for the price. On the noteworthy side, Cinko uses vintage records place mats, quite a unique use of these artifacts! The decor was original too; lots of black and white seemingly hand-drawn patterns and art on the walls, a design which can also be found on the bathroom sinks and even on the toilets themselves!The main part of the Cinko experience I find regrettable is the loud music and the lack of space. Perhaps the formula of cramming as many people as possible in a locale and cranking up the volume works well in some bars to get the alcohol flowing, but it's not so nice when you are hoping to eat a meal and catch your breath.I don't know if I will ever be back. I wish good fortune to the owners nonetheless. They have an interesting business in their hands and good waiters."

They were playing cool music the whole time. Only downside was the service - they seemed to take advantage of tourists, tricking us into ordering the most expensive drinks after telling us of a $5 cocktail deal....The drink was good but not the $5 cocktail I was expecting.

I would contend that the portions are actually quite generous for the price, and the items we ordered (the green bean tempura poutine and the gravlax salad) did not fall short on taste. The alcohol menu is not priced the same way, but I can attest to that everything is still pretty cheap.I would recommend this place as a start-off to a night out, especially between the outdoor seating and the large group booths."

It was pretty good, and beautifully presented, but the bottom of my chicken was kind of charred ):I also had the bread pudding which was pretty tasty. I've never had bread pudding before, so I can't compare but I thought the bread pudding was a bit hard. Still, the sauce was good. Will probably come back to check out their other selections!"

Our server was a little bit slow to come take our order or check on us for more water BUT that being said for 5$ the food was decent. I had the fish tacos and a cocktail.

Food wise, it is nothing special but for $5, I'm not complaining. The bun on the mac and cheese hot dog came soggy, their sausage lacked flavour and the mac and cheese tasted very ordinary. However, we had a great experience with their bread pudding: its super rich and goey packed with caramel, a must get!"

We went on Friday night (maybe our fault) and there was a DJ playing music at club volume. Made it a bit tough to hear the person across the table without shouting. If you are on a budget or not too hungry this is a cool spot because you can get most dishes for just $5 (or $7 or $9 if you opt for the upcharge options)."

We were seated at a long table that had another couple at the other end, and all had plenty of room for outdoor dining. It drizzled a bit at one point but the umbrellas were enough to keep the rain out. The poutine was the only one I had while in Montreal, and I thought it was very good!"

The restaurant goes a lot deeper than it looks, and I was impressed how they set up the place. It was a little crowded, but they managed to make it work. All the dishes are $5 but you have the choice of adding extras. I got the fried chickpea salad with a side of naan bread ($1.50 extra). Just be aware that the portions are really small. So if you're really hungry, it's probably not the best place to go. The salad was great, but the size of it was not worth $5. The naan bread was slightly burnt. The drinks were better. I got the Sweet Ginger and the Republic. The Sweet Ginger was amazing, but not strong. I ended up spending around $30 including tips so the $ is deceiving."

The first time, it was Monday evening, at like 9:45. The place was packed but we were seated real fast. We had a braised beef poutine, a classic burger, and a red curry soup.The braised beef poutine was tasty, but it didn't contain much beef. I was told today that we could add more beef for 2$ extra.The classic burger contained good flavors. I could clearly taste the garlicky sauce, the homemade ketchup, the bacon, the american cheese. But the patty. It was burnt and dry as hell. It literally had a thick crust of cremated beef on the outside and dried out mince on the inside....like really really 'well done', except 'well done' beef = no good beef. Now, for all you food police out there, don't hate: beef is supposed to be eaten medium rare. You only eat your steak well done when the meat is not fresh.Anyway, the red curry was very average. Nothing particular, you can probably invest that 5$ elsewhere... like on a cinko hot dog hahahaa.... So I just had the cinko hotdog today and well... it was good for the price. It's basically an average tasting hot italian sausage on ciabatta bread, with a scoop of mac n cheese spread all over the plate. Oh, and there was raw beetroot on the bread. Eating it was a mess so if you're there on a date, AVOID AT ALL COST!! Otherwise, pig out like no one's watching (everyone's prolly too damn drunk to notice anyway). I also happened to have tried the braised beef pappardelle. In one word: salty. Granted the portion was relatively small, but the density of salt in that little pot of pasta was too damn high. I wouldn't take it again.Hope this review helped you indecisive eaters choose :P"

To start, my friend and I never got water, until the last 15 minutes that we were there. We both got vegetarian burgers. I specified more than once that i wanted the same thing as my friend. When mine came, after 2 bites I realized I was given a cheeseburger with bacon...... I dont eat pork, beef or cheese. It took a while to get the waiters attention and I was barely offered an apology for the mistake. He stumbled up to me standing like 10 away, saying sorry without looking me in the eyes. Pretty whack apology. He never came to check on us, or bring us water, but he was checking all the tables around us. Another waiter ended up taking over for him once I mentioned the mistake, shout out to David for being great and bringing me what I originally asked for. Also, thank you to David for bringing us water 40 minutes after we sat down because the first waiter never came back to check on how we were doing. I understand that mistakes happen but thats a pretty bad one.... I was asked if im vegan regardless of if i am or not, it doesnt change anything. The original waiter decided to tell me he pressed the cheeseburger with bacon button because its directly next to the button for the vegetarian burger. An excuse didn't really interest me, or bring back all the time that was wasted waiting for it to be corrected. Disappointing experience. Also, skip getting the mini chicken fingers because it comes with 4 tiny pieces for 6$, not really worth it. The pink lemonade was good, except you can tell there wasnt much alcohol in it.

I went on a warm summer evening and managed to get seated quickly although the restaurant was full when I arrived. The decor was fancier than what I expected and had a slightly edgy and creative vibe. It would be ideal for a younger crowd.I had two of the most popular items on the menu: the watermelon salad  and the chicken with the sweet potato poutine. The salad had too much seasoning but the chicken and poutine were well cooked.

/user_details?userid=_OkEXLN_5T9cMc3UFrLT9A,Lily A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cinko is a great restaurant for a very cheap meal. Everything on the menu is literally $5.00 for a $12 portion. I've been there a few times and have had the braised beef sweet potato poutine (my favourite). The beef was always tender, and the sweet potato fries perfect with the well seasoned gravy. I've also had the soup (I believe it was a cheese soup - I don't see it on the website anymore) but it was also tasty. The service is always great, music good, and the decor is fun with its 60's Warhol feel.This is definitely a go to for a meal on a budget - that being said, I will add that the drink menu is on the pricey end - but for a $5 dish, I'll excuse this."

The silver wear was not clean.  Menu was more than just Mexican.  Service was slow. Pricing was very reasonable. Food does take longer than expected for this type of food.  Portions a bit small. Food was ok.  I wouldn't go back but i wouldn't avoid it either.
/user_details?userid=FTb3Gl_IYrHHDPGYVThmgg,Max G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went there for lunch on a Saturday with my partner.- Considering its location, the food was very inexpensive, which was a very pleasant surprise.- The food was very good, especially for its price. We had a burger and a quesadilla, both of which were great (in size and quality). - The fries we both got on the side of our meals were extraordinary!- It was not busy, or overbooked. The atmosphere was very nice, and the waiters were very friendly.- The waitress we had was very English friendly, and even offered to replace my menu with an English one (unnecessary but very polite of her to suggest).Overall, I would absolutely recommend this again to anyone visiting or living within walking distance of the restaurant. A perfect place for a casual, lazy weekend lunch. We will absolutely be returning again, probably many times over!"

We tried these 4 items : Gravlax salad, Ceasar salar, Fish Taco, Shrimp and Beef burger.The salads were great, full of flavour and ingredients. The taco was good, and the burger disapointing, a frozen McDonalds like dry patty with 2 shrimps. I don't mind the burger being a bit smaller perhaps and getting a nice fresh -notfrozen patty of meat. Oh well, would come back for a salad! (Or perhaps desert?)"

I was very reluctant to go at first, paying 5$ for anything in the menu seems awfully too good of a deal. First think you would wonder is how is the quality of that food or wha are they going to feed me? I decided to go and find out for myself. The first time I went I ordered the vegetarian burger, I was pleasantly surprise. The burger was delicious and it came with a side of fries. I would recommend you to try it. Second time, I went with a friend, there was a little wait before we got seated. I am surprised there is not a line around the block especially during dinner time. We ordered a pitcher of beer, alcohol is a bit pricy than your regular restaurant but you have to give it to them. It is a business and they gonna have to make some money after all. We ordered the surf and turf and naan appetizer. The naan was good, it came with two sauces, Spanish lemon sauce and a sour tomato sauce. The Spanish was pretty good, tomato was too bland for my taste. The surf and turf burger came with fries. It was pretty good. The ambiance is nice, the DJ was playing late 90s early 2000s music. I bounced on my chair while having dinner, couldn't help it."

We got seated and our drink order taken and delivered pretty quickly and were told by our waitress that she'd be back for the food order. We waited 30 minutes while sipping on our watery Caesar's before getting too antsy. After 45 minutes and still no one stopping by our table, we tired to flag down a waitress. Got one a few minutes later who told us quickly and with very little concern that our waitress would be right with us. It was an hour and twenty minutes by the time she showed up, our drinks had been done for about 45 minutes at that point with no attempt to refill those either, so we decided to just get the bill and go. I understand a restaurant being busy but it wasn't currently busy and this was a little extreme, especially when we paid $12 for mediocre drinks and didn't end up eating at all. The Warehouse does a cheap menu much better so I would highly recommend heading there if you want to have a cheap meal and great service!"

/user_details?userid=4Eaenf_bC7_T95j7wO2r8g,Chi L.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Found this place by accident and it turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our recent trip to Montreal. We weren't exactly hungry and so a place that sold food for $5 sounded about perfect. We were seated quickly, and luckly, we had been there before the lunch rush from the college crowd nearby.The menu was a bunch of cards held together by a ring, like the side/beverage/dessert menus you'd see at the end of the table for some restaurants. The plate coasters were record disks. Our party of three ordered a mint, cucumber, ginger-ale mojito; a Mount-Royal sangria with blueberries. I am sure I have the names wrong. Just go by the descriptions. For food, we ordered the hot dog with mac-n-cheese -because, obviously, mac-n-cheese- the grilled salmon, and the farfalle pasta salad.The drinks were mediocre, to be honest. They were good, but sweet and lacking in alcohol. No, they costed more than $5. The Cinko name didn't apply to drinks, at least not ours.The farfalle salad was, depending on your taste, either about perfectly dressed, or too sour. The mac-n-cheese was not as cheesy as I expected -but for 5 dollars, what do you want? At least it didn't look like a blob of culinary concrete chunks. The hot dog that the the macaroni sat over was excellent. The sausage was good. Earthy, meaty, but not as spiced as one might expect. The bread, the same kind of baguette that was cold and hard the night before, was warm, chewy, and homogenous, hiding a layer of mayo-dressed purple cabbage. So harmonial. The crust was not the hard shell that ruined it for me the night before. It made me understand why the French would bake this bread. The side that came with was poutine. I probably should've gone with the salad. The other choice is plain, old, regular, boring, fries. Comm'on, I'm in Montreal! If I had the choice, I'm going to have poutine! Well, it was a little saltier than the poutine I had the night before. Yes, I had two dinners. Vacation efficiency = food/time.The salmon was by far the best dish. It tasted fresh, flaky, and like salmon. The pesto rice was reportedly good. The side, which is vegetables if I remember right, is how vegetables should be served. No one wants plain steamed vegetables. No one. That is boring, tasteless, and wasteful, because no one enjoys it, and the wonderful flavors have not been released. Julienne it, dressed with some herbs, some vinegar, and I wish I had ordered the salmon instead.Service was responsive. Our waiter was attentive to the fact that we didn't speak French or understand the dual-tax on the receipt. And winked a lot."

Take heart ,and if you are worried about your heart, fear not, there are veggie and some lighter fare options. I had the veggies wrap, which was very good, lots of FRESH crisp veggies wrapped inside a green tortilla, with a chocolate mousse with raspberry coulis for dessert... yummy indeed! My friend had the curried chicken dish ,followed by the same dessert as I had, and she proclaimed that it was better than what she'd had at Juliette & Chocolate,and for a far better price, oh my!

All the menu items are 5$, a great bargain. The portions are surprisingly big for the price, and one entree + one main should fill up a medium appetite, unlike tapas places in which you are expected to have multiple small dishes to yourself. They have a seasonally changing menu. The items I've sampled are the watermelon salad (fresh and light, could use more watermelon), the sweet potato fries (standard), the Portuguese chicken (good), and their poutine.The dishes are simple, but the value at this price-point is nearly unbeatable. There is indoor seating and a nice table for a larger group of people, and in the summer there is seating on the side of the restaurant, close to the library.5$ includes even the tax!"

So I said; ""Ok... Well can we get water then, we've been here for 30min and we haven't got nothing to drink yet?"" (it's was 32 degrees outside). She said, packed with attitude; ""I'll go tell him but as I said he's busy with other clients right now, I'm not the server."" She clearly could've bring us water or at least apologize, the restaurant was near empty and she wasn't even busy herself. Note: she was also eating chips at the entrance waiting for new clients. Wow, after 40 mins the server comes. Service was 0/10 at this point. When I was done and the server took my plate back, he literally took my utensils and threw them in my plate! Literally threw them. I looked at my 2 friends and we just couldn't realize what happened, it wasn't a fast throw, it was a piss-off-kind-of-throw.
