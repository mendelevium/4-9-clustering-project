Got some beers and drank on the outdoor patio (tried the soft pretzel which was delicious). Not long into our time there, it started to downpour. Another group and ourselves decided to wait out the rain under the patio umbrellas where the waitress was still attentive and waiting on us. After the rain stopped, the staff was quick to come out and wipe all the tabletops and seats on the patio dry. Looking forward to coming back during our next trip to Montréal!"

Owner, Martine was extremely gracious. Sampled an excellent Crianza with enough to share. Food was superb. Small, tasty, well paired offerings make this an excellent place to stop, get warm & rest your bones. Good conversation made it even better.  Plan on stopping in again. Cheers!!!"
