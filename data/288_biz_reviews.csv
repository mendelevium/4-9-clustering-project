/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Authentic Mexican that hits all the right spots!! My favourite item from the menu are the Tacos!! The salsa, cilantro, onion and lime in the Taco works perfectly with the tender meat in every single bite! The sauces are really spicy, tasty and fresher then the bottled ones you find in a supermarket. The server was very helpful and friendly!! Will definitely recommend this spot!!"
/user_details?userid=LiD311vn_95gf_IJYjrjuA,Dawei L.,"Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,"I've never been much fan of tacos but this place made me love tacos! I tried their pasteur and loved it. The meats in it are super tender and well marinated. Combined with their choices of spicey sauce and it simply makes it more tasty. I'd recommand using the least spicy sauce because althought the most spicy sauce is great but it kind of overshadows the taste of tacos. Out of curiousity, I tried the Chaparritas drink, and really loved the soft taste of it. Definitely would recommand this. The only inconvinience is that they only take cash. They do have an ATM but the fees :'(100% coming back... with wacks of cash in hand to try all their tacos"
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Now this is what I call LEGIT MEXICAN TACOS abroad. A Mexican here on duty.Not everywhere in the world you can have some bomb tacos that make you feel closer to Mexico.What are the three things you need for a taco to be perfect? - Good tortillas (check), good salsas (check), good meat (Super check!)For those who are craving for Pastor, Lengua (beef tongue) and Suadero you most certainly will satisfy those needs here. Sauces are for all categories, for those who seek just some nice flavor; and those who relish numbing their tongue with hot-sober-you-up salsa. The seasoning is exact, the service is fast enough, and staff is polite. Even the ""taquero"" has those social skills for having a good chat with costumers while they wait for those juicy tacos.Sometimes, to get in the Mexican mood they play some football (soccer) matches on their TV. Most of them Mexican League matches. You can always enjoy this with a Dos-Equis beer, or a Sidral Mundet if you are into Mexican fountain drinks. I once came here for a breakfast and it was surprisingly good. Why hasn't anyone else told me that they serve good sweet Mexican bread here? Concha lovers you got a deal here to dip them in some chocolate milk. So, Mexican Seal of approval (once you enter you'll realize most costumers are Mexican), good for those fast-food cravings, and for Mexican food lovers. Important tip: CASH ONLY, they do have an ATM in the back, but you can always come prepared."

/user_details?userid=BhEVWigmemmc_k1BHtWcxw,Aaron P.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My daughter and I were blown away by everything we had. Don't miss the little black bean soup or the lingua tacos. We ate 11 tacos in five varieties, soup, a quesadilla, flautitas, a flan and a cheesecake with a couple horchatas, a beer and another soda. A total pig out. And it was so affordable. As good as some of the street tacos in Los Angeles and just as cheap! Great service. Keen and friendly. Great surprise in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"A friend recommended this place to us. It looks scratchy like a fast food joint but it was a bang for your bucks and packed with flavours. The server was very friendly and made some really good recommendations to us. Their tacos, sandwiches were so good. Same as their sauces. Beware that the most spicy one is really spicy! The medium one worked the best for me as a accompany to all of my dishes. However, their desserts were very disappointing. The pudding was very bitter and the cheesecake was rock hard. But it worth the long walk from dt Montreal to mt royal."
/user_details?userid=2gJIBTsSZmxsI1SMiuI8UQ,Thy N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I glad that my friend recommended me this place! otherwise i will forget. The place is not fancy and it is not a tex-mex restaurant. The tacos are very good. My favorite is al pastor! Even my sister and my so love the al pastor. I read some review that the tacos are small. I don't know what the size usually is, but for me it was good size and good portion. I ate an entree and 7 tacos and i was full. The price is not expensive, very reasonably. The service is a bit slow, like one server, but she is friendly. Expect no guacamole, no sour cream and no margarita because usually? taqueria don't have these. And more important, it is cash only."

After looking over the menu, I asked about chicken, not available - ok. Next, I asked for some gauc, and again - no. I said can you bring some avocado and she said ok definitely can be done - awesome! They charge for cilantro.. which is just ODD!I got barely quarter of an avocado for $1.25?!?!?! Are you actually serious??The food was kind of mediocre, felt much to be desired AND I was still hungry afterwards."

My gfs and I come to this place on a monthly basis almost. Not much decor or ambiance; it's a chill, unpretentious place. The tacos are simple; 3-4 ingredients at most. Just the way a taco is meant to be. And the sauces are to die for! My mouth just watered..."
/user_details?userid=LY-KaOJyXzbwZyqjQfl7xA,Álex G.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"ok mexican food is mysteriously difficult to find in montreal, and this was my first try at tortas. the torta was comparatively tiny to what i'm used to. the meat was ok, overall average torta. we took food to go since there were no seats, but i think a hot warm torta from here would be better than the cold one i brought home so ill give it 4 stars. the waitress was suuuuuuper busy and there were only two cooks so i felt bad! maybe next time ill catch 'em on a better day."

On the plus side ..Great selection, friendly staff , quick service and great taste. On the minus side (like many latin restos)..decor..decor..decor but they DO have a great terrasse to enjoy the good meal"

/user_details?userid=jxcXExWgrObwx5AL8-LMbA,Nazim A.,"Downtown, Canada",4 star rating,"You have to assume this place is authentic Mexican when everyone in the restaurant is Mexican except yourself. The food is great, the service is friendly and the ambience is inviting. This is definitely a spot I will visit again. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because there is absolutely no English in the restaurant which is typically ok because I have a good understanding of French however, when I asked the waiter and waitress to explain a few ingredients to me they had a lot of trouble. Another knock would be that when I ordered 2 different styles of tacos, they tasted very similar and finally they do not accept credit cards. Other than that I have to say the place is great and I also think that the sauces that they give are amazing. I will be back!"
/user_details?userid=i_NTNrmzEx4deupgjMj-cA,Abril B.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,Their tacos and tortas are exactly what you could eat in Mexico. The staff is very nice and courteous and  the place is nice too. I particularly liked the posters explaining the proper taco etiquette.Good place to practice your Spanish too.

They have some of the typical tacos you'd find in a place in mexico. The horchata water hit the spot too, its a thing to tried. We tried tortas too,  (Mexican sandwich) and it deserve an opportunity too.I gave them 4 stars just because they didn't accept card, all must to be in cash. But the service is very good and the decoration is nice too."

We ordered a couple of different things to give it a try and let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. We tried the Pastor, Bistek and Chorizo. Hands down, Chorizo (although a tad too salty) was the absolute best! This place really reminds me of authentic Mexican food. You will not be disappointed. A must try!"

La Matraca is pretty authentic, as far as I'm concerned. Extremely efficient and fast service (like a real taqueria), great and cheap food. Do yourself a favor, order some tacos al pastor, some horchata, and enjoy Mexico in Montreal :)"
/user_details?userid=wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,Elle O.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hubby and I really like this place but are aware that it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Sure prices seem reasonable (one taco for ~$2-3? Pile them on!) but I can easily eat 5 tacos and that's before I venture into the appetizers and sandwich territory. We don't order drinks and we have yet to eat there for less than $45 for two people. It's tricky because you feel like you should be paying half that price for food and atmosphere that's basically fast-food, but there are not a lot of Mexican-style taco (soft shell, not hard shell) options around here so you take what you can get. We've probably tried all the taco varieties and usually get a bunch of those (~10? can't go wrong with any of them, although personally I'm a fan of the pastor, and hubby loves the chorizo) plus a torta and appetizer to split, and we need to be rolled out the door when we're done."
/user_details?userid=UvZKaPFy85iPjoB2Aj40kQ,Oleg R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The most authentic Mexican place in town. Hands down. You won't find valet, table cloths, D-D waitresses, or champagne here. Instead, you will find some very authentic mexican tacos with good queso, pasztor, and all other goodies. Drinks are simple. You get your standard Mexican Jumex, Jarritos, and other Mexican drinks as well as some Mexican beers. Food is great. All tacos are awesome. Pasztor is properly done. La Gringa deserves special mention. La Matraca sandwich is mind-blowing. Especially combined with one of their 3 signature sauces (which I literally spooned). Their terrace is not bad, however it is facing busy St. Denis. Good for watching your car not to get a ticket. Bad to relax. Oh, and they should definitely throw out those disgustingly uncomfortable wooden terrace chairs. All in all - great mexican food, cheap, and authentic. I understand it is hard for Mexicans to get to Montreal (2 borders to cross is much harder than 1). Finally some arrived ;-)"

I was not full but it's not what they a promising I guess.Tacos + hibiscus drink = around $15. I would go there for special occasions because for that price you can easily have a good dinner somewhere else. But again this is street food, more of a tasting and enjoying spot than. Getting full."

The food was decent, and the sauces/salsas they serve are pretty good. The oxcacan cheese quesadillas  are some of our favorite (we make them at home), so we were glad to see them on the menu. I tried a torta with 3 meats. It was good, but the bread wasn't very tasty. My husband had the pastor tacos and thought they were good, but the raw onions and pineapple overpowered the flavor of the meat."

Bummer, since I really wanted to try this place :-("

We got the pork quesadillas. Didn't taste that Mexican but still really delicious. The entrées are also really good.

Mind you, the place was pretty dead when we got there and slowly picked up for the dinner rush. I ordered the marinated pork tacos, as they state that they are known for their tacos, and boy oh boy! As a die-hard Mexican food snob, I'm happy to say that La Matraca is authentic, delicious, and well priced. Quite easily, the best tacos in Montreal. Forget the imitators, for real tacos, this is the place to beat!"

We like the place very much. Tacos are small but delicious at great price I could easily eat 10 of them myself. They serve tacos with homemade sauce (3 kinds) and they taste very authentic. Even their sandwiches are great. Take a sip of mexican beer and a bite of beef taco, it will send you to heaven."

I had been trying to find good, ""authentic"" Mexican food in Montreal during the three years I've been living here, with little luck, until I finally found La Metraca while wandering along St. Denis. I began to get my hopes up after reading the menu (which was actually in Spanish!), and the food did not disappoint! Absolutely delicious tacos, and I'm dying to go back.The service was a bit slow, but the terrace outside was packed with people. Still gets my 5 stars. This place definitely deserves a higher yelp rating than it currently has."

I really don't know much about Mexican food so my descriptions are for the lay-men to this cuisine... they make this little tacos and mine had chorizo in it - how can you go wrong?! Also, I got horchata which I had only known about because vampire weekend makes catchy songs and it was also very good - think eggnog for the vegan (it is actually a rice-based milk drink with cinnamon and things!). Anyway, I will definitely go back!! The tacos are supah cheap and it is the type of restaurant where you can say ""give me one of everything!"" and actually afford it!"
/user_details?userid=lHealtcrqKk_L01mlM0GGw,CL Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of the best Taco places in town. I go almost every week when I can. Their chorizo tacos are the bomb and my go to. My boyfriend loves the suadero tacos. What you cannot miss are the home made hot sauces that they have. You can't really find them elsewhere and they make the food much more heavenly if you love spice. The service is very quick and there restaurant is big enough so you never have to wait for a table.
/user_details?userid=i8kpPvIy8gVrKxZizdLGTQ,Jim M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"La Matraca is a good place casual place to grab some Mexican soft shell tacos for lunch or dinner.  With higher quality and authentic ingredients, you're also going to pay a bit more than a standard fast food taco spot.  4 medium sized tacos and a beer will set you back in the neighborhood of $16.On my trips to La Matraca I stick to the carnitas tacos with cheese and haven't been disappointed.  The variety of salsas served with the meal add some great flavors to the meal.If you're looking for tortilla chips, nachos, salsa, or guacamole, you've come to the wrong place.  La Matraca takes pride in their authenticity.The waitstaff is helpful and kind.  Be sure to calculate your bill and ask for a printed receipt.  I've had an issue a couple of time where they were $5-7 off on my order.  It's enough of an annoyance that I bumped them down from 4 to 3 stars.  Even with that issue, if  I'm in the mood for taco, La Matraca is the place in the neighborhood to get my fix."
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice Mexican food, I liked it. Reasonable price. They say they want to be as close as possible to a Mexican taqueria, so there are no chips with guac or salsa, which are not traditional Mexican. The ambiance is very casual; would be nice if it were just a bit fancier. Service was pretty good. They charged us too much at first but my husband noticed so they recomputed and gave us the correct amount of change afterwards."
