This came as a recommendation from a yelp collection I looked at, and i highly highly recommend this place as well. Walked over for a quick bite. This place is very charming. From what I can tell, it's been under the same family ownership since it's opening WAY back in the day. I got their special, which is basically a sandwich with cheese and salami. The salami is delicious, the cheese perfectly melty, and the pickles a nice touch. They also do home made sodas. Price point is unbeatable as well. *cash only."
/user_details?userid=puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,Jason H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Deep in Mile End there is a sandwich joint that's been around since 1932 it specializes in a fried bologna and salami sandwich on roll and has homemade cherry cola - no brand names here - and sour pickles.  When you step in it's like going back in time, nothing has changed except the funny Canadian money. There are rules here that must be followed and they are clearly written in plain view.  ""When ordering a Special, you should know a thing or two, it's always served with mustard, it's never cut for you, don't ask why just understand, that it's nothing new, that's the way it's been done since 1932"".  If you want a light lunch and are in the area you must stop in for the Special at Wilenskys this place is the Bees Knees."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You really can't go wrong here. The food is great, the service is quick, and it's a Montreal classic. There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. The all beef sandwich is amazing. Served pressed and hot, with a sliver of mustard. Although it is quite easy to make at home, it is cheap enough to go here and enjoy their sandwiches. My only 1 negative comment would be that some of the staff could be nicer. I came around 3:40pm and it was my first time here so I wanted to take a moment to read their full ""menu"". One staff immediately said ""you better choose quickly, we close at 4"" in a not so pleasant voice. Apart from this, everything was perfect. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a really quick, tasty and cheap bite to eat."

They've been doing their thing since 1932.We dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon (around 3:00pm). The inside is the definition of old school. 10 wiggling counter stools and some well used, vintage panini presses to cook the sandwiches.The menu is up behind the counter; Wilensky special, hot dogs, cold sandwiches, egg cream soda, soft drinks, milkshakes and other drinks. - Wilensky special with Swiss cheese ($4.53) - sandwich made with beef salami and bologna with mustard and grilled on a roll. It's a perfect snack. Bun is nicely grilled. Worth a try. Cash only and no tipping necessary. 3.5 stars."

The menu is simple yet the focus on high quality fair is existent in every item, as evidenced by the 87 years of existence as well as the crowds that it draws. What drew me was the chopped egg sammich with egg cream soda (made from scratch as you pick out the flavor). This is a must when in these neighborhoods."

I occasionally return when visiting. Went back this time decided to try cheese on my special for the first time, and for some reason they gave me a mutant special that was like 2x-3x the size of a normal one. The second one was regular size :)I always get pickels and karnatzel and a home made soda (they mix the syrup and soda water by hand).  Worth a visit."
/user_details?userid=NhWQDZs52uGQ0SvuBjJGAQ,Masa K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"What does heaven taste like? It tastes like a hot and crispy Kaiser roll, melty cheddar (or Swiss) cheese, thin salty slices of beef salami and bologna, and a big ol' squizz of yellow mustard. All that paired with some sour (or half-sour) pickles and a hand-mixed cherry cola. That's what heaven tastes like, yo. All that for $7 or so. Change can be donated to charity or lost in your couch cushions. I could crush ten of those sandwiches after a night of drinking, kinda like a Jewish Crave Case."

Adam and I take lots of late night walks and this place closes at 4pm and isn't open on Sunday AND it's cash only! A recipe for me never being able to go basically. But one day I was like enough! Go to the bank, get the money, eat there!!! And I did. And I loved it! It's simple, delicious food. I got the kernatzel, the chocolate milkshake, the special with cheese, AND the hot dog and yuuuuummm. I think it's the meat that gets me. It's so tasty and salty and then they add a light dab of mustard with some cheddar cheese and boom = happiness. It may be cash only but it's also ridiculously cheap."

There's a reason it has over 4 stars with only a few items on the menu. It's so simple and good! The special doesn't look like much but it's so tasty, salty and tangy with the mustard. The hot dog was so good on the onion top bun. I loved it! The service was beyond fast. The place has this rustic, original look like it hasn't changed since it opened in 1932."

The fact is, the 'sandwich' is inedible. I've never seen more than three people at a time there. The soda fountain is great though, as is the ambience.  have no idea how they make enough money to stay in business, since very little that they offer tastes good or is nutritious."

I never ate a bologna sandwich as a kid, but this place has been making it famous since 1932 so why not? Wilensky felt like walking back in time to a bygone era. Few of such places are still around so you have to appreciate a family run business still going strong  for 8 decades. I liked the softness of the bun and the sandwich overall was a good pick me up at the moment."
/user_details?userid=TVl-6rwmk98I0mHLIKGjVg,Jean K.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"An institution I was curious to try. Felt like a museum. I thought the experience of sitting in this historic restaurant was worth the price of admission (the sandwich). The sandwich was decent but had been built up so much, Its very simple. Just as tasty as your average ham and cheese sandwich. Fun interesting experience. Service is nice. Worth going to, but I wouldn't call it an amazing culinary experience."
/user_details?userid=CgQsF5wV1_vz5KSBghYCwQ,Tom T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The five stars are because they've been doing their thing, the same way, without any f**s given to changing trends and tastes, since 1932!!Travel and Leisure magazine has called this one of the world's best sandwiches, Anthony Bourdain has been here and Mordecai Richler wrote about it in the Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. They have a simple menu and rules. Yes, don't forget the rules! 1) they don't cut the sandwich in half, 2) they won't add or remove any ingredient in the sandwich, except cheese. 3) there is no tipping...but if you insist, the money is donated to the heart and stroke foundation.  I asked the waitress what to order, she was friendly to this outsider and patient with me while I was soaking up 80+ years of history.  I ordered what you should too, the Wilensky special, no cheese (it's the right thing to do) and house made cherry cola. The $4.99 iconic sandwich consists of one slice of baloney and four or five slices of salami heated on what seems to be vintage panini grills behind the counter. It's finished with a squeeze of mustard on unique bread, best described as what you get when an english muffin and kaiser have a baby dusted in cornmeal. While they do have a couple other menu items, this is what to order when you drop by. I had a second to go, they're small, but flavourful!"

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I can't believe this place has only 65 reviews!As far as I'm concerned, Wilensky's hype is on the same level as Schwartz's - except that the former stayed humble, and the later built a whole empire that boasts worldwide renown and Celine Dion. The Wilensky Special is just a grilled bologna sandwich, plain and simple. It can only be praised so much for its culinary achievements, but can be adored endlessly if you happen to be fond of the diner's cultural significance and nostalgic vibe.Wilensky is frozen in time, with its funny wall color, cheap prices and casual chit chat. There's no huge lineup out the door, obnoxious service or sense of urgency - althought the hype whipped up by Anthony Bourdain and others has given the place a strange sacred aura. The first time I stepped into the place, I thought it was surprisingly old, like a museum that refuses to modernize. They didn't really ride any wave of the publicity, and you'll never find their bologna sandwich sold anywhere outside of their shop - and I think I like them for that.It seems that Wilensky is still a well kept secret - one of many hidden around the Plateau and Mile-End. It earned its place by staying consistently delicious, close to its community and true to its origins and family values.Note: I usually don't like soda, but I actually really enjoyed theirs!"

/user_details?userid=RbCH1Z_WClQmeA7--V1KcA,Mark G.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because Anthony Bourdain is a genius and told me to come here. Not because it's the best breakfast sandwich ever made. But because this place is a time capsule stuck in history. As soon as you walk in, you've instantly warped back to 1928. The woman behind the counter didn't say hi or hello. She said, how many? Lol I loved it. My first ever chocolate egg cream soda brought me back to my Jewish roots. And yes the sandwich was most definitely perfect with a squirt of mustard. Less than 7 bucks spent, I was more than satisfied. In fact if I lived here, I'd probably have a sandwich everyday."

It really adds so much to the sandwich. Line moved quick, sandwiches were cheap, AND I was pretty full.The sandwich will make you feel nostalgic, and so will the décor. Full of old school CDs and books."

That sandwich is gross.  I'm not a big fan of bologna to begin with (not sure who is...), I felt almost bad because the staff is pretty watchful, but I couldn't get through half of it.

He talked it up so much, I have to say I was disappointed. But what the food lacked, the place made up for in charm. The place has been around forever and it seems like the staff has, too. We talked about all the cool stuff on their walls, like the low prices of housing in the 30's. My family is from Montreal, so I'm pretty sure my grandparents hung out here in their childhood, so it's pretty cool that it's still around."
/user_details?userid=DEjRvKAJWCrjCaEP-FVJ-g,Dana H.,"Portland, OR",5 star rating,"I couldn't believe how much I loved this sandwich. Look at that photo. It looks so ordinary, but it's so perfect. We walked in right at 9am, and the perfectly grumpy guy behind the counter had to take our order like 5 times before it registered in his brain. For West-coasters who have only seen this behavior in movies, it was so delightfully spot on. The truly hilarious part: there was nothing about our order that was hard to remember. We each got a Wilensky special with Swiss, a pickle, and a cherry cola (that's the order 99% of their clientele always get). It was so funny. The important part is that he got it right, and cooked it right. Pastrami, bologna, yellow mustard, all pressed into a roll...thing. Looks like an English muffin. Tastes like...not...that. Whatever. It's good. It's served not on a plate, but on a thin napkin on the counter in front of you. The man behind the counter warmed up to us and told us the story behind the place. We chatted about Portland and Montreal for a good 15 minutes as we were the only ones there at 9am (by the way, this sandwich makes a great breakfast). If I sound like I'm complaining about that guy, I'm not. The man is a true gem. As others have pointed out, there's no substitutions allowed. None are needed. You just have to trust that they know what they're doing."

/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",5 star rating,"Wilensky's has been around since '32 and was opened up by Moe Wilensky.  Originally located on St. Urbain and Fairmount, the restaurant has been at its current location since '52.  It's currently run by the wife, Ruth, and her children, Asher and Sharon.  The hubs and I came here and we were surprised at how it seemed as if we traveled back in time.  There was only counter seating, so we just made ourselves comfortable on the stools.  They are famous for their 'Special,' which is grilled beef salami and grilled beef bologna, topped with mustard, all set on a kaiser roll, which is then pressed flat on the grill - you can have a side of sweet or sour pickles (I recommend the sour) - it was a lovely combination!  The sandwich itself isn't greasy at all, but just crispy from being pressed; the beef salami and the bologna were meaty and tasty, and I loved the simplicity of them only being topped with mustard.  I also had to get their hand-mixed soda, so I got their special cherry soda - it was delicious!  Ms. Sharon was super sweet and was super informative, and she had a great sense of humor.  The place has been featured on magazines and on food shows, but the fame doesn't seem to faze them at all (there was even a local newspaper photographer who was there, just taking pictures).  Definitely a cute little gem to check out :D+the Wilensky 'Special'+sour pickles+handmixed cherry soda+ask for Ms. Sharon :D"

If you don't know what kind of cheese to choose, I would recommend the swiss cheese over the cheddar as the former is a bit milder, which would enhances the flavor of the sandwich. I regret not ordering the pickles and their soda as I heard Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and there are so many flavors to choose from!"
/user_details?userid=ElHlstlOwu3aSOgJASDiIw,Malcolm L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place so much. It really does feel like going back in time. There aren't many places that can do just one thing, and do that thing well. The service is friendly but to the point. This isn't a place you spend hours at. Just walk in, take a seat at the bar, and order a special, a milk cream (cola is delicious!) and some pickles. Be sure to add a little extra mustard if that's your kind of thing. Don't ask for your special to be cut in half, or for any special requests. Just accept that this place has been around almost 85 years, making the same specials, and maybe the way they do things is for a reason."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After hearing so many things about this famed place from various food critics and personalities, I finally decided, on a particularly humid Montréal day, to check out this place for myself and see if it was worth all the hype. I proceeded to order the most common meal here - a cherry coke, a Special with Swiss, and a sour pickle. In my opinion, everything was A-ok, and upon first glance it stereotypically looked like what I jokingly call ""white people food,"" except it was actually pretty good and tasted better than it looked. As someone who doesn't particularly like lunch meats, the bologna was actually pretty tasty and the Swiss cheese/bread combination complemented it nicely. The mustard, however, didn't come through for whatever reason. Maybe the sourness of the pickle I was eating at the same time ended up drowning out the flavor? I don't know, but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite Western condiments. As for the cherry cola, classic fountain drinks always give me a cool vibe, as if it could make a person cooler just by drinking out of a glass of it. For a place with so much history to it, it didn't disappoint on that aspect.Overall, come here for the old-school vibe if you're in the mood for a throwback and some simple, cheap eats. Maybe I'll go back and see if I can actually taste the mustard in the future..."

But I don't get it. It's a seared baloney sandwich. It's to Montreal what spam is to Hawaii. Do you yearn for spam? If yes, by all means go to Wilensky's. Otherwise, I'd pass. In all states of the world, good Montreal smoked meat dominates - first time and millionth time."

When you walk into this deli you are transported into a 30s? 50s? 60s? style deli with classic stools and counter top. Their signature sandwich is great for a snack and is perfect to satisfy the hunger of those who are not well read in historical interior decorations. Seating was limited but I got mine to go as there are plenty of outdoor seating in the neighborhood and I was here during a nice fall day and was not given any indication that the weather in Montreal will not always be pleasant, so I assume that this is year round. My only gripe is that this place was not fully embracing their historical decor and offering soda for nickel and candy for a copper... and giving 1 cent coins in change."

If you accept this and that this is not a healthy lunch, you can be satisfied with the lunch at wilensky's.I walked there from my office and took it to go. I had 2 special wilensky's sandwich, one with Swiss cheese and one with no cheese. If you are hesitating between the two, my answer is simple: go with the one with cheese. The standard one is a good comfort food but the one with cheese is so much better. The cheese melts completely and the taste of Swiss goes really well with the salami if the sandwich.Also try their soft drink. They are homemade and tastes really good. One warning though, don't expect it to taste like your commercial version of the drinks like Coca-Cola or Pepsi.the taste is different but it's really good"

With the absence of fireproof construction around the cooking appliances and the garage space heat blowing overhead, you gotta wonder about the building codes in Montreal.

After looking it up and seeing good reviews from more than one celebrity chef, we had to go.We walked in and it still has a 1920s feel to it like the kind of delis you see in the old movies. A funny, old man greeted us and ave us their special within literally 30 seconds on a napkin. The sandwich was NOT deep-fat friend and it was literally a bun heated on a panini with layers of meat and kraft slice cheese. I loved it, but I definitely wouldn't give it the best sandwich I ever had award like one celebrity chef called it."

It's a fast eat.  If you really need seats, then know that the turnaround time is quick; nobody lingers.The food is made upon ordering.  It arrives quickly and hot - the sandwiches are served on a napkin.  Tip: order each sandwich as you go, no need to order all 2 or 3 for yourself at once!  The soda fountain is real old-school!  Syrup form!  Many flavours to choose from!  You can separately order pickles - sour or half sour.  The karnatzels are very fresh too.Overall, the staff is warm and friendly.  This place is highly recommended for a quick bite to eat.  The sandwiches are done just right."

His famous novel ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" was also a made into a successful film under the same name.  Wilensky's is present in both the book and film. It was founded by Moe Wilensky in 1932. The family says Moe's father opened a hair salon down the street and sold snacks and sandwiches on the side. One day the Moe bought a panini press for $ 68, which is worth about a 1,000$ a day. His father was shocked by his decision to spend so much money on an electric device, but thanks to it Moe invented the Wilensky special"" -  a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat on the grill. The place is a time capsule for diners of the 30's and they keep it the same as a principles: It's impossible to get the toast without mustard, they never cut the toast in half and employees are not willing to accept a tip. Celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain visits the place in almost every documented to Montreal. This will not be a transcendental experience for the taste buds Yet the old deli, the lines of pressed sandwiches on the grill, decorated by very yellow mustard, and the home-made soda drinks makes you feel like in a live food museum- and that's worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=WFc-UXm8MRY4NTdoXm-pCg,Dylan B.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Wilensky's is a tough place to review. While in Montreal, I ate at Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon. To review those places in the same frame of mind as Wilensky's is unfair. They are striving to accomplish different goals. Here, you'll get an unpretentious, straightforward lunch at incredible speed. You'll enjoy the vibe. The food isn't mind blowing, but is very tasty, in a simple, no frills sort of way.First, the neighborhood Wilensky's is in is awesome. If you're a tourist in Montreal, come here and walk around for a non tourist vibe. Enjoy a special, grab a coffee at Arts Cafe, and then eat again at Fairmont Bagel. Next, the food and drink. The Wilensky Special is salami and bologna served on a toasted roll, topped with mustard. It's a simple sandwich, but it will hit you in all the right spots. It's ready in less than a minute, and you'll likely want two. Order a cherry soda with it - Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and it's very tasty, even if you don't drink soda.Finally, the ambiance. This place is a classic - 1930's era posters cover the wall, all seats are at a bar facing the griddle. Sitting at the bar, chatting with the owner (who is very nice, and patiently answered two questions about Anthony Bourdain while I was there), gives a very relaxing, small town feeling.Come here and enjoy the sandwich. But more so, enjoy the classic, friendly neighborhood vibe it gives off. It'll set the tone for your day."

The place is outdated, but full of character. There's maybe like 10 stools at the bar and you eat there. Up close and personal to the servers who are wonderful people.

Some days nothing else comes close. I recommend ordering yours with Kraft cheese and a side order of half-sours to get the full experience.  And don't forget to order a fountain drink.  An institution (sometimes in more than one sense), and not just because of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.  Beware of imitators--this is the real deal."

There's only one thing that people  order, the Special, a salami and bologna sandwich with mustard. Yes, you have to take the mustard, there's even a sign saying that. You can order one of their fountain sodas, and get a side of pickles. This place has a crazy charm to it. The waiters are very friendly, and the food is always very quick and tasty. This place is definitely a Montreal classic."

I didn't expect much but I took one bite and HOLY MOLY is baloney or whatever is in that sandwich really THAT GOOD? IT was soft and hot and delicious. I really have no idea what I ate, but it was freakin awesome. Prob one of the best things I ate in Montreal. Yup.The actual place is small with less than 15 counter seats. I didn't really notice too much about the place other than the cup of dried sausage they had next to the register for 50 cents. I should have gotten one."

Had the special with cheese and cherry cola. Gotta have the cherry cola.  Also had the half sour pickle, next time trying the sour pickle instead. Only cash."

It certainly is not a classy place. It is not gourmet at all. And its name doesn't suit the place at all: it is NOT a light lunch. However, it a true Montreal institution and a classic.When you go there, there is only thing to order, really: the Wilensky Special. Bread with salami and bologna and mustard. You take two of those along with a cherry coke and a sour pickle and you're good to go. It's open from 10am to 4pm, weekdays only. And you have to remember the rules:""When ordering a specialYou should know a thing or twoThey are always served with mustardThey are never cut in twoDon't ask us why, just understandThat this is nothing newThis is the way that it's been done since 1932."" Oh, and don't dare you give them some tip."
