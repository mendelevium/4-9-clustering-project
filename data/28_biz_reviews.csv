/user_details?userid=oxkRQJo0LXw9owd90CKQQw,Cindy W.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"We found this place after walking around Chinatown when we saw through the window of the restaurant, a man hand pulling the noodles and cooking them fresh to order. We figured this place was pretty authentic and knew we had to try it. We ordered the classic Lanzhou beef noodles and zhajiang mian. We also ordered a side of cucumbers and beef. What I loved about this place was you could choose from a variety of noodle types (thin- thick) and adjust the spice. Our dishes came minutes within ordering and the warm spicy broth was perfect for the chilly weather. The noodles had a nice bite to them, not too chewy and not too hard. The broth was light yet rich with beef flavor and spice. My dad is a native of this region in China where these noodles get their name from and he said these were the best lanzhou noodles he's had in North America. We also ordered the Jazhiang mian which is a bean paste and pork topping. It was very savory and came with a bowl of soup to thin out the sauce to your liking. We loved that dish as well. These were all pretty large portions even for the smaller sizes and are definitely worth the price. I would definitely recommend checking this place out  if you're looking for cheap yet high quality Chinese food in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Huge bowls of fresh noodles with tasty broth, what more could you ask for? This place is perpetually crowded, but thankfully they've expanded seating into the restaurant next door so they can seat more than a few tables. It's situated about the asian grocery store that I go to so sometimes waiting near the entrance is a bit hectic with the in and out + the people standing by the window watching the noodle pulling masters at work. It's great that you can get whatever shape/size noodle you want since they're made completely fresh. The standard beef noodle soup is very tasty and made with thin slices of beef. The large is quite large and should be able to satisfy any noodle soup appetite.  I also love the tendon beef noodles as the meat is a bit more thick and tender . Tea egg and spicy cucumber salad are my favorite sides. I'm glad they're doing delivery/takeout and I'll be glad to eat in person when they can reopen. Noodle soups are a must for a winter that lasts 5 months!"
/user_details?userid=YF3v4Kpyg_YZkb_RTqAKwg,Sarah T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Perfect for the cold rainy weather, warms up your soul. Plus, you get a show of them making the noodles in the window while walking downtown St Laurent. The flavour of the spicy beef soup was spot on (spicy enough to kill germs but not you), the noodles were cooked perfectly and fills you right up. They also have a veggie broth version. Basically pick the soup based, spice level and the noddle size. When they first opened that was literally the only choices you had. They now have a slight more updated menu, but I still stick to the basics. Why change a classic!This time around I got a large to take out (as per new rules) and share at home. Normally I would only get a small and not even finish when I would be downtown. Need to go there when extra hungry...."
/user_details?userid=nJZ7f4AfZKyDKdIZ362mIw,Paul L.,"Longwood, FL",4 star rating,"I was in Montreal just over a year ago, finishing my project with an U.N. agency by presenting the final results. Being in Montreal that time of the year was a treat enough, and getting an upgrade to a huge suite at the Embassy Suite was a bonus, but having dining options while there for the 2 days was the cherry on top. On this particular evening, I was just out for something by way of comfort food in the China town area, when I came upon this 5-star place on my Yelp app. Since it's almost literally a hole-in-the-wall (I mean, they don't even have their own bathroom - you have to go to that decrepit Chinese grocery store in the basement or up one floor for that convenience), previous Yelpers had provided ample warning about the crowd; sure enough, even at close to 9 o'clock on a Sunday night, there was still a line out the door, albeit a shorter line. The clientele comprised mainly college students, solo or in pairs, which is just as well - the seat I got for myself faces the wall, which doesn't create much of a romantic setting. Kitchen is right there within your sight and earshot. Your dinner is brought to you pretty swiftly (need the fast turnover of tables, baby!) Most of the offering is varieties of soup noodles - I chose the one with different meats ($14 CAD), slightly spicy version, which had enough of a kick for my taste, unless I'm in the mood to be numbed. Noodles are house-made, and yes, every bit as good as the hype. One star taken off, rightly or not, for the somewhat uncomfortable setting."
/user_details?userid=-hsfXvAvAZuGkm5JZTQ5Bw,Katherine W.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I've had hand-pulled noodles in China + all different Chinatowns, and this place is high on the list! The noodles come in different sizes and the broth is so, so fresh. I'd recommend a medium or small; the large looks pretty tough to finish! I was in and out of the restaurant in 30 minutes, so this is definitely a quick meal, but expect a decently long wait time."
/user_details?userid=lxGwbMkC_I9D7GhGT23mFQ,Cynthia L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I work nearby so this noodle place is a huge hit for me and my coworkers. They have freshly pulled noodles which they pull at the front of their restaurant if you're looking for a little show before your meal. I've only ever tried their lan zhou pulled noodle which you can get in a couple of different sizes (small med large or xl) and you can choose to get a spicy broth (which is the same broth they use for the non spicy but they add some chili oil). Comes with a few slices of thinly sliced beef, coriander, and turnip. The broth is very tasty and the noodles are also quite good. I have also tried their spicy cucumber salad which is topped with crushed peanuts (so avoid if you have allergies!) I am giving this place only 4 stars because it is quite small so once all the seats are filled you have to wait outside (or get it to go). Also the quality of the cucumber salad has its good days and days where its just ok. But the pulled noodle soup is great so that is worth trying here!"
/user_details?userid=CdjhLoudvFZ2VfVIvGxL3g,Yun C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Super delicious freshly made noodles! Texture is great and you have many choices for the thickness of the noodle (5 levels?). I think the thin or 2nd level thickness were the best. We tried the thickest level and thought that was too thick. The line easily gets long however it moves fast since service is quick. You get your food within minutes of ordering. Only limiting factor is how fast each customer eats. The beef noodle is the best item with a clear broth that is very flavorful. You can select to get spicy or nonspicy. I was also loving the marinated edamame. The spicy cucumber was just ok. I tried the vegetables broth and it wasn't that good. The noodle is still nicely al dente! They take credit card, located in Chinatown above a Chinese market. Sitting next to the bar was a nice treat as we got to watch them make the noodles. It's Michelin bib gourmand. It's cheap, quick and delicious! We came back one more time during our short trip in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=GHnnA42a8rRNXhhdQLM9Rg,Ria K.,"Fairfax, VA",5 star rating,"A random stop in the small Chinatown in Montreal led us here- we were drawn by the no-frills attitude, lack of English and French service, and window display where noodles were being made to order, in addition to the random location above the escalator to a grocery store.There are not many seats, and consequently we waited about 30 minutes to be seated as a party of 4, but I would say that it was certainly worth the wait.Something unique about this place is that you can choose the type of noodles that you would like, and this ranges from both the type of noodle (round or flat) as well as the thickness. It's worth noting that your noodles are actually just one long noodle!!My friend got the Dan Dan noodles, which she said were reminiscent of her home back in China- to which our other Chinese friend agreed strongly with. I got the Beef Noodle Special with thick flat noodles, as did my friend- it hit the spot on this cold day, and was super flavorful with the spicy chili oil in addition to a rich broth and slices of beef.I'm glad we randomly stopped by, and I would certainly recommend this to friends."
/user_details?userid=ia5kvJxYR8gPItl9O4W0Mg,Tzarina W.,"Chandler, AZ",4 star rating,Looking for a Taiwanese noodle staple especially during the winter season this hit the spot for us. Super small  establishment but still fit at least 30ish or so. Lan zhao beef noodle soup and Dan Dan noodle were the picks for dinner plus a couple side boiled tea eggs. Noodles were perfectly cooked for both dishes. LAN zhao soup was delightful as well.
/user_details?userid=X0NJT_YrZg6-U9oRGJcYKQ,Eric B.,"Lewisville, TX",3 star rating,"It was Ok but not for me.Just like my opening line states it was ok.Yea it was cool to see the guys hand pull the noodles in the window and it was cool to see another china town in another city, but that is it .For me:1.The wait in line because of VERY limited seating.2.The VERY cramped seating.3.The customers for the downstairs grocery store walking through the middle of the restaurant because the stairs are in the middle of the restaurant.Just kind of took away from the experience and made it uncomfortable having to constantly move and lean out of the way.When it was time to pay I was not allowed to pay at the table , I had to stand up and take 2 steps toward the register which I could reach seating at the table. This sounds like no big deal but were I had to stand to pay was in the one path to get to all the tables so I had to stand side ways to allow people to pass me.What a mess = talk about squeezing every dollar or cad out of every foot of a business.You like this kind of adventure go for it . You will not be waiting in line on me to finish food here ."
/user_details?userid=yIXLkXiXdP7EvdLDKB3cxg,Nancy H.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I'm not a fan of this type of noodle soup but if you like clear broth this will be your jam! Hand pulled noodles of the flat kind or the round kind and you get to choose your width/thickness, respectively. The noodles are simple, al dente, and satisfying. You can watch as they slam the dough in the front to make the noodles! A fellow diner recommended getting the special lanzhou beef noodle combo because you get a bang for your buck. $13CAD for a veggie app and noodle soup that comes with their hard boiled tea egg. Get it spicy or sans spicy. Spicy isn't really spicy to be honest but adds to the flavor. If someone wanted to go again, I'd go again and order the braised beef tendon noodles (it's a chef recommended dish too!) The line gets long here so be prepared to wait! It's a tiny hole in the wall that shares it's space with an escalator to the grocery store in the basement. If you need to go to the bathroom, good luck navigating because it's a 10 step process. Great service. Lemon water refills. Once you're done eating get up to pay by the service station."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good but not worth the wait line. I had the soup with the thickest round noodles. The broth tasted very much like traditional pho. I was expecting something different. The fresh noodles are amazing and I love watching them get made, it's so fascinating. The portions are huge. I had the small and could barely finish it. The meat was pretty good and tender nothing special. The egg was nice, it actually did take abit like tea. I had the algae/potato salad. I RARELY use this word but I hated it. I've had seaweed salad before, the glossy sushi restaurant type but this was completely different. Crunchy texture and it tasted like fishy slime. I had to add alot of spicy sesame paste they had on the table to make it bearable. The service was very fast no complaints there. All in all its a good place but if there's a lineup don't bother."
/user_details?userid=syCxRdiP-0XJenWpJ8L02g,Cindy L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm so happy to have stopped by here whilst I was in Montreal for a short visit. I highly recommend this place and yes there are line ups but it's worth it. Seating is very limited and don't expect a fancy noodles shop with exceptional seating but expect amazing hand pulled noodles. There is also an open kitchen concept which allows you to see the noodles being prepared. The prices here are reasonable as well. I ordered the Special Nouilles de boeuf Lanzhou (large) to share with my boyfriend + Lanzhou Beouf Hoison. The texture of the hand pulled noodles was perfect and hands down best noodles we have had so far. How I wish I lived in Montreal so I could have these more often. If ever in Chinatown, stop by for a visit and you definitely will not regret it. Happy eating!"

Delighted to find delicious Chinese noodles in Montreal, which did not disappoint.

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you need hot spicy soup, then come here. You get to choose the kind of noodles you want based on width, The servings are huge, a medium will stuff you silly so don't even go for a large. Between the meat and the noodles some veggies this is I guess Chinese fast food and much much better than McDonald's. Still this is not a place to linger for a very long, people usually walk in, order the soup, get in within a minute or two, slurp it all up and leave, The staff are young, service is very brisk and I'd say there's a very utilitarian mindset and ethos here."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is small but a true jewel. The Braised beef gristle noodle is an amazing dish. The medium size is indeed for a large appetite. Nevertheless, one can always ask the dish for to-go. This spot is crowded but small, so if you are a large group (more than 4) you may have to wait. This place is good to come in couple or 3. Sometimes the wait can last up to 30 minutes. The place is quick, and the staff is mostly in a rush. The food is amazing. I could rate this place makes the 2nd best noodles in Montreal. So get ready to eat a lot, and leave with a big smile and a big tummy."

The flavours are amazing, the portions are however big , but it'd completely worth every penny. The only negative aspects is that it's part of the mall which is okay as long as you don't mind the excess noise and also it's very small ( first come first serve basis)  ."

Food was awesome. Service was helpful, food comes out fast. I got the Dan dan noodles and it was perfect balance of flavor. It comes with some spice (and I'm not a spicy person at ALL) but it wasn't too much. I got the seaweed salad - it was good but not like I'm used to so I can't say my favorite. We had to share a table, not a big deal and everyone is crammed in anyway."
/user_details?userid=vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA,Nataly N.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Maybe I've been spoiled by a similarly-named noodle shop in one of my US hometowns, but after so much anticipation to try the beef noodles here, I felt a bit underwhelmed. While the broth had a nice kick to it, it was way too salty, and the beef slices were thin, a bit scanty, and very dry and chewy - not tender and melt-in-your-mouth like I've had at other places.Also, I did not realize there was such a range of noodle thickness, and while I showed the waitress a picture of the noodles I wanted, it seems there was a miscommunication and I ended up with extra-wide noodles, which, while fresh, heavily dominated over the thin beef slices in terms of texture. If you are very hungry and crave noodles on a cold day, this place will be adequate, but sadly, it's not the best hand-drawn noodles out there."

A small here is a medium elsewhere, a medium here is a large elsewhere, etc.Delicious hand made noodles, soup base is good if you just ask for a little spicy.

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Another spot in Chinatown where you can get your hand pulled noodle fix. Look for the grocery store (Marché G&D)/all the people peering into the glass window watching the noodle master in awe. Both times there was a line to grab a table. The inside is small with two seats at the noodle bar and about 30 seats for the rest.The menu is short and sweet (less than 10 items). Again, the menu out front is different than the one they give you inside. Look for the combo option!Trip #1I dropped in Sunday for a pre-dinner and was surprised to see it packed.- Lan Zhou special beef noodles combo ($10.97 small) - you choose a side, get a tea egg and spiciness. I picked the spicy cucumber salad which had a satisfyingly crunchy bite and touch of heat. The noodles were fresh, chewy and toothsome. Broth was clean tasting and homey. Think simplicity; they let the noodles shine.Trip #2Second time, we dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:00pm).- Lan Zhou special beef noodles combo ($10.97 small)- Noodle with homemade pork sauce ($10.99) - noodles are homemade and again, toothsome bite. Crazy amount in one bowl (it's a medium). Pork was way too salty.Still a solid spot in my books to get hand pulled noodles. Debit and cash only."
/user_details?userid=GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"As good as I would expect from a popular restaurant, though not uniquely delicious. And that's perfectly fine! My mother loves 牛肉面湯 (beef noodle soup) and we figured we might as well eat here while we were visiting Montreal. The beauty of the beef noodle soup here is that you can choose the width and size of your noodles because they make their noodles in-house. That's amazing.There are so many widths and sizes to choose from, my indecisive heart almost could not handle it. I opted for 二細 (""2-xì"" lit. ""2-thin"") which was cylindrical and relatively thick, and it was just right for me. My mother got the 寬(""kuān"" lit. ""wide"") which was definitely wide relative to my 2-xì. They were both good and chewy. Our bowls were huge! Makes the price definitely worth it.I don't know if it was a function of the noodles in general being the soup for long, but when I was helping my mom finish her kuān noodles, they seemed to have dissolved slightly into the soup, making them more doughy than I wanted. I know they make the noodles fresh (you can see them make it in the shop which is super cool). I liked my 2-xì noodles."

/user_details?userid=ZGTuCOVq7I4bsyypXAFcLw,Diana C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"The beef noodle soup is huge! They have Small, Medium, Large sizes and my friend and I split a medium but the bowl looked huge. It actually was a lot of broth but not as many noodles as you would think. We weren't super hungry so the medium was a perfect size for us to split. The beef broth was clear, flavorful and had a nice sweet tanginess. You can customize the thickness of the noodles and we just chose regular which looks like spaghetti noodles. The beef was thinly cut and tender.Delicious, hearty and filling - a bowl of beef noodles will warm you up during the cold winter months. And the best part is the noodle shop also has a downstairs escalator that goes to an Asian supermarket so you can pick up some drinks or snacks on your way out. The downstairs market is amazing since they have like Chinese Lay's with unique flavors like cucumber and grilled eel + Hojicha Kit-Kats that I thought were a Kyoto-exclusive."

Just be prepared for other people to have the exact same idea.....which means waiting your turn. The location is more of a fast-food set up for noodles, because 'the restaurant' wraps around an escalator that leads down to a grocery store. There are tables on a back platform, several lining the wall, and a couple stools by the door. At peak hours, each seat is full of slurping away at their noodles. Thankfully it means that the turnover is quick and you get a turn soon.The menu is small, will less than 5 soup options and several noodle types for mix and match. There are some small side-dishes that can be ordered as an add-on. My bowl felt large even though I did not order a larger size, which means that there are plenty of noodles and soup. I had the veggie soup with the flat thin noodles and it was delicious. The soup had a great depth of flavor and the noodles were made perfectly."

The cucumber, like most reviewers said, aren't that good but that's just a small side dish anyway. Lacks salt and spice. The special beef noodle soup is out of this world though. The broth, first of all, is so hearty and flavorful. I ordered the 2nd smallest circular noodles and thought it was still slightly big. I'd go with the smallest noodles or the smallest flat noodles, just based on texture. The taste is so good though. Also, when you walk in, the bowls that you think are the Large bowls are actually Medium! I'm a big eater but the medium bowl was more than enough. Serving portions are huge!!

We were lucky to arrive early as the shop is small so seating would be hard to get later. The menu offered a variety of noodles and allows one to pick the thickness and style of noodles for the dish. The portion size can also be selected as well. We both picked the shop's specialty which is called ""special nouilles de boeuf"" with flat noodles and in a medium size, but different thickness levels. For the level of spiciness, we both went with mild. The food arrived shortly and both medium size bowls were quite big with plenty of noodles and a decent serving of beef. The noodles has a nice chewy texture and the broth was light and refreshing with hints of chili oil as I only asked for mild. The downside was that my noodles stuck together because I did not stir it in the beginning to separate it. It was quite chilly the day we went so the noodles warmed us both up. I think this is a great place to have a bowl of noodles if one is ever around the area."

I am glad I tried this noodle place as it was on my Montreal's chinatown bucket list.  I enjoyed watching the guy making the noodle in the front window.I recommend it if you want authentic beef noodles.

We were hungry, so we agreed to share a table with another couple.  It was a bit awkward (they may have been on a date going south?!?) but once the giant bowls of food arrived, that consumed everyone's attention. Once you decide what dish you want, you then need to tell them what shape noodle, what size/thickness, and how spicy.  The noodles have a bit of chew to them.  If you are not experienced with chop sticks, I suggest you go with a finer / smaller noodle.  The wide, fat noodles kept slipping out and splashing back into my broth.  No fork or metal spoon in sight, servers were all busy with other customers.  We wanted to check out the grocery store downstairs, but it closed while we were eating.  The servers never brought a check to the table - just pay on your way out (cash only I believe). The line to enter was even longer when we left.  Not sure when they cut off the line, as the posted closing time was approaching soon."

I am definitely book-marking this place for all of my future trips to Montreal going forward!I love that you can pick the thickness of your noodles, it really gives you the feeling of fresh made noodles. The soups were all very flavorful and the meat tasty."

Amazing!!!"

The medium is way more than I can eat so choose your portion wisely. I know many people get a small with extra meat. This place is small, crowded, and noisy with a typical 30 minute or longer wait. If you are impatient or struggle with people in your personal space this is not the place for you! If you can chill and just go with the flow you will be rewarded. Great tasting soup and very inexpensive. I've been several times and will continue to make this a Saturday afternoon destination."

""how huge could it be?"" HUGE!!! I was starving and I only ate half of my medium bowl. - Flavours on point. The broth is packed with flavour - Customizable noodles. They have multiple types of noodles, so you can choose shape and thickness - Noodle texture. Wonderful. - So many toppings. They are not cheap with the meat/veggies at all. So so so much! - Super cheap prices. Around 30$ after tax and tip for two. Cons: - 45min wait at 1pm on Saturday - Cramped places. We had to share a table with another group of two - Lemon water didn't taste like lemon. It just tasted like water, but there were little bits of stuff floating in it and at first I thought it was just dirty, but when I saw everyone had those, I understood that it's flavourless lemon bits. TL;DR: Super good prices, super good food, but too many people, so I'll have to time my visits better."

I was very much in love with their broth, to the point that I ate here twice in the 4 days that I stayed in Montreal. You can choose the thickness of your noodles and also opt for combos with your noodles. For the combo you get a tea egg and a choice of side for a few extra dollars. The beef is also fairly soft. Overall, the place is really affordable and tasty. My only complaint is that they do not have a bathroom."

The server asks you to pick your noodle size and spice level. We picked their regular sized noodles and chose for it to be spicy.

You pick your bowl sizes: Small, medium, or large bowl. FYI: The large bowl is MASSIVE!!! You can feed 2 grown men with the large. I ordered a medium and even with the medium, it was still huge.

The seating is not very comfortable. I always order a combo which include a noodle soup, a salad and a tea-infused egg.

/user_details?userid=oX8qsfKLmoDOnymwTfHiUw,Adrienna Y.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"The gigantic bowls of piping hot noodle soup served at Nouilles de Lan Zhou are phenomenal in the middle of winter. Each spoonful enveloped me in a warmth that was like sinking into a hot tub on a frigid day--soul-satisfyingly good.That they managed to impress my taste buds at the peak of summer speaks only further reiterates that this place has noodle soup down to a science.I am a flat wide noodles girl; I always have been and always will be, or so I thought. Then, I tried the san xi (size 3, round) noodles at Nouilles de Lan Zhou and everything I thought I loved about flat wide noodles changed. The reason flat, wide ones are great is that there is more surface area to the noodle which usually translates to better texture and more happiness. What I've since learned is that the da kuan (extra wide) noodles here are actually a little too flat for me. The chefs are just that good at rolling out the dough into sheets of noodles. As a result, when cooked, they get a smidge too soft and lose that prime QQ (Asian al dente) bite. On the other hand, san xi may be round-bodied, but  its thickness is optimal for QQiness!! The reason? What matters is not the amount of surface area, but really the thickest dimension of the noodle's cross section. The large bowls of Special Beef noodles here are laden with oodles of their optimally textured noodles and sold at a jaw-droppingly low price of $12. The rest of the magic lies in the light and clean broth, the thin cuts of beef with just the right amount of fat to keep them tender and the finishing touches of fresh cilantro and chili oil. They've also got more of their addicting chili oil at the table. This is the power of Nouilles de Lan Zhou--the ingredients are simple, but when packaged together, yield a bowl I could happily devour any day. Stop in the next chance you get. Your soul will thank you."

/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After months of searching, I finally got to try an authentic Noodle soup with a vegetarian broth thanks to Aruns review.I would always be so tempted by the delicious waft of a warming soup bowl from the various places downtown filling the air but whenever inquiring on whether their vegetarian soup bowl uses an actual vegetarian broth, I would get a negative answer. By chance, I happened to pass by Nouilles de Lan Zhou one bitter-cold Friday evening. It was absolutely freezing (-22) and despite not being hungry, we needed a place to quickly warm up so we could continue to our destination. Seeing the fresh noodles being hand made in front of my eyes through the restaurant window, I was pulled in and decided to order a small vegetarian noodle soup to try. It was my first time at such a place and I was not accustomed to the ordering system. Thankfully, the server was extremely friendly and guided me through the ordering process. He explained all the noodle types and thicknesses and confirmed that the broth was vegetarian. As we were eating in, he also brought us each a small cup of hot green tea.Within 5 minutes my order arrived and I was instantly taken aback by the portion size! The bowl was huge for a small-size and I wasn't even hungry! Still however, I managed to gobble it down and enjoyed it very much with the chilli oil. The flavours were very fresh and the noodles were perfect.The interior is very basic with cramped seating in a very small space. There is also an escalator leading down to a grocery store which I found very unusual and random. If it was closer, I would probably grab a takeaway as I wasn't too comfortable inside.

Noodles come in different sizes and shapes and are all hand made at the restaurant. We ordered the flat noodles and were not disappointed. I preferred the smaller size flat noodles as I found the largest too chewy. The broth is simple but still very flavourful. We also ordered a couple side dishes of spicy beef and some spicy cucumbers. Both were very tasty and had a very mild heat. Definitely don't order it if you have a peanut allergy though!

This places makes me feel at home. Authentic pulled noodle with a rich deep beef broth. I crave this all the time, it's especially delicious in the cold fall and winter. The major draw as you're walking passed is seeing the noodles getting pulled. You can choose the size and shape of your noodle, whatever suits your palette. I usually get the large round noodles. There are also combos that come with a small salad - spicy cucumber (super good and fresh), potato and seaweed (not as good as cucumber, but still nice) and there's a last one I can't recall. They also have cured beef plates, which remind me of home. If you run out of noodles, you can ask for more for a small price! There's usually a line so be prepared for that, but it's well worth the wait! Service is also pretty fast. I like to get a big bowl of noodles and bring it home for lunch over a few days.

But the flavors were lacking, and the noodle was a little overcooked. I've had plenty of better Lan Zhou noodles in Manhattan. I guess this is what lack of competition does to a market.

Ya, I can tell you that I can a giant vat of noodles in a soup with beef, that they were the longest hand-stretched noodles you can imagine, and that if you add the chili oil and other things you get this alchemy of salty, vinegary, spicy in your mouth. But you just can't encapsulate the magic of it unless you go.Starting from the outside, you know it's going to be good. There's a line out the door, and this is in the heat of the summer when you know that during soup season (the cold months) you're going to have a much longer line. Inside the seating is sparse and the chairs/tables tiny. And then there's the escalator. In the middle of this already tiny space is an escalator that comes up from the Asian market below. Like... this is an exit for the market. You sit there eating your food watching people come and go from the market, walking through the restaurant and out through the front doors. What wacky magic is this? Just know that if it is winter, the doors will always be open and it will, I imagine, never warm up inside.We were tearing through Chinatown and this was the last stop. One massive bowl to share between three of us. The large size was indeed hot tub sized and we all three shared the bowl and had leftovers (though we arrived somewhat full). The noodles don't come out easily and I was introduced to a method of cutting them by leaning in and gnawing off the middle, right at the bowl's rim. Judging by the looks we got from fellow diners, I'd say that is not a typical, accepted practice.It was really wonderful and one of the best memories of my recent trip. I was in such good company with colleagues and family, in a beautiful city, eating handmade food from passionate people, enjoying an experience and feelings of warm soupy happiness that I want to take with me wherever I go."

The soup was clear and simple, my tongue could not detect a distinct flavour but the chilli oil did add some taste. The highlights of the bowl was the noodles, radish slices and tender melt-in-your-mouth beef tendons. Service & atmosphere: Seating is slightly cramped but that just adds authenticity to the shop. The entrance of an underground asian market is housed inside the restaurant so after you are full from your noodles, you Jocan walk it off in the market.Price: I am sure you can get this bowl of noodles from China for a cheaper price.

/user_details?userid=Fje3gO0B3izgiptEaG4yCg,Nomiko B.,"Burnaby, Canada",4 star rating,I have been to this gem of a restaurant 4 times now. Last year I came to visit my sister in Montreal and she took me to this Chinese noodle soup restaurant. I fell in love with the quality of the food and its freshness.  The restaurant itself is not big by any means. It is located on the 2nd floor of a grocery store which makes the whole experience a bit more uncomfortable. The door to the restaurant is constantly being opened and closed due the fact that the store shares the same entryway with the restaurant...If you sit on one of the 3 seats right by the door your food will get cold before you finish it. The interior is nothing fancy (tables and seats is all you really get). The food however is what makes me happy. I waited a whole year for my 2018 trip to Montreal to eat this soup! Don't order the large size if you can't eat a lot at once. The portion size is HUGE!

The thick pork sauce had the right amount of ground pork and not making it a watery texture (everyone knows what I mean when restaurants put less pork and jack up the watery texture so it's more cost effective. All the peanuts and spices complemented the noodles and sauce and brought up the savory dish. Not too salty either which makes me want to eat it more.I usually never finish my food and give it to my bf to finish but it was amazing. We are here on Vacation and coming back tomorrow for another tasting during lunch. Restaurant has a small menu but only because they know what's best to serve and focus on their specialties to give you the best.  Beef noodle Soup was amazing too as we had a medium and medium size flat noodles (nice and chewy). Big chunks of tender meat and you are able to customize your Spiciness level. Don't be fooled their dishes are HUGE portions. So if you just want a snack, you're really getting a meal. Overall I love this place and suggest everyone come and try. Lines get long during peak meal hours but line moves fast."

Located above the entrance of an underground Chinese grocery store, this restaurant is a tiny tiny cramped space housing the best hand pulled noodles in the area. For those that don't know, the Chinese city of Lan Zhou is famous for their hand pulled noodles, as long as you step foot inside this restaurant you're doing something right. The setup and menu are extremely simple. The table setting is reminiscent of how noodle shops in China are like--with a bucket full of chopsticks and black vinegar for the noodles. The noodles had a perfect springiness to them and just FYI THE SMALL IS THE SIZE OF A NORMAL RAMEN BOWL. My dad unwittingly ordered the large and if I had a hamster, it could do some serious swim laps in that thing, no lie. The price is extremely cheap for what it is. DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. Be prepared for a line, we waited about 10-15 mins"

It is almost the perfect meal during my 3 days trip in Montreal overall, price and quality. The service is perfect. I ordered the basic small bowl noodle and it doesn't let me down. I can't imagine it is just 8 dollars, probably because it is in Chinatown and to make the price challenging. In the small bowl there are 6+ pieces meat which is great. The tea egg is a little bit cold but not matter much still delicious. The soup is excellent, which reminds me of my life in China. I definitely recommend you to have a choice. It is traditional and delicious treasury from China."
/user_details?userid=W_CkghBYSgJIJYi44GBTPA,HanDan W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My go-to place for a quick meal. The portion is generous that I can't finish the whole bowl sometimes. I usually order the medium size Lanzhou beef noodle with chili oil. It cost around 12$(taxes and tips included).The noodle is chewy and the soup base is delicious. The beef slices are also well marinated and it has the perfect proportion of tendon and meat.I also like their cold dishes. The edamame is my favorite and if I am hungry enough I would ask for an extra egg.  The location however is crowded and you may not have enough place to put down ur coat and bags. Highly recommend this place for anyone who want try the authentic Chinese noodles with a decent price.

This recent time was twice as long which means they are getting more and more popular. Love getting a free show of the noodle master in the window. They have 6 shapes and sizes from sliver thin to inch thick, best part is the noodles are made rolled and stretched on the spot. The broth, vegetarian and non are both delicious. Wish they had more tables and side dishes!The service is straight forward and pretty standard. Its rly warm in the restaurant. Each table has its own tray of chili oil, vinegar and sauces. Ive had their vegetarian noodles with thick and thin noodles, super flavorful and noodles are cooked perfectly.  Hubby got beef noodles...always thickest he can get lol Their seaweed salad and chili cucumber is fresh n delicious.

The noodles are fresh made right before your eyes, where the dough is pulled to the right size depending on the order. The noodle texture is perfect, fresh and chewy with the right kind of bounce. Both the classic soup noddles and the zhajiang noodles were delicioussss. Their egg is great too so if your order doesn't come with one, might as well get one for extra. The food is a great deal! They give you large portions, even if you choose a small bowl size. I like to take the rest home cause the leftovers make another meal TBH. Theres also some combos that include a side and egg as well. Also, ask for their free tea! It's really mild with Chinese dates and flowers. The restaurant is small, so expect a lineup. Worth it though!"

Small place so come right when they open or be prepared to line up for  a while. The waiters have eagle eyes and will snatch away your bowl after the last bite. No lingering allowed.

We also got the thickest circular noodle, but that was a bit on the chewier side for my tastes.We got the special beef (not the beef noodle soup served seasonally), Dan Dan, and veggie flavors. Highly recommend the first two, the veggie not so much. It had a strange coconut flavor to it, and while I do like coconut, I wasn't feeling it in this soup.As long as you don't get the veggie, the food is great and the service is fast. I can't imagine what the wait would be during normal hours though. Also, the portion sizes are huge. The small was more than enough for just me.

Considering the cold weather that has just set upon us, nothing better than a good soup to warm our hearts. Went there on a cold Saturday for dinner with friends. I arrived a little after my friends were already. When arrive, there was a line already. To consider, this restaurant has very limited seating spots as it is located right above a grocery store. Lines are to be expected at any time of the day due to that. The menu itself offers very small variety, which can be good or bad. In this case, it is definitely a good thing since they have perfected their menu to those limited items. You can also decide which kinds of noodles (size and shape) you want. Worth mentioning is their weekend special which my friends praise a lot. Unfortunately, as a non-spicy eater, I was not able to taste it. I have opted for the original noodle bowl. It came to 12$ for a large bowl, before taxes. By large, I mean LARGE. There were so many noodles! I was barely able to finish it even coming in hungry. The flavors were not varied but well done. Overall, very good value for quality and quantity. Would recommend in a heartbeat, especially during cold weather like the ones we have in Montreal."

Always a good way to find a good grub spot when visiting a city for the first time. The broth was full of flavor, the noodles were cooked perfectly and we sat with a mother and daughter (since it's a tiny place, the waiter asked if we didn't mind sitting with another group and we said sure thing).

The noodles with the soup though? Not sure. The vegetarian soup was honestly alright. It had this interesting coconuty taste and I literally had to dump half of the bowl of chilli to make it spicy.

Upon ordering, I was a bit disappointed because they were out of tea. The food, however, made up for it.The ""salad"": the cucumber salad had a perfectly balanced, crunchy peanut/Sichuan peppercorn topping. Definitely worth ordering if you choose to get the ""combo""The noodles: The broth for the vegetarian noodles was better and richer than any vegetarian broth I've had at similar restaurants, and the noodles were just as fresh and springy as I had expected. The egg, on the other hand (which I had been excited for, given some of the reviews I had read), didn't have enough of a ""tea"" taste to it but it was okay, because I don't think I'd want that tea taste in my soup. In the future, I'd be interested to see if they could offer a vegetarian version of the beef noodle soup, because I feel like that would be amazinggg.All in all, long lines but quick service, huge portions, tasty food, and at a good price."

Nothing like I ever tasted in my whole life.Dan Dan noodle was nicely seasoned, excellent balance of meat quantity and cilantro. The meat sticks as you mix the ingredients together. Simply 10 out of 10.Soup was tasty, rightly seasoned, perfectly spicy... and doesn't leave tingly feeling at the end like other msg enduced instant noodle.

From there, you'll be asked about the size of noodle and if you want the noodle round or rectangle and the spice level. I got the size medium (for $9.99) with an XL size round noodle and it was HUGE.

It certainly attracts tourists but the place is good to frequent even for locals.We got the cucumber salad for appetizer. I really like the peanut crumbles sprinkled on top. The cucumber tasted refreshing and spicy, it reminded me of cucumber kimchi. They use a lot of the Szechuan peppers so it's a bit numbing.We ordered the noodles with braised beef tendon and Zhajiang. I especially liked the Zhajiang, which was cold noodles. I really liked the black bean sauce and the tea egg was as good as usual. I think I would've wanted more of the sauce compared to the noodle portion they gave us.The braised beef tendon was super tender and soup was heart-warming. It's cool that you can choose the size of your noodles here, from round thin noodles to thick flat noodles. I always go with the thinnest round ones, I found they have the best chewy texture.Everything was not suuuper amazing but definitely above average and I'd come back again."

I was expecting more since reading all the great reviews on this place. We ordered a small bowl of the Lang Zhou beef noodles (medium) and a medium bowl of the beef tendon with large noodles. We also split the cucumber salad which was really delicious. I was expecting more kick but got a timid visit to my taste buds. I had to add quite a lot of the chilli sauce to my soup. It was good nonetheless. One thing. Both bowls had the same size noodles. I don't know if we got the medium or the large lol! Portions are HUGE! We could easily split a medium bowl for the three of us. Cheap fare for good eats. Not the best but still satisfying!
/user_details?userid=ITSnuLOu81doC5GGT5NMSQ,Randy T.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #1] Delicious, freshly made Chinese noodles in the heart of Montreal Chinatown.  This restaurant is hard to miss - just look for the restaurant with a chef making noodles in the window.  You can stand outside in awe and watch as the noodles are prepared.  Or, the better thing to do would be to go inside and actually try them.  Notable entrees include beef noodle soup and zhajiangmian.Highlights: The noodles are excellent.  They're soft with good texture.  I ordered the zhajiangmian, which is a large bowl of noodles with pork in a ground bean sauce topped with a layer of vegetables.  You get plenty of food in your order - in addition to your noodle bowl, you'll get a large cup of broth on the side.  The vegetables were very fresh and there was a lot of variety.  I noticed a pleasant herbal taste to the broth - definitely was a good thing to have on the side.  My photo shows a lot of vegetables, but they're not cheap with either the meat or the noodles underneath.Critiques: Cash and debit only, but this is typical practice for a lot of the best Chinese restaurants.  Luckily, I had exchanged a few USD for some CAD at the overpriced exchange kiosk at the airport. With respect to the dish, the pork was saltier than what I'm accustomed to for this dish.  If the dish were less salty, I'd be giving this five stars.Overall: Excellent quantity and top notch noodles are served at Nouilles de Lan Zhou.  I'd go back to try the same noodles with other toppings (for example, a beef tendon noodle dish that is only served on the weekends)."

There's almost always a line during meal times unless you get lucky, but service is fast, friendly, and endearing. There aren't that many tables since the restaurant is located above a supermarket, but the noodles come in 5-10 minutes, so the turnover time is pretty fast.The portions are huge, and the prices are super reasonable. Honestly, I love everything about their noodles. I've tried most things on the menu, but my personal favourite is the zha jiang mian, which comes with a small soup on the side. For me, half a medium-sized portion is already super filling. My tip: always order the tea egg (or two) for $0.99 each."

The restaurant is pretty small with about 10 tables and a long table against the wall w/ stools and a few seats in front of their kitchen.  The restroom is on the 5th floor of the building that you have to access w/ a service elevator.We ordered:Julienned squash & seaweed salad - refreshingly perfect! The sweet, salty, and acidity levels were all in perfect harmony.Cucumber appetizer - the cucumbers were coated in a creamy, porky, and spicy sauce. It had a nice amount of heat and very tasty.Cold beef w/ chili oil - served w/ scallions, 1 broccoli and 1 cauliflower, and sate chili oil. The chili oil was packed w/ flavor and had a slight delicious garlic flavor.  This definitely elevated the dish.  This beef is the same beef they use in the noodle soup dish.Beef noodle soup (Large) - WOW, this bowl was HUGE! Luckily hubby and I shared this bowl.  The noodles, meat, broth, and chili were all PERFECTION. We added an egg to this dish for an extra $1. The egg was full of flavor and hubby enjoyed it very much.  There was also daikon in the bowl, but I didn't eat it.  Wish it came with some greens, but that's okay b/c we had 2 veggie sides to eat along with the noodle soup.  Our lunch was so good that we came back and ordered the zhajiang mian and the julienned squash & seaweed salad togo for dinner. Zhajiang mian - huge portion served w/ broth on the side.  The pork and fermented black bean sauce was delicious.  This bowl had julienned carrots, bok choy, edamame, and pieces of pickled mustard greens.  It was definitely tricky tossing the noodles when we got back to our hotel b/c the noodles had congealed together.  A few minutes in the microwave loosened up the noodles which solved the issue.Overall, we would definitely return to this restaurant if we visit Montreal again.  Delicious food, fast service, and very affordable/cheap prices!"

I don't think they add any MSG since I left the restaurant stuffed and thankfully not dehydrated. Make sure to eat the thicker noodles quick because they will get soggy if you don't slurp em up fast enough. I got the small combo which comes with a small side dish. I tried the pickled edamame which was a little too street market tasting for me and the cucumbers which were pretty spicy! The pickled edamame went perfect with the soup, however, so I highly recommend dumping some in your noodle soup for added flavor.If you're wondering how big of a bowl you should order... definitely no larger than a medium unless you are STARVING."

While awaiting, diners can enjoy the art of noodle hand pulling that dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years, the chefs cook the noodles right in front of diners & mere spectators, so get your iPhone & S8+ ready to blog about the experience.And if you're lucky enough to get a table, table sharing may be necessary if alone, the noodles cone in a HUMONGOUS size of soup bowl, the appearance looks enticing.

The noodle soup with beef tendons looked delicious, but the broth lacked the punch, especially considering the craze it has drawn.

Nouilles de Lan Zhou has always been my go-to place whenever our friend group wants to get something cheap and quick to eat in a lively social setting. The restaurant is cleaner and more attractive in terms of design than your typical Chinese restaurant, so I guess that's a plus for people who think that matters.I always get the medium spicy Lanzhou beef noodle bowl with a tea egg. Medium-sized bowls here are more or less like a large anywhere else, and they only cost $12-$13 including tax depending on if you get an egg or not. While the broth is by no means spicy (which is disappointing considering normally one or two small spoonfuls should do the trick), it still has a nice flavor to it that is aided by hints of cilantro and radish. The noodles are perfectly bouncy and seem endless, which are perfect since I love slurping up noodles! The beef, however, seemed to have gone down in quality since I was last here, since I felt like it consisted of more cartilage than usual instead of actual meat.Especially in comparison to other Chinese restaurants, this place is definitely one of the better options.

There's no place to put your winter coat or bag so you sorta stay fully dressed but it's fine cause it's so good you don't talk, you just eat fast. They serve you up this horrible tea (to be fair, I'm not a tea person, I usually only get chamomile). The tea, 'cleanses the palate' by erasing all memories of good tasting food, and starts you off low so the soup tastes like the best thing you've ever had.I ordered the dan dan bowl with the fattest noodles BOTH TIMES (you can choose the noodle size). The noodles were doughy and perfect. Then, when they bring it out, it comes in this bowl larger than your head, slippery plastic chop sticks and a small ladle to eat/drink/slurp it with. It's nearly impossible to pick up the noodles and then keep them on the chopsticks long enough to funnel them into your mouth - a humbling challenge to say the least.Oh but the food is so good it's worth the abuse of the crammed seating, cold winter air coming in every time the door opens, and inadequate eating utensils. Highly recommend."

I had the three xi noodles and they were delicious! My friend had the 炸酱面 (zajiangmian) and it was excellent too. I'll have that next time because having soup noodles was a workout and a half.

The broth is nice and flavourful, not quite as good as the real thing but close enough. The only thing that I find lacking is the spicy oil, back n Lanzhou, the bowl is covered with half a cm thick of spicy oil while here I had to nearly empty the pot on the table to achieve a something close.

Their signature is the Lan Zhou beef noodle soup. You get to choose the thickness and shape of the noodle that are made fresh to order right at the glass window. Their kitchen is completely open--so you know you're getting quality. As I sat there waiting for my food, I could hear them calling out the orders and noodle styles for the chef to hand pull them to order. I like to get wide noodles because they have more chew and indeed they were very chewy and perfectly cooked. The prices are very reasonable and I could barely finish a small bowl so definitely go a size down if you're unsure what size to get!

This is a tiny space seating no more than 20 people at most and gets very crowded quickly but the line seems to move fairly well.

Tasting is believing, and I honestly don't think this place deserves any more than 2 stars. Reasons:1) The place is located in a corner section above a supermarket. Seating is extremely limited, like less than 40, and if you have a party of less than 4, you're likely to be seated with strangers in the same table. The wait can be atrocious. 2) The noodle: while it was made in front of me, I found it to be undercooked and not the true Lanzhou ""chewy"". It's OK, but seriously you can get better noodles in the supermarket below. 3) The soup stock: tasteless and salty, like someone took tap water, added beef stock and salt, and called it a day. 4) The beef: it was...okay. The Lanzhou beef noodle place in Philly is way better, but driving 7 hours south is probably not in most people's interest for Lanzhou beef noodles."
/user_details?userid=SjgDlQXD4611svaP7fYrQA,Ann N.,"Galveston, TX",5 star rating,"YUM!!! FIVE STARS. We came here mid-afternoon, around 2:00 PM on a Tuesday after a horrible dining experience our first night in Chinatown Montreal the evening before. This place is comfy, hip -- wooden tables and chairs. A bit smaller for a noodle joint, but still very homey and ""cozy"", especially when it's 20 degrees F outside. There's a window in front of the restaurant where you can see the noodles being handmade from scratch from the outside. They make fresh noodles for each bowl ordered. It was very interesting to see how the dough was rolled, cut, simmered in broth -- all by hand. Note that there is a big stairwell to an underground supermarket in the middle of the store. Although some may say it takes away from the ambience, it didn't bother us too much! The service - pretty above average. We were seated quickly, given hot tea and a pitcher of lemon water, and had our order taken right when we came in. Noted that it was a slow mid-week afternoon, so perhaps Friday and weekend nights are a bit more difficult to be seated in such a timely manner. Our order came out in about 15 minutes.The food - EXCELLENT. There's only 3 options of which soup to order on their menu: a vegetarian option, a pork soup, and a beef soup. I ordered the beef soup -- their most popular one. They had 3 sizes: Small ($7.99), Medium ($9.99), and Large ($11.99). I ordered a Medium. They also give you the option of spicy or non-spicy. I had spicy.The portions are HUGE. My medium bowl came out to be about 11""-12"" in diameter. Lots and lots of noodles, broth was seasoned with spices and pepper, a handful of beef, steaming hot. The spoon they also give you is also very interesting (think stew soup instead of typical Asian soup spoon), and it was a GREAT meal. I was full afterward, and for the affordable price for such a large serving size -- I will definitely come here again and again next time in Montreal. Final notes - The broth was flavorful, the noodles were very fresh, and the beef was great. I was extremely impressed by the efficiency of the service and, of course, the portions for the price. Five stars for a great, simple, and authentic dining experience. Helpful tips - if you have a large appetite for meat, they offer ""extra"" beef (or any meat that comes with the soup you order) and ""extra"" noodles for an additional $2-3. My normal Medium bowl was more than enough for me, so it wasn't an issue at all! Furthermore, the ""spicy"" option is not too hot, for those who prefer a ""no sweat"" spice kick.If you come to Chinatown Montreal, I really recommend dropping by this place by all means. I wish they would open one of these in the States, as I can see myself grabbing a handful of friends every weekend for lunch AND dinner. Hot, fast, and fresh. 5/5!!!"

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lan Zhou-style noodles are famous in China, and you can find shops all accross the country selling this simple meal. It's usually a small joint with tiny tables and even tinier chairs. There's rarely air conditioning, and a fan is typically blowing from a corner of the dining room. Noodles MUST be fresh and handmade, if not by the owners of the restaurant, then by a noodle factory. The ""mouthfeel"" of the noodles is very important - something not unrelated from the term ""al dente"" in Italian cuisine. The rest of the dish tend to vary (broth, toppings, seasoning). Nouilles de Lan Zhou used to only serve beef noodles, in three different bowl size, and different types of noodles (round or flat). They have since expanded their menu (e.g. cold noodles, beef tendon noodles) and added a few side dishes (e.g. edamame and pickled mustard green, spicy cucumbers). The regular beef noodles remain my favorite.The restaurant is located in a weirdly arranged space at the entrace of the G&D supermarket, and has probably less than 30 seats. Service is fast, and the illustrated menu is helpful to make a choice. It usually goes like this: 1) choice of noodles, and if required, 2) bowl size, 3) type of noodle, and 4) spicy or not. Some noodles, such as the beef tendon noodle, only has one size (medium). Talking about size, the portions are humooongous. I don't recommend ordering anything larger than medium if you can't finish, e.g. three Big Macs. A great place to grab a cheap and quick meal!"

/user_details?userid=CwUvSaeItqpFCDh0jHaNuQ,Lily Y.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Food: Probably one of the bests of it's kind in MTL in terms of hand-pulled noodles Lanzhou style. The broth is tasty but not too salty, and actually quite clear unlike some other places where it seems to be tainted by soy sauce. The meat is tender and no big pieces of FAT (yes that's a no-no). The noodles come in different sizes, made to order, cooked just right~ the most popular being erxi but i love mine flat, ye jiuye! Erxi tends to be more chewy and jiuye is softer, and due to the flat shape, coats in spicy sauce better :)Service: Fast, efficient, nicePrice: redefining worth the price for the amount of noodle~Ambiance: why the minus one star. Located above the busy Chinese supermarket, squeezed in a bathroom sized space, where u literally sit back to back with the person behind you, no place to put ur belongings beware! really, eat everything and leave, u don't want to linger here~"

I love fresh handmade noodles, especially when you can see how the chef make it. Amazing! I was a little surprised when the first time I had it here since there was so much beef which was kind of pressure  for me to eat it up though it's not greasy at all, but too much, I like its soup also which makes me have quite good appetite. This place is a little crowded so avoid to come at rush hours if you don't want to wait in a line. Besides, I love the decoration of this place, wooden chair wooden table, the containers for the chopsticks and sauces, and the lamps, very classic Chinese."

I got a small bowl, which was plenty filling with its generous portions. While b.'s Vegetable Noodle Soup was decent, the odd topping of seaweed salad in the soup turned the broth an unappetizing green color halfway through.$6.99 for a small, $8.99 for a medium, and $10.99 for a large.Seating is crowded so you may end up sharing a table with strangers. There was no A/C when we went and it was a fairly warm day so you may end up sharing a table with sweaty strangers. b. noted that the bowls may or may not be entirely sanitized as the woman seemed to be only rinsing them off with pressurized (hopefully hot) water, so don't go licking them clean.

But the tenderness of the soup, and the essence of noodles are both missing at this place.location: in chinatown, adjacent to a market, this place is always compared with the other place, which sserves the same kind of noodles. the seats are fairly limited, that is to say that you have to wait in line until someone finished their food and then you can grab your seats and eat.Food: they have three sizes of noodles. Small, medium and large. And you can choose the size of the noodles, and the thickness. In addition, you can choose how spicy you want the soup to be. I had medium, size 2 and less spicy for lunch. The portion is huge. I barely could finish it but I saw many men were eating large size. My ""OMG"" face is clearly showing towards them. I found the soup bit salty and I wished that I could add more spice into my soup to alleviate some saltiness. The noodle is less tendered and made me even miss more about China. I wanted to eat the real, autentihc one.Price: small for 7? Medium for 10. Very pricy with regard to their qualities and limited other choices for lunch, and service quality. Overall: although I probably won't be back in a while, I still do not recommend to come to this place. Why? It's just not worth to spend 10 dollars to eat something that is not that delicious.

I recommend getting the medium for $12.97 CAD (before tax) and going with the spicy cucumber salad-the noodles are fresh (high volumes at this restaurant) and beef is tender. The broth is flavorful. I usually skip drinking the broth (too much sodium) but couldn't help myself from taking a few sips. The waiter does ask you how spicy you want your noodles so don't be shy if you can't handle spicy-the spicy cucumber salad is okay but I think it is superior vs the other 2 choices-I wish they would give you the tea egg separately vs dropping it in the broth-the restaurant provides free tea or water-oddly shaped restaurant, L-shaped because it is basically on top of the large supermarket which is downstairsWould definitely come back and deserves to be in my Montreal Chinatown rotation"

We came here because of the crowds and long waiting line while visiting Old Montreal. We thought it must be good. No surprise it was very good. The restaurant is very small and table sitting is very limited. Sometimes you might have to share table with others. So if you don't like the cramped sitting and space, you will not like here. Now for the food, the beef noodle soup was excellent. Not only it tasted great, it was huge in portion. You need a big appetite to finish it."

/user_details?userid=flLRXOp1P7ZDgyP2299Dww,J T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Huge huge huge portions. Seriously, get the small if you have a size choice unless you want leftovers for the next day. I had the beef tendon noodle soup, which only comes in medium and certainly served as my lunch and dinner that day. The tendon was cooked well and not too chewy. The broth was flavourful and reminded me of the dark Taiwanese beef noodle soup broth. The noodles were perfectly al dente and chewy, as advertised by the guy kneading away by the window. My boyfriend got the dandan noodles. While this dish was very delicious, it's also extremely oily! Beware, if you have a sensitive stomach. In addition, they use copious amounts of peppercorn so be prepared for that numbing-spicy feeling in your mouth. All in all, a pleasant, efficient meal for a great price. Also, don't expect a Micheline 3-star restaurant service; Asian countries have a different mentality towards service. You come to a place like this for the food, not the service -- keep that in mind when you see the poorer reviews!"

The soup is extremely flavorful and if you like spicy food they have a type of chili oil you can add to it which gives it a wonderful spice. The noodles are handmade and the price is right. Definitely a great pick if ever you're in the Chinatown area and are craving a good soup. The small is a perfect size, and the medium is good if you have a bigger appetite or are starving.

I have heard of it as the noodle place with the supermarket downstairs but you should all remember that it's called LAN ZHOU. They have delicious asian noodles with an assortment of different noodle thickness and shape of the noodle. I would go for the small if you're not too hungry. If you're starving you should get the medium. Their sizes are humongous and remember that it's noodles in soup as well and soup really fills you up! Their spicy is a little bit too spicy for my liking but these noodles will turn your sad day upside down. You can also watch the employees make noodle by the window at the front or inside. It's pretty mesmerizing watching them make the noodles. Don't come in a group of more than 4 since there isn't that much seating.

Broth was pretty weak by Chinese standards, which I felt condemned the dish for me.

They let us browse the menus but they did not take our orders until right after 11 am. A very good blend of tea was also served then as well.Overall, I must say the broth and the noodles were excellent. Very natural beef broth tasting without a lot of salt. Even the side dishes were not bad at all. We tried the house beef noodle in the ""third thin"" size and the dry pork noodles. They let you choose and specify the hand-pulled noodle size from the super thin to super fat depending on your own noodle texture preference. You can even choose the spicy level too.Even a medium is quite large. Make sure you get their combo to get a side dish, a tea egg, and a beef noodle in a cheaper combo price vs a la carte pricing. Pork noddle unfortunately only comes in one huge size! We had to pack half of it in the end. Will come back again for sure!"

If you're going to get the traditional soup, it basically just choosing your thickness of noodle and then whether you want spicy or not!I don't think that getting a large is worth the extra two dollars... I think I definitely would have been satisfied with the medium. I didn't have the thinnest noodle option, but my friend did and those were my favorite.

They also offer a customer's choice for noodle type/thickness.  My personal favorite is the ultra-thin noodle, because they're soft and absorb the soup so well.  Though you can also go for big inches-wide chewy flat noodle and anything in between.  The portion is larger than you'd normally see in Montreal.  Their small is most people's normal size, so get small for solo, or get a medium/large to share.  If you always complain that other places don't give enough, you're going to leave happy from here.  It's worth the wait if the line doesn't go beyond the entrance.  Price, quality, quantity are all on-point.Is it as good as eating it in Lan Zho, China?  No.  But this is plenty good enough to have a taste in Montreal."

Lan Zhou has the most incredible hand pulled noodles which are slightly chewy and oh so fresh. Their vegetable noodle soup comes in a different broth that they make and tastes incredible. I asked the waiter what the broth is made of and he said it's a secret recipe - how alluring.

You could order three different sizes depending on the size of your appetite.  I ordered a medium.  It was so good that I almost ate it all, yet I was amazed that I didn't have that greasy, salty stuffed-up feeling in my stomach that I sometimes get at certain Chinese food restaurants.  If you drink your broth, you might be okay with the small.  I'm on a low-sodium diet so I tend to avoid drinking the broth.  Also, a side note--someone ordered the vegetarian noodles and was surprised that the broth was a curry based one.  She loved it, though and said it was one of the best broths that she's had.  I'm not sure if she just didn't read the menu well or if it wasn't specifically noted.  Anyway, the place was packed (try not to take your shopping bags with you because things are cramped here) so I am not the only one thinking that this place is awesome.  I will definitely return to Nouilles de Lan Zhou (so good that I have the name memorized) when visiting Montreal again.  No credit cards.  Prices were reasonable. I think it was cash only."

I like that I was able choose how thick I wanted my noodles, and the service was very quick. It's in a bit of an odd location, since there's an escalator smack dab in the middle of the restaurant that leads to the grocery store downstairs. So you'll see a lot of people coming and going from there. Seating is quite limited, but it wasn't very busy when I was there, so it wasn't a problem. There's a clear view of the kitchen, which looked very clean, and you can watch them while they hand pull the noodles. The prices are good for the amount of food you get, and since it's so quick, it would make a good place for a lunch break."

I went alone too and I absolutely hate not finishing my food, so I forcefully finished it and this is probably why I didnt fully enjoy my experience.The taste of the broth was really rich, the meat was meat with tendon rather than being tendons (which is what I was hoping for). It's also quite on the more greasy side for Chinese Lanzhou Lamian, but overall OK. Just make sure you have a super huge appetite/bring a friend.

I don't speak French, but I wish the waiter had told us that you could change the thickness of the noodles and even order flat ones.

So here goes my first review.This is an awesome Chinese place in the Chinatown district in Montreal.  It may seem like a tourist trap that the place has a guy who hand rolls noodles in the front window, but the food (and the guy) is for real.I went there for lunch with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day (I know, I'm a true romantic). It was freezing outside but the place was still pretty full.  There aren't a lot of seats inside, but diners turn over quick, so getting a spot was not hard.  When I sat down, the servers immediately brought a super hot yet very welcome tea.  I ordered a medium spicy beef tendon noodle, and it was delicious.  The broth was rich and flavorful, and though the beef at times was a little gamey (it's beef tendon, so this should be expected), the rich flavor more than offset the chewy texture. And oh yes, the noodles were fantastic.  The portions are huge, and I couldn't finish off the entire bowl.  Unless you are really really hungry, a small bowl should meet most appetites just fine.  But if it's any consolation, the medium bowl only cost $10 USD.Next time I find myself in Montreal on a cold day, I'm coming to this place."

The food is just alright, the broth isn't too oily or watery but it doesn't have a lot of taste either. Similarly, the noodles are thicker than need be and don't have a particularly satisfying texture I often find in dishes with thick noodles (I.e. Hokkien mee). The price doesn't reflect what you can really get around this area, and the eating space is small and cramped, which seems cute and makes it seem busy and bustling until you're there on a rainy or snowy day and you're moving aside constantly to make space for people in wet coats passing you by all the time.

Which is why I gave this place a 4 star, because the noodle soup was imo amazing, the portion was big despite the fact that I ordered a small. The service is extremely fast, you'll get your food in no time. But the place is tiny and it reflects on the service a lot, it doesn't bother me but I imagine it could bother some people and is important to anyone who plans on coming here. This really isn't a regular restaurant, it's food first, everything else second. It's more like a food stall with seats; you eat, you pay, you leave. I think there's like 2 tables that seats 4 people, sometimes you end up being seated right next to strangers. So if you're expecting a nice comfortable restaurant, you're looking at the wrong place. They do have a take out option.I also noticed most of the people that were eating there would leave as soon as they were done, so this kind of ""restaurant"" is normal to the regulars."

We had the za jian mien and beef noodle soup and believe me when I say unless you have a huge appetite, one bowl was enough for two ppl! The hand pulled noodles had good nite to it and the sauce was delish. The appetizers were also very good, had the pickled cucumber and the sliced beef not too spicy either. The place is super small and gets packed quick, you most likely will be rubbing elbows with strangers, but the food is good and the service friendly !"

A very limited menu with some of the best flavored and textured hand pulled noodles. When you taste the quality of the seasoning, the freshness of the broth and the insane taste and chewiness of the noodles you understand why they only need like 10 items on the menu to be this amazing. Do not miss the spicy cold cucumber (staple Schezuan dish) and the wonderfully seasoned Edamame with ginger chillies, both a delicious accompaniment."

/user_details?userid=VnMNQPaMSYkUyiFCAEonPw,Yan L.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Their beef noodles are amazing!! Really great texture; you can just feel the hand-made dedication with each bite. The soup may look bland, but it's actually very flavorful, thanks to the Chinese parsley, spring onions, daicon and chili oil. I asked for medium spicy, and it was just right, though beads of sweat were literally forming on my face as I slurped each bite -- but I didn't care, because it was sooo delicious! The beef comprised decent cuts of brisket, though nothing fancy. Portion sizes are very generous. I initially wanted to order a medium bowl of noodles as a set (which comes with an egg and a side dish of veggies), but the waiter told me that the medium bowl itself was enough to get me full, so I just went with noodles only. I'm not sure how anyone can physically manage to finish the large size."

The medium size is huge, be aware! The device is nice only in English tho. I went during a cold night and I had to eat with my winter jacket on. The weird set up, some electric stairs going down to the grocery in the basement right in the middle of the place, makes it almost windy inside every time someone gets in or out.

/user_details?userid=j78OeM6cLZ3OsFlJwwOgpA,Michelle P.,"Orange, CA",2 star rating,"Ok, I don't know why everyone is so positive about this place. As other reviewers have stated the go to dish here is the Lan Zhou Noodles. There are a variety of sizes to the noodles and they are hand made. I opted for the third thinnest variety as I'm not a big fan of huge knife cut noodles. The noodles came out ok looks wise to my liking, but I was not impressed with the flavor at all. I felt like the noodles were the type that could grow exponentially in hot soup and I felt that they did grow a bit as I ate on. The soup itself was a clearer beef broth which is different from what I was used to. There is an essence of the bone there, but it's not really flavorful at all - pretty watered down in my opinion. As for the beef - it's a couple of thin slivers with no pieces of shank or stew to be substantial. I got the combo that came with the third veggie option which turned out to be a cold seaweed salad which was overly salty. I would say don't believe the hype and skip this place. It's not worth the calories."

I also got a side salad of spicy cucumbers that had some sort of peanut butter sauce (which in my option was not THAT spicy, maybe a tad lower than sriracha directly on your tongue).

This is definitely not the real deal, but the lack of authenticity aside (I don't judge food by its authenticity; I grew up with and love General Tao and Butter Chicken).The noodles are not very good. They are hand-made for sure, but so are the noodles from Nudo 2 minutes away, Yuki Lamen (sp?) at Concordia's Faubourg and that one Lamen shop at Eaton Center's food court, and frankly, it's not very good or fresh here.The seating is atrocious here. It's very cramped, since it's a semi-open area to the outside, flies is a problem in summer and the extreme coldness is a problem in winter. Plus the floor  are just disgusting. The tables aren't very clean either, you'll most likely get your winter jacket and/or shirt dirtied.The soup stock is itself is very watered down and tasted mainly... I dunno how to describe the flavor that only chemically constituted beef bouillon cube can provide. You might make better beef stock with half chemical flavoring and half real meat and/or bone at home.TL;DR:Meh noodle, bad soup, extremely back setting. Good proximity to the metro, much better options, including other Lan Zhou style Lamen, to be had within 3 minutes walking distance."

It is only a short walk from old Montreal and located on the Main Street of Montreal Chinatown. The service is relatively good, but the food is just ok. There is really nothing so memorable. The noodles are truly hand pulled, with the noodle maker making noodles in the front window. The soup itself is ok but nothing so great. As a comparison, the Vietnamese pho shops generally have better quality broths and tastier noodle soups. The prices are around CAD$10 for a large bowl.

You get options from thin, medium, or thick for round or flat. I love handpulled flat noodles and this is the only place that does them well. Don't get the thick flat noodles though. They end up being ridiculously large and impossible to eat. The broth is always hot and flavourful, full of herbs and seasonings (but the light kind of beef broth, not the heavy dark kind) and the beef is yummy and well-marinated. The small is a slightly large portion of food for the average person. The medium is a very large portion of food that will be more than enough for almost everyone. The large is a bowl as larger as most salad mixing bowls and essentially comes with a little shovel instead of a spoon. If you're not a person who finishes the soup its more manageable, but still. Always add the tea egg, no question. The appetizer/side dishes are good but not worth it cost wise, plus you won't need the additional food. I always end up spending around $10 here. Don't bother coming if you're vegetarian. The vegetables they use are frozen and of poor quality and the broth is not comparable to the regular."

/user_details?userid=U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I just revised this review since I went back and found out that the name given is Yuki Ramen, though the Chinese name is Lan Zhou La Mien.  This is the second restaurant in Montreal that has a Japanese based name as it's Westernized name, that doesn't really correspond with the Chinese name at all.  The other is Kanbai on Ste. Catherine.  The rest of the review is the same.  Very inexpensive but very good HANDMADE NOODLES.  There are offered without soup mixed with some sort of sauce.  We had: 1.  RED COOKED BEEF SHANK:  This is a very traditional dish made with different spices, soy sauce, and a pork/chicken broth that is suite and rich.  Their name was anglicized and frankified, so I don't remember what they called it.  The broth was great. The meet was not cooked as long as it should, so it didn't have the tenderness that this dish normally has.  But it was tasty and the fresh pulled hand made noodles were delightful. 2.  PORK WITH PICKLED VEGETABLES: T his is a traditional chinese dish too.  The broth is oilier, but delightful and the flavors were rich and good.  A little bit of spiciness, but not much.  3.  WONTON NOODLES:  The kids had this.  The broth was more delicate and good. 4.  SPICY COLD PIG EARS:  I know.  Sounds gross.  Eh?  Delicious.  Spicy in the Schichuan style with hot and tingly or ""mala"" spicing.  NEXT TIME:  Want to dry the noodles with beef-dza jia mien.  My wife makes this and it's wonderful.  Want to try it.  BADS:  Waitress was kind of disintrested.  No decor at all.  INFORMATION:  1.  I don't know the English name of this restaurant.2.  I don't know the exact address, but it's near Epicerie Lam Kee just to the sounth. 3.  Lan zhou noodles are normally made with a kind of naturally occuring chemical used in Japanese and Chinese noodles sometimes called ""kansui"".  I don't know if they used it here, since it usually imparts a yellowish color to the noodle, and these were very white.  4.  In New York, I would give this a slightly lower rating.  This was a joint rating by me and my Chinese wife.  We thought about 1/2 to 1 star lower for Manhattan."

/user_details?userid=CV8OtcJjplPY18KEG8f_gQ,Henry R.,"Richmond, VA",5 star rating,"Expectations? Fresh, quick and tasty. Non-expectations? Variety, room to stretch, exchanging patter with the staff. Oh, and at a very very reasonable price.  This Chinese beef noodle shop is everything one can reasonably want. The noodles are stretched and slapped and twirled and twisted in the front window. Based on the orders, the noodle-maker prepares different sizes, plops a portion into a vat of boiling water. A few minutes later, another person scoops up the noodles, drains them and puts them in a bowl, to which a ladle or two of simmering  clear beed broth is added. At the next station is the daikon, cilantro, chili oil (if so requested), beef slices, tea egg (if requested). There are three sizes and the medium is enough for a football player. There are a few other items like spicy cucumber and edamame. We had two small beef noodle soups, with moxi and Jo Yen style noodles. There are few seats, maybe ten tables and another ten at the counters, so we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Service was fast, price was great! If you are looking for cantonese or Szechuan or Thai or a Chinese banquet, there are a dozen other places within blocks. This place is for beef noodles."
