Their menu has so many items that anyone can find at least one item that they would love.The seafood platter don't always have the same sashimis. You would have to ask the staff what is on their menu for the week. Trust me, this is probably one of the best seafood platters that you can find in the city at their prices! The small and large platter are placed beautifully with fresh seafood. Their skewers are lightly charcoaled and very well seasoned. The price point for the skewers are extremely affordable. The chicken thigh skewers are tender and has a nice char on the outside. The takoyaki has the perfect consistency.The cream udon with ribs... ohhh mmmmmm geeeee it is such an amazing comfort food. The udon is soaked in a creamy cheesy sauce topped with some bbq ribs that just melt when you remove it from the bones. I absolutely recommend getting take out at Ganadara as their food quality and services remain the same and honestly I am so happy that this restaurant is still open! Please try this restaurant and support all the local restaurants as they are all struggling right now! Check out their menu on Instagram, prepare yourself with a food tray or portable small table, bring a friend or your partner in the car, order the food by calling their phone line and enjoy their food in the car with some good music! Just do it! Support your local & stay safe! Trust me, Ganadara's food will not disappoint you!"

When you enter you need to wear a mask. All their food servers are wearing masks, too. Since it's difficult to gauge your age with the mask, don't be surprised to be asked to show your ID. 2. There'a a hand sanitizer at the door for everyone before you go in3. The menu is disposable! They photocopied the menu so you won't have to touch yucky laminated menus or ipads!4. When assigning tables, they keep at least one table empty in between occupied tables to respect the social distance required.5. You may, of course, remove your mask when seated but you have to wear it when you walk around like if you have to go to the washroom.I felt safe and still enjoyed our dine-in experience!"
/user_details?userid=uN42kMPT0jlpgma2EMdQgw,Andy B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My family and I always loved Ganadara and used to line up for minutes to even hours in order to taste their food. Their quality went down within the last few months before their closure, but they definitely picked up where they left off at Bar Ganadara. I came here when it first opened before and the selection of dishes keeps on growing and growing. I will review each dish separately. This dish was shared with my dearest friend and we were 2 to enjoy this meal.To start off, the ambiance is amazing, the sanitary precautions are followed and there was a small lineup only on a Friday night. The decor is stunning!Salmon Tartare: The tartare is exquisite and very fresh. The seasoning is just right and you're always craving for more. (I even had to order 2!). I highly recommend getting this dish! Sadly, the Tuna Tartare was not available so I'll definitely try that last time. Sashimi Platter: The fish were fresh. The price was fair as well. Having tasted the most expensive sashimi tray before, I'd recommend getting this instead as you will get more bang for your buck! The plating is amazing as well. Corn Cheese: For 18$, I was somewhat disappointed with this dish. The authenticity of this dish is there, but the price point is a huge let down. I tried this dish as it caught my attention and had a craving for cheese. Needless to say, I won't be getting this again as I can make this at home for a fraction of the price. As for the taste, it was mediocre at best and could have used a bit more cheese. Grilled Squid: A wonderful appetizer. The squid taste is conserved and well seasoned throughout the whole dish. It remained hot for a long time (but not that long since it was finished rather quick). I highly recommend this dish if you are a fan of seafood. Jok ValJean: I ordered this dish as I saw it in their instagram post and I have mixed feelings about this. The original dish would be called Jok Bal, and the cut would involve pig trotters (""feet""). The twist made with pork belly was satisfying, but did not have that fatty essence from using pig trotters. Overall, the seasoning was good, but it definitely could have been ""better"".Overall, Bar Ganadara delivered and I definitely will come back here more than once. If you have not given it a try, it's never too late. Plan ahead as there is most certainly always a lineup, especially if you decide to go later at night (it is a bar after all). P.S.  Also try their drinks as they have tons of options and loads of soju flavours to choose from!!!"
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Ganadara offers delicious food and their sangria is amazing. The day that we went the place was particularly crowded knowing that we are living a pandemic. Very hot and humid temperature where everyone was with a piece of paper fan (which was the actual menu) fighting the heat. That being said I wanted to reiterate that there food is really good and flavoured.
/user_details?userid=lRYnvvo-Ia4tJQU4-dMmKg,Annabelle N.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has a nice decor with wood accents and high chairs.The waitor we had was really nice and helpful.We had:Eel dolsot: Dolsot is a stone bowl that remains hot. After mixing you should wait before eating. The rice at the bottom will crisp and give a nice crunch. The eel is well seasoned, a little on the sweet side. There's also some salad leaves which i don't like so much as they become mushy since the bowl is so hot. But the general taste is really good and satisfying. Sweet potato fries: loved!!  Crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The mayo also   is really good. I think there wad garlic and lemon in. Korean style chicken wings: Really liked this dish as it included a lot of vegetables including asparagus, potatoes, carrots, bamboo shoots etc.  The chicken wings had a lot of meat on them. Whole calamari:  this was also very satisfying.  Same mayo as the fries. Not too chewy but steamed just enough."

We ordered Nachos, Potato Wedges and Crispy Chicken for the table to share. Everything was delicious, but the Crispy Chicken was definitely a favourite. Drinks were good too! Service was excellent and friendly!! When they found out we had a birthday boy at the table, they sent a round of shots! Definitely coming here again!"

I took out my phone and googled Bar Ganadara, the sister site that was only a block down the street. Given there was construction going on top of the building it was harder to locate. With the winter entrance (curtained off to stop the cold), it gives off a speakeasy vibe but you'll be surprised. This place is happening! The music, the decor, the crowd- I was feeling all of it. I came after work for a quick bite on a Friday so I opted to sit near the bar. I ordered a bunch of food: the takoyaki skewer was really good (5/5), the kimchi (4/5), the Nagasaki udon noodles (6/5) that hot broth in my cold body was exceptionally delicious. The cocktails were fun- I had the yogurt soju one for 10$ that was recommended by the barmaid-it tasted like an icecream float! The downside was the seating arrangement, it gets crowded and congested quickly and in the winter they should do a better job blocking off the winter cold because I had to eat with my coat on the whole time."
/user_details?userid=EWGPtvOVdWTrjwOA5mZEiQ,Olivia V.,"Newport Beach, CA",4 star rating,"If I lived in Montréal, I'd probably swing by Bar Ganadara every weekend. This is a solid spot for tapas and drinks at a reasonable price, not to mention the aesthetics is on point! I came by with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night and we were pretty much seated right away at the bar. We ordered two drinks (Toktok + Seoul Mate) as well as a few skewers, takoyaki and the bulgogi nachos. The drinks were good, the skewers + takoyaki were definitely my favorite and the nachos really topped everything off. I do want to mention though, that the nachos didn't have as much bulgogi as we were hoping for (it was mostly chips) but still it was a good experience overall. I think this would be a great place for groups or even for dates. Definitely give it a try if you haven't already!"

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ya'll, can we all please keep Bar Ganadara in business? I will admit, I was not a fan of Ganadara (the location on Maisonneuve) but this location is completely different! Far more stylish, delicious food, good price, what more can you want? I came here on a lazy Sunday evening right before a downpour of rain, feeling not very hungry. When we arrived, we were seated immediately in a quiet area behind a screen near the front door. The decor is very moody and lounge like. Perfect to grab a drink in the afternoon or for a small group of people to eat dinner. Their AC was not working, so the hostess checked with us several times that we were sure we wanted to sit there. While we were fine initially, it did get quite hot by the time we finished our meals. She was very helpful in recommending items from the menu and we decided to start with takoyaki and get the salmon dupbap and fried chicken. These portions were so generous, especially the fried chicken, and absolutely delicious. We left feeling happy about how little we spent and how happy our bellies were. I highly recommend this place to others. It does get busy and a little crowded, but definitely worth the price. Can't wait to come back and try more things."

/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of the go to bars amongst my girlfriends and I. We love the food here and the drinks and service are good too. Pleasant atmosphere! I personally love the sashimi platter (chef's assorted platter) the most on the menu and their fried chicken as well as negasaki ramen/udon is good too. I recommend calling to reserve in advance if you want to come on a weekend! Line ups can get long.

The yogourt soju brings back like childhood memories because it's made with yakult! It would be such a good place to pre-game with friends before going out.

They placed our orders promptly.Food & DrinksA group of us went for drinks and bingsu. Their menu had drinks, snack foods, and dessert.We loved the yogurt soju ($28) and go two orders. I must say they had more ice than liquid, but the price was reasonable. The bingsu was overpriced in my opinion. Small portions so it was very difficult to share. The portion size was good for one person. The Injeolmi bingsu did not have rice cake/mochi/dduk. The tiramisu bingsu came with a shot of espresso and was loaded with lady fingers. The bottom had cookie crumbles. Overall, both were average."

Freshness is a must and the Chef did took care of that! The best part of all, they serve the sashimi with ice underneath- it's detailed, but it ensure the freshness from the first piece to the very last.The skewers combo is a fantastic idea, it gives you the chance to try a little bit of everything, I do wish the chicken skin to be a little bit more crispy but regardless, it's all very tasty."
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is my go-to bar hands down. It's in the perfect location, the staff are very pleasant and I can always manage to get a last minute reservations for groups!I have been here many times, although this is my first review of the place. I normally get their combos of food and drinks, which come with a pitcher of beer, nachos, potato wedges and fried chicken! The portions are quite generous, so it's great for sharing and their food is quite good! For nachos, you have the choice to top it with bulgogi beef or pulled pork (both are delicious). They also have a variety skewers, and a delicious salmon and eel bowls! As for drinks, the yogurt soju cocktail is great! They also offer a selection of flavoured soju (apple, grapefruit, peach, grape) - however, not all flavours are usually in stock so hopefully you're lucky. As much as the staff are friendly, sometimes it feels like they are under staffed and it can be quite hard to get a hold of one. Despite this, the food service is decent, I've never waited too long for my food. Overall, the food is good, the price is quite fair and affordable and the staff is pleasant! The only reason why this bar lost a star would be because they usually don't have the drinks or the soju flavour bottle I want and how difficult it can be to get a waiter/waitress. I'd recommend this place for groups, and since it's quite a popular spot, a reservation would be ideal during on Friday and Saturday!"

Vast selection of drinks and asian cocktails. The food is different from the main ganadara restaurant so it doesnt feel like eating the same things. The skewers set and the salmon dupbap is a must. The staff is friendly and nice and the service is great. The place is clean and the ambience is great. Highly recommended, especially if you like kpop :P"

I'm assuming it's because of the constant spills of beer and soju from the bar's patrons but it was off putting when we were sitting there.

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went there after being disapointed by the food from another restaurant. We needed a quick fix and drinks to drink away our sorrows. Went there on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and we ended up leaving around 2am. I guess the ambiance was good so we stayed. At first, it was pretty empty. But as the evening/night got along, it started filling up, and around 11pm/midnight it was pretty full. Food-wise, we ordered a combo which included a plate of fried chicken with potatoes, bulgogi nachos and a bottle of soju, which was perfect for us to start the night. The food is comparable to their main restaurant Ganadara, which is like a block away and super hyped with line-ups all the time. Ambiance-wise, when full, it was alive and nice. Service was good also. Overall, asian food/snacks with asian drinks are a great combo!"
/user_details?userid=VQenIJ5AzqURtDSUYv76rg,Joanna X.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Holy smokes... my friend from Montreal recommended me to this bar and let's just say... He did not let me down. This is probably one of the coolest and aesthetically pleasing Korean places I've been to. Service is friendly and amazing (very cute female/male servers too by the way). As for the food. I was more impressed than anything else. I've pretty much ordered everything on the menu in the skewers BBQ side (like 6 orders of everything...we had a lot of takeout too...). It would be best to go with more people so you can order everything and share. It's definitely a lot better to eat a piece of everything than eating the same thing all night.  Skewers wise, can't tell you which one would be better to order. Completely depends on personal preference of meat, but the SEAFOOD UDON... HOLY FISHES... It was awesome. Flavours are on point and the soup doesn't just taste like water and cheap seasoning. You can actually taste the seafood in the soup base! (this does not happen often so I got a little excited and also because I had a shot or two of alcohol before I ate...) OH YEA... they've got pretty interesting alcohol too. Don't drive because you're going to drink whether you like it or not."

We were famished after a day trip to Tremblant and were looking for some carb-filled dishes. Luckily Ganadara just had the right things in their sauted bulgogi udon and their salmon dupbap (hoedupbap).The udon still had very much the flavor profile of bulgogi and was more of a saucy version as opposed to a dry stir fried version. The noodles were nice and chewy and there were plenty of veggies. The dupbap was also pretty good. Their chogochujang was a bit off, as it was seemingly extra vinegary to the point it was almost on the cusp of sour. However, it was still was very much enjoyable. Just remember to mix the entire bowl for a more even tasting. And kudos for actually having spicy gochujang for once. I really liked the interior here, the tables/countertop were in a really unconventional manner but is aesthetically pleasing and works. Service was fine."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this place, I am regular, new items are added or modified every few weeks, so I never get bored of going there. Bar Ganadara is a good place if you want to grab a bite or just hang out with your friends and have a drink or two. The menu is really affordable which is perfect for students. My favorites are the salmon dupbap, the skewer set, umouk tang, the bulgogi nachos, and the injeolmi bingsu. I have tried most dishes on the menu and never thought that anything was bad. I look forward to my future nights at Gana Bar."

They have a good selection of tapas and meals if you're a little hungry. The atmosphere is nice, service is pretty good every time I've visited. I love they serve dessert which I've been going mainly to this place for a while (since I have a late night sweet tooth), but they have cut down the portions to almost half, if not less for their bingsu very recently. Still a fan of this place but a little heartbroken over their dessert portions. Still giving them a 4 star even though my dessert heart says 3."
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's a bar but they have excellent food. I cant speak of the restaurant of the same name down the street, but the food here really surprised me. I had the udon noodles and pork in creme sauce. It was like an alfredo sauce but the pork was just so tender. They also have skewers of meat you can order mix n match style, the meats were cooked well. They had a wide variety of drinks, but sadly I did not get the chance to try many because the service was really really lacking. The waiters never came over to take a second drink order once the food came. I had to flag the waiter down just to get a refill of water multiple times. It was so long and the place was empty! Maybe it was just a bad night, so I'm making a point to come back and try some of the awesome shaved iced desserts they have too."

(Many of my friends said it's the best noodle soup they've ever had). I really like the drinks too. Yogurt soju tastes more yogurt than soju though. But the Strawberry Toktok is nice and strong. The only thing is service can be a little slow because it gets very busy, but the servers do their best."

The bartenders seemed to be a little confused about their own drink menu both times we went, maybe they were new. There was much back and forth before the drinks appeared. Stand outs were the pork belly and chicken skin skewers, and the bingju injeolmi dessert."

We've been hesitant of trying BarGanadara from the beginning. Sadly we were disappointed and seems a common occurrence within Montréal due to lack of real competition.Food was decent (what was available) and the ambience was ok.Weekday 8pm and they were out of Soju and sashimi. Basically Bar Ganadara is trying to mimic an izakaya.

It was a tirimisu in shaved ice form, it didn't come out frozen. There was a shot of espresso to pour into the bingsu. The bingsu was soft, no chunks of ice in it. There were lady fingers and cheesecake bits (they were larger than the size of their tony spoons) in addition to their shaved ice.There weren't that many people inside when we went on a Saturday night, but it might also be because it's fairly new. It's pretty dark with music, but that's you would expect from a bar. But the hanging wood pieces looked really low, even for someone who's 5'3.My only real complaint would be the price of the bingsu. After tax, a little over $10. It was good but it was a little overpriced."

It was far and above the best Asian food I've had in this neighbourhood of Montreal recently. The grilled skewers were especially outstanding. Unfortunately, the service was very poor. This is a very large room and it seemed like there were only two people serving and bussing the entire restaurant. It was a long wait before ordering, and we left before we had intended to because we waited so long after appetizers before talking to anyone. When the bill arrived, it had multiple extra (expensive!) items we did not order on it, though this was resolved after we pointed it out. Overall disappointing, though the small taste we were able to get was very good."

We also shared the caramel/banana ice cream, it was really good. I think they mostly serve seafood but their meat is really good and well seasoned. In overral our food was really good. The costumer service is ok, they werent disrespectful, they were just really busy since there was alot of costumers so they didn't really take their time with you. It didn't bother me at all but for people who ask alot of question on the menu it could be a little problem but like I said they were pretty busy. I 100% recommand."

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Brand new bar from the owners of Ganadara. Was pleasantly surprised that there was no line to get in and actually, not many patrons inside. I think this was due to the fact that there's no large sign outside and the interior is so dark, it looks closed from the outside. I came here hoping to have the perfect marriage of Ganadara's signature fast-food type Korean dishes with some good cocktails (and without the lineup that always seems to plague the original location!). I was a bit disappointed at first view of the menu, since the menu is limited and not what you get at the other location. They had two sushi items, a few salads, meat skewers and some main courses, four of which revolve around an udon noodle saute with various meats or vegetables. I ordered the beef udon saute; I will say it was very tasty. The beef was tender and not at all chewy and the noodles were the perfect firmness, but I do wish there were more veggies/additional ingredients or even more noodles to plump the dish up a bit. The fried chicken dish, however, was huge!!! Four large pieces of fried chicken were laid on a bed of cabbage and sliced lemon, and came with a spicy red sauce. This plate is perfect to share as an appetizer IMO. I tried the cumin lamb skewers, and while the pieces of lamb were generous, I found the seasoning not as addicting as the one at Otto. For dessert, they offer bingsu. The cocktails were surprisingly ""not"" disappointing. I say this because I generally find Asian restaurants or pubs to be weak on the cocktail front, in that they usually don't contain much alcohol and don't have much complexity. Here, the whiskey sour was pretty good. If it had just a tad more sweetness to it to give it that perfect sweet/sour mix, I would have probably given it an 8/10. Alcohol content was decent. Prices for both food and drinks are reasonable, but not super cheap. It will be interesting to see how this place picks up as a bar and snack spot, considering the other options around (Otto, Kinka, Kampai, etc). I wish them luck!"

First time I went, it was at night and I think its the perfect time to experiment it. There's not as much food as the normal Ganadara because they focus more on drinks, but the short menu has some of the most exquisite things to eat AND add on sangria or a classic bottle of soju to with it ;). I totally recommend their fried chicken, it's heaven in a plate. I went there with some girlfriends to chill and drink, and the vibe is suuuper nice! The music is not to loud, the decor is majestic, the lounge music is soothing... Its a 10/10 for me! ;)"

It's a quite busy place, but waiters are trying their best to help you out.  Not many dishes are on the menu. I think they focus more on drinks instead of foods. A nice place to check out if you wanna try Korean drinks."

We found some restaurants who requires you to eat a meal in order to drink (huh!). We stumbled upon the Ganadara Restaurant on the other side of st-catherines and while they had Soju, there was a bit of a wait. When the waitress/hostess found out we were only looking to drink and not eat a meal, she pointed out the Ganadara Bar. We promply found the place and it was plesant from there on end. Its more like a Tapa's place where you can order small dishes on the side with your drink (perfect!). We tried to get the Lamb Rack but they were out so got the Lamb on skewer which was delish and we ordered some more of that. We also got our Soju and was very happy! In fact we returned the next night for some more. The atmosphere inside is HIP and the hostess/waitress and waiters are very polite and on top of their game. Next time we are in town, we will most def hit up this place!"
