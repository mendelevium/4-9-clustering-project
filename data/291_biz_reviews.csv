I can't even get over how deliciously mouth watering this poutine was!!! The serving was massive! We read a review from someone saying how disappointed they were that the servings are smaller since Covid - what is wrong with you?! No one should be eating a poutine this size by themselves! We didn't even think we could finish it...but we did  It was THAT good!!! A must try when in Montreal."

We both ordered Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. They were delicious. Fries were great. Comes with a pickle. They offer mayo with the fries which I loved. I even liked the coleslaw. (My boyfriend did not). The service was friendly but on the slower side. We would definitely return next time we are in Montreal. Everything they brought out from the kitchen looked amazing. We took our leftovers home with us, but we found out later the container leaked and it got all over my boyfriends new jeans."
/user_details?userid=NNL1zLTP2J_SOputgoPYeQ,Alex L.,"Buffalo, NY",4 star rating,"Needed to obviously indulge in Poutine while in Montreal and Dunn's was an easy option close to the hotel that was open for 24 hours. The service was a tad stiff, but being that the place is open 24/7, I don't blame if the guy was tired.Had the french onion soup and the Montreal smoked meat poutine. Loved the french onion - it was delicious with the melted cheese and bread and a tasty broth. The poutine was great too. Crispy fries, delicious gravy and tasty smoked meat. All in all - a solid option for poutine in Montreal. It's just fries with gravy, after all."

It was around two pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday, we just arrived in Montreal and were craving poutine... we wanted to go to the best place and we definitely found it! We're planning on going again at least one more time... so many more poutine flavours to try out!"
/user_details?userid=uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,"Stopped by here with a party of five to soak up some excess booze. Open 24 hours, this place was surprisingly quiet for a Friday late night, as we were easily able to get a booth.Wasn't looking for anything large, settling on the plate of Chicken Wings (8 for $9). Wings are fried well though not slathered with any sauce; instead you choose one to the side (decided on the sweet & spicy). Okay flavor overall, and the side of carrots/lettuce are nominal. Looking around, probably would have been better to get a poutine instead,Service is quick and the place is kept together well despite being an overnight establishment."
/user_details?userid=kbHkMCQPrrgIKMgjUeMP_g,Kristin F.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",4 star rating,"Summary: If you're a tourist and looking to try poutine and smoked meat of Montreal, Dunn's is a great place to start! Prices are a little high as it is pretty touristy but food is yummy! Would recommend to give it a try if you're visiting Montreal for the first time like me.My husband and I both ordered the Small smoked meat combo (6 oz smoked meat sandwich, side of fries, coleslaw, and a half pickle) for $16.50 CAD. We both replaced the fries for poutine for an extra $4 CAD. Their smoked meat is well seasoned, but not as good as its competitors. The side order of poutine was pretty big and it was pretty good, although this was my first time trying poutine so I don't have much to compare it to.Like I mentioned in my summary, I would recommend Dunn's to tourists coming through Montreal and wanting to try the infamous smoked meat sandwich and poutine for the first time, but there may be better places for both.The wait staff was great and attentive. We visited on a Friday night around 5pm, beating the dinner rush."

/user_details?userid=syCxRdiP-0XJenWpJ8L02g,Cindy L.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Checked this place while I was in the area and I love smoked meat but I much prefer Reubens. Came here in the afternoon, most of the restaurant was empty. Ordered the mini smoked meat sandwich with fries and requested no mustard on the sandwich. But guess what? Yes that's correct, the sandwich arrived with mustard. It wasn't even busy but somehow the chef still made an error. I couldn't even locate a server so I just ate it to correct the mistake and left disappointed. Oh and the smoked meat tasted more on the dry side as well so it wasn't that appealing. Left such a bad impression here. I wouldn't recommend especially with so many options for smoked meat in Montreal. Even if the restaurant is not busy, I think the servers still should be attentive to the customers that do decide to dine here. Sorry but I would not return."

/user_details?userid=936r8HQQtwpu8FTmVX-9rA,Aaron T.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"If you are in Montreal and didn't order smoked meat were you really in Montreal at all??Dunn's was not on our radar for list of restaurants to go to. We walked by on our way over for dinner at another place and saw the big red sign that said OPEN 24H outside of Dunn's. After another late night of shenanigans we quickly thought of Dunn's which was not disappointing at all. I ordered their Reuben sandwich served with sauerkraut and thousand island dressing,  fries, coleslaw and a pickle spear. The meat was fatty enough that it melts in your mouth but not greasy that would make you sick. The portion was big I think big enough to share with someone if you aren't overly hungry.They are a bar style so the servers are a little more laid back easy and friendly to talk to. They are very attentive and will come around filling our glasses up with ice water.Another solid place for a late night munchie run if you're in the downtown area."
/user_details?userid=XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA,Jose C.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Dunn's initially wasn't in my plans. I have a list of restaurants that I want to try but most of the Montreal restaurants were outside of downtown, and I was needing something close to the Bell Centre. I was also craving poutine and after doing a quick search, Dunn's looked promising. It was really packed and I was fortunate to find a seat at the bar. I already knew what I came for but I quickly scanned the menu, just in case I saw something else that was appealing. I ordered their Dunn's Famous poutine. Being in Montreal, why wouldn't you get poutine with smoked meat? You'd be crazy not to honestly. Poutine is already good as it is. And Dunn's version is no exception. The fries were very tasty and perfectly cooked. Not too soggy or too crispy. Topped with a very delicious gravy and tasty cheese curds. But this version topped with smoked meat just went over the top. It was a huge portion you could probably get away with sharing it. But I was by myself so luckily for me I didn't have to share, but had the challenge of finishing it. If I'm ever back in town, I wouldn't hesitate returning. Their service was great. Prompt and extremely friendly."

Wow this shit was so good. Super tender and flavorful. It would fall off the bone if it came with a bone. And the poutine is great too. Just really good quality canadian poutine. The desserts were yummy although our tummies were busting already. We got the molten chocolate cake and carrot cheesecake. Gotta say the carrot cheesecake was my favorite no raisins
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Dunn's Famous is one of the few places in town that are open 24/7. I've never been! They're located next door to Dominion Square Tavern and have two other locations in town. We dropped in on a Monday (around 2:30am) and it was surprisingly busy. Our waitress was friendly and helpful for our massive group of 12. The menu is huge but I only had eyes on their smoked meat options. It's a given that you should try their speciality.- Le petit combo ($14.50) - small sandwich served on rye bread with fresh cut fries, coleslaw and dill. Small is an understatement; this is a filling meal. The sandwich was hefty with generous slices of smoked meat. Tender, fatty goodness; perfect after a late night out. The coleslaw was refreshing but the dill pickle was bad. The fries were okay but needed more time in the deep fryer. - Smoked meat fried rice ($14.00) - a fusion dish. There was smoked meat, bell peppers, mushrooms, broccoli and onions topped with diced tomatoes and shallots. Turns smoked meat was diced too finely but the tomatoes were refreshing to the palate. Decent.Solid late night downtown spot to grab food. Stick with the smoked meat sandwiches. 3.5 stars."

Luckily it was walking distance from our hotel (Hotel Bonevature), took us less than 10 minutes to get here.Once inside, we got seated fairly quickly. I also think it wasn't too busy since we came on a weekday night (Wednesday). The booths have cute little individual coat hangers you can use too!I ordered the French Onion Soup & Sausage Poutine. Hubby ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich & Richard's Red Ale. The server was super nice & had asked if I want the soup to come out first, or to have all the food come out at the same time. I told him we wanted it all at on once. So all our food came out pretty quick, about 15 minutes or so. My favorite hands down was the French Onion Soup!! The cheese melted was on point & I absolutely loved the broth. I practically picked up the bowl to drink it, lol. The Poutine was good too, but personally I like the regular Poutine more (just cheese & gravy). My hubby really liked the Smoked Meat sandwich and his beer. He said the meat's texture was perfect and taste was awesome. It also comes with coleslaw & pickles & fries, yum! The servings are pretty big by the way, so we ended taking some of our food to go.Overall, great spot & would def return again! Good food, good staff , & good location."

I ordered a small combo and upgraded my fries for poutine which cost an additional $4. The small combo is a sandwich with white bread and smoked meat, with side of coleslaw, pickle. Both the smoked meat and poutine were served steaming hot. I could only finish maybe a third of the poutine but managed to finish everything else! I was given 2 choices for the black cherry Coke, either can of Cott or on tap. The food is standard as Dunn's has now become a chain at multiple locations including Toronto.I arrived around 6:30pm and throughout the evening there were a steady stream of customers. I only saw about 3 servers but they were attentive and did not have to wait long after placing my order."

Wouldn't say it was the best, but it was pretty good!And the server was attentive, efficient, and very personable. He might have been a manager because the other servers were asking him things.The thing that brought it down to a 4 star was because my friend ordered the classic (Quebecois), and they weren't that many cheese curds."

I visited for 1 night from Toronto and chose the hotel down the street in order to visit this place. Arrived extremely late... at 3am.. and luckily Dunn's famous was a 3 min walk and open. I eat Montreal smoked beef ALL THE TIME and was extremely excited to try it IN Montreal! I tried the Dunn's famous smoked meat sandwich (asked without mustard but they put it in anyway... so that wasn't good.!). The smoked meat was UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS! So juicy, tender, hot and nicely marinated. With it i ordered the Dunn's famous poutine . It was a huge Poutine with the perfect cheese curds and the same delicious smoked meat on top. Yumm!! I also got a spicy crispy chicken burger ... very flavorful! And i got an extra crispy chicken patty and extra of their spicy mayo.I loved it!"

Especially for drunk food, a lot of fried food- it was okay but I don't recommend it in the day. I also thought that it was a tad over priced for what it was but I guess for the area it's normal. Overall it wasn't great but it was better than starving."
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been trying the smoke meat restaurants downtown near where I work and I've been to Dunn's a few times but never wrote a review (since this was before I joined Yelp). I decided to stop by here recently during lunch.Closest metro to this place is Peel and the restaurant is located between Ste-Catherine and Rene Levesques area.When I went there, there was a terrasse in the front but I decided to sit inside. I went inside and was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table/booth. I decided to sit at the bar.I was given the menu and looked at the lunch specials. I was surprised that their lunch specials did not include any smoke meat sandwich plates. I decided to order a smoke meat sandwich (which came with the usual dill pickle, coleslaw, and fries) and just have water. I was asked whether I wanted lean or medium and I opted for medium. In the first place that I sat down in the bar which was directly in front of the draft beer dispenser, there seemed to be a lot of flies so I asked the server if I could change seats and she mentioned that it was fine so I decided to move to a few seats away.Within a few minutes, someone came with my order. The coleslaw was very good. The fries were very good as well. The smoke meat wasn't the type of smoke meat that I preferred since I like it to be a bit drier and ""flakier"" but it was good nevertheless.The place got very crowded very fast during my lunch. When I showed up at around 11:55am, the place was crowded (but not 100% full) and I was seated immediately. By the time I was about to leave (~12:35pm), there was a line of people waiting to be seated.I would rank the experience/food 3 stars. Service wise, I didn't get my water refilled during my meal and what type of deli or smoke meat place doesn't have a smoke meat sandwich in their lunch menu prices but has other things like fish & chips?!?! Most people going to a place like Dunn's Famous would be going for the smoke meat and not fish & chips or the other stuff shown on their lunch menu"

The location is good and close to train station. The French onion soup was surprisingly great. There were lots of veggies and Bacon adding in the poutines which we liked very much. The smoked meat taste decent and not too salty compared to smoked meat I had in other restaurant.

The staff is friendly, it's good for kids.I would highly recommend this place.  They also have hot dogs, pizzas, fish and chips and sandwiches.  They have a few different types of Poutines such as the Dunn's famous which has smoke meat.  My husband really enjoyed it. The Molson beer  was delicious.  Cheers!!"
/user_details?userid=itNrmwmb2Tm-LKkh2kbBAg,Val D.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"I'm glad there's a restaurant that a family with kids can eat at that closes late in the heart of downtown Montreal. Although a little pricey like all other restaurants in downtown, they compensate their price with huge servings which can be shared with 2 people.  They are part of a chain, where you can find other dunns restaurants in other areas.Salad - 3 1/2 stars - basic, but a whole big bowl full to be eaten as a meal or shared as a side salad.Smoked meat poutine - 3 1/2 stars - super huge serving of poutine, but was a bit too salty.Margarita - 4 stars - they make it sweet in Canada with a strong coconut flavor.Service - 4 stars - although only one waitress, food came decent time.Easy to find because we could see  their huge vertical red lit sign from a block away, but because it's in the heart of Montreal, only street or paid parking lot around the area.  Since we were staying at a hotel a block away, I'm glad they were open since most of the eating places in the area that open late were only bars."
/user_details?userid=CaaGjAM1yL_t4yhNLD3f_g,Adele W.,"Pickering, Canada",5 star rating,So. Much. Food!! I can't go to Montreal and NOT have smoked meat and poutine! We were here for the Grand Prix last weekend and had to stop in to Dunn's once again for our fill of deliciousness. We were seated immediately and the service was quick and efficient. I ordered the large smoked meat sandwich and upgraded to poutine. My husband got the Ruben and also upgraded to the poutine. Everything was so delicious and we received way more than we expected. This restaurant was recommended to me last year by a friend and it was so good we came back. It will definitely be a Grand Prix weekend staple!Love it.

It's served in a big bowl topped with gravy and smoked meat. I think the fries would preserve more crispiness if it was served in a plate, more spread out. But who knows, I'm no poutine expert. Maybe it's supposed to be served like this.By the 5 minute mark, it was all just very soggy and not that enjoyable. But it was a huge amount of food! and the meat was not bad.I'd probably just make my way to one of the other poutine joints or Schwartz's next time."

/user_details?userid=zoA4G79atCGUpACqklty-Q,Karen B.,"Alberta Beach, Canada",5 star rating,"It was 4:30 pm when we arrived, tired and hungry after our long journey from out West. The dry airline pretzels our only sustenance up to now. The sign beckoned us, like a sign from A higher power, ""Dunn's Famous"". I fell to my knees and wept, at long last, my precious. Montreal Smoked Meat. I spotted a sign from above ""Massage"". Perhaps a massage while covered with smoked meat? One could only dream of such things. It was early enough in the day that we were quickly ushered to a quiet, out of the way booth at the back. I hoped the waitress wasn't offended by my inquiry about the ""meat massage"". We ordered up a couple frosty pints and chugged them with reckless abandon, the memory of our meagre airplane fare still fresh in our minds. When hubby and I were married a blissful 10 years ago, he made a deal with a foodie. The deal was this, if I call ""sharesies"" then we are bound by matrimony to order things we could share so that no one person has to suffer by inadvertently ordering a ""lesser dish"". And so it was, that we ordered the Super Combo Smoked Meat and Dunn's Famous Poutine. To share.The food arrived at a breakneck speed, I barely had time to check out the vintage photographs lining the hallowed walls.The food, ahhhh, the food! Tender and buttery soft smoked meat, ordered ""lean"" because hubby doesn't appreciate connective tissue and fat. Alas, that's one of the colossal responsibilities of ""sharesies"", to take the other parties preferences into consideration. The delicately sliced meat was piled high, high, high, and nestled in between two little slices of incredibly fresh rye bread with a light smear of mustard. Nothing more was needed. A generous side of crispy fries, a saucer of fresh slaw and a slice of dill pickle. Perfection. Not one iota of pretension to be found.The poutine was perfect. Hot and tasty fries, fresh, melty cheese curds covered with gravy and topped with chopped Montreal smoked meat. Uncomplicated and flawless.Having lived my smoked meat ""foodie"" dreams, I believe I could die happy at this very moment. Except...we have 6 more days of culinary discoveries ahead. I was born for this moment."
/user_details?userid=FPv27CkYLodbfz3gj5Fnkg,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"From what I can see, Dunn's is a localized version of a TGIFriday's which is perfectly fine. They have several locations around Montreal and their claim to fame is smoked meats. Think New York style pastrami. Of course like a TGIFriday's, they have a ton of other menu items. This location also happens to be 24/7 - another plus. I don't especially enjoy breakfast foods, so a full menu restaurant at 8am is perfect for me. I was planning on getting Schwartz later for smoked meat (think Katz Deli) so I opted for an Uber driver recommendation of hot chicken. This isn't the Nashville version so don't confuse the two. It's essentially a shredded chicken sandwich drenched in Salisbury steak gravy and topped with peas. Be warned, not everyone will enjoy this sandwich. I personally did. It reminded me of childhood when I religiously ate microwaved HungryMan Salisbury steak TV dinners. The waitress was also very attentive. I'd come back again to try the rest of the menu."
/user_details?userid=w7vcKaXAZU_6ZTPs_R60TQ,Max H.,"Agawam, MA",2 star rating,Ok so I'm not sure what Dunn's is famous for but I pray it isn't their poutine. Pretty pedestrian at best.Ok so i had poutine for the 1st time in Portland Me 3 yrs ago and ever since then I've tried to recreate the 1st time when I venture into a place that has poutine. Sadly nothing was on the same playing field. Anywho a few months back I saw a video on  a popular Youtube  food channel where the host went on a poutine eating adventure in Montreal. Ever since then I've been pretty hyped about a work trip we had scheduled in Montreal. TBH this wasn't the top of my list of places to try but it was the closest within walking distance of my hotel with pretty good reviews so I figured what the hell... Myself and some coworkers split a couple of the poutines (classic and famous). The famous is topped with smoked meat that was ok...not really great flavor. The biggest disappointment was the cheese curds were cold and lacked the pop you get when you bite into one. The gravy was also pretty bland. Bottom Line: Go for something other than poutine. I heard from a local after going that the cheesecake is excellent so try that if you must. If you do want excellent poutine check out La Banquise...it restored the poutine Montreal hype.

It shows its roots and is touristy. Seating is stall style. The food makes up for the age. The French fries are fresh cut and nicely cooked. The smoked meat sandwich is overfilled with meat- really good. Coleslaw appears to be made on site it's nice crunchy but a bit heavy on sugar.Pro tip. Eat the fries quickly as they will cool.Ice tea is premix with sweetener and lemon flavoring - in my case - yucky. Water or beer draft is a much better choice.

For my food I got the chop chop poutine (poutine with chopped smoked meat). It was ok, personally nothing special, and smoked meat albeit chopped up small pieces just didn't have a great taste to me. Along with the poutine, I had a order of their buffalo wings. Straight to the point: chicken is bland and not good. Even though the sandwiches are the number one thing, I probably won't be back to try."
/user_details?userid=CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"DINER HEAVEN This is the original location of Dunn's Famous that opened in 1927. It's a diner that serves a little bit of everything. Our mission was to have the smoked meats and poutine. We arrived after 1pm when the Canadians hockey game started up the street. We wanted to plan it that way, so there wouldn't be a wait for a table. I want to say that we timed it perfectly. In fact, it started getting crowded as we were waiting for our food here. The best part is that the game was on the tv and we could enjoy watching it. Our waiter was Fred and he was really nice. He was able to answer all of our questions and provided excellent service. We started out with two beers for us and a bowl of soup for the little one. I went with a Rickard's Red and my wife had a Coors light. I told her that the Coors was basically Canadian beer since Molson was brewing it up the street using Canadian water. The Coors in Canada has no Rocky Mountain Water in it. The soup was really good. Imagine a baked potato that was turned into a creamy soup and then covered with all of the baked potato toppings including cheese and bacon.  The dish is brilliant because baked potatoes come free with entrees and I'm assuming the left over potatoes become soup. I love smart chefs. I do highly recommend the warm soup on a cold day. This soup hit the spot because it was totally cold in Montreal. I also wanted to try poutine for the first time. I can not believe I've spent my culinary life avoiding this. I really didn't want to eat it in America. I think I wanted my first poutine to be an original and that's why I ordered it here. I also kept it simple by going with the gravy and cheese curds on top of the fries. I must admit that it was really good plus I had to fight my little one when eating these. I find it amazing to introduce brown gravy and curds to a child who instantly falls in love with the dish. I've got a little foodie on my hands. Our main entree was the Ruben sandwich which was huge. It comes with fries, baked potato or rice. You can always upgrade the side for a price. We went with the onion rings for an additional $3. I figured we had enough fries with the poutine. The sandwich was amazing and it was enough to feed all three of us. It was a double decker served with a pickle, Swiss cheese, thousand island sauce and coleslaw on the side. It was truly delicious. I also want to share some info about the meat. Montreal is famous for their smoked meats and the process they use really shows in the final product. A Montreal meat is brined for 14 to 20 hours and then smoked for 9 hours. Where an American corned beef is rushed with a brining as short as a few hours and then the meat being steamed for three hours. The Montreal version of corned beef will blow away your foodie senses. The meat is basically a beef brisket and when you order your sandwich you can choose one of three cuts: fatty, medium or lean. We stick to the medium because we want that flavor marbled in the meat. The Montreal smoked meat dates back to the 1890's, so it's a must have. I highly recommend you get the smoked meats in Montreal. There are several old school places serving it. We choose this place because it's been doing it the longest. I wanted to go to a classic place that's been doing it right for almost 100 years. I can't wait to come back here.

Imagine if the corned beef and the pastrami had the perfect baby. It was that good.Service was good, and our drinks were refilled without asking.  The poutine was good, but the smoked meat was even better... did I mention it was amazingly good?During our stay in Montreal, we tried 4 other places who supposedly had great smoked meats.  I would come back to Dunn's in a heartbeat, and best of all... they are open 24/7"

It's definitely been a while but we are starting our adventure in Montreal this time. Being I was hungry and just got into the city, I decided to stop by for a late night snack. The poutine selection was endless but I decided to get their famous poutine.The poutine came in a pretty big bowl with melted cheese and Montreal smoked meat sprinkled on top. I wish the fries were a bit crispier but this is one of those places where the cheese curds are actually melted. The flavor of the gravy was good but was slightly saltier than I expected. It was still very good though! To finish off the night, I tried their chocolate cake and strawberry cheesecake dessert. Both of them were good and I had a tough time deciding which was better.Being it was a bar, the staff were pretty laid back and I had to wave then over to take our orders. The staff were very friendly though.I shared my poutine and dessert with my girlfriend as there was no way I could finish by myself. For the amount of food they gave, 20ish bucks was a steal!In conclusion, I have other poutine places to try but they definitely make a mean poutine. Also the fact that it is open 24 hours you can sate your poutine desires at any time. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"

Luckily our hotel was around the corner from Dunn's and we were able to make this happen as soon as we arrived.Dunn's is a casual spot - basically like a hybrid diner / deli. The menu had a variety of different types of sandwiches, poutine and grill food. Because Montreal is known for poutine and smoked meat we opted for a big bowl of poutine topped with smoked meat. This wasn't the best pastrami that I've ever had, but was still delicious and tasted great mixed with the poutine. I also ordered a crock of french onion soup which was topped with tons of cheese and had great flavor. Nothing better when the high is below zero degrees!We washed everything down with some cold Molson (okay, if you can't tell we were excited to be in Canada) and were in and out in under an hour. Overall, Dunn's is a solid pick if you want a fast hot lunch in Montreal."

This is a perfect sized lunch for two people. -the smoked meat sandwich was just as good as Schwartz's without the long wait.

This place is popular enough but without the insanity of lines. We stopped by early in the afternoon on a weekend and were seated immediately. I got their reuben smoked meat sandwich and subbed out the fries for poutine (+$4), which was 100% worth it. At this point in my trip, I still haven't had any poutine. I probably should have gone with the la petite sandwich because I could only finish about 3/4 of my meal. The poutine was great and just as good as I imagined it would be. The smoked meat sandwich was good but not as good as the one I had a day earlier at another restaurant. The bread was a little too dry around the edges, so I ended up peeling off the crust. Overall, a good value and place to stop by if you want something casual and local."

Know that the gravy is a little salty and very savory, so saaavoooryyyy!The sandwich and fries were big enough for us to split with extra bread (I added lettuce and tomato, yeah I know, but it was tasty) and some dijon Maille mustard, so good.  The texture and taste is like pastrami ad brisket had a Canadian baby, a meaty tasty baby.  We were stuffed after, but I spotted the lone biscuit/cookie in a cake plate.  I could not resist and Im glad I could not.  It was so soft and delicious!  I recommend you try and snag a few.  The other standout were the smoked meat spring rolls, I wish I got some for the road, they were amazing.The bathrooms (the mens entrance was a little crazy looking, with missing/broken tiles) were downstairs (not so good for the handicapped patrons).  Otherwise, try it out.  It has a lot of history in this city for good reason.  Good food and decent prices."

(It was myself and twin brothers birthday of all days)   We came here after a long day of being out exploring all things worth while and this was a 24 hr late night place that was recommended.   We were seated shortly after entering and provided menus by who we now know was the bus boy. There was a short bald headed Asian guy sitting at the booth closest to the kitchen who looked like he worked there, but just stared at us. We sat there for about 10 minutes before I had to get up and ask if we could please have some water. The bus boy brought us water and we sat almost another 10 minutes when a couple walked in, the bald Asian guy got up, seated them, gave them a menu, took their drink order and a short while later brought their drinks and took their order. (I'm speechless and trying not to be bothered by it)   I asked the Caucasian guy who seated us if it would be possible to order to which he replied ""I'm not your waiter"" (he wasn't rude, but it threw us off because no one else came by at all). The couples food came out, the bald Asian guy took it to them and then came over, did not greet us, but he took our order. I was hungry but did not order as I refuse to spend money when I'm not being treated fairly which appeared to be a prejudice on the Asian guys part (I want to be clear on the nationality so readers are aware who this is I'm speaking of as it was one individual.)   The bus boy brought our food out, and no one ever came back to the table. The bald Asian guy continued to stare as though he had a problem. I had to get up and get napkins for the table, and when we were ready to go and still no one checked on us, our gal pal had enough. She called for service, a togo box and the bill. The bald Asian guy comes to the table and my friend asks who our waiter is to which he replies ""Me"", she told him we wouldn't know because we haven't received service and with the exception of taking our order he hasn't been back once. He never apologized and gave us the bill.    I paid the bill, left no tip and we walked out. Some may know what it feels like being mistreated based on prejudice, but I'm aware some have the privledge of not having experienced it. Its an awful feeling when you've done nothing at all and are spending money.   I can't in good conscious recommend this place to anyone...it was very disrespectful and without cause.

I ordered a petit combo which was half a smoked meat sandwich, coleslaw and fries. Your typical platter. Zero complaints.  I do love the Montreal style of coleslaw (no mayo like its American counterpart).I've yet to try Schwartz.

The bun was old.No sauce just simply disgusting.I can't believe I went back here twice in once week if I could give them a 0 star I would.One woman in the resto asked for the manager to ask why their was no chicken in her hot chicken and everyone turned around the manager just added some more same plate it's disgusting behaviour I will never return and be sure to let everyone know.

The buffalo chicken wrap that I received was basically a lettuce wrap with poor quality wings sauce. I would not eat that dish again even if they paid me $20 to finish it.

Ten minutes later, it seemed like an entire middle school or high school took over the restaurant, so it became super loud/noisy. This is a very casual place, so I couldn't get too irked by the crowd.The smoked meat here was absolutely delicious. The meat was so tender and fell apart. I loved that there were three choices: lean, medium fat, or super fatty. I opted for the medium fat, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.

Together, we had the Thai chicken wrap, French onion, bagel with smoked meat, and smoked Club - all dishes, whose fries side was upgraded to a Dunn's style poutine (fries, gravy, cheese curds, and more smoked meat, ho yeah!). It was all incredibly heavy and dense, but delicious. The meal was perfectly smoked and surprisingly tender (and this is me, a new yorker saying this) - the soup was a bit salty for my liking, but had a great baked fromage on top. The Thai chicken wrap had barely any kick even though the waitress warned us of one, and the slaw was a good complement to the saltiness of everything else. Even though I was off put by the heaviness of the gravy poutine, I can still admit it was stellar.We ended our meal with a slice of strawberry cheese cake to share, and even though they had a layer or strawberry gelatin as a bed for the Strawberries, the cake was well balanced in decadence - not the heavy packed cream cheese block you see at a lot of places, but crumbly  as it should be, leaving a satisfaction without feeling like you're cheating.Definitely enjoyed our meal, but still worried about my arteries!"

Yea, that was me when I saw smoked meat in the window.They have a pretty vast menu so I'm assuming there's something for everyone. My bf ordered the smoked meat sandwich and I ordered the poutine with smoked meat on top. The smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. The meat was tender and fatty and damn near melted in my mouth. The poutine was ok. I'm not sure why, but the smoked meat on the sandwich was a lot better than the smoked meat on top of the poutine. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. It was kinda watery. I prefer gravy that's a bit thicker.The service was awful. We were greeted and given menus when we walked in but people kept walking by us until finally we had to flag someone down for waters. Then, they took our order (finally). It took forever to get the check and no one ever stopped in to see if we needed anything else. We ate, paid, and got the hell outta there.

We asked our hotel's concierge where could we find a good smoked meat restaurant and he directed us in the right direction! So off to Dunn's Famous! We started our meal with wings (with the Buffalo sauce on the side). Now, as Americans we are wing connoisseurs, however, among wings connoisseurs your tastes may vary. Some like their wings fried very hard, some not so much. I'm on the ""not so much side"" which is why I gave this Restaurant overall 5 stars, but I didn't really care for the wings. My boyfriend, and most of my friends, prefer that their wings be friend hard, not me, and to me they were fried way toooo hard but the sauce did make up for it. But now on to the main event...the smoked meat. We both had the smoked meat plate which was smoked brisket on rye with mustard, and sorry, I insisted on adding Swiss cheese to my sandwich. It came with house made chips (fries) and homemade coleslaw. Yummmmm! Now the coleslaw was a bit different from what I'm used to. Everywhere I've been in Montreal, the coleslaw has been vinegar based and not mayonnaise based and I'll admit I really enjoyed it. It had a much lighter taste.Now as far as the sandwich is concerned, interesting. Now I'm from Philadelphia, PA and I grew up in Jewish Delis. Shout out to Murray's Deli and Hymie's Deli on Lancaster Avenue in Bala Cynwyd, PA. Best deli sandwiches ever. But back to my review, I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and it was so large that I could only eat 1/2 of the sandwich, 1/5 of my fries yet all of the coleslaw.  Delicious!! And the crazy part is that they're open some insane schedule, like 24 hours. Our server was great and she was very knowledgeable. I believe her name was Ali and she had quite a sense of humor. Yo be maybe 20 something, she ran that restaurant like it was no one's business. So if you are looking for great smoked meat, or are hungry after everything else is closed check out Dunn's. You won't be disappointed."

Schwartz was closing so we opted for Dunn's- open 24 hours!Both of us weren't particularly hungry as we had already eaten all day, so we decided to share the Rueben which comes with coleslaw, pickles and fries. We added smoked meat spring rolls. The total was about $25.The atmosphere was a classic 1960s diner which i loved. The place was quite packed. The service was appropriate as the waitress was busy.Tastewise everything was on point. Compared to Schwartz, the smoked meat at Dunn's is more fatty and moist which carries more flavour and with the cheese, dressing and self-applied mustard it was an explosion in the mouth. The Korean boy grinned with ecstasy. The meat at Schwartz is cooked longer, less moist but carries a bit more texture. The fries were crispy, and the coleslaw and pickles really balanced everything well.The Korean beast and I could have easily ordered another, the food was extremely satisfying.

It wasn't busy. These kids just don't care! And, whatever, maybe it's their summer job to work in this poutine-slingery, but do your job right and attend to people who are ultimately paying your wages.I ordered poutine with mushrooms, onions and peppers. And was so disappointed. The dish came out SO FAST that there's no way the veggies were freshly prepared. The fries were already soggy, and the lack of cheese curds (seriously, there needed to be way more of those delicate little gems) made me an unhappy diner. And speaking of diner; what is this place? A soda stand? An indoor barn? It just emits a weird vibe and had a weird smell and overall, mehhhhhhh.The next day I had some poutine in the airport on my way home and it slayed this place.

Yes, it's not the friendliest nor the fastest service - and there's always a line-up (unless you go really late at night, which I highly recommend btw, great vibe with the staff!). BUT they know how to make their smoked meat!!And when I'm either too far or too lazy to get to Schwartz's, my go-to place is Dunn's! Their smoked meat is satisfying - and has a nice fatty, marbling texture to it. Their fries are super crispy and good!

Usually the service is alright here, but there have been a handful of times I've gotten service that is beyond terrible.  I'm not talking they were slow or forgot to fill our drinks terrible.  I'm talking they slammed drinks on the table, dropped food on our laps and acted like we were bothering them when we would do a simple thing like ordering. On top of this the portions have gotten much smaller and the smoked meat just doesn't cut it compared to other places around town.  This definitely is not a place I frequent anymore and it's mainly due to the staff."

I didn't see what was so special about the smoked meat sandwich. It was tender but bland to me. Also, it had some gristle. To be fair, this is what I found with the other smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal. The fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious. I would have been interested to try other things here because the rest of the food looked good. The guy that took my order was pleasant and the service was good.They have their own cardboard box with their graphic design for take out, I like it for two reasons. One, it wasn't styrofoam, so it's better for the environment. Two, even though you're gonna toss it when you get home, you're bringing a piece of Dunn's with you with and to enjoy a little history about the place while you eat. I thought that was a nice touch."

The place is a diner but the servers and waiters were all friendly. We ordered the smoked meat platter (1/2 pound of smoked meat!!) and the smoked meat spring rolls. The smoked meat was very fatty and juicy, perfect for a late night snack after being on a bus for 5 hours. It came with 4 slices of rye bread (not toasted), sauerkraut and 1/2 a dill pickle. Very filling and a large portion enough for 2. The spring rolls were so disappointing. This is why the review is 4 stars. Typical Chinese spring roll, with veggies (cabbage, carrot) with a little smoke meat with American-ized sweet and sour sauce on top. I ordered this instead of a poutine because of another Yelper's review and sounded intriguing (we are Asian). Could you imagine though, a spring roll stuffed with smoked meat and the thin crispy skin? Man. Could've been sooo much better. Anyways, I'd definitely come back since it's 24-hours, closer than Schwartz or the Main, and definitely will have to try the poutine.

(Decor here very dated).Too bad had high hopes, based upon local recommendations."

/user_details?userid=O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,Teena D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Montreal is famous for its smoked meat sandwiches so Gord and I had lunch today at Dunn's.  Gord and I both ordered Super Smoked Meat Combos (8 ounces of meat) with medium meat (so it was less lean).  Gord got his with a latke and I got mine with a baked potato. It was a delicious sandwich!  The meat was so tasty and tender.  Yum! Rebeccah was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us.

The kids menu had lots to offer, the server friendly and professional, and of course the smoked meat was extremely good.I had a Reuben, and it came accompanied by a tasty sweet Cole slaw and dill. Not too much sauce on the sandwich, and the cheese and sauerkraut were just enough flavours to be good company for the meat.I upgraded the fries to poutine and was rewarded with a decent bowl. My wife didn't like the gravy but I thought it was fine. The cheese were proper curds, not the shredded garbage you find in Toronto.The desserts looked delectable and so I had a mini cheesecake, a perfect size to get a taste without over filling. The kids split a warm cookie, which came with a vanilla ice cream. The warm cookie didn't disappoint, and went perfectly with the ice cream.On top of great food and great service was a friendly,  fun vibe. It made an impression on our son, who lived his pizza and kept talking about coming back for another visit."

It was late in lunch hour and was pretty crowded, but we were seated within 10 minutes. It's a nice enough place with a nostalgic deli/diner feel. Very narrow though. Our server was nice. The wait was tough with the kids; the kitchen was pretty backed up with the crowd. Eventually, the food did come. The kids enjoyed their chicken (smaller portion than I anticipated but it worked) and burger. I had a smoked meat Reuben. And holy cow, was that a lot of meat. It was a double decker. I was stuffed by the end, but the server asked if I didn't like it since there was so much left over. Do people normally finish this thing? It was a great meal, and crowdedness aside, it was an inviting diner and I totally understand the appeal. If I came back to town, I'd beeline for this place again."

No problem biting into that sandwich, meat and all. How disappointing. Still, what little there was of it was good, as were the fries, cole slaw and  dill pickle.

As we wanted to have desert, we were advised very well and even told which ones come frozen and which are freshly made (the first time I experienced this, left me stunned and slightly incredulous it actually happened).

Granted being from New York we are quite spoiled with excellent flavors but at least we have something to compare Canadian smoked meat to. The Poutin was also average. The best part of dinner was dessert .... We got carrot cheesecake and it was done just right. The place is open 24 hours 7 days a week so after a drunken night Dunn's would most certainly satisfy the cravings, for a sober meal there are much better places."

We stayed at the Hilton Bonaventure, so it was only about a  8 minute walk.While it was pretty jammed for 8 p.m. on a Friday night, they managed to sit us in 5 minutes, which is great if you have kids that are hungry.While the Cesear salad arrive quickly, our dinners probably took at least 10 more minutes after we finished the salad. The salad was average, but I did find it odd that they used that weird fake bacon. I mean, isn't this a meat-lovers haven?The super sized sandwich is BIG. I could barely find the bread to hold the thing together. The taste was pretty good, but I found it a slight bit drier than other places. The coleslaw was a disappointment, which for me is really important. Hardly any taste at all.The kids were happy enough with their hot dog and spaghetti. Overall, a pretty safe bet for a family with kids if you can't find better options."

I should qualify this by saying that while I've eaten a lot of poutine in my day, I'd hesitate to call myself an ""aficionado"" in the realm of fries topped with gravy and cheese.That said, this was damn good. The kind of good where you take one bite and immediately realize how amazing it is. You chew franticly and swallow so you can tell the person across from you what they already - this is the best poutine you've ever had in your life.It's a kitschy little place with table top illustrations featuring video games and sports. They've got waiters who wear golf shirts with the restaurant's logo and serve their beverages in those classic fogged plastic cups. And I wouldn't change that for anything. The atmosphere is definitely a huge part of the experience.With my poutine I had a serving of smoked meat with slaw and a pickle and can attest to the fact that the portions are big (and perfect). It might be a lot for an average eater, but if you're big on quantity, this is the place.Oh and lastly, the food came within 5 minutes of ordering - I'm not exaggerating even a little about that. I'll let you decide whether that's a pro or a con.So to recap - fun atmosphere, fast service, delicious food and poutine you'd kill for."

I looked at the menu and i was instantly drawn to the smoked meat sandwich and the reuben sandwich. After all the contemplation I sealed the deal with the Reuben sandwich which had pumpernickel bread loaded with smoked meat and sauerkraut, coleslaw with a pickle, and a beautiful poutine. I found the food very delicious, the smoked meat was amazing with the sauerkraut. A great blend with the pumpernickel. The only reason it didnt reach the 5 star mark is because I already tried a poutine from La Belle Province and concluded that Dunn's poutine was inferior to La Belle's. Overall a great diner and dinner. I would definitely recommend this place, especially since I hear that its open 24/7."

I'll split this review in ""FOOD"" and ""SERVICE"" so it'll make more sense. FOOD: FIVE SHINY STARSI was going to have something like a salad, but, it's a deli, right? Let's ask for their deli plate. For 12 bucks you'll eat until you'll explode (and I shared the plate with husband) and I had the most awesome cole slaw of my entire existence. The platter also includes cornichons, peppers, sausages, green tomatoes, bell peppers, bread, I'd say it's big enough for three. SERVICE: ONE FADING STAR, AND I'M BEING AWESOMEThe service simply doesn't exist. I don't know why I had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, as the place was EMPTY and there were at least three waiters working on something (cleaning? cashier?)  CONCLUSION: (5+1)/2=3 OK Stars.

Fries were great though (hot, fresh, and ample amounts). The coleslaw and pickle were good (nothing special). Portion wise, I was expecting a bit more smoked meat.Service was a bit slow at times (long wait to get seated and ordering, but quick for the food and bill). The bathroom is a disaster (couldn't even find soap), and the decor is getting old (tape over couches, and a layer of dirt and grime on the tables.Overall, if you're looking for a place to get smoked meat (or any food for that matter; the menu is huge) in the middle of the night (after a night out; this place is opened 24 hours), this is not a bad option. If you are looking for good quality smoked meat, this is not your place. In fact, try the Dunn's in the west island. I found that one has better smoked meat and better service all together."
