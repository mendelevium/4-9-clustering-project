I legitimately think I've eaten here literally 50 timesA hole in the wall run by a cute Korean couple, Picks is build a burger heaven. Take endless combinations and make whatever you want. I always take the double but pro tip, you can also order the steak burger and add an extra patty to that as well.  The burgers are fresh, juicy (most of the time), and filling, not to mention cheap.Then there's the kogo which is basically a (beef) pogo wrapped in potato batter. It tastes exactly like it sounds. It's good.They also have wraps which are also very good. I haven't tried the beef one but the spicy chicken is a good bet. Did I mention it's also super cheap?The fries are pretty standard frozen fries, but they do the job as a side. Onion rings are also pretty decent.Barely any seating inside, I always do delivery"
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located near Concordia, this is a small burger joint ran which seems to be family run by Koreans. Inside the restaurant, there are about 3 tables, which seats 2 people each. Went there at dinner time and there was lots of traffic. They also offer Foodora and UberEats. The way you order the food there is that you take a small order sheet and pick your order yourself and any add-ons that you'd like on your burger.I ordered their burger, with 2 patties, egg, sauteed mushrooms and aioli sauce. The burger came up so massive, I had difficulty taking a bite of it. Taste-wise, it is what you expect from a decent burger. Service was kinda slow but within a reasonable time. Bottomline, decent place for burger for a decent price!"

The staff is the sweetest, the food is probably the best burgers I've ever had and I always leave with a smile on my face. Fresh, tasty food, great service, love to leave a little doodle on my way out, it just feels like a home-y place that a whole community has contributed to leave art at. If you're looking for a place that's not too expensive, and you want a place that only local will know, this is it."
/user_details?userid=41XG-tkYXv7uHubdPgetJQ,Andrew N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Looks can be incredibly deceiving and that's how I felt when I walked into Picks! I was recommended to try out this place from my friends who go to school here and boy was I not disappointed. Here's my rundown:Food --Spicy Chicken Wrap - This wrap came with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, chipotle mayo and honey mustard on top of the chicken. I can understand how this place would be a popular destination after drinking because this food is the epitome of drunk food - messy (finger licking good), savoury, and filling. The chicken melted in your mouth as it was so tender and the wrap was warmed to perfection.-Kogo - This was a game-changer. My friend pitched this idea to me and honestly, I wasn't sold on the idea as it seemed pretty weird and didn't look appetizing. The kogo is their play on the classic pogo - a deep fried all beef sausage on a stick which is battered in dough and covered with these potato chunks. It also comes with dipping sauce on the side. This was probably the best fast food dish I've ever had and I wanted more of it. The dipping sauce was chipotle mayo and you had to dip the kogo in the sauce to experience how good of a pairing these two made. Atmosphere -A small place that has one table for eating. This is more of a grab and go place and is pretty typical of your small fast food joint.Service -I feel like this place is family operated as it was run by what looked like a husband and wife duo. They were really friendly, respectful and took the time to explain their dishes to us as we were pretty unfamiliar with the dishes. Price -The wrap was about $5.00 and the kogo was $4.50. Pretty good for fast drunk food and I can see the appeal for this place.Verdict -This place is the perfect conclusion to a night out of drinking on the weekend. The service is pretty fast and if you were to try anything, try the Kogo NOW! I've seen mixed reviews on here but my experience with the kogo was amazing and is something that I would continuously get if I was a local in the area and that's saying a lot because I'm not much of a fan of regular corn dog pogos."

Customized burgers that aren't too heavy in the pockets? This is your spot. If you like burgers, this is still your spot! Picks is tiny, I almost felt claustrophobic and it was just me, my husband and the cooks at the restaurant. There are variety of options to chose from, they also give their best picks (pun intended!) We ordered a picks special burger each and then guiltily ordered a third single beef patty burger to share. I love how quick the cooks are, and they were nice enough to patiently listen to me during my indecisive rant about meats. I'm eagerly waiting for the day someone says the magical words 'let's grab dinner from picks'. The burgers are basic, packed with all the essentials and I would like to think love. I go here often and highly recommend this place to everyone. If you happen to stop by and see a girl who just can't decide on which burger to get- make sure you do say hello (spoilt by choice)"

Their burgers and k-tacos are both delicious and prepared with great care by the lovely owners of the restaurant. The sauce on the k-tacos is quite tasty and the meat always tastes well-seasoned. Definitely recommend Pick's for an affordable and mouthwatering burger to anyone visiting or living in Montreal. Great job Pick's!

The Korean couple that work there are so cute and the customizable burgers is a very nice concept. They have fried eggs and kimchi as toppings options!! The price is also very fair for the quality of the burgers - nice meat, nice bun, fresh toppings.

The only thing is that the seating area is very small so during peak hours expect to have it to go. (You can the burgers delivered too!!)"

A cute family owned business- decorated with a wall of coloured index cards on one side. You order and create your own burger with different toppings at a fair cost/ including toppings like Kimchi and wasabi mayo! I also ordered a Korean pogo- kogo, that resembled a culinary souvenir. With a drink, my meal was around $12. More of a take out place."
/user_details?userid=xnsdh6cnfmaP9hxada3jLQ,Elodie T.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"My sister and I had just arrived to our hotel and were looking for a quick dinner before we turned in for the night. After a walk through the nearby blocks of Rue St. Catherine, we ended up at Picks. Picks is just around the corner from Rue St. Catherine and a small family-owned restaurant. There were only a few tables but my sister and I managed to snag one for ourselves. Ordering was a little confusing- there were these little sheets of paper where we could customize our burgers, but the sheet of paper didn't include all of the other menu items. To keep it simple, my sister and I ordered a burger each and added on a poutine as a side. Burgers were good, although I thought it was a bit dry. Thankfully, I added kimchi so it added moisture and flavor. My sister liked hers. The standout was definitely the poutine! Now that our Montreal/Quebec City vacation is done, I've asked my sister which poutine she liked best and she picked Picks'!3.5, but since my sister really liked their poutine, rounded up to 4."

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Very small shop, with decent burgers I guess, although I don't see how it calls itself specialty burger. What I ordered: - Double patties- egg, bacon, grilled red peppers, smoked gouda, fried onion rings.Breakdown:Due to its size, I had to eat it with a fork and knife, as even half that pile of food wouldn't fit in my mouth. I took out a patty for the taste test. The patty was cooked well done (they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked) which means it was dry. In terms of seasoning, it tasted better than most patty I found in Montreal, but it's not amazing either, it can use some additional flavoring.  The grilled pepper was grilled inconsistently. One was charred (turned black) and the other was barely grilled. The slice of smoked gouda was a shame. It was cut so thinly you wouldn't taste it at all, even when you eat it individually. Not worth the 87¢ or whatever it was.As for the egg... it was cooked 'over hard'. The yolk was solid and tasteless in general. Eggs are supposed to be cooked 'over medium' at most, else the flavor is gone. As a matter of fact, a runny yolk would even have compensated for the dried out patty. Also, don't take the fried onion rings, they were greasy as hell and funnily didn't taste much like onions. -----KOGOS:It's actually just a corn dog with chunks of fried potato coating the usual batter (coating), definitely not something I would take again. You can imagine the taste: bland over bland. The extra potato did not provide extra flavor, it only diluted the bit of flavor of the sausage. The chipotle mayo that came with the kogo was not good. It wasn't chipotle smokey. It was just mayonnaise and some kind of hot sauce. -----The food was overall disappointing, mainly because I had high expectations when I walked through the door. Objectively speaking, I can see why people like these burgers. There aren't many burgers that would make the 5/10 mark in Montreal.From the food I got, I think it's pretty clear the chef and cooks in Picks haven't undergone culinary training, at least in american cuisine."

They make awesome burgers and you can just keep adding and adding things to it (at a surcharge). They also make great fries which is always a deal breaker for me. I don't know what people are talking about when they say the burgers are too salty-- I think it's the perfect amount of salt for a greasy burger joint. Would 100% recommend!
/user_details?userid=swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w,Meng Z.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Friendly little fast food shop tucked in off St-Catherines serving fast food with a korean flair. A friendly korean couple owns the place (its rare to see home-made fast food nowadays). They are most known for their Kogo (french fries covered Pogo) and their customizable burgers (get kimchi, a korean fermented vegetable - often cabbage, it adds a nice tang to your burger). The Kogo is a bit too salty and way too oily to my liking: I have trouble eating the whole thing due to how oily it is. The burgers on the other hand are quite delicious and cheap."

Now the food: (I have to preface this by saying I'm a bit of a burger snob and haven't found a burger that I've really liked outside of the states ever) the burger meat was over seasoned and well done. I liked the fries, they were crispy, and not overcooked.

I saw that it had a pretty good rating on Yelp so I figured I'd give it a shot. I went with my girlfriend and when we both walked in we noticed the place was really small and a little unclean but nothing that bad. We both ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries. The price was decent and the burgers looked pretty big. Upon both of our first bites we looked at each other and both agreed that this was one of the best burgers we had eaten so far. It was so delicious and the burger was firm and didn't fall apart yet it was also juicy. I'd give this a 5 star review for the burger although the fries were really basic and seemed like just normal frozen fries they bought and then fried up to serve. Overall a great meal but don't expect much from the fries or the ambiance, though the burger makes up for it tenfold."
/user_details?userid=Zr-aidf7LcexgYsAlKxhzQ,Yasmin S.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"This is one of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat in montreal. The burgers are fairly priced, and the list of toppings puts this place above their competitors (like buns around the corner). You can chose from a beef burger, grilled chicken or steak. Personally, I am a huge fan of the chicken burger since i find it hard to find chicken burgers that aren't deep fried and that aren't super expensive. I usually get provolone, mushrooms and wasabi mayo on top. The fries and onion rings aren't anything special, but they go great with the meal. If you are on the more adventurous side, I would suggest ordering the salad. The dressing almost tastes like a creamy ponzu sauce, and is super delicious. I've tried the kogos too. They're cheaper than ordering a burger and you get a free dipping sauce. The kogos are like corndogs but the batter has little pieces of potato in them. Very yummy. You can get a variety of sodas and juices to go with your meal. If i get a burger, side and a drink it comes up to about $9-$10. I definitely recommend this place!"

Rather, you will get a patty that does not interfere with the toppings that you chose to grace upon your burger. This, actually, is a good thing, and I'll tell you why.The lettuce, kimchi, and wasabi mayonnaise burger that I ordered not once relinquished a single drop to the plate. Nope, every last nose-hair singeing molecule of wasabi stayed on station and every drop of pungent kimchi juice assaulted my mouth and lips.My face was on fire from the delicious double whammy of spices yet I continued to smile like the Buddha.

/user_details?userid=T3QwJTaIubfrebfRrZE_Wg,Charles G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So this place has me a little bit confused. On the one hand, I really want to say that I'm rating it on the burgers which are pretty decent, on the other hand, they have a specialty called a Kogo which is just AWESOME!Okay, so the 3* rating on top is for the burger, so I'll get into that:The burger is bought as a basic with nothing on it. Then you begin picking and choosing all from the vegetables and different, sometimes exotic, sauces to put on the burger.The list of add-ons can range from the basic ""cheddar, pickle, ketchup"" to ""brie, caramelized onions, wasabi mayonnaise"". Yeah. It's cool. The meat is where I felt a slight short coming though. I think there's some kind of herb in it, maybe like parsley that makes it taste a little bit like the Arabic grill meat ""Kafta"". It's a decent burger though. If I was hungry and it was there, I wouldn't think twice about ordering it. Of course, though, the add-ons could become expensive. The brie goes for $2.00 and the caramelized onions go for $1.50. On top of a $5.00 burger that isn't too big, we're talking possibly $10 for a not so big burger. Still, it's fun to try these random things on your patty of meat.The Kogo though, I would rate 5*. What's a Kogo? A Korean Pogo. It's basically a corn dog whose batter was mixed in with chopped potato cubes and the deep-fried to make one hell of a heart-busting snack. It's heavy, greasy, and combined with their amazing spicy mayonnaise sauce it makes it a gorgeous, artery clogging snack. If that's not your cup of tea though, then don't bother. I LOVE it! Okay maybe I exaggerated a little. It is quite heavy but the reason I explained it like that cause on my first time, I went ahead and got 3 of them. It was hell and walking back home, I felt my heart cursing me.Anyway, the rating I gave was based on their burgers, so if that's what you're here for, look at the paragraph on the burgers."

You pick a sauce to dip it in. It's definitely comfort food. They lose one star for speed of service and lack of tables. It would be really great if they could have more than one table and three stools. I guess the speed accounts for the size as there is usually only one or two people there at once.Worth the wait, and the cost of extra toppings."

What makes this place is the add-ons - I had the wasabi mayo and dried tomato sauces, the former which gave the burger an incredibly unique flavor. I opted out of cheese, but I think brie or gouda would have been really interesting. Creative and delicious."
