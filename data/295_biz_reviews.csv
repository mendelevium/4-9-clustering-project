/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just ordered Lloydie's for the first time last night after looking through the different Caribbean options on Uber Eats and wow, I was super impressed! The jerk pork was everything I would want. Super tender, super tasty, huge portion and for only $15 it came with a large portion of rice/beans, a full side coleslaw salad and a couple pieces of plantains. The oxtail was the same setup (came with rice, beans, salad, plantains) and was also very tender and tasty. A bit more difficult to eat just because of the bones, but it was worth it! If I had to pick one I'd pick the jerk pork, but I hope I never have to pick one. We also get a side of the ""macaroni pie,"" which was baked macaroni and cheese and very good! Super cheesy. Spicy beef patty was also great, much better than the frozen ones (which isn't to say I don't love the frozen ones too.) Very fast delivery service - it was delivered to my place near Place des Arts within 20 minutes of ordering. Loved it and I'm already looking forward to ordering from there again."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot. The food is consistent, delicious and always hot. I got the jerk chicken for take-out and the service was great. The staff were friendly and answered any questions I had. Upon ordering, however, I noticed that they slightly increased their prices (likely due to COVID, increased cleanliness and protection equipment) but nothing too crazy.As for the food, it is full of flavour. The chicken is delicious, although I would prefer the breast. I find that the leg isn't filling enough. The rice and beans are amazing and the plantains are even better. They are the sweet type and I wish they could give so many more pieces. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. Can't wait to come back here!"
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not much of a Caribbean eater but the food here is top notch. I really enjoy their jerk chicken and also their plantain poutine. It's really worth stopping by here. The plantains are cooked to a perfect level, velvety.It's a very small place, and if you come for lunch during the weekday you will be fighting to get a seat because Ubisoft is right at the corner and everyone goes there. But, if you're passing by, it's worth the wait or get it to go.They also have sauces and little containers for you to take with you. When I went there was a spicy red sauce, a sweet orange one, and an interesting maroon sauce that tasted kind of like a combination. I suggest trying all 3!I've also been told that the oxtail is phenomenal too."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This review is for both locations, St-Viateur and Crescent.O.M.G.When I was in highschool, we had the best spicy beef patties and ever since then, nothing have come close. And Lloydie's patties, I am almost sure now are the same ones we had in school (because apparently they used to deliver to highschools in MTL)Wednesday, I realized by accident that a restaurant was in the Mile-End so my friend and I immediately came in to get patties. I went from getting one to 2. She did the same. An hour later we came back because she wanted more. I was told that they have opened the one on Crescent so the next day, Thursday, I brought a few more friends and had a sit-down lunch.I LOVE how both restos are decorated. You can immediately feel the good vibe when you walk in. The staff is so nice, friendly and attentive. Most of us took the jerk plates and everything was delicious. I even had leftover for lunch today, Friday. 3 days in a row and I'm not even mad.I would definitely come back here. Go!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Dropped in to grab a quick lunch as I happened to be in the neighbourhood for a meeting. The menu is simple and condensed; I decided to grab a sandwich as the spot was full so seating wasn't an option. I went with the spicy (thanks for asking) jerk chicken sandwich; jerk chicken, rice, pickles, and a squirt of the sauce. When they say spicy, they mean it, which is great if you like it hot like me! The chicken was tender, the bread was soft, and the sandwich burst with flavour. The service was relatively quick seeing that it was right on lunch hour too. Great spot if you're looking for something fast and delicious."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"So happy to have a new Caribbean place near me with delicious vegetarian options! We shared the vegetarian plate, the mac and cheese and the veggie patty. All was delish but the veggie plate was the best, we agreed we'd be back often for this filling dish, it's so awesome to get a big pile of food with proteins and starches and spices and full flavour that's veg, so many places can't seem to manage this. The beans and rice were sooo good, the plantains were perfect for my taste, sweet and crispy and not soaked in grease, and still hefty and filling. And the salad that came with it all included these lightly pickled cucumbers that were the perfect balance to the rest. We tried the jerk and the red hot sauces since our gentlemanly waiter gave us a thorough introduction, we like hot sauce and can handle spicy but all the sauces here are made with scotch bonnets, so even the 'mild' red sauce is pretty intense. Loved it. The veg patty is actually vegan which is so rare, a great snack to go if you're in the area. And the mac and cheese was highly decadent, a little rich for me but excellent when cut with the red sauce. All in all we ate super well for $18 and loved the warm and chill, well-decorated ambiance. Also huge appreciation for the bio-degradable containers. There are so many shitty things opening in this beloved area, it's nice to see someone come in with something cool and friendly and thoughtful, and at a price point suited to the locals. Wish them everything good."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was so good! My first Caribbean food experience and I am very satisfied. I got the chicken plate and I am very satisfied with every part of it. The rice was surprisingly flavorful and had so many added touches rather than just being plain rice. The side coleslaw was delightful with what seemed to be coconut flavor that added so much depth and creaminess that balanced the slaw dressing, and was one one of the best coleslaws I've had. The fried plantains were a really nice touch, though I felt maybe they could have been a bit crispier. The chicken was the star of the dish, and was crispy, amazingly seasoned with the right amount of spice, and amazingly tender. A great find!"

Sauces are delicious, the jerk pork is excellent, the macaroni pie is amazing.Ask for the secret sauce if you like hot and spicy. Staff is cool and polite. Plus,  mthe service is fast. I am definetly coming back."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Caribbean food 5 minutes away from my house. Great idea! They have macaroni pie.... MACARONI PIE! It's basically macaroni and cheese but they make it in this pot so it's like upwards macaroni. It keeps its shape. It's delicious. Finally, a place I can get macaroni and cheese for 4$ and in less than 4 minutes.They also have their own Montréal made soda!  hibiscus , bark, and ginger flavoured. I got to sample them but I'm really not a soda person. They aren't fizzy and the hibiscus one is really sweet!I tried their jerk fries(4$) and their chicken patty. I really enjoyed both. The spices in their jerk sauce is just spicy enough that I can tolerate it( meaning I taste how spicy it is but I can still discern flavour). Their chicken patty is so goooooood. I had yet to find a good chicken patty and they made the perfect one. A bit on the pricier side than most other patty's out there(3$), but worth it! Prices on the menu include tax. The place is really small so be prepared to get your order to go unless there's no one there. It's really nicely decorated! They have these cute stools, some books you can browse, a neon fish thing, and a section in the far back of the restaurant where you can sit with a buddy and talk to the cooks. Oh and they also have a small section where you can eat standing up(I love eating standing up)The staff is also so nice!!!! I can't wait to explore their menu this week!"
/user_details?userid=W_CkghBYSgJIJYi44GBTPA,HanDan W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I had Lloydie's on my bucket list for a while. Just tried their food recently with take-out for a team lunch. I would say that the jerk chicken is ok more like fast food version of it, but their beef patty is really good and I enjoyed the seasoning. I also tried their Ginger beer, I would say this traditional jamaican drink is too strong for my taste. I think IGA also carries it in a retailer version, would try theirs."
/user_details?userid=brnwPXpj3oJCiaEi1gPYxg,Amy D.,"North Saanich, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place!! Been twice in the past week. It's just as fast as fast food, but tastes a million times better. I get the jerk pork platter with rice- it's so good. A little spicy, but not over the top. Not pricey! Awesome and friendly service. Will come back often :)"
/user_details?userid=M5zKbubjXGu6IPST6F-MfA,Justin M.,"Centretown, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"The first thing that pops out is the decor, nice and colourful, great graphic design on the menu sign. These things please me.I'm slightly ashamed at how many times I've eaten the jerk chicken poutine but that must mean it's good. For my money, it's one of the best poutines in the city (since Chef Guru closed down, I miss that curry poutine) with some unique flavours you won't find anywhere else. Add some of their hot sauce and ohhh boy you're in flavour town."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located right in the middle of the very hipster Mile-End area on St-Viateur street, this place aims to serve great Caribbean food. Being kinda not dressed like the crowd of the area, I felt kinda out of place, but that doesn't matter.Went there on a weekday evening with a friend for dinner. Curious from their offerings and having never tasted Carribean food before in my life, I was more than curious.The decor inside was nice and the vibe from the employees was great as well. Going inside the restaurant, you will make your order then move along to collect your order. The seating area is fairly scant, with about enough seats for a dozen people (although most of the customers seemed to be locals coming for take-out). I decided to go for their plate of jerk chicken. It cost about 15$ (iirc) and came with a side of fries, rice, cucumber salad, and fried plantains. I started with the cucumber salad, which was not so great, unfortunately. It was way too acid to my taste. The main plate itself, however, was good. The spices of the chicken were well mixed, with enough taste. Unfortunately, considering my low tolerance for spices, I had some difficulty (my problem). The sides also were good, with the fries well seasoned too. Bottomline, nice place for lunch or dinner. Would recommend if you are craving chicken but want it done differently!"
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went here 10 days after it opened for lunch. The place was packed, and yet, the staff managed it well! There is a place to stand up and eat, or a booth. You may want to plan to take to go if you are going at peek hours. Extremely affordable! All portions are large! To try!In the first few days of opening they have let people sample their coconut loaf and their juices, and they are great! I really enjoyed the hibiscus flavor. They have a ton of fun spicy sauces for you to try out as well. Sauces available for purchase, could even be a fun present!The shop is super well designed! Between my colleagues and I, we have now tried everything on the menu! Our favs included:-veggie plate-jerk chicken sandwich (okay to get spicy, it isn't thattttt spicy ;) ) (messy!!)-poutine (their fries are off the hook!!!!) -chicken patty-macaroni and cheese pie (duh!) at $4 this is a steal!!-cucumber salad to cool it all off!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When the weather starts to get cold around here, most of us start to think about warming climate and getting away from the snow. I, on the other hand, think more about cuisine from those warmer climate. My regular weekly errands bring me up to Mile End and right by a relatively new spot in the neighbourhood - Lloydie's. Lloydie's has been around as a producer of Caribbean food in Montreal since 1987 but has only recently opened up a couple of fast food-like restaurants to serve their cuisine. I took the opportunity a few times to try them out and see if they could evoke some warm feelings in the midst of the cold creeping up on us.The menu is short and concise. They have jerk chicken, jerk pork and oxtail served in a few different ways (plate, sandwich or poutine) and with a variety of sides as well. It is fast food so you order at the counter, take it and go. In both cases when I visited the service was quick and very efficient. I tried their ginger beer on my first visit. Super strong ginger flavour - this isn't one of those ""sorta"" ginger drink where you taste it a bit. It is all ginger, all the time. I enjoyed it as a nice palate cleanser during the meal but it will definitely be an acquired taste for many.First up, I went with the jerk pork poutine. A nice generous portion of fries topped with a gravy, cheese curds and some jerk pork. The fries had a nice cut to them and just a little crunch on the outside. The gravy was light but flavourful and the cheese curds were the right kind of squeak - as one would want in a poutine. The key distinguishing feature here is the pork. The pork was very tender and had tons of flavour - not too spicy but with just enough kick to tell you it's there. Very enjoyable.I also decided to order a side of plantains that first time. The plantains are fried up and tossed with a spicy seasoning mix. I loved the flavour of the plantains but personally thought they were a little too thick sizewise. As a result, they lacked the more crunch I love with my favorite fried plantains.The following visit I went for a plate of oxtail. The plate is served with a side of plantains and either rice or fries - as you wish. The fries are tossed in the same seasoning as the plantains which adds a nice taste to them. The oxtail was wonderful - fall off the bone tender and very flavourful. The stewing liquid/gravy is rich and very deep in flavour. It has a certain sweetness to it - almost chocolatey in nature. Super flavourful meats, nice depth of flavours and solid portions - Lloydie's definitely goes a good job of bringing Caribbean food in a fast food approach. If you want to be the cold, definitely head over to them for a hit of Caribbean heat.Cheers!"

The Mac n cheese pie was decent.  We had to add a little more salt and pepper to it.   The jerk chicken, rice and peas were good.  Remember it's not Jamaica folks but it's will satisfy your craze.   And the staff is great.   I'll definitely be back next time I visit him."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved this place ! Stumbled upon it by chance while searching for some lunch and I'm very happy I did. They serve up Caribbean cuisine , the menu is simple and the location is no frills , super casual but very bright and clean and service was friendly and fast ! The prices were also very cheap for the quality and generous portion that you get. there is space to sit and eat there but I noticed most people (myself included) did take out. We tried their spicy beef Jamaican patty (the dough was very nice flaky and buttery and the beef was spicy and tasty inside). I had the oxtail sandwich super simple (oxtail , bread and cucumber) but soooo good! The bread was fresh,  the oxtail melted in my mouth and had Great flavour -slightly sweet but not too sweet. (They also have the option to make it spicy !!) the sandwich was so big and filling , they were very generous with the amount of oxtail inside. it really hit the spot and was some seriously satisfying comfort food. If you're a fan of Caribbean food and are looking for a quick ,delicious ,satisfying , casual bite to eat that won't break the bank, you can't go wrong with this place !"

Immediately! Really tasty. Great compliment to the plantains, rice-n-peas and mango salad. And lots of ginger in the ginger beer - just like I like it."

Aside from the friendly service there food really packs a punch, we took a few Jamaican patties, a jerk chicken poutine and a jerk chicken sandwich to share.The patties were warm and flaky and the filling was some flavourful beef with a hint of spice, I would have liked it more spicy. The jerk poutine was phenomenal, perfect balance of spice from the jerk blend compliments the delicious gravy and fries. The jerk chicken sandwich was also good, I particularly enjoyed the bread they used, it must have been a corn bread, it was delicious. I would definitely go back and try there other specialties like oxtail and there deserts! Give this place a try, support some of the best jerk in the city!"

/user_details?userid=4-JSWujuRW7FDkY8Rg8FhA,Lucinda F.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"As much as I liked it. I was a little disappointed in the amount of meat I had in my plate. I got the ox tail stew. Which was tasty... a little too sweet for my palet but I could see why people like it. But the amount of meat was ridiculous. For 18$ I had about 5 pieces of ox tail. Let's just understand this here, ox tail doesn't cost much. And putting 5 pieces in a 18$ plate, you get a lot of margins.Service was a little slow, and I didn't came late and the place was empty. I don't know how they manage. Otherwise, I was really pleased with their hot sauce. Really good. Good points on that. So my overall experience. My plate was filling because I had a lot of rice. The amount of meat is ridiculous and the service is slow. But, it was really flavourful and i will try something else next time. Because maybe it was just the oxtail plate the problem. So I'm giving them 3/5 for this reason."

I think a ten year-old could cook better jerk pork.  I also tried the in-house produced ginger beer, which tasted like something you have to drink before you have a CAT scan in the hospital. BUT! What really bugged me was that as two people eating in, we were given two paper takeout containers, plastic utensils and a side salad served in plastic cup. After we were done the employee took what was left and jammed all the plastic into the garbage. No recycling. Note to owner: look up single use plastics."

Their fries are crispy fresh, the plantain adds a delightful sweetness and the hot sauce elevates the experience to a whole new level. And if you appreciate spice as much as I do, you can also walk away with any of the three hot sauces, which are beautifully packaged."

I had remembered seeing Lloydie's and we decided to see if they had Jamaican patties--and they did!  We shared two patties, one beef and one chicken, as well as a sorrel drink.

/user_details?userid=-xXZq7Lf7_OGahqe33iq2A,L ..,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've lived in the area my entire life and the only jerk spot around has always been Caraïbe Delite on Parc. So when news hit that a new jerk restaurant would be opening up in the area, my family and I were very excited.I finally had the time to go one weekend, and the co-owner served me at the counter - really sweet, enthusiastic guy. I was told that they made a lot of their product in house including traditional beverages. Samples offered and taken. My expectations were high because of this.If I hadn't had time to people watch while my plate was being prepared, I wouldn't have realized that you need to choose a sauce to go with your chicken. I figured, maybe I'm just accustomed to super saucy, Guyanese style jerk à la Caraïbe Delite?  I also took a jamaican pattie to go, and ate it on my walk home. One bite in and I was unimpressed, because not only did it smell freezer burnt, but it was actually burnt on the bottom side.  I still had hopes that the plates I purchased would be tasty, though. When I got home, the food had cooled down a bit, and before plating it to reheat, I took a bite to see if it needed salt. My initial realization was had I not taken any side sauces, I honestly would have been left with a few over priced, under seasoned roasted chicken legs, because the rice in my plates was old. Sour smelling - the rice had gone rancid. Not acceptable to serve that to customers. And finally, my experience with the macaroni pie was also underwhelming; just a congealed square of macaroni with little to no seasoning. Glad I only brought home 1 piece. I must note, that this experience was early on, about a month after they opened. Does that make a difference? I'm unsure."
