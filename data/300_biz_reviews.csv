/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good food and good service. I got the set menu with the soup of the day, the atlantique benedict eggs and their dessert. The soup was creamy and flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the marinated onions on top was a nice match with the smoked salmon. The salmon wasn't too salty and the potatoes were very special. I didn't really like the little desssert that came with it. The service was great and we got our food quickly. The place is nice and cozy but very small. It's located in a quiet corner of the plateau, with a walkable distance from the metro."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decided to drop in for brunch with friends one Sunday following a friend's glowing reviews of this place, and boy, was I glad I listened! Firstly the portions are huge, especially if you go for the table d'hôte option. Secondly, the food is delicious! I loved my tartiflette; heavy on the cheese and potatoes just like I like it! I also ordered a portion of their beignets just cause I had too; good but a little oily for my taste. My friend gobbled her classic dish as well. Lastly, the service was great! This place gets busy and the wait can be daunting since it's so small, but we didn't have to wait too long having arrived at 11:00. Two staff table service but they were efficient and oh so friendly! Lately, the space is chill and unpretentious but not too hipster ( yes, it's in the Plateau) so yeah for that too. Will go back if in the neighborhood.."

The gaspacho is really yummy. Two of my friends had the Avocado Toast, another had the assiette rustik and I had the Bénédictine Atlantique. No complaints, we barely spoke since the food was that good.The dessert was ok. Nothing amazing.The smoothie was also pretty good.The place is pleasant and cozy. The service was good and on spot.I am certainly coming back here."
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to this place because it's next to my laundromat, and now I'm super sad to be moving away because this place is wonderful!So I only had 15 minutes to burn before my laundry was dry, but I ended up getting a teapot of Assam!Breakfast (from Camellia Sinensis) and a brownie that was SO GOOD that I actually started writing this review halfway through eating it. Sadly, the place was empty when I came in :( maybe because it's 4pm on a Wednesday. But this place is so charming, with soft cafe music (Macklemore in this case) and homemade, PERFECT desserts. Okay let's go back to that brownie thoughSoft, melty chocolate chunks, blanketed in a texture so smooth that it's hard to believe it's actually not entirely chocolate. The top has that perfect shiny finish, which makes me think they do something magic in the recipe, because I find it so hard to get it that shiny!though I didn't try the savoury food, the brunch menu looks particularly appetising- benedicts with gravlax and homemade hollandaise, and french toast made with brioche, topped with honey-roast pecans and salted caramel. Wow!I sincerely hope this place gets as busy as it deserves to be."

/user_details?userid=kS-KsfZgrAvJne9UemOe2g,Loïc T.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,I don't know what to say we waited almost 20 minutes! Food is really simple and not tasty at allWe order Benedict classic and rustick meal. The gaspacho was great but main course was cheap ingredient and it was blend.Benedict was overcook and the prosciutto chip was really saltyIn the Rustik 2 pieces of bacon really dry and a knacky sausage with can beans....About the dessert.... we didn't even touch it! Way over rated and over price. Feel like the business paid for get good review.
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cool place for brunch, very country like decor which I love by the way. I also like the fact that they serve a small bowl of soup with your brunch order and give you a small dessert at the end. The place itself is pretty small so it's not really designed for huge groups, although they do have a table that could fit about 8 people. The service is nice and it does have that welcoming atmosphere, definitely recommend to try their avocado toast or grilled cheese."
/user_details?userid=ny-v5lBVnZe5LK4nDHHKMg,Talisa K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"What a beautiful experience! We were a group of 4 women, came here on a whim after trying to get into another restaurant that had a ridiculous line, and we were seated after about 10-15 mins. We had the set menu which came with a soup, main, and small dessert (coffee was an extra $1,50). Such a smart idea and the options were amazing! I had the Classic Eggs Benedict and it was aaaaamazing. All the other options looks delicious too (the other girls had the Vege Benedict & Atlantic Benedict, and they said they were absolutely delicious). Kind of wish they had the avocado toast available (they might've but we didn't see it anywhere on the menu) as the pics of it on yelp looked fantastic. Maybe next time!Overall - amazing experience, amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing service. Merci beaucoup!!!"
/user_details?userid=6ZI7wDVLpd7lndayvMZzfQ,Elsa L.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"And off I was earlier in the day to brunch at a neighborhood spot, Le P'tit Rustik. It was quite small and quaint filled with locals. I ordered a small cup of their signature gazpacho with  homemade croutons, feta and a drizzle of olive oil (I noticed most were ordering it. So it had to be good). It was quite nice! Followed by eggs benedict with goat cheese, avocado and  candied, honey cashews. I had never had that combination. Quite delicious! They gave us a basket of complimentary potato fritters(Beignets de pommes de terre) They were wonderful!Definitely recommend this local spot but don't be in a hurry."
/user_details?userid=8QoOb0HVnju3UorkOwCHhA,Roger L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Came here with a ""large"" group of 6-8 folks (honestly I forgot). This place isn't built for a group that size, more like 4-5 tops. The server was super accommodating despite the fact, but I would not recommend coming here with that size because it did put a strain on the kitchen and service that we werent expecting to impose upon. It truly is p'tit. Most of us ordered the brunch special which was a soup, main entree, and some dessert. I have no idea what I ate as the soup or the dessert because I'm not that cultured, but it was like some cold tomato soup (still delicious) and some white fluff with raspberry as dessert (VERY delicious). I got some avocado toast despite not being a fan of avocado toast. I ended up actually enjoying it this time. So I'm sure that people that DO like avocado toast would really get something out of this. The orange juice was the bomb dot com dot gov dot org."
/user_details?userid=qTWnV4hHXmmGxMOtPGCkHw,John T K.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,Wife liked the hot chocolate and omelette that came with the little potatoe fritters. I got the grilled cheese that comes with a side salad which was ok. We didn't get the bonus dishes - no soup and brownie I read about on Yelp.
/user_details?userid=LkYXWBIupp915Tsft8xb2Q,Alice L.,"Arlington, MA",5 star rating,"I wish Le P'tit Rustik wasn't a 5 hour drive away because their food is so dang good. We came for brunch and the menu was limited. There were 4 options (avocado toast, smoked salmon eggs benedict, classic eggs benedict, English breakfast). Brunch came with a small soup, main entree, dessert. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was delicious! The plate came with eggs benedict + pickled onions, salad, fruits, and their bognettes (potato fritters). Eggs were perfectly poached and the sauce was super creamy. Never had pickled onions with eggs benedict and it was a nice touch. Portion was perfect, I was full enough that I could still finish dessert but not too stuffed.The bognettes were AMAZING, we had to put in a side order of them! Super crispy and fragrant, I could eat these all day. Service was very friendly. The decor inside was cozy. Definitely follow them on Facebook to get updates on their menu.Everyone in our party loved their food. Will definitely be back and keep up the good work!"
/user_details?userid=o6rHcSB3Z3F5PSy8YvzFqA,Sally X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stumbled across this cute little bistro because the line at L'avenue was too long (as usual), and may have found my favourite brunch place in Montreal. The brunch menu is short and simple, and every dish comes with fresh fruit, soup du jour, ""bognettes"", & dessert. Every part of the meal was amazing and the service was great. If you aren't sure what to order, can't go wrong with the classic benny. We'll def be coming back to try more of their dishes."
/user_details?userid=EbX3-cBl-gsUWtseNspSsQ,Maya S.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place to go to get that homey, small town feel, with great food. Le P'tit Rustik is an amazing brunch spot and all their food is delicious!"
/user_details?userid=kaJtFPufdn1JFmaLwYFyvg,Yulia K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"What a lovely place! So cute inside and the food is delicious - we had the potato pancakes and they were perfectly crispy and flavourful. Ingrid and Thomas, the owners, are running the place themselves, just the two of them and they are doing a wonderful job! This place gets packed for lunch/brunch so make sure you get there before the rush!"

/user_details?userid=7Z1MRM-qohHt2-WKtlq61Q,Ray S.,"Omaha, NE",5 star rating,Went in on a Thursday morning at 09:00 and was greeted by a welcoming server. Served an appetizer of fritters with sour cream and chives. We ordered one of their benedicts with salmon as well as a cheddar and ham omelette. Perfection! The atmosphere in this sleepy little neighborhood reminds you of a living room. Will visit again
/user_details?userid=rbbN4r05yZX7fcftyOUbJQ,Syam R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best restaurants I've tried in Montreal. Menu is pretty simple , and very single ingredients is top quality. Great vision, great attention to detail  great everything. Much respect to everyone involved in making it what it is."
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a fun new brunch place on the Plateau! We don't do brunch often, but I think we should.My husband and I came around 12:30 PM on a Sunday and had to wait a while to be seated. It is a small place with one large table in the center and about 5-6 smaller tables around the edge of the restaurant. We ended up sharing the large table with another group, which was totally fine!There were two specials that were each served with a cup of soup and a small dessert - plenty of food! I loved my egg dish containing a generous amount of feta. The best part was the unique specialty ""bognettes"" - basically fried potato donuts. They were very well flavoured and crispy! We had a nice chat with the owners who talked about their recent opening and the area in France where bognettes come from. Great local place!"
/user_details?userid=izabjLosXTh94TVG48aD6w,Shashank K.,"Revere, MA",5 star rating,I've selfishly used Yelp for years without ever writing a review but I have to share what a hidden gem this place is. The food was delicious and filling. I had the Bagel Gravlax and the wife had the Avocado toast and they were both a solid 10/10 (I finished her plate as it was a big toast!) The owners are sweet and polite and this is going to be a must-eat-at place for us every time we visit Montreal!
/user_details?userid=qIXmck5RBMl5G-Lz2GGgow,Sydney G.,"Sharon, MA",5 star rating,"We decided to come to Le P'tit Rustik when there was too long of a line at another place we were interested in. We walked in and were instantly greeted by the kindest host! The place itself is very cute and home-y. The brunch was a 3-course meal with this first course being this delicious sweet potato, nutmeg, ginger soup. I got the forestier eggs benedict while my boyfriend got the Rustik. Both were amazing! The forestier was this mushroom eggs Benedict with a white wine sauce - very tasty! The last course was this great almond mousse with a raspberry sauce. One of the best meals I've ever had! Important to know that the restaurant is owned by just 2 people. They make everything in house which is great but what is on the menu is all they offer. BUT they make it great! 10/10 would recommend"
/user_details?userid=pHBDrZBAS2cUiQRnyVccRg,Lauren N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Cute little place hidden on the corner of Duluth and Drolet. Food and drinks are of the great quality you expect in the Plateau. The decor is appropriately rustic with the sun shining in to give it a nice warm feel. I will miss the quieter days sitting here as I'm sure it will be getting busier as more people discover it!
/user_details?userid=ecTZnCrYbmFEV1SRbkkseg,Joe S.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"My favorite breakfast/brunch place in the city. The menu is always impeccably chosen and the food delicious. The interior is cozy and area quiet. Added touches like a daily gazpacho and innovative desert, such as almond mousse really put it heads and shoulders above any other place in the area. The cherry on top is the exceptionally friendly and considerate wait staff. They remembered my SO and I after going there two months prior."
/user_details?userid=3693PAajB4ySDtJexAk4ZA,Chris C.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is serving up some delicious beignets and brunch. Everything is quality, made with attention to detail, and locally sourced. Would 10/10 recommend."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I found this little restaurant through yelp and was very happy to have discovered it. The service was really friendly and the decor is nice too. The brunch menu is short, but their vege benedictine was a nice change to the usual. It also came with a gazpacho and dessert! I really enjoyed my meal and would be happy to return in the future!"
