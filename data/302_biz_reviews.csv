/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The experience at Gus was phenomenal from beginning to end, I am thoroughly impressed. It's been a while since I've had an experience this good. It wasn't a problem making a reservation on a rainy Monday night, but I was incredibly surprised after having eaten here that there wasn't a line out the door. This cozy restaurant, located on the corner of Saint-Dominique & Beaubien, had the perfect atmosphere: perfect lighting, the music at JUST the right volume... great first impression. The menu, written on a chalkboard, seems simple, but the waitress then came and explained every dish (roughly 10 apps and 10 mains, some not actually on the chalkboard) in complete detail. It wasn't just her descriptive memory of the menu, but she actually just seemed extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wines. Started out with the amazingly soft, chewy house bread, made with rosemary oil and clearly fresh. It. Was. So. Good. Then the oysters (raspberry point from PEI) which were perfectly shucked, and the caesar salad, not as creamy as the usual caesars (and I mean that in the best way) but light and delicious. It is also quite a large serving. Then came our Surf & Turf for 2: a 15oz rib eye with grilled scallops and shrimp. It was easily THE BEST STEAK I've had in a very, very long time. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and just the right amount of fat left on it to keep it juicy and flavourful. This was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with just the lightest touch of truffle (not overwhelming as most restaurants mistakenly throw on) and surrounded by deliciously grilled shrimp and scallops, in a sauce that coated the bottom of the plate. Every single part of this dish was perfect. Will absolutely be back!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"On the strength of the caesar and tomato salads, I bestow upon thee a 5 star rating. My wife and I were fortunate to snag a 7pm reservation in this tiny Little Italy restaurant this past Saturday night. We enjoyed a stellar meal. Our biggest problem was that we didn't get to sample everything on the menu given that our appetites had sadly reached their capacity after the first hour.I started the meal with one of their lime margaritas. This is the real deal folks. Real lime, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, and served with floating micro ice crystals from having been shaken in the mixer. It tasted like a holiday to me. Fresh doughy bread was then placed on the table alongside a couple of homemade spicy salsas and some delicious corn relish. Dipping my buttered bread in these condiments while sipping my margarita, I was one happy camper before even ordering a morsel of food off the menu.We ordered liberally, choosing the caesar salad with caviar, the tomato and burrata salad as well as the salmon tartare to start. I have to agree with the majority of reviewers that the caesar salad at Gus is one of the best you will ever enjoy. The dressing is a perfect balance of creamy, salty, and fishy (anchovies?). Hidden within the crispy leaves of romaine, you will find little pieces of treasure in the form of fried bread croutons and crispy lardons. With the added optional caviar (for an extra few dollars), this dish hits every pleasure centre in your brain at the same time. It's kind of like medication without the side effects.The same goes for the heirloom tomato salad. I don't know what they did to these tomatoes, but the result was a slightly acidic and ultra fresh concoction mixed with burrata cheese and the same delicious fried bread croutons. This simple salad is better than any other simple tomato  dish I have tasted anywhere. The salmon tartare didn't distinguish itself from other restaurants' versions, but it certainly was prepared nicely and tasted fresh. While I love avocado, this dish features it a little too prominently. Most bites contained as much if not more avocado than salmon.For our main, we succumbed to the hype of hundreds of online reviews and got the surf and turf for 2. This is essentially a large sliced cut of ribeye, about 5 large scallops and 5 decently sized shrimp, served atop pureed mashed potato in a creamy pool of sauce. The dish certainly has a wow factor in terms of presentation. With regard to taste, I would give the dish 4 stars out of five. The steak is quite tasty as are the scallops. The shrimp were average. They lacked a little size as well as a rich grilled flavour that I was hoping for. The potato puree was spread a bit too thin and was essentially drowned by the pool of sauce covering the entire platter. Despite the simplicity and opulent presentation of this dish, I cannot say this is the best example of scallops, shrimp, and steak I have ever sampled. They are prepared very well, but unlike the salads we enjoyed, I can find better versions of the surf and turf components at other establishments if I look hard enough. Granted, Gus' version of the surf and turf will beat 80% of other restaurants, so please go ahead and order this as you likely won't be disappointed. I realize that I'm setting the bar extremely high as the dish is objectively very good. That said, I would argue that it is restaurant Gus that set these high standards with some of their other dishes. For dessert, we shared a perfectly prepared tarte tatin. The apples were deeply caramelized and browned while retaining their shape and taste. The crust was thin and laced with butter. Despite being stuffed to the gills, this is the type of dessert that makes you a little sad once you take that last bite and realize that the meal is over. The chef clearly has a vision of a greatest hits menu. It reminds me of any number of classic rock albums where every song knocks you over the head without relenting. Kind of like Appetite for Destruction, Back in Black, or Nevermind. Next time, I've got to try those foie gras nachos. Next time can't come soon enough!"

I was just visiting Montreal for 3 days and stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant. Fortunately I called in same day and was able to get a reservation for 7:30pm on a Wednesday. You absolutely must try the Caesar salad! Definitely the best salad that I've ever had. From the in house dressing, to the spongey croutons, fresh lettuce and flavorful bacon. We also shared the surf and turf which was amazing as well. Some of the biggest scallops I've ever seen, fresh shrimp, and tender steak. I would recommend that everyone in Montreal should try this restaurant, I can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=0EjGazPGPCQSZCNxxVF7eA,Michael C.,"Stewartstown, PA",5 star rating,"I'm a little late writing this review, but came back to do so because they deserve it. We had an all-around amazing experience even though something caught fire in the kitchen causing the alarms to go off, which is quite unpleasant to the ears. They had to open the doors to the freezing temps to air out, then had to ""reset"" the kitchen which delayed all the orders an extra 20 minutes. Who cares?! The folks were great and the meal was delicious. Can't wait to be in Montreal again. We were two Americans and a native who hadn't been before. She said she can't wait to bring some friends back. The onion soup was the best I've had. The Caesar salad, bavette de beouf, and moules et frites were all so outstanding that we shared everything."

Came here with a small group without a reservation and we were immediately seated. I really dig the atmosphere and how it seemed like a friendly, neighborhood restaurant and that it WAS! Our waitress was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable of their extensive and exotic menu. We tried horse meat for their first time, loved it! The highlight of my meal was the Caesar salad with cavier. Its a must try-if you want to be a little fancy! Hey and you might even see Gus!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is dope! Came here for a Yelp Elite gathering 4 years ago and totally loved my experience. However, I never came back.... until today! And you know what? It was JUST AS GOOD as I remembered it!!!I'm stoked.This place is real easy to miss on this busy street given the small size of the establishment. When you walk in you realize very quickly this place is  perfect for an anniversary or intimate date(s)! Our hostess and waitresses were amazing (and beautiful?) and we were really taken of during our entire stay!!! Loved it.I went with Gus Margarita and Amaretto Sour for drinks and they were just perfect. They made great side companions as we dined happily.As an appetizer I went with their Caesar salad and honestly it was simply the *clap* best *clap* Caesar *clap* salad *clap* I *clap* ever *clap* had  *clap*!!!!! The cherry on top of this plate is the fact the dressing is made in-house as the salad is BEING prepared once you order it. It does wonders for the dish!!! They also do it the ""traditional"" way with anchovies, croutons and capers. JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.MMMMMmmmmmThis is about the closest you'll get me to become a vegetarian. In fact, if everything vegetarian tasted this good, I'd convert from my daily meat plan being a Carnivore and all.As a main I went with their ""Duo a Porc"" which is basically 2 types of porc in a hearty dish. I dig it. Suggestion though, perhaps a little variety in the dish such as some greens or potatoes would go a long way? Still good but wouldn't have it again. I did try the wife's filet mignon and the meat simply meeeeeelted in my mouth.... divine.For dessert we shared their strawberry shortcake and it was the real deal. Absolutely fantastic!!!!! We almost had a fight and broke out in shenanigans for the scraps.This place is a total 5 stars and only their price-tag impedes me from visiting this place on a regular basis. This is why I need to win the lottery. However, if a special event ever does come up, I know EXACTLY where to go.Merci."
/user_details?userid=OrYgrJcq43BYrOxuqSumBQ,Tim K.,"Charleston, SC",5 star rating,"I have waited 2 years to go back to Gus. Long story short, during a Yelp Halloween party in Montreal, I won $100 gift certificate for this restaurant. Unfortunately, I had to leave the day after. So I kept the certificate in my travel bag, in case I ever ended up in Montreal for dinner. Work finally brought me here.I and a friend decided to treat ourselves and go all out. We started with horse meat tartare which is really good and definitely a suggestion for people that have never tried horse. To accompany the horse we ordered the Ceasar Salad, with caviar. OMG!!! Maybe the best salad in my life. Not only because of the caviar but everything was so fresh and tasty. To make the whole experience complete, we went for a surf and turf. Which didn't come with lobster, but with a bunch of scallops and shrimp and an awesome thick creamy sauce.I have to admit... I was happy we had to walk down on the way back because I felt like falling down at any point. So much good food... I thought I was going to explode. The staff was amazing, friendly. The atmosphere, in general, is cozy. Like sitting in your own living room but you have David cooking you amazing food."
/user_details?userid=1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,Rob P.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,What a hilarious situation. My friend from Belgium won $100 gift card for Gus about 2 years ago and he's been traveling the world with it in case he made it back to Montreal. Last week we both ended up in Montreal at the same time and we're able to use the beat up voucher. The meal did not disappoint and the restaurant was charming along with the staff. We ordered the surf and turf for two for $79 and that alone would have been enough food for us. The scallops were great. The shrimp was great. The meat was great. A little thick on the sauce for me but my friends loved it.We also ordered the horse tartare which I wasn't crazy about and the Caesar salad with caviar on top. Now that was a delicious salad and there was such a large portion of caviar.We didn't save room for dessert but somehow we ended up with a piece of blueberry cheesecake in front of us and it was one of the best pieces of Cheesecake I've ever had. Very light and a blueberries were a special variety from Canada. Overall a fantastic dining experience. I recommend sitting at the bar and being part of the open kitchen. Thanks to all the staff at Gus for a great last night in Montreal!
/user_details?userid=EmrahJMelcioolXzG8TVng,John W.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Gus isn't a restaurant, it's an experience. The service, attention to detail, menu selection, and execution are exquisite. The best part is this is fine dining without any pretension or sense that some don't belong. If you value amazing food and great ambiance, you belong. The surf and turf is the the reason to come here. Don't leave without ordering. The steak is cooked to perfection, the scallops are plump (and I don't even like scallops), and the shrimp are incredibly flavorful. The mashed potatoes are whipped to a smoothness that you probably haven't experienced. Usually the surf and turf is solely for two people. If you're dining solo I suggest being very pleasant to your server and requesting an exception."

/user_details?userid=_PvyIrD0Mp-NswjUKv1URA,Deborah K.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"Our first (and only) visit to Gus was on my birthday. We made a reservation 24 hours in advance to be sure that we'd have a decent table.We walked in and were seated at a tiny table for 2 with an extra chair stuck on the side. Needless to say, the three of us weren't exactly comfortable in such a cramped space.The waitress came over and took our drink order first and the drinks were delivered quite quickly. She came back a while later to go through the menu with us. We really appreciated that she explained each item in detail, although we would have liked to have actual menus in our hands rather than having to look at a chalk board at the other end of the restaurant.We ordered 2 Caesar salads and one gravlax for appetizers. The kitchen was kind enough to make one Caesar without anchovies as our son has an allergy. The dressing was delicious on both salads and the gravlax was also very nice.For our main dishes, we had one tartare de cheval, one bavette de boeuf and one pork chop. The tartare was served with frites, grilled bread and a side order of grilled vegetables. It was very good, but the tartare (albeit a huge portion) could have used some acid (maybe a little mustard). The bavette de boeuf was served with a gratin of potatoes and was quite tasty. The pork chop was served with mashed potatoes (lovely and smooth and well-seasoned) and a jus with tomatillos. The dish was really well-balanced but the pork chop was overcooked without even a hint of pink.All in all, the meal was good but not a good as we had anticipated after reading reviews on Yelp. For almost $300 for three people (including drinks), we were left wanting.The staff were friendly and efficient, so there was no complaint on that front. We live far too far away to visit on a regular basis, but to be honest we probably wouldn't go back in a hurry even if we lived closer. There are just too many other more desirable options in the area."

We went there on a Monday night so it wasn't that busy.  We had the choice of sitting at the bar or table ; the opted for the bar where you can see the kitchen and the chefs cook.We started with a pickeled calamari & octopus salad ($15): delicious! For the main course, me and my friend shared the surf and turd for 2 which included a nice piece of steak, shrimps and scallops and a side of butternut squash and beats...it was perfectly cooked and flavorful ($75)We also decided to share a bottle of red wine which did compliment our meal perfectly...they have  a wide selection of private italian wine.Our total bill came to about $100 each including tip...definitely a bit pricey but worth it. If you are looking for good food in a good atmosphere for a date,  this is definitely the place to go.

The menu is small but ever changing and every ingredient is fresh. Bonus points for an open kitchen, I love these.They have lots of private import wines and beers to pick from which only adds to the cool factor of your meal, be sure to have a chat about what you like in a beer/wine and they will all make some recommendations that you won't regret. Of special note: the desserts here are fab, I personally am in love with the lemon tart nom nomAlso note: Thursday and Friday lunch is available and it is equally fantastic.

We called for a reservation day of and they only had bar seats left. I asked if the chairs had backs and they did so we went for it considering how highly it was rated on Yelp, and we are so glad we did. Our seats were at the far end of the bar, tucked into the corner almost and turned out to be perfect. We chatted with the owner, David, all night while he made each and every Caesar salad from scratch using only a fork (I think). Hands down, it was the best Caesar salad we've ever had. Everything else we had was great too -- octopus appetizer, steak, veal chop, and dessert, also made by David. Margaritas were also excellent. The vibe added to the experience. Everyone at the bar seemed to know David, and we did too pretty quickly. The place has a few tables along the wall which seemed more intimate, so there's a spot for everyone. We will be back on our next trip to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=iLjMdZi0Tm7DQxX1C1_2dg,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"If I lived in this hip area of Montreal, there's no doubt I'd be a Gus regular. Even as a temporary visitor, I felt the good natured charm that encapsulates your whole being at this French brasserie. We sat at the bar (aka, the best seats in the house) and were able to converse with Dave throughout our stay. Not only is he the Canadian doppelgänger to LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy, he's also a gentle giant with a nice dose of culinary creativity. That inventiveness extends to their cocktail program as well. Since I was there mostly as a barfly, the scale was tipped in the favor of Gus' libations.From a guy who grew up minutes from the Mexican border, let me tell you Dave makes a mean margarita. He knives through limes right in front of your face and adds a few magic touches to elevate this already refreshing elixir into something special. The same goes for the rhubarb slush (procured from the next door ice cream parlor) which he adds rum to for a nice muggy weather respite. Calamari toast acted as a refreshing palate cleanser between meals to fully embrace the flavor profiles of both drinks. All the while yukking it up with the bar and kitchen staff who are so close, you could reach out and hug them. It elicits a kind of community feel that can only be accomplished when done just right. As you might suspect, Gus cracked the code.Whether you're in Montreal, Poughkeepsie, or Tokyo, this is what a neighborhood restaurant should strive to be."

The chef is soooooo committed to his clientele and it shows at every second. He is so relaxed while he cooks that it would make anyone at ease. The staff is all quite similar too; friendly, welcoming, knowledgable and honest.Gus is comfort food at its finest. The place itself is super cute. We sat at the bar and the whole dining experience was exactly that- an experience. I felt we went through adventures, both culinary and visual while there. Almost magical. I didn't want to leave. I wanted to move in.The oysters were perfect.The squid and octopus salad was very good- especially the octopus part- I would have made it only with octopus if I had the choice...The Caesar salad had crispy pancetta chunks and bread fried in olive oil that all blended and melted in my mouth.The onglet de boeuf had layers of flavour and the portions were all huge (as opposed to many of these new ""tapas style"" restos opening these days). The scalloped potatoes on that dish were so so good I can't even come close to describing them.The lemon tart was fabulous.Homemade baguette, homemade pickled pepper and homemade roasted corn relish all come on the side as delicious accompaniments. Oh- the cocktails are fantastic too!This restaurant totally has a Joe Beef vibe to it- meat, seafood, cozy, large portions, heart. If that's what you like in a culinary experience, go to Gus and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I cannot wait to go back and I sure hope it doesn't change."

We are staying in the area for the week and found this cozy little restaurant that quickly seated our two families with 2 small children. The staff were super nice and helpful and explained each dish on the menu. Chose a few appetizers and mains and we were not disappointed. Very fresh and seasonal dishes were served. We loved the house made Caesar salad. The ceviche was very tasty as well as the mussels in a lemongrass coconut broth. Our mains were all excellent as well - seared tuna with olive tapenade on a bed of creamy pesto polenta & buttermilk marinated double boned pork chop over garlicky mash and house gravy.   Would definitely go back again.

Featured cocktails are a perfect start.

We actually love seeing chefs in action and its actually really nice to be able to sit beside your partner and chat more intimately.Our waitress did not keep us waiting one bit and went through the menu thoroughly despite how busy she already was.  Everyone really needs to themselves a favour and try their margarita.  The BEST I have had and I'm not even a margarita fan.  When the our kindest waitress attended to other patrons, we were not left hanging.  Chef David swiftly took our orders and he was nothing but friendly from start to end.Blah blah blah... I need to talk about the food!  We were served with thick fresh bread and house made corn relish (please see Kris' review of the bread, Kris tells no lies).  We then started with the fois gras nacho and grilled octopus.  Be warned, these can easily be your main if you're not a big eater.  The fois gras was unique, it really is a fois gras and not a pâté.  So that's what fois gras tastes like! It did not take me long to finish this appy and I already feel the food coma coming. The grilled octopus did not disappoint either.  It was refreshing and really opens up your appetite.  When the our lamb and steak arrived, we really weren't sure if we can finish the dishes.  The portion was generous but it is not the quantity but the quality that spoke volume about the two dishes.  The lamb was probably one of the best I have had.  It was perfectly cooked and served with a mountain of mint leaves coated in a sweet dressing.  Brilliant!  And if that doesn't fill you, there's roasted potatoes hidden underneath all the goodness.  Now let's talk steak.  We had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly with a sear on the outside.  They were juicy and tender; what made this dish even better was the sliced potatoes and sandwiched in between are mushrooms.  Wow!  It almost stole the steak's thunder on this dish!Stick a fork in us cause we were done after cleaning up these plates!  We would've loved to finish up the meal with some dessert and coffee but we were quickly falling into a food coma.  After we got the bill and ready to roll out, Chef Dave held us back to send us away with a complimentary chocolate cake to go!  By the time we got back to our hotel, we made just enough room devour the perfectly balanced chocolate cream cheese cake.  Will definitely be back on our next visit to Montreal.  If you van only choose meal in Montreal, go to Gus.  This kitchen does not disappoint and the casual dining experience will set a new standard.  And remember to ask for bar seats!"

We sat at the bar so we had kind of limited space but at the same time I can't say anything bad about the service or food. Since we didn't speak French well enough to understand the entire menu the waitress explained it to us for like 10 minutes which was highly appreciated.All in all very nice!
/user_details?userid=WeVkkF5L39888IPPlRhNpg,Kristian U.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"When you're weary from traveling you usually get extra hungry and don't event realize it. When you reach this level of hunger and fatigue the last thing I know I want to do is make food decisions. My thought is ""bring me a bit of everything and I'll figure it out"". Now that's an expensive way of thinking but when your colleague is a neighborhood regular at a place like GUS, he or she will be able to order you the best of the menu and take the painful part out of making decisions. Last night I was able to enjoy a shareable selection of several delicious plates prepared by the expert chefs at GUS. To begin we nibbled on their complimentary thick sliced bread which paired perfectly (on the recommendation of the owner) with their house made corn relish. I actually could have eaten just that the rest of the night. Sweet and cool and a perfect way to soften the thick slightly sweet bread. Our first and second menu items to arrive were a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The Caesar came as a massive portion more than enough for 3-4 of us to have more than a fair share. The dressing was freshly prepared and the croutons were huge holding their own against the dressing. The calamari was also very nice, served with some greens and done grilled as opposed to deep fried. It reminded me of Italian style antipasto calamari done in light oils and herbs.Then came the fois gras nachos. Holy hell these were RICH. The cheese, the fois, the toppings. I didn't even really care if there were chips under all that deliciousness or not - there were, but who cares! Loved this dish. I liked everything that was served to me until this point. The fatigue of the day and being a little tipsy on sparkling and flat white wines plus being a little full was all catching up to me. It was then I sort of entered into a dream like state and the main course was delivered. Surf and turf!! OMG!!! Thank goodness we were sharing this because the portion of meat, mash potatoes and seafood was insane. The well marbled and nearly fork tender steak was perfectly grilled and marinated, sat atop a bed of fluffy mashed potatoes. But that wasn't all, on top of that steak was arranged easily half a dozen large tiger shrimp and a half dozen equally large scallops. This entire dish was coated in a garlic-butter (and perhaps mustard) sauce that had me eating far beyond the realm of ""need"" and straight into the land of greed. I left fatter and happier as I imagine most patrons of GUS leave and slept better last night than I have in recent memory. Thanks to the staff for being amazing Live from Montreal - Eatcrest Out!"

We've been enjoying his food since their first restaurant - Le Jolifou - and we continue to enjoy it immensely at Gus. His food is consistently thoughtful, fresh, and delicious. Simple sounding dishes that you've heard about for years - Cesar Salad, Surf & Turf - become something new and extraordinary here. In fact, it is far and away the best Cesar Salad I've ever eaten.More than the food, the atmosphere and staff make the restaurant warm and welcoming. There's no better casual spot in Montreal to get warm, hang out, and treat yourself to some seriously good and under the radar cuisine."

The staff was really nice, I loved the fact that our waitress explained to us with so much details and clarity what was on the menu that night (as my mother is very complicated with new flavours).We took an entree - tartare de salmon gravlax, huitres, Caesar salad. Mine was delicious, very spicy with the touch of wasabi. Then I ordered the bavette with a chipotle marinade, and what can I say : it was one of the best thing I ever ate. The dessert was very original and surprisingly good (dark chocolate cake with Bailey's cream).All in all, it is quite expensive, but when you taste the quality....totally worth it !!!!"

For dessert we split a slice of chocolate cake with cream cheese and Bailey's icing. It was incredible and fresh. I would go here again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone!

It's a small restaurant, so expect close quarters, and service can be slow as there is a low number of staff for the complexity of the menu. Definitely plan for three courses for the full experience. Wonderfully cooked meats, and large enough portions for the price for mains. The margaritas are a MUST."
/user_details?userid=s8nkbQAlrVPfg1u4anGKtw,Kelly S.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Gus! The first thing I thought of, naturally, was the fat mouse in Cinderella. I knew things were going to go well after that. We arrived to a beautiful and charming restaurant and were immediately seated. Our server switched flawlessly from French to English as they seem to do so well in this part of the world and as he listed the dishes, I knew we were in trouble. Give me all the things! Thankfully, Risa was able to pick some of the best items and order for us. Their salmon tartare was incredible. Perfectly fresh and gorgeous. We also enjoyed the octopus appetizer and though that's not typically my thing, it was savory, a little smoky and not at all chewy. And accompanying all of these are three hot salsas on the table. Apparently Dave makes them. His restaurant menu is littered with nods to the southwest (chipotle, serrano) and these three little delights were no exception. At that point, I'd gotten into my second cocktail. Their margaritas, Dave assured me, were as good as any I'd get in Texas. I had my doubts but when that fierce concoction arrived, I had to raise the white flag. It was perfect. As good or better than any I had growing up near the border of Mexico. A good margarita in Montreal may be hard to find - but Dave's got it down. Our mains were the pork and the (giant) steak with seafood. We may have over-ordered but by god, we we managed to eat every last bit of those delectable dishes. Then the dessert came. Seriously, trying to kill me. Thank goodness I had on leggings-as-pants or else things would have been dicey in the old button region. Our desserts were a dense chocolate cake with creamy frosting, some kind of de-constructed caramel-y apple dessert (tarte tartine?) and a lemon tart. I'm not even a dessert person and I was elbow deep, fighting for bites. Restaurant Gus is adorable and perfect for friends, a date night or that evening when you just want a glass of wine and a good dessert. When you go here, high five Dave and the staff because they're awesome."

From the salmon tartare to the roast beef to the tarte, everything was made with care. It is one of those great places where the chef puts his heart into each dish. Everything was fresh and made with care. The ceasar salad was made fresh to order (even their pancetta is sliced to order), they home make so many of their sauces. It was my first time trying home made hot sauce and home made hot peppers sauce and both were super good. As for the ambience, it is cute and cozy, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the chef prepare your food. The wine selection is unique as you can try many wines not found in quebec. I came here with a friend and had a truly wonderful experience. These guys seem to love what they do, I can't wait to be back again."

/user_details?userid=cUlJeY9rpAPErL5zrCs-bg,John A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This review is long overdue. I was recently in Montreal for a friends bachelor party. Needed to find a place that would be good and would accommodate 12 people. Came across Gus and gave them a call and reserved a spot. The staff were really helpful and nice throughout the experience. We got charged $50 a person for platters of food. I was a little worried about the quantity of food since we had 12 very hungry guys in attendance. I was beyond surprised not only at the amount of food we got (we had leftovers) but also at the amazing quality! I can't overstate how great the food was all the way from the salad to the dessert. So much so that the groom was almost in tears (happy tears) and wanted the head chef to cater his wedding. All in all this was an amazing experience and if I'm ever in Montreal I will definitely be going again.

Risa D took us there after dinner for a night cap and dessert... if there was any space at the bar. Just our luck, a few folks were on their way out and we grabbed some highly coveted seats at the bar. It was pretty but with Risa in tow, Dave welcomed us with open arms... literally. We told Dave we'd love to try a dessert or two and maybe a drink. Our waitress was a self proclaimed old fashioned expert so we accepted her challenge with a round of those. Next thing we know, one of every dessert comes out and placed in front of us to share. Dave wasn't a fan of us sharing just one or two and insisted we eat them all. Each one was phenomenal, but one was a variation on a creme brulee and was life changing. We ended up sticking around and getting to know Dave a little better while he heavy-handedly made sure our wine glasses were never empty. A great guy running a great place. I only wish we would have had a chance to do dinner there as well."

We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake which was a tad too sweet and an espresso and cappuccino which was good, but we've had better at nearby coffee shops.

For starters, I ordered an old-fashioned cocktail... it was okay, not the best I've had.For entrees, we had the sausage/pieuvre one with the nachos/foie gras one. The pieuvre was tender, but the portion was really small. As for the nachos/foie gras, it was delicious. My boyfriend, who is picky, couldn't stop eating it.For our main course, we ordered the pork chop and the lamb. The meat was grilled to perfection and I liked their mashed potatoes. It was definitely worth eating there.For desserts, we got the chocolate cake which is topped with like a barley cheesecake mixture and the apple poudding chomeur. The desserts were not as sweet, so it was perfect for my palette. It was definitely the best desserts I've ever ate. The bill came out to be slightly expensive, but  it was worth the trip, since the waitresses were really attentive to us and the owner tried to talk to us as well to make us feel welcome.

We explained to the (cute) hostess our situation and they obliged by offering us a seat at the bar on the condition that we ate along with having a drink. The menu was full of tasty and rich options. The foie gras nachos caught our eye immediately to accompany a glass of wine. We were impressed by the food that was passing us on the way to be served along with our own plate of foie gras nachos. The staff seemed friendly enough and the ambiance was cozy. The check was a little steep at $50, but I guess that's what you get when you are eating foie gras nachos and nice wine.The place was a little small and I imagine it gets rammed on busy nights, but both the wife and I agreed that we would come back and give it a go.

In new York ci ty this would have cost $30 with the 2 Oz of caviar they heaped on top. The onion soup was another hit with an interesting twist of fresh avocados laden on the bottom to keep with the richness without making the dish too heavy.  I wish I had forgone the Foiegwa nachos cause it was def a miss. The foie wasn't seasoned and with the melted cheese and and fried chips there was no flavor added but just unflavored fattiness.  I wish I had ordered the surf and turf for 2 or the cote the boeuf or bavette the boeuf cause they all looked amazing. The last dish of foie nachos however took away my appetite and I was unable to order these dishes. So stay away from that and you will otherwise be supremely happy. Get the ceaser salad!

The shrimp arrives tasteless, no flavour, no salt, no pepper, nothing, with a mango sauce dip, nothing to write home about!Then David calls the order to Josh for the main course, and Josh says last confit! Somehow a short while, 20 ,minutes later, David announces the confit was a mix up, somehow another table was served, he says it will be another 20 minutes? But remembering hearing that that was the last one, sounded strange, there would be another pulled out of the air or freezer? Possibly frozen, so it finally arrives, and is quite ordinary, the agneau does not measure up either, very chewy, but the over praised rapini vegetable of the day, is served sautéed for 30 seconds, raw, bitter, and no flavour! Not even a spec of salt? Leaving quite disappointed, wondering what had just transpired, walked home and felt an overwhelming feeling of illness, something with the canard was very off. Will confer with  friends to see if just maybe it was an off night for the place, or are we just better cooks ourselves?"

The staff was super nice about the accommodation. There is no menu but the choices are listed on the wall throughout the restaurant and our waitress knew the entire thing off the top of her head which was super impressive. We got separate appetizers (cesar salad with bacon, lentil soup and the calamari) and shared the entrees (mussels with spicy fries and the surf n' turf). The wine selection was extensive but overall filled with very good choices and the waitress was super helpful in helping us navigate through the menu.
