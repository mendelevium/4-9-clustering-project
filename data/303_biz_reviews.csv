/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We 6 friends went there for the first time last Friday. It seemed like nice family run restaurant. The atmosphere was ambient and it was not so busy. When we went there we saw only one other older couple just having dinner and enjoying there Friday night. The owner lady seemed super friendly and she attended us couple of times to ensure everything was right. I ordered ginger beef and my wife ordered beef curry with coconut milk. The food was pretty good. My only complaint is that none of the main course menu (beef/pork/chicken/seafood dishes) comes with rice and you need to order rice separately. And given that you need to order rice separately I felt the price for all the dishes are pretty high. Other than the price issue I would say the restaurant is pretty decent.
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Pros: - The service is ok - Food came fast - Quiet ambiance Cons: - The food was not very good. My boyfriend got the crispy noodles and I got the Shanghai style noodles. The Shanghai noodles lacked flavour and the mushrooms in it tasted sour. I've had this dish before in China/other restaurants and it was not like this. The crispy noodles were ok. It was a bit too greasy, but I liked the sauce. My biggest issue with the dishes was that it was not evenly hot everywhere, which leads me to think that it was heated up in the microwave. The sauce was unnaturally hot, whereas some of the toppings (ex. the bok choy) were actually cold."

The decor isn't fancy, but the food and friendly service more than compensate!  The chicken fried rice was delicious and the soups were excellent.  Well priced and pleasant experience overall."

So charming and quaint, lovey people working here, and perfect, down-to-earth, American style Chinese food. Sesame beef and a bowl of hot and sour soup hitting the absolute spot on a cold, snowy night. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Happy to have gathered the courage to venture to this (unappealing on the exterior) Chinese spot so close to where I now call home. I have passed this place many times, even before living on Parc Ave and always dismissed it due to its shabby look. I'm always saying not to judge a book by its cover, but took a while to take my own advice!The menu here is not as extensive as those of the Chinatown greasy spoons (Mon Shing, Beijing, etc), but this place also isn't a greasy spoon as it turns out! We did takeout and I immediately noticed that many items on Wing Fa's menu that were listed as ""sauteed"" are items that are deep fried at other restaurants (like the salt and spice shrimp/We generally have that fried not sauteed). Their menu also states they don't use MSG. Now, I know some people think added MSG is fine/nothing to worry about, but in my experience, since Chinese food is already pretty heavy on the sodium content, when there's a lot of MSG as well, it's easy to roll out of a dinner feeling massively bloated and unwell. So +1 star alone for that and for not charging an extra fee like some places do for no MSG.We had the mooshu pork, Szechuan style sauteed lamb, and the beef fried rice. Again, I was struck by the freshness and lightness each dish (even the rice) exhibited, something to which I am completely unaccustomed when eating Americanized Chinese food.The lady taking our order was also very polite, and the prices are on par with prices in Chinatown ($13-$15 per main dish, $10 for fried rice).Strong bet if you are in the area and don't want to trek to Chinatown!"

This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the food was outstanding, starting with the appetizers of salmon roll (if you're into salmon) and the samples of dumplings. Our entrees were equally delicious. Next time we are in Montreal, Wing Fa will definitely be one of our first stops for dinner."
/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",4 star rating,"We came here on our last night in Montreal because it was near our hotel. Instead of traveling to Chinatown, we decided to stay local and give this place a try. 6:00 on a Saturday: nobody in the restaurant except for one person ordering takeout. And it stayed like this throughout the night, which was unfortunate since the restaurant looks quite appealing. While it was dimly lit, the restaurant was nice and cozy. The menu is not too expensive. They do a more Americanized Chinese food menu, so don't expect to find some of the Chinatown specialties here. We started off with their dim sum, which was pretty good. The shrimp inside was nicely cooked and the skin wasn't too thick. I got their Shanghai noodles, which were a bit greasy. The noodles were thick and perfectly cooked. Their duck was fantastic, though. They have a couple of duck dishes, but we got one that was fatty and so amazing. While the food was great, there was nobody in the restaurant to enjoy it as well, so make sure to stop by if in the area."

It was cold as @&$$ so some hot food was just what I needed. The dumplings and egg rolls were delicious, we were told they're homemade.  Spinach chicken was a wonderful dish with crispy spinach and the Szechuan beef was a perfect balance of spice.  Fried rice was very fragrant and not oily."
/user_details?userid=gHBScZolaF_ze1QZnc_NMA,Candice B.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I have been a customer here since 1998, when I started grad studies at McGill. Simply, this is one of the greatest Chinese restaurants I have tried anywhere in the world (including Beijing). It's a family run business; the food is prepared and served delicately. No MSG. No taste of rotten veggies or reheated chicken to be expected here. Yet it is so cheap (11-14$). My favourite dishes are Shanghai noodles, ginger beef, general tau chicken, and sesame beef. But tasting from friends orders has never disappointed me either. We used to hold many post-defence parties here. Yes they do serve alcohol. Glad to come back to Montreal after a long globe trotting and finding them up and kicking."
/user_details?userid=OP7nO0dIaYW0O6DYX8-azQ,Charles H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The food quality in this place has gone downhill really fast..I just wasted 80 dollars in dinner for two and all I ate was flour, three shrimps and a Hsing Tao beer. We ordered Beef Szechuan which happened to be just big globs of fried dough drenched in sweet n sour sauce, no beef at all, just fried batter... a shrimp dish with six shrimps and a heap of fried noodles (more flour), plus some noodles with vegetables, and obviously more noodles than vegetables...so at the end I must have eaten a pound of flour for which I must have paid around 30 dollars....I love Chinese food, but I always feel ripped off when I go to a Chinese restaurant because what I pay for is not what I get (with very few exceptions)...next time Ill cook my own stuff, I can buy real beef, real chicken, frozen veggies and the spices already prepared at the supermarket (which is what they use at restaurants...I am talking about the spices) ... and it will take the same amount of time it took for my and my dinner companion to get the food on the table, but at least Ill know I am eating real food and not allowing anybody rip me off."
