Our server was really nice and attentive, and the drinks were a good price. Awesome mojitos! The entire place is Cuban themed so it's I kind of fun to step into a tiki bar in the middle of a snow storm. Will come back sometime to try the food!"
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came back for a couple of drinks a Sunday evening. I have to say that the terrace at this time on this day was brilliant. Their Piña Colada deserves a monument. I had their virgin version and it was so good that I ordered a second one. This time the service was fast and on spot. Kudos to their Tiki Bar themed glasses. Why is this place called ""Barraca"" is still a mystery to me. The terrace is extremely cozy for a Sunday evening. Meaning that Barraca becomes a completely different place accoeding to time a day. Big fan of their rum based drinks."

Fortunately, the food was great and the service was very friendly. If you want a flight of meaty appetizers and crab cakes, then this is the place! On a Saturday night the place fills up with a vibrant young crowd so it is not the place to go if you want a quiet evening out."
/user_details?userid=DSFJIs5J1xp8l_fBpUydDw,Sanam A.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Pros: good mojitos and cocktailstons of rum choices great back patio with art and greeneryshrimp tacos were yummyvibe: relaxedmusic not too loud so you can have conversations Cons:Each time I've come, service is really slow. It takes a long time to even be brought menus. I think they just need to hire more waiters !! The last time I came, it was a busy Saturday evening and it appeared that only one server was working and had to handle both the inside of the restaurant/bar and the patio. She was very sweet, but this is overall poor management!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Ehm, so... I have officially found my new favourite TGIF hangout (but Thursday is the new Friday, so it's my new favourite Thursday night hangout). It's probably the best bar experience I've had in the Plateau so far. Our funny, utterly charming bartender who was super attentive and perfect all evening, right up until the end of his shift, completely made our night - thanks, Etienne! It pays to sit right at the bar, I guess! You get to make friends, and there's never any waiting for anything. Barraca is a Cuban-themed rum specialty bar, with a gizillion choices of rum, from the Captain standard to fine choices from all the best French, British and Spanish colony countries: think Haiti, Puerto Rico, etc. Our impeccable bartender/server was kind enough to show up with a round of complimentary rum shots for us, himself included. Nothing like solidifying a friendship. We just didn't want to leave. However, we were most smitten with the AMAZING cocktails - delicious combinations of savoury and sweet flavours. I recommend the Velvet Max (or Max Velvet?) or the Old Fashion Brutal. And, on a Thursday after 9, you get cocktails for a mere $4.50. Can't beat that! Now, TAPAS. OMG. YES. My date and I got the five choice deal, and were completely thrilled with each one: bacon-wrapped, chorizo-stuffed dates; beet and goat cheese and arugula salad; breaded and deep fried pulled pork with bbq sauce; smoked scallops (!); and unbelievably good crab cakes. I'd eat here five days a week if I could. I can't wait to try the rest of the choices out the next time I'm there, and I will be going back.The vibe is extremely relaxed and warm, and makes me happy. Great music all night, a DJ on Thursdays, spacious enough seating and nice air flow. There's a patio in the front and out back, too. Not too crowded or trendy, either - which is GREAT. Right? Because this is MY new spot. See you next time, Etienne. /blowing kiss"
/user_details?userid=kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,Jenna S.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"I wasn't too thrilled with this place, mostly because their menu was pretty small and the tapas were kind of expensive.  The beer selection was decent and my husband liked the cocktail options but the food really wasn't anything to write home about.  We arrived at an early enough hour that there was plenty of seating inside but barely any outside on the patio.  Since it was midsummer, the flowering plants were shedding a bunch of buds and who knows what else so they were falling all over everyone outside the entire time we were there.  Several people even opted to move because it was just too much falling flora for them to enjoy their meal.  The tapas menu wasn't huge, the prices were pretty high considering it's like one or two bites of food, and the food was only OK.  I ordered a few tapas and ended up ordering more because it just wasn't enough food.  If I had been sharing with more than one person we would have run up a pretty high bill because we would have had to order multiple servings of each item just to give each person a bite of the dish.  The drinks were decently priced. Honestly, I think the most upsetting thing about this place was the service.  It was a pretty busy summer weeknight in this place and there was ONE waitress for the entire place (inside and outside).  It was really hard to get refills and to place orders for extra food because she was stretched so thin she was barely around to help customers.  Definitely not her fault but put a damper on our experience here because we couldn't even get her attention when we needed something.  I'm not sure I'd come back here if I had the choice and there's definitely a ton of other restaurants on the same block so there's no shortage of choices."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is horrible!! Don't go! Avoid at all costs!!#1 the service is horrible! We came here for a friend's birthday. We were a group of nine people eating and more people came after for drinks. You could tell the waitress hated her life or her job or maybe both. She was unpleasant. The service was super slow. We showed up at 8pm and only got our food past 10pm! When we got there it took awhile before the waitress asked us if we wanted water or anything else to drink. #2 the food was not very good. I've had way better Spanish tapas elsewhere in Montreal. My boyfriend and I shared the grilled cheese, the burger, the deep fried mac and cheese, the beef tartare and the plate of nuts, olives, salmon, chorizo and cheese.If you really have to come here just chill on the terrace and stick to drinks. They have tons of rum to choose from. My mojito was too sweet but I did like my bloody Caesar and in the end I switched to beer. You can't go wrong with beer. They also have an open bar special and karaoke late at night so that could be fun."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I was there last night with Offer, he gave it a 4 star I think its more of a 3-3.5. The place has all the elements you need for a 5 stars but the loose point on those little things that separate the ""man from the boys"" if you know what I mean. The place has a cool relaxing vibe. dark but still enough light to see everything you need (friends, menu, etc). Cool music but not loud enough so we could have a great conversation without raising our voices. It feels like a cool pub to go to, you can dress up or go casual..just fun. The alcohol is more then reasonable prices and the rum selection is amazing. So why didnt I give it more stars? We ordered 4 cocktails 2 of them were over sweet we had to add soda to tone it down, maybe the barman had a very positive day but I think a place that specializes in cocktails (and I asked for something with rum they recommend) should be more accurate. The food I ordered was ok but not amazing (it was cheap I can give them that) and the service as Offer wrote, they were extremely nice BUT slow (and that was a weak night, half empty place) . Also I didnt like the fact that they have an open bar night on Sat. and its girls 25$ man 35$ as Trudeau said its 2016...."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"If the weather allows, head straight to the very rear where you'll find a little back yard surrounded by greenery. I learned from locals that such an oasis away from the street is unique on Av. Mont-Royal. We were a rather large group so we ordered a whole bottle of rum that came with orange juice and coke to mix at the table. Probably ended up cheaper than if everyone had ordered separately. As I don't like drinking without food, we also got some tortilla chips with salsa, veggie tacos, and sweet potato on a black bean puree. Everything tasted really fresh and super tasty. Other tables ordered combos of three different starters and it all looked amazing. I definitely recommend trying out the food at Barraca."
/user_details?userid=sAAr_EzH5oR_6yYGgbKrfg,Emanuela B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Atmosphere is only ok, and a bit mismanaged. Our cold cuts platter was sad and underwhelming (and not worth the 20$). Would not come back."
/user_details?userid=CGqQZo1c1so0WinqyUyMyw,Lise B.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,Went to Barraca for some happy hour drinks. Sangrias are delicious and staff was friendly and attentive. They have a patio on the street side and in the back which is perfect for summertime weather. Food menu seemed a bit limited. We were looking to order some appetizers but nothing really jumped out to us as shareable although many were ordering the little tacos. Would go back again if we were in the area
/user_details?userid=bt9GKJJLTo75tu_13SfCLQ,Moragh M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Came here and loves the authentic tacos I recommend getting al pastor.... the music was great kind of an Orange County/SoCa vibe!!! I'll definitely come back!

I love mojitos and here they have the right balace... not too much sugar, enough alcohol... really a taste of the south. I had 2 of their snacks.. the hummus and sals chips and it was really really good. Definitely a place to go if you like rum !!!"
/user_details?userid=iwGh8IlpXMdzMyAd5FKmzw,San W.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"First meal in Montreal after a long drive and an even longer walk trying to find the Jean-Talon Market and then failing miserably (in hindsight, we were probably only two streets away...yeah, lets forget that happened).Atmosphere is casual, hip, dark, and loud with space to cozy up at the bar or hang with friends out on the patio. For tapas, you can order one for $8.50, three for $24, or five for $39. There's several to choose from and we enjoyed our bacon wrapped chorizo and dates (perfect combination of sweet and savory), as well as pulled pork croquettes (crispy outside with a saucy, tangy inside). I found the crab cake to be so-so but according to b., I have high standards. (And so what if I do? *sniff sniff*) The charcuterie board was surprisingly large and incredibly filling - alas, I could not finish the small mountain of chorizo before me.For the non-French speakers: we were told that the only English menus they have are the ones posted outside. According to b., they act as a lure. In any case, the menu was easy enough to figure out and our waitress would have explained it to us if we had asked. Service was generally friendly and laidback. Overall, a great introduction to the neighborhood of Mont-Royal where there is plenty to do and see, but most importantly, eat and drink. Cheers."
/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic bar. Excellent cocktails. Very good and cheap food. Low key ambiance - perfect for conversing with friends without straining your vocal cords (we were here on a Sunday night - from what I read on other reviews, this might not be the case on other nights). This place specialized in rum and rum based cocktails, but since we came here during ""invasion cocktails"" week we also tried some of the specials on the menu: - Legionnaire - which tasted like a creamy rich ice coffee, and the beautiful l'apoticaire. Another nice and surprising cocktail was a hot chocolate cocktail. The service in this bar is it's weak point; the staff is super nice, but they are pretty slow. It took them half an hour to take an order, and our server changed three times (which caused some mistakes with the bills). Also, I had ordered bacon wrapped sausage with dates, and about half an hour later the waiter came back to say they don't have dates, and suggested I pick another dish. Then another 20 minutes went by before any server approached to take the order. Again - he was nice and all, but since the place was more empty than full, I would expect a more attentive service. One point to their credit - after serving the cocktails (boy, that took for ever!) the waiter came to make sure we were happy with them, and suggested to add soda to one that my friend though too sweet for his taste.  I honestly had an awesome night here, and if it wasn't for the slow service, they would have gotten a fifth star! I will probably be back later this summer to try the outdoor seating in the back - that looks awesome!"
/user_details?userid=qVRavGPFSpCarN21vCOHRw,Pierre R.,"Montréal, Canada",4 star rating,Really nice place to go if you like Rum.Pretty good Mojito (one of the best I had in Montreal so far) Nice terrace in the back (or in front but pretty small)
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"At Baracca, you can buy a bowl full of chorizo. The only problem is that it only comes with 3 little slices of bread. That is a dangerously low distribution of bread to sausage. You can also buy mojitos. Those come with a very high ratio of booze to mint. So I guess everything balances out in the end."

Extra bonus that we really liked!Plus, outdoor patio w/ heaters for smokers. Looks like it would be a lovely patio to eat & drink outside, but we were there in November ;-)"

I ordered a charcuterie plate , which was huge and delicious, and 3choix option for tapas. The steak tartare was very well seasoned, the chicken wings were really crispy, and the croquette was super yummy. The drinks were also great. Most places don't do caipirinhas right, this place is not one of them. Both their caipirinha and their mojitos were great, not too strong since its Montreal, but great nonetheless.  Definitely recommend."
/user_details?userid=UvZKaPFy85iPjoB2Aj40kQ,Oleg R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the few bars that are more or less rocking 7 days a week. You will always find people having fun here.Drinks are OK, nothing compared to L'Assomoire. Beer selection is large (i dont drink beer though). Tapas are cheap and very good. Location deserves additional mentioning. There are several bars not far, on the same street (Edgar, Distillerie, LaPorteRouge, Bily Kun, Plan B, etc) so its a perfect spot to start your pub crawl in the French area of Montreal."

Yeah, a Monday. I must say I don't really go out during weekdays, but no choice, it was a colleague departure. I was impress by the quality of the rhum i took: a special rhum perfectly mix (it was a Monday's special). Great place to go with friends. I can easily believe that it 's crowded on Fridays and Saturdays. Sorry didn't try the tapas, but I think they must be ""à la hauteur""."
