I have to say, we haven't regretted our choice. The menu was diversified and the food was good. Not to mention how nice people working there were."

/user_details?userid=FFFeLM5rk29RZn6FmGlHYQ,Geraldine G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A lively, new spot near the village!A wide selection of items that hits the spot no matter which one you choose. I had ordered so much but each plate was so good it didn't seem to matter if I knew what it was. LolI did have a favourite, one of their specialties called, Desire. Composed of salmon, scallop, shrimp tempura, spicy mayo, avocado and tobiko. I could have eaten another round of this.You won't go wrong! The tartare was on point. My food companions had the black cod soba noodles and said, it was the best thing they had ever had. The gyoza was delicate but fresh and tasty.  We had ordered a variety of their sushi and sashimi offerings and were pleasantly surprised on how fresh and flavourful their food was.Customer service was fantastic! Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and so funny. She really helped make the evening extra special.The only thing we thought they could use was gluten free soy sauce and gluten free options as those were limited.Otherwise, I would definitely  go again."

My colleague and I had a chance to catch up on conversations during our 7 course meal. Presentation is artsy. Quality of food fresh and we'll matched. Atmosphere quiet, romantic and well suited for good conversation."
/user_details?userid=sNe4WAt7YhGVEWV2We1QCA,Tom S.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"The rice was way too sweet. The nigiri had way too much rice and not enough fish. So the combination of those two made it seem like I was eating sweetened onigiri than nigiri. Totally fine if that's your thing, but it's definitely not mine. Octopus salad and miso soup were alright but nothing to gush over"
/user_details?userid=JIWGSmkroWHq-qs6n3sxUg,Elizabeth T.,"East Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,"Went for 1st. time with my BFF for her birthday and we were very impressed!  We ordered everything the server suggested and it was all very good. We even had seconds on a couple of dishes. Glad we could bring our own wine, that is nice too. What could've been better? Not sure, I did drop by a few days before to ensure our table was reserved and if we could have a slice of 'surprise' birthday cake or desert... I guess it was forgotten. The quality of the sushi and flavors made up for the desert.. we were heading out to the Jazz Festival too... will be back for sure. Thank you Jose and Peter!"
/user_details?userid=sFr1ZQpQ5tixv0PBbANJkg,Raavi A.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It's a BYOB restaurant. A cost place with great service. We took the lunch special and best was even with no vegetarian sushi they made a custom right then and there..it was delicious with the soup and salad. Lived the place.
/user_details?userid=OKLXQG49RlATMZmMYRKRnQ,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Our original 11 person bachelorette plans went awry and we happily stumbled upon this spot before last call. This incredibly kind, hospitable staff seated us in a private room, was super attentive and ensured our group an awesome night. The rolls were excellent too. Thank you for a great night!"
/user_details?userid=SBcVvcxwXYeT8-SInst58A,Michelle S.,"Dummerston, VT",5 star rating,I've eaten there twice in the last calendar year and both meals were amazing. Everyone in my party was very pleased with the quality of their sushi. The server/manager? was a friendly gentleman that politely switches over to English to accommodate his non French speaking guests. He was there both times I ate there. This a BYOB establishment.
/user_details?userid=s1KRrtM9MTtFCODznt4vAA,Hy P.,"Ville-Marie, Canada",3 star rating,"Though the quality of the food is good here, it is way to expensive. You can easily get much more bang for your buck from other sushi restaurants nearby."
/user_details?userid=8OIXy0Z_B3e5EmmBKPa8OA,Danillo D.,"Lynn, MA",5 star rating,Nice and friendly place. Nice food. After we got rejected from other sushi bar across the street we had a nice dinner over here with all respect everyone deserves
/user_details?userid=PgBfcxSlkSUXVhYzhzZy3Q,Ashley W.,"Charleston, SC",5 star rating,Feuille d'Automne & Arc-en-ciel cannot say enough about this place! Romantic but casual atmosphere! BYOB with a place right next door. Food & service was nothing short of AMAZING!!
/user_details?userid=Q2R5rADf8SoMSqpMXP8ycA,Ted d.,"Oshawa, Canada",5 star rating,Fantastic service - we came back for a second night the food was so good. The waiter remember our names and made the evening memorable. We bought a bottle of wine next door which made the meal that much better. Highly recommend this sushi bar.
/user_details?userid=2FaBJ8HjrJ1GfoqXmIHy5g,G R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Do not go here if you are expecting a quiet dinner - it is a small space with no acoustic treatments so the din of the place can be distracting, especially if there is a group seating.  The predominantly black walls are overbearing in such as small space.  Tables are crammed together and very tiny for the amount of glassware.  Very loud and we had the misfortune of having friends of the establishment in who did not stop taking cell phone flash pictures of very loud children - one of whom was playing a cell phone racing game on full volume.   Common restaurant etiquette please for those that dine with children.Sashimi Plate - Great presentation, skilled knife cuts but the choice of fish was pedestrian and did not contain any oily fish - would have been great to have some mackerel.  A selection of tunas, salmon and some octopus - not very adventurous. Beef sashimi - Okay with a bit of a kick but the portion size was incredibly tiny.Edamame - Several of the husks were still filled with boiling water from not being drained enough - not pleasant to eat and get mouthfuls of lukewarm water.Overall, quality is very good, very fresh, but underwhelming for a $30 sashimi plate.  Service was attentive.  Dinner for two including tip came to just under $100.  Lots of great sushi places in Montreal.  I will not be returning to this one."
/user_details?userid=3jlW32mN9cmOJkxSHxM_8A,Robert D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5 star rating,We absolutely loved it! The food was not only tasty but also beautifully presented. The wait staff was attentive and warm. The vibe of the place was great. The fact that it is a BYOB makes it budget friendly as well. We will be back.
/user_details?userid=9HC8ZvFj5VFMuPlCCHNwow,Laura B.,"Cleveland, MS",5 star rating,"This place was fabulous! We went for an early dinner, and there were only two people there, so we were doted on by three wait staff. They were very nice and extremely attentive. It's BYOB, and one of the waiters informed us that next door was a convenience store that sold alcohol. Upon my husband returning from next door with a box of cold beer, a waiter immediately arrived with an ice bucket, opened the box, loaded the bucket with beer, and poured my husband a glass. There is a substantial menu, all of which sounded great, so we ordered chef's choice sushi for 2. We got 4 house specialty rolls, 6 varied sashimi on rice, and 8 simple rolls, of two varieties. 30 pieces in all, for $52. It was all good! Apparently this restaurant has been open for a year, and most of their reviews are on Facebook and TripAdvisor, as few locals use Yelp according to one of the waiters when I asked why few Yelp reviews. Great food, great staff, highly recommended!"
