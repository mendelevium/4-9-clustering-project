/user_details?userid=vOQuq2iNvsu_PHv-wrsQmQ,Mark A.,"Louisville, KY",5 star rating,"Le Serpent is just a fantastic restaurant in Montreal.  The food tasted as great as it looked; many pictures that show that detail were happily added.  The service was also on par with with any other fine dining I visited in the city.  I loved the interior space as well; at night the atmosphere is just fantastic. If you are new to Montreal or visiting, the restaurant can be a little nondescript so be on the lookout when close by."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I had heard a lot about this place so decided to check it out for dinner. Our server was really nice and helpful. I can be very picky when it comes to wine so he really helped me to pick what I really liked. As for food, I ordered the mushroom risotto and tiramisu. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the food. I am not sure if I would ever go back here unless they add some new items to their menu. The risotto tasted bland. And the tiramisu was quite bitter. I have had some delicious tiramisu because it's my favourite dessert. I was really disappointed in this one."
/user_details?userid=_g6P8H3-qfbz1FxbffS68g,Shari A.,"Livingston, NJ",4 star rating,"Put this one on your list if you haven't been. Housed in an unassuming industrial space, the restaurant is not terribly hard to find but best to look for the funky black and white emblem that mirrors the website. We arrived at 7:30 for a reservation at 8pm. The place was hopping but they were able to seat us early. Of note, the bar is reserved seating only on the weekends when they're busy so you can't just show up and grab a drink at the bar before your meal. I ordered a classic negroni cocktail and my husband had a signature cocktail on the menu-both were nicely crafted. The menu is really nice as it allows for even a small party to try various appetizers and half portions of pasta in addition to the entrees. I started with the linguini with speck, truffle and black pepper-really stunning. My husband had the fiori verde with shrimp and Chiles. The flavors were balanced and delicious albeit the shrimp tiny as described by others. The shape of the pasta is very unusual and worth ordering. The duck entree was lovey, not fatty and cooked beautifully medium rare. I enjoyed the artic char. The vegetable of the day was a medley of cauliflower, snap peas, broccolis and mushrooms which were roasted to perfection and very tender. A true standout. We shared the Tiramisu and another chocolate dessert. The tiramisu is a bit overrated but the other one was sublime. The wine selection is also very nice. Service was on point. Would definitely come back when I am in town. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=X7mVSZxStPxD4GbN_29pYQ,Stacey B.,"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"This is five star dining to be sure with excellent service and a nice menu even though it's short.  There are many interesting options on this menu and several really hit the mark.  The Octopus Appetizer was not one of them, unfortunately, because there was barely any Octopus.  The star of the $19 show was absent and we were super bummed about that because we love good Octopus.  The main dishes were excellent although I had to look up Nordic Shrimp because I envisioned big, plump shrimp packed with flavor, right?  NORDIC as in VIKINGS and BIG SHIPS.  Nope.  Teeny tiny, itty bitty, shrimp with the most delicious sauce, kale and pasta I have ever had.  Still a little bummed about the shrimp size but the flavor made up for it.We also tried the braised lamb ravioli dish and that was spectacular in flavor as well.  Rich, hearty lamb flavors with peas and sun dried tomatoes and olives! Fantastic!Dessert was sort of a miss too.  The Tiramisu was way too heavy on the chocolate - it totally overpowered the rest of the dish and the maple pudding with the biscuit just wasn't that exciting to be honest.  It was full of maple flavor and the biscuit was good but it was off balance in texture - almost too much pudding and not enough crunchy contrast.We loved our server!  She was terrific.  It's pretty noisy and tables are super close together and there is a really cool vibe with low lighting and nice music."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"If you are the sort that enjoys a well-balanced mixture of a superb decor, an enjoyable environment​, a gourmet​ menu and warm service, Le Serpent is a must-try in Griffintown, Montréal. This gorgeous​ bistro occupies the main floor of what was once the Darling Foundry, on the industrial flank of old Montréal--and the interior design mirrors the setting. ​Exposed brick, uncovered ducts and pipework, rock hard edges, simple Edison lighting and vast expanses of old warehouse-style paned windows​​. The long bar is even a massive expanse of marble that seems to jut out into the dining area. So, in a word: Cool. The menu is a bit of a surprise for this city as it is decidedly more Italian than French but the kitchen could not help but put​ Franco flair​ into almost every dish they create. This makes for a wonderful​ Fusion experience without a bit of pretense. The rich​ co-existence of many contrasting elements like this makes Le Serpent surely is a novel restaurant that attracts a diverse and eccentric​​ clientele.  As for the cuisine itself? Superbly executed​. I recommend​ starting with the innovative Crudi which sports a kit of 3 items including Scallop, Salmon, and a very impressive​ Fluke which are all ocean fresh and prepared scratch to order. This is most definitely​ sharing material and nobody would judge a table that ordered two - they really are that good. If you are a ​fan of Malfadine, look no further than the simple, straightforward​ Nero featuring Clams, Broccoli, fried Bread, and seasoned lightly with Lemon & Salt. At $28.00 this is an absolute steal. For the ladies,​ I would argue the lead pipe lock is Le Serpent's Lobster Risotto which is loaded with yellow Beet, zesty Basil, and gobs of Mascarpone around ample chunks of Lobster goodness. Le Serpent is another must try in Montréal - but I am certain you are tired of me saying that by now. Just go."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I hosted a dinner party for four at Le Serpent. This was my first visit. This place is off the beaten path but worth seeking out! The decor is upscale with lots of dark wood accents and industrial looking lighting. Speaking of upscale, the customers were far better dressed than average for the port area so glam it up a little when going! We shared apps: oysters, fois gras  and octopus. Almost everyone ordered the evening special of bison short rib with a lone holdout choosing the cod. Desserts varied between cheese, maple custard, and hazelnut cake. The table raved about the quality of the food and service. This was a top notch experience!"
/user_details?userid=41A6NfRlbNEHUawOKR3wOA,Mike M.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"Usually one star reviews come from upset customers. That is not the case here, the staff was great - this one instead comes from one very offended palette. It was dish after dish of the oversaturated flavors, with the largest offenders being the ""special"" pasta which was basically pasta drowned in butter and a fish in what essentially soupy BBQ sauce. Montreal lived up to the hype as a foodie town but Le Serpent was an unfortunate aberration."

The restaurant decor is really beautiful, modern yet industrial and the lights we slightly dimmed which was very romantic. Everything on the menu sounded really interesting, aside from the menu, they had 3-4 daily specials.The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. They made great recommendations and helped us order the right amount of food for two.We started off with the burrata and foie gras as our appetizers. Never in my life have I tasted a better burrata! It wasn't a classic burrata, it was quite smokey and different but it was absolutely amazing on their rosemary focaccia bread. The waitress had recommended the foie gras. It was very fruity and delicous especially on that warm brioche bread they brought with it. My bf said it was his favourite foie gras (and trust me hes tasted SO many). We were already blown away by the appetizers.We then decided to order a dish of pasta as our main and their famous veal orzotto. Wowwwwww both dishes we honestly fantastic, every bite was a mix of 3-4 different ingredients that blended so well together it was amazing. The orzotto was a barley risotto with veal and foie gras shavings on top. It was sooooooo creamy and so different. 11/10.  We loved le serpent so much we're planning on going back very soon. Prices were not bad, the quality of the food was honestly top notch!We were so full we didnt have enough room for dessert, I heard they have an awesome dessert menu. We'll be sure to try out their desserts next time!! Thank u so much le serpent for a delicous and unforgettable meal"

Location beautiful, service wonderful, food: meh.We had a very diverse set of dishes, from the risotto ( which tasted like it had cream, great risotto doesnt need cream), to the bison ( not really as tender or tastey as it could have been), fish ( meh), and a few other things.  The deserts looked great in terms of plating but tasted mediocre. Except,  frankly, the tiramisu.  The tiramisu was the only dish which I will say tasted great. Would definitely not go back."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Last night was my third visit at this resto and I can finally write the stellar review it deserves! An invite from a fellow foodie and blogger turned to an amazing evening of delicious food, great service, and memorable fun. The venue itself is just perfect; nice marble bar at the entry, beautiful industrial chic decor, and beautifully minimalistic tables settings. The dim lighting and dark walls add to the space and vibe. Our group decided to share plates to get a better feel of the menu and I'm so happy we did; every dish was as good as the next and most really stood out for the delicious play of flavours and textures. We started with the foie gras parfait, rabbit tart, and burrata; the rabbit tart was perfection, and the foie gras with the buttery brioche was delectable. Then came pasta!! There was not one dish that wasn't just perfectly executed and flavourful; I understand why everyone highly recommended the linguini dish but the truffle ravioli was stupendous. For mains, we opted for the pork jowl, grilled duck, and lobster risotto. Although the risotto was a little heavy on the parm for my taste, overall the dishes were very flavourful and well presented. Finally was dessert, with a chocolate cake, tiramisu, maple pudding, and citrus tart; although all were delicious, I preferred the tiramisu and chocolate cake mostly cause they aren't as sweet and I live for coffee and chocolate combos. The service was very attentive, from clearing the table to constantly filling our glasses, we were surely taken care of. The waitress was also very helpful with wine pairings, and I most enjoyed my chardonnay. This place is surely on my tops for the amazing food and service, and with a smaller price ticket for the quality of service and food, I will surely return again."
/user_details?userid=R1reG7vADOsjbw388rH88Q,Frances C.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"Our first dinner in Montreal and it has set the bar for Montreal restaurants quite high! We ordered their daily special appetizer which was seared scallops and it was done just right! The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce and very buttery. The four of us ordered the rotisserie for two which was roasted whole branzino with olives, pistachio and dill. I have never had such a nice aromatic yet soft roast fish before! It was delicious! The meat was soft and the pistachio with pickled olive slices give it a very nice balance to the soft roasted meat!  It has a nice Mediterranean slant and the lime gave it a very light aftertaste!!  The dish came with roasted veggies and the veggies were so crispy. The veggies sat on a bed of bell pepper and millet puree and the presentation was wonderful!! A meal cannot be complete with desserts! We ordered four desserts including the recommended Felicita! The lemon tart was very light and I find that mascarpone a bit too overpowering. The almond cake was okay and the chestnut ice cream tasted soooooo good! That alone can be a standalone offering! Felicita was the best! A chocolate cake with a nice crispy base, the mousse was not too sweet and one could tell the ice cream is homemade! Really really tasty!! The last dish is Tiramisu. Coffee was too strong and so was the chocolate. It almost tasted sour! Server was courteous and professional! Luv this place! Will come back for aure!!"

I came here with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner on a Friday evening. The restaurant is so beautiful inside very modern and elegant but still cozy and comfortable, dimly lit and Romantic. The entire staff was so friendly and welcoming. Our server was very attentive , efficient and very pleasant ! we ordered wine (they have a sommelier on site who can help with suggestions). We had the octopus starter that comes with a salsa verde and potato puree. The octopus was cooked perfectly , the potatoes were so creamy and tasty and the salsa verde added a nice kick. As the main, I ordered the roasted duck that comes with apricot purée and root vegetables , it was absolutely perfect ! Everything on the plate tasted amazing and complimented eachother so well , the duck was cooked and seasoned to perfection as well! my boyfriend had the wild boar gnocchi , while the sauce for it was simple, the meat was cooked so well and was perfectly seasoned , the gnocchi had that perfect pillowy texture. we really loved both of our meals ! The dessert was good as well. the server happened to overhear us mentioning it was my birthday and brought out a sparkler with it , which I found very thoughtful and a nice touch ! Even on our way out the hostess wished me a happy birthday. I loved this place -great food , great decor/atmosphere and great customer service -you can't go wrong !"

The gnocchi boar ragot was the best I've tasted. I'd rate it higher if I could. Fantastic atmosphere for a special occasion or intimate date.

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Serpent is an industrial landscape turned urban dining room. Be warned the menu is on the expensive side. The wine selection and menu are of only high quality. This is my second visit here, but this time for dessert since I was joining friends after dinner. I tried their appetizer, tuna tartar 2/5 at 23$ that was presented on a slice of tomato that concealed the true flavours of the tuna, it would've been nice to have some bread or crackers to have with it. I opted for the Paloma drink which was refreshing. Cocktails are affordable starting at 10$. For dessert I was expecting cheese cake 1/5 but got a deconstructed version of it instead (not very impressive). I give points for attempted creativity but the essential elements of a cheesecake are still lacking. I will definitely skip on dessert during my next visit,"

It is situated in an old garage and when you walk, you walk into a dark entrance that looks like a club. But once inside the bar and soft decor welcomes you.We were a party of 6 and all the appetizers ordered were delicious. Especially the fish 3 ways and the warm octopus. The octopus was tender and the puree was seasoned perfectly.The mains also were a success. The risotto with braised lamb was awesome (although I expected the shank to be there, the meat was removed from the bone and spread throughout the dish.). The salmon was fresh and tasty and so was the cod.All dishes were presented beautifully.I tried the tiramisu with expresso and it was delightful. They actually pour the expresso over the dessert in front of you. Nice touch!Definitely to be redone.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…"

To begin with, loved the ambiance... it was the perfect amount of lighting and sound to enjoy the food, and the company I was with. My date and I sat at the bar, where the bartender was able to recommend a nice wine for my date before we finally decided on oysters with a maple mignonette as well as the foie gras and burrata appetizers.While I LOVE anything foie gras (this one was especially tasty!) and the burrata with the beef carpaccio was delicious, the mignonette for the oysters was a little odd to me... obviously no marks lost for this, just wasn't what I was expecting.For mains I had the linguini with speck, cauliflower and truffles while my date ordered the braised beef ravioli. I expected to enjoy mine - and I really did - but what I didn't expect was to enjoy my date's dish MORE. There was something about the broth it was in that was comforting, and tasty... if there had been a spoon to drink it all in, I would have done just that. Next time, I will be sure to order this myself! Fantastic restaurant, easily one of my new favourites in all of Canada. Yup, you heard me."

/user_details?userid=t-0_us3OTzs_ZhKy6fcamg,Dawn M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Very swanky spot serving great food, with the prices to match. It's hidden in what looks like an industrial building from the outside, but on the inside it's a very warehouse-chic.To be honest, I wouldn't come here on my own unless it was for a special occasion, but I was brought here by a colleague. She was treating, which always makes me kind of wary of ordering too much or anything expensive, so I didn't eat a whole lot as a result. But what I did have was excellent. We ordered a really nice wine, shared some oysters (they really know their oysters!), and I had a pasta dish.This place is an interesting concept because their dishes are kind of fusion - East meets West with heavy emphasis on the West. Or maybe it's better put to say it's Italianish with some Asian influences. But the structure of the menu is Italian for sure - there are first course pasta dishes (you can get a larger size if you're only having pasta), and then meat dishes. I had a first course-sized pasta, which was not enough because I'm a big eater but again, a colleague was treating. It was al dente, deliciously flavoured, and beautifully presented.This is the kind of place you might take a date if you really want to impress them!"

What makes it 5 star that it also got the classy food to back up. From the moment we entered they treated us with class. Took our coats/jackets to be hung so we could enjoy the dinner with comfort. We were shown to our seats and boom our journey of a sexy restaurant night started. A lot of restaurants focus so much on being presentable and stylish that they lose focus on the other things. Our server was very humble yet informative about the menu. He was very detailed which helped us make our dinner choices. He didn't hover around and kept checking in on us at the appropriate intervals. Didn't feel rushed at all which was surprising considering how busy the place was. Food recommendations; the linguini. Yumm! The slight hint of truffle oil was just mind blowing. And of course the Friday evening special BBQ duck was just mouth watering. Since the night had been so amazing a dessert was in order and glad we didn't skip that. The chocolate roll with ice cream though sounds simple but it was just orgasmic. The interior is very industrial like yet feels warm. Though Friday night and I'm assuming same for sat, it's very busy and trendy. Looking for a place for a date night or hanging out with friends/family over scrumptious meals in Montreal then this is your destination."

The restaurant was extremely accommodating as we kept having to call prior to the reservation to make adjustments as we were running late (we were traveling in from the states). The management was super friendly and upon arrival had a perfect table set for us. The decor is very cool and the vibe of the restaurant is FUN. Walking down the street and into the front door, you would never expect such a unique restaurant hidden within the walls. We ordered some drinks and apps (burrata & octopus) and everything was delicious. The waitress was incredibly knowledgable about  the menu and had great recommendations. We ordered a bunch of their dishes (linguini, bucatini, lobster risotto, vegetables for the vegetarian, etc) and shared and everything I tasted was amazing. You can definitely tell the pasta is fresh and the consistently was just perfect. My favorite dish was the bucatini and I know I will continue to have dreams about it. As we did have a vegan and vegetarian, the restaurant again was incredibly accommodating despite such a limited menu for this restriction.Overall, a wonderful experience and I highly recommend for the ambiance, the great service and delicious food."

Also ordered their pork jowl but mainly out of curiosity. Seemed well executed but, as it turns out, not my thing. One potentially informative critique: I felt that, aside from the cipollini onions, the side elements weren't ideal complements to the main ingredient. Finished with the lemon dessert. It was a nice way to end things and not too heavy.My colleagues liked the wine they tried but I couldn't partake (work call just after dinner for some reason...).Staff was competent and reliable but not particularly warm. So not additive but, more fundamentally, not subtractive in any way either. Not the kind of place where you'll get to know the staff after several visits - but, in most settings, that's perfectly fine for sure."

I actually fell in love with the orzotto with beef that my friend took since it was so well balanced and the taste of beef was just amazing! The very well known linguini of Serpent also lived up to its reputation, as well as the fish plate that my other friend tried, we had a great time at this beautiful and trendy restaurant.

Housed in a warehouse looking building and behind a mysterious black door, Le Serpent is a ultra modern restaurant that serves up some great food and offers an excellent wine selection.I came on a Tuesday evening and dined at the bar because, well the bar is the best seat in any restaurant. Grabbed a few glasses of wine and then got the run down on the menu from the bartender. For my meal I had risotto and linguini. The risotto was very good and the linguini was delicious. The portions were a little on the small side, but the meals themselves were excellent. The other stand out, which kind of freaked me out a bit, was the fact that the meals were prepared and served in less than five minutes after I ordered. It was to the point where I had to ask if the food was already pre-made, to which the server replied that the chefs are just that good. Very impressive! All in all a great restaurant in a city that is overflowing with great dining options."

Then you know you'll arrived. We were walking down the street and I walked right by this place and had to double back because I definitely didn't think there was a legit resto inside.We walked in and were immediately and energetically greeted by one of the bartenders. We were taken to our seats and were immediately given water. Just from that opening interaction, I was sold. Our server came over and went over the menu, but most importantly, gave us enough time to review it and make a decision. We started with the Crudi, which was 3 (very small) pieces of fish and seafood. To be specific, there was a piece of salmon, a piece of scallop, and some other type of fish. They were all served raw and prepared with different tastes. They were all delicious. One was savory, one was kinda sweet, and one was more acidic. I ordered the lobster risotto as my main dish and it was fire. It was a bit pricey for what you actually get, but I felt full after. My bf ordered the oxtail pasta and it was fiiiiirrre. It's rare that he orders something and I feel like we need to switch dishes, but let me tell you, I would have fought him for his dish. The oxtail was tender and melted in your mouth.

I could eat the pumpkin raviolis for dinner every single night, they were that good. Perfectly al dente in a light but flavorful sauce. Great staff- friendly and attentive, loved the wine our waitress suggested. I hope to be back the next time I'm in town."
