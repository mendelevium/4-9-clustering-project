/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"What an experience this restaurant is!!As soon as you walk in downstairs, they make you feel welcomed and COVID measures are directly taken (temperature check and hand gel).Marcus is on the third floor and the floor it's on has a lounge area and a bar as well. The bathrooms are absolutely splendid and deserve their own moment! The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning. It is very obvious a lot of thought has been put in the design and architecture process. We were greeted by our waitress who immediately brought us hot bread with sumac butter, it was delicious! We ordered oysters, the tomato salad, the green salad as starters. Everything was very good, felt very fresh as well. The oysters had two different sauces on the side and both were delicious. The tomato salad is, in my opinion, better than the green salad. The mix of ingredients and the mozzarella just ties the whole plate together.As main plates, we ordered the gindara salmon (absolutely delicious, the glazed gindara is phenomenal), the chicken breast (could've gone without, wasn't the most impressive), the fried chicken (was a little scared to order this at first, but definitely did not regret, it was out of the ordinary. The spicy honey sauce is incredible) and the wagyu burger (extremely tender meat, very well put together).All and all, Marcus is an out of the ordinary culinary experience in Montréal. I would definitely go there again, maybe try brunch this time!"
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,"You definitely pay for the location and decor more than the quality of the food.Located inside the Four Season Hotel downtown. The restaurant is very nice and has an open terrace. Must say that the restaurant and hotel did a good job at taking precautions during the pandemic. You must disinfect your hands as soon as you walk in the hotel and must wear a mask until you seat down at your table. I went to the bathroom during dinner and had forgotten to put my mask and was reminded that I must wear a mask while walking around ~ good job! The restaurant also added flexi-glass separator in between tables that were too close to each other.Now for the drinks ~ good selection and drinks were nice but definitely ok the pricey side. The cheapest glass of bubbly was $20.For the food, I took a tuna tartare and it didn't look nor tasted amazing for the price tag. I had made a tuna tartare myself over the weekend and it tasted and looked much better than what has been presented in such a "" high end "" restaurant. As for the crowd there...definitely people who want to be seen ~ younger patrons in their early 20s. If not, much older people with money most likely people who are staying at the hotel.I feel like this is a place you go to be seen and pay for the decor rather than for the food itself.Ok for business lunch or dinner but would not recommend if you simply want to eat a good meal."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wanting to see this restaurant for myself, when my friend wanted to do her birthday brunch there, I jumped in!   We reserved a table for 11am and the restaurant was about half full. For a group of 6 we took the half circle table with a bench. Whole waiting for the rest of the group to arrive, the waiter suggested me and Mimosa so I said sure why not. They're a little bit pricey--they're $16 a pop. The brunch menu includes the AYCE dessert table. So I chose my main with desserts in mind. My pick was the beet gravlax.  I enjoyed the gravlax but the rest of the dish was underwhelming--the salad tasted like there was no dressing on it and the toast was quiet tough and difficult to cut through. My friends liked the avocado toast with the runny egg on top and the eggs Benedict which comes with a bowl of bacon. The red endive salad wasn't so great as the other friend struggled to eat it. The dessert table however was the redeeming factor for me. The strawberry tart is absolutely delightful.  You must get a slice! The table ran out of strawberry tarts and we asked the waiter for more so he brought us three extra slices to our table. The coffee is unlimited refills so I think my friends drank 3 cups of coffee each!! It's nice to finish the meal with pickings from the dessert table. I told them it was my friend's birthday so they brought a flan with a sparkler in it and gave her the Mimosa for free. That's a nice little treat :) Service was nice but not extraordinary. We had to wait a little bit for our waiter to come find us but otherwise, he was very pleasant. The brunch menu is reasonably priced--if you don't go for a Mimosa!!"

My husband and I had dinner here. 1/5/2020.The restaurant was looks expensive and it is!!! But every thing we ordered was very good and creative of course very fresh. We ordered whole red snapper with bokchoy. And watermelon and tomatoes caprese. Watermelon was strong seared with Gin that was very different and tasty with caprese.  Red snapper was very fresh and cooked very well with simply tasty. Also Bokchoy cooked great. I would try to come back here in the summer time.
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Sunday morning around 8 am, I went to Marcus for breakfast with a friend. The building is easy to find with its neon at the entrance, the greeting at the door was courteous.The restaurant is located on the third floor, at the opening of the elevator doors you'll find a reception desk. The hostess asked me if I was a client of the hotel, I replied no and that I just came for breakfast with a friend. It was early, the restaurant was empty ... And there things became a little weird.I am a person who likes taking photos and so I was happy to have arrived before the crowd, I thought that I could take beautiful ones... Except that the hostess directed me to a table in a corner behind a wall, so my angle for photos was very limited. I found it strange considering all the vacant space. Five minutes later, a young woman arrived and was seated in the middle of the room, followed by a couple, which was seated at the other end close to the windows.My waiter asked me if I wanted something to drink while waiting for my friend, I asked him if he had mocaccino, he answered, what? Given the look he gave me, I figured it was useless to try to explain and asked him for a simple latte. My friend finally arrived, she was barely seated that the waiter rushed with our orders, she literally had to choose while he waited next to the table (no pressure at all).I ordered the Benedictine eggs with a juice. The Benedictine eggs were good but nothing creative or even extraordinary, for comparison, I recently went to Radicelle and had to most creative and tasty Benedictine eggs ever (100% worth the trip!).We had just finished eating, our plates were cleared and instead of asking us if we wanted anything else, the waiter informed us that he will be bringing our bills. My friend and I looked at each other in surprise, not understanding his eagerness given the almost empty restaurant. After having paid, we pursued with our conversation and a waiter passed by our table to check if there was anything to get rid of. We left.The interior of this restaurant is exceptional, I'd easily give it a 5/5, my Benedictine eggs were good but nothing innovative, I didn't really like the texture of the biscuit, the juice was also a little bit too watery for me and honestly, I was expecting way better food, I'd rate it 3/5. Finally, the service was very cold, I clearly felt like they did not want me there, so I'll give it a 2/5... and message received, I won't be back."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been waiting for the opening of this restaurant for what feels like forever, having discovered Marcus Samuelsson's cuisine at Red Rooster. Unfortunately besides the venue itself, the whole experience was disappointing. The restaurant is located on the third floor of the Four Seasons hotel in downtown Montreal and also boasts a great terrasse. The space itself is beautiful; very Art Deco  with gorgeous brass touches, marble flooring and tables, and comfortable leather banquets. Definitely a place you'd go to be seen; we were there on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed solid with elegantly dressed clientele. As for the atmosphere, the space turned into a somewhat supper club with music going up a few notches around 9 pm. Once seated, our waitress apologetically greeted us for taking so long, and nicely explained the menu. It took along while before we saw her again and putting our order in was painful; she also had issues opening the bottle of wine to which we gladly helped her. The staff bringing the good over to our table seemed confused; they couldn't even answer our questions regarding the dishes. Having to ask for constantly ask for water at such an establishment is really a shame. The menu, as explained, is made to share so decided to start our evening with some oysters, and had a few appetizers including the salmon tartare, and the boneless chicken wings; note that we were four sharing but there were only three wings. The tartare comes in two sizes so that was easily split amongst us. We decided to order our mains separately. There were many specials available but I decided to go for the Cornish hen. The dish was underwhelming and I found the hen very dry. Thankfully, the deserts were a big hit. My chocolate coffee cake served with cardamom ice cream was perfection! Yeah! I'm hoping that the venue irons out their issues with service, as this place really is a nice addition to the Montreal scene; too bad the food was less than dazzling or might give it another chance. Will keep on my list for an apéro perhaps..."
/user_details?userid=6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",4 star rating,"I gave it 4 stars, but's it's more of a 3.5 because of the food. The place is very beautiful and trendy. I requested a spot on the terrasse but they said they couldn't guarantee it and we didn't get to sit outside. They served water almost right away. Corona measures were put into place such as plexiglass between tables and the staff wore masks. But the people at the tables didn't wear masks. The drink I got was amazing: Forbidden fruit. So tasty and the alcohol hits you later. The appetizers we got were great: tuna tartar with salad instead of fries (meal size), and the tomato salad. Me and my hubby shared 3 main meals and they were disappointing. All very small potions. The sea bass was very tasty but tiny. The lamb chops have a lot of fat on them and I just generally wasn't a fan. And the chicken breast was ok."
/user_details?userid=JXn62GKSc3ZnyUQd3A5nFA,Magda C.,"Englewood, CO",5 star rating,"Outstanding and expensive. This is a modern, sleek restaurant that's fairly new inside Four Seasons.But let's talk about the food: everything was executed perfectly, texture and taste balanced every dish like a true chef knows. Service was excellent, we were accommodated right away without reservations made in advance.Get the chocolate cake dessert, it's great with nothing else next to it.And the halibut which is perfectly crispy and fresh."
/user_details?userid=jZ1I9_UDhUC9JlScXqp12A,Hassan H.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"This place is beautiful!!! Lovely views.. it made my wife happy that's for sure. I could sit in here all damn day.. The Brunch menu is very small but spot on really, they have everything you would want to eat listed. Our waiter was very nice and friendly and recommended a Jasmine Tea for me because they didn't have matcha. My wife ordered a latte and said that it was very good. The place wasn't very busy which was nice, they played smooth jazz and some R&B over the radio which pairs nicely with neat art pieces hanging on the walls. We loved the food, everything as fresh and clean. I though the yogurt was extremely good. It was very creamy and the honey add a nice hint of sweetness. The veggie omelette was fantastic as well."

/user_details?userid=V73BXQhplHK54aPk7-bmfQ,Inga S.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Pretty impressive ambience which I would give 5 stars, food is good with some minor issues deserving 3.5 stars but the service is below everything. The restaurant is located within four seasons hotel so you come with high expectations and get a total disappointment. It's a relatively new place and that could be a reason but the service we received deserves not more than 2 starts. Our waitress would not even refill our water and we would wait for a long time for her to show up. I believe she had a few tables to serve and could not distribute the time evenly. We ordered crab piccadilly pasta which was spicy and had good edge of interesting flavors, slightly overcooked. Halibut with eggplant puree and small pieces was really good except the purée which was very salty.Coconut cake dessert is a must, very light, mixes well with mango sorbet on top of it."
/user_details?userid=p_eViZiZwmE7R0FJnsZQDw,Victor U.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to Marcus with the girlfriend for date night. The restaurant was on the top floor of the 4 season and had an impressive decor: dim lights, quiet background music and chic tabling. We started with the octopus platter, which was good but not excellent (nor worth the 28$ tag). I got the 28 day chicken plate and the girlfriend got the crab pasta. The chicken was delicious and well cooked, but no taste difference from a regular chicken. The crab pasta had a strong seafood taste, so it was difficult to finish the whole plate.The bread was delicious too."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We were a group of four who came here for dinner on a Friday night.  I was excited to try out the restaurant because of Marcus Samuelsson's reputation.  The restaurant is on the third floor of the hotel and features a chic interior.  Despite the fact that it is an upscale restaurant it doesn't have an ultra formal vibe to it.  Seafood is the star here.  We started with a seafood platter which at $150 was suitable to split four ways.  It consisted of oysters, clams, shrimp, several kinds of sashimi, lobster and crab.  For the most part I enjoyed it with the tuna sashimi being my favourite part.  Certain aspects of the platter though missed the mark such as the clams.From there we split halibut and pasta with crab.  Both dishes were very well prepared though the pasta could have contained more crab.  I did like the addition of breadcrumbs to the pasta.  It added a little crunch to the dish.For dessert we split sorbet, doughnut with peanut butter ice cream and apple fondant.  The sorbet was mango flavoured and the mango dominated the taste.  It wasn't overly sweet.  The doughnuts were just okay but the peanut butter ice cream was excellent.  As for the apple fondant I found that it was okay.  Nothing terrible but nothing great either.There were also issues with the service.  It seemed that our waiter paid more attention to some tables than to others.  Perhaps he thought that he could get a better tip from those tables?  We also never received bread and upon asking about this we were told you only got bread if you asked for it.  That being said the waiter never told us this at the beginning of the meal so we didn't know that this was how the restaurant operates.As much as I wanted to like Marcus it just didn't live up to the hype.  If I am paying top dollar for a meal I want to be blown away and I have to say that I wasn't.  I feel like the restaurant has potential but it hasn't reached it just yet."

Was such a pleasure to dine in this beautiful restaurant. The food was spectacular and great ambience. Alex and Benjamin were astonishing in their service and presentation. This is one place we will return. Celebrating our 10th anniversary couldn't be more spectacular
/user_details?userid=0L4l5SNLf9np6OM32sAnAQ,Justin K.,"Richmond, Canada",5 star rating,"Love the ambiance and open layout of Marcus as it's an open terrace at night which turns into a lounge. Montreal is know for their supper clubs and this is no exception. As we were visiting for a 24hr layover, I made sure to book his restaurant a month in advance as availability is limited (I recommend doing the same) We started the night with their modern twist cocktails and the salmon belly. As for the main dishes, we had the scallops and halibut. Everything met our expectations and I would definitely come back again as I heard his spaghetti piccadilly is his signature dish. I've been to a couple of his restaurants in Scandinavia and I can confidently say the quality is consistent. Great job Marcus, another win in the books for an amazing restaurant in an amazing city!"
/user_details?userid=e30nkqMd2leReeIllmQdfw,Ella C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Love love everything. I went for my anniversary with my husband and we loved it. Crab pasta was unique. The sauce and thickness of pasta was great match.Salmon belly is must to everyone. I dont know what more to explain about the food... its just beyond amazing. Ambiance... just go and see for yourself. Your eyes will appreciate it.
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a must see. The view is not so incredible, however the atmosphere and design of the terrace/restaurant is beautiful. I came here for a drink on Wednesday night and it was full. I was somewhat surprised but at the same time I understood why. The decor is beautiful and the music was great. There was a live DJ too which made it feel like a lounge. The cocktails are really tasty, both my friends and I really enjoyed what we got. I would highly recommend visit this place. However, just be aware that it is quite pricey. But, the atmosphere really does make up for it"
/user_details?userid=7y7zD8-ktgj2faQ3ZLHnnQ,Matthew S.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I had dinner with a group of 5 people at Marcus in Montreal, which is on the 3rd floor of the Four Seasons. The restaurant has a very modern, relatively open design. The menu is seafood heavy, but there are non-seafood and vegetarian offerings.  The tuna tartare was a very nice dish as was the robata chicken. I had scallops for an entree which was excellent, too. The service at Marcus was very good, too, with knowledgeable and friendly staff. They have a very nice bar/lounge area, too. Overall, a great spot in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Was looking forward to the long awaited opening of the Four Seasons and Marcus restaurant.  I've always been a fan of the Four Seasons brand mainly for their excellent service whenever I've been fortunate enough to stay or dine at their properties. My initial impression was a little dubious when I called to reserve and later called to change the number of people in the party, as both times resulted in lengthy times on hold and being transferred more than once only to be told the restaurant was ""not available"" and would call me back (they didn't).  So the front desk needs a bit of polishing up it would seem.On the day of our brunch reservation, our group arrived and again there was confusion as to where to seat us which eventually got sorted out. The restaurant is truly gorgeous from a visual standpoint, sleek and modern while still warm and inviting.  You feel classier just sitting there. Once we were seated, service was quite good, attentive and polished with just a whiff of condescension I could have done without. The brunch menu is very appealing and quite reasonably priced for the location.  Coffee and mimosas were excellent.  We shared the VIP tower for 4, with eggs, waffles, fried chicken, bacon and sausages.  It was very good, particularly the chicken and waffles.  As a nice touch, we were invited to help ourselves to the dessert table at the end of the meal free of charge.  Unfortunately we were too full to do anything except sample a few bites, but everything we tried was delicious.  Overall a positive experience, a beautiful space with very good food and a few service kinks to be worked out.  I'd definitely go back for brunch and would like to try dinner as well.  It also seems like a wonderful place to go for an evening cocktail."
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"I'd like to start my review by saying that I am giving Marcus 4 stars ONLY because I have only been to the brunch service, but I am planning in the near future to try their dinner service (and pretty much expect to give a perfect score).As a group of 8 people, we decided to brunch here because they allowed reservations. Entering the 4 seasons is quite something, and the restaurant is already worth going based on how beautiful it is. I'm not kidding, even the bathrooms are breathtaking! 4 of us shared the VIP tower which was $100 and it came with waffles, scrambled eggs, fried chicken, bacon and sausage. The idea of sharing is awesome and although the food items were ordinary, they were all tasty. Particularly the scrambled eggs; they were so velvety and light. Mind you, portion was not huge so we were not full but that's okay because the star of the show was the dessert table. It was always full, fresh, perfect bite sizes, a good variety and so delicious. Even when there isn't a huge selection of dishes and the menu items are pretty ordinary, by having that unlimited dessert table is what makes this place killer! That's why price point for brunch, totally worth it. Service was good, above average but not extraordinary. So if you're looking for a brunch spot, especially for a big group or for an event, I highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is drop dead gorgeous and the level of service offered will blow your mind. During their opening weekend, my partner and I visited for brunch. The restaurant is located in the newly opened Four Seasons hotel. The doorman warmly greeted us outside, escorted us to the restaurant and chatted with us along the way. Our server was very patient and handled my indecisiveness like a champ. She was attentive and checked in often. At one point, one of managers came over to check on us. We felt well taken care of!We tried the Hoe Cakes, which are like cornbread pancakes, the fried chicken sandwich, and the Bourbon Eggs Benedict. The portions were good and for that caliber of restaurant, I found the prices to be reasonable also. I'd give the food 4 stars. Though it was great, it didn't meet my expectations. I've visited another one of chef Marcus's restaurants, Red Rooster in Harlem, and the food was unreal and bursting with Southern flavours. Because of my experience with Red Rooster, I think I was expecting the same of Marcus. Don't get me wrong, the dishes that I tried at Marcus were delicious, but they didn't leave me in awe.Considering the fact that they were open less than a week when I visited, I'm sure they were still fine-tuning recipes. Once they've settled, I will 100% visit again. Even if only for the service, ambiance and decor, I'd still return!"
/user_details?userid=seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg,Stéphanie S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A wonderful find! We stumbled upon this brand new restaurant... before the actual opening! They are located inside the new Montréal Four Season's hotel which is opening also in three days!They are operating in pre-opening and some aspects are still in the work, for instance, the wine by the glass prices were lacking prices and our waiter had to find it out.But otherwise it was a memorable experience.The menu has clearly some Ethiopian influence as most plates have spices accents. For instance my smoked salmon appetizer had a mixed of spices and some flowers mixed in. It was served with injera ""chips"" (done by an Ethiopian cook with teff). I had a hanger steak done in a berbere rub and served with a chimichurri sauce. The result was a succulent mixture of flavors.We ended our set menu with a delicious coconut mousse.The service was attentive, warm and professional. The execution was perfect which is great for such a young restaurant.The setting of the restaurant that integrates a huge open terrace is simply spectacular. We were told that the Four Season did invest $80 million in the restaurant.I think I can still go on for a while on my appreciation of the place but I'll leave some for the others. I just hope that they will be able to keep the experience at this level while the place fill up!"

We took appetizers but you shouldn't, just take entrees and split them, they're much cheaper and you get more food.Everything was amazing. Not a single dish I ""hated"". I would suggest taking ONLY the vegetarian or mostly vegetarian dishes because the King mushroom dish they had here, BLEW ME AWAY. I am going to come back for the other vegetarian plates because I had no idea how incredible they would be - well worth that money.ALL of it was good. The desserts, everything. Can't go wrong. I'd suggest the crab pasta as well as it was covered in crab-ness, and a rich, unctuous dish."

Located off of Ste. Catherine's in the Four Seasons Hotel it's a beautiful presentation. Gleaming, cool art, everyone and everything looks spotless. I was hoping to get brunch but we were too early so we had breakfast. The menu is good - very interesting items and traditional with a twist favorites. My dining partner got a very unique gravalax and beet sandwich. Very cool and I tried some of the salad and loved the dressing. I went with traditional scrambled eggs with bacon and smashed potatoes. Not sure what made them smashed as they were just potatoes. I also ordered a cinnamon bagel. The bagel was pretty disappointing. Very dry and didn't taste fresh. I tried the blueberry jam and clover honey but nothing could save it; I did like that the jam and honey were new and unopened on the table. I got a freshly squeezed orange juice that was perfect and the coffee was also very nice. The view is awesome. You get a great look at the city, especially the Leonard Cohen memorial on a building just across the way. Prices were a bit steep but I expected that. My only complaints would be the seasoning just wasn't there on anything I ate- while the eggs were so good (probably the best scrambled I've had) the entire dish was bland. I used the stylish yet not super efficient salt and pepper shakers more than I would have thought I'd need to, and the bagel just wasn't good at all. As a fan, I'd definitely return. Hopefully for either brunch or dinner next time."

The restaurant is outstandingly beautiful. From the light off white color with gold accessories and greenery surrounding shows you how this place belongs to upscale group of restaurant. Service is top notch. Everyone is super professional and really nice. Our server went to extra mile to take a nice picture of us. We ordered couple cup of lattes. Delicious! Then I had the avocado toast and my sister had NY to MTL toast (with sausage, biscuit and tomatoes). The food was average. After eating the dishes, I just didn't feel fully satisfied sadly. Personally, I had avocado toast at many places, and they were better than here. Maybe that particular dish was not my cup of tea. Maybe I should try something else next time. Due the beauty of the restaurant and the amazing service, I would like to come back, maybe for lunch or dinner."

If you order a dish with two listed ingredients one would expect both to show up at same time. Similarly tables sitting for half an hour with menus in front of them. Something logistically broke down. Was told on way out that very busy today but to be honest half the tables were empty. Came for breakfast but by the time we were asked what we wanted it changed to brunch menu.

The thing is nothing on the menu really inspired me. Turns out I do love it! I've tried the salmon tartare, the tuna tartare, the burger, the fried chicken sandwich, the fish of the day, the dessert of the day. Everything was flawless, from the surroundings to the service to the quality ingredients. Wonderful addition to the Montreal upscale restaurant scene."

They take you number and then you wait for their sales team to never call you back. On my third attempt to get in touch with someone they let me know that they wouldn't be taking large reservations till July. Understandably frustrated, I asked to make a reservation of 6 and 4...the person on the phone proceeded to tell me that I could, however they'd make sure that the tables would be separate. What an awful experience. I don't care how much food costs, or what my bill is going to be, I care that they made it practically impossible to spend my money there."
