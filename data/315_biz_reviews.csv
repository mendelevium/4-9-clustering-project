And finally...the smoked carrot eclair....who would have thought carrots would change a person's life.  Smoked to perfection, the ""mayo/cream"" with dill and tarragon (I believe) was so..so..so...good.   This is definitely a must order.For a restaurant that mainly focuses on seafood and veggies...wow..I'll definitely put this on my must go to places when I head back to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"***This is meant as a 3 1/2 star review***We came here on a Thursday for supper after much anticipation from my part as I heard so many good things about it from my friend. I was a little late so she waited at the bar and ordered a red wine. The bartender refused to give it to her saying she should go with a white wine instead because the menu that night was light. She said she would like a red wine. And again he refused. More than just a couple of times. I guess she is too nice because I would have walked out. Unless i specifically ASK for suggestions, I would like to have whatever I want please because last I checked, we were paying for it. Lol! (He finally gave her a red wine but not what she asked for)I'm a little late to the Vin Papillon party. The staff (minus the bartender) is nice, there's no reservation so u just gotta show up. The place is ""cluttery"" and cozy, definitely has that Joe Beef feel and is kinda noisy. We got the duck hearts with tahini & squash puree, the celeriac & smoked mushrooms and the rotisserie cauliflower. Everything tasted really good but quite oily. Would I go back? I'm not sure. I think I wouldn't line up for it. It was great, but there are other restaurants I wanna try before going back, just for a more general pleasant ambience."

/user_details?userid=3XCUFMlu7r6GLsyztGEg_A,Vincent A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I had not been to Vin Papillon for at least a couple years. The last time they mixed up our orders pretty bad, but I thought I'd give it another shot since I like the ambiance.This time, my wife and I were quite disappointed. We shared five small dishes. Perhaps we could have made a better selection, but the whole meal was extremely unidimensional, with overpowering vinegar and acidity that drowned out everything else. We were excited by the mushrooms, but could barely taste them.The wine selection was fun, and the service very nice, but this was still an underwhelming experience. Considering the price, I doubt we'll be back."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For the most part, we really enjoyed our experience here. Unlike Liverpool and Joe Beef, there are no reservations accepted so you must be prepared to wait for a table unless you like getting ready for dinner at 4:30pm and running out the door in time for the restaurant to open. After a 15 minute wait, they offered us 2 seats at the bar. Unfortunately that meant being packed like sardines elbow to elbow with the other cool kids. I can recall a beam of wood from the bar protruding into the void which would otherwise have occupied my left knee. The experiment lasted about 3 minutes before we informed the host that we would wait for an actual table. The wait took an additional 30 minutes which seemed to go by quite quickly given the attention we got from the sommelier. For better or worse, all Morin/McMillan restaurants play a little game with wine and spirits. You might think you are choosing what you want to drink. As soon as you say red wine or bubbles, they start in with the suggestions of something different but similar; all of which are very expensive. They bring you a bottle which you didn't choose and pour you a taste. Whatever they poured is inevitably delicious, rare, and has an elaborate backstory. If you want another glass or bottle, they tell you that they will bring you something else to try. I get it. They have a wine program. They are omniscient and we are lucky to breath the same rarified air as them. Sometimes however, I just want to choose a bottle myself, point to it on the menu, and have it poured for me...end of story. BTW, it's the same story with cocktails. You can never just get what you want.In terms of food, like their sister restaurants, they also suggest that you simply delegate all choices to them in the form of a tasting menu. Fortunately, they do allow you to order for yourself.We started with the little Burgundy ham. This was a letdown. It is essentially shavings of very mild and nearly tastless deli meat with shavings of what tasted like very mild cheddar cheese. The dish may have been sprinkled with some olive oil. It was very plain and overwhelmingly reminded me of what you might pull out of an elementary school lunch box.The next course was 5-6 pieces of snow crab with some cocktail sauce and aioli. The snow crab was fresh and chilled. We followed that with their smoked sturgeon spread served with large blackened (squid ink?) doughy pockets which they call fried gnocchi. The fish spread was truly spectacular. The ""gnocchi"" was weird and added little to the experience aside from a delivery system for the smoked fish.We tried their mozzarella which is served without any bread. It was a fairly small ball of cheese covered in oil and peas. This was as tasty as any other buffalo mozzarella found elsewhere. I would pass this up for something a tad more inventive next time.The next dish was their shrimp toast which is essentially a large piece of grilled brioche bread topped with a good portion of small shrimp. They claimed it was seasoned with old bay, but I tasted none. If you've spent any time in Florida, you understand what shrimp tossed in old bay is supposed to taste like. Not to say that this dish wasn't delicious. The crunchy and buttery bread combined with the fresh shrimp was delicious. It could have also used a squeeze of lemon.The carrot eclair was spectacular as advertised. It had the appearance of smoked salmon and didn't taste all that different. The fresh cream, dill, and bright orange smoked carrot ribbons are spectacular when combined. It was absolutely delicious. I wish I had ordered the cauliflower as I understand it is their specialty. Nevertheless, for a carnivore such as myself, I can only revel in light and airy dishes for so long before my need for some meat requires servicing; Enter the rabbit sausage brochette served on a metal spear with a fleur- de-lis. Reminiscent of an Indian sheek kabob, this brochette was very moist and well seasoned. It was served with a generous cucumber salad which paired well with the salty meat. For dessert, like the other 2 adjacent restaurants, Vin Papillon excels in creating the most delicious soft serve ice cream creations. I think it was strawberry rhubarb with some sort of crumble. Each time I have one of these desserts, I feel like I am eating the greatest soft serve ever prepared on a hot summer day in Montreal circa 1971. I can picture the air smelling cleaner, outdoor colours are more vivid, John Lennon is still alive, Led Zeppelin is still a band, the music industry is alive and well, and the Habs seem to win the cup every year. A lot of imagery for one dessert, but they manage to evoke it every time.We also had the chocolate tart which was pedestrian (as are most desserts compared to their ice cream creations.) Ultimately, because of the wine, it was a pricey night. I still prefer the other two restaurants, but am glad I finally got to try this one."
/user_details?userid=e0AUdCu-jeOkLImiEzlTDg,Jonathan W.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"The evening I visited Le Vin Papillon is a perfect example that sometimes, when things don't go according to plan, it can be for the good. Our group's original plans didn't involve coming to Le Vin Papillon or even being in the neighborhood to begin with, but we ended up being around the area with some time to kill before next planned event. The fact that Le Vin Papillon doesn't take reservations played out in our favour I think as we were able to get a table with little wait, though the place was quite busy. It is a sister restaurant to Joe Beef, and as with Joe Beef, there are no printed menus, but they list the items available on a chalkboard (French only). It seems as though there are mainstays with their menu however, as some of the things we eventually ordered are seen here on this page in other reviews and photos posted. In terms of the menu, the waiters are happy to explain the items to you in English with no issue and provide their recommendations. In fact, we did ask our waiter for some recommendations and we're glad we did.The first item to arrive was smoked sturgeon with gnocchi fritti. Forget anything you associate with gnocchi when ordering this dish. What arrives if largely a conduit to eating the (incredible) sturgeon. The fried gnocchi is almost has almost a bread-like texture that is about a 3"" square that is puffed and almost entirely hollow. Effectively, you cut it open and stuff it with the sturgeon to eat. It's hard to describe the sturgeon. There's not a particularly strong taste and even the smoke is subtle, but somehow it was one of the best bites of my trip and really compared to anywhere else. I've still be thinking about it a week later now.The smoked carrot eclair was was another dish that unexpectedly thrilled. They pulled off the eclair as expected, but I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the smoked carrot and the 'mayo' on it which to me tasted more like a creme fraiche. A carrot eclair might be a hard sell if I just tried to describe it on my own, but do yourself a favour by just trusting me and ordering it if it's on the menu. This dish would be a prime example of how vegetarians don't have to miss out either on exceptional food.The roasted cauliflower in brown butter was decadent and surprisingly a quite a bit acidic - probably because I didn't pay enough attention to the menu. It was wonderful, but probably something you'd want to share rather than eat on your own.Easy to say that I was thrilled with my whole experience here. It was a bit ironic for a food trip that had a planned itinerary, the one place we stopped into unexpectedly ended up being my favorite. A repeat visit is no doubt necessary as I'd plan on trying more food and making a it a larger meal."
/user_details?userid=YEDnTf7d6RyXKEHDGqi9tg,Sume D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Not really sure why I'm writing this review because I will just repeat what everyone is saying. Vin Papillon is a gem. Swung by with a group of friends an hour before our Joe Beef reservation for a quick drink. Turns out we had to order food with drinks - something to do with licensing laws. In any case, I am so so glad that we did because everything from food to service to wine was fantastic. We were seated immediately, which is surprising for a group of 5 on a Friday night. Guess it was meant to be. They don't have menus, everything is written up on the board. From where we were sitting it was a little hard to see so with the help of our server and Yelp we settled on the smoked sturgeon with gnocchi fritti infused with squid ink, roasted cauliflower with brown butter, and smoked carrot eclair. Everything was phenomenal. The sturgeon was my favourite and the carrot eclair was a surprise favourite since I don't like carrots much. Our server made a few recommendations for the wine, all of them great. Definitely planning on returning and spending a lot more time here than just an hour. I think we did pretty well though!"

/user_details?userid=CxDOIDnH8gp9KXzpBHJYXw,Jennifer K.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Le Vin Papillon was not my first choice. I really want to take my friend to Joe Beef but could not get a reservation. How can a restaurant that has a menu focus on seafood and vegetable satisfy my meat loving friends?!Le Vin Papillon has no reservation policy. Best to arrive early! Arriving before 5 pm would guarantee a table if you are a small group. This is a more intimate restaurant with limited seating, especially during winter when the back patio is not available. Make sure everyone in your party here on time as you won't be seated till then!Our friends arrived late and we ended up having a drink at the bar. I would have just have my dinner at the bar area as the bartender is super friendly and cheerful and I can just order all their regular menu. If you are a wine lover, you won't be disappointed with their wine selection.Everything on the menu is EXCELLENT! Their waitstaff just AMAZING! We ended up doing a ""Trust your waitstaff"" style. The ""famous"" Cauliflower with chicken skin and the Smoked Carrot Eclair were just amazing! Vegetable dishes for the meat lovers. Duck Fat, Chicken Skin, Bacon Fat were used to add flavour to all the dish. Interesting flavour, texture and definitely not what my friend expected!Our waiter ask if we want some more?? Of course YES!Celery Root? I was doubtful but now I am a believer! Perfectly seasoned Beef Tartar hidden underneath some greens? Sturgeon with Squid Ink Puff Bread?Our waiter asked if I want more? I do but sadly my friends said they were fullI have now been to all 3 chef Marc-Olivier Frappier's restaurants in Montreal. They are all consistent in service and food quality. The price point is quite affordable for what they offers. But Le Vin Papillon's offerings is just so unique and great for seafood lover like myself. Now I do have a second thought about Joe Beef being my favourite restaurant in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=tOjRIW2n3bhTtwmGclCHcw,Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place on a Saturday evening after a long day of walking around Montreal because we were looking for an interesting wine bar. We did not expect to eat, but then we came to our senses and had the most wonderful evening filled with delicious food and wine. The focus here is on ""natural"" wines, functionally what this means is that they are prioritizing sourcing no/low-sulfur added wines. Honestly, I don't think it's super useful to say ""natural"" wine because that's not a defined category, different producers are going to have vastly different answers about why their wine is ""natural"". That's said, as a group of 4 we went through about (at some point I lost count) 4 bottles here (don't worry, we were eating) and each one was lovely. We focused on recommendations by the staff and he did a really good job creating a progression of wines to go with our meal and stick with the ""mood"" of the group. Every wine we tried was well made, good balance of acid/flavors/etc. and no super weird ""flaws"" that have lately became very popular in the wine world - not that there is anything wrong with drinking wine that's reminiscent of kombucha if that's your thing, but it's just not what we were going for.  The staff here is knowledgeable about what they sell, use that knowledge to have them recommend something for your taste, you won't regret it. Food wise, we let the waiter craft a menu for us to be eaten family style as well and it was the perfect amount of food and everything was so fresh and tasty. We started with a seafood spread (crab legs, sea urchin, razor clams, and smoked sturgeon w/ fried gnocchi which was my fave) because it was local and in season, then followed up with a vegetable course (if they have the carrot eclair when you are there GET IT. GET TWO. GET AS MANY AS THEY WILL SELL YOU, it is one of the best things I've ever eaten ever) we also got cauliflower with lentils and a small skirt steak. For dessert we shared the carrot cake sundae and ricotta fritters. The sundae was the winner but everything was delicious. This meal is honestly one of the best meals I've had in a long time overall, and was my favorite while in Montreal by leaps and bounds, I would definitely come back here if I find myself visiting the city again."

Although tiny and there is always a waitlist, it is most definitely worth the wait!The staff are very well trained and very knowledgeable of both the menu and the wine list. We tried as many dishes as we could and could not find any faults in any of them and their wine selection is to die for.Will be back again for sure!"
/user_details?userid=hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw,Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",5 star rating,"No reservations here at Le Vin Papillon but I arrived before the dinner rush started and so I didn't have too long to wait until a single stool opened up at the bar where I had terrific service.I let the waiter make recommendations because the big chalkboard was in French and while some things are close enough to English that I can mostly fake it, I was at a complete loss here. So maybe I got up sold to more expensive dishes. No worries, they were fab.A great glass of French red to start with and for some reason, I was offered seafood to go with it. Okay, I rolled. An order of crab legs, which were messy but well cracked so that I mostly just had to dig out the meat. It came with a small pot of clotted cream, which probably made sense to the head chef but not to me. I enjoyed it anyway. Second dish was a sea urchin, which I'd never had before and it was quite tasty and fresh.Not cheap, but I did have the advantage of a strong US dollar that made it reasonable.Great service and a super restaurant. Definitely date worthy, other than you might be waiting a bit for your table. Head across the street to the Burgundy Lion for a drink while you wait!"
/user_details?userid=gEYepBYm2gtWGO7QwDA3Ag,Chris J.,"Tacoma, WA",5 star rating,"Associated with joe Beef, tapa sized plates and a diverse, deep wine list are hallmarks at vin papillon. Eight of us sat outside, arrive early if you're more than four, and just instructed the server to just bring a bit of everything. My companions are a bit adventurous with food, but don't know French cooking, and don't speak French. So they were fine to just have chefs choices as it were. Highlights were the raw scallops, seaweed gnocchi and baby clams. Wines are all natural wines, we enjoyed a Loire white and a red in bottles. Then a couple of us had orange wine with our desserts. Single diners can enjoy the bar and mingle with other guests and the bartender."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This was my second time at this resto. The first time I went I was lucky enough not to wait in line. The cauliflower and the cheese platter with the wine pairing really stuck with me. I was excited to go back and bring my boyfriend. This time I went on a Friday night at around 9 pm. This place does not take reservations. It's first come, first served. We had to wait thirty minutes which is exactly the time they told us we would have to wait when we walked in. We drank wine while we waited so the wait wasn't that bad. We got the jambon de la petite bourgogne to start. It's a simple plate of sliced ham with cheese but omg this was my favourite dish of the night!! It was amazing! Then we got the fried chicken. I liked it because it was not greasy and it was so juicy. It had a bit of a lemony taste to it but not strong enough to bother me. The side of brocoli and jalapeño purée was not that great because it really was a bit too lemony for my liking. Next we shared the the beef tartare sandwich. I was really excited to try this sandwich but I was disappointed. I love beef tartare. This one was supposed to have foie gras but I couldn't even taste it because the tartare was mixed with mustard and pickles. I really don't like mustard. It was Dijon mustard. I love pickles though so that didn't bother me. It was a bit overpowering though. I would have liked to be able to taste the actual beef tartare without the overpowering mustard and pickles. The roasted cauliflower was just as good as I remembered it. It was very flavourful. I liked the fried pieces of chicken all over the cauliflower. It's a staple on the menu. Lastly we had the cheese platter. There were twelve cheeses to choose from but I didn't know which ones to choose from so I told the waiter to choose the best three. They were all from Quebec. Two were hard cheeses and strong like cheddar and the third was soft and tasted oddly enough like bubblegum but in a good way. What blew my mind was not the cheese though. It was the bread! Omg this was the best bread I ever had. It had sesame seeds on it and was super flavourful. It comes from a bakery in the Mile end apparently. We were so full so we brought the rest of the bread home to have with our supper the next day. I would definitely recommend this place. The food is good and the wines are good. Although I must say that I enjoyed the wines I had more the first time I went."

In addition to some spectacular seafood to help the veges go down smooth.  May I ask you, what have you been smoking?!  CARROT! Nope, that's neither a fancy name for something you roll up nor a new cut of meat.  It's the orange stick thingy, but here they call it Carrot Eclair.CAULIFLOWER. I think I spelled it correctly since I haven't seen it, written it, or tasted it for the past 20 years but either Le Vin Papillon grew a new breed of savoury califlower or I don't remember how it tasted like but I was completely overwhelmed by the Roasted Cauliflour with bits and pieces of chicken.I think Le Vin Papillon may make veges taste so good that it can finally be it's own food group."

We were only in Montreal for one night-this place came highly recommended to us from friends in the wine business, and it was exactly what I wanted.Our server figured out exactly how we roll right away. We're big natural wine fans, first off. But what I really love is when we get a server who knows their wine and food inside out and does not hesitate to give recommendations- our server was pouring bubbly for me to try thirty seconds into our conversation.Because of the chalkboard menu setup and our location on the opposite end of the bar, we let our server take it over for the evening with both our wine and our food. It was all excellent. Food, wine, and service. I might dream about the carrot eclair and the cauliflower. I love when restaurants blow my mind with vegetables; I think it really says something for the chef when they can take the most stalwart of root vegetables and turn it into something amazing.Wine was perfect and right up my alley. Service was great- just enough attention without being too much.This was my ideal restaurant experience-highly, highly recommended. We live in Vermont a couple of hours away and will absolutely be back."

The menu is only available on a chalk board which, though visible from everywhere inside, cant be seen from the backyard terrace where we chose to sit. We werent warned about this and went inside to take pictures of the menu to consult on our phones, which I didn't particularly enjoy. The menu is all small plates which my partner and I love but we like to order as we go and unfortunately we recieved hardly any service at all. Our waiter promptly offered us wine when we sat down but we had to flag him down every time we wanted to order a dish, which became very frustrating as we ordered 6 courses.The food and wine were definitely great but not good enough to make up for the fact that our server spent more time chatting with his collegues than offering us any kind of service.I was so excited to come here to celebrate a couple of milestones but I wish this experience had been better as I am sure this isnt the norm."

Even though we were stuffed from dinner, we decided to walk over to Le Vin Papillon to grab a drink. This is the third restaurant of the Joe Beef empire (their other spot is Liverpool House) and they're thriving on all fronts. Love the outside decor.The moment you walk in, you're greeted to the loveliest meat slicer. The inside is warm, inviting and ambient. There's no other way to put it but cozy and intimate. Took a peek at their backyard terrace. Gorgeous and packed to the brim. It was a perfect night to sit outside and enjoy. Those Christmas-esque lights are adorable.No real menus here. Everything is handwritten on their massive chalkboards. Same thing for their drinks menu; wine, beers and ciders. LVP only has a partial license so you have to order at least one plate (but only one) if you're drinking. There was only spots at the bar so we snagged the last two chairs.- Rosee ($11.00 each) - the rose was just like our bartender described it; light, summery and very drinkable.- Chocolate tartan ($12.00) - our dessert that we ""shared"" but more like I ate it because Cbear couldn't fathom eating anymore. The chocolate tartin was palatable. Hard and crusty on the bottom, lighter on top with fresh strawberries and raspberries.Cool spot to grab a drink before or after dinner. Our neighbours were drinking here before their lateeee dinner reservations at Joe Beef. I'll have to check out their backyard terrace next time."

Some sort of Celery Fritter which was amazingly light, topped with grated cheese....sounds quite horrible, but this was like eating perfectly seasoned clouds!!

I was really bummed that there was so much traffic/border crossing delay that we couldnt make our Liverpool reservation but we decided to try this place since it was just before 6:30 on a Saturday and luckily there was no wait. When we left there was a huge wait so definitely go early. Our server was really friendly and helpful since their menu is really annoying (on a chalkboard that we all had to walk over to read because we were in the window seat) and also in French. We ordered a bunch of dishes and one of our favorites was the thinly sliced ham plate with brown butter and cheese. Wow - didn't think I'd love non-prosciutto ham so much. We also had a smoked fish dish that my sister loved, and a roasted cauliflower dish. I am ambivalent to roasted cauliflower but one of our friends liked it a lot. The smoked carrots pastrami was very interesting - not something I feel compelled to order again but definitely worth trying. The one kind of disappointing dish was the beef tongue, which was not as tender as we had hoped.If I'm ever back in Montreal I would definitely want to try more of the Joe Beef restaurants."

I probably shouldn't be saying this, but if you show up early or late in the evening there is a rarely a wait for a table.I think that the food and atmosphere are terrific. They have a really nice terrace in the back where they have a charcoal BBQ. The menu is written on a chalkboard by the front door and is updated regularly (I've uploaded a pic of a recent version). Dishes are small tapas style offerings, great for sharing with friends. Some of my favorites from recent visits include the grilled calamari, the Spanish style toast with tomatoes & muscles and the corn profiteroles. Special mention go to the profiteroles as they are a truly unique dish. They really mean it when they say corn. They are made with corn flour, topped with popcorn and what I think is some sort of a corn syrup based sauce. The taste of corn is very strong and unique, much less sweet than you would expect. Even if you don't enjoy the corniness, you will certainly appreciate the unique flavour that has been created. Oh, and of course there is a great wine list."

/user_details?userid=3MMTwPtpiMlBDe-p07XK9A,Tresna L.,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,Le Vin was one of the dining highlites of my trip to Montreal. Gorgeous and professional staff serve up an array of excellent wines that must be enjoyed with a plate of food (it's part of their license apparently). Not that having to purchase food is a hardship! The assortment of small and large sharing plates are delicious. We drank dry white wine in the sunshine with a bowl of shrimp (or prawns as we call them down under) and then popped next door for dinner.I'd only wished I had weeks to spend in Montreal so I could visit Le Vin on a number of occasions and enjoy more of their menu.

The menu constantly changes so there's always novelty, and service is always 5 stars in my books.We ordered a bottle of VDF Anjou Melodie en Sous-sol by Jerome Lambert (white wine), and it was nothing like what we've tasted before. Rather on the sweet side, but just dry enough to hit the spot. I may be wrong, but i dont think any of their wines can be found in the SAQ. The past few times we've been, none of the bottles had sulfite in it, and you really taste the difference.Considering that the food changes often, it's rather irrelevant for me to describe my appreciation for them. There are only 3/5 dishes that we ordered that i'd comment on:- celeri rave homard: we took it for the lobster description, but it's not at all what it seems; i'd give it 3/5- betteraves bottarga: it was awesome! Such simple ingredients, but made delicious. 4/5- saving the best for last: esturgon fumé, gnocchi fritti. This dish was off the hook, gnocchi being a kind of light bread. 5/5Vin Papillon is always a pleasant experience, and service is always very elegant, polite, on point, and feeling all Gucci."

It's a tapas menu so I came here as my second ""afternoon snack."" I had a plate of raw beef, cucumber, cilantro, and Greek yogurt. While I'm not a fan of cilantro, somehow this dish was so beautifully put together that the flavours just worked and you could tell it was high quality beef. I also ordered the famous smoked carrot eclair and my.god. this was one of the most unique things I have ever tasted! The smoked carrot almost tasted like smoked salmon/ham and was cooked to the perfect texture. While I believe the carrot is suppose to be the main attraction of the dish, the eclair REALLY blew me away. It's extremely had to find a good eclair and this one was lightly crispy on the outside and deliciously moist on the inside. Took me right back to my favourite ones in Paris.

Our waitress was very helpful and ended up choosing for us since we couldn't see the damn chalk board menu. The food felt healthy but impressively tasty and paired perfectly with the wines which were all so fresh and lively. It is a bit expensive, and the food is in small plates to share. It might be a better option for lunch or just before a show like us than for a full diner as it can get pricey in the end. There was a good diversity in the choices even if they were limited and all very creative.My favorite part was at the end, we took a cheese plate.

The counters are piled with fresh homemade bread and beautiful cheese wheels under glass domes. Take a photo of the blackboards on your way in to read at your seat and leisure, one is entirely delicious food and the other is wine by the bottle, but really based on my experience your best bet is just chatting with the amazing wait staff about what you feel like eating and what they are excited to be serving that night and you won't be led astray.

Their best dishes are the ones featuring a roasted veggie. **Rotisserie Cauliflower (one of the best veggie dishes I've had) **chicken wings (delicious) **Eggplant dip **Jambon (least favorite, too basic) **Stuffed plums (my husband really enjoyed them) Really great atmosphere, good quality food. Prices were a little high end, especially for the wine glasses."

I ate a lot of great food in Montreal, but this was about as good as any meal I had there and maybe anywhere, including its big brother Joe Beef.I had one glass of orange wine along with the amazing ham and cheese plate with brown butter and cracked pepper.  The ham is smokey and meaty, the cheese is sharp and the brown butter ties it all into a fucking amazing plate of food. I wish I could eat this every day. I followed with clams stuffed with pancetta breadcrumbs and aioli, which are beautiful and also quite delicious.  This was followed by the Ruttabaga schnitzel, topped with a poached egg and a small fillet of Mackerel. An excellent dish, I only wish I could've had a runnier poached egg or perhaps some uni as I've seen in images of other diners.I finished with a gamay, my favorite red. Fruity, funky and very drinkable, along with a spicy lamb tartare. A nice spark and simmer to go with the rich cylinder of lamb.Service was a lil pretentious, not as great as the amazing service we received during a decadent dinner at Joe Beef. But I was clearly a tourist, plus I live in Brooklyn so I'm not too phased by it. A must for anyone serious about food during a visit to Montreal. I hope to be back soon!"

Great atmosphere and vibe, food is great.No reservation policy but we arrived at 6:30 so we're seated rather fast. Very intimate seating. Plates are small and meant for sharing - we were a group of 5 and asked the waiter to bring us 2-3 dishes at a time varying from seafood to veggies and finished with chicken. Great selection, the waiter really served us well and made sure we weren't full before bringing more plates.  Bill was very reasonable 30-35 dollars/person with tip!"

The food was amazing, small plates full of taste. Perfect for the wine bar ambiance also.Finally, the dessert were delicious and in a good size. Perfect to share if you wish.I give 3 stars instead of 4, not for the food, but I feel it was a bit expensive.

The food was perfect. We had roasted carrots with burrata, which I loved not just because the cheese was somehow better than ever, but also because I think it's an insult to burrata to pair it with tomatoes and balsamic. The flavours and textures played perfectly in this dish. We tried BBQ'd clams, caesar-inspired chicken wings with anchovies, parmesan, and lemon, and a head of cauliflower with lardons that blew my mind. We even pushed through and ordered dessert, and it was worth it. Four dishes and two desserts for two very hungry girls pushed the limits of our appetites, so I would suggest bringing more people so you can try more stuff, because everything was super yummy.But the standout was the service. Kaitlin was our sommelier/server and she was bubbly, sweet, and super knowledgeable. She guided us through their by-the-glass options (which I recommend because they have lots of incredible wines and you'll want to try more than one!) and found wines to suit both of our tastes. She was friendly and present without being too much a part of our date, and it was so appreciated. Even if the food had been just-ok, I would go back for the service.Update: I have since been back to VP three times, and the service is still standout, and the food, impossibly, seems to be even better. Last night we were lucky enough to be looked after by Robin and Kris, and we didn't want to leave... Could have stayed there all night with the super staff!"

This was 4pm, so we weren't really hungry - she suggested the most expensive food and just like that $70 when we just wanted 2 glasses of wine.

/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A night of absolute perfection, with just one minor imperfection. Let me explain why!Le Vin Papillion is owned by David McMillan who is also the same owner as Joe Beef. Which happens to be one of the most known and best rated restaurants both in Montreal, and Canada. Having that in mind, I had full confidence that my stomach I are were mostly likely going to be very pleased. Indeed we were!Upon walking in at 5:30pm on A Saturday evening, I was thrilled to see that I could sit in a table for two right away. I do strongly advice all of you that you go early, since space is limited and it gets full fast. Real fast!While waiting for a friend of mine to arrive, I had the time to observe and analyze the ambiance and atmosphere. It took me about two minutes to realize that I was falling in love with the place already. I know, dinner was not served, yet!  However the lights were dimmer, the restaurant was cozy, and warm along with a lovely, light smell of a woodsy indoor grill. With a perfect view of the open kitchen. Which gives you a good glimpse of their hard, dedicated, and talented kitchen staff.  Within a minute a very kind, and polite waiter was kind enough to offer me something to drink while waiting for my friend. Also asking me if I needed anything and if my table was alright for me. Luckily all those questions had a positive answer of mine. Which made me think, Wow! the service here is spectacular within minutes of walking in. Sadly, I can't say the same thing about many other restaurants I've been to. Five minutes later now that my friend had arrived(We were a table of two) Time to talk and discuss what shall we order? We've decided to order a few difference different dishes, in order to have a taste of many of their dishes.  Now this is the moment where I will mention the one, and only imperfection I did not enjoy about our dinner experience. When it came time to look at their menu, we were told to go and look at the blackboard, and take a photo of it with our smartphones. Indeed it's a different concept than most restaurants, but a slightly impractical concept as well.  While the menu items were written in a lovely font, it's a clear font. Along with the dimmed lights, it didn't make it any easier to read. The small light that illuminated the blackboard, was bright enough only to illuminate a small section of the blackboard, not the entire thing. The blackboard is situated in a bit of an backward position nearby the tables. So if people are sitting there or standing there, you will need to ask them to move. If you are sitting by the kitchen as we were, you will need to stand up and go read the blackboard in the traffic of the waiters/waitress.Now that I'm standing, and looking at their menu, it's a very helpful thing that I have a strong knowledge of foods, and ingredients. As the menu does not have a description of the ingredients or what each item is. They are simply written with a name. That's it. Therefore if you are unfamiliar with the names or what each item is, you will need to be given a verbal explanation and remember them. A true challenge, but worth it. Now that we are walking back to our table with a photo of the menu in our smartphone, let's investigate the choices and choose. We began by ordering four different dishes. Sliced cooked ham from La Petite Bourgogne. Along with shavings of a very delicious, flavorful, and wonderful texture cheese. Oh my.. Oh my! We simply didn't talk for about 10 minutes while we were madly in love with this dish. This is just the beginning!We also decided to try the ""Champignons Champignons"" Yes, that literally translates to mushrooms, mushrooms"" So we asked for a brief explanation. They were delicate, extremely flavorful, and juicy small caps of mushrooms with an outstanding stuffing inside.  Another ""WOW"" of a dish. Now to the more original, and unique dishes.  A sturgeon(fish) pâté with a lovely smoked paprika oil, and creamy as can be. Served along side of friend gnocchi. I already said wow to the previous dishes.. But.. WOW again! To add a bit of a different twist, we've decided to order the roasted cauliflower. Hmmmm we were feeling so so about this dish. The combination of pickled raw onions, with the warm but crunchy cauliflower. It was just ""OK"" Not a wow factor but not a complete failure either. The dessert... Chocolate perfection in every bite. A tender buttery crust, filled with an outstanding dark chocolate filling flavored with bergamot, which is a citrus fruit quite similar to an orange but with a more floral taste and less sour. An absolute perfect flavour to pair it with chocolate. Finished by fresh whipped cream and a light sprinkle of chocolate. We had moments of silence, moments of goosebumps, and perhaps a slight orgasm here and there? Clearly the dinner did it's job beautifully. We can't wait to go back again, and again. Bravo to David McMillan, and his entire Vin Papillion staff for an outstanding dinner!"

/user_details?userid=awlLz4kcnWQ227clWnQT6g,Grant H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We visited Le Vin Papillon on a whim while visiting Montreal for a wedding. The place was packed when we showed up, but we got a table fairly quickly for a Saturday night. The space is fairly small, but with a large patio out back, and gorgeously decorated. The menu is written on a chalkboard near the front, so prepare to bother someone with your phone to take a picture if you're not sitting under it. The restaurant seems to emphasize roasted and seasoned vegetables, tasty things piled on top of bread, and uniquely prepared meats - we had chicken wings that were served in a particularly flavourful vinegar-like soup. Because we were a group of 5, it made splitting the dishes a bit awkward, so I would probably recommend the place more for couples who aren't fussy about getting messy at the table. And who aren't on a first date. My only trouble with the place was their wine program, which really should be reworked a little more carefully, considering this is a wine-focused restaurant. Le Vin Papillon definitely seems on board with the current trend of featuring natural or biodynamic wines from lesser-known or overlooked French appellations, orange wines from Italy and other obscure bottles. While this in itself is good, lists where little is familiar to the usual drinker need a good server to guide customers to the right choice. Since the cheapest bottle on the 30-some list was $40 (marked up from $15 at retail), whatever you're ordering needs to be well-considered. Unfortunately, the place is too loud and the servers too flat out to really help in the matter, so I resorted to Wikipedia. Similarly, their glass program is limited and seems to change frequently. I ordered a second glass of Chenin Blanc after our table's bottle ran dry. When the bill came, it was revealed to be $18 for a 3-ounce pour. Had I stupidly ordered two glasses, I might as well have bought the whole bottle at the store. Seeing as you might want multiple glasses of wine (rather than one catch-all bottle) to go with the various dishes you order, a $8-$14 10-wine by-the-glass list would make much more sense. Overall, the service was swift and to the point, if a little grumpy. It's definitely worth stopping into, if you're from/dropping into Montreal, but you'd best start drinking before you get to the restaurant until they shape up their wine program."

There is enough variety here to keep you coming back since menu options change all the time. Of course mainstays like cheese, pickles, nuts and bread will always be around but why not try lesser-known items like the lettuce with Bottarga (i.e shaving of salty fish eggs which the Sardinians go crazy for)? I did yesterday and it was fabulous and now I'm a convert.Also don't skip on dessert. We tried the Paris-Brest and it was easily one of the best I've had. They got the puff pastry and cream right down to the right consistency.The real ""star"" here of course is the variety of wines. With two giant blackboards with white and red selections, you're bound to find something you like. Montreal needs more wine and snack bars catering to more sophisticated palates with such reasonable prices.

Le Vin Papillon does serve meat (and seafood of course) but offers a large variety of veggie dishes and yummy cheeses for those who aren't into eating animals, and most of these veggie options are not just incredibly original (like celery root carpaccio) but totally delicious as well.Their wine selection is pretty good too plus they have quite a few to choose from by the glass so you won't be disappointed there.They don't take reservations and there is usually a considerable wait at the door but it's well worth it. The food is yummy and the space is pretty (plus the lighting is muy romantic for a date).I would suggest trying this spot out if you are a small group (2 to 4 people max) and going a little bit before you are so starving you could eat the east side of a west bound skunk. Once you get there, you might want to order a glass of wine to sip while you are standing around and maybe even try the smoked eggplant caviar app. It's easy to share and eat on your feet."

The 6 of us were seated in a far corner and couldnt see much of the menu ( oh, so the menu is all written on the walls with chalk!! No handouts period...) We were all a bit skeptical at first not knowing how to proceed. The person waiting on us was quite smug and almost condescending in the beginning... Let's jus say he was snobbish about his restaurant.  But as mentioned in another review, he went on to narrate our meal for the evening. Once he got talking, he mellowed down and got more friendly. The recommendations were epic. The food is essentially tapas style... So u order a large variety of small quantities.. We had their take on chicken wings, mushroom and potatoes from the grill, a radish with special butter combo, some pic cauliflower from the grill, amazing red wines and some epic deserts... The amount of though put into the selection of flavors is mind boggling. Everything tasted amazing, and was their take on some traditional dish at times. Its a great place for date night."

Straight from the mirrors to the banquettes to the layout of the restaurant. Paris, Paris, Paris. In the very best way. Everyone knows Dave and Fred of Joe Beef but you really need to know Vanya and Marco. Just lovely folks who really care about food, service and people. FOOD I HATE Cauliflower. Capital letters H A T E. Where is the nutritional value? It's white? It looks disgusting. It's spraypainted broccoli (another childhood repulsion but at least it has nutritional value). Vin Papillon's touch with fried chicken bits and fat drizziling over the cauliflower made me a believer. So any chef that can turn a food you hate into a food you like is the mark of a true chef. I had the pickled plate. It was nice but I think I was expecting more pickles and less of a veg medley. Maybe I was lost in translation? It's filling if you do get it. Rum soaked baba will make you drunk and the wine gums (with wine!) are delicious. Basically the menu is date friendly and it really is a great date place and of course, with lovely natural wines. A nicer, lighter version of Joe Beef fare. Joe Beef lite? OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Floats like a butterfly but doesn't sting like a bee. Def. in the top favourite restaurants of Montreal list."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The Joe Beef guys opened a wine bar. That was pretty much all that I needed to hear. It took just over a month after its opening but I headed down to the corner of Charlevoix and Notre-Dame (which at this point is probably my most visited street block in the city outside of the Jean Talon Market and my own apartment) with a friend for a little early weekend dinner.The first thing you notice when you walk in is the visual differences between it and its brethren. No crazy or folksy paraphernalia on the walls. A very clean and elegant look with white brick, white tiles, wood tables and black leather. The entire right side of the narrow space is a beautiful bar where all the prep work is done. There is also a small relatively sparse terrasse in the back with communal tables. Overall, there is a sleeker look in keeping with a wine bar but once you add the blackboard menus and the alternative music, it keeps that Joe Beef/Liverpool House feel that I love.Like its brethren, Le Vin Papillon has no set menu on paper. When you enter, there is one blackboard with the day's menu listed as well as a couple that list the wine choices they have by the bottle. Surprisingly enough for a wine bar concept, they don't have very many selections by the glass. It is almost all by the bottle. The wines were mostly French and Italian from my browsing of the choices. The wines I tried were selected by our waiter because, to be honest, I have a complete lack of knowledge of wine outside of California so I figured he would be in a better place to provide me a good glass. Both were quite good but I won't go into details here. I'll stick to the food. The menu is very interesting in that it is very light on meats which is really separates it from both other restaurants. The dishes are mainly vegetables based and are very much dishes design to accompany wine and share amongst your dining party.First up, we went with the haricots-coco-romano. Local quebec green beans with some prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, romano cheese and beans tossed in some olive oil. As will be a pretty consistent theme through the meal, this plate was a great showcase of local produce with a few augments to enhance and up the flavours. The sun-dried tomatoes and the romano were nice pairings with the crisp green beans. The olive oil allowed all the ingredients to blend nicely.We followed that up with a selection of their cheeses of the day. Again, we left the choices up to the staff with the caveat of no blue cheese (still not a favorite of mine by itself). We got 3 out of the 7 they were offering that day. Great selection by the staff as they mixed up the texture and the tastes nicely. With the cheese, we got a plate of toasted artisan loaf bread with butter as well as fresh nuts to crack and enjoy. Loved the bread - thank god they didn't leave a basket at the table during the whole meal because I wouldn't have stopped eating it. As from the nuts, I love the idea but the practice of cracking them at the table is a little messier than is ideal. Next up, we went with the roasted onion and ricotta cheese. Just a great dish and a kind of item pairing that in hindsight I wished I had thought up sooner. Fresh creamy ricotta cheese with a beautifully roasted sweet onion and some more of that bread. Absolutely no complaints here.The final dish of our first selection was the chicken wings with tarragon. Nice flavours here and the wings were cooked as they should be, however I feel this was the least successful dish but only because of the impractically of eating wings at a wine bar. A little too messy and sticky to enjoy with a glass of wine even when trying to eat them neatly.   Still somewhat hungry, we decided to order a couple of more plats. First up this time, their rotisserie Cauliflower. Yeah, that's right. This dish was by far the most unique thing we had this evening. Roasted cauliflower with thyme, crispy chicken skin, candied lemon peels and a spicy oil mixture on top. A surprisingly spicy dish but one with great texture and crunch from the roasted cauliflower and the chicken skin. Very enjoyable.We then went with our waiter's suggestion of the vinegar eggplant. Roasted eggplants topped with a tomato/almond mixture, some melted cheese, some fresh basil and of course, as the name implies, vinegar. Nice earthy flavours throughout with the sweetness of the tomatoes, the richness of the cheese and the acidity of the vinegar mixed in. A surprisingly filling dish on top of all that. Very well done.To finish the whole thing off, I went with a homemade chocolate truffle with some fresh blueberries. Rich creamy chocolate interior coated with some crushed pistachios for a little nutty crunch. Perfectly done and the perfect sweet touch to cap off the meal.Overall, a very nicely executed wine bar concept and one with a menu that surprises with its emphasis on vegetables. A few dishes and some wine glasses later, you leave stuffed and quite satisfied."

/user_details?userid=38GD8xX6oWru1Ro5pFqmVg,Mark D.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,"As I was on vacation, I first tried Joe Beef and Liverpool house to see if I could score a seat for one as a walk in. I found myself seated at the end of the bar at Le Vin Papillon. The beginning of an excellent night. I was plied with excellent wines I had never had, some I liked, some I didn't, some I was not sure of, but all new. I was hosted by many, but primally by a beautiful young woman born of equal parts sass and seduction. I had excellent conversation with my fellow bar dwellers until the place closed and the staff invited this middle aged fat man for drinks at a bar I honestly cannot recall. the food was excellent, the company lively and the beautiful young barmaid rebuffed my repeated offers of marriage."

/user_details?userid=zRg3raGBZDeNeHs8R1qdwg,Diana S.,"Lincoln, NH",1 star rating,"I have to say that the reviews made us want to try this place but it was impossible. My husband, daughter and I went there and we were showed to a table so tiny that made it impossible for the 3 of us to eat. Not only it was tiny but it was so close to the next table that we had to touch the next person making it really uncomfortable. My husband was sitting on the bench with no table in front if him. I wish i took pictures but I was so irritated with the situation and with the fact that the server saw nothing wrong with it that I had yo leave. The entire place is so tiny and crowded ..."
/user_details?userid=yAjs4-c4UyxXYvOwxlJzwQ,Peter Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Extraordinary service, ordinary food. My wife and I were really excited to eat here after hearing about the whole Joe Beef team for years. The design was warm and comfortable, and our server was equally warm and helpful. When we told her we don't eat meat she offered to put together a vegetable/seafood tasting menu for us, which was sweet and exciting. The first dish was really tasty - a healthy portion of white fish caviar paired with some eggplant. Unfortunately the food went downhill from there. The squash falafel bites offered no squash flavor, and just tasted like ordinary falafel - a typically inexpensive dish that's hard to except paying $11 for. I could say the same thing for the next dish - the leeks and mussels - which really just tasted like a side of caramelized onions, with no flavor from the mussels whatsoever (if I'd closed my eyes I wouldn't know mussels were in the dish). The mushrooms with cheese curds also lacked flavor, as the dish just failed to get any of that great mushroom flavor out. On a positive note the wine our server suggested was excellent. Overall we were disappointed, and with so many amazing dining options to choose from in this city, we'll be eating out elsewhere in Montreal going forward."
/user_details?userid=AGc7am5YNLzQIJPHj1nvxg,Jada S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,So loved this meal tonight. Favorites were celery and lobster. So flavorful. The ham with cheese was delicious. The corn foie gras. Pork. Was highly recommended and great. Someone else made a great suggestion of snapping a photo of the menu so you can just read it back at your table. Great idea. Go and enjoy!
/user_details?userid=DHmpzrHejLBLhC0-QNVLrg,Julie P.,"Montreal-West, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place, especially sitting out back on the terrasse. Servers are friendly and laid back. Seating outside is at long communal tables, so count on getting to know your neighbours. Wine list is all private imports I believe, let your server suggest though. Top dishes are the ham with Avonlea cheese and beurre noisette and the cauliflower with chicken skin."
/user_details?userid=8j1WPmKaPN6uEWia99fWSA,D. W.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"Best wine bar in Montreal! The servers are really passionate about wine and food, and take great care of you. We went in, briefly explained what kind of experience we wanted, and they took care of the rest. They have very unique wines and the food was also unique and delicious, everything was paired extremely well. Unfortunately they don't take reservations, but it is well worth the wait!"
/user_details?userid=D3N6XvOxMrvaE2pjvjAYFA,Paul L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Extremely disappointing experience. The single star goes to the locale & our waiter. But the host/maître d's two wine suggestions were terribly amateurish. The vegetarian dishes were bland and uninspiring. The carnivore dishes were certainly the tastier ones and elicit another half star. It feels like this is just another Montreal restaurant earning a reputation based on its brand rather than the product. 1.5 stars.
/user_details?userid=zcSmfz_Y301ev92JRFNFTg,Heather L.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2 star rating,"Very unimpressed by this restaurant. We were looking forward to eating at Joe Beef but it was not opened yet so their waitstaff referred us to their sister restaurant which serves wine and small plates. Our waiter was very nice and friendly and gave us some recomendations. We ordered 3 small plates to start thinking we would order more later. We selected the snow crab, clams casino, and the rotisserie cauliflower. The first 2 were very disappointing. The snow crab came with a dipping sauce that was nothing to write home about. The clams casino didn't seem to have much clam. The one highlight would be the rotisserie cailiflower. That was very tasty and unique and the only reason I give this place 2 stars. Very over priced. Left us wanting more."
/user_details?userid=eJvWbwv5AcNd-x-N_OjqNA,Chris H.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",4 star rating,"VERY GOOD. This is a relatively small ""wine bar"" with indoor and outdoor seating. At the time I visited they didn't have a bar license so we were required to order at least 1 food item (not a bad thing to say the least). This is one of the chalkboard bistros, so take a photo as you pass by the daily listings, otherwise you'll end up standing over random people staring at a list posted on the wall above their table. he food was really good, but be careful of time of day you visit, sometimes only cold items are available. Also, if you're lucky, you may get a tour of the garden that feeds the 3 restaurants (also including Joe Beef & Liverpool House)."
/user_details?userid=S_sIeCOqy7F4RFs0le1cDQ,Joel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,Interesting and creative dishes. The Seven Layer Dip is delicious as are the brussels sprouts. Lots of vegetarian options. Great service and very friendly servers and hosts. Great atmosphere and ambience right down the charming Georges Brassens soundtrack! Very reasonable prices for this type of dining experience. Small restaurant (true bistro) and no reservations but wait time at 7pm on a Friday night was about 10 minutes and it was worth the wait.
/user_details?userid=vyccJ8Ok5zwxBY3G51uJNQ,Ray Ray L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Outstanding.....Stopped in for share plates, on a casual Thursday. We asked the waitress to bring us a couple exciting dishes. The celery root with anchovy vinaigrette was something we would not specifically order but was stunned at the sweetness of the root vegetable and the perfect overtones of fat and acidity from the vinaigrette.Winner was the Guinea Fowl Confit (apparently sourced from a northern Quebec farm) so impressive we ordered a second helping, The fat was completely rendered out, left with a moist wine soaked dark meat. Memories of a 5* Coq Au Vin.Wine list was approachable and reasonably priced. Different, inspiring, engaging and impressive"
/user_details?userid=dQOB54QQNuHkXS8871IZeA,Larry G.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"More of a tapas joint than a full course restaurant.  You need to order min 1.5 dishes per person to not eave hungry. The dishes arrive at 5-10 min intervals so if you're more than 3, you get a couple of mouthfuls of a dish and then end up waiting for the next.  No menus; only chalk board out of sight for most.  Waiters only provided limited info on dishes and that after asking.  Food overpriced but the wine was ridiculously expensive ($17/glass for a mediocre wine with no info from staff).  Overall, this place feels like it is exploiting its association with Joe Beef to overcharge and under-deliver. Won't be going back or recommending."
/user_details?userid=HXCUUfAR_QWKdK2nlYywxQ,Mac M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Another restaurant from the owner of Joe Beef and Liverpool house. The same incredible good food and outstanding selections of wines. The food comes in ""large"" tapas size plates.  The variety of different food plates is also very good so something for everyone.  An expansion is underway with the restaurant taking over a recently vacated space. Hopefully this will mean they will take reservations when they have the larger space. Only bad thing is wine was pricey. Can't wait to return!"

The food is beyond... just simply delectable, with seasonal specialties. The wine... wow... the wine!! A stunning selection of world masters with a great array of by-the-glass choices. I still can't believe how affordable it was. Friendly and super pro service, can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=rRX-Yd5dCa7aR1S2I2zhYA,Warwick A.,"Norman Park, Australia",5 star rating,I have been here a number of times by myself while I have been working in Montreal and it has continued to amaze and delight me. I give that staff full freedom to choose what excites them or the kitchen. On Monday night I took my family there and they could not believe the quality of food and wine. It is a sensational spot. The vegetables dishes are amazing. Let yourself be guided by the staff and not by what you have always eaten.
