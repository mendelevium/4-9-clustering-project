/user_details?userid=ZK8OWdNRO8DgKPw7Otzecg,Alice J.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"The staff here are SO SWEET !! I came here today because I have medical treatments nearby and thought this place was so cozy. They have carefully marked everything for COVID as well and have very reasonable time frames for customers (they ask you stay 2.5 hours or less with a meal, which given how limited seating is due to distancing this is more than reasonable). Will absolutely be coming back!"
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was there yesterday for a meeting and I was very disappointed to see their notice all over the place which essentially says, ""1.5 hour max sitting/drink; 2.5 hour max sitting per meal"". I understand people sometimes go there and work too long while ordering just a coffee or so. But putting such notice almost beside each table is disrespectful to customers and sounds too desperate. I would rather appreciate if the owner focuses on improving their watery latte (is it even a latte)?The place is a nice spot to work but their coffee, latte or any hot beverage is just awful. And the owner and stuff keep coming and check if everyone ordered something. Update: I had to go there again today because I had to meet someone. I had to order something as per their rule and I got a filter coffee. The first thing I felt after my first sip is that how does this place still run business here? And second thought was it was so bad that the badness will kill your drowsiness rather than the caffeine. Also they charge 25cent for tap water now"
/user_details?userid=6j0vsq7BmcGTJX4C9jfzUQ,Pearl L.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"Wide variety of items on the menu--omelettes, waffles, hot & cold sandwiches, coffee, pizzas, wraps, and pastries. A lovely place to get some work done. There are plenty of outlets around and the free WiFi is fast. Their breakfast pizza is a great deal! 3 eggs on a personal-sized pizza with arugula on top. Plenty filling, I came super hungry and had a slice leftover. Cafe policy politely states that folks purchase a drink if they plan to stay less than hours, and those who purchase a meal are welcome to stay for an unlimited time."

I had a smoked meat ciabatta, a bagel with butter, and two coffees. I stayed there and did some work for almost 11 hours. The environment was so comfortable. For anyone who remembers the Second Cup that used to be at this location, this is such an upgrade."
/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Good location to study and tables for groups .. latte 2.50 on Tuesdays.. staff was nice.. that's about all I have to say that's remotely positive  unfortunately.. the almond croissant is worst then one I would get it IGA and the coffee is worst then a Keurig cup .. It's too bad they don't have BYOC (bring your own coffee) then I'd come back to study..
/user_details?userid=OTzAgRLafzhclnCVc2wuZA,Gordon Y.,"Northwest Calgary, Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Came to Montreal one night and didn't want to pay for an extra nights accommodation so decided to spent the night here. This place is lovely inside and out. I came around 1am and stayed until 8am spending time on my computer and dozing off. It was very quiet and two other people had the same idea as me and they slept as well. It was a very quiet and clean place.Theres outlets and wifi making this the optimal study spot.I had the London fog which was very standard. I can't comment too much on the food and coffee, or else i would be tempted to give this place a 5/5.Pros-24 hoursAmazing study spaceFree WifiPeople sleepCleanWould i return? Definetly!"
/user_details?userid=VO964ZoxWcKZ5qUVIN_pZw,Razan A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Clean, open 24hrs and free wifi BUT if you are planning to stay there for long, prepare to pay a fortune with their new policy (1.5 hrs MAX for drinks and 2.5hrs for meals), while prices are actually expensive ($2+ for a small bottle of water and $7+ for a cup of coffee which is far beyond student budget (considering you would need another cup / meal every 1.5 / 2.5 hrs!!). I wouldn't mind paying the exrta dollar for a lovely stay but the staff are slightly rude (first time coming with a friend and they had her through away her starbucks coffee and buy a cup of their coffee which she didnt like and threw away eventually! Their coffee is not the best especially for someone like me owning 2 nespresso machines and lately upgraded to nespresso vertou. A better substitute is second cup on (2020 Boulevard Robert-Bourassa #309) or second cup (1235 Phillips Square) both are located within walking distance, have free wifi and lovely outdoor setting + better coffee and prices + no one would keep looking at you to force you buy another cup of coffee - so unprofessional and disturbing eww...."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was in total shock when I walked by what used to be a 24 hour Second Cup and saw that it was being replaced by Milton B, a 24 hour urban cafeteria.  The Second Cup had been there ever since I first step foot on McGill campus way back when.  It was a very popular study spot with the McGill crowd given its operating hours and proximity to the campus.  Everybody came here when they were a student be it to study or fuel up for a long night of partying.  Anyways, enough nostalgia and on to what I came here to do which is to review the business.Being an urban cafeteria you can expect food like sandwiches and salads.  I have been twice now and on both times the sandwiches could have been a little better.  The first time I came I had a bocconcini pesto sandwich which needed to be toasted longer because the cheese had only half melted.  The second time around I had an apple brie grilled cheese sandwich which was better except they used raisin bread which I found a little odd.I also noticed that the first time I went the salad selection was a little lacklustre but on my return visit it had improved, which makes me think that they were still trying to work out the kinks of being a new business.  The salads are pretty tasty for the most part.  You can get salads that are substantial enough to be a whole meal or smaller ones to accompany a sandwich.They also have a variety of baked goods and sweets if you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth. In general the ones that I have tried have been quite fresh and delicious.  I enjoyed them and they did satisfy my craving for something sweet.When it comes to prices they are what you would expect to pay downtown.  Depending on what you order you can easily get a filling lunch for somewhere between $10 and $15, which is what you can expect to pay in this area of Montreal.  I do feel that you get your money's worth here.  The portions are ample and the quality of the food is pretty good.While this isn't a place offering super cheap eats I can see it doing well with the McGill crowd.  Given the fact that it is a 24 hour place and that they offer coffee and food it would make for a good study spot.  Even if you are not  student it is worth checking Milton B out because they do offer a better alternative to some of the other food court fare that exists downtown."
/user_details?userid=bqNcSooVnxUcatHiihdMow,Naomi D.,"Aylmer, Gatineau, Canada",5 star rating,"An flippin' adorable cafe in a very convenient location. It's a few minutes away from the McGill campus and it's open 24/7.  I ordered a apple strudel and it tasted pretty stale and the crust was rock solid. I'm not gonna lie; I was somewhat disappointed. I don't usually complaint but I managed to get up my arse and tell let the staff that it was somewhat hard, not expecting anything in return. THE STAFF WAS HELLA FRIENDLY and told me I could get something for free which was dope. I proceeded to get a vegan Nutella pastry thingy. Let me tell ya, that shit was good and I would 10/10 recommend. Tip: don't get the apple strudel"
/user_details?userid=kub2IOThcvfymlAHmoX3Ag,Beleenne D.,"Holly Springs, NC",4 star rating,"Milton B has the best chocolate croissant! Try one, and you'll thank me later.We were in town last month and wanted to get smoothies.  This place was closed to our hotel downtown.  It was late afternoon, and it was busy with students.  They have a pretty large seating area outside.  Inside was also packed.  The young lady behind the counter was very friendly.  She greeted us, and recommended her favorite pastry while I was looking at the case.My husband had a strawberry banana smoothie, and he liked it.  The pastry case looked so good! So, I decided to get, not one, but two chocolate croissants.  I seriously wished that I've gotten two more.  They were warm, crispy, and so good. The place was definitely too crowded for me to sit back and relax, but looked like a great hangout spot.  I will visit again next time I'm in Montréal."

/user_details?userid=RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,Madhu K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Milton B replaces the iconic second cup cafe at the du parc street. I have spend many a study/recreational hours at the previos second cup. So when Milton B opened finally after the long wait, I was one of the few first ones to check it out. The ambience of the plcae is refreshing, bright and beautifully furnished with light wood chic furniture. I would definitely be a regular here as well. They offer the normal tea/cafe options with a variety of eating options as well."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"After spending many nights here this past school year, here are my thoughts. I appreciate that it is 24 hours. The vegetarian grilled cheese is especially delicious and I usually don't like pesto. The vegetarian pizza is also good and I usually don't like olives. I am not a fan of the drinks, especially the coffee/espresso ones. Matcha latte is also a no for me. The teas are a good deal if you're saying for a long time-- $5 and you can get refills. I recommend the dragon pearl jasmine tea but tbh all jasmine teas are great. It can get quite packed at times but all in all a very convenient cafe."
/user_details?userid=p-iIAeX6So38SntVavWXjw,Saewon P.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Milton B has has many selections for a cafe and most things are decent. It's also clean and convenient for those going to school nearby
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is probably my favourite studying place in the McGill Ghetto and definitely my favourite on Parc. I didn't frequent the Second Cup very much, but I'd been there enough times to notice, in my opinion, the definite improvements. For one, I love the new lighting! The lighting had been one of the main reasons I disliked studying at the Second Cup in the past. The other reason had been the rather awkwardly placed tables. Milton B improved this greatly with their large tables; in fact, my favourite place to sit is the big table in the middle.As for what they serve, I have yet to try any food there since I tend to come after supper (I'm super glad they kept the open 24 hours feature). The drinks are nice, not too overpriced, and the teas come on the cutest bamboo board. Once the semester starts, I think I'll become more of a regular. But for now, there's more of the city to be seen!"
/user_details?userid=mGpSdlT6XfHOtr-uHJgRzA,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best coffee shop EVER! Trust me - Take it from me as a regular happy client :) MILTON B, the newly urban cafeteria has been my place and the place of many people to have a delicious ""third wave"" coffee, 100% natural smoothie, freshly prepared baked foods while being super productive, read, relax, meet interesting people that last a lifetime in a friendly ecological, sustainable and communal environment. There is 2 private meeting areas if you need privacy as well. (You can rent the space for free only if you buy coffee and some food) BEST PART? It's Open 24 Hrs A Day & You get your money's worth! ;"
/user_details?userid=OyWhTonjjiaIzjSeNPeGcA,Koji S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As basically the only 24 hour café in the area with outlets, I need it more than I love it, quite frankly. Service has always been quite nice, decor is clean, there's a good variety of seats (high, low, comfy), enough outlets, and WiFi is almost always good - it's just the prices that keep me from gushing."
/user_details?userid=MzXqqvjP-d8tuj765TI1og,Thomas J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally a place where Wi-Fi works in this city, and finally a local coffee shop owner that apparently understands the importance of reliable Wi-Fi. Terrace has always been awesome, and still is. Great 24h location."
/user_details?userid=ZEaXcUg3TgKrfW-dgKG-uA,Fariha A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a great study spot. I'm definitely here a lot during finals. I only keep coming back for the great study atmosphere and the free wifi definitely not for the food. They could really improve on the drinks and the food quality. I would study here with a tim hortons coffee if I could. However, I have to give a well deserved shoutout to the pizzas they serve, it's soo cheesy and delicious. Probably the best food they have but since its like 10$, I can't order it everyday and go broke, so unfortunately I often settle for cheaper options that don't satisfy my tastebuds as much:("
/user_details?userid=ZOcpc64cpcJzm9kJyHjB-A,John R.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Awesome place to study, chill, or just hangout with friends. Always trying to improve their menu. Prices are fair and the terrace is perfect!"
/user_details?userid=mwmJ25NHo_3_9s2g-oXHZg,Starshine J.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This is a great place to study for free, they often do not come up and force you to buy anything, which is clutch for students. If you do feel like being a good person and buying something DO NOT get a smoothie. They taste like vomit, not 100% natural. I should be getting a free pastry for drinking half of that."
