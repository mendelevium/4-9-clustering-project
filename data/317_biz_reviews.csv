I haven't explored very many restaurants in Saint-Henri yet, but after this experience I think I will be checking other places out as well. I made online reservations, where I specified one person is vegetarian. I was quite pleased when the manager, Jessica, called back to follow up on this request and go over my options. The menu has many more non-veg options, however, they do have a Boston salad, mushroom pappardelle and a cauliflower dish which are great veg options. Everything was so well presented and explained and tasted incredible. I'm not a fan of cauliflower,but this dish made me question it. It's perfect roasted, presented on a creamy feta sauce, with sprinkles of plump raisins and toasted pine nuts. Altogether a perfect bite with great textures and tastes. I couldn't take pictures of the food unfortunately... since it was a business dinner... but will go back and make sure I do;)"

It's a nice and spacious restaurant which serves brunch and supper. We got a nice spot to sit by the wall on the couch. One wall is decorated by a large water paint, another wall has beautiful photographs of different world's objects.The service was very amiable, cordial and helpful. Our waitress answered all our questions with good knowledge. My sister had pain perdu (French toast, chocolate sauce, vanilla whip cream and mix berry fruits) with fresh squeezed orange juice. I had piri piri chicken with arugula salad and breakfast seasoned potatoes with a cup of cappuccino. Both of us enjoyed our dishes tremendously. In the end, the courtesy of the restaurant we had a mini fruit salad. It was delicious! Lovely place; great service and excellent food!"

It takes me so long to eat at 3734 because I spend the time savouring the flavour combinations. Your tartar was amazing, every mouthful is a journey, the charcuterie, butternut, I could go on and on. Bravo.Don't change your service, it's understated, attentive, calming and personal. Good prices for this level of dish, nice portion sizes, tasty beer selection, really like the reasto interior. I really can't fault you. You guys have a winning combination. Don't change a thing."

All of it was topped off with a Pear and Vanilla desert. Excellent and I will be back."
/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We came here on a Tuesday night and to our surprise, it was empty 1 The whole night we were the only table there which, I'm not complaining about since we had the restaurant, the waitress and the chef to ourselves. The service was definitely perfect considering that factor, and so was the food. It is on the pricey side for the small tapas you get, but the flavor is definitely there. The piri piri chicken is unique, didn't taste any like this one in Montreal. t's good that they change their menu often because being 4, we ordered almost all the 10 tapas that were listed."
/user_details?userid=-Ut-P8fJLACB1voaP19vyQ,Katie Y.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A beautiful trendy but calm restaurant with a terrasse! The food was exceptional. Produce was fresh. Great portions with an explosion of flavours. I felt like the menu was rather simple, but every plate came as a surprise as there was so much more flavours and items in the plate than described. Personnel was also very nice. We took 4 dishes (bison, tomatoes, tagliatelle and octopus) with a desert. Everything was perfect!Our personal favorites were the pasta (as the dish came in, the newcomers peaked at our table to see what we had just ordered!!) and the light tomato dish.Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Super cute brunch place. Really spacious. I tried their salmon and latke brunch. It was delicious. The salmon is almost raw but it goes beautifully with the perfectly fried potato latke, poached eggs and mustard sauce. The eggs are soft and so perfect! The dishes look as good as they taste. Definitely returning to try their benedicts."
/user_details?userid=RFlOKQCVYe50l0qLY14JJA,Lorenzo N. M.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Me and my friend were basically the first ones there (we arrived 5 minutes before they opened). It was a snowy weekend so we were told they weren't expecting many people to come since it was snowing (apparently people in Montreal don't go out when it snows). I have to say, the service was excellent. The waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful. She accommodated my dietary restrictions and made sure there was no pork in my brunch. She came back to check on us various times like you would normally expect back in the States. The food itself was really good. The meat was delicious and the portion was just big enough to fill you without feeling nauseated. I would definitely recommend this place. The menu was big enough to satisfy different tastes and the price was excellent. Only reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the intense smell of smoke/meat that stayed on my clothes and hair the whole day after coming here. They should maybe invest in a better filter system or whatever it is that restaurants to not have the patrons smell like a barbecue."
/user_details?userid=LJAbzKY3JbMUm9SC3RvXqw,J P.,"Saint Louis, MO",5 star rating,"This restaurant is so so good! Tapas which are larger portions than appetizers but smaller than entrees were perfect sharing sizes.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  The most impressive thing other than the wonderful ambience was our amazing waitress MJ! She was the only waitress/hostess in the place (and for all I know could have been cooking all the food in the back also), and we never wanted for anything.  She was so nice and pleasant even though she was obviously working her tail end off.  It might have been our favorite meal in Montreal and it was the only one we just popped in and didn't have a reservation for. Would definitely recommend."

The waitress told me that the restaurant specializes in Portuguese food, but I didn't really like it because it is really too different from the Portuguese food I tried in Portugal. Their portion is decent but overall their dishes are not wow."
/user_details?userid=23naRmK_DDRh4FNLZmn5LQ,Tiam D.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Very tasty lunch! The place is very cute and the menu is highlighting a variety of original ingredients in an original way. They have a little shop right next to the restaurant that sells rustic products. Love!

/user_details?userid=AiHCk_OSpnebz6nFYMC_Pg,Yasmeena S.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,My first review ever but I felt I owed it to the chef for the amazing food we had last night! 5 star service and 5 star food! A must!
/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Funky cool ambiance. Outdoor terrace available. The Piri Piri chicken was perfection! Loved it. The entrees were delicious too but if you have them as your meal take three as they are small. Well worth the visit.
/user_details?userid=Yaq28mlEEiopt9TVmcauwA,Fadi S.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yesterday was the second time we tried this restaurant. We had tried brunch a while back and it was really good that we wanted to also try their dinner menu. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu as we were quite a few of people and wanted to share. The food was beyond amazing !! The dessert was also great!Great service as well, the staff was really friendly. This place is a must try !! Two thumbs up and highly recommend if you like a tapas type place."
/user_details?userid=PeB5RAi2rsdJUunKvo8pLQ,Brandon W.,"Auburn, NY",5 star rating,"Wonderful lunch! Our experience in Montreal is that the food here is better than Paris. 3734 is a nice neighborhood restaurant. The grilled cheese and hamburger were fantastic! Everything is reasonable in price. The service is personable and friendly, just as you would expect from a neighborhood place. This is very close to the Atwater Marche, good place to linger for a simple lunch."
/user_details?userid=NAs9A-CgIIs1nYd-6Ab-ow,Michel P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Awesome brunch, great portions, really good prices. We tried the grilled cheese, the casserole, and espressos, everything was really tasty. We're lucky to have many good brunch spots in St-Henri, and 3734 might be the best of them."
/user_details?userid=z2cL_vSc8hCNr7lZ4wCWyA,Jonathan N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I stopped here when our other 2 restaurants nearby were full. They were very accommodating and found us a table even without a reservation on a very busy evening. The food was a bit sparse for the cost, but the food was absolutely exquisite! The harmonious flavours complimented well the visual aspects of the plate. The carrot purée was my favourite part of the lamb dish. And The Maple dessert was heavenly. Fine dining at a fine restaurant."
/user_details?userid=1vVIdlctDnS45ISfIlteFw,Shannen F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was a little disappointed by the food. Not exceptionnal. I ordered the burger and it was not bad but not very tasty. The fries were good but the red coleslaw was weird... The service was good, the waitress nice, however I found the owner cold... What a pity"
