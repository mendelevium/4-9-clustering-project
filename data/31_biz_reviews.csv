I love the feel of reubens it reminds me of a classic NYC resto feel with the service and feel Service: 5 stars all the way Fancy and well treated always !the staff is super attentive and friendly they truly care and always give me the best service !

/user_details?userid=WT6yryyLUiDLLcvNfwOH3A,Raymond Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Came on a weekend shortly before 6pm, the place was popping and we luckily managed to get a table before the wait began to build.Ordered the signature original Reuben sandwich. Delicious piles of sliced smoked meat with melted Swiss cheese in a savory grilled sandwich. I can see why they are known for this sandwich as it was just incredibly filling and tasty.Also, got the original strawberry cheesecake and the wild blue yonder cheesecake to share with my group. The original strawberry cheesecake was alright, the cheesecake section was kinda bland. The wild blue yonder cheesecake was a lot better and a lot more richer. Though, I am biased being from NY and always eating NY style cheesecakes. They were giant portions so I would recommend ordering one to share. Everything here is actually giant portions so I would recommend ordering single dishes and splitting it."

With our entourage we decided to try this place that's been a staple of the neighborhood for some time. Parking can be tough as it's usually a challenge in the city. However once inside the place is quite spacious with glass displays of all their delicatessen and meats that they're known for. As for main I ordered their famous Rueben sandwich and boy was it huge, more meat than what the sandwich could hold. Served with pickles and fries this dish was easily a shareable for two. Prices are on the mid-higher end die to the area and popularity, however still worth the experience for those who have never been here."

It reminds me of an old school NY deli, they have local celebrities and professional sports players who have signed plates hanging on the wall.We each had a sandwich, I had a turkey melt- it was good. With poutine fries on the side. My partner in crime had a French dip sandwich it was good.  We split the fried pickles to start.... AMAZING. They had big desserts but we were to full and wanted to continue to get our shop on. Service was okay, we were without water and the waiter forgot my Perrier but it was fairly busy. I'd come back for the pickles."

I ordered the smoked meat salad and it was amazing! Large enough to share with a couple people but absolutely delicious! The presentation was amazing!

The place is now pretty much a stalwart for the traditional Montreal smoked meat aka Pastrami brisket. On a recent Sunday night the place was pretty crowded and we ordered the 10 oz smoked meat sandwiches on rye.  Naturally you can get largerones, dare I say supersize, but this simply too much food.  Fries, a pickle and you are happy.  Our server was prompt and pleasant and suggested some Canadian Lager on tap.  Good idea.Such meals are filling and there's never room for desert but most patronsseem to order one anyway.Reuben's is consistent and decently priced and always a good pitstop from downtown shopping.  We'll be back!"

IMO it is the best smoked meat sandwich and I'd like to think I've had many in my time (including a few in Montreal). Reubens is located right in downtown Montreal and is on their busiest street St. Catherine's. Big but good menu, service is good and portion is huge... so come with an appetite, portion is good enough to share. If you feeling really meaty... get the smoked meat chopped up on your poutine... so good!!"

They were busy but we were seated quickly. The display case has you drooling for dessert before you even sit down. We started with some delicious cocktails and an order of the chop chop poutine. We are from the US so that poutine is a treat for us. Then we each had a sandwich! Woof that's a lot of food (and fries unless you sub for a salad). I couldn't stop thinking about those deserts in the case. Even though we were stuffed we went for the cheesecake. I don't want to say I was disappointed but my expectations were high since I'd been thinking about it since we walked in. I would have liked more sauce / berries. It was a very cheesy cheesecake, not a lot of crust or sweetness. Maybe I'm not familiar with that style, but I prefer a sweeter creamier cheesecake."
/user_details?userid=8BARDuw9utiKUj6Cfvfa0Q,Angel S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My first Montreal smoked meat sandwich in dt Montreal! This place is very convenient if you are far away from Schwartz and don't want wait in the line. Must Try Lunch Item: Reubens original sandwich. It came in large portion, piled with smoked meats and cheese melted on of top, buttered rye breads. This was all topped off with skinny fries, a pickle and coleslaw. The the size of the sandwich came served in halves. It was def shareable with a friend or you could opt to take the second half to go to avoid afternoon food-itis. Due to the large portion, I went totally all out on fingering the sandwich rather than trying to be fancy with the fork/knife. The meat was mmmm yummy and the bread was so moist, deliciously complimented by the salted cheese. The waiters were also super attentive on filling our waters and checking up on us. The atmosphere was def good for business client lunch although it could get a bit loud given all the tourists visiting in the area."

Extremely busy restaurant but the service is pretty good. Tried the big bang (1lb smoked meat) and it was thick, and the meat was moist. Only minor issue is there is no way the bread can hold the a sandwich with this much meat. The portion of fries with the meal is almost a meal in itself as well. Overall a great experience and would return."

I must say, my friends and I are not big meat-eaters so the poutine and the sandwich together was a little much. I think I had enough meat to last me the week. But i was happy to have tried both famous dishes and enjoyed both very much. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice but it is definitely a popular place and pretty crowded with both locals and tourists. They had some pretty delicious looking desserts and cheesecake that my friends and I had no more space in our stomachs for but will try next time! The service was also great, had a lovely waiter, very welcoming and happy to explain the food to newbies :)"
/user_details?userid=gmAK88-BHTm1bxYlecrXcw,Zeina A.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,"Before we visited Montreal for the first time we asked for suggestions, most people told us to check out Reuben's. When we walked in the place was packed but we were seated fairly quickly, I asked our waiter Murad H. if I could substitute a vegetarian option for some of the dishes (ex. Greek chicken salad without chicken). He was very rude and told us he could put a note on our order but would charge us the same amount for all dishes. When we asked him for some vegetarian options on the menu he was not helpful at all and gave us attitude. A different waiter came and gave us our food I ordered a plain spaghetti with tomato sauce and the person I was with ordered a deli sandwich option. The food was not bad but we were extremely disappointed with the service. Not once did our waiter check on us or stop by our table. I suggest for anyone visiting Montreal to go to a different restaurant for an authentic experience. We left and grabbed drinks at another restaurant down the street which had much better service Update: it's hilarious looking at all the negative reviews for this establishment. They all follow the same line of ""are you sure it's this location not one further down the street"" I doubt they take these complaints seriously and use it to teach their staff about customer service. Lots of other restaurants in town that you should visit before Rueben's"

One of my favorite places in New York is Katz's deli For the pastrami sandwich. Accidentally found Rubens while walking downtown and I have to say this might be my favorite restaurant ever! The interior is beautiful the smells a wonderful and so are the staff. First smell was breakfast, eggs and a couple pieces of smoked meat. It was very good but in no way prepared me for when we came back for lunch and had the Reuben sandwich! Oh my God! I cannot say enough about the sandwich. Today I had the 10 ounce smoked meat famous sandwich and I am in love with it. I'm not a huge guy but next time we go there which might have to be in the next couple days I am going to have the 1 pound smoked meat sandwich! You live once but you can eat often at Rubens.

We sat down he came over with water and just left. Once he came over to our table to take our order, he didn't even explain that we can choose a different a side with our sandwiches. He just stood there and placed our order. We ordered the short rib poutine, roast beef melt, and a spaghetti. We realized we can replace the fries with something else when we overheard the other servers saying you can replace fries with other sides. The other servers were very accommodating, friendly, and actually acknowledge their customers while our waiter could not have been more indifferent.Also, the food took a decent amount of time to come. I noticed other tables that were there after us were getting their food first. So overall was not a good experience."

Needless to say, I wanted this to be the best meal, sadly was the worst meal of my trip.This place is a perfect tourist trap and I went here based on some of the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the Rib Tips as my entree and we also ordered the Chop Chop Poutine - both of which were really bad, the poutine being the worst. Their dishes are very high on sodium, especially the poutine which left a terrible, salty after taste in our mouth.One star goes to our wonderful waitress who did a great job. She was extremely warm and welcoming. Food deserves a big fat zero! Will not recommend this place to anyone for food."
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I felt like having a smoke meat sandwich during my lunch. There are a few places that serve smoke meat within the downtown core. I was hearing some positive things about the Reuben's Deli & Steakhouse near Peel on Ste-Catherine so I decided to give it a try. I've been to the Reuben's located near McGill College Avenue a few times so I wanted to give this Reuben's a try.I went in and the hostess asked me how many people and I said one. She then asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table and I mentioned that it didn't really bother me. She walked me over to a table and placed a few menus on the table along with my utensils. Inside, this place appeared nicer than the Reuben's located downstairs near McGill College Avenue.I took a look at one of the menus and noticed that they offered a lunch smoke meat special so I opted to go with that. There was an option to have beer so I picked this option.The server came by my table and asked me whether I wanted to start off with something to drink. I mentioned that I had decided that I would have the lunch smoke meat combo with a beer.She picked up my menus and a few minutes later, she came back with my beer. Not wanting to finish my beer before my lunch arrived, I waited for my smoke meat combo (smoke meat sandwich on rye bread, pickle, coleslaw, and fries) which came a few minutes later.The fries were shoestring type fries and I found them to be a bit on the hard side so it was difficult at times to use my fork to get the fries. The coleslaw was very good and the pickle was good (i.e. neither were too sour or too salty for my taste). The smoke meat sandwich was humongous. In terms of the taste of it, it was good but I found it to be a bit too ""wet"" and prefer the much drier/flakier smoke meat variety of Smoke Meat Pete and/or Schwartz's.Finished my meal and my beer and was asked if I wanted something else. I looked at my watch and except for asking for a glass of water, I declined since I needed to leave. She asked me if I was going to pay by card or cash. I mentioned I would pay by credit card and she returned with a portable card machine. I paid my bill, finished my water and left.When paying my bill, the server was standing somewhat close and over me which made me somewhat uncomfortable. I'm not sure if she felt that I would steal the portable card machine, damage it, or not leave a tip.In terms of the seating, I should have probably opted to sit at the bar since I was seated right next to where the servers get their utensils (and I believe water) so it was somewhat busy/noisy where I was sitting as multiple servers kept coming back/forth behind me to collect their items. So servers were standing slightly on my back left corner somewhat regularly during my lunch.I rank the experience and food 3.5 stars which I've generously rounded up to 4"

Located at the heart of downtown, and always busy, they have great service, delicious smoked meat and plenty of other menu options if that's not your kind of food.I actually prefer this smoked meat to any other place I've tried in Montreal. They slice it real thin and it's very tasty and juicy.During my last visit, I ordered the Super Reuben sandwich (I think it's called), served with fries, coleslaw and a pickle. The waitress was excellent and even brought me a sample when I wasn't sure if I'd like it. The portions are huge so either come starving or prepare to take a doggy bag home! I've always enjoyed my food here and I'm already craving their sandwich again!! Will be returning."

The sandwich itself was good, but definitely doesn't compare to Schwartz's. The meat here is closer to pastrami while Schwart's is closer to corned beef. The cole slaw that comes with the sandwich is delicious. We ordered plain poutine instead of fries and it was okay, a bit flavorless.For drinks, we the STRAWBERRY CAIPIROSKA. It was delicious and the bartender was really great and friendly. It just doesn't seem like they wash the measuring cups too frequently."

It was very tasty, there's no denying that. Love that I can get cherry peppers on the side here too. This place feels like a quintessential New York City deli with giant sandwiches and oversized slices of cake! What's not to like?!We told our server how much we enjoyed our meals, and he responded with... telling us how we should really try somewhere else!! He said the meat here isn't smoked in house and that he isn't even sure how it is made, and then told us the places to go if we wanted real smoked meat. Now, I'm not sure what to think about this place. It's obviously carved in house because we could see them slicing it.. I guess that's what they mean by ""prepared in house."" Kind of disappointing to hear, especially after I was about to walk away so happy!"

The chef was kind enough to drop it to me himself as I was seated at the bar next to the kitchen. Sam's service is informative and engaged, despite his back and forth making the drinks and desserts for the rest of the waitstaff. The wait times have always been reasonable, and while it is a little more expensive than my usual fares, the quality and location make it a reasonable price. All my interactions with their staff from hostess to chef have been positive and memorable, which is rare in this industry where table turnover is often prioritized over treatment of the individual."

We got there pretty late but the place was still in full swing. We ordered the chicken club, original reuben sandwich and a salad that is no longer on the menu but served with shrimp. Their chicken club was HUGE. Large pieces of chicken breast on a nicely toasted white bun and triple layered with a nice smattering of tomatoes. We really enjoyed this dish and accepted that the high price was because of the huge portion. The original reubens sandwich was actually better than Schwartz in our opinion! The meat was not as salty and the sauerkraut had just the right amount of acid to balance the flavours. The most disappointing was the salad since although it was piled high, was VERY expensive for the few pieces of shrimp.Overall, we came here because it was close to our hotel but were surprised by the food."

/user_details?userid=KkXjeo5DfzcUlFfmyoRbCg,Jeremy P.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Instagram might tell you that Schwartz' is the place to be, but anyone saying that hasn't had a full fat Montreal smoked meat sandwich from Reubens.Reubens is a much more chill, relaxing environment than many of the other smoked meat places. The large layout and upstairs floor means that you and your friends can get a table at almost any time of the day. The resturaunt is a classic Montreal-style restaurant, dimly lit, and unpretentious. The wait staff is always hilarious and attentive, which is all you can ask for.Now for the food. I'm usually more of a fan of Pastrami sandwiches over smoked meat (nothing tops Katz's in New York), but this smoked meat is the best I've ever had. When ordering from Reubens, you can choose the level of fat that you want on the sandwich. Being that this occasion was a Bachelor Party, we got the maximum amount of fat possible. It was borderline absurd, but we'll worth it.In under 20 minutes, we were greeted with plates of packed smoked meat sandwiches, pickles, and poutines. The pefect Montreal combo. Pair that with any of their select French-Canadian beers, and it's nothing short of perfection. The sandwiches were dripping fat, the poutine cheeses curds were loud and squeaky (as they should be!), and the pickles were delicious. Pro tip: mustard is the only condiment that should ever be used on a smoked meat or Pastrami sandwich. Don't be the person to smother it in ketchup and ruin it.After the sandwiches, we somehow had room for dessert. After looking through a selection of cakes, we settled on a mix of chocolate cakes, croissants, and coffees. Everything was great. So great that we went the next two nights in a row!5/5"
/user_details?userid=7jdjcNBbcpNKFlHRduZIxA,Sophia L.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"UPDATE (01/2019): **Read the business manager's reply.** I docked another star because I do not appreciate being second guessed about where I ate. I am 100% sure this is where I ate. The decor is exactly where I was. I can even point out exactly where I sat (when you walk in, on the back left corner there are a set of stairs that lead to the bathroom - I had sat directly in front of the stairs in a booth). In terms of breakfast sandwiches, I looked. My bf and I had even asked our waiter specifically if they had breakfast options and our waiter explicitly said that they do not have a breakfast menu or breakfast sandwich options. So either your waiter was inexperienced (which, didn't sound like he was) or he was too lazy to give us the breakfast menu/point it out to us. I do not appreciate being second guessed. I stand by the rest of my review though._____They have a wide array of sandwiches...but no breakfast sandwiches? But they are open during breakfast hours? I feel like that's a missed business opportunity...But at the same time, their sandwiches are so expensive. I've never seen such expensive sandwiches that actually only tasted okay.... and I think the reason why they are so pricey is that they load up a large plate of fries... but I'd rather have it be cheaper coz whoever finishes all their fries? lol I don't know if I'll ever go back... just wasn't that good tbh. Unless you like a large plate of food and a sandwich so big you gotta move the meat around to fit it in your mouth lol"

Order anything with smoked meat in it and you know it will be amazing.We were here for lunch on boxing day and the place was packed. Even so, we were seated right away. The moment we sat down, we placed an order of the smoked meat poutine and it did not disappoint. The meat was so flavorful and well seasoned. After that, we continued our meal with more smoked meat by getting the famous super sandwiches and sliders. The best part was we were able to turn our side of fries into side of poutine. You can never go wrong with more poutine. The brisket was so tender and marbled with good amount of fat. It had a good pepper flavor without being overwhelming. I could just  eat pounds and pounds of the meat by itself. We also tried the bbq short rib poutine but it was just okay. I was not the biggest fan of the bbq sauce. Wanting to venture out of the smoked meat dishes, I got the prime rib beef sandwich as well. It was a little lackluster. It was bland and dry. Overall, it was a great meal.

We liked the booth seating and the bottles of wine all around on the walls. We had the famous smoked meat sandwich and a smoked meat salad (not sure if that's the right name...). We ordered a bottle of wine which we didn't finish and our server recorked it and packed it up with our food so we had a nice picnic later in our air bnb. The portions were big enough to feed us twice. It was busy and happening. I would love to go back again."
/user_details?userid=5JguATKx7KsLDqbpnFnvFg,Dr. Scott C.,"Charleston, SC",5 star rating,We actually got this recommendation from our Club Level Host at our hotel to go to Reuben's for lunch today!  We got here right around 12:15 and the hostess greeted us immediately and seated us right away. The interior of this restaurant is awesome with fantastic wood work. Our waitress Kelsey very courteous and took great care of us. Plus she is bilingual which made it very easy to order. Of course I asked which was the better sandwich and Kelsey said the Reuben hands down!  So 3 of us ordered the Reuben sandwich and 1 ordered the French Dip sandwich. I felt the Reuben was the better choice and it is definitely the best Reuben I have ever tasted!  The Reuben was piled high with Corned Beef and it came with Cole Slaw and Fries. This was an incredible lunch and I highly recommend coming to Reuben's when you are in Montréal!  Thanks to Kelsey for steering us in the right direction!  Reuben's is a very strong 5 Stars !!

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm a fan of any place that will feed my most gluttonous urges within about 8 minutes of sitting down.The food here is staunchly middle of the road, but as far as that goes, they execute average food flawlessly and consistently, if that makes any sense. You see, Montreal has several breeds of smoked meat. Schwartz's, The Main, and Smoked Meat Pete offer customers the dry, deep red authentic smoked meat that I crave and prefer above all. This is the real deal and it's hard to find. The fact that it cannot be procured in downtown Montreal is a sad statement. After these establishments, everyone else including Reuben's, Dunn's, and Lester's serves a second version I refer to as ""wet"" smoked meat. (Dunn's used to serve the real deal smoked meat described above but they switched to the generic version about 10 years ago. Yes, I noticed.)  The product may still be hand carved, but this ubiquitous version of meat is characterized by deep steaming, consistently thin pink slices, and a generic salty and peppery taste. There is nothing wrong with this. It will scratch your itch but it's still not the old school smoked meat with subtle flavours that make you feel like you are taking a bite out of St. Lawrence boulevard circa 1955. Snowdon Deli is a satisfying hybrid of the two genres, but that's another review for another day.Anyhow, this Reuben's deli located on St. Catherine has been renovated several times over the years and charges 20-25$ for a smoked meat and fries. Fine, take my money and give me my ""drugs"". That is kind of the attitude I take when I'm really hungry. Don't get distracted by their huge menu. Get a smoked meat sandwich or a Reuben. Honourable mention goes to their club roll piled high with stuffed chicken, salami, and smoked meat all served grilled on a roll. Order it with a slice of swiss cheese. Fries are slightly above average. Just to blend in with the tourists, I ordered a smoked meat poutine for 13 dollars. What a sad dish. A poutine should be the size of my head with no exceptions. This one was served in a small bowl with microscopic chopped smoked meat. It was alright, but could have used a coarser chop on the smoked meat and a larger portion to share. They ought to walk around the corner to La Belle Province on Peel. They'll show you how to build a poutine that will take a guy down for the count. Come to think of it, most spots in this city serve their poutines in meal sized portions; Especially when charging 13$ for them.My wife got the chicken caesar salad with dressing on the side. Bless her heart. Anyhow, if you are trying to catch a movie or an event at the Bell Centre, this place is fast and predictable. You can depend on Reuben's."

I especially loved the seasoned chips; the fries were good too.My only reason for not giving 5* is because the rolls & the rye bread were not amazing and that was a little disappointing.

I could have ordered three orders of this just for my meal. Also enjoyed the vegetable flatbread. The veggies were so fresh, you could tell it was made to order. I would highly recommend this place.

The meat was good on both, but I'm not a fan of the way the sandwich is put together--meat and toppings are piled high in the very center of the bread and then the sandwich is sliced. This makes for a sandwich with shifted toppings on half the bread. Why??? Just to make it look piled high. The toppings also seemed sloppily prepared. I've had a better Reuben elsewhere. Service was decent, though the food took a while to come out."

I fully expect a lightning bolt to strike me down for saying this but it's true. The smoked meat poutine needs to seriously work on its fries. They were like flaccid Macdonald's fries. It's not that hard to do. Otherwise I would give this place five stars. Another tip, if you order the Famous Super sandwich you can upgrade the fries to poutine. This was enough for two of us to get a fix and not have to walk around hating ourselves all day."

They have a wide variety of cheesecakes (and other desserts too, but mostly cheesecakes) - choose the Montreal-style strawberry cheesecake. It's so tall, the strawberries on top are fresh and plump, and it's very smooth and creamy! Portions are huge and price is reasonable. Service is friendly, but a little too prompt (waitress tried clearing our plates before we were done TWICE). Nice atmosphere on a busy boulevard next to H&M. I will definitely be back!"

There are two locations on St. Cats, but we've only been to this one which is somewhere between fancy steakhouse and casual diner. The other one seems more like a take out joint but I'm just guessing. The staff here is fantastic and very helpful, going above and beyond their duties.  The first time we were here we had a double stroller and I felt bad about taking up so much space but the staff was so nice and found a perfect spot for it without batting an eye. Made us feel very welcomed and was really sweet with the kids. Another time, one of our waiters was kind enough to recommend where locals buy household goods and appliances while we were staying in town.  Really appreciate people who love their job. It really shines through. Ok let's talk about food!  The pastrami sandwich is a must. They have a special with their house beer which is fantastic. I can't remember whether it's just a lunch special or all day but the sandwich/beer combo is stellar. I believe the beer was crafted specifically for them so definitely ask about that beer."

Flavor wise it's more salty so it's better you eat it with something than just plain meat. Different experience but definitely still good. Sandwich also comes with fries and slaw. I prefer the slaw here as it's not too watery compared to Schwartz. Wait was a tad long for the food to arrive considering it's just a sandwich."

I was so excited to get my hands on it and dig it!  The smoked meat was actually quite good.  It was tender and moist.  The rye bread was a bit soft with the mustard on it.  I ate it quickly to avoid the moist rye bread from falling apart.  I liked how big of a portion the meat was! I'm glad we shared this between the two of us since I definitely wouldn't have been able to finish one whole sandwich by myself.  (Glad that the sandwich was already split in half.)The portion of fries was soooo impressively large.  They were skinny fries.  The coleslaw was so good and was like comfort food to me after eating the smoked meat sandwich.The Baby House Salad was fresh and a good portion of greens for us in conjunction with the smoked meat sandwich.My relatives seemed to enjoy the smoked meat sandwiches they ordered too.  It was their first time eating Montreal smoked meat.  My aunt who ordered the pasta though thought the pasta was too al dente for her taste.When it came to paying the bill, I'm not sure why the server had to again emphasize the fact that '""one person"" had mentioned individual billing at first and it turned out not to be'... it wasn't necessary to voice that again. ... a-hole server.All in all, I'm very glad we were able to try this restaurant.  I can finally compare it to Schwartz's smoked meat!  However, although the food was good, the service here from the male server that night was downright rude and spoke unnecessary backhanded unprofessional comments directed at me. :/  It definitely made for a mixed first impression of Reuben's Deli."

You can choose the amount of fat you want on the meat in your sandwich and I chose medium. Being my first night in Montreal, the poutine hit the spot and was really good. The size of the sandwich shocked me at first, but I was ready to tackle it. The meat was so soft and not tough at all. It was smoked really well. It was nice that they gave me a bottle of mustard on the side because it definitely needed a bit more mustard. The bread also wasn't anything too impressive to me; just al-rye-t (lol).It was a Sunday night and I was able to get a table spot (I was by myself) even though they initially just offered me a spot at the bar. The servers were really nice, helpful, and attentive to me.

We got the Famous Super Sandwich and the Original Reuben Sandwich. Both were excellent. The Famous comes with a little mustard on it so you can really taste the smoked flavor of the beef. I only wish the rye bread was better. Crust was very soft and not much rye flavor. Maybe something closer to a Jewish rye would be better. The Reuben was on nicely grilled pumpernickel. For sides, we substituted poutine and cole slaw. The cole slaw is a finely chopped vinegar style and goes well with the meat. Poutine has nice curds, but the fries held up only ok with the gravy. I would have given this 5 stars if they had more beer on tap. Pretty much just 6 basic / mellow beers. Sadly, they had run out of the Hops & Bolt I.P.L.

I held the door open for an older gentleman, who appreciated the gesture. He was a regular, as he was promptly seated. I was seated quickly, too. I just visit every year or less. I ordered the beef dip on a French baguette. So flavourful and delicious. Good bread + au jus + tender beef = perfection!Naturally, I ordered a Diet Coke to wash everything down. For someone who doesn't love fries, these were good. A woman at the booth next to mine complained that she didn't want a mountain of fries. I agree with her, but she downright said it in a harsh, loud manner. She then stomped out of the eatery. Of course, I was stuffed, but still managed to order the bread pudding with ice cream. It was decadent and yummy. One of the servers actually turned her head at what she saw before me and asked whether I liked it. She has yet to try it.

I really did not appreciate being the butt of his jokes 3 times during the evening. These were very insulting jokes and I was in shock to hear something like that . I was very disappointed this visit  and won't go back.

There was nothing wrong as far as a problem with the sandwich to warrant sending it back or notifying the server as suggested by the manager in the response, i just didn't think it tasted good."

We got the mac & cheese, original sandwich and a burger. The noodles in the mac & cheese were almost as if they were from a box and they just put smoked meat on it. I was really not a huge fan of the mac & cheese. The original sandwich was just okay. It was nothing special. I may have been spoiled from having the smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz the day before, but I was not impressed. The burger was my favorite of all! I loved the bread that it came in and it was a good sized burger.Overall, I really was not impressed. For the price, I really expected more out of the place. I definitely would not recommend you go to the place for a smoked meat experience. There are many different deli's such as Schwartz near the area for a much cheaper price and better quality. I'm providing the three stars for service, the burger and the ambiance of the place.**UPDATE** Per the comment from the business owner, the review I posted is associated with the correct establishment."
/user_details?userid=HMUnp55Q8_vxIEPl1V0W_g,Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"This place is named after the person who invented the Reuben sandwich.Technically, the founder worked over at Schwartz's where the lines are long.But there are many fine smoked beef establishments in Montreal including this one. Eating in any of the top twenty will get you something decent.At smoked beef places, do your ordering with care, even if everything is going to be good.What is the issue?This more than any restaurant I know is a ""combo"" restaurant rather than a pure ingredient restaurant.Normally, I am a straight ingredient kind of a guy.I like straight steak, straight pastrami, straight whiskey, no ice, no mixers.That is NOT how Reuben's is designed and for good reason.One of the differences between a Montreal smoked beef and an American/Irish corned beef - is that Montreal beef is dry cooked rather than boiled.This means that more of the brining chemicals stay in Montreal smoked beef than you get with the American/Irish corned beefNothing boils out into water.This gives Montreal deli an excellent taste but a very strong taste.A Reuben sandwich is a distinct local solution to the highly flavored meat.By combining smoked meat with sauerkraut, swiss cheese and bread, you give some complementary flavors to balance out the brine. WITH the trimmings, the sandwich is perfectly balanced and a delight.Without the trimmings, it is a stronger raw-er commitment.Related principles apply to their chopped liver.They do an excellent chopped liver.But since the restaurant thinks in combos -they combine the chopped liver with WONDERFUL WONDERFUL caramelized fried onions.Both ingredients are good by themselves.But the whole is greater than the sum of the parts -and a mouthful of BOTH onions and liver is definitely better than a mouthful of onions followed by a mouthful of liver.So dilute things down, mix and match and build those combos.Reuben's is a place where flavors work in teams."

The staff was pleasant and the host in front was handling everything. She did a fantastic job managing our order, everyone coming in, seating them, and even answering the phone. Finally a manager came to help but she was doing EVERYTHING. The food was fantastic. My wife got one of the burgers and I got a Reuben's sandwich. So so so good. The fries were plentiful and deliciously thin, just the way I like them. We also order some baked macaroni and cheese to start, which was the highlight of the meal. It had bacon on top, and the cheese wasn't super cheesy as it was sweet to offset the saltiness of the bacon. WOW. It was so good we went back the next morning and ordered it again. This isn't a restaurant you need to travel out of your way to go to, but if you are in the downtown area it's a definite lock-in for some dinner time eats.

So really you have half of your plate that is really good, then the other half is school cafeteria bad.Btw, I had the chopped liver sandwich and it was good. I would had more mustard and would have traded the fries for extra filling. Then there where a list of other things that made me tick:The washroom is not really great (like the doors are so low you can almost see over it) and located on the second floor.The menu is way to big. They should halve the menu at least.We arrived all having smoked meat sandwiches in our head and then second guess while looking through the seemingly endless possibilities.

It felt like this place is probably well know for being a little touristy but you get somewhat of a local experience.Food- Make sure you try the smoked meat. They really have some of the best smoked meat I tasted while in Toronto. It was so moist and fatty that it melted in my mouth. If our luggage wasn't already packed I probably would have grabbed a few pounds to take home. Service- From the moment we walked in we were helped in some way. Our server went on break during our breakfast, but we were definitely not neglected. The replacement server was attentive and even chatted with us for a few minutes. He gave us some local insight on attractions to check out and which ones to skip. Unfortunately, we were grabbing breakfast on our way to the airport so we weren't able to check anything out.

Then, through the grapevine, we became aware of Reuben's Deli & Steakhouse. We had to investigate.Though, like Schartz's, Reuben's has a significant history, (established in 1976), it has none of the old school feel. Before you even walk into the restaurant, you'll see its glowing Broadway lights from down the street. Walking in, you'll experience the cool, mellow decor, plenty of cured meats for sale, wine racks, a dessert section, and a pickling jar section. Reuben's has plenty of cozy booth and table seating, so feel free to bring a group.After a relatively short wait, our smoked sandwiches came. Generally, their ""Famous Super Sandwich"" sticks to the smoked meat basics: copious amounts of smoked brisket, between two thin slices of rye bread, with yellow mustard. Thankfully, Reuben's answered my prayers, left tradition, and added what these sandwiches beg for; Swiss cheese! If we were to compare Reuben's sandwich to the classic Schwartz's, Reuben's is the clear winner. Sure, they add Swiss cheese, (bless their souls), but how they really win is by serving up smoked brisket that so wonderfully juicy that it makes a Schwartz sandwich seem like the Sahara. And what else is a smoked meat sandwich but a vehicle to serve you up irresponsible amounts of meat.The sandwich also comes with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle.You'll pay a bit more for dinner at Reuben's, but take my word for it, you'll eat better. Whenever I'm in the city next, I'm heading straight back to see what else they've got to offer."

I'll also admit that the food is pretty decent. All these components point towards a 4-star rating.However, I ordered their ""famous"" smoked meat sandwich for $15.99 and it just did not compare to the ones i've had at Schwartz's or Main's. The meat was tender, but it lacked a certain depth of flavor, even after requesting the ""fattty"" smoked meat. Also, the $15.99 price point, is a bit steeper than what you would find elsewhere.Reuben's is nice with comfortable seating and attentive waitstaff. However, it is slightly tourist-centered and their pricing reflects this. Reuben's is still a good dining option in the area. Their dessert display is also quite impressive.***3.5 stars***"

Dropped by Friday after midnight and they warmly welcomed us, waiter was very professional and quick. Lets just say this is our first meal this revisit, and one of our best!We ordered the smoked meat ""chop-chop poutine"" and their smoked meat 10oz sandwich which was humongous and came with a boatload of fries and a small cup of coleslaw along with a large half pickle. If you imagine Schwartsz but 3x the size of one, then that's how big Reubens smoked meat sandwich was. Not only the size but the taste was phenomenal, for both dishes (poutine was huge as well). Curds were good, gravy was spread evenly, and the smoked meat on the sandwich and on the poutine were a blast of flavour.Love that they were open late so that we were able to walk here hungry from our hotel nearby and enjoy a magnificent meal!"

I had to try smoked meat and poutine before heading back to Alberta...this place did not disappoint. Sam at the bar was very personable, he shared a few of his personal favourites, but I kept to what brought me there in the first place. Smoked meat and poutine. Overall, stellar service, great menu and a definite must when in Montreal.I had to go back a second time. This time I had the bbq short rib poutine. Not nearly the meat/fries ratio compared to the smoked meat poutine the day before. Still good, but would not have returned had this been my first experience. Just okay."

/user_details?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg,Paul V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"Gah, I hate being the odd man out, but my experience at Reuben's could have been better. Maybe it's because I was using it as a point of comparison to Schwartz's (yelp.com/biz/schwartzs-m…), but I can't quite say with confidence that a trip to Reuben's is worth going out of your way. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Now, one thing I will say is that Reuben's is designed to funnel large quantities of people even on the busiest of days. You're sitting here in the most touristy part of town, so you're already in the zone for a crowd, but Reuben's will have you seated quickly. The menu? Colossal, and even the most picky eaters will find something that suits them. In my case, the bartender was pleasant and attentive without being overbearing. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Sure, my smoked meat sandwich at nearby Schwartz's was half the cost of my $16.00 smoked meat sandwich here at Reuben's, but it was also half the sandwich. Have a look at this beast:yelp.com/user_local_phot…That's easily two sandwiches and two portions of fries. For $16.00? That's fair. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?And herein came the problem. Reuben's can do it all, as is evident by their menu, but what that often leads to is everything being done not quite to the optimal standard. Case in point was my sandwich, which, to be honest, wasn't all that good. The smoked meat must have been slow cooked in a crock pot as opposed to smoked because the whole thing was so overcooked that it fell apart into a bit of a salty mush. Combined with standard bread, standard, boring fries, and a pickle, and I honestly wasn't too keen to the point where I didn't even finish the meal. Up the quality of the meat, up the quality of the bread, and up the quality of the fries, and you'd have a brilliant sandwich. In the meantime? I wasn't a fan. No Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Schwartz's is better head to toe when it comes to smoked meat sandwiches. No Star Granted."

Not bad but no not for me.  The steaming process they apply after smoking definitely makes it soft/tender as they described it but the smoked flavor is maybe lost or reduced in this process.

We had a chop-chop poutine (with minced smoked meat), a smoked meat sandwich plate and a Jack Daniel BBQ beef rib pizza.  I never liked poutine but this one was sooo good. Totally changed my negative impression of poutine, so flavorful. Will come again to have it. For the smoked meat sandwich, we go to Schwartz's Deli regularly, and we both like Schwartz more. Beef rib pizza was very good. I like the sauce and big chunks of beef. Just wonderful.I noticed they have so many choices of cake as dessert. You can have a slice or the whole cake. they'd love to pack it for you if you have no room left. I think the price for dessert is a bit high. The service was excellent. Overall recommended."

Walking around St Catherine and trying to avoid the hail, we decided to stop in here for breakfast. The restaurant was huge but honestly, not super clean. The floor was a mess and it made me wonder about how it looks by dinner. The breakfast menu was huge. I ended up getting a regular breakfast with smoked meat while my dining partner got an omelette with smoked meat. I have to say I enjoyed this smoked meat better than other places we've tried it in Montreal. The breakfast was a bit greasy but the addition of the smoked meat was very nice. There are so many places to eat in the area that I probably won't stop in again but if you're looking for some good smoked meat then I recommend popping in. No wait time and you can even visit their deli section and get some smoked meat to go."

The taste just wasn't there either as I could not tell if I was eating smoked meat or if I was eating out of the box deli cold cut.The Mac and cheese could've been amazing but for some reason the chef decided sugar would be a good idea. It could've worked, but the line was crossed a teaspoon ago. Save your money and go to Schwartz"
/user_details?userid=0sl4I8R7znWXp_K4A0nZ_w,Eric T.,"Fort Worth, TX",3 star rating,"Food portion sizes that are offered by Reuben's are exceptionally big & reasonably priced for a downtown restaurant venue. Considering the location to St. Catherines Avenue & the ton of other restaurants, boutiques and shopping venues, expect at least a 25% markup on prices. But like most downtown areas anywhere in the world, this is expected. No big deal.No major issues with the food. My wife & I wanted to eat something light, so we chose a pepperoni flatbread that was more of a reluctant choice more than anything else. We originally wanted the flatbread that had the green peppers and mushrooms. When I requested that the flatbread have the mushrooms on one side and the pepperoni on the other, our server indicated that the kitchen staff would ""freak out"" if they saw our request. Are you serious? I almost wanted to ask the server if this would take an additional 10 seconds out of their busy day to accommodate this request, yet I held back in saying so. Meanwhile, a server at the table adjacent to us took a request to add something with their poutine entree. Of course, you hear some loud hoots & hollering within the kitchen from the kitchen staff possibly in protest due to a slightly different poutine variety. Other than the kitchen staff having feelings toward requests from the restaurant's patrons, Reuben's is a pretty good place. 4 stars for the venue's presentation, 4 stars for the server's promptness and etiquette, yet 2 stars for the kitchen staff being way too sensitive in accepting requests (or somewhat lack thereof) from paying customers.Nonetheless, I would return to Reuben's. Just have to do so with an empty stomach. They will fill you up to the eyeballs in good food."

The service was quick despite it being fairly packed. We went on an early Saturday evening and when we left there was a long line so keep that in mind. The desserts looked so good but we were in a deep food coma from how much we ate. The only downside to eating here is the level of noise. It got pretty loud and my friend and I were speaking in raised voices to hear each other. But apart from that it was an enjoyable experience.

I cheated on my keto/low-carb diet MULTIPLE TIMES for this fuggin sandwich and I don't regret it for one second. Except for that one time they were out of the dark pumpernickel bread...that was lame. Always ask if they have the dark bread.

I used to stick with the brisket but lately their burgers have been off the hook. All the buns are baked fresh that morning and sourced from a local MTL bakery, all the beef aged and of good quality, and all of their sauces and marinades are done in house. Its a family business and an MTL institution so they know exactly what they're doing. Last time I was there I wanted to get a burger to go since I was staying nearby and the manager Mike was really helpful in going through the menu with me. Told me about their Toronto expansion which should get all GTA brisket/pastrami lovers excited.

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"FIRST OF ALL, if you're posting a review here make sure you at the RIGHT address! There are two Reubens within 2 blocks of each other on the same street. Did you go down a flight of stairs when going in? Then you're at the WRONG Reubens. A lot of reviewers have been poorly observant in this regard.DECOR :When you walk in you're greeted by a countless number of slabs of smoke meat that seem to screaming at you to eat them right then and there. You're always welcomed by a charming hostess that will inquire how many you are during your visit. While you wait, the odds are the place is full of people, whether it is for lunch or supper, this place is more popular than a Bon Jovi concert. There's a long nicely made bar counter that stretches across the joint where single seats can be used by single visitors. The bunks are large and comfortable while the space to walk is slightly restrictive by the amount of traffic. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable despite the chaos of it all.FOOD : This is MY smoke meat join of choice. I've been given a lot of flak by friends over the years for preferring Reubens over Schwartz but I stand firm in my position that Reubens is simply better than Schwartz. It's hard not to compare the two, particularly when talking about the best smoked meat in Montreal, yet they are SO different that I can't help love Reubens so much more.Firstly, Reubens can accommodate more people, I'm not a fan of Schwartz in this regard. It's become too touristy and the line-ups during specific moments in the day can be pretty ridiculous. No one wants to wait 30 minutes, outside during winter to sit down to eat a smoked meat sandwich.Secondly, my sandwiches at Reubens have always been perfect. I've never gotten a mediocre cut that was fatty or dry. I've gotten a few mediocre sandwiches over the years when at Schwartz. Never at Reubens. Reubens sandwiches are moist and plump, while Schwartz can sometimes be very dry.While Reubens offers a multitude of choices to eat, they definitely specialize in smoked meat. My personal favorite is the Euro, a ridiculously huge portion of smoked meat (offered also in lean cuts) between kaiser buns and Swiss cheese. Yet you can select with other variety of smoke meat sandwiches available. They also have other things on the menu that I've never really tried beyond their desert. Their caramel cheesecake is fantastic. (Check pictures).Also, their Onion rings are out of this world. Try it with their Jack BBQ sauce!PRICE :Quality is rarely cheap in Montreal. Their Super Sandwich is about 15$. However, the potions are huge. If you're willing to pay a bit more, you'll get what you deserve and I recommend this sacrifice for some heavenly smoked meat. You won't be leaving this joint craving more food.SERVICE : I've heard some stories about mediocre service but I've never been disappointed. Service is LIGHTNING quick and efficient. Refills can sometimes take awhile but let's be honest, people need to get their FOOD ASAP! This place smells awesome, people come in hungry, they are immediately suffering with a lack of smoke meat in their mouth. The service must feed the hungry... not quench the thirst of the thirsty,Joking aside, the service is pretty solid,If you're new to Montreal or new to Reubens, check this place out, you won't be disappointed. It's been a personal favorite of mine for well over a decade!However, kindly note, this DOES NOT apply if you go to the other Reubens. It's a completely different and mediocre experience. If you're going down stairs, STOP, you're not at the right Reubens. There should be a huge Second Cup sign beside this resto about 2 blocks away. Head there instead.PROTIP : They will not allow you to sit down unless everyone is there, so if you have tardy folks, inform everyone so you're not standing there dumbly for 10-15 minutes while you wait with a bunch of other people."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: In the heart of downtown MTL - on Ste. Catherine. Street parking is available [metered]. The closest subway is probably Peel [green line].The place: My friends and I stopped here around 11:30pm following our latest U2 extravaganza because well, we are famished. Even though there were several patrons, we didn't have to wait for a table. The space itself is ordinary and a little dark. They've got an upstairs but I'm not sure if there's seating up there or if it's just where the washrooms are located. The goods: The menu offers a good variety of options but I had a rare hankering for smoked meat. Unfortunately, the only option they had on the menu was for a huge portion that I'd say, no one person can eat solo (unless you're a big beefy man - then you're good). My friend and I decided to share the platter so we basically each had a half of the smoked meat sandwich and split the fries. I enjoyed the meat. The fries were good though if memory serves, they weren't of the home made variety. Service: Great - our waiter was really nice and friendly.Price point: A little spendier than some places, but Reubens is catering to a large tourist population so not surprising. This is a good go-to spot if you're in need of sustenance in the middle of the night =-D"

The smoked meat tasted more like bologna/salami and the poutine was very underwhelming. We ordered the two signature sandwiches, which were very overpriced, and we were visiting from NYC, so that's saying a lot.The service was mediocre, they forgot to bring one of the appetizers and my boyfriend had to eat it while his food got cold. They charge for refills on soda and don't even fill the glass to the top.The only redeeming part of the meal was the beef wontons, those happened to be delicious!Definitely felt like a tourist trap, wouldn't recommend."

/user_details?userid=lnntC56cwlpNJS345jluIg,Joyce O.,"Cote Saint-Luc, Canada",1 star rating,"Visit was July 31. Should have realized how the customer is NOT a priority when I walked-in alone one afternoon - way after lunch time and much too early for dinner, yet the din of extra loud, boisterous conversation and heavily blaring music almost knocked me over, so I asked for a quieter spot, pointing-out two or three possibilities to the server who said she'd have to ask her manager, She came back and said ""NO"". Imagine!  At that point I should have seen the signs and walked-out, but I was too hot and tired and hungry, so I stayed. Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Shocked at the prices while perusing the menu I asked if I could not have just a regular-sized smoked meat sandwich instead of an $18.95 supersized one. Yes, it was available, at $14.95, but not on the menu!!! With a soft drink at $3.99 we were at $19.00 plus tax and tip = $25.00. I could have had a fine meal at a classy restaurant  with no abuse for that amount. Now for the food. People who know nothing about food have rated it good. As a foodie and longtime lover of smoked meat I know my stuff and can tell you the EVERYTHING was wrong with this meat!!! It was the saltiest smoked meat I had ever eaten, even in a fast-food type of joint. It was not tender, but rather rubbery and pink instead of red. The slices were so thin that even if it had tasted good it would have been bad. They obviously do not employ a smoked meat cutter. So, to conclude, if it's wonderful Montreal smoked meat you crave, please do yourself a favour and go elsewhere for it. Try George's in Laval or Schwartz's on St. Laurent.***N.B. Addendum: To reply to Annie's comment - I know the other restaurant well, and no, it was indeed HER location and I have the bill and receipt to prove same. Amazing how people who offer shoddy service and inferior food also take no accountability for same!!!"

I had heard of Ruebens and knew that we'd have a filling and yummy meal - we were just worried about how quickly we could get in and out. We stopped into Ruebens on the walk back to our hotel around 2 pm. The wait was 5 minutes, which already sort of worried us - the night before, our dinner in Old Montreal was 3 hours start to finish. We couldn't risk that! We were seated and our hostess was quick and abrupt with us, which we really didn't mind. We reviewed the menu and quickly settled on the Big Bang (medium, based on the waitress's recommendation). It was out at our table within 15 minutes and it was PHENOMENAL. My boyfriend doesn't love deli meat but he loved this! The meat was so tender and buttery, I'd never had anything like it before. Slightly warm, fatty, and hearty all at the same time. I wasn't going to eat as much as I did, but holy crap - so good. It was served with sliced white toast, a massive mound of crispy fries, and a really yummy vinegar based coleslaw (I enjoyed it; more of a tang, not sweet, and felt very light). We wrapped up at 2:40, keeping us right on schedule! Such a positive experience, we're keeping it on the docket for the next time we're in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=1jwqXiKhmb2pfWlhDJXT2w,Jeffrey B.,"Brea, CA",3 star rating,"Sorry to be a killjoy, Montreal, but if Reuben's Deli and Steakhouse is representative of what to expect from this highly touted icon of smoked meat excellence, I burp in your general direction. Overly spiced mush meat, akin to the guts of a Vienna sausage, was the closest comparison I could conjure up after my first bite into their signature sandwich. I'd read all of the comparisons between the combatants battling for supremacy amongst the smoked meat specialty restaurants in the city and could hardly wait to try one of the best rated venues. At $18 + dollars for a 10oz. pile on rye (with a bigger pile of kinda cold fries and a dead kosher pickle) I guess I was more stunned than bummed that the meat had no texture. I repeat, NO TEXTURE! At first I wanted to praise how tender and juicy the meat, but quickly realized that tender was not the correct description. Softened butter has as much for my teeth to chew as this highly pickled, reddish, multi-layered mass, with only a visual meat-like grain. I tried and tried to like it, but kept asking myself, ""Is this really good?"" Deep in my memory bank I recalled as a kid a school friend I admired whose lunch always included little Vienna Sausages out of a can. I asked my mother to buy some and put them in my lunch, too. The following day at lunch I proudly pulled out my little can, opened them up and took a bite. It was mushy, pickled-tasting,spicy, and once swallowed made me burp! If I'd only known then, it was just like Reuben's Smoked Meat!In answer to the owner's question: ""are you sure you visited our Catherine St. restaurant?""Yes, indeed your restaurant, and your food!""I do not doubt your using high quality ingredients.However, the preparation and its results were what was so deeply disconcerting. If what I was served is the epitome of Montreal's smoked meat craze, then I believe its adulation is more hype than culinary based praise!To what standard of excellence do I compare Rueben's smoked meat? In a word, Katz's.Their meats are prepared with as much or more attention to the quality of ingredients but the preparation and results are like comparing an over-cooked, crockpot roast to a perfectly grilled medium rare tomahawk ribeye steak. One is a thrilling treat, the other, a disappointing Sunday supper at Aunt Hazel's house."

You walk by Reuben's and ingots of smoked meat are lying there staring at you through the windows like puppies in a pet store. You can't take it anymore. The entrance door is pulled. The interior is very woodsy which evokes the idea of a nice smoky barbecue. The illuminated bottles of liquor on the shelves and the walls of wine show that this place isn't taking it lightly. My waiter was a friendly and rotund man that remained very professional throughout the whole time. I had the obvious intentions to try the smoked meat but another item on the menu caught my attention - kobe sliders. It didn't take too long before they brought me the 3 miniature hamburgers. Juicy tomatoes, tangy pickles, and beefy wagyu, it was simple but tasty. Although, the patties were a bit dry and they could have been more juicy considering the fact that wagyu beef has more fat and marbling.

The bread is grilled with tons of butter, and the sandwich is stuffed with sky high meat, melty cheese and served with awesome coleslaw on the side.

Our server came shortly after being seated and let me just say, he didn't smile once during the whole time we dined. The beef brisket wonton appetizer is a must! We loved it as well as the dipping sauce. We are not drinkers so we both ordered pops (as we usually do) and we were shocked they don't offer free refills! Especially when your paying 20-40 per entree. I haven't been to a restaurant that doesn't offer this. How much can pop be?? Anyway. The meals came and my wife's reaction was, ""average at best"". From the reviews, pricing and atmosphere I too would have expected better.  The total bill for the two of us was $100 and quite honestly I didn't even want to tip as there was really no customer service which is what you expect in 2018.

We started with Old Fashioned Chopped Liver which was very nice, especially with the crispy onions. My wife went with the Southern Crisp Chicken Tender Salad which we felt was a bit too sweet. I don't mind a BBQ ranch dressing, but this one was missing a flavour note. Maybe not enough acid. It was OK, but we were hoping for better. I went with the Original Reuben Sandwich with poutine and a side of coleslaw. The smoked meat was tender and juicy, the bread was crispy, and the melted cheese was gooey! And the coleslaw was tangy and crunchy!

Honestly , according to my opinion , the smokemeat is better than the famous Schwartz in Montreal , which I believe is just overrated based on the historical factor. The fries are similar to Deville as they are given in a sharp and thin size seasoned with salt perfect. The salad that came with my plate was juicy --not super great but I liked it so much I still finished it ! Pickles is special --sweet and sour.I can't say too much about the club sandwich that my date took. I had a bite and I can easily tell that it was made out of quality chicken and bacon. The plate is around 15$ and let me be honest , pretty much anyone would be filled up after such a plate. Just a heads up , you will be scared as how big the plate actually is.Service : waiter was fast and efficient . Requested him for two or three of my demands and he served me in no time . Note that we came here around 11pm during the weekend after a hockey game --restaurant was still 3/4 packed , and yet, I did get served properly and I am satisfied . Again, like I said, expect the same level of quality in service as compared to Deville--the owners have done a great job with this restaurant and this is one of the reasons why this place is so popular amongst local and tourists! Last thing , note that your plates will arrive fast, as their team are always prepare and I believe that some stuff are pre-cooked a couple hours before as we have gotten our plates within less than 10 mins."

The meal itself was well presented and obviously delicious. My boyfriend had the tribes, which was the most delicious Reuben we have ever tried. Seriously, order the Reuben! The decor of the restaurant was awesome. It had a mural of different aspects of life in Montreal. The light were dim and made the restaurant feel very cozy. The music was a bit odd they were playing top 40 hits. I think they could do a bit better with the music selection. The service was good. We had a very nice waiter who was funny and sweet. He made sure we felt comfortable and was very relatable. He took a bit long to give us our check and forgot our drinks, but I can't blame him; the restaurant is very busy most of the time."
/user_details?userid=QnvI1-V9pqEzGfMcIILh4A,John Paul F.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Reuben's smoked meat salad is the King of Salads. I want it the first time I set eyes on it on the menu, but it's sold out. I don't give up, though. The next time, a little earlier in the night, I'm luckier. I figure it will be good, but I don't really know what to expect. It arrives shaped like Devil's Tower, really only very slightly smaller, and when I dig into it, it tumbles over itself into a giant heap of meat and thousand island dressing and shredded greens. It needs every centimeter of platter circumference to keep off the table. Instead of leaden, not-worth-the-calories fries to accompany my meat, I get a hearty salad of Brussels sprouts and kale and pickles and itty bitty cheese cubes. If that's not enough, there's a good sized heap of fried onion strings on top. The thin breading on the strings and the gram or two of sugar in the thousand island won't even pop one out of ketosis, I can say from experience. Not that you have to be low carb to love this salad; I'm done with low carb for now, but I got the salad tonight anyway (for the third time) because it's just that good."

/user_details?userid=2ae8OQlju4PRT7Daa3HSaw,Araxie Y.,"Malden, MA",2 star rating,"First off, we read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try during lunch. The location is a bit chaotic and crowded but luckily we made it in just before the lunch rush. We were seated and began by moving our seats again simply out of comfort. We were pushed into a corner and felt awkward. The interior is alright, it's clean and well lit, really unsure what the style or theme is? The floors are atrocious and dirty though! The hostess was quite nice and warm, the waitress on the other hand.. Really rude and uninterested. We ordered our drinks and it came within 15 mins. At this point the lunch rush rolled in....The food was terribly meh, the burger had no flavor at all. I can't fathom the prices for this dive quantity food. Mind you, we ordered cocktails -- half the drink was missing. When we asked why there was so little, she said that's how it comes. No it really isn't. Soda refills aren't free. What? Is that a joke? That is just mind-boggling. Do they realize it costs like 80 cents for the mixture ?! We got water instead. How embarrassing! It took the waitress so much time to bring us the check, my father fell asleep. Truly! I've never felt so uncomfortable and betrayed after spending this much money. I was disgusted to even leave a tip, but felt obligated as a human being. My advice, have better service and more flavorful food. I think the sandwich my mother had (NY Steak) was probably the only liked meal. Again, so overpriced and such a rude staff."

Who even goes to Montreal for sushi anyways? Smoked meat is where's it's at and Reuben's has it. I've also been to Schwartz before, but this place does the mouth and tummy just right too if you're closer downtown. The sandwiches generally come with coleslaw, a pickle, and fries which were decent. But the sandwich itself is a monster. In taste and portion. Smoked Meat Sandwich (the famous one) :I have no clue how they managed to stuff so much meat in there and still cut it in half.. Now that takes skill. And the meat itself was glooooorious, especially for a meat person like me.  Tuna Melt: This was also really, REALLY good. The cheese just melts on the tuna with a slice of tomato inside, it was just heavenly. The service is also amazing here. You get greeted by beautiful hostesses and our server was lovely and attentive. It is a bit on the pricey side, but it's downtown Montreal so comeon. PS. During our visit, there was an elder woman sitting alone, picking at her plate a piece of chicken at a time. Many of servers seemed very friendly to her so I took it she was a regular. At the end of her meal, the servers all surprised her with a cake on the house because i believe was her birthday. It was one of the cutest things I've seen, and for that this restaurant deserves much more than a 5/5. You guys are amazing!"

I am sure that today's visit was at the closer to Rue Peel, which is smack in the middle of the shopping district crowds.Of course, I had the smoked meat. Why have anything else? It comes piled medium high on rye bread with mustard and swiss cheese, with a big pile of fries, a pot of cole slaw and a pickle. It was good, but I'll be honest, I prefer spicy brown mustard to the yellow mustard they offer here. No worries, it was still excellent and a whole lot of food. Too much to be able to even consider splitting a piece of the delicious looking carrot cake.Prices are moderate, but it's a fancy sit down restaurant with real service and tablecloths. Don't tell anyone, but smoked meat is a whole lot similar to pastrami."

The menu had a little bit of everything so between the four of us, we had a schizophrenic table. We were told that when in Montreal, we must have a smoked meat sandwich so that is what I ordered. It was good, not great, but good. The lunch special comes with a soup and I really enjoyed the lentil. It was a generous portion. My daughter ordered poutine and it was also good.  My husband had a pasta dish that he liked and my son had a chicken entree that he couldn't finish.

Everything about the sandwich was amazing right down to the secret sauce that I loved so much! The coleslaw was also very good - not too creamy and nothing like a regular coleslaw. I also poutined my fries and I do not regret my decision. Although this place won't be good for you if you're on a diet but I do suggest you should come here for your cheat day and indulge! I highly recommend this place! I enjoyed my meal so much I forced my bf to come here for the second time during our trip!

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're downtown and starving then come to Reuben's.  There are two locations downtown.  The other one is in a basement by McGill College and feels a little more run down than this location.  This is the one I always come to when I want Reuben's.  Their portions are enormous and you will not be hungry when you're done here.  The quality of the food is also pretty good and I always enjoy myself here.I usually go for the smoked meat or burgers here.  The hamburger is always massive and adequately juicy.  The smoked meat is also another reliable choice.  It is not my favourite Montreal smoked meat but it is good enough and they give you a lot of meat.  Admittedly their fries aren't the greatest you will ever have.  I tend to prefer French fries that have a thicker cut and are double fried.  The fries here are too thin and kind of soggy almost.Despite the fact I've been here many times I have never tried the desserts because I'm usually too full at this point.  In looking at the dessert case though it seems you can expect huge portions.  They have your typical variety of cakes (strawberry cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc).Given its prime location Reuben's is very popular and generally quite busy.  You sometimes might have to wait for a table but if you're a small group it generally isn't too long.  Once you're seated service is generally very speedy.  The last time I went it was too slow for my liking but this was the first time (after many visits) that I have ever had a problem so it must have been an off night.It is slightly on the pricy side considering that they are more of a casual kind of place but that's downtown for you.  That being said it is probably one of the better options when you're downtown.  If you're in the area then you should definitely consider coming here to satusfy your hunger."

Maybe we are just too used to fast paced places, where they give a time frame and it's on time or sooner. Over all, very disappointing and too much of an American restaurant in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=iCTxKlCXwCPr6vqBoO1yUg,Amanda S.,"Burlington, VT",2 star rating,"Dissapointing. I ordered the Montréal Smoked Meat Sliders, which I pointed to as I ordered. The food came and I was served the Kobe beef sliders. When I asked the server if it was the smoked meat sliders he said no and seemed confused. I told him I had asked for the other sliders. He then offered to ""bring me a plate with a pile of smoke meat"". I said no, I'd prefer the whole meal because they have different toppings and sides. Mistakes happen, but it was a bizarre offer. My second issue was that the correct sliders came, but I was disappointed again because they were covered in mustard, which wasn't listed on the menu. I specifically ordered these because I don't like mustard and almost all the other sandwiches listed mustard. The few bites of meat that I did end up eating was very good. Bummer :("

The Montreal Smoked Meat is DIVINE, as is the horseradish, and cheese that comes in it. Solid coleslaw, okay poutine.I wouldn't order anything else, to be honest. If you're going to Reuben's, you're going there for the Smoked Meat.Could definitely upgrade the atmosphere with a face lift - maybe have a little more light as it was very dark. Just a thought :)"

It turned out to be so good that we cam back here almost every day we were in town. The décor is modern deli, with plenty of seating and a long counter filled with all sorts of scrumptuous looking desserts to tempt you.In the city that gave it's name to Montreal Smoked Meat, you either do it well or don't do it at all. Reuben's does it really well. I had the smoked meat and eggs my first morning, just to test them and see if they were good enough. They are. The meat is wonderful (get the fat, don't get the lean) and breakfast portions are adequate for all but the biggest diners. The next visit I had the Reuben's Omelette with smoked meat and cheese - delicious and filling! On the last visit I had the menagerie skillet - plenty of deliciousness - but I couldn't finish it was so big.Food comes quickly here, service is quick and crisp, and we didn't have any problems in 3 visits.My recommendation - take some meat to go after you've filled up!"

I usually order the Builder's platter which comes with a mound of machine sliced smoked meat{ Fatty of course} 4 slices of fresh and sturdy rye,fries ,slaw and half a pickle but this time I opted for a pound of fatty,well seasoned with some crisry ends meat. My wife usually opts for the Reuben spaghetti with extra cheese and while still a hearty and tasty entree we've found that they have cut back on the actual smoked meat ends that made this dish so decadent and substituted minced meat to make up the Bolognase sauce...disappointing but there is still enough smoked meat to make it a worth while entree.Reubens's menu covers all that you would expect in this slick and popular fast ,casual concept and the food has never been anything less than good and at a good price.....but for the true Montreal Smoked meat experience you have to at least try the always packed Schwartz's before the new owners morph it into ..........Reuben's."

When we walked down the stairs, we were transported into a typical Deli that could have been in New York, or Chicago. Our waitress was older, gray and just as condescending as a New Yorker would have been. The deli fare was very good. My wife enjoyed the Pastrami Reuben, with fries. It was delicious and very authentic, piled high with lean pastrami. We were both stuffed by the time we were done and the bill was much less than in New York."
/user_details?userid=Jbvk_EtNS303eBobAPl6tg,Stefan W.,"Calgary, Canada",2 star rating,"Ideally located on St Catherine's, Reubens promises excellent smoked meat but delivers less than that. While the food is certainly tasty (particularly their signature Jack Daniels BBQ pulled beef and their chipotle salad dressing), you will absolutely find your experience underwhelming and overpriced. I had the ""Original 76"" from the weekday Business Lunch menu. Supposedly this is a reuben and you would expect as much given the restaurant name. However, it is served on a dry brioche bun rather than marble rye and does not include Russian dressing or sauerkraut; which to me, means it's not a reuben. The reuben itself originated in the US; debatable whether it came specifically from a NY deli or a Russian small business owner from Nebraska. Either way. I'm confused as to why this place claims to have the original, yet they did not invent it. Was supposed to come with 8oz of smoked meat and appeared to be less. Sandwich was cold and cheese not melted. Mediocre coleslaw and passable fries; $15. Pass on this. Clearly the debate is settled--the reuben did not originate at Reuben's.The smoked meat was not the best I've has in Montreal. Schwartz's is better though I imagine their are better choices out there. Also on the lunch menu were the BBQ beef tacos which, while quite delicious, were overpriced at $18, coming with three small tacos and a salad. However I must admit the quality of the pulled beef is quite good. Maybe this is not your stop if you're seeking smoked meat, but it might hit the spot if you're in the area."

/user_details?userid=V6MsTK2hkVOMqilpcZpb1A,Yu Z.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my fave places in Montreal!! There are 2 Reuben's on Ste-Catherine's, but this one is the classier/chic restaurant with a massive menu from the classic smoked meat to pizza/pasta, burgers, steaks and salads.The place is generally busy, but I've never had to wait in line to get seated. Even if it gets a little bit loud during the dinner hours, but I actually enjoy a busy and lively restaurant over the contrary. Loads of tourists, but locals go here to!Portions are huge, you'll get more than enough for your hunger I promise. All the ingredients they use are fresh and tasty. Just go with your feels while you're reading the menu and you're probably not making a bad decision. I've tried most of their sandwiches/burgers and liked all of them! However I've never tried the steaks since I think for the same price range I could get a better plate at Montreal's many other famous steakhouses.If you're new to Mtl's smoked meat, order the Builder's plate. You get to make you're own sandwich from a full plate of meat with 4 slices of bread, pickles, coleslaw and fries! ***TIP: I find the smoked meat from the Builder's plate to be better quality compared to the meat in the sandwiches.Salads are great and come in huge portions as well, strongly recommended.Desserts are a MUST. Make room for the strawberry cheesecake please, it tastes light and fluffy, definitively not overwhelming like the ones you normally get.Price: A little expensive, but since it is located at the heart of downtown, just next to Quartier des Spectacles, the higher pricing is justifiable. Service is hit or miss, because the waiter I usually get makes me quite uncomfortable (isn't really helpful and attitude is sometimes condescending/rude). Whenever I get seated at his tables, I don't expect my water to be refilled unless I ask the busboy, and he rarely comes to check if everything is alright. Even if I am not a fan of the service, I love the food/location/atmosphere of Reuben's, and these are more than enough reasons for me to come back again and again. **This is not true for all the waiters! Everybody can have a bad day from times to times, I can understand.I've been here for brunch too, and I like it as much as I like the dinner. Prices are very good as well, I recommend the skillets."
/user_details?userid=QlRsVCCytArycuuKSyUBLg,Shirley L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I know the big place for smoked meat is Schwartz's, but it's a little bit out of the way from the main downtown area. We chose to try Reuben's because the location worked a lot better for us. Since it is located near the main shopping area on Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest, it was super busy when we visited on a Sunday afternoon around 1 PM. Everyone working there seems to speak very good English compared to a lot of places, and I believe that might be because a lot of the patrons are tourists. Although there were a lot of people inside, they moved through the queue pretty quickly, and it didn't feel like we had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated in a booth.Our waitress was super nice and friendly, and came around at regular intervals to check if we needed drink refills or wanted any water. Between three people, we ordered the Original Reuben Sandwich ($15.99), the Turkey Melt ($13.99), and the Chop-Chop Poutine ($9.49). The prices are considered pretty high for lunch, but the portions you get are SO HUGE. The Reuben sandwich comes with 1/2 lb. of smoked meat inside! We were all incredibly stuffed after our meal. We all enjoyed the Reuben sandwich and agreed that the smoked meat was great, it was moist, flavourful, and very hearty and filling. The turkey melt on the other hand was just okay though, the turkey was actually a little bit dry and I wasn't as impressed with it. The poutine was fantastic though. It comes topped with cheese curds as usual but also with chunks of smoked meat brisket, which really add another level of flavour to the poutine overall. The saltiness of the meat mixes so well with the cheese and gravy... so so delicious. Poutine + smoked meat, it's like killing two birds with one stone... it just doesn't get any more authentic Montreal than this! I will say that by the end of it, it started to feel a little bit too salty though. But overall I still thoroughly enjoyed the poutine and would recommend trying it if you are at Reuben's!I thought the decor was also really cute. It's got kind of an old school diner vibe, albeit much shinier and in a much more commercialized way. It's pretty big and spacious though, and you will feel comfortable while eating there. Although I still want to give Schwartz's a try, I can attest that you won't go wrong by choosing to eat at Reuben's. The smoked meat is great, the service is great, and the environment is great!"

Atmosphere: The place is warm, cosy, and bustling.  It usually full of people, from young couples, to business men on their lunch hour, to families and group gatherings.  You'll love eating at Rubens, simply because the most enduring testament to it's quality is it's busy dinning room.  Wood covered walls, and wine on display, leather booths, and polished wood tables all make for a comfortable dining experience.Service: This is perhaps one of the most distinguishing attributes of Ruben's Deli.  The staff is incredibly (incredibly) professional! Having become an at-least-once-a-month-type-regular to Ruben's, I have still to have a bad experience.  The staff know their trade, and do it very well.  Top notch personalities, engaging, and charming - they know the menu and are always ready to make suggestions and accommodations.  It is also a great sign that the staff does not turn over very often, and so expect to see familiar faces if you start coming often.Food: You go to Ruben's to EAT!  Indeed, the food is a little on the heavy side in the sense that it centre's on steak's, smoked meats, and burgers - but if you must indulge, do so here.  Ruben's offerings satiate hunger and please the eye in a double-whammy that would leave many other restaurants wanting.  The menu also has delicious salad choices, pasta dishes, and the aforementioned burgers (a MUST try is the bierhoff burger witch is toped with a ketchup / beer sauce and / or the Black Jack with comes with caramelized onions and Jack Daniels sauce.)  A full bar is at hand and for desert loves (here's lookin' at you ladies) you will absolutely squirm in your seats for Ruben's carrot cheese cake, their blue berry cheese cake, or their hot fudge brownie with walnuts and the biggest heap of vanilla ice cream this side of the boarder.a Montreal classicEat'n Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=AqD5aVrPDSn-ed-F7LBm9Q,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Rueben's specializes in delicacy typical to my hometown of NYC: smoked meat. It's similar to our pastrami, except that brisket it used leading to a slightly fatty end product. I found it to be lighter and less salty than most New York renditions and must admit I generally prefer this style. The traditional serving is with mustard on rye, where it comes piled mile high (whoops, wrong city). The ""small"" clocks in at 10 oz while the Big Bang weighs a full pound and towers almost six inches off the plate. You probably shouldn't finish either alone. Other versions include a classic Reuben with sauerkrat and swiss as well as a must try poutine edition. The space resembles sort of a cross between a bar and diner that's suitable for a hefty lunch or casual dinner.Recommended: Famous Super Sandwich, Reuben's Chop-Chop Poutine"

Reuben's is one of them.As you likely know, viande fume, or smoked meat, is one of a handful of famous Montreal foods.  It's basically a super thick, super rich, warm serving of pastrami.  What I didn't know, and almost couldn't believe, is how large a difference there is between the ""smoked meat"" you get from the world-famous Schwartz's and the ""smoked meat"" you can get at the also-famous Reuben's.Reuben's is super duper moist and tender and pinkish in color, while Schwartz's is redder, drier and more crumbly.  While Schwartz's is flavorful and excellent, it didn't cause me to roll my eyes and moan the way Reuben's did.   Reuben's extra moisture and melt-in-your-mouth texture combines with a particularly rich and fatty cut of meat to fill your mouth with joy in a way that a drier sandwich simply cannot.  In other words, I think both are great, that Reuben's is better, and that it's not close.  Having said that, there is quite a lot of (internet and real life) debate about who provides the superior sandwich, and if you're a foodie I know you're going to go to Schwartz's anyway.  Heck, in my crew there were even a couple certified foodies who said they preferred Schwartz's, one of whom said the rich, moist texture of Reuben's was a bit ""too"" close to hot dog. Another was offended that Reuben's had more expensive offerings than Schwartz's.  In any case, get your Reuben's on and join the debate!  They give you quite a few options when ordering smoked meat here; get the ""famous"" one (which is just smoked meat on rye with mustard) and ask for it ""medium fatty"" which is one level above the default but not the crazy top level which is just ""fatty.""BEST X AARON'S EVER HAD AWARD WINNER: PASTRAMI(for the pastrami in their medium fatty smoked meat sandwich)"

But the food is not like the good ole days. Fries were the frozen type and I still love the real McCoy instead of these frozen fries. My sandwich was good but all I tasted was BBQ sauce and my hands smelled like BBQ sauce for the next 2 days.  There were 2 types of cheese but could not tell there was even cheese. Shame as the bread was really good. Service was excellent. I will go back and try the smoke meat and probably give 5 star.

If you hate greasy poutine this is the place to get it! The fries are nice and crunchy and don't feel like they've been dipped in oil. In fact, you can get the poutine with smoked meat on top which is another Montreal must-try, and it's absolutely delicious! I've had both the chop-chop (smoked meat) and the pulled pork poutine. Both are great, though if you have to choose one, I'd say go for the smoked meat. I've also had the cheesecake, which they say is ""Montreal-style""... it's a bit more fluffy than typical cheesecake; worth a taste but very difficult to fit if you've had any of their huge main dishes!"

First the good: The smoked sandwich was fantastic! Great flavor! Now the not so good: When I entered, the hosts (2) were so busy talking to three guys who happen to be pro football players. One handed me a menu and I asked about the famous smoked sandwich and she looked at me as if I had two heads. I finally found it on the menu then ordered. Then a gentleman, who might've been management/owner and the woman at the cashier joined the kids in their fandom. Long story short: they didn't place my order. They were too busy 'ass-kissing' and not paying attention to their day-to-day patrons. Finally got my sandwich and they apologized but by that time, I was turned-off. I'll give Reuben's the benefit of the doubt on this one however, please, do not ignore and pay lip service to your customers regardless of fame or not."

/user_details?userid=Nl2S67CsS6RMV6BJEzHvJw,Peter G.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"God, I hate to be a buzzkill but this place isn't very good.After descending the gaudy mirror and wood paneled stairs, I thought for sure I'd end up in some wannabe Mafioso's love nest only to be met by even more fabulous ridiculous interior design. This place has to be seen to be believed. Deliberate irony is the only defense.We had fabulous service from a gentleman from Afganistan who while making our sandwiches discussed his feelings about the state of the world. He was fantastic - interesting to listen to and just so passionate about serving us what he felt was the best meat in Montreal. It so pains me that I ended up so disappointed with this place.My companion and I split both their famous Reuben and their 'classic' smoked meat sandwich. It likely goes without saying that the portions here are simply huge and a great bang for the buck is certainly to be had, at least as volume is concerned. The meat is piled stupidly high on the sandwiches making them near impossible to fit in your mouth. Don't even think about calorie counting.The meat does, as other people mentioned, melt in your mouth. Despite a rather strong smell that some complained was a tad on the foul side (it comes with the curing), it did taste good and had what I thought was an unusual amount of coriander flavor to it. But for the most part it tasted exactly like an average corned beef - absolutely no evidence of the smoking that others seem so convinced makes this place and Montreal meats so unique.It didn't help that the bread wasn't that great and quickly melted and fell apart, that the mustard lacked any kick, that the Russian dressing was devoid of tang, and that the sauerkraut was actually pretty gross. And I freaking love sauerkraut in all of its stages of carefully controlled rotting goodness.The fries were mooshy and flavorless. Having worked a frialator in a past life, I would have been ashamed to serve these to anyone. Even my gravest of enemies.  I also know from working a frialator that churning out good fries isn't hard it just requires paying attention.Other people's reviews make it clear: this place is all about the ""unique"" meat. The meat shines, above all else but that's because everything else was...well, bad. This is my honest assessment: I completely fail to see the uniqueness of this place and its product versus a traditionally prepared corned beef.  When the other aspects of your meal are taken into account the experience is average at best. It is also completely devoid of any locals. I have some theories.Can we also be clear here? Corned beef is cured in brine NOT smoked. My rudimentary understanding of physics also dictates that smoke doesn't do anything to submerged objects such as meat. If you watch your sandwich being made the meat is removed from a vat of steaming brine (liquid clearly visible). So unless the meat here goes through some baffling process of curing, smoking and curing again this is just your regular everyday corned beef - which is what it tastes like. I am doubtful smoking makes up any significant portion of the process, if at all, and even if it does none of the signs of smoking are present in the meat we were served (e.g smoky flavor, color, textural qualities).So go here if you want to be surrounded by tourists, have a dining experience with heaps of mediocre food and just OKAY corned beef that pretentiously claims to be more than it is. Next time I'm going to try Schwartz's."

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favorite if not my very favorite eatery in Montreal will get some props. Montreal is well known for its delis and its very own classic, the smoked-meat sandwich which is often copied and never ever duplicated. It is singular in taste and confection. Such institutions such as Ben's have disappeared for trifle reasons as union disputes but thankfully the ubiquitous master, Schwartz still stands and is worth the long wait lines but remains a little out of the way for the downtown dwellers. I don't hang on St-Laurent, too pretentious and packed with puerile brats driving daddy's expensive car. I hang downtown on Ste-Catherine where the fun is and when I don't want to waste time deciding where to eat I go to Reuben's.  And let's clarify that I don't mean the one on 888 Ste-Catherine but the one on 1116, the one with the art-deco inspired look.I go there A LOT. Because their food just rocks. It's deli food but a little bit more upscale. There was a time when Reuben's was just a regular Deli with awesome deli food then something happened and it went upscale but kept the taste. They used to have old school filet mignon, you know the one wrapped with bacon and with stir fried canned mushrooms dumped on it. It wasn't very pricy but it was on OK piece of steak. Now they have Filet Mignon at 30$ for 8oz but it is the best steak I've had in Montreal (and the rest of their steak selections are also equally amazing) always served standalone with roasted mushrooms and perfectly spiced, seared and cooked to your liking. An explosion of flavor in each bite. Because of Reuben's I no longer purchase steak for home, there isn't any point because there's no way it can be made this good. It can be served with fries, but I strongly suggest the Yukon Gold mash with garlic, it's got a KICK to it that is unmistakable. I've also tried the very simple deli classic, the baguette au jus simply because I wasn't in the mood for a huge filler of a steak and even something so simple was made to taste better by lightly searing the bread on the flat grill along with the steak and the jus was insane. So simple and easy and the BAM! Foodgasm.And yesterday, still not in the mood for steak, because as much as I love and worship the steak, one can overdoes on it, I decided I wanted the ultimate Reuben's classic sandwich which I had had in many other places before, The Reuben's. It's a smoked-meat sandwich with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and the ""special sauce"" (I hate that expression) slammed between pumpernickel bread and then grilled. I was only after the first half did I stop having spasms and stop moaning in delight. Such foody goodness shouldn't be permitted. Eating it was a messy affaire and required plenty of napkins but just like the perfect burger, if you don't make a mess, it's not the perfect burger. Sadly the cole-slaw fails.There are plenty of deserts to chose from at Reuben's and all are portions for two but when at Reuben's there is only one desert that matters. And trust me on this, they have the absolute best carrot cake you will eat in your short life. It is the orgasmatron of deserts, soft, chewy, moist, and sugary and an explosion of flavory goodness. It can't be beatThe service is normally very good, though I wouldn't say so after last night. But I'll hold that on single bad time as an isolated event. And as I was eating desert, I saw a plate of sliders go buy... they have sliders? I never got to the burger part of the menu yet. Damn! Next time.In the mean time, my favorite Deli gets a proper 5 outta 5."

We'd been here before, and have always been satisfied with the food/service. We were seated right away, and they accommodated our request for a booth. The only ""downer"" are the prices; they've been raised since I was there the last time, and for the type of restaurant I don't know if they're warranted. But hey, it's downtown Montreal, it's to be expected!Our waiter was by almost immediately to get our drink order. He was very nice and welcoming. He gave us a few more minutes to look at the menu and came back to get our food order. We started with the spinach and cheese dip, and I had the Bandara chicken sandwich with fries, while my boyfriend had the smoked meat with mashed potatoes. The food service was timely and convenient. Our spinach dip was delicious and hot; a nice blend of cheeses with some spinach. I'm a big fan of spinach dips, and this one ranks pretty highly in my books. We had enough time to somewhat digest the appetizer before our main dishes came out. Our plates came out, and I was excited to dig in. The Bandara chicken sandwich, in a word, was delish! The sweet BBQ sauce with the crispy onions and the sourdough bread; oh man! The portion was huge, so I was able to benefit from a second meal out of the other half of my meal. My boyfriend had the smoked meat, and says it was ok, but not the best he's had. When you've been to Schwartz's, it's hard to find somewhere that will top it! I had a taste and I'll admit it wasn't the best smoked meat I've ever had, but it wasn't terrible; it was edible and did the trick. So if you're looking for a decent lunch or diner spot, and are in the golden square mile, I would recommend Reuben's, and would definitely say get the Bandara Chicken Sandwich! Worth every bite!"

/user_details?userid=DW8SPSNRRCRtX3SVJ673JA,Amanda J.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I disliked the quality and service when I was there recently. My friend suggested that we go but the sandwiches we had were not very fresh. It is definitely not comparable to the smoked meat places on st. Laurent street instead.
/user_details?userid=bk-ejvwC8vce-mYVVEas1w,Shannon C.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,This is the first place I ate in Montreal and the best. My boyfriend and I shared the smoked meat poutine to start. He had the smoked meat sandwich afterwards and I had the turkey melt. The portions were huge and just great. Highly recommended.
/user_details?userid=kzXh1wIcCekofvPH5PGBgw,Gene K.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"Very disappointing...just ate here for lunch.....I'm a born Montrealer and have been eating Montreal smoked meat for over 50 years. Last time I ate here was 2 years ago and it was excellent...but today was just terrible.Smoked meat was very bland almost tasteless and very soft and mushy, almost slimy.The rye bread had no substance to it so you couldn't actually pick-up the sandwich , had to resort to a fork. Fries were cold,limp and no crispiness to them at all.Tuna sandwich .....well it wasn't worth the 12 bucks.Actually this pace is grossly overpriced for the quality of the food.Even Snowdon deli has better smoked meat...and that isn't saying much."

Liquor is served and their specialty is you guessed it ! Cole slaw! No just kidding. The slaw is not like American cole slaw, there's no mayo! It's made with vineagar. Yuck but it tasted very fresh, so fresh I could get past that tangy taste. The french fries are better then McDonalds, yummy. Portions are HUGE, plan on taking it home or share it with others to bed down the costs."

/user_details?userid=FJ2yu9Pf5LIYcncoRKyzFQ,Lu G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Mega portions, absolutely NO room for dessert. Love their Southern chicken crisp salad even if it takes me forever to finish it. Burgers are also monster- sized, usually slathered in various sauces and topped with cheese to boot!

/user_details?userid=5kg5JcERUZO0jbsKu4pPAQ,A O.,"Guelph, Canada",4 star rating,"Be aware!! Most reviews for the other restaurant, Reuben's Restaurent Delicatesseen, were meant for Reuben's Deli at 1116 Rue Saint-Catherine. I assume these two restaurants are owned by the same family where that on 888 Rue Saint-Catherine caters  more expensive food, with more traditional steak and barbecued meat.  Not that of less quality but if you fancy smoked meat with all derivatives then this is the right place. We ordered a small Poutine with cheese. This was a huge and a fulfilling meal. The Double smokers meat with rye bread and mustard was so large and tasty. I asked for Frank's  Red Hot and the friendly waiter brought me jalapeño (red) so I can enjoy the food. We ordered another barbecued sandwich which took longer to prepare but the waiter offered for us free refill of drinks. I would say the most distinctive feature of this place is the service. Well done. As for the furniture and decoration, it needs a refresher as the place despite  its jazzy entrance need a complete new carpet and sets of chairs.I liked the place and would definitely visit again."
/user_details?userid=lX4sSwlpNgV1y0uggWrF_Q,Christine D.,"CA, CA",4 star rating,The Famous Super Sandwich was amazing!  The brisket was so tender and delicious.  Good fries and I really enjoyed the light non mayonnaise type of Cole slaw.  Had I  known the chicken noodle soup was so great I would have ordered a bowl instead of a cup.  Top it all off with a nice cold Canadien draft and we had a very enjoyable lunch.
/user_details?userid=Tiwy05I8HxygcSgjchP00g,Tim A.,"Cedar Valley, Canada",3 star rating,"Rubens has been a favourite go to in Montreal for years. I've loved this place. Previous to my last visit, I've been wowed by the service, price and food - especially the smoked meat. After my last experience, I'm a bit disappointed. The service is still spectacular. Was not impressed with the 30% to 40% increase in the price for a smoked meat sandwich. What was 12 bucks with fries not too long ago is now $18 or $19. And apparently asking for no mustard means that they will add mustard, then try to half assed wipe it off. I did walk out with a 5lbs brisket to take home to Toronto as you just can't find this kind of meat back home. Sadly they charge well over $11 per pound to buy a la carte."

My sandwich was ok but the fries were hard. We were not pleased. not going back there even when their manager offered free dessert."
/user_details?userid=d1G6qV4v2RT2o8v27anr2w,John Paul T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been given a lot of shit from my foodie friends for going to Reuben's Deli all these years but I stand by my claim: Reuben's is just better than Schwartz's when it comes to smoked meat. Ok Ok. Point taken: you go to Schwartz's for the 'Montreal' experience but let me tell you honey, that place is so damn touristy now you couldn't find a real Montrealer in the crowd! They're all over at Reuben's getting a better sandwich in a MUCH better atmosphere. If you're reading this review because you're coming to Montreal as a tourist I would recommend you go to Schwartz's AND Reuben's. That's right. I said it. BOTH. it's hard to choose but for me personally I'm team Reuben's all the way. Their sandwiches are really quite different: they're much more moist (Schwartz's are dry, quite dry and FATTY) and Reuben's comes with a HUGE plate of fries (which I love). I also highly recommend you get the onion rings to start with the Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. They're unbelievably good. Like too good. I can only go to this place every 6 months because I leave so damn bloated! It's so filling! And don't be fooled by the huge menu they give you. There are like a million things to choose from but your eyes should go directly to the 'famous super sandwich' hidden at the top of one of the pages. They tempt you with other also-ran things like a 'chicken sandwich' or a 'hamburger'. UM. NO. Avoid. You should only get a smoked meat sandwich here folks. Really. This place is located on Ste-Catherine aka the retail/strip club street in the heart of downtown. Most of you American tourists are probably very familiar with this street already, lol, but despite its middle-Canada feeling amidst the corporate flagship stores, Reuben's is where it's at for a legitimate Montreal dining experience. Trust me.  LOVE IT."

/user_details?userid=ye1_2gsI6OxZZzZ33uvaGA,Kendra G.,"Regina, Canada",3 star rating,"The food was good and came in large portions, but is quite expensive for what you get. The sandwiches on their own are big, but the majority of your plate ends up being a pile of fries.  Although the restauarant was busy, it is quite large so there was no wait for a table. Our waiter was poor, only came by the table when necessary and did not offer refills or dessert. He seemed uninterested in his job altogether, which is probably quite common at spots with heavy tourist traffic. If you are in the area it is a decent option, but I would not recommend a special trip just for this restaurant."

The smoked meat was succulent and flavorful.  The platter comes with slices of bread, so you can build yoir own sandwich. Ask for more bread, as I am sure you will need a few more slices to finish the meat. The atmosphere us casual and the fact that the establishment had kid-friendly seating was a great bonus (vs.  Schwart's). The strawberry cheesecake is a must!"

I was extremely happy with the breakfast and didnt feel overly guilty eating so much in the morning as it was not too heavy.  My waitress for both days was excellent.   With a friendly demeanor, she showed herself to be comfortable speaking both french and english, which is nice for someone like me who does not always have the ability to speak french fluently.  Reubens will now be my regular breakfast stop while in Montreal.Was in Montreal early in June '16 and found out the owner, Gus, passed away in May, at the age of 82. His wit and personality will be sorrily missed. If you didnt meet him, you have definitely missed out one spectacular human... RIP Gus."
