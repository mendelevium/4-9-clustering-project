Service was amazing. You can tell the dishes are made with absolute care and top-quality ingredients.Steak de Macreuse Sous-Vide for 48 hours - A totally French and sophisticated version of the bland American steak and eggs. Croissant Wellington - Such a cute poached egg! Amazing combination."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super cute BYOB restaurant offering an ever changing seasonal menu of ""quebecois"" food with amazing service. I know that's a mouthful but it's all the things that make this restaurant so great! We made reservations for 3 on a Tuesday night and most times were free, I can imagine it gets busy on the weekends though. They have a decent range of appetizers however we skipped on these since we already had a quick bite. They include a small soup and bread and butter on the house each person anyway which was a nice surprise. For the main course they offer mostly local meats accompanied by a creative side dish. I had the duck leg confit while my friend had the beef tartar. Both were cooked so well, the duck was crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. It came with vegetables and a berry sauce that gave the dish a refreshing pop. Highly recommend, I wish it was always on the menu!Although it's on the expensive side, bringing your own wine and skipping on the appetizers could land you a great meal at $40 all in. I'll definitely be coming back here."
/user_details?userid=0QNRU_A6aruI-SrZdG0OrQ,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This was without a doubt, my favorite meal while in Montreal - 10/10 and outstanding in every sense. We were a brunch group of about 25 and we all loved it. The menu is sophisticated, somewhat simple, but nonetheless great. I had the grilled cheese with mamirolle cheese curd and red cabbage with a poached egg - so so good. Lots of people in our group raved about the beef short ribs steak, wellington croissant and the eggs benedict, but its hard to think you can go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Most of all the staff was super attentive and tended to every need of our very loud group. As if the service and food weren't enough, its BYOB! We purchased a few champagne bottles and mixed them with their freshly squeezed orange juice. You can also get their mimosa cider or a natural juice. I forgot what the juice of the day was but it was delicious. Zero complaints on this side. Next time I'm in Montreal I will certainly pay them another visit."
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my all time favourite BYOBs in Montreal. Came here at the last minute with some girl friends, and they were very accommodating in providing a last minute reservation (early on a Wednesday). As always, food was delicious and variety of high quality local ingredients were used. The pictures will speak for themselves.  A must try in Montreal. Menu changes with the seasons/availability of local ingredients. I would rate this place 100 out 10 if I could :D"
/user_details?userid=oGL9JE09OHEJMxpY4ma7tg,David P.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In my opinion, one of the best BYOB restaurant in Montreal. Reservation is necessary considering the location and popularity of this restaurant. The place is cozy and decorated with taste. Simple menues with great choices for vegetarians/vegans. The waiter was friendly and professional. Portion sizes are reasonable and plates are beautifully put. We were offered a complimentary soup as an appetizer. I ordered the Fresh local goat cheese appetizer and the Poisson du jour as the main dish.Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=IzvuBaQYl8vb-krpNJzAiA,Rose K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Flawless experience. I was seated right away, and my server didn't assume anything about my language skills- he asked if I'd prefer a French or English menu. Of course I wish I could read French! I tried my best. Everything on the menu is seasonal and fresh, so there were a few specials. I thought the Fish of the Day (cod) would be amazing since it came with morel mushrooms, but my server was careful to check for any dairy content. The sauce for the fish is a cream sauce, so I ended up getting the seared scallops as my appetizer, and the celery root with chanterelles as my main. I asked to add morels to the celery root dish and it was fantastic. I loved the crispy fried chickpeas that were sprinkled on top of the celery root dish. The umami of all the dishes was incredible. The big windows were a great way to watch the storm roll in, and enjoy the warm atmosphere inside. I would really like to come back for brunch!"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Flavours ! They nailed it.I've been wanting to come here for a while and finally my boyfriend took me here as he's a big fan of this spot I am not a huge fan as well.We had a great waitress who came over and explained the menu with a huge smile and knew all the ingredients and didn't miss a beat. She did a fantastic job and really made our dining experience great.So besides the fact that it's a byow it's a little loud but what would you expect? It was very classy and food was well priced for a byow because they usually hike the prices up but they didn't. We started with the scallops which were seared perfectly and the crumbled chicken skin was a nice touch. We then had the fiddle head salad which was served on a chic pea pure. It was my first time trying this dish and it's filling so I would suggest you share it like we did with all of appetizers. We then had the sweet potato which was really little so that kinda sucked but it was very good. It's served cold with a little cream on top with a a nicely cooked hot arancini. The best was the foie gras of course! It was served on a carrot cake with rhubarb with fleur de sel.The main we shared was the duck it was nice the what and sauce but the duck was over cooked. But since the service and experience was great I wont knock off any stars. The menu just changed for the season so keep your eyes peeled for a new menu in a few weeks.
/user_details?userid=91VOWuoq4hgq9n_e_ChkAw,Esmira J.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",5 star rating,"A good NYish brunch place was bit hard to find in Montreal but this place was cute. The place is a byob but it wasn't advertised, wish I knew because it was freezing out and didn't want leave again to come back. So we had brunch with there very very very minimally alcoholic mimosa. I ordered the steak and eggs, everything was well seasoned and cooked well. The mushrooms were a great add on as it helped me fill up. I was stuffed after the meal. My BF ordered the Croissant Wellington. Also a really good plate. Well seasoned, good portion and perfect for the day after a night of drinking. They also offered a complimentary yogurt with pears. It was absolutely delicious, I ate mine and my boyfriends. They should consider adding it to the menus."
/user_details?userid=zrOWilaYij83EZF_RW24qA,Angela J.,"Belleville, Canada",5 star rating,I went here with three other people for brunch and their menu was spectacular - very unusual delicious items. I had the beef Wellington croissant and still dream of it from time to time. Everybody at the table adored their dishes. I will definitely go back.
/user_details?userid=PDLmRSkVvi1DPhoP3I_vsw,Ashley J.,"Mauldin, SC",4 star rating,"We were accommodated even without a reservation, service is slow but it was completely full inside. Food took a long time to get and I think it is overpriced.  A cleansing yogurt palette came out prior to food and it was so good and light."
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,"Small and cute BYOB.Anything that advertise in front of their door that I should bring Champagne (which we did) has already won.The food was overall good. Some simple dishes and some a little more complex. I did really like the Tuna Tataki. It's available both as and entree and a main plate. However, as a main plate the slices are extremely ticker and it makes the plates less interesting and fine. I thing the entree option is better. The wild rice with the steak is also amazing! Sadly, there was just a couple of bites of it. Overall, it's good and quite affordable in the end. I'll have to try their brunch next."
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were a group of 6 and came here for dinner on Saturday night. Everyone was given a small cold potage to start with. It was refreshing and unlike any I've had before. I had the scallop and leek appetizer (under the tartare menu), and the sous-vide steak for the main. For dessert I got the favourite, maple creme brulee. So creamy and smooth! The plates were beautifully presented, and the food was perfectly cooked and savoury. Another restaurant that showcases Quebec produce to its best. It is also BYOW, and we easily finished off 3 bottles of wine :) Would love to come back here for their brunch menu!"
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I would give the food a 3.5* but since it is a bywo i give it sn overall of 4*.Although I remembered the food being a lot more tasty when I came here for a private wine tasting and the restaurant was serving small bites.All dishes come with a cold soup; taste was a bit blend. Took a scallop entrée and it was alright,  but didn't like the cucumber mousse that came with it. I don't like cucumber do didn't enjoy the mousse...but you might.Took the salmon as a main course and it was tasty. it was semi cooked which I like ane it had great flavor."
/user_details?userid=2vvcI5YP5sX0Qe-j-aXSTw,Nili H.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"Fantastic food in a relax environment thanks to our servers Sara, and Jean Simon. The main dishes duck and steak de short Ribs were excellent and for desert, apple bread pudding was great. They were out of Rabbit and we tried the Lamb shoulder replacing the rabbit. But we thought it could have been softer. We are definitely coming back next time we are in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",5 star rating,"Awesome brunch. More of a 4.5 for food, but the service was exceptional enough to round up. Lobster Benedict, awesome. Croissant Wellington, very good, but not sure if I'd order it again. Maple Brulee, totally amazing. A must try.Again, service was spectacular."

/user_details?userid=TOkAXPg-LYEaEFN6h7DBxg,Bianca R.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"They always have a wonderful seasonal menu that changes every few weeks. Every time we go, we want to try it all. The staff is extremely friendly too. BYOB is a huge bonus. Can't go wrong here!"
/user_details?userid=UVZtYCMHtXwy7f3HgLWeWQ,Lianne N.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"If you're opposed to delightful food, friendly service, and BYOB, don't go here. Everyone else, do it.My friends and I went here on our last night in Montréal and it was an awesome goodbye. I mean all the food we had in the city was great, but this was definitely a peak. We each had an entree, two of them special entrées--swordfish and veal--but I believe mine, the duck, was a dinner menu staple. All of them were delicious and worth the slightly more expensive price tag. (As an aside, compared to NYC prices, we felt so thrifty. Going back has been a rude awakening...I miss you Canada). We also had 2 desserts, a creamy and delicious creme brulee and this amazing shortcake with meringue and citrus fruit. Seriously, don't pass up on their desserts. Tl;dr version: you'll want to eat here."
/user_details?userid=veqfgg2AkKs_L70fx1Quag,Gary M.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,When you can bring your own wine is already a winner. We had a party of 5 and we probably choose almost every dish in the menu lol. The food is pretty good but not amazing. The service was very good also. The atmosphere was very candle light style. Great for a date to have dinner.

You can bring your own bubbly to make bottomless mimosas. :)The food is absolutely delicious. They often change up their menu to feature fresh ingredients. I had bavette and duck eggs for brunch, an interesting twist of steak and eggs. :)The decor is industrial and clean with high ceilings. Very nice place for celebration or special occasions!"
/user_details?userid=MGhUP0P2FqtnFNXha2su1Q,Sara L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Our favorite during our trip to Montreal. The service was great and the dishes were filling and tasty. We ordered duck and roast lamb. Both were very savory. The sauces were exciting too.
/user_details?userid=wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,Elle O.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The wellington croissant (brunch) is SO good! I wasn't allured by too many other things on the menu though, and it was super busy (ie: have to wait) so it's not a place I would go to unless I had a specific game plan (ie: craving that croissant)."
/user_details?userid=UPyyAYLeXdU3-t502I6DSA,Rasheed B.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is fabulous!  Every bit was absolutely delicious for me and my guest.  We had an amazing experience here and I look forward to visiting again when I'm in Montreal again.  Again every bite was savoury; the vegetable root soup that was on the house, blood sausage with fois gras, she had a fish dish and I had a bison ribs dish along with dessert.  Just the thought of it is making my mouth water!  Hats of to the chef!  Next time I'll be sure to bring a bottle of wine as they are a BYOB establishment; the first time I've seen such a place!"
/user_details?userid=zDL0fWXO84ex9Ip3Lv1CTQ,Y C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Yes another MTL restro getting my 5*. The slow cooked steak is to die for. I mean, for real, I rarely get excited, but the control of the texture and flavor is superb. The steak is still pinkish inside and has an almost eerie consistent texture without the taste of muscle fibers, something I will order again for sure."
/user_details?userid=CRuTcrkj24pmR9_mKQJWlg,Ray L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Creative, Delicious, UnpretentiousFor fans of the Montreal restaurant bring-your-own-bottle of wine experience, the three of us made this our first dinner reservation of a two night stay. This is my fourth time there and it never disappoints. Had the foie gras appetizer with lentils and chips presented on a small chopping board, followed by the veal which was juicy, marinated and a joy to eat, and the mushroom pie with duck confit, with a side order of frites with spicy mayo. - from a July 2016 experience"
/user_details?userid=g1faDWW6oPYtctjn8RgZqg,Sara-Fleur S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Very good restaurant. I especially liked the deserts. You can bring your own wine which is great! The food was a little more expensive than I expected, I paid $65 Canadian for 3 courses, which is not bad at all, but slightly more expensive than some equivalents in Montreal. If you like good food, it is definitely an address to keep in mind!"
/user_details?userid=8udmHPzKaNOtbgnrscUTFg,Jaz K.,"Mineola, Canada",5 star rating,"Called last minute - was browsing and google searching for good foie in the surrounding area. Note that it is a BYOB.This restaurant came up on a Montreal blog. Called and was greeted by a friendly staff member - they were happy to accommodate us.Arrived at 9pm to a packed house. Ambience is clean, simple, but appealing. Decor was fairly simple but effective (simple wooden tables, some hanging lights, and a few mirrors on the wall)As we have seen at Joe Beef and Liverpool house there is a chalkboard with the menu. Pleasant surprise when we were offered an English menu. Appetizers were of course a double helping of seared foie gras that we shared. Prepared with onion confit purée, pear, sunflower seeds and lentils. Delicious. Juicy. Yes please!We also had a lamb fried sweetbreads served with endive salad and pumpkin seeds and honey & aioli. Found this to be tasty but a little rich for my taste.The fish of the day was a haddock served with carrots, fiddleheads, Brussels sprouts and a grain the name of which eludes me at the moment. This was an absolute triumph. Great texture, and the fish was light, flaky, and flavourful. This combined well with the texture from the vegetables and accompaniments.10/10 would repeat. Also very reasonably priced with apps in the 13-19 dollar range and mains in the range of 25-35."
/user_details?userid=UBnysRSKOkSG8cCYYOYaAg,Ashley B.,"Venice, FL",4 star rating,"This was our first dinner in Montreal and we waited over an hour and half on the side walk, but the food made up for it! Service was so-so and we felt pressured to go down the street to buy a bottle of wine by our waitress because it's BYOB and we didn't get the memo, and they also kept pressuring us into ordering appetizers. So I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, for service. I had the mushroom pie, with a spinach and lentil salad. It tasted so much better then description and that I was thrilled about. I couldn't stop eating it and finished every last bite. I can't for the life of me remember what my husband had, some sort of beef, or pork..? Whatever it was I remember he raved about it and enjoyed his just as much as I enjoyed mine. Overall this place puts out some tasty dishes and is definitely a must try when in town!"
/user_details?userid=rPVirnxVTc8wP5Tw98I1oA,Diana C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Waited about 15 min with a reservation but it was so worth it. They were very patient and explained the dishes even though I knew no French. Bring your own wine but well worth it. Appetizer: salmon tartar: scrumptious!!  Crisp potato chips with chopped salmon, creamy sauce and pieces of green apple. Yum!!  Scallop ceviche: very fresh with no fishy smell. Hubby loved it but I didn't care for the foam which tasted like sweet cucumber.Entrees:  duck magree: so good!!  Medium rare with some fat and skin. Don't be fooled. You are out to enjoy yourself so dive in!  All the flavor is in the fat. I didn't really like celery purée but the asparagus kale and potato were very good. Deer Madellions: medium rare no gaminess very mild and tasted amazing.Dessert:  chocolate cake: more like a very creamy ganache bar. Yum but I couldnt do more than 3 bites. Creme brûlée: crunchy sugar outside with yummy custard inside that has just the right amount of sweetness and creamy dreamy... Yum.  I drooled a little just thinking about it. Hubby said one of the best he had. He also had an espresso to go with it. And this s after pastry hunting all day. Service: very patient, very attentive , and accommodating. One of the best.  Can't wait to come back"

My friend had the dougnuts with pork bacon or something and that was super good too. Overall, the service and the food are amazing. I wikl definitely go back."

/user_details?userid=hNihr6KJG0lNN7WbfxQYqw,Olivier C.,"Gatineau, Canada",5 star rating,"My wife picked that place before we went to a show and reading the menu, I wasn't really inspired. Well, I'm glad we went there! That was a culinary experience that is definitely worth the money we spent. I had the ""macreuse"" steak (not sure of its equivalent using the American cuts but it seems to be a part of the shoulder), a tough piece that would probably end up in a stew, but that they cooked sous-vide for 48 hours, with the whiskey sauce, and jerusalem artichoke (topinambours), a vegetable that never heard of before.The beef was extremely tender and unlike a filet mignon, it was extremely flavourful. The jerusalem artichoke was delicious, had a great texture and left me very satisfied. The sauce complemented those two for an exquisite meal. All this for $32, it's a steal.My wife also enjoyed her meal, the celeriac steak, which I had the chance to taste and it was very good.We were also given a beet soup as an entrée, which was included in the meal or free (not mentioned on the menu as far as I can tell), always nice to have a little extra! It was very good too!The only negative point for the night was that my wife booked and did not mention it was bring your own wine, so I didn't bring any and we didn't have time to walk to the SAQ to buy a bottle, so we had a dry night... But that was entirely our fault!If I return to the neighbourhood, we will definitely try to visit again. Make sure your reserve a table, the place was packed for the 5:30 and 6:30 PM time slots.Finally, service was friendly, relatively fast (and it was packed), nothing negative to say."
/user_details?userid=usjCgr2FGtgniufstpLQCA,Francis C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Food: Fois gras and sea snail (19) was delicious, the sandwich glace (10) and entre chaude (16) were rich; paired with some house-recommended wine. With this entre chaude, with bright blueberries and a thicker torched crust, it is so sweet and creamy, I recommend bringing a dessert wine especially for this. A rich red could also serve to balance such sweetness and give consistency to the meal.Service: Turns out its BYO... the environment makes this a must visit for a bevy of occasions. I'll be prepared with wine on my next visit. Total for two was $56 with tips included in the bill, so a good amount considering the quality and amount to eat -- You'll need it for exploring the area.Seated quickly.

The atmosphere is inviting, the staff friendly, and the food thoughtful and delicious. I enjoyed the venison which was cooked to perfection - just the right temperature and full of flavor.

I had the deer tartare and the duck main dish, both wonderfully flavored and very fresh.

It just exuded spring. Everything in harmony. The chef is an artist. We will be back for sure."
/user_details?userid=Q4nZArdLhLSptrL2WqoJjQ,Nancy W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"heard about this restaurant from the owner of the B&B we stayed at - make sure to call ahead for a reservation or else you might not get in. there is a SAQ wine shop right off the Beaudry metro stop you can stop at first to pick up a bottle of wine since it's BYOB, and it's only a few minutes walk from there. so glad we braved the cold and windy weather to get dinner here, the food is delicious. the menu is in both french and english, and the servers will also tel you the daily specials in both languages, when we went, the tartare of the day was duck (which we got), and the fish of the day was cod (which we also got). highly recommend the dishes we ordered - seared scallops, duck tartare, cod and risotto blend, deer with mushrooms and blueberry sauce, and don't forget the dessert! we shared the crime brûlée with maple liquor, omg so good. some notes - it was my first time trying deer and this dish did not disappoint. I ordered it medium rare and there was NO gameyness (sp?) at all - it just tasted like a very very very tender piece ofmeat. the sauce was very nicely seasoned and the mushrooms really balanced out the dish well. we also got free bread and butter for the table, as wel as their complimentary soup, which was squash and cardamom. I didn't love it but it was a nice gesture. also, they will ask if you want a palate cleanser in between the two meals, we didn't order it but did see the tables eat it. enjoy - we certainly did!"
/user_details?userid=kneX5ZeKlEVJ7qvg_EXBeg,Lizzy A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Chose to try out this place on a celebratory dinner date after reading rave reviews on Yelp, and so glad I did. I found the space to be surprisingly compact, but the atmosphere was bright and bustling. It was not the most intimate or romantic of dates, but we really enjoyed our time here, mainly because the food was so good.I had the scallops for starters, and they came in a delicious but heavy-ish sauce. Although I appreciated all the flavors of the dish, to me scallops should speak for themselves, and I thought these scallops were hidden a little too much by the big flavors of the rest of the dish. However, my date disagreed with me completely and unequivocally LOVED this dish, so what do I know?For mainsies I had the venison medallions. What made this dish so great was that the medallions were cooked to perfection -- As in, they literally could not have been more perfectly cooked. When I originally moved to Montréal, I was surprised to find I had difficulty getting a steak in a restaurant that was cooked just the way I liked it -- they all tended to come out overdone. (To be fair, I may have been going to all the wrong places, but it was such a frustrating experience that I actually stopped ordering steak all together.) The venison medallions at O'Thym, however, will stand out in my memory as one of the best-executed dishes that I have ever ordered, in Montréal or elsewhere."

It's tucked away at a parallel street from Ste. Catherine, and the menu appears to change everyday. The food simply put, blew my mind. Something drew me to the Tempura Blood Pudding, something I would traditionally never order, but no regrets whatsoever - it was one of the most delicious appetizers I've ever tasted. Perfectly mixed with vegetables and a complementing aioli, it was perfection embodied in an appetizer. The codfish was every bit as joyous, perfectly crispy skin and soft and buttery meat in a delectable olive oil sauce. Wish we had more space for dinner. It's byob so come prepared - for us it was a nice 'recovery period' from the afternoon spent drinking in the village!"

Their service have always been inviting, the atmosphere laid back, and does justice to the best produce (bad talents) Quebec has to offer. Never have I found any of the dishes bland or mundane. Without loosing the ""homely"" warmth of dishes, their flavours have always stood out in their own unique ""O'Thym"" way. Not all restaurants can establish their own palate, and do it so well, but O'Thym never ceases to surprise. Although I personally prefer their winter offerings compared to summer ones, the price to quality ratio is (in my opinion) the highest in Montreal, also BYOB!"

The food is all ""à la carte"" and the whole meal was delicious, from entrée to dessert. Plates came with a complementary gazpacho. The only reason this place loses a star for me was the service. We had a reservation and upon arrival, we quicky noticed how tiny this place is. We were greeted by a very stern waitress - no smile or word of welcome. Once we were seated, it took forever for her to come explain the menu, then to open our bottle of wine, and finally to take our order. Overall service was very slow. Due to all the fantastic reviews, I'm definitely willing to give this place another try. Already have a reservation to try the brunch out! To be continued..."

Having now eaten at Wellington, Smoking Vallee and this Gay Village gem by the same crew I'd be hard pressed to pick a favourite but will return to all three repeatedly. For ambiance this one holds my heart - there is some wizardy in managing to be both bright white and sexy soothing dim at the same time. Lighting designers were involved in this sleight of hand I imagine... The foooooood! Filet mignon came with a soup starter with a cauliflower base and some slow build kick to it of.. white pepper? I think? Lovely. Stop-and-talk-about-it lovely, which is saying something at table full of best best lady friends. The steak itself was perfect, melt in your watery mouth, and the tiny mushooms, puree of something, tiny perfect root veggies and brandy gravy.. good lord. That is all. The chocolate dessert and the erable creme brulle were outstanding.We had no problem getting a reservation the day before for the 6pm seating which was perfect for hitting a show at National well wined and dined after dinner.

The restaurant accommodated our large group (and many bottles of wine). We didn't encounter the loudness issue that other reviewers mention-- we could all hear each other fine and enjoyed the fun atmosphere in the restaurant. They offered us a delicious gazpacho soup to begin our meal. I ordered the braised bison, which I found to be incredibly tender, juicy, and delicious. My boyfriend went with the fish dishes, which were excellent as well. Basically judging from the many different plates in our large group, every dish was a winner. Some even ordered the palate cleanser sorbet to have in between the first and second course, and we all enjoyed passing it around and tasting it. All in all a lovely evening with delicious foods and a great atmosphere. Fantastic."

We started by sharing a main course mushroom tart that was excellent. My wife and I then each had the lemon vodka sorbet to clean our pallet ;) - must have. My wife had the lamb and I had the deer entree - excellent. We finished with a cappuccino, a double short espresso, and a special pumpkin dessert that had more ingredients and sides than you could shake a stick at!  Service = phenomenal.

/user_details?userid=k_5qnHKkcy9MLtY-Dmd2Sg,M J.,"Allenhurst, NJ",5 star rating,"This restaurant gets essentially everything right for me.  First it is byob - something popular where I am from in NJ but less so in Montreal.  I love the option of bringing my own bottle and I am sure that the clientele of this restaurant does as well because every table had brought a bottle.  I wish more restaurants in this wonderful city had the same policy.But on to the food!  We started with a cauliflower soup.  It was on the house and very much appreciated.  For an appetizer, I had the scallop ceviche and my friend had a roasted cauliflower dish to start.  Both were very good - complex, fresh and ample.  I appreciate that the restaurant had about 6 appetizers.  By not trying to do it all, they are able to focus on doing well what they do. This approach is their success with main courses of which there may have been 7 or 8.  I had the duck and my friend the salmon.  Again, delicious, complex, fresh and ample.  There were three desserts and we had two of them - the maple crème brûlée and the ice cream sandwich. These desserts were as delicious as they were simple.  If I could make just one suggestion in terms of the menu, I would include one appetizer salad.  Although I enjoyed a number of the options, others might prefer a little less animal protein.  On to the service!  The waiter was attentive, cheerful and helpful.  Another member of the staff opened up beer that we had brought.  It was clear that the wait staff was working together and team-oriented.  An upbeat, professional staff always sets a good tone for a good dining experience and this group enhanced the evening.Finally a word about the ambiance.  The restaurant is open and the ceiling is very high.  The lighting was calming and attractive.  The wood floors are a vintage touch yet the mirrors seemed more modern.  The only suggestion would be to rethink the music.  The same jazzy background music track played essentially all evening and became a bit tedious.  The restaurant should consider switching the music up a bit.I am giving the restaurant 5 stars and will certainly be back on my next trip.  I really enjoyed my evening there!"

I don't know how they do it! Everything is ridiculously flavourful, yet the flavours don't necessarily come from overwhelming sauces, but rather from the food itself. The quality here is top-notch, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable. It's also BYOB (I don't think they have a liquor licence), which makes the meal even more affordable compared to an equally spectacular dinner in Toronto (if that's even possible!).

We also had the salmon tartare (which, to our surprise, was actually *smoked*), the trous Normand and another off-menu item, the veal in chorizo sauce.

When we heard there were BYOB's in Montreal we were more than excited especially since we went a little crazy at the wine shop on our first day in the city. O'Thym was recommended by the lovely Risa D and we were not disappointed.The space is so clean and bright I was expecting it to be a little darker than it was. The restaurant isn't very big so definitely make reservations for a popular night. Service was great we never wanted/needed for anything during our 2.5 hour dining experience. Upon arrival our first bottle was popped and glasses filled to the brim with cava while we overlooked the chalkboard menu. Our server explained the day's specials the salad of the season, sea bass and veal rib. We were brought out a cold melon soup which unfortunately I couldn't eat since I am allergic but it looked very good.Entrées- I started with the Salad if the season that featured asparagus, ricotta cheese, roasted peppers and herbs drizzled with balsamic. The fresh and bright flavors went very well together and everything had been seasoned to my liking so I didn't need to add any addional salt. My dining companion thought it fitting to order foi gras since we were dining at a French restaurant. It came along side figs, and caramelized onions. I being the worst vegetarian in the world tried foi gras for the first time; it was interesting that's all I'm going to say. KP seemed to enjoy it very much. This is only one of the few places that charges for a palate cleanser but it had vodka in it and was so good I forgave that $7.00 fee.Plats-I chose one of the specials sea bass it was amazingly good. Two perfectly seared pieces of sea bass atop quinoa and bean salad. There was a purée on the plate could tell you what it was but it was delish. I cleaned my plate (something I rarely do).Dessert ended our meal and the crème brulee was absolutely delicious. This was one of the better meals I've had in recent memory. I would highly recommend coming here it's worth every penny and you actually won't spend that much. It's priced just right in my opinion for the level of service and food preparation."

We ordered the shrimp ravioli appetizer.  This was a really exotic play on the ravioli as it mixed many herbs with shrimp to give a very earthy and herbally taste.  This is the type of dish that a wine pairer dreams of.We also ordered the smoked salmon dish and it was to die for.  This was a very traditional french dish loaded with herbs and captured the perfect nodes for a Bordeaux.  This was by far the best dish we ordered.The other entree we ordered was the risotto white fish special, which does not appear to be a regular menu item.  This dish was good but a little heavy for my liking.  The risotto was fantastic but the fish was a little to subtle of a taste to be paired with the a rich rosotto. However, we really liked the fresh beans that were mixed into the risotto.  This created a very nice texture to add alongside the risotto.The service is excellent and the wait staff is very nice.  I will definitely go back on a future visit to Montreal.It is also reasonably priced for the food and ambiance."

I would seriously go to this place and just get two and then hide under my napkin while I eat them.  We had four 'Trou Normands"" after our apps, and I thought they tasted great. It was a lemon sorbet sitting in a pool of vodka (so technically not a Normand according to my friend, since that requires Calvados and apple sorbet) but it was good nonetheless.For the mains, two of us ordered the Lamb and two the Deer Shoulder.  I loved the deer shoulder, which was the perfect medium-rare I'd asked for, and was served with a really delicious sauce (kind of tasted like balsamic reduction but don't quote me) and root veggies.  There wasn't anything left.  I wasn't a fan of the lamb, but I don't seek it out typically and the two lamb eaters were happy.Overall, I'd say this is my best overall restaurant experience in Montreal. I highly recommend checking it out."

Delicious.I called and made a reservation for two 45 minutes prior to our arrival to allow for enough time to stop by the SAQ and pick up some wine - BYOW, what a great way to dine! Buying wine at the liquor store we were able to drink VERY well - Chateau Margaux and Chateauneuff du Pape!! Must have saved over $100 compared to buying those wines in a restaurant.On our way to the restaurant, my sister called and asked to join us, and O Thym accommodated no problem: we had to wait 15 minutes for a table for three to open up, but our waiter was happy to seat us and open one of our bottles while we waited for my sister to arrive and switch to the other table. Being Ville Marie (or The Village, depending on who you talk to) it is nearly all Francophone. The menu was chalked up on a board entirely in French, a lovely characteristic, but our waiter was happy to bring us an English menu - not even of a flutter of snobbery. Throughout the meal he made a much-appreciated effort to speak to us in English, and did a bang-up job at it, topping off our fabulous experience.Now, to the food! Oh the food - scrumptious. I started with the sweetbreads while my fellow diners had the smoked duck salad and the salmon & avocado tartare. Forkfuls exchanged around the table, all quite tasty. We followed that with a palate cleanser of sorbet, and then I had the venison and the rest of the table the filet mignon. Once again, all delectable. For dessert we shared a cheese plate, the creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate cake. No let down here either! The meal was paced perfectly, and we were the last ones in the place.Coming away from a meal like that without having broken the bank was just so refreshing. The BYOW along with mouth-watering food and top-notch service all in an unpretentious setting: this is bistro dining at its best!"

Obviously a relatively new server who needed a lesson in slowing down. I started with the salmon tartare which turned out to be atrocious! It was ceviche NOT tartare and was void of any taste except for the lemon juice it was bathed in. Big time fail. For my main I had the rack of lamb which was far better than the tartare but still lacking in the flavour department. I ordered it medium and it came out blue. I'm not sure what all the hype is about but this is one resto I would recommend to avoid. With so many other delicious options in the area, there's no way I'd return."
/user_details?userid=j45PvQmPfz6Cn5HNVEa5DA,Lainna L.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"This is not a tiny place, it seats 30 people easily. It is open and airy, the restrooms and kitchen are in the basement, further contributing to a sense of openness and space. There is a one page menu featuring the standard French fare. There was an effort to use unique ingredients such as fiddleheads (in the middle of May?) and sea urchin, as well as cheese and beef from PEI. Bring your own bottles of wine.Food: The food is above average. I ordered the octopus appetizer. It was grilled perfectly and presented beautifully on the plate. The entre I ordered was bison ribs. I had to send it back to the kitchen. The brick-heavy lump I was presented with was a tough hunk of meat. Like chewing a baseball. I complained that it was overcooked but the waitress corrected me to say it was actually not cooked long enough. Either way, it was inedible so they graciously replaced it with the duck which was perfect. For dessert I tried both the chocolate torte and creme brule. The chocolate was not too sweet and I would recommend this dish.Service: Our waitress frequently rolled her eyes at customers within our view when other tables asked questions about the menu, or made requests. My dinner companion reminded her of a forgotten order which resulted in more eye rolling. I felt this disdain of customer requests and questions was not acceptable or appropriate.Pricing: Generally a good value. The menu items are priced well at approx $15 for appetizers, $29 for entres. I tipped 15% but as we were leaving, the waitress pulled me aside from my group and implored me to give her a higher tip. I interpreted this to mean she wanted me to include the undercooked entre returned to the kitchen. Being flustered and non confrontational, I paid for both entres.Ambiance: One of the best things about this restaurant is the openness of the space. It is clean, modern, and simple with plenty of natural light."

/user_details?userid=1M-3H0aVJdU0P3QZ8LIPqQ,Scott T.,"Westmount, Canada",1 star rating,"Explanation: 1 star = overall experience ruined.We were a group of 6. The perfect review opportunity.Unfortunately, one main course was not edible, so it was sent back.Not a big deal, it happens all the time...BUT... O'Thym doesn't have a Manager on the floor, so the issue was handled very clumsily.First, a free replacement was offered... then they wanted to fully charge... and finally, no charge was the best they could do- back and forth they went... and meanwhile, I have guests to entertain. During all of this, the original plate was re-presented cold and was disected to try to convince us it was ok... another poor mistake.One of our guests had eaten there before. She came for her bachelorette (8 people) and explained to us that her whole group was kicked out, so that O'Thym could turnover the table. Not a nice memory... so, this was the 2nd service gaffe in two visits for her.Here's the problem: If you have an issue, the only person to help you is a glorified waiter who has no authority to take care of the matter at hand- sadly, that's the best scenario. The Owner/Chef, stays in the kitchen, as he works hard to produce plates- so don't expect him to come out to help you- he will simply use his waiters as messengers.The result is that ""we"", as customers, suffer.O'Thym has proven to be too risky to bring groups when you consider you're paying top dollar for a BYOW that can be hit or miss on customer service.When there is so many things that could go wrong, especially with groups, this is not a risk I am willing to take again.In these cases, it doesn't matter how good the food is, when a bad experience can quickly smack the good flavour out of your mouth and eliminate your appetite.Main thing: don't expect the service standards of a top downtown restaurant when you dine here and avoid for special occasions."

I tried to walk in and get a table Saturday evening but it was booked up so set a reservation for Monday night. As with many places in the area of Montreal where I was staying it was BYOB but not too hard to find a Couche-Tard close by to get a few bottles of wine.The place has a great atmosphere and the night I went it was  raining and my group was by the window. Being from Arizona I am absolutely fascinated by seeing rain so for me, a great spot, but it is a long restaurant and I am sure if asked one could get a table toward the back.All the food my group of four ordered was delicious. One person ordered the salad with sautéed  duck gizzards and they were melt in your mouth tender. I had to try the foi gras (might have spelled that wrong which on this night was served room temperature and mixed with a bit of honey that gave it a slightly sweet texture (the other option is the more usual sautéed version).  I was on a duck roll that evening and also had the grilled duck breast that was served (correctly) quite rare and sliced thin and then fanned out. Two other people at the  table had the salmon and thought it was well done.I liked this place enough that when I go back to Montreal I plan on a return visit. It has that classic bistro feel that makes you feel that you could just as well be in Paris as Montreal (viva la France!). I promise you, if you go, you will not be disappointed! :-)"
/user_details?userid=rjKQk8c1MdFbXLN_4Vt4CQ,Mark M.,"Somerville, MA",5 star rating,"Last summer I took a spontaneous roadtrip to Montreal. No plans. Just got in the car and drove 6 hours due north from NYC. Arrived. Checked into a hotel. Then it hit me...in being so spontaneous I now found myself sitting in my second favorite city in North America sans dinner reservations, and my two staples of Montreal trips, Au Pied de Cochon and Joe Beef were, naturally, booked solid. Suddenly my spontaneity seemed to be my downfall.It's difficult to have a bad meal in Montreal. There's a lot of great food there. That being said, there are also a lot of tourist traps. The last thing I wanted was to blindly head to just any restaurant, spend a lot of money, and get ripped off. I spent an hour or so wandering around, and nothing felt right. Then, I happened to be walking by O'Thym just as they were opening for the evening, and though they were booked for their first seating, they had a cancellation and were able to squeeze me into one of the tables towards the back. I wasn't sure how to parse the white walls and Thierry Guetta prints...I liked the minimalism, but it felt ""cold"". I started wondering if I had a made a mistake...if this was going to be one of those uber-pretentious places that serve you thimble-sized portions with an ingredient list longer than most Samuel Beckett plays.However, all of my worry disappeared as soon as I had the first taste of the complimentary chilled cucumber soup. It was incredibly refreshing (it was really hot outside), and left me wanting more. The best sweetbreads I have ever eaten were at Bayona in New Orleans. The sweetbreads at O'Thym were a very close second. Up next was a palette-cleansing sorbet, followed by my main course, a Venison loin. I love venison. My father used to hunt deer, and I spent a good chunk of my childhood and adolescence with deer meat in our freezer. It was a staple food growing up. Unfortunately, most people don't know how to cook it. I am not exaggerating when I state that this was the best venison, by leaps and bounds, that I have ever eaten. Not the least bit gamey, as tender as most filet mignons, incredibly flavorful, perfectly cooked. Even though I have eaten venison hundreds of times, I honestly did not know that venison could be like that."

/user_details?userid=YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,Ari S.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal is over-saturated with French bistros. Seemingly hidden on every side street and kitty-corner, they should be approached with caution. I generally pause to parse over the menus and maybe glance at the laminated reviews in the window as I walk by them. No more than that. Most are pricey and I'd say they aren't worth it but I haven't eaten at enough of them to make that judgment. But on my modest income, limited budget (if I ever bothered to sort one out) and meager debt-ridden existence, if I'm going to go out and spend 50 hard-earned dollars on a meal, it better be worth it.  There's nothing worse than a disappointing and expensive meal. Okay, there's a lot worse than a disappointing over-priced meal (like cancer) but you know what I mean.  This brings me O Thym, a bistro that stands out amid this cluttered market. First things off the bat - it's BYOW. This already makes the price of a meal that much more reasonable since wine can tack on at least a dollar sign or two to any meal (and who wants to eat at a French bistro without a bottle of wine? It's like eating corn on the cob without butter. And it's even better when you can bring two or three bottles and feel extra extravagant without paying forty bucks a bottle). But, yeah, there are other French bistros that are BYO (specifically on the Plateau which has about six of them that I can name off the top of my head) so this plus has to be backed up by the food. And this unassuming bistro off of de Maisonneuve in the Village is the best BYO bistro I've been to (better than Au Petit Plateau, Colombe and a few others I forget) . The decor is minimalist and tasteful (it actually doesn't look like much from the outside - could be a fancy sandwich joint) with a daily menu chalked on a large blackboard. Prices are fairly reasonable considering it's French and BYO (something like 22 to 35 for main courses). I had the best ostrich I've ever had in my life there.  Sure, that may not say too much since I've only had ostrich a handful of times in my life but this one was cooked to absolute perfection. Great food, good unpretentious service and the bill only worked out to forty per person with an appetizer and main course (including tax and tip)."

The scallop ceviche appetizer was lovely, summery, light and balanced.  My daughter loved her salmon fumee with couscous and seaweed butter. I thought my husband's fish special with lobster bisque, sweet peas & wheat berries was the best dish of the evening. While my duck with celeriac, beets & lemon-thyme sauce was nice, it was similar to many dishes I've had elsewhere. As I said earlier, the entire evening was marred for me by the long wait.

Love the water menu.  Loved the modern/simple decor.  Emphasis here is on delicious food and good service.For starters I had the salmon tartare with pureed avocadoes.  Fresh and superb products.  Husband had rocket salad with smoked duck and parmesan.  Wonderful touch of balsamic reduction--killer good combination of flavors.We then moved on with our meal: my main course was the lamb chops with roasted garlic.  Cooked rare, just as I requested.  He had the filet mignon (bleu--and it was) which was served with wild mushrooms.  How spectacular were these meals I cannot even tell you.  Perfection.  Dessert--we shared a wonderful creme brulee.  Heaven.  At the end of our meal we told our server that our meals were exceptional and he remarked that he is the owner of this place and 3 other similar ones, and gave us the business cards.On our next trip to Montreal I hope we have the chance to try them all.  Fantastique, eh!"

I would recommend the second service as there is little pressure at that time to leave the table.  That being said, the service is not very fast, however the staff is very nice and knowledgeable.For your BYOB needs consider paying about $10 more for your main to have great food.Will return.One sad note is their website needs a makeover.  Just a detail."

O'Thym was recommended by several people. We arrived about 45 minutes early and thought we might be able to be seated early. Little did we know ""2 seatings per night"" means one starts at 6 and one starts at 9. We had to come back. Which was fine because we had the chance to explore the ""bohemian"" neighborhood where O'Thym is located. Just before nine, most of the earlier customers had left and groups of people started pouring in for the second seating. The waitresses methodically opened bottles while describing the menu items. The small staff of 3 worked the room with precision and pleasantries. The food was new French with many of seasonal and local ingredients, but prepared with a freshness leaving some of the richness of traditional French food behind. I had zuchinni flowers stuffed with mushrooms served over a bed of sweet peppers drizzled with a red pepper sauce. My main course was bison steak and served with too many supporting dishes and flavors for my liking. (a small portion of potatos gratin was so cheesy that the cheese took over the flavor of anything else with it).My husband had ceviche for his entree followed by a filet mignon which he found to be cooked perfectly, but a bit rich for his taste. His meal was served with the same host of side dishes. There was a nice surprise - a palate cleansing course of melon sorbet served in a martini glass splashed with vodka. MMM!The place had a good energy. We would go again!"

All aspects (service, food, atmosphere) of this restaurant should receive 5 stars (save wine service since this is a BYOB). The servers were so friendly and informative.  They were also very passionate about the food being served; knowing it and describing it perfectly. A friendly welcome often sets the tone for the whole experience and these folks win here. The atmosphere is energetic bistro with enough sound dampening to allow for a pleasant personal conversation. The food was to die for: exploding with the primary flavor of the dish yet complimented by herbs and spices. I had the sweetbreads as an appetizer. These were served with a light, slightly sweet sauce of fruit and maple and topped with coarsely prepared herbs that was so light yet exploded with flavored and textures. We also had a brilliant Halibut with black garlic and mango that was perfect for a warm summer night and delicately prepared. We trusted the chef so much we had creme brûlée and a trio of sorbets for dessert - things we would NEVER order in lesser hands -and they did not disappoint. The creme brûlée was rich and delicious and the brittle crust perfectly executed. My sorbets were anything but the usual; they expressed their flavored to a T: pear, fennel and blueberry. In addition there was an amuse bouche of gazpacho and an interlude of lime sherbet in vodka all part of a perfectly paced (2+ hour) meal. Add the fact that you can bring and have a wine you couldn't afford from most restaurant wine lists and you have an exceptional night out. This place is a must."
/user_details?userid=5aPc2aSSC_biklgOPu2udQ,John T.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing. Unpretentious, delicious local ingredients cooked in classic French style. The food is top notch, but bringing your own wine allows for a fabulous dinner at a much reduced price (no restaurant markup on the bottle, which is a big difference). Ambiance and service are pitch-perfect. Is it loud at times? Is it crowded at times? Maybe, but if that's what it takes to allow more people to experience this gem, so be it. I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=LPOUJ-4EYvlJ-Qe8l-xAGw,G R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good service, mediocre food but incredibly loud (dinner service) and tables jammed next to each other.  The bring your own wine component definitely attracts a different clientele than what you would usually find at a French resto.  Ris de veau ( sweetbreads) appetizer good but not terribly memorable, Trou Normand palate cleanser fresh and clean, rabbit kidney entree fairly good.  My experience was definitely tainted by the decibel level.  The lunch crowd seems more refined."
/user_details?userid=hpbeCc5_rwk_Dylu940mpQ,Paul L.,"MA, MA",5 star rating,"For the last night of our honeymoon, we were looking for something special. We found it and more at O'Thym. We were staying nearby, popped in to make a reservation, and were told that dinner seatings were at 6 and 9. We chose 6, and were greeted by a gentleman who was kind enough to warn us off of the table near the door,""because of the smokers"" and seated us near the window. Our waitress Vanessa was cheerful and helpful in a genuine way, not with a forced smile for the American tourists.She was very busy but attentive, an excellent waitress. We brought our own bottle of French red that we had purchased earlier, I only wish we had brought a better wine to complement the delicious food. We started with an entree, my wife had a veal liver dish with pistachio and star anise, I had foie gras in a pastry with fig sauce. The flavors were intense. The Trou de Normand, or palate cleanser, was a lemon sorbet in  citrus vodka served in a martini glass with rind and a sprig of mint. It was the ideal setting for the next course. My wife's lamb chop plat was superb, and my filet mignon was the finest piece of beef I've ever had. For dessert we both had a concoction of spiced pears, Cointreau, tamarind, and cream that was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Any anniversary visit to Montreal will certainly include a return to this place, it was a consummate ending to our week of celebration."
