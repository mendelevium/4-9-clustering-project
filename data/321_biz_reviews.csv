/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here with a party of 4 for dinner on a Friday evening. I made the reso in advance as I knew they'd get  busy (which they did)! I've heard many great things about Beatrice so I was looking forward to finally trying it for myself. The staff were warm and friendly from the minute we walked in until we left and we started the night off with some cocktails and Prosecco. The ambiance was really lovely too. I loved the modern decor with the twinkle lights to add magic and warmth.For appetizers, my partner and I shared the spicy tuna tartare which they graciously split into two plates prior to serving us our friends shared a dozen of lucky lime oysters from PEI. The portion of the tartare was not too impressive but it was a polished and sophisticated dish and they brought some taro chips for us to enjoy it with. For my main, I had the Branzino Mediterranean Sea bass with roasted artichokes, fennel and salsa verde. This was probably my favourite part of the meal! The fish was cooked perfectly and it went well with the bottle of Sancerre we had ordered. My partner got the braised veal cheeks tortellini served in wild mushroom soup and that was extremely tasty and rich as well! Everyone was pretty full but my partner ordered the chocolate hazelnut budino which was a warm chocolate cake that was filled with Nutella served with a fresh strawberry and vanilla ice cream. I tasted it and I thought was good but nothing to write home about. They did dim the lighting quite drastically part way through the meal and it did get considerably louder which makes sense as it was a Friday night (I would suggest to be seated in the dining room if you want more quite and the ""patio"" with the twinkling lights and the bar seemed more lively). Also, the server was extremely nice and accommodating but didn't seem as knowledgeable when it came to helping us with picking the right bottle for the night - which turned out to be okay because we already had a good idea of what we wanted. Overall, it was a great dining experience in great company. The portions are not huge but I thought it was appropriate. The food was great, very fresh ingredients and the service was impeccable. I'd like to return here in the near future to try a pasta dish! Tip: they also have valet for $10!"

In my opinion I didn't think it was biig enough to host over 200 people but it definitely proved me wrong.Service: 5/5+ very nice and friendly staff they were hard to grasp as everyone was  asking for something.. maybe more waiters is necessary at this event.Cocktail hour was fun and they offered open bar which is always appreciated at any wedding.A lot of amuse bouche to try in the lobby yummy. The food: the couple sent us a menu with food restrictions etc, and we chose what we wanted to eat prior to the event..pretty Sweet! It's hard to nail that part perfectly but to my surprise again the staff new what we were having. Tables were wonderful and fancy. Beautiful center pieces with lots and lots of flowers.The restaurant definitely outdid themselves We were able to chosee our main dishI chose the Sea Bass and my husband chose the filet minion. My sea bass was a bit dry unfortunately and his filet miniô was oK too a bit well done. Our antipasti Gnocchi was delicious The food itself was good but a bit overcooked and I find the portions were not enough was super hungry after the eventt ! The lava cake was delicious and the chocolate running out of the cakee oozing out and running all on my dessert plate so yummy Overall, nice little iitalian resto and pretty cute to have a wedding reception. Will be back here on a regular nigh to truly enjoy more of their food menu"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food and good service. The grilled octopus and tuna tartare were great. They were full of flavor, fresh and the octopus was very tender. The sea bass' skin was perfectly grilled, it was nice and crispy. The taglioni was just ok. The pasta was chewy, but the sauce was very ordinary. The decor inside is beautiful and I can definitely see why people come here for their wedding. The service was great and the food came quickly. Although the food was good, it's a very pricey. For 2 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 main entrees, it was 215$ with the tax and tips. For that price, I didn't leave the restaurant amazed by the food."

This restaurant is downtown and parking is very scarce but they have valet available for 10$. This was a party so they had cocktail time before had, we had access to an open bar where the bartender made anything you wanted and all the drinks I ordered were very good. During this cocktail time they also served many hors d'œuvres. From mini beef taco to carb cakes and salmon rolls, it was pretty awesome.Time for dinner service we had a choice of salmon or lamb chops. The course was started by salad then we had gnocchi with rosée sauce and then the main dish, I had the salmon which was excellent, but I also tried the lamb and found it was very tough and did not enjoy the sauce. Many had the same complaint. Overall its a nice restaurant with fantastic food. I am sure that it is also quite pricey."

We ordered well-suggested bottles of white and red wine, I had the 3 course lunch menu ($25) which came with Grilled octopus, the catch of the day and the dessert, everything was excellent from the wine pairing to the food and service.  I recommend this place and will definitely be back to try their dinner menu."

I got the lobster risotto (amazing- little salty but amazing) and my friend got the seafood linguine which she said was good.

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The other night I sampled the burrata appetizer and the 20oz. rib steak. The cheese is served on what tastes like a little piece of fried bread along with some cured meat. It made for a very nice appetizer, though I would have liked a touch more included in the portion. I also sampled a few bites of my wife's excellent tuna tartare appetizer which had a subtle taste of wasabi. My wife had their shrimp dish which I have ordered here on previous occasions. It is delicious, but not exactly an overflowing portion if you are really hungry. Throw in an extra shrimp or two and some pasta instead of a cute little bed of whatever it's served on, and I feel the dish would be elevated both in terms of value and visual impact.As had been my experience previously, the 20oz steak is massive and takes a while to carve up and eat. I think I was only about a quarter of the way through my meal by the time everyone else at the table had already finished their dinner! I'm now firmly decided that this is one of the best steaks in this city, which is no small feat for a restaurant that is not a steakhouse by any stretch of the imagination. The marbling, tenderness, and perfect medium rare cook on this bad boy is as good as anything you will get at a premium steakhouse. The fries are just ok. Clearly, they don't specialize in fries. A substitution of fries for some garlicky capellini or some penne vodka would launch this dish into the stratosphere.....just my humble suggestion.Service was quite good, and the dessert and fruit platters were spot on and plentiful. As always, the place is packed and the mood is festive!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for a retirement dinner for a work colleague.  We were around 30 people and had a private room upstairs.  Decor was fairly basic but clean and elegant.  Service was very good, was impressed that they managed to serve such a large group efficiently without making some people wait.  Started with a nice salmon tartare, it was billed as ""spicy"" but while very fresh I found it lacked any sort of kick. Then there was a really excellent homemade veal stuffed agnolotti that was my favourite course.  The main was sea bass, quite good but ever so slightly over cooked. Dessert was a very tasty hazelnut budino.  The meal was priced at $90 which I thought was reasonable given the quality of the food.  Overall a very solid meal and enjoyable evening.  Good choice for dining with a large group if budget is not an issue."
/user_details?userid=BWKDeehIFkXoLsSuRWpqdQ,Rinad S.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very nice vibe even during covid, sanitation of the place is well executed. Went for a friends birthday and the waiters were patient with us when we were waiting for the whole group to come. Food came fairly quickly and was really good. Wished the menu would be a little less meat focused but it's a minor issue. I had the salmon platter and a Shirley temple. Salmon was so soft and cooked very well. The tahini sauce under was amazing! A little pricy and wished there was more to the plate than just the salmon (salad maybe next to it or sautéed veggies for example) but when it comes to quality, they truly have it."

/user_details?userid=xz5-2fSiTyAzLybdB9tU7w,Nic Q.,"North Hatley, Canada",3 star rating,We have been wanting to try this out for a while as it looks gorgeous. Reservation online via their site kept saying we needed to call.We took chance and showed up in person and was given a table not in the terrace. If you do go you want to be in the terrace as its where the action is and looks much better.We enjoyed our dishes but expected a higher level of service if your paying top dollars. We were asked if we wanted pepper on our dishes only when we were on last bites and found the wait staff young and too playful and not enough professional experience.
/user_details?userid=C0tlFXBGA2BbhUfaoWg-IQ,R Jean P.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Had lunch here with family, and it was quite enjoyable. Though a little upscale, the atmosphere was perfect for an afternoon lunch date. Firstly, you will be needing a reservation because it can get a little busy here. But once you're in, the ambiance does not disappoint. They have two floors and spacious, perfect for hosting big groups and events. The staff are quite friendly, readily available, and are very accommodating. So if your French is a little rusty you need not to worry. Food wise, we ate from the set lunch menu with a variety of options, including vegetarian friendly dishes. Appetizers I'd recommend are the Beet Carpaccio, which was quite refreshing, and the Salmon Focaccia. The Beef Tartar left a spicy after taste, if you enjoy a little kick. For the main course we ordered the Veal Scaloppini, which was a little bland for my taste and could use a tad more sauce. But otherwise it was the Chef's recommendation. The other recommendation was the Fish of the day. It came as a Sea Bass, which was very tasty, but could use without the sauce. The Carbonara and Risotto were by far my personal favourites; creamy and delicious! For dessert we were present with a Dessert platter, compliments of our family friend who works as their amazing pastry chef! We had brownies, cheesecake, ice cream cakes, chocolate ganache, cookies and an assortment of fruit. Many other customers couldn't take their eyes off the platter! It was extremely delicious! Overall, this is a great Italian restaurant if ever you are in their heart of Montreal and are looking for great tasting dishes that won't disappoint!"

There are a very few restaurants that leave that amazing impression, that your eyes sparkle every time you think or talk about it. This restaurant is that place to me. I am in love with every single dish my husband and I ordered here. The service was great! I wanted to order many things but because of my husband, I had to cut down on quite a few things. So we ended up ordering burrata (LOVE), tuna tartare, pappardelle, eggplant ravioli and tiramisu. I loved everything we ordered, so much that I was actually in food coma. The place itself is really amazing, the ambience especially. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice date spot!"

From the decor to the service everything was spot on. The food was exquisite. We had an international buffet and it included lobster rolls, duck, porc chops, which were all excellent. At the table we had a wonderful Burrata as an entree. The salmon tartar was a bit too fishy for my liking. As the pasta dish we had the most exquisite tasting pasta dish with truffle oil and wild mushrooms. I had two because it was so darn good. For the main meal I had the grilled veal chop which was outstanding!! So tender and delicious. I tried my friends sea bass and unfortunately it was also a bit too fishy for me. I was so stuffed I couldn't have the desert but later on in the evening I got to try the midnight table. There was sweet and salty and I had the mini burger sliders. And I tried their fruit platter which was good. I would definitely come back on a regular day to try other items on the menu.That rétractable roof tho!! Wow"

The food here is simply exquisite. Some dishes are traditionally Italian while others are more inventive and made with nothing oher than the highest quality of ingredients. The attention to detail when it comes to quality is astonishing. Everything in your plate is sure to be wonderful, even the garnish!Since I have eaten here quite a few times, I have tried most of the menu, but my standouts so far are the tartares (tuna and salmon), the kale salad with dates and hazelnuts and the amazing parmesan eggplant ravioli. My husband swears that they serve the best octopus in the city. All the meat and fish dishes I have had were always solid as well.The prices are on the high side, but given the quality, they are not exaggerated at all. The service is also excellent and friendly.  They have a coat check and a valet. The valet costs 15$, but worth it since you don't want to be stuck looking for parking downtown. Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=QD_1-aL7zTQv5-0n8QeXPg,T N.,"Anjou, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant forever but they only open from 6pm and with 2 small toddlers it's a bit late. But I decided for my 30th I was gonna make it happen and had babysitters to enjoy this night out! We booked it for July 11 on a Saturday for a group of 6 (Asians). I was first to arrive and I greeted the hostess saying I had my reservations at 8, in which she replied that it's actually at 8:30 and my table wasn't ready but I told her that I had called couple days ago to change it to 8 and it was confirmed. She rolled her eyes, looked annoyed and told me to follow her to the table. I thanked her once seated and she just walks away. Although a rocky start I was still very excited for the night. Eventually the rest of the group came and we were ready to order. As soon as our waiter (Claude) arrived we can sense his negative energy like he was there to serve us but he would rather not. Extremely cold and unwelcoming. We wanted to order white wine and asked for his recommendations, we like Chablis but there was only one on the whole menu priced at $275. We told him something similar but at a reasonable price, he looked irritated like why are you here if you can't afford it. The whole night never once did he come checked on the table and ask if things are ok or poured our wine. We then order a round of Vsop each and reorder a 2nd when it was done but it came it was only about half poured compared to the first time. We told him about it and said we would like the same thing as before even if it meant paying more. He replied with ""Well did you drink from it?"" Indicating that we are trying to rip them off. We all came from the service industry (waitress/bar/hairdresser) so we are always very polite to the staffs because we know it's not easy but we also know that their attitudes towards client will only be like that because they simply don't like them. As if our presence annoyed them and that we weren't worthy of being in their high end restaurant. Even the manager brushed off our request when we asked to change table to the terrace side. We understand that with the whole covid going on it meant that they have to clean everything again which is not convenient and safe. But instead of wasting our time and saying no right away he made it seem like he was going to try even though he wasn't going to anyways. We thank him regardless. The end of the night came and by this time our waiter didn't wanna bother with us anymore and sent his colleague (Joey) to pass the payments with us instead. The bill was close to $1000 and we still tipped 20% even with the bad service. Joey was very nice and promised to take care of us next time we come back but we kindly declined. The girl upstairs at the washroom was also very kind and happily offered to take pictures for us. I have never felt so little and looked down upon at any restaurant like that before. They say ""you will forget the things people say but never the way they made you feel"" and thanks to Beatrice I will never forget my 30th birthday dinner."

After we were made to feel right at home, in their lovely restaurant, we enjoyed a fine glass of Italian wine and a classic Bellini cocktail, with scrumptious bread. Our fantastic waiter (David) went out of his way, to help ""create"" a NEW dish for me, by combining the ingredients of two separate dishes (which the chef was able to reproduce, perfectly)! My wife had a delicious grilled shrimp, with lobster & tomato bisque on black risotto meal, which was fabulous. The service was impeccable along with the decor and we can't wait to return, the next time we're in Montréal."

Today at lunch was the time to finally try it. I was right, it is absolutely gorgeous. It's bright and shiny décor with neutral color and lovely light arrangements. It is quite classy and chic with even a tree in the corner. I've heard the terrace is fantastic but the cold winter storm outside was not ideal for that. I'll try it another time 4 course meal:A creamy, lovely Mozzarella di buffala with fresh tomatoes, pesto, tasty olive oil and crispy bread was the first course. And it started out strong. I was not hungry anymore after this first plate. Very traditional but very well done. The olive oil was really bringing the dish together.Next was a plate of fresh tomato pasta. It might seem simple and ordinary like that but it was seriously one of the best tomato spaghetti I had. There was a superb depth of taste.Main course was veal and a mushroom sauce which was fantastic with the brunellos I had in my glass. Italian wine with Italian food ;) It wasn't as fresh and delicious as the first two but it was still very pleasant.Then we had a huge plate of sweets. It seems they have a pastry chef of their own which is quite rare nowadays. Cream cheese and white chocolate ball was to die for. The cookies were delicious. A very cute lemon meringue mini pie. Brownie, cake, fruits, etc. So much stuff!!This is what Italian restaurant should be like, classy with good typical ingredients."

/user_details?userid=-ZEb0DgVva5CkS0FfAKmsg,Grace L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When passing by Sherbrook, I always become curious and have been wanting to visit this restaurant. So I had big ""yes!"" when my friend asked me to hang out for a lunch- it serves a three-course meal at $25 on weekdays! Not surprisingly, the ambiance was fancy and quite. It will be a perfect spot for a romantic dinner, but also for a lunch with a business meeting. I thought the openness widening the whole view as one would be perfect for events such as a wedding reception. The service was well-sophisticated - not overly strong and kind (such as sometimes stopping on-going conversations on the table by explaining the menu), very appropriate, in terms of full - caring of tables but not driving unnecessary attention.The only downside may be the food. (Alert! I am not fair - as I paid only $25 for the three-course meal. ) The taste was OK, not super, super delicious but can definitely say above average. I had Kale salad, duck breast, and a chocolate cake. The duck meat was kind of cold (not freshly served right after cooking) as if I get the steaks somewhere an event is going (the food is prepared in advance). I could imagine that the food must have been very tasty if it served after cooking right away. As I said before, I'm not fair as the food taste was way beyond of my expectation with a payment of $25 in downtown Montreal. Good ambiance and service is a plus.  I just wanted to be honest and bring some information, the above comment on the food is not a complaint. It's still worth visit, and I'm actually planning to revisit this place for other occasions."

We were seated in a room with a retractable roof with great accent lighting which set the mood for the evening. We started with the Buffalo Mozzarella and Beef Carpaccio appetizers and they were as good as we've ever had. For dinner we had the Mushroom Rosotto and Chitarra (spaghetti w/mushrooms, basil etc). Both dishes were excellent and flavorful. For dessert they brought out a mocha and chocolate creation that hot the spot. This was compliments of the restaurant. Although expensive, it is well worth it and we would absolutely go back next time we are in town. It was easily the best meal of the vacation. By the way the service was excellent which is not the norm for Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came to Bice for a wedding reception and frankly it's a beautiful resto with a huge terrace that is quite aesthetically pleasing. The entrance was converted for the reception to a cocktail party and then afterwards into a dance floor. The music was great!What stood out for me was the service, it was impeccable! The staff was fantastic all night long, accommodating and friendly. My glass of water was never less than half full. The waiters walked around at the start of the evening with glasses of champagne and a wide variety of goodies. I particularly enjoyed the lamb.As for Italian restos go, we have to take into consideration that Bice is gastronomic first and foremost. If you're coming here for dinner, don't expect your traditional Italian experience with a small ""Casa Di Mama"" resto but rather the work of a renowned chef performing his trade. So, expect beautiful plates that are hopefully big on flavor and beauty but rather small on portion size. You can also expect this experience to make more of an impact to your wallet but as I was a guest, the only thing that came out of my wallet was the donation I made to the bride and groom.I went with their octopus for an appetizer, their gnocchi and then the filet mignon (not a fan of fish as it was the only other option!). Overall, I was thought they were OK but nothing that would make me want to come back, particularly at the price-tag that they ask for. The octopus was alright but once again, quite tiny in a very lovely huge plate. Something was in it that didn't make me like it very much.The gnocchi was good and the serving was a bit more generous than the octopus but I've enjoyed far better. The sauce was in particular was average. The biggest disappointment was the filet mignon. Filet mignon to me doesn't hold much flavor due to it having no fat on it. It was classic back in the day that sadly still lives to its reputation and obviously it's expensive due to it. Insane! It's simply not a flavorful piece of meat on its own to me. If it was wrapped/under something fatty (such as bacon or cheese) to enhance the flavor it would be better but alas, it wasn't. An unimaginative slab of meat was served. Fat is good people, especially on meats, try it!!!All in all, there are simply much better cuts of meat out there.I'd give the food a 3 and the service and decor a 5."

They opened early with very short notice for my party of 15 on a Saturday afternoon.  Everyone had a beautiful meal, food was excellently prepared, wine was excellent, ambiance superb. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful dinner spot. Recommendation: squid ink pasta was out of this world, get it in an appetizer portion so you can also try something else.  Everything on the menu is good."
/user_details?userid=CNAmYSmFY9KaWYWvQtKg9A,Nadine T.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,Terrible menu. Expensive prices and all for show. Restaurant owners are so lazy they can't even provide good produce that is organic. Are the meats even hormone free? Why pay money to eat and make people sick. Very disappointed. Spend your money elsewhere.

The staff are young and fun, no attitude, the food was excellent, my dish was tasty, creative, and beautifully served. There was a private party on the terrace, so we were entertained with some of the totally outlandish outfits on the guests. Staggeringly high heels with bare toes on the snow??  Dresses with open backs to the waist and décolletage practically the same??  In the snow??? Bread was amazing, squishy and tasty, not the usual dried out baguette served in most restaurants.Absolutely nothing negative to say."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here for our six month anniversary. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now so I was excited to go and have a romantic date night. The resto is so cute! I like the lights everywhere, the one wall of what looks like fake grass and the tree in front that has become part of the establishment. When she showed up the ceiling was partially opened and then they closed it because it was too cold. On a warm summer night I think it would be very romantic to look up at the sky.I had a bloody Caesar and my boyfriend had a gin tonic. We shared the burrata with proscuitto, basil pesto, country bread and  tomatoes. I had the tagliolini pasta with lobster. It was good. I hate to compare but I prefer the lobster pasta at Joe beef. My boyfriend had the grilled 20 oz. rib steak with homemade fries. It was so charred!! It was black on the outside but the inside was OK. I took a bite and I felt so bad for my boyfriend. I told the waiter the steak was burnt and he was nice enough to bring another one and that one was better. I usually never send fold back but it wasn't a cheap steak and I didn't want the guy to eat a steak he wasn't enjoying. I almost gave this resto three stars but because in the end they redeemed themselves I gave them four stars. I really had high hopes for this resto but I  probably will not come back."

The seasoning of it was just ssooo right and it was melting in my mouth just woow to the point that i can have it everyday . Everything here is to perfection . The service was amazing . I asked for something out of the menu and they did it for me. Which it shows me how much they care about their customers and not just denying their demand without even trying . The atmosphere is nice and a best place to go for a date ! super romantic . One of the places that I recommend 100% .

Until we tried this place! You guys, this spot is amazing. Here are the reasons why: 1. Ambience. Mood lighting; romantic setting; with great music in the background. 2. Decor. The walls, the lighting, the tables, everything. Top quality. 3. The food!! Beyond amazing. We had the Burrata to start, which was phenomenal. Our entrees were perfection. And for dessert, we went with the recommended cannoli. It comes with 3 per order, and my husband and I devoured it within a minute. Beyond amazing. The filling was perfect consistency, and the flavor was the best I've ever had. 4. Customer Service. We've been here for 6 days, and this was the only spot that understood what real customer experience means. Definitely felt like everyone there cared about their craft. I can go on and on. My fave spot in Montreal hands down. I wish I can take this restaurant back with me to LA. Trust me, you have to eat here! I'm so surprised they don't have more reviews!"

The service was very impressive for a large restaurant- drinks were refilled attentively and waiters were friendly and knowledge despite being a primarily English speaker (more than I can say for most Québécois restaurants). Beatrice really excels in service and we had a lovely evening here."

There is a nice selection of Italian items with a nice touch of sophistication.The only downside for us seemed to be the service. At one point our server seemed like he had too much stuff to take care and some minor things were forgotten.Overall, a nice experience and would certainly come back in a future visit in Montreal."

We were a large group of about 23 people and they were very accommodating. Didn't force us to order a la carte. Were quick to take our orders and bring out the food. And gave separate bills. Also they put us on a large table that was wide and not just long, so you can see everyone. I thought that was nice. They forgot to bring my rose wine. I got the veal which was good and sizable. It's a very very thin piece of meat covered in arugula salad. My hubby got the filet mignon which was delicious but small. It's a pricey restaurant. They have valet parking."

Had the papardelle with rose sauce and buffala mozzarella.  Delicious and perfect. The fish specials were wonderfully and plentiful.  We had the swordfish and sea bass.  So good and fresh perfect for a summer's day!!  The terrace is stunning and the patio out front is great except they still allow smoking in the patio.  Unappetizing except we lucked out that the wind was not blowing the smoke towards our table.  It is frequented by Stereotypical caricatures of European party crowd but if you are lucky it can be a nicer crowd.  I would go here for lunch to experience the terrace again.

After hanging up , i thought about it , and relized that the 30th was a sunday , not a saturday... So clearly the man on the phone didn't even look into the shedule. he just assumed, and or didn't care. After realizing this i checked to see if i could make a reservation online , to get around the man who clearly has no interest in booking a rezo. I successfully made a reservation ..... or so i thought. A few days later , maybe a week or so ( it was a monday they called ) i got a call from someone in the evening to tell me there was a glitch in their system , and they have a wedding booked for the 30th.that was it. thats how it ended. now its my wifes birthday this weekend , and im gonna look like an a-hole."

/user_details?userid=KIUeZpqA5DpQZIhcBwQVvQ,Seema M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We are considering Bice to cater our wedding in the Fall. Because it was the holiday season and they were too booked up to do a tasting, we decided to try out their restaurant.7pm on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was relatively quiet for the holiday season. We arrived a bit early and wanted to get a drink at the bar which is located near the back end of the restaurant. The bartender was clueless and when I asked her for a cocktail menu she immediately said they didn't have one. The manager gave her an odd look and then she said ""oops yes we do actually have one"" and handed it to me. I had a nice glass of red wine (pricey!) and bf had beer. We were escorted to our table and immediately given a pretty plate of bruschetta and 3 dips. (see pics) I loved the garlicy one! I think this is a complimentary dish they give customers as I saw everyone getting them.I ordered a pasta dish (to test out for the wedding) and he ordered the filet mignon. The pasta was average- a bit oily and nothing special. He enjoyed his filet mignon, but nothing TOO special. The portion was really large which was surprising.After our main courses, the waiter came out and gave us complimentary ""the grand finale"" which was amazing! There was two of each of their desserts: creme brulee, chocolate souffle, chocolate ganache, etc. Just delicious! The presentation of the dishes was lovely but the food lacked quality and flavour for the reputation Bice holds. However, the dessert was to die for! Note- Bice's catering menu is apparently very different from the restaurant. Will update after our tasting in March."

She forgot to ask for patio seating, while they told us it wasn't available, we arrived and were surprised that indeed we were to be seated outside in the lovely patio. The ambiance was amazing - everything about this place was exquisite. We started with a few apps: Calamari, octupus, crab cakes, tuna tartare, carpaccio and the beat salad. While the crab cake was the winner, all others were fantastic as well. BTW- we're a party of 10 and all are big eaters.. My main enteree was the Chilean Sea bass, my hubby ordered the lobster linguine. I dont recall what else was ordered, but I can certainly say that all dishes were sent back empty and we all make several comments throughout the meal on how delicious it all was. For our dessert - we ordered the sampler: Ice cream, cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate lava cake, bread pudding and fruit. I would absolutely recommend that you order the same should you desire dessert. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was attentive and kind.. I'm unsure when I'll be bank in Montreal, but one things for sure.. Bice will be on the agenda.."

The inside of the restaurant seems a bit small, but that only adds to the intimacy of the place. The tables were well spaced so it wasn't crowded.THE FOOD: We started off with the ""Fried crab cake, lime and black pepper mayo, grilled corn, cucumber and coriander salsa"" ($17). I don't normally eat seafood, let alone any kind of shellfish, but this was AMAZING. The mayo was crazy good...you know those Miss Vickie's Lime and Cracked Black Pepper chips? It tasted like that. Only in MAYO FORM!For the main course, the boyfriend ordered the ""Rigatoncini, Italian sausage, tomatoes, smoked caciocavallo and bufal"" ($24) whereas I had the ""Pappardelle ""rosé"" with mozzarella di bufala and fresh basil"" ($24). The pappardelle was cheesey, but not too cheesey, and in my opinion, was better than the rigatoncini, which was good as well. The only reason why Bice doesn't warrant 5 stars is because the wait staff is made up of young boys, who are either overly eager, clearing our dishes and cutlery as soon as we had put it down, or super forgetful. But other than that, everything was memorable."

My wife ordered the seafood risotto and it was undercooked. Had to ask for bread for the table and they never brought any butter or olive oil.

The atmosphere was dull and they played a house music loop that made you want to fall asleep.

This is not the sort of place I would usually bring my toddler to, as it is very upscale and elegant, but for an early supper out we thought, ""why not ?"" as I was dying to try this place on a recent visit to Montreal. The waitstaff was more than friendly and accommodating and never made us feel out of place. We opted to stay indoors as it was a particularly chilly evening, but they have the most beautiful terrace for warmer evenings. The inside of the restaurant has a contemporary/modern elegance set in a neutral color palette, with comfortable tables and banquette seating around the perimeter. The food certainly lived up to their reputation as one of Montreal's finest. We shared tender crab cakes, succulent grilled octopus and plump shrimp tempura with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. My husband also sampled the rare seared fillet mignon with wild mushrooms that he raved about. They brought us a cracker and dip platter with three dips (a guacamole, eggplant caviar and white bean puree), and I can tell you I secretly wanted to lick the little dish clean of the white bean it was so good! For entree' I had a Chilean Sea Bass with saffron lobster risotto and spinach, with the largest chunks of lobster I'd ever seen in even a main dish, never mind as a side! I could've eaten a whole bowl of just the risotto, it was amazing, but then to top it with a tender and flaky Chilean Sea Bass?! I was in heaven...The waiter suggested the Cavatelli for my three year-old, and I could kiss him for that, as I had never seen my son eat so much in one sitting! The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the tomato sauce was perfect in it's simplicity, the best I've eaten. My husband, who is not a pasta fan, soon finished off what my little guy couldn't and I dipped my bread into the last traces of that delicious sauce. We finished off our feast with a dessert sampling of homemade sorbets (refreshing and delicious), warm chocolate souffle (wow!), mini tiramisu cups, cheesecake bites and a nutty bar that was amazing! If you are in Montreal and looking for a fantastic meal in an elegant environment, do not miss Bice, it's a must try!"
