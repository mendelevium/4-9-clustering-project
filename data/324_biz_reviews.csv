However, they do have two tables of 4 seats. They are on ubereats, doordash and skip the dishes!  The owner is the same as Rasoi which is right across the street. We tried a few entrees and we loved their homemade pogo's made from scratch which were absolutely delicious!  The batter was so good!  We also had the jerk kitchen salad which was the most amazing delicious salad ever!  Their jerk chicken is absolutely to die for! Super flavorful , most and tender!  Next we shared their burgers and our favorite were the chicken and pork jerk burgers!! Yummy so original flavors and amazing!  This place is a true find in the St-henri area!  Definately recommend to try it!! I will definately go back.  Oh and forgot to mention ,  they have a great selection of Jamaican imported drinks! Check out the pics!"

I always passed by the restaurant, and was very curious about it. Finally it showed up on the UberEats app; I got very excited. I was very very happy that the menu has the vegetarian option. I ordered the jerk mushroom poutine. It came in a clear plastic bowl, and it was nicely presented. The poutine was delicious and it went beyond my expectations. Perfect amount of each ingredients. I can't wait to try other meals in menu with vegetarian options."

But in their defence they were super busy, which in these times were restaurants aren't surviving, good for them! What I will say tho is the food was VERY GOOD! Lost 2 points for that wait! But I must pay my respect where it's due! The jerk was bomb!"
