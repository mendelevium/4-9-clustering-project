It was heaven, a little hole in the wall. Glad we took a chance to come here. It is a classic diner style, casual place. But boy does the food say otherwise ! Surprised to find they served eggs Benedict! In a variety of options and toppings. We had the smoked salmon selection. They have crepes and waffles too, which we tried the Strawberries and nutella style. French toast with strawberries! And a classic breakfast with sunnyside up eggs! The service is friendly, efficient and fast. Our food all came quickly and piping hot. The eggs Benedict was on a bed of spinach and smoked salmon. It was a rich creamy hollandaise sauce as well! Over all I recommend this place to others who are coming up to MTL that may be lost like I was looking for food."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was looking with my folks where to brunch in St. Laurent. We found this restaurant and lettme tell you, we were so glad we chose this spot for brunch.This location looks like a classic American dinner restaurant. The service was particularly friendly and charming. They treated us like grandma's favorite grandkids, and spoiled us with love.We ordered two brunches, and one to share. Tip: you pay $3 extra dollars but it is so worth it. The food was overflowing and the fruit was exquisite. Freshness was its First name. I would've never thought I would have such nice time here. Never judge a book by its cover.Their flaw is their regular coffee. Their cappuccinos are good. Hence, ask for a coffee that is not pre-made.Conclusion. You will end so full that the rest of the restaurants on St. Laurent will make you look away."

So many lovely egg Benedict options and egg combos.  The waffles and hot cakes are very tasty.   Coffee is very good and the service comes with friendly smiles.

Old school diner vibe and some great food. We came here for brunch and there was a line out of the door, we waited for 15 mins before getting to our table. Menu is exhaustive, typical american diner fare with few pages of menu nto scroll from. We went with the pancaked, french toast and eggs, everything arrived quickly and food was really good. Service was on par and I'd definitely recommend stopping by here."

The food was delicious, the service was friendly and prompt. We are only here a few days and are planning on coming back! Their French Toast is fantastic, their assortment of Benedicts is to die for, and my picky family of eaters was happy with everything!"
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have a weird interest in the north american family dining experience. The utilitarianism of the wipe-down surfaces and stainless steel kitchens, the bustling staff who fill up your coffee just like they do in diners in the movies, and most of all, the menu: that 200-page laminated, illustrated novel that contains, without fail, every combination of food known to man. Chicken wings? Yeah! Eggs Benedict? Of course! Pizza, tacos, burgers, pie? We have them all!This place is one of those, and though I like to tell myself I come here just for quick and easy fuel, the truth is that I love the experience and the food is always good. Do I wish the beans were a bit more generously portioned? Yes. I love beans. But do they make up for it by piling your plate high with every other breakfast food known to man? YOU BET. The staff here are so lovely, too - or perhaps it's just the one lady I've had on three occasions who, I'll be honest, I'm a little bit in love with. Not only was she kind and receptive, she even recommended the sharing plate - which is basically two breakfasts for the price of 1.2 breakfasts. WHAT!This place isn't going to blow you away with fine dining, but it will take care of that tum rumble in ten thousand lovingly-made ways, and that's just what you need sometimes."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A classic brunch diner type place. Decor is super old school, and it was super busy when I went, so atmosphere was bumping! Seating a bit crowded but it's a cozy, no frills place.Menu is expansive, the usual pancakes, eggs Benedict, French toast, omelette type of deal. They give you huge portions! Food is made exactly the way you'd expect it to be. We got the bagel lox platter and the bacon avocado eggs Benedict. The poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was PERFECT.    Best hollandaise I've had by far.Service is speedy. They also refill your coffee continuouslyPrices are competitive, you get a lot of food for the price you pay. Would come back!"
/user_details?userid=kSz3wSUHilFrXuop8QnLZA,Elizabeth G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",5 star rating,This place did not let down. So many food chocices and everything we ordered was delicious. Very generous portions. The London steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Every single bite of the steak will melt in your mouth. Chocolate pancakes.. OMG so many chocolate chips. And it's a huge plate of pancakes; the kids could not finish it.

This place was here for ages, on the saint-laurent street.I go there from time to time with my friends for a brunch; my favorite is the festin #2, it comes with eggs, bacon, sausages and a buttermilk chocolate chips pancake."
/user_details?userid=ECkQu2mmMz7PsjCyxeGqdw,Vanessa A.,"Salem, NH",4 star rating,Great breakfast! Loved the round home fried potatoes and not greasy.  The server was great and the portions are generous. Bacon was crispy. This is a small place you are just about having your breakfast with your neighbor. We had to wait five minutes for a party of two. The bigger the party the longer the wait.  The crepes with strawberry was perfect with my perfect cappuccino. The best of it all was the price!!!! We were shocked with a $18 breakfast for two. We will come back every time we are in Montreal.   Oh the food comes out pretty quickly!
/user_details?userid=qeTXfn1kW1VukLXKrAXQQw,Bishoy G.,"University Heights, Newark, NJ",5 star rating,"Amazing food, very big portions and great service! Would come again. We came for breakfast and hoped for the best, not knowing what to expect but it seriously exceeded expectations. Only complaint even thought it didn't change the restaurant experience as a whole was the fact that there was no working AC. They did however have fans around to accommodate. Great service as well!"

After my previous favorite cheap brunch spot closed (Place Milton), I was in search of a replacement, and this place seems to fit the bill. It has a pretty wide menu with all of your classic brunch favorites- I recommend their bagel breakfast sandwiches (and the home fries/potatoes). It's definitely not the best food you've ever tasted, but for the quick service and relatively cheap prices, it's a great spot. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a diner-style brunch."

/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Mediocre Food. Poor Service.The eggs are meh, the pancakes taste synthetic, the fruit is rarely fresh, the beans are mushy, and the potatoes are lackluster to say the least. The condiments containers are also often filthy, with the bottles either greasy or covered in caked-on content.sThe only reason I eat here is because it is around the corner from my house. If you're on the Plateau looking for a place to brunch, there are several other places you should consider first -- e.g. Bagels Etc., L'Evidence, Universel, and the list goes on.They're also prone to messing up orders, whether eating-in or getting take-out.In a word, not really worth a stop-in unless you're literally around the corner and too hungover/tired to go any further."
/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There are so many options on this menu; it would take forever to try every single item on it. I don't understand how they provide so much selection. Buttermilk pancakes? Baked beans? Omelette? French toast? Eggs benedict? Would you like the Festin number 1 which is unlimited coffee refills, two eggs, two pancakes, three slices of bacon, ham, sausage, baked beans, breakfast potatoes, toast and meat pate? I got it and I was so full I had to take the pancakes home with me. I was full for the whole day and the meal was only $13?!! It's a great deal for the amount of food you get. Not super fancy, but a great casual restaurant to go to after a late night out or a brunch treat for one's self. I probably won't come again since i like to try different brunch places but for it's price point it's a great brunch place to go to."

Large varied menu, good portions and cheap! Ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce @ $10 from the lunch menu. Expected it to be mediocre Americanised bolognese & heavy on the tomatoes, but it was delicious. I almost finished the whole giant plate. Interior is your typical aged-looking diner, with no frills, but the food is great and hits the spot."

Large portions, almost all menu items include a free coffee with refills. Usually quite busy, but staff are very friendly and meals are prepared quickly and surprisingly isn't too loud. Their tables and chairs are small which is a bit annoying but the diner is worth it nevertheless, definitely family friendly and is amazing as hang-over food."

We enjoyed the omelettes we ordered plus we got a side of challah French toast. It is reasonable in cost and they had tons of choices from waffles to pancakes. The home fries are excellent.

I decided to have the traditional Eggs Benedict, and they were delectable! Of course, the eggs were cooked perfectly...not under-cooked or overcooked. The Hollandaise sauce was very rich, and they give you a generous amount of sauce as well. The potatoes that were served with the meal were also great, not to heavy, but very light. And, of course, it comes with the traditional fruit arrangement that seems to be popular in Montreal. This meal was the perfect size...it was filling but didn't bog you down. Easily, one of the best breakfasts I have had in Montreal, or even anywhere. Highly recommend!"

They had various options so everyone I was with had no problem choosing a meal. I rated this four stars because we decided to combine checks and our waitress charged us more. I think she just made a mistake because she was pretty busy! But other than that, I would recommend this place for food! It was very great"
/user_details?userid=2ve6A6wvhr1rBk0zNlDGfw,Steph S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The most classic Main diner style breakfasts and atmosphere. Expect at line if you're there after 10-11am on a Saturday Sunday . Join the hungover students and hipsters as they recount their epic nights over greasy breaky and bottomless coffee. As it should be.
/user_details?userid=G6HW7nzfAGgKIJh-jYOIZQ,Jamie K.,"Kansas City, MO",4 star rating,This place has everything. We came for breakfast and there was something for every taste. The Lunch-Dinner menu was also extensive. Glad we found it!
/user_details?userid=PK8otG3_4QmiuNlbWgpF6w,Gregory C.,"Long Beach, IN",4 star rating,"This place has a nice, unassuming feel. It's a cozy diner without any frills. For $6, you can get an egg, sausage, hash browns, that usual choice of ""bread,"" and coffee. The food is cheap but good (don't get anything with spinach: I'm looking at you, eggs Benedict), and the best part is that there's never a line. Ever. It's so vexing going to brunch and waiting in line for half an hour or going to a place and deciding it's not worth waiting and then finding another place to go. Not here: they actually put tables in their restaurant instead of couches and bean bags and decorative body dancers. It's not something to show off (unless you're showing it off to someone who asked to go to a diner), but it's convenient."

I'm a sucker for well-worn diners, and that is exactly what we found here. Luckily, we were early enough to grab a table - this is a very popular spot, and the crowd at the entrance was thick at the entrance when we left. Food is diner food, and that's perfect for a weekend morning. I had the smoked salmon omelette and I really enjoyed it. Large portions, bottomless coffee and typically neutral service (they just need to keep pushing the customers through) were expected and received.  For the portions and the ""greasy spoon"" atmosphere, I'll be back."

STRIKE ONE..................thankfully our waiter was great, and he did get a great tip...............the food, mediocre to say the least, how can you advertise shish kebab, and serve a souvlaki on a stick? STIKE TWO; too emabrrased to cause a scene, thanks to my daughters common sense.  The chicken and shrimp get 3 stars , only because the chicken was delicious, as were the potatoes, unfortunately the shrimp was limp and soggy, (this is a $24 plate)............whatever, it was a crappy experience, and i suggest the manager learn that the customer is who needs to be happy and not his overbloated ego,nothwistanding that it was a stressful night...............we went for a change this year..............big mistake................"

We waited about an hour between the time we ordered our food and the time it was placed in front of us. The waitress said that it was always that busy on Saturdays but I felt that we could have been warned as we were extremely famished once we arrived and were literally going stir crazy watching people eating around us.Despite this major setback our food that arrived was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon wasn't too fatty and it came with a small cup of fruit and unlimited coffee which we really needed. The homefries were my favorite part and I would go back just for those.Overall, I am pleased with the food but felt that the service should have informed us of the long wait ahead so we could plan accordingly."

First of all, we had to switch tables and they were incredibly rude about it. They made us move our drinks and place settings! Then it took them 15 minutes to even bring us water and menus (it was also impossible to get a refill on my water. That took 20 minutes). The waitress also had no idea what was on the menu. They had items on their menu that they ""haven't had in months."" Seriously, how hard is it to print a new menu? Overall all the staff were very disorganized and that ruined the meal.  Would not go back.  Also, side note: if you're going to have an open kitchen, it should look clean. This did not."

Like fries but in the shape of breakfast potatoes.Breakfast served until 4pm, Interac and credit cards accepted, you can easily get out of Le Vieux St-Laurent for two under $15."
