The brews are great but then Canada is known for its beer! Really nice atmosphere, local kinda bar. We came for a quick drink before dinner with my old friend. We found it casual, fun and the staff attentive. Local so French primary  language but some spoke English. So enjoyed our beer.Definitely recommended!"
/user_details?userid=uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,"Came by here as part of a brewery tour to get some food and some drinks (obviously). Dimly lit but spacious interior with the usual wooden tables all around. Sat our giant party at the middle of the restaurant without feeling cramped.Beer list keeps at a standard $6.50 price point, but you get a different pour depending on style. First tried the ""Milkshake IPA"" (12 oz) - a silky smooth dark beer, with not too much hop for an IPA. Also had the ""Altbier""  (crisp lingering ale), and the ""Grisette"" (moderate saison). For food, had the off-menu Poutine - a basic layering of fries, gravy and curds. The cheese curds were large but chewy and the fries could have been warmer.Service is definitely attentive as we were the largest group in the brewpub. Good place to have a drink at the bar if stopping by."

I also love love the ambiance. I highly recommend to try the fried cheese, so good I've ordered it twice. No regrets. Also the fried chicken is tender and crispy, but the sauces are phenomenal!!!! Thé tartare was good, the only let down, which is a big no no is the octopus which was overcooked and smelled fishy. However, I also recommend trying the stout!!! Always love coming here for a chill evening with friends."
/user_details?userid=uMXd8CpiPSVc694wcG3YZQ,Amanda T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Came here with a friend for a drink and a bite to eat. We ordered fries with house mayo and salmon tartare to share with a pint of beer each. This was my first time trying salmon tartare and I really enjoyed it. Good food and service.
/user_details?userid=E0xkEg8xzChrriYOqaqlvw,Hadley H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5 star rating,"LOVE THIS PLACE! We were staying nearby and literally came here three nights in a row. The staff is so nice, the food is great, and the beer is amazing! The vibe is chill but definitely busy and happening. There's a cool outdoor area, but we mainly stayed at the bar. The burger is probably the best deal for what you get and is sooo good! The tacos were also good, but not necessarily exceptional. I'd come back for the beer and ambiance any day."
/user_details?userid=uz5-sq6wHrXScrIWb8r1Mg,Karen K.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"My party was getting the munchies for burgers, so we turned to Boswell. Where we were staying, there were mainly pubs, and Boswell was the highest rated one.It was busy at 6:30pm ish when my party arrived, which means this joint is very popular in the area.  This was a good sign.  Decor-wise, it has the standard pub fixtures like dim lighting, wooden furniture, and brick walls. It seems to be both date and family friendly.  The servers here are very enthusiastic and friendly.  They speak in English and French, so they can accomodate most tourists.  The only negative point I have for the service is the long time it took to get any request completed.  It took ten minutes to get our bill and it also took about 30 minutes to get our food.  Our group noticed this slower service at every restaurant we went to in Montreal and we think maybe it's only a difference in view point. We come from Toronto, where everyone is zipping from one place to another, so maybe we are just used to faster service.  If you're fine with staying longer to eat and drink, then Boswell will have appropriate service for you. For drinks, they have a menu full of home brewed beers. Unfortunately, I forgot the name of the one I ordered, but it was a light beer with a sweet mango syrup. I'm sure a server can point you to the item I'm referencing.  The beer was not overly sweet and had a nice sour note to it. I really enjoyed it and thought it was very reasonably priced for the 12 oz I received. I mean 6.5 bucks after tax for home brewed beer? This deal is bomb!For food, I ordered the beef burger with double patties. My bf ordered the beef burger with a single patty and the mac and cheese. If you're going with the burger, go with the double because the size difference is massive.  The burger itself was ok.  The meat was overly charred and the fillings didn't wow me, so I can't really justify the high price, especially since it didn't even come with a side.  My bf enjoyed the mac and cheese, but I prefer mac and cheese that oozes with strings of cheese everywhere, so I was not as impressed.  If you love to have an abundance of cheese on your food, skip on the mac and cheese here. Overall, our experience here was alright.  Service was standard and so was our impression of the food. If you're in a pinch looking for a dinner spot late at night and want to try some home brewed beers, then by all means head off to Boswell!  In my opinion, their beers are  the way of go!"
/user_details?userid=0ROkAlAJNf4zu4eypWrZNg,Kalen L.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"I was rolling solo and popped in here for a quick bite at around 6:30pm (ie. not overly busy yet) and requested a table that wasn't in the back corner. I was told that I could sit at the bar or a bench table so long as I was done by 8pm. Really? If you're trying to make someone feel unwelcome then mission accomplished. Management take note and train your staff better. Any one who is dining on their own, I highly recommend Poke Bol just down the street - super good food but lacking tasty beer."

/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I consider Boswell my second home. I have been there countless times since their opening in 2015. They always have a great selection of micro-brewery beers, local ciders and one kombucha.  All tap beverages are $6, with the glass size changing depending on the choice and alcohol percentage. They also have a pretty decent selection of local liquors for Shooters or drinks. If you're looking at ordering shots, I strongly suggest you ask for an Hot Shot, which is a mix of Whisky and expresso. The staff is great to help with your selection and they will gladly bring you a sample before you place an order.The food is amazing, the menu is short but they have different items on the menu every week, with seasonal plates. They have free Wi-Fi if you want to go to study or work. The atmosphere is whatever you make it to be;Quiet to study alone Perfect for a date Nice and fun for a small group of friends Party mode for special occasions"
/user_details?userid=RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA,Leanna K.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"We were just looking for a casual place to grab a nice-er dinner, and found this place just 250 meters away from the new apartment. The place was quiet, but it was pretty early on Sunday night, nice darker atmosphere, lots of seating and clean. (Seems like a rad place to bring a pile of friends for a good drink and some yummy food.)Great staff, french only menus but anglo friendly.We got the Westcoast IPA, chicken karaage, fish and chips, and their burger!I'm always so impressed when I find a place that knows how to cook food here in Montreal. The karaage was PERFECT. Crispy, light breading with moist chicken. The fish and chips were the same, beautifully battered and crisp but not greasy. The burger could have been cooked a tiny bit less but it was still delicious. They also have VERY awesome thick-cut fries, I imagine poutine on them is incredible.We'll definitely back either for a few drinks with friends or another nice dinner!"

/user_details?userid=f4FDka9uLxd86W3E31KwYA,Tasken L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was invited by a friend to try out this microbrewery and see if it can become our hangout place. It turned out to be a pretty decent restaurant. They have lots of beers to choose from. I ordered their house beer called west coast which is a strong one but tastes very good. I also tried the pale ale, which has a traditional taste.Then I was asked to be adventurous and try something funky that tastes partly coffee and partly yogurt. It tastes more yogurt...Given this is like a bar we didn't expect much of the food, but the food is actually quite decent. The restaurant has indoor seats but also has a terrace. It has a very nice vibe. I'll probably go back to try some new beer."
/user_details?userid=I8mfczria5yISiy6wTVJ7Q,Valerie F.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We enjoyed a great meal during our time in Montreal! Their beer list is extensive and they have a few beers that they have brewed themselves, which was a nice change of pace. My husband enjoyed one of their IPA's that they brewed along with a brown ale and I enjoyed the framboise cider. (I am keeping my fingers crossed that somehow I will be able to find this in Chicago, as I had it in both Quebec and Montreal as it is DELISH!) The food was very good and the portions were a good size. My husband's fish and chips were nice and crispy and the tartar sauce was very flavorful. I had the chicken fajitas, which was more like a chicken wrap as opposed to fajitas served the way I am used to; however, they were very flavorful and fresh. Service was attentive and not overbearing, which is also appreciated. We will definitely be back if we return to Montreal. ."

I also had food - really nice Salmon Tartar. The service is knowledgeable, good music in background, decorations are minimalistic, Wi-Fi without password. I was here at lunch time and it wasn't busy. If you are looking for a good craft beer, they have it, the food selection is not big. Overall I liked the place and would recommend it"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Wonderful, wonderful pub. Modern, spacious, long tables suitable for bigger or smaller groups. A little bit noisy, but that's fine, it is a pub in the end. Big advantage, no TV screens, love the fact that I can enjoy talking to my friends instead of staring at moving figures on the wall. The beer list is outstanding, beautiful selection of some of the best local beer producers, the two pints I had were delicious. Nice, carefully balanced food menu with snacks, appetizers and some mains options. I went for the crispy calamari that were really crispy, but a little bit over salted. The brew prices are very competitive, six dollars, taxes included. Location wise it is a little bit too far east for me, but parking is so easy to find at this part of Mont Royal street that I have no excuse! I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=nZkY_NNtanTZAsI_61EagQ,Brian G.,"Manchester, MA",5 star rating,Very good brew pub with delicious menu. Beers and ciders are well crafted (The DCRBS Bourbon stout was great!). The Fromage en grains frits is a MUST have (order at least 3!). Service is relaxed (allowing you to enjoy yourself) and waitstaff are friendly (and bilingual). Very happy to have stopped by.

Food was also better than what one would usually expect for a pub."
/user_details?userid=JRxMs1L6vdBCc447RTgBMA,Michel C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This pub is a little closer to home. First time there. Seating is arrange to encourage exchange with your neighbors. Good craft beers and some from other local breweries. My friend and I had a burger and I got a fries as a side. Good food. Fries are home made and just right.

Second time we went for dinner and it turns out it was quiz night, which was a lot of fun. My only complaint: please introduce a vegan (not vegetarian) option to the menu!"
/user_details?userid=vxNjUAnrEPqPjBmIe7F4GQ,Michelle W.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",4 star rating,"Funky atmosphere. We got there around 7,  there was still seating left but was full-up an hour later. Very good pub food a great selection of hand crafted beers and delicious too. The appetizers were all delicious --  fried tofu, cod balls served with yogurt and a really fresh 'relish' and some chicken bites that were also very yummy -- all fried so if you are on a diet...but well worth the splurge!For the main I had the Hamburger and fries -- the burger was very tasty ( quite the stack ), my only complaint is that the burger was a bit dry. I asked for it medium and was told, that by law they are not allowed to serve it that way and have to cook it to temp -- husband had fish and chips and they were crispy on the outside and fluffy and moist on the inside , fires are very good -- generous portionVery reasonably priced and well worth it.Almost forgot to mention the wait staff was very friendly and attentive also. Thank you!"
/user_details?userid=ezZQrMKFmrIS7gZi0pIUqw,Adam S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A very nice place in the extreme east plateau.  We had the burger and the fish and chips off the limited afternoon menu.  The burger was quite good, maybe lacking a distinct flavor or character, but with nicely seasoned beef cooked absolutely perfectly - between medium and medium-rare.  The fish was very lightly breaded with a very light flavor.  The tartar sauce was tasty with an accent of dill.  This is of course also a brew pub and I sampled a couple of their beers.  The Saison Mixte was excellent; a spicy white beer with a hint of sour.  My girlfriend had the one cider on the menu and it was also very good, not overly sweet with an appealing sour note.My girlfriend felt it was important to add that the music selection was terrible.  I'll add that while that's true at least it was at a low enough volume to ignore."

/user_details?userid=_EqqTWb1YbNppyZIwJdUjA,Nadege B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Spacious but still a warm atmosphere. Very friendly and attentive staff.Considering it's about the only place in this neighborhood I was afraid it would be much more about the brewery than the food but I was happily surprised. Food is actually very tasty and portions are just perfect.Not a 5* because I found it a bit pricey though.
/user_details?userid=3iyyROKyMeXD6v68AKC-_g,Saskia K.,"Hamilton, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! Words cannot describe how amazing our meal here was last Saturday evening. This was a meal to remember with amazing service, highest quality food, beautiful ambiance, and it didn't break the bank! You MUST try this place!The restaurant was situated in a sparser stretch of rue Mont Royal. It didn't particularly beckon us in from the street but it was packed with patrons - our first clue that we were in for a treat. My boyfriend and I shared several of the appetizers (salmon tartare, calamari, beet salad and duck prosciutto plate). The food was beautifully presented and SO GOOD. Flavourful, fresh, and using high quality ingredients. The beer was also very very good. Our server Jeremy was friendly, helpful and very genuine. We had nice conversation and he gave us recommendations for other eateries during our time in Quebec. This is a must-try when you are in Montreal. Just down the street from la Distillerie and a short drive to the bustling St Denis strip with more bars and clubs."

The second my beers were finished, she was ready to get me a new one! I sat at the bar, which was great because I was able to watch what was going on in the kitchen. The tables are also wonderful, spacious and can seat a large group. The crowd was a mix of old and young, classy and rowdy. The food was great as well (tip is included in the price). My boyfriend and I ordered the beef tartare and two of the specials (Kaage Chicken with a delicious kimchi, and A Calamari and Chorizo dish that was ok-the sauce was a bit smoky but not bad).They serve popcorn as a snack for $5 and all beers are $6.Great experience, check it out."

Despite not having English menus on hand, all the staff speak great English so feel free to ask them to explain the dishes to you. Our meal arrived quite a while later, prob 30 mins but it was quite busy that Saturday night. I ordered a tofu vegetarian burger which I knew was going to be risky - but it was amazing & full of flavour. The brioche bun was perfectly sized & fresh, there was some sliced tofu, mushroom, Swiss chard and dijonnaise which came together in a blissful combination. The serve of frites with the burgers are quite generous so if that doesn't satisfy you I don't know what will!"

However, the space itself is cold and sterile, and the service was inattentive. We waited a good 15 minutes for someone to come take our order, and after we were served, it's like the staff forgot about us. Many of them were chatting amongst themselves behind the bar. I won't be returning."
