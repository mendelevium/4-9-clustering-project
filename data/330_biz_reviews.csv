This place is great for college students or young adults. We went here twice and both times the music was great and they even show music videos on all the tvs which is pretty cool. The drinks are a good price and the ENTIRE menu is $5.95. I almost couldn't believe it. I got the chicken tacos and they were amazing. I really don't get why people say the ""cheap"" food is terrible. I thought it was great quality. Even looking around at other peoples meals and the portions they were getting I coudn't believe they only charge $5.95.Highly reccomend this place for anyone in their 20s."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I think the concept of a warehouse resonates with this theme of this restobar: subpar service, cheap food and student joint. The atmosphere is lively. Heading there around 5 pm, the waitress placed us at a table with two bar stools. Considering the place was still empty, I asked her if I could move to the booth in the back corner, she said it is reserved for parties of 3. Within 10 minutes of that conversation, I see 2 girls sit down in the same booth. Is there confusion? The drink specials weren't incredible, but I settled for a margarita cocktail that was ok. Alongside, oh dear the chicken wings?! I don't know if  the chicken died on my plate but it was really not presentable- no ranch dressing, carrot or celery sticks (oh right you need to pay a dollar extra). The Mac n cheese was pretty decent for a 5-10$ meal. Regardless of the experience, a 16$ bill can never disappoint!  It is a hangout spot on ""crescent"" street."

Service was very slow. Took them 50 minutes for plates to arrive, mine never arrived. So I told the waiter about it. He went to check in the kitchen and waited for another 30 minutes (they double charged me on that plate).We ate outside, then it started raining very hard, so we paid very quickly. Got charged for 6 plates instead of 4. I returned there 2 days later telling them about the situation. They don't want to do anything. No refund, no meal. Don't want to own up for their own mistake. Stay away"

This location has a lower and upper patio, and appeared to be one of the biggest ones I've seen! Ordered some classics: Mac & Cheese and Asian Noodle salad. For drinks, highly recommend the Corona Sour Key. The staff was very friendly and spoke both English and French, while creating a welcoming environment!"

The music was on the louder side, but not too loud to have a conversation. We tried a variety of drinks and shooters, which we enjoyed. We had the potato skins and corn queso dip appetizers, which were both very good. I had the grilled cheese with poutine as a side, which was delicious. The portions weren't huge, but the price, especially for the food, was great. The service was also very quick."
/user_details?userid=iF8oa1M5SGNU8Ai7RpUn5Q,Paul M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"When in Montreal on a budget, go to Crescent in Montreal downtown and you will find this restairant. Le Warehouse is a privately owned eatery only so far found in Montreal and Ottawa. Everyday and in any meal time, they offer $5.99 specials at least for the summers. Plenty of choices from soft shelled tacos to Mac & cheese with a twist. All simple dishes but presented well.In this sunny day, the lineups were plenty and their outdoor terrasse (partly located on both the sidewalk and road) were packed.They not only served your regular wine, spirits and beer ( though no Heineken or Corona), they also had their summer cocktails out including mihitos.A crowd pleaser at affordable price. $-$$"

All are solid choices and would get them again.The only item we tried that was not great was the nachos with cheese dip.Drinks are a bit pricier but original, i tried an upside down Corona and definitely a tasty treat.The inside is noisy and a bit rundown but it adds to the charm here"
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fish tacos were probably the best dish I got! Ordered the fish tacos, mac n cheese, burger and nachos. The fish tacos were crispy and juicy. The nachos were your standard nachos nothing can really go wrong there. Mac and cheese was yummy but more on the dry side. The burger was nothing special. Next time I would definitely want to try their onion rings and quesadilla ! Our server was very nice and attentive - she checked in with us a lot and made sure our water was always full. The lighting is terrible and I don't like sitting on stools but maybe sitting outside on the patio will be better next time !"

If you have primo real estate like this in Montreal,  serve half decent food and charge the heck out of the customer for the outdoor patio.  I did give the resto an extra star as the location enticed me on a hot summer night.  I ordered a famous Canadian Caesar - like an American Bloody Mary except with Clamato juice.  Only one problem - it lacked vodka!  Come on - this is Montreal - city of drunkards!  I did not order a Shirley Temple!  Then came the food.  My daughters Chicken tenders looked like Tyson's frozen tenders and tasted like cardboard breaded with encore du cardboard and then baked.Ok - here is my suggestion.  Stop at this place.  Enjoy a few Corona beers on the outdoor patio, enjoy the scene and eat elsewhere.  Don't worry, charging $5.95 for meals, the restaurant will be better off - resin prices are high these days."

They are all individual size but hey, they are only $5!Just be aware that whatever you want to add will be extra.. like mayo, bacon, or anything else... the server will be suggesting you to add more items to your burger but that's part of their job.Beers have regular prices but you still get a great deal with the food.I came back to this restaurant several times during my stay in Montreal... it is a pity you can't find it in the West side of Canada... hopefully they will come this way one day..."
/user_details?userid=GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"Food was really cheap, only $5 a dish, and that's Canadian dollars too! As an American, I was thriving. Food options were plentiful, I enjoyed my apple quinoa salad. I also liked the drink options. In terms of atmosphere, it felt very charged and uncomfortable.At some point, a bunch of men came into the establishment, whom I'm assuming worked here given that they went behind the counter. They came in carrying what appeared to be an inflatable sex doll. They were making obscene gestures to the doll behind the bar counter... in a restaurant? I understand that the place is 18+ probably because of the alcohol, but I didn't think that this indecency was part of the restaurant's business model. Maybe I'm just not as sexually liberated as the restaurant appears to be.A different waitress from the one that served us came to give us the bill. We were then asked to leave our table as soon as we paid the check. I understand that they're running a business and are trying to get as much revenue as possible within whatever timeframe they're working with, I'm also enslaved to capitalism, I get it. This waitress was getting our tip as well as kicking us out without serving us. It just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, especially after that delicious salad. This place is an experience, I'll say that."

Dropped by here randomly on a Monday night after another event nearby with some friends. We quickly got a table and proceeded to order $5 everything. I got the mac n cheese, and tried other people's food too, including the poutine and the roast beef.The mac and cheese, and the poutine were both decent and filling for the price. It's a young vibe with cool waiters and fun music and ambiance. I would definitely return here for some fun vibes and cheap eats if I was watching my wallet!"

If you're reaching the end of your paycheck and still can't do photosynthesis to feed yourself, well this is the place for you. For 4.95$, you can get a variety of different items from salads to burgers. The food is nothing spectacular, but is very decent considering the price. The burger comes with a side (soup, salad or fries) which makes it even better. The service was ok. The food came pretty quickly. Would be better if they warned us that the mayo was an extra 1$ before being surprised by the bill."

Ordered 4 plates of varieties - fish taco and spaghetti was legend.
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Great restaurant! Lots of good music and fun music videos on the screens. For 4.95$ each plate, I was very satisfied. I ordered the bacon potato skins and the mac and cheese.The potato skins were a really nice change from ordinary fries.However, I am very particular about mac and cheese. I have high standards. Sadly, this one did not meet them. The pasta wasn't the traditional mac and cheese pasta and the cheese had a sort of slightly spicy taste which ruined the actual cheese taste I wanted. It wasn't the worst I've had (See joe's panini mac and cheese) but it was disappointing. My boyfriend got the smoky burger and the beets and goat cheese salad. He really struck gold with the burger. It was so good!!! I'm going to have to go back just to order one for myself. I also really want to try the tacos. For now it's a four stars because of the mac and cheese. But it was really close to being a five. Visited on the 8th of December 2016"

I am not one to write yelp reviews bc i have better things to do but this place utterly pissed me off by how fuckin wack they were. Way to tamper with my montreal trip by having wack ass service.

If you don't get drinks or add ons, that is. Drinks are much pricier.Got the mushroom burger and it was on point. Patty was substantial, not overworked and juicy. Even comes with your choice of soup, fries, or salad, what a steal! Would probably come again!"
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,Ok so the food is cheap 5$ a plate but for 5$ you get a 5$ sized portion. The food was very good but it is all apetizer sizes. But 10$ for 2 portions of great food is a good deal so why am I complaining???They have anice selection of tap beer which is also reasonably priced. This is a low budget foid and drink place with a hip to hipster vibe. The only real downer is the fact there is a line to get in outside.A little load but a cool olce to meet some friends before going to a real bar.

/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"Finally got to try this place, and my feelings are similar to others': good value for the price, but food was not spectacular and the wait for the food was very long. I was there on a Friday night, so that might also explain it a bit, but we waited for more than 30 min. I got the Smokey BBQ burger which was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste anything spicy at all. It was still an enjoyable burger though, slightly better than one you would get on a rooftop BBQ, with a more crispy bun, slightly more tender beef and a lot of BBQ sauce. The fries that came with it were surprisingly good. Very crispy and consistent. I also had a margarita, which was ordinary, but they also have these special cocktails with a bottle of Corona reversed into it, which was neat. The flavour of the strong liquor was kind of faded by the Corona which I like. The price for the alcohol was cheap too, ranging from 5.5-12$. The inside was very packed and loud. We sat outside, which was enjoyable, but there were many people smoking in the vicinity, which really annoyed me. Overall, it was a good meal and it was amazing that 5$ could fill me up when I was dying of hunger. But personally, I would rather spend 10$ to get something tastier when I eat out."

The food was great and the ambiance was amazing, I then tried the one in Ottawa, in Toronto, and now finally this one. It's the same concept, the same awesome and delicious 4.95$ menu, the same after-ski ambiance, and the same amazing service. The food is always on point, the drinks are great and not watered down, the staff is energetic, and the ambiance is nice. Overall I recommend this place, now obviously it's not a place to invite someone on your first date, but it's a nice cheap place to hangout with friends."

However, with that being said, I will say that the food is nothing special. The only good things on their menu in my opinion would be their beef burgers and pasta options and even then - it's just ok. I've had their chicken fingers, calamari and tacos and they've all been pretty bland and just not worth the wait. Did I mention that the wait time to get your food is insanely long? For such simple menu options, it should be way faster."

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Warehouse is a fun, lively and budget friendly spot in the heart of downtown for casual drinks/food at great prices ! I came here at happy hour on a Thursday night with a friend, we were lucky to arrive just before the rush to be able to be seated right away because before long both floors were full (in and outside) and there was a lineup of people waiting to get in ! The décor inside is very casual and cozy but clean and not dingy.  Service was great, our waitress was sooooo nice and made sure to keep checking on us to make sure we were not kept waiting and that we had everything we needed at all times, and never made us feel rushed to turn the table. For drinks we had the Palomas. They were strong but in the right way  , they tasted great and refreshing. Foodwise, they have a menu of 5.99 items to choose from which is a fun touch. The food is basically bar food and the quality and portion size is actually pretty decent and for 5.99$ its a great deal. (let's keep in mind, Its 5.99, don't expect gourmet magic but its tasty and will hit the spot to accompany your drinks!) I had the Mac and Cheese with added Braised Beef (it was tasty and the plate was enough to be filling ...and believe me I can eat!), my friend had the queso dip with chips and she really enjoyed it as well. I would definitely recommend this place for a fun casual happy hour and food/snacks that also wont break the bank."

The atmosphere here is awesome with great tunes (hip hop and r&b) playing on their multiple TV screens. The bar is also decorated with Christmas lights! There's also attentive and social waiters/waitresses that work here. Great customer service overall.I highly recommend their ""Warehouse Crispy Mac N' Cheese"" with Braised Beef ($1.99 extra) dish and ""Union Street Noodle Salad"". All their snack plates are $4.95 plus tax! What a steal for quality food. Their portions are good but if you are very hungry I recommend ordering two dishes."

Something that you would never think of eating, but when you taste it it's amazing. The drink menu here is also very extensive and has a lot of quirky options, like the upside down corona margaritas. We ate there at around 10:30 PM on a Thursday and the place was packed. Has a trendy and dive bar vibe (in a good way)."

It was also quite loud so it was hard for us hear each other but it keep our moods bright!

Both times were right before the rush, so we were seated immediately but waited ages for our food since it got busy within minutes. The food menu is $4.95 which is a total steal for decent portions and a plethora of options. But that $4.95 quickly adds up with drinks, appetizers, dessert, and add ons. Let's talk food! The mac & cheese is maybe the best thing on the menu. It's cheesy with a kick and a crunch for good measure. They recommend adding meat, but I added garlic bread instead. I come from the land of ""Texas toast"" and I can say that this chunk of garlic bread was too legit. The tacos, burger, and grilled cheese were pretty good as well. The chicken strips + fries were the worst I've had, hence the 4 star rating. The onion rings and perogies are phenom, while the queso and potato skins are decent. Donuts for dessert are a must.Our waitress was the best part about this place and the reason why we came back a second time. And though she wasn't serving us the second time, she had complimentary donuts sent our way- so sweet! I could go on for ages, so just check it out for yourself."

BBQ chicken burger - really good BBQ sauce but the buns to meat ratio was off but I'm not complaining for that price Chicken wings - wet standard and delicious Perogies - are a very filling appetizer, they are really good and a nice surprise they were lightly deep fried Nachos - such a large portion they are very generous on the toppings Burger - was good and basic Union noodle salad - it was very nicely seasoned and delicious as well Braised beef spaghetti - was good but I didn't get much beef on mineFingers and fries - the chicken fingers were really good but the honey mustard sauce was the best part!

The menu is vast, including starters, salads, tacos, burgers, noodles and dessert.I wasn't super hungry but I felt compelled to try something since the price point was so low.The Union Street Noodle Salad came with chicken, spinach, avocado in a soy ginger dressing. Hot sauce (Frank's red hot) was a $1 extra. Interesting hot sauce choice for an Asian noodle salad but it still worked.The best choice though was ordering the Mini Donuts. It basically tasted like amazing churros with dulce de leche dipping sauce. Incredibly worth it and a great option to come to for booze and bites."

I had the asian noodle salad and my friend had the chicken wrap. The food is average, on the level you would expect from the price (except the donuts!) but it's a good alternative to fast food, much better than a McDonalds. We had an appointment at 7PM so we wanted something quick and easy to eat. We also had their ''beignets du facteur"" which are cinnamon sugar dusted mini donuts served with espresso toffee sauce. It was a good thing we only ordered one to share since they came with 9 of them! I didn't expect anything special about them but I was surprised at how good they were. Freshly made, they were hot and soft. We couldn't stop licking our fingers. :)The music was way too loud though, it's hard to talk, also they don't accept debit cards so make sure you have a credit card or cash."

My friend ordered the spaghetti with braised beef and fish tacos. Food doesn't taste that great but the restaurant was cozy when we went so not a bad experience.

The pasta is also good. The macaroni is dull and flavourless. Casual ambiance. Friendly service. Overall enjoyable experience every time. Be prepared to wait on Friday and Saturday nights.

The vibe was relaxed and the music was grooving. Food, a menu for  $4.99!They are some add on prices to certain dishes but I still found it pretty cheap. I ordered the works Burger which came with fries. I have no complaints about this place. Ordering a non alcoholic drink can pricey but it's all good. Great for students on a budget... a thumbs up!!"

It's in the perfect location for students too especially those who don't have too much to spend.FOOD: The food was good! Some burgers are better than others. I ordered the veggie burger once (which was not good) and a beef burger the next time (which was much better). The chicken wings were good but small and the calamari was ok. I would NOT recommend getting the chicken and fries appetizer because they are dry and lack flavor. Nor would I recommend the Asian salad (it tasted super bland). Overall, it was worth the price though.PRICE: Everything is priced at 5$ (except for drinks), need I say more? It's a great price especially for the portion you'll be getting.SERVICE: The servers are all quite friendly. Although getting the food took longer than usual, it wasn't too bad especially considering the amount of customers that they get and considering the fact that it is a two-story restaurant."

Out of all the places I went in Montreal over the weekend this was the most FUN. It was because you had a bunch of college kids all over the place so it was truly LIT!  Please do come here if you want to experience great food, or customer service. The drinks had absolutely NO alcohol in them what so ever. Not a drop. Now Canadians believe in tipping at least 15% or more however I am from the tri-state area  and if you don't give great service or exceed my expectations its safe to assume that you will be given nada. The only reason why this waitress got a tip is because I was going back to the states the next day and the banks were closed to exchange my money back. I ordered the chicken fingers w/ fries and a raspberry mojito. So disappointing the food was cold after waiting 45 minutes. Not including the 45 minutes I waited outside to be seated, in the cold.  Now everything on the menu is $4.95 unless you want to add extras , those prices vary. The music was good it was nothing up to date. It was all old early 2000's music. Which I didn't mind a little throwback jam session. I was just disappointed because I wanted to hear some Canadian jams. All in all I am looking forward to coming back here. It was a great way to end my vacation.Just be warned , the food isn't great , you'll see grown ass men dry humping each other .. and you'll need 3 drinks minimum to get tispy."

Service was very slow as it took almost 30 minutes to get our appetizers. But to be fair the waitress was very kind and helpful when explaining the menu. I had the fish tacos and I was disappointed in the tiny piece of fish that was in my taco. There was not much of a taste and I was only given three small tacos. But again to be fair, it is only $5 so I wasn't expecting a huge fish but I expected more than a bite size piece. I also had perogies and they were alright. My friend had a burger which she enjoyed. The peppered fries were amazing. The music was very very loud and we were shouting over each other. In a nutshell, I would skip the fish tacos and go for the burger and fries. Its a good spot for a quick bite with friends and it is very affordable."

The vibe at Le Warehouse was funky, but not over the top, as were the drinks. I drank a Red Eye Corona, followed by a Long Island Ice Tea because I was in the mood to have a good time, but also keep it classy. I must admit, the Red Eye Corona was a little too spicy for me, however, if you know what you're getting yourself into you will enjoy it. They offer two floors of seating, as well as outdoor seating which I recommend if the weather permits. The food is cheap, all around $5. Drinks are a bit pricier, around $7-12 dollars. I recommend Le Warehouse to those who want a fun and lively bar experience. I've heard this bar can get a line of people waiting to get in, but when I went it was relatively full, but I didn't have to wait. This isn't the most exciting bar in the world, but it definitely showed me a good time."

The place is popular spot for college students and especially people on a budget as everything on menu was under 5 buck, there were extra charges for other things but unneeded.

/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I tried. Still a no. Walked in and was looking for staff, absolutely no one seemed engaged. All the staff are clearly very close, which makes for a good atmosphere and teamwork, however they often seem a little distracted from their paying customers. Sat ourselves at the bar, went and got our own menus, waited to be served. Asked how long it takes for most food orders at this hour since we knew we were in a relative rush (1 hour) and were told 15-20 minutes. Needless to say that wasn't the case. We were the 3rd and 4th people to be seated at the bar. The 5th person to sit was served before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get a drink in front of you when you sit at the bar. Something has to be up with their kegs because I had had a Shocktop earlier that day yet the one that was served to me tasted off, almost soapy, and with an unpleasant aftertaste. In the screens around the bar, sports replays? Silent music videos from the 90s? Nope. Just a pixelated version of their insignia. Is your beer empty? Even at the bar you still needed to flag someone down for a refill if you're lucky enough that they can be bothered, and this is with less than 10 people being served... 35 minuted of waiting, one empty beer glass waiting, one near full beer sitting gross and unwanted, and no food. Finally! Food! Wait... F***.Fish tacos come missing the sauces and toppings, sent it back only for the same plate to be returned accompanied with the words ""they were out of _____"". Its 5pm on a Thursday and you guys don't have things from sauce to cilantro? Oh here's your burger *spills fries on the bar*. Guy beside us who ordered leaves after 30 minutes, having ordered a salad presuming the simplicity would mean he would actually get it in time to eat. He asks to cancel it as he's waited too long. The bartender not only couldn't give two f*** but also gave the guy attitude about it. Zero customer service or etiquette. Fish tacos: flavorless. Fries that don't even reach the level of being warm, watery mac n cheese. ""Premium Alberta beef"" that I'm near certain came as frozen patties. Again, flavorless burger. Split the patty open and it's 100% the grooves from when it was ground. This means they added absolutely nothing to meat since the slaughterhouse. The beer glass is still empty. Potato skins dry and overlooked. When asking for our bill we were given a half apology for the longer food wait, but I wouldn't count it as a real apology as the bartender completely ignored us when we said the food belonged in the trash. My companion made it very clear upon payment that this was a complete waste of time and money, so as last time we were offered shots. Seems to be about the only thing this place has to offer is shots because everything else I've tasted from cocktails to beers to food has been terrible. One bad experience can be overcome. A second terrible one with bad service means you won't see me here again. I've been to a number of these ""$5 meal"" concept restaurants but this one has been by far the worst."

Located within walking distance of many schools, it's the perfect place to get a cheep but delicious lunch. I don't know why anyone would possibly complain about the food here considering the price. I ordered the Végé burger that came with fries and some potato skins as an entree. The potato skins could have been either cut thinner or cooked longer to be more crispy but really for the price I'm not complaining. The veggie burger was delicious and the fries were yummy. We sat outside on the terrace so I can't say anything about the decor inside. The waitress was pretty aggressive about us seating ourselves instead of waiting for someone to come outside even though there were a ton of seats available. She kind of had a tick on her shoulder for the rest of our stay but we kind of laughed it off. The food came quick and we were able to flag down other staff to get what we wanted since our waitress disappeared. But for 5$ I'd definitely come back to this place."

Because of their ""$4,95 per items"" concept,  I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical and had decided to try it on different occasions before writing a review...I have tried their evening service (at the bar) and with my coworkers during lunchtime (we were seated at the terrace). The atmosphere was great, during the evening it is more of a bar with a bit of loud music and during the afternoon it was way more relaxed. Regarding the food, I tried their wings, doughnuts, apple pie, sweet potatoes fries and one of their hamburgers... I've also tried their drink of the month.... The food is not extravagant but the portions are good for the amount you pay. Le Warehouse is more of a place to ""chill"" with friends in the heart of downtown rather than a five-star restaurant, however, surprisingly I really like it there and will be going back in the near future."

The first time I was there, I had the Mac and cheese which tasted fake. I also had the fish tacos which were good but was a tiny portion.The second time I was there, I had the grilled cheese which was undoubtedly the best thing I tried. My boyfriend had the chicken fingers and fries and found them to be very good. The only problem was that he asked for a bbq sauce instead of honey mustard and was then charged a dollar extra without being notified.While the food was mediocre-good, the service was absolutely awful. The waitress was rude, inattentive and didn't check in on us after we got our meals. The food took over 45 minutes to get to us, which is pretty ridiculous considering it was not busy at all in there.The last negative was the water.

That is until today. I had the worst experience ever. We were sat at a table when someone brought 5 waters for the table and then walked away without even saying hi or asking if we would like any drinks to start. 15 minutes later a different server showed up and asked how we were doing and we finally got to order our drinks which took another 15 minutes to get. Then once he finally took our order 20 minutes after receiving and finishing our drinks he didn't even bother to ask if we wanted refills. Next thing we know it's 45 minutes after we've order and our waiter and food is nowhere to be found. I tried calling over any server I could and they'd look me dead in the eye and walk away. Finally once our server was spotted it was brought up he goes ""ya the kitchens really slow today it happens sometimes I'll go check on the food"" it finally comes out and a plates missing. 15 mins of waiting and it still hasn't showed up so we ask someone about it and her response is ""oh ya I'm pretty sure it's sitting in the back"" leading us to believe it's been sitting for god knows how long to get cold and not fresh. We got our bills and got out as fast as possible. Most of the food was cold. Not once did we see a manager of some sort come rectify the situation and do something about clearly very unhappy customers. The servers clearly have no experience in giving a proper start to finish service and are too busy talking with each other the majority of the time to even notice if a customer needs something.

Awesome, and right now they're doing a promotion on their coasters where to can win a pint glass. I got two coasters and won a glass off one. My friend got the Mac and cheese, which was absolutely delicious. She was disappointed they had run out of boxes, because she couldn't take her left overs home.

Also no debit is accepted method of payment is either cash or credit. There is an ATM but the fees are $3.00""Should I go here?""If you are broke, hungry or bored this is a really awesome place to eat!"

The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Places were not bad at all the concept of everything being five dollars it was interesting but it definitely showed in the quality of their burgers. I'd recommend it but I would not recommend getting any hamburger."
/user_details?userid=vke1bw_U8-bqAFgP8cViPg,Steven H.,"Brossard, Canada",1 star rating,"After waiting outside to be seated, we ordered drinks which came in a reasonable amount of time. Half an hour after ordering our food we asked our waitress what's going on and she said that the kitchen was backed up because the restaurant was full. It was only about half full. 20 minutes later I told the waitress we're paying for our drinks and leaving. Oddly enough she had no issue with this (I guess this is a regular thing) and as I'm paying she said ""Well, there is a 30-45 min normal wait for food."" During the whole time waiting she did not come to check on us, refill our drinks, or anything else. This is a restaurant to avoid if you want to eat food."
/user_details?userid=x9C39kkef3kDKISrLNpYnA,Jessica L.,"Concord, NC",1 star rating,"I literally made a yelp account so I could review this 'restaurant' because of how awful it is. I wish I could give this restaurant less than one star it was so terribly. The meal started out rough by taking TWENTY minutes for our unobservant waitress to greet us. She also never actually greeted us, just asked if we were ready (which of course we were we've been sitting here with no drinks in the sun for twenty minutes pal). If you thought twenty minutes was long ooooo just wait. It took AN HOUR AND A HALF for our food to get to us. We have literally been sitting for two hours with absolutely no food. When the food did come, it looked appealing, but was cold and flavorless. And to top it all off, the order was wrong. I asked the waitress where our queso was (which was supposed to be a quick appetizer because we were hungry) and the waitress forgot to put it in. So she told us she would get it out as quick as possible. So after we sit with our food finished I asked her how long it would be and she replied that she did not know.. it could be 5 minutes or 20. So I told her to bring the check and not worry about it. I wasn't waiting another hour.THEN after waiting even longer for our checks to be collected, our queso walks out  the waitress came over to take the bills and I asked her if we could just get a box for the queso. She said yes, but she would need to take the checks back so she can charge me.I kept my cool but I was raging on the inside. No way am I going to pay for a queso that YOU forgot to ring in and that I waited a little over TWO HOURS for. This was the absolute worst dining experience I've ever had and I would discourage anyone from going here. You would be better off not eating or going to McDonald's. I went in having a great day and left seething in anger"

The food seemed to lack in flavor. Not sure if I would return, it is very busy and a long wait so be prepared. But definitely is the most reasonable place in the area. The patio seating was nice and you have a nice view."

Astounded by the price, I went here multiple times and tried out different dishes to see which one is good and which one is bad. So far, I have only had the best fish tacos and other amazing dishes.Don't be fooled by the price, yes you can get quality delicious food for just $5.I like some of their cocktails as well, the bulldog and the pink lemonade is my favorite. Naturally their drinks are expensive as they have to make up somewhere for the profits. The burgers are good, quesadillas are a good appetizer (portions are small though), nothing beats their chicken fingers and beer.I also enjoyed their sun dried pasta (you got to add extra bacon ofcourse) very much. This is one place I religiously go to irrespective of the line up - totally worth it. The staff are extremely friendly and i love how they have named their card machines after celebs.Highly recommend this place. Starve yourself and go here cause you can never have enough $5 fish tacos!"

A group of snowboarders wanted to make a place that has good food for the staff who worked on the mountain and keep it at reasonable prices. Years later the concept stuck and now they are in Montreal and it rules!! Since everything on the menu is $4.95 it allows you to think with your stomach instead of your wallet, I always go for the French Dip because the Au Jus is so good. Here's a tip, get it with the onion rings because they finish it with a honey drizzle..fer shizzle! Also get a side of fish tacos they won't disappoint \m/"

Food was decent especially for the price but having to wait an hour for my drink and an hour and a half for my food with no return by our waitress and no acknowledgement of our empty glasses while we waited for our meals this place is not worth the cheap price.

Yummy & worth the money!!Will definitely be coming back here!"
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I can't believe the food is only $5 per order! The burgers were so tasty; warm crispy buns and just enough zing to them. If you like spicy flavours, the bbq burger is great. The mushroom burger was also flavorful but not as exciting (it reminded me a little bit of a Big Mac). The baja fish tacos were not so great, I wouldn't bother with them next time. I loved the fact that the burger came with a little salad. If you are on a budget, beware of the add-ons, cuz the waitresses just slip it in as a casual question and before you know it, you could end up with many more $1+ items than you wanted. The service is slow, but friendly. I liked that the big screen TVs all over the restaurant.  The seating is not ideal because you might be seated on a wooden block with  nowhere to hang your coat or your purse. Great place to hang out with friends, but it is pretty loud. Would I come back? For sure! Maybe not on a busy night when the line is long, but I would be happy to wait 10-15 minutes for a nice meal at a very decent price."
