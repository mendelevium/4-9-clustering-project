/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was a rainy Tuesday. We were cold. We were tired. We were hungry. We wanted chicken. And there it was, a brief distance from Concordia - a giant sign that read, ""JERK CHICKEN"". Our eyes locked and we knew - this was the place. That said, this place went above and beyond our Caribbean food expectations. The jerk chicken platter was served with chicken, rice, coleslaw, and plantains. Everything was scrumptious. Especially the plantains. And the chicken. And the coleslaw. And the staff. Just kidding. But everyone was genuinely very friendly(!!) Enjoy!!"
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I was excited and had high expectations for this place after reading an article on the web. It was disappointing! I ordered 3 beef patties and a jerk chicken leg. The girl at the counter was nice but I had to ask her for the hot sauce for the patties. She had packed just one prolly for the leg only. I feel like the leg was not juicy enough and lacked the jerk flavor for sure..I'm used to another place that is so flavorful but it's a bit far. I guess I will have to keep driving more to go there over this one(eyes rolling)! Let's talk about the patties- I took a picture to show u that it doesn't look like there's ground beef..maybe some.bean paste or like really really less beef and more of the other filling they use with the beef. I wanted to taste beef in the dam beef patties but u can't! Try one and u will see what I'm on about!!! Oh! And it's $3 for each and the leg was $5.50 I guess. The only thing good was the hot sauce..it's dynamite! So this place is definitely a SKIP!

This time around I was excited to try the resto for an after work gathering. Conveniently located on Crescent St., the resto is hard to spot at first as it's located on a second level. The decor inside is beautiful and very inviting. There was a DJ spinning very loud music to the point we couldn't enjoy a conversation - but the plus side being old school jams are fun to listen to during a meal. (The DJ was only in for this evening). We wanted to sit outside originally on their terasse, but one of their umbrellas weren't working. The menu was clean and simple. That evening they also introduced a new bar food menu that looked pretty good- so I settled to order the tasting platter for 2 ppl for 20$. This platter included mini grilled cheese bites, plantains, Mac and cheese balls, chicken wings. After being served the sharing platter, I was a bit disappointed to learn that they didn't have the mini grill cheese bites. If I had known I would have opted for something else. The presentation was ok, flavorwise the chicken wings were the best out of the platter. I was still hungry so I ordered the small side version of the mac and cheese pie, it was ok. Cocktails were alright. I wanted the honeydew one originally but they didn't have the ingredients to make it. Maybe it was by chance I came on the day where they were missing everything I ordered. My colleagues were fairly pleased with their meals. For now I'll stick to enjoying their Jamaican patties from Adonis vs In house dining."
/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,Fun little resto on Crescent street downtown. Great beats playing which makes the time you are there all the more enjoyable. Â The food is really good and prices are reasonable. They ask what level of spice you want so those who are not used to jerk chicken can start easy and work their way up each time they come back. Highly recommend for a quick lunch stop.
/user_details?userid=c-dchuYjRCwJVstIE5KnMQ,Mary V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My brother chose to have lunch at Lloydie's on a Saturday afternoon, it's been bookmarked so I was looking forward to trying the food. Upon arrival, I was first so I looked around and snapped some photos for Yelp of course. There were 3 other people each eating alone. No one greeted me or asked if I needed anything. The music was old school so I was pleased, although the speakers were quite loud. The decor is homey with Caribbean memorabilia throughout the restaurant. There is a section above the kitchen displaying posters of Rihanna, saying these people eat for free. Once my brother arrived, we noticed the menu on top of the cash area and made our way to see what to order. He opted for the oxtail with rice, plantains and side of coleslaw. I was not extremely hungry so chose the mac pie, beef patty and side of chick peas since they were out of greens. He took a sorrel which he prefers during the summertime but wanted it. Sorrel Drink is a dark red, a little sour, made from the petals of sorrel plant or hibiscus plant flower. I chose a carbonated grapefruit drink called Ting, which was full of flavor. The food arrived shortly and we dug in. My brother loved his dish and I tried some oxtail and plantains. It was moist and tender, very good. I did not enjoy the mac pie, too dry for me and not much flavor. The party tasted like any other I've had and I was not into the chick peas. The total cost was almost $40, not including tip. Next time I'll try one of the main dishes."

/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was at Lloydies on a rainy late weekday night, after an event I attended in the area. The outside first caught my eye, then when I looked inside, I thought why not?The decor of Lloydie's is really original, it takes you to the West Indies. I ordered a vegan plate, which consisted of plantains, rice, mango salad and peas as well as a Ting soda. I loved it, the food was really good!Lloydie's is not too extravagant, not expensive, you are served with a smile and the atmosphere is nice ... I will return with my friends very soon for sure."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant is a joy as soon as you walk in!The interior was SO good, with so many cool details (peek the ""Gyal a ring off mi cellie"" next to the wall phone) - we were swooned right away. Not to mention the adorable rum bar!! The music was on point, there were beautiful colors and the food smelled wonderful... We ordered oxtail and jerk chicken to go, and a bottle of Peardrax. The food came fairly quickly and the portions were generous. Each meat portion came with coleslaw, plantain and rice and peas. It was delicious! The plantain was crispy on the outside, but sweet and tender inside. The rice and peas was full of flavor, having absorbed juices from the meat. The oxtail was generously coated in sauce, and the meat was more than tender. The jerk was tasty and nicely grilled. I personally didn't care much for the coleslaw - I thought it was a bit bland, even though the use of coconut milk was nice. So happy about Lloydie's! I hope more people get to discover quality Caribbean cuisine!PS. Peardrax is so good!!"

/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband and I had lunch at Lloydies and it was fantastic!Hubby wasn't too hungry, so he just ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($7). I got the Jerk Chicken Platter ($12) but ended up sharing most with the hubster, lol. The Jerk Chicken Platter was a good size. I got a drumstick and a thigh (and they were a normal size, not puny like at some places), a large serving of rice and peas, 4 thick pieces of plantains, and a small cup of cucumber salad. The spice level was pretty mild, but they do have hot sauces for you if you want to kick it up a notch. The chicken was tender and flavourful. The rice could have been a bit hotter in temperature, but it was still good. I loved the sweet and soft plantains. The cucumber salad was a bit watery and had too much onions for my tastes, but I still thought it was ok. It had bell peppers and carrots in it too. I could see it cutting the heat if you overdo it with the hot sauce, haha. I had a bite of my husband's sandwich and it had jerk chicken in it, some cucumbers (I think from the salad) and some hot sauce drizzled over the meat (he asked for it hot). It was tasty and the bread they used was a bit sweet which complimented the spiciness well. So you order and pay at the cash register. Then they give you a number on a stand that you place at your table. They bring you your food when it's ready.They are licensed and sell beers and cocktails. They also had some cool non-alcoholic drinks like sorrel, ginger beer and some other ones. If you just want to drink water they have a dispenser with glasses where you can help yourself. The space is large and clean looking. Service was really friendly and nice. The washroom (a single person gender-neutral room) has a picture of palm leaves and the sky on the ceiling and there's a speaker that plays ""beach sounds."" So if you're on the toilet and looking up, it kinda feels like you're sitting on the beach, (?) weird, but cool, lol. Lloydies is a neat Jamaican restaurant with good food at reasonable prices. I would go back :)"

Super tasty and tender. My jeans are tight but these are definitely worth every single bite. The patty's are nothing impressive, I think I may have had better elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"They opened a Loydie's next to Concordia! I can get macaroni pie literally whenever I want (I'm either at home or at school 24/7). However, when I visited and ordered the macaroni pie, it tasted a little bit off, so St-Viateur wins the macaroni pie taste test.This location looks a lot better though (Sorry St-Viateur). It's bigger and the seating is more comfortable, the theme is set in (patty tables and neon!) and the little terrace is the cutest. Service is good, the people are very friendly.The true battle for me now is if I get a patty here or at Coco bun....."
/user_details?userid=9Zu4BPDntg_52YmNwViyOA,Daron D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",5 star rating,"Another one of my great meals I had in Montreal. Came here on a Tuesday evening and wasn't packed at all in here. You walk up and order the food, then sit down as they bring it out to you. I had started with a beef patty. It was excellent, it had the spice, the taste, and the like butter flaky of the crust. I also had a drink. It was a rum runner but they had like three different types. It was very good, a lot of ice and not strong (at least to me). For my food, jerk chicken was the word. I had the leg/thigh piece, which was excellent and some really good chicken and only was $5 I believe. I also end up ordering some jerk chicken poutine. Greatness is the word that comes to mind. I had a lot of poutine while in Montreal (and still places left to try), this was the best poutine I had. Everything on it taste great (gravy, fries, cheese curds, jerk sauce and chicken). I also had a bite of their jerk pork and I found that to be very very good. Overall this is another one of those must go to places in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came across this place while walking around Crescent, and I'm so glad I did. This Caribbean spot has a great vibe and the cutest place palm tree theme decor! My partner and I decided to share the jerk chicken plate and jerk chicken poutine with a banana soda - and they did not disappoint! The jerk chicken plate came with 2 pieces of chicken, rice with beans, plantain and a side of coleslaw, while the poutine consisted of fries, cheese, jerk chicken with their homemade gravy. Both dishes came in good portions, and had tons of flavour! The chicken was so soft, tender and flavourful; the plantain was soft and sweet; the coleslaw was a great palate cleanser and the gravy enhanced that jerk chicken flavour! The elements of the dish all complemented each other, making the plates very enjoyable to eat. If you're not familiar with Caribbean soda, I also recommend trying the banana or kola champagne sodas! To top it off, the service was absolutely great! The worker was very welcoming and helpful, making the experience of eating there even better. Overall, Lloydie's has good food, affordable prices, a great staff and a good vibe! It's definitely a place to try, especially if you want Caribbean food."

I went to the one on crescent with my friends and we decided to order a bunch of things so we can try them all out!We ordered the jerk chicken plate, the jerk pork plate, their plantain poutine( soooo good) and their macaroni pie. Their jerk pork plate was my favourite, the meat was so tender and cooked to perfectionService was GREAT the staff was very helpful, funny and knowledgeable. Menu was really simple, they even have vegetarian options. Everything was so good we devoured our little Caribbean feast in 5 mins. Definitely going back there very soon!!!"

I give it 3 stars only because it was a cozy place, and something different to try. I was not a fan of the poutine. My father had the ox tail sandwich and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't out of this world. The seasoning was definitely too strong for our stomach."
/user_details?userid=YJhUmUIvCm_GNYXjz3bL_Q,Elliot P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Stopped in after a day at Musee des Beaux Arts. Two patties one chicken one beef and our bellies were filled. Sorrel to wash it down and we were satisfied.

/user_details?userid=NP5FB7YPXCGmh-yY7ePXqg,William A.,"Unionville, Markham, Canada",5 star rating,We had the jerk chicken plate and the ox tail plate and both were delicious but the ox tail was special. The place is nice and clean with large trendy communal tables or smaller ones if you want privacy. We are from Toronto and will definitely return before heading back.
