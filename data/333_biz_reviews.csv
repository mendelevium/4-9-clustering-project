/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered the Pad Thai for delivery via UberEats. The meal came quickly and was exactly as I expected. The portion is generous and filling, and comes with vegan shrimp, vegan chicken, fried tofu, and ground peanuts. ChuChai has an extensive menu with a wide array of mock meats and seafood, noodle dishes, appetizers, etc. Although everything is vegan, it's still hearty, delicious, and authentic Thai food - none of that kale and avocado BS. I highly recommend this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=lGBUwmZTRAesgB8BcGNPHQ,Victoria C.,"Baltimore, MD",5 star rating,"Vegan in Montreal: a must visit for any veg fans in Montreal, and everyone else too! //The food here is absolutely amazing, and a really special treat with some unique options for those focusing on the vegan side of life. I went with a non-veggie person and we both enjoyed our meal so much. I friend insisted we try the ""duck""...  and they were right! We added dumplings, imperial rolls, and ""shrimp"" and each dish was excellent. Overall can't recommend enough."
/user_details?userid=fdOuKZghNqoaA-Z8kn7_qQ,Jamie Y.,"Irving, TX",4 star rating,"First of all, I did not realize that this restaurant only served vegan food until I got the menu. Although I am not a vegan, it did not stop me from ordering their food. We ordered spring roll, pad thai, which has vegan shrimp and vegan chicken and panang curry with vegan beef. I was really curious about vegan shrimp. The flavor of the dishes were pretty good, but I've had better Thai food before. The texture of vegan shrimp was interesting since I've never encountered them before. I think they did a good job at creating vegan versions those shrimp and meat. We sat out on the patio... it was just nice to be out in nice weather, eating good food. Food 3/5 but overall experience 4/5."

We do have a few favorite dishes on the menu that is a must every time that we go like the fried seaweed, the papaya salad, the boeuf 3 sauce and the tofu with fried spinach and peanut sauce. I have brought a lot of people that weren't vegetarian to this restaurant and everyone was always super happy with the food. Great place for vegan, vegetarians or omnivores."
/user_details?userid=Zfj1fLiPeqAtjQVJRTfpZQ,Vinh N.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,Another interesting vegetarian Asian fine dining restaurant that I see pop up in trendy areas all around the world. My family were the only Asian family that night so it was telling who the restaurant caters to. The food is hit or miss and like most of these types of places focus on imitating meat. Portions were generally small. One thing I did like was that you don't get the pungent smell and taste of fish sauce that is so heavily used in Thai cuisine. Some of the dishes like the rice and pad thai were overly sweet though without that saltiness mask. The crispy duck matched the texture of the meat and fat without the accompanying fatty taste and was done better than many other places. The dumplings in peanut sauce were just too sweet. Everything else was comparable to the cheaper mom & pop vegetarian places around the world.

Great portions and service, the cocktails are great here especially matched with their spicy meals. I like to go here late nights because it gets crowded at early dinner time.  I often get the tofu drunken noodle (pad Thai) and it never disappoints!!"
/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went here for a family dinner on a cold night. One half of the place is reserved for the restaurant and the other half is reserved for the bar. Didn't really know what to expect since everything was vegan and it took a while for me to choose what I wanted off the menu. Our table ended up ordering a bunch of different things to share which was a good way to taste a little bit of everything. My favourites were the 3 flavours vegan beef, the crispy vegan duck and the fried rice. The sauces on these dishes were EXCELLENT and really brought it all together.Overall this place exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed my food."
/user_details?userid=dHLmDXwP2-ckmpyt79Yheg,Stefan K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Finding good vegan asian cuisine is usually a challenge for me. Thank goodness for this Montreal gem. ChuChai offers some of the tastiest meals I've ever enjoyed. The meals feel very upscale in their offering, presentation and portion sizes. We decided on 3 meals to share and found that it was enough for our appetites. The first dish we tried was the Pad Thai with duck. The Pad Thai did not disappoint and although I was discouraged by no offering of vegan shrimp with the dish the duck also did not disappoint. It was delicious and eerily reminiscent of real duck. I was impressed with the skill in the preparation and the taste. The second dish was the Chicken Chili and Basil. It was a succulent dish and the basil was very flavourful adding to the dishes overall enjoyment and appeal. Again the preparation of the chicken was good enough to fool even the most hard core of carnivores. There were many times I was questioning if we were indeed eating vegan meat.The last dish we got was the Duck with Soya and Spinach. This was my favourite of the night. The duck was crispy, sticky, tender and slippery. The sauce and glaze just added to the potency of the flavour experience. I could not get enough of it and my taste buds wanted to override my stomach capacity it was that good.I don't think that there is a menu item that you can go wrong with here. My only piece of advice is that all items on the menu come as described so if you want a rice or noodle dish to pair with it make sure you order that as well."

I crave to eat here.Being a Vegetarian, I adored the concept of Vegan meat that they are trying to simulate. Mind blowing food.Pick any dish from the menu, no risk!!!Not to be missed ones are: Crispy Seaweed, Panang Beef Curry, Crispy Duck, Pad kee MaoAt times we take their 50 $ tasting menu, which is awesome.None of the Thai Restaurants around the world can beat its flavourful food!!! Every dish is a delicacy and with your first bite, there would be explosion of flavours, perfectly blended.... Every item is better than the other.. Gosh! This place turns me on!! Heavenly food, their servers are smart and hospitality is best in Montreal. Location St. Dennis again great! But parking would be a fight, do make a reservation, its always full; even on weekdays. Best for special occasions.. Bit expensive but worth it. Must go and try. No trip to Montreal for me is complete without a visit to Chu Chai."

I have been here probably over a 100 times and have never been disappointed. It is a fine dine restaurant and it is vegan. I have brought friends here who are hardcore non-vegetarians and they have had a hard time believing what they ate was not meat.I have tried probably everything on their menu like especially like cripsy seaweed, crispy duck with spinach, Panang beef curry, Pad kee mow, crispy rice.If you're a foodie (like me) this is one place you can't afford to miss. You can thank me later and I do accept cheques (or you can just like my post if you agree afterwards) :)"

Surprised and delighted to enjoy the several dishes we ordered. What could have been better was the environment, but you cannot choose who you sit next to at the restaurant. Overall, besides that, I have to give it 5 stars. I just cannot believe how these dishes were so rich in flavors."

/user_details?userid=rfLm7urBqAPYfr1WYofs1A,Vanessa P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First thing: Im not veganSo when a starving meat lover needs food, it better be good and filling so this place blew my mind. A couple of my friends are vegan - you know, the cool kind who dont bust meat lover's chops ... so I trusted them when they said this place was great. Im really open to trying vegan restos. I love trying new things.I got chicken pad thai and I could hardly taste the difference between real chicken and chicken flavoured tofu.  I was so impressed!!! I was expecting something with a not so usual but tolerable after taste but it wasnt the case ( that probrably doesnt even make sense but wtv ). It was tasty and bursting with flavour Its definitely a good place for a Vegan to bring non vegan friends and everyone is happy. Vegans get to do their vegan thing and meat lovers will feel completely satisfied. I would definitely come back here!"

They punish you if you come with a lager group .They forced you to order from a different menu that costed more and has a lot less to chose from , when I asked for a different menu they told me they could not do it out of laziness it's to much work for the  . Second time my friend really interested on trying it again just the 2 of us . The menu was a lot better more to choose from and better choices and priced food. First time here I took the Famous fake Duck plate YUK! Second time I had this fresh pita like thing friend recommended it was amazing . Then ordered the fake shrimp plate which was also really good . Original I was going to give this place 2 stars having more better choice for better price turned it to 4."

Ive had better pad thai and red curry, even vegetarian versions. The service was a bit disappointing, not that the servers were bad but they seemed understaffed. Also received my cocktails towards the mid/end of the meal, probably because of the same."

I have to agree that for a vegetarian restaurant, it tasted pretty good. It's totally different from the typical vegetarian restaurant that we have in mind. It's flavourful!

The service was good and the food was un. Believable. SO. GOOD!! I got a dish with vegan duck and I swear if someone would of told me it's real duck I would of believed them. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I highly recommend this place for vegans and non-vegans, I think anyone would love it."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"First off- the food was awesome. We ordered the crispy duck and the sweet and sour fennel salad with crispy chicken. Both were incredibly tasty and I'm not even typically fond of mock meats. In that sense I'd pick ChuChai over Yuan any day.The stinker with this place is that the service was seriously compromised. To be fair, we made our reservation super last minute for the end of service on a Friday night. When we arrived the host was wringing his hands telling us that a group of 30 was about to arrive. Oh boy. Service was super sporadic throughout the evening and we never received one of our plates. When we mentioned it to the server they weren't particularly phased and began to slam the kitchen staff. We were hoping to order another round of drinks, maybe even a coffee, but were very quickly ushered out once our dessert plate was cleared.We walked away from ChuChai still kinda hungry. I don't know if that's a attributable to the food or just the fact that we didn't get a third of what we ordered. I'd maybe venture back on a quiet night."
/user_details?userid=tAtblebDRTiB9TkAxupncQ,Ivan M.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"ChuChai is my go-to vegetarian place to take non-vegetarians, and my favourite restaurant in Montreal at this point.Honestly, I've taken, at last count, 12 non-veg guests there, and every single person has loved it.Their prices are on the upper end of causal dining, a three person outing is likely going to come in ~$100, more with drinks.Almost everything on the menu is great, but the favourites seem to be the faux crispy duck, the panaag curry, the crispy spinach and the sticky rice.I've never tired their desert offerings, however, as at the overall price of the meal there is usually a better offering elsewhere on St.Denis for desert, at a more friendly price point.Definitely call in advance and reserve a table or you might be out of luck."
/user_details?userid=ROb9Of0bCeiUdm_36FDMMw,Emily M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Pretty tasty vegan Thai food but overpriced for the quality. I don't feel like there's much craftsmanship to the food here, at least not enough to justify the hype. I enjoyed most of what I tried but wasn't blown away.To start, the tom yum was yummy but the chicken satay was small and too sweet for my taste. The pad Thai was good, with the massaman curry being the unanimous favorite. My biggest complaint: I hate having to pay extra for rice when the dish is already expensive - of course I want rice with my curry?I expect restaurants at this price point to veer away from such faux meat-heavy dishes as it feels like a cheap cop out, but I'm sure others feel differently. To be fair, my partner loved everything we ate - but this isn't their review.One funny thing to note: We chose to eat on the edge of the covered terrace even though it looked like rain. When the host sat us, she warned us she couldn't guarantee a table inside - even though it was 100% empty at the time. Kinda strange but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  everything turned out fine."
/user_details?userid=1XC6P09iHHKNvVI99bq2rg,Audrey C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"First of all I wish to say that ChuChai is strictly vegan.I had supper there. The food and service are very good although the vegan meat does not taste like meat at all. The sauces are great and so are the desserts. I did find it a little pricey though. $50 per person with 1 glass of wine, appetizer, meal, rice and dessert."
/user_details?userid=YmTe4zuKvbsJ249bHhu0Sw,Frank D.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,Everyone orders the duck but they're right. It's amazing. And yet the spicy basil chicken is probably better. My favorite Montreal vegetarian place.

I had been here before, a good 8 years ago and the menu was relatively the same. They are all Asian based dishes. The spice star level indicated on the menu isn't really reliable. I had a 1 star spicy dish and it wasn't even spicy. My husband tried the spiciest item on the menu: Vietnamese salad at 3 stars. It was medium spicy.For the dish you get, it's expensive. I had the `beef with bell pepper` for $19. There was maybe 1/4 of a bell pepper with about a dozen mini mini meat balls slathered in a sticky and overbearingly sweet sauce. It's a pain that the rice costs extra so it can absorb all that sugar.At least my Thaijito was good..."
/user_details?userid=bBd8sOgkhbaEeZHjczV8ZQ,Erin M.,"Durham, NC",4 star rating,"Everything is easy at ChuChai because it's all vegan. I started with the Tom Kha soup with vegetables; it was just the right spice level and warm and comforting. Next, I split the mango, green apple and cashew salad with a friend. Served on a bed of greens, it was pretty tasty. Lastly, the pad Thai was good, but I'm generally a bit underwhelmed by mock meat. Next time, I'd order it with tofu only and skip out on the mock chicken and shrimp. The restaurant itself is very nice, casual but beautiful and has fantastic service."

I was extremely surprise that their wh0leMenu is vegan and i was happy to taste the mushroom appetizer that taste so good i thought it was meat at first but i was told it was mushroom and it was absolutely delicious!! I tried the tofu with peanut sauce and fried spinach and the green curry veggies with coconut milk and it was so good with the side of brown rice and the coconut shred appetizer was served in a little leafy if was the perfect salty sweet balance i just love this place will be back!

Before seating us, the host decided to take a lengthy phone call. After he hung up, he told us we could eat there if we were out within an hour and a half because we didn't have reservations (fine with me).  It took half an hour before the same person took our drink order because the other servers just ignored us. We decided to leave after being rudely told that no, the expensive curry does not come with any rice. I have no problem paying more for fine food. After all, it's an experience. But there is no excuse for that level of rudeness.Perhaps we just came on an ""off"" night, or perhaps the 5 star reviews of this place were written by employees."

I really was amazed at the duck like texture, crispy chewy with a little effort needed for gamey meat.   If I lived in Montreal this would become one of our favorite go to places.  This not a specialty restaurant but it should be valued as an upscale foodie spot that is worth the uber money to get her. If your coming from old town.. take another uber up to the nearby outdoor market on your first days visit to the city and you'll set the bar high for the rest of your visit!"

The rice portions are kinda small.. we should have ordered 3 rice orders for the 2 of us.. will do so next time!The mango sticky rice dessert is impeccable.

So off to yelp I go!THere were 4 of us and we made reservations.  Although we were seated at our reservation time, we waited about 30 minutes to put our order in (during which time no one greeted or acknowleged us to let us know they would be with us).  After our order was taken, we did receive our food within a reasonable amount of time, however no one came by even once to check on us or see if we wanted more drinks or anything else to eat (which we would have ordered both of).  I tried to flag one of the staff down several times and was ignored.  We finished our meal and sat at our table for a good 45 minutes with obviously empty plates, while the staff walked back and forth past us (we were having a business dinner and had a lot to discuss, so we just talked about that while we waited).  At one point when we ran out of things to talk about, I even tried to follow a waiter so that I could get them to bring us the bill and was ignored.  About an hour AFTER we finished eating (not after we sat down), someone finally came to get our dishes and did not offer us dessert, just left.  I then had to, once again, relive the experience of trying to flag someone down to PAY.I was saddened as I was so very excited to visit this restaurant, but the amazing food was severely eclipsed by the more than terrible service we experienced.  We were there for 2 and a half hours, and about an hour and 45 minutes of that time was purely spent waiting for service or trying to track down one of the staff.  I completely understand that places get busy and things get behind, however there is no reason for anyone to ever have to wait over an hour after they finish their meal to have their plates cleared and have to pay, or wait 30 minutes after they sit down simply to be acknowleged."

I am normally a meat lover (especially when dining out) but decided to come here to try something different. At ChuChai, it's ""something different"" in the best kind of way! Their menu offers a wide variety of choice (both main meal and appetizer). The food is marinated & flavored to near perfection! Their ""faux beef"" does taste like beef - but with an edge!"
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Having read the previous reviews before trying this place, I felt pretty confident that it would make a great location for a friend's birthday dinner. The only negative comments I saw were regarding service, which is not something I'm too bothered by, so I didn't think twice about booking a reservation. Now the funny thing is that I actually thought the service was good. The staff were friendly and the food came quickly (possibly too quickly, but I'll get to that in a second). The problem I had with ChuChai was the food. It was just so...mediocre. Here's a breakdown:First, the menu offers very specific dishes that focus on one or two items, so it really necessitates having to order more than one thing to have a ""complete"" meal. It was difficult to find a dish that had both vegetables and tofu/faux meat, which I found frustrating since I don't want to eat just a bowl of plain vegetables or just a bowl of tofu. All to say that the menu is best experienced by multiple people who are willing to share. Second, the menu gives one star for ""spicy"" and two stars for ""very spicy"". I ordered a one star dish (tofu in peanut sauce with crispy spinach) while my friend ordered a two star (rice noodles with vegan duck in chili sauce). We also split a plate of mixed vegetables, which had no stars. My dish did not have even the faintest hint of spice and my friend's had only what could be described as the memory of it. The mixed vegetables were not only ""not spicy"", but utterly unpsiced - just bland. To be fair, the server did tell us that she did not find the dishes to be spicy herself, but then why does the restaurant have such a ridiculously inaccurate labelling system? Finally, in terms of the quality of the food, we were unimpressed. The tofu in peanut sauce was extremely sweet. The crispy spinach had visible sugar sprinkled on it and the peanut sauce tasted like it was made with syrup. It was the kind of overdone flavour I would expect from a cheap roadside restaurant, not one where the (relatively small) dish cost $18 and didn't even come with rice. My friend's rice noodles tasted old, like they had been cooked in advance (which wouldn't be surprising since it took barely five minutes for our three dishes to arrive). The chili sauce tasted like it came from a bottle - generic and unflavourful. To be fair, the mock duck was excellent, but it was really the only good thing about that dish. We decided to skip on dessert, having had such an underwhelming experience at dinner. All in all, after tax & tip, our three dishes came to over $70 (no drinks). What can I say, I guess I'm in the minority when it comes to ChuChai, but I just don't get the hype. TL;DR: The food is not good - either too sweet or bland. Don't trust the menu's ""spicy"" ratings - even the highest rating has zero kick. Service is good. Price is much too high for both the quality and quantity of the dishes."
/user_details?userid=0w03V5AjlO_EHnRRorlLFQ,Min Min I.,"Waterloo, Canada",5 star rating,"ChuChai does it right. It's obvious from the fact that it's one of the few vegan restaurants that have survived St. Dennis over the past few years. Most of the other establishments have disappeared far from the memories of picky eaters.It's also one of the few Asian vegetarian restaurants that aren't weird, kooky or too ""out there"" for the carnivores. It's clean, classy and sticks with a traditional menu that's meant to be simple yet impressive. Took my Chinese mom and aunt, who were both extremely skeptical, after a visit to Aux Vivres earlier that week. The weren't interested in trying another vegan restaurant and questioning the ingredients. Yet within the first few bites, they were blown away by the salted 'fish' fried rice, which was made with glutinous rice. They also loved my Panang 'beef' curry, with it's delicious red coconut sauce. The spring rolls were outstanding too, and filled with fresh vegetables. Everything was just perfectly flavoured. ChuChai will always be one of my Montreal favourites.MUST TRY: I won't say too much, but the five-flavoured finger food is a fun treat!SUMMER: Have a cocktail on the terrace after shopping on the strip."

I was so excited to have Thai food because I had been craving something soupy and/ or carby.We arrived around 5 p.m. and got outdoor seating because of the nice weather. I ordered the tom yum soup with shrimp ($6CAD) and the stir-fried noodles with duck ($16CAD, I forget the actual name, but it's listed right under the pad thai on the menu), while MC ordered the pad thai ($16CAD).Soup (3/5): Looked good, tasted fine. The shrimp was really weird, though. I'm not sure how to describe it, other than maybe a bit of a soapy taste? In retrospect, I should have gotten tofu or veggies instead of the shrimp.Duck noodles (2.5/5): While the duck was decent, the noodles were pretty bad. They were hard and cold, undercooked and salty. For a while, I was just picking at the veggies because those were the only ingredient with some moisture that the rest of the dish lacked. Pad thai (4/5): I've always been a fan of vegan/ vegetarian pad thai, and this did not disappoint. In fact, it was the redeeming factor of the meal, food-wise. I ended up eating all of MC's leftovers, hehe. There are also prix fixe options, but I believe those were $50CAD/ person, which is vastly overpriced for Thai food, IMO."

Probably the most realistic vegan meat I've ever tasted. And the skin (fried soya sheets) added an extra touch of realism and flavor. The portion of duck was unfortunately small, so I also got a side of crispy spinach (which was so good, highly recommend!). I loved the meal, but the prices are steep for the small portions you get. However, it's definitely a great place to impress your vegan date."

Not only this, but the restaurant had a nice ambiance and the food was sooo good. When traveling in a new city I always like to sit at the bar so I can talk with the bartender about the best places to eat, drink, and experience local culture. Though, sometimes it's hit or miss whether you actually get someone who is willing to take that time to chat with you. When I told the bartender, Elise, that I was from out of town, she immediately took interest in helping me find everything I was looking to do on my adventure. She began writing a list of local places to check out, based on my interests, along with notes on their distinguishing features...and the list did not disappoint. The exceptional service I received from Elise was equally matched by the chef. The food was fresh with clean and distinct flavors. I got the:- Kari Puff: a deep fried philo triangle with a samosa like filling- Deep Fried Dumplings (can't remember which): served with the best sweet and spicy sauce ever - Green Curry with White Rice: it was on the specials menuAll in all it was a great experience accompanied by great food.

So we asked for recommendations from a kind and friendly member of the ChuChai staff. To start, we had the Kiao Satay (dumplings in a peanut sauce) and the Waan Krob (crispy and spicy seaweed). We then had the Lemongrass Soup with chicken; one with and one without coconut milk, both delicious. For our entrees, we had the Beef Penang and the Crispy Duck with Spinach. Everything was phenomenally delicious, but the Beef Penang was particularly outstanding.On subsequent visits, we ordered the same main dishes (they were that good!), but varied the appetizers slightly. Nothing disappointed. If you're vegan or vegetarian, this is a must-try. Even if you aren't, you won't be disappointed by the beautiful environment, delicious food, and wonderful staff."

There were only two negative points. The prices were a tad high (about $18 per curry dish).

The beef has genuinely beefy texture, that of braised meat that falls apart at the touch of a fork. The duck has flesh-like striations and even emulates that layer of fat between the meat and the skin. The shrimp is probably the least realistic, but playful with pink stripes painted on to the curved little nuggets.Our table started with an order of poutine, not knowing what to expect. It was a marvelous play on the classic with crispy fries blanketed in a Thai mock beef salad, piquant with lemongrass, lime and herbs, then topped with diced avocado and arugula. That was my favorite item of the night, though the spicy and flavorful beef panang curry was a close second. The crispy duck came in a sweet and sort of boring soy-based sauce, but the duck was a marvel to be admired. Husband particularly loved the garlicky eggplant with faux shrimp and hoarded it mostly to himself. And the spicy chicken in peanut sauce came with an outstanding crispy spinach reminiscent of kale chips. The only dud was pad thai which didn't live up the excitement of the other dishes. Come here and be astounded."

We're visiting Montreal and decided to give this place a try and were truly impressed. Absolutely amazing food. We skipped starter but shared the Chicken Red Curry, Beef Yellow Curry (all dishes are vegetarian meats) and a side of vegetable fried rice. The chicken dish was very tasty but the beef curry even moreso. Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Even the veggie fried rice had large pieces of veggies in it. I cannot fault anything about the whole meal - wonderfully tasty and all veggie too!My husband also ordered the tapioca dessert which came with a thin layer of coconut cream on top. Oh my, that too was light, tasty and simply fabulous.If you're a vegetarian or vegan you should eat here. If you're a meat eater, you should REALLY eat here, it'll teach you why people give up eating meat when there are such delectable alternatives without the cruelty and chemicals.I cannot recommend ChuChai highly enough - just go.....Now! .....Seriously!"

The food is consistently awesome.  My only complaint is that they don't have more locations. It can be hard to get a table if you want to go for a spontaneous dinner, and every time I've visited it's been a bit cramped.  So it's not a place to chill out and have a relaxed evening. The food is worth it though."

Thai food is full of fish sauce and shrimp paste anyway! We went to Chuchai on our last night in Montreal. It was not cheap but it was really tasty and a great experience altogether. They have menus in English and French which were very convenient for us. We started with the curry puffs and the deep fried seaweed in a sweet and spicy sauce. The curry puffs were nice enough but looked and tasted more or less like samosas. On the other hand, the seaweed dish was amazing! Then we had the fake chicken with peanut sauce and fried spinach. That was so delicious. The spinach was also a bit sweet and unlike anything I tasted before. Very delicate flavours. We also had some red curry which was great too. The sticky rice is absolutely perfect. Our dishes rated 2 on the scale of 3 for spiciness but we did not find then spicy at all. We were told that they do not use dairy or eggs in the cooking, but still use milk in coffee and honey in desserts so it is not yet a vegan restaurant but hopefully they will move to. Totally worth trying in Montreal."

Chuchai is pretty much the same as Chuch which is next door ... except you pay more because it is a tad fancier and a little more formal but in any case (to reiterate) this food is simply substandard when you take into consideration the price that they're asking. If you want really salty fake meat, average concepts, flavourless yet overly salty sauces, microwaved food (I know right?!?) served by slow wait staff, bad music and uncomfortable plastic chairs this is right up your dystopian alley and is probably just the place for you. I really don't know how they have existed for so long seeing as how there are so many excellent vegetarian restaurants in the Plateau, let alone the entire city.

I went all the way back to 1983 to rock that Kajagoogoo reference.  And yes, thank you, I sleep very well at night. ChuChai makes some delicious vegetarian Thai food.  That is still true... HOWEVER, the combination of an increasingly more pedestrian menu and a slightly ridiculous pricing level take away a lot of the goodness found in my previous premise.Aside from the somewhat diminutive portions, you will be in vegvana at first bite of pretty much any of the curries here.  The crispy duck is a culinary masterpiece - as an omnivore I have to profess preferring it to the, you know - ""other"" kind.  Uh huh - really.  Always try the chefs specials as they most are just that - truly special. Service is reasonable - nothing to write home about / nothing to remove stars about. Getting there late in the evening seems to be a bad idea if you want to catch the staff at the top of their game.Honestly - my only fault with the place is the drastic moves down the price quality curve.Are the owners of ChuChai members of the elite group of supervillains that are fabled in song and story (aka my Yelp reviews) as Vegtortionists? Those that hold the veggie and vegan community price hostage for daring to follow their moral compass?  Not yet, but another combo price hike/menu dulling will certain earn them a membership invite."
/user_details?userid=DDnAugUPlKiWDZBh5UWgzg,Angela L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Normally my non-meat based diet revolves around plants, grains, and legumes, but mock meat is one of my guilty pleasures -- especially when it's done really well, as it is at ChuChai. The table d'hote menu is a bit spendy for those on a thriftier budget at $100 for two (and kind of confusing to figure out), but it's worth it for a splurge - you really get to sample a wide variety of menu items. Each person receives one alcoholic beverage and a small sampling of five different appetizers, then you essentially get four main-dish sized portions to split between the table, plus sides of rice. To top it all off, you get sample sized portions of three different desserts and coffee or tea to finish. Everything was delicious (and beautifully plated!), and I was stuffed to the gills by the end of the meal. The mock chicken with the peanut sauce and crispy spinach was a particular standout for me. Good company + table d'hote menu + warm summer evening + outdoor seating = the most fantastic way to spend my final evening in Montreal."

The cocktail menu could've been a little more forthcoming. Titles of drinks don't really tell you anything, so we had to ask about all of them. I had a blushing geisha, which is a refreshing blend of vodka, sake, elderflower syrup, ginger beer and maybe a couple other things. It was super-sweet and also not particularly strong, but tasty enough.The food though. Oh man. So good. We started with a (mock) beef poutine with lemongrass and arugula (maybe? some kind of green). It was the best. Highly, highly recommended -- it doesn't perfectly match Thai food, but it has shadings of the flavor profile, so it doesn't contrast in a bad way. We had five people with a ton of dishes. The least successful was probably the pad thai. I knew going into ordering it that it was probably just there for the unadventurous whose friends dragged them there scared and distraught at the thought of fake meat and contemporary Thai, and so it's meant to comfort and console them. But, I can't not order a pad thai, so I did, and it was fine, but everything else was much better. The highlights for me were the crispy duck and the crispy spinach that came with the chicken in peanut sauce (my friend ordered the chicken ultra-spicy, and I couldn't try it because I'm a big spice wimp in comparison). The spinach is light and a little bit sweet and the crunch is perfect. The duck even replicated that fatty layer that happens between the skin and the meat, and the spice was rich and deeply flavored. There were also a couple of curries and an eggplant dish around the table, and a drunken noodles (pad kee mao). All fantastic, and no one missed the meat at all.Service was supernice, attentive, good water service. Rice was a touch overpriced for serving size, but whatever. I'll be back for sure."

That's a tall order if you're cooking thai food.I'd say it is a bit on the sweet side, everything is slightly sweet, I mean Thai cooking has a lot of sugar but this is is slightly sweeter than usual. Nothing a little lime can't fix really.we ordered pad thai, tofu with peanut sauce and fried spinach, mock penang beef, papaya salad, fried egg noodle which tasted like chow mein, and peanut sauce dumpling. The flavor is distinctly Thai, which is impressive, since a lot of dishes have fish sauce or some sort of prawn paste in it, and frankly i doubt i'm not sure i detect those hints of flavors missing... they found a way to substitute without cutting out the taste.The penang was the weakest, it lacked a bit, but the tofu with fried spinach is spot on. Being a meat eater it's not on top of my list but it's a nice place to go if you have a veggie friend, lol and we all have one or two of those :P"

It's well constructed, flavorful, and they get the texture as close as wheat-gluttenly possible. But it wasn't really the fake meat that got me going. They dishes were beautiful and thoughtfully prepared, from the chef's special appetizer of toasted coconut shreds, lime, peanut, and some magical sauce on a shiso leaf for bite-sized heaven to the ingenious breaded and fried seaweed shreds appetizer in a perfectly spicy sweet/hot sauce. I ordered the fried spinach on Yelp recommendation and we were shocked - how do they flash deep fry in so? And sweet with just a hint of pepper? Amazing. I have a hard time ordering when faced with so many options, but when we finally made our choice (duck with chilis and basil, chicken with spicy eggplant) I couldn't have asked for better - the vegetables were so thoughtfully cut and prepared, the sauces amazing. Service was just fine - suiting and upper-scale casual place such as this. A a large group made the evening louder than I would have liked, but it couldn't have been avoided.

Yet as you chew down on the leafy morsel you begin to wonder whether your mouth's contents are worth $2.50 a bite. Stick to the fried dumplings and the love-bags. Whoever wrote the menu needs to get laid.The portions are OK, although they tend toward the French (small) rather than the American side.

The food is so good. The curry sauce is so delicious. I will go back there again next time when I go back to Montreal. I really recommended this place. I'm Thai so I know what i'm talking about :)

It really didn't disappoint!  I eat meat but love vegetables too and the dishes at ChuCai were delicious!!  We ordered pad thai, vegetarian green curry, and the ""love bag"" (deep fried little ""bags"" of vegetables). Everything tasted really good and authentic, especially the pad thai. I'm a noodle snob and I swear by it! It's not healthy to eat meat all the time anyway, so all you meat lovers who want to try a vegetarian restaurant, this is the place to go to!"

Every dish I order is delicious especially the black pepper duck which taste exactly like duck! I'm no carnivore but I do love occasional meat, but this place? Their mock meat is just AS delicious as the real thing, if anything better! The lemongrass soups are quite good and the shrimp dishes are yummy as well. Everytime I go, I'm never disappointed. Though it is slightly pricey, that's fine. Food quality and service match the prices."
/user_details?userid=52DUFbMTQ7BFTm5HlLgItw,Nathalie R.,"Somerville, MA",4 star rating,"One of the best places in Montreal to get mock meat dishes. It is incredibly expensive and I usually only end up here on special occasions but their food is unique and creative.  I usually stick to one of the curries, and the mock beef but have never had anything here that wasn't delicious. Service is luck of the draw. I've been here before when we were told that we could not stay longer than 2 hours (which we wouldn't have but pointing that out as soon as we sit down is kinda ridiculous). If you're looking for delicious thai vegetarian cuisine this is your best bet in this city."

It started with a cocktail.  We had the MK2 which was heaven!   Actually ordered a second it was so good!  Next came 5 appetizers.  Each one was Devine but our favorite was one with coconut shreds served on a leaf.  The perfect bite.  We went with the editors recommendation on the two entrees we each got and ended up with a double order of duck, beef curry and peanut shrimp with sticky rice and brown rice.  The duck definitely lives up to its reputation and the beef curry was outstanding!   The final course was a sample of desserts with our favorite being a coconut rice pudding.  Best dinner we've ever had!  And the staff were polite and very hospitable.  Had a lovely conversation with a waiter whose mother is one of the cooks.  Very nice young man.  Over all the experience far exceeded our expectations!   Will definitely make  our way back to Montreal to get to experience the amazing restaurant again!"

But chu chai does something very special and unique with theirs.  If you have been disappointed by faux meat in the past, give this place a try before you shun it forever.During the last visit, we ordered the duck which was Incredible.  10/10  Be sure to order this when you head there!My friend said the duck was better than any ""Real"" duck she had had!We also order the basil chicken which was fantastic as always and the pad thai.  Oh and the dumplings were fantastic!This place is one of the reasons why I crave visits to Montreal."

Don't arrive on the weekend without a reservation tho."

The salads were inventive and I ate every bit of mine. The menu maintains a sense of fusion with dishes being plated in intriguing ways to combine flavours. For example the Duck Salad was cut as a slaw, making it very easy to get a bite of everything at once. And the stuffed tofu was to die for! Tasted exactly like a Vietnamese sub.  Our server did his job well and was very polite. The only downsides I saw were the tables on the patio are so cramped, there really is no privacy and when they say spicy. They mean white person spicy. Not actually hot. It comes off as hoity toity and expensive, but really it was laid back and affordable."

Wish we had been able to go back again to try the pad thai because the diners behind us ordered it and it looked amazing!"
/user_details?userid=on4PBkuSAUi8gqlJHSyefA,Michelle A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to ChuChai the last two times I visited Montreal and I've had great experiences both times. The restaurant serves all vegetarian Thai food and has 'fake' duck, shrimp, beef, chicken, as well as plain vegetarian and tofu dishes. I'm not usually a fan of 'fake' meat - but decided to try out fake beef - I had a yellow curry dish with potatoes, beef and carrots with sticky rice. Very flavourful curry. The beef tasted a lot like beef to me (although it's been a while) - much more flavourful and a lot less dry than tofu. I've also tried a stirfry with bok choi and mushrooms  - it was tasty, but not as exciting as the rest of the menu options. I had the fresh spring rolls both visits, which are nice and light - two big pieces that are perfect for sharing."
/user_details?userid=1HYk5r-vd03u4nOg8bs6kQ,Asad Q.,"Saint-Lazare, Canada",4 star rating,My wife and I love (and cook) thai food. If you like non-vegetarian thai you'll love this restaurant. The breaded crispy mushroom appetizer reminded me of general tao. Great Tom Yum. The duck not only tasted like duck but also looked like roast duck (how did they do this?). There's this amazing appetizer - something like 5 flavors finger food which is eaten wrapped in a leaf - delicious! Fair price. Great service. Only improvement would be better furnishings.
/user_details?userid=Myy-tV1aKksxkQ2R7QUkAQ,Kwoky L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Hate killing animals but couldn't resist the smell of succulent meat? You know who you are. At Chu Chai, there is no shame in trying because all the meats are completely vegetarian made from soy protein. The spicy duck with basil was excellent but the red/panang curry beef was to die for! The texture was so tender and succulent, I almost forgot it was vegetarian. The curry was well balanced, not overly spicy or oily. Simply delicious! You also have to try Lily's highly rated (by chefs) appetizer but I forgot the name. It's served in a leaf with toasted coconut, plum sauce and lime. It was truly amazing."
/user_details?userid=758g6NGLp9deCbvowz62Ww,Jennifer P.,"Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,"I used to live on St. Denis and I loved ordering from Chu Chai on weekends, when I wanted a treat. As a student, I ate very plainly â"" mostly baguettes and sandwich meats, eggs and toast, baked beans, cereal. Chu Chai was introduced to me by a beau at the time, and weâd get take out when we were both bogged down with work and at least treat our bellies to a taste of âthe good life.â Chu Chai is vegetarian, but it has amazing mock chicken, shrimp and beef made from soy products. The Thai flavours are exquisite, and my favourite was the hot&sour soup with shrimp and lemon grass. For veggies and vegans who crave meat once in a while but donât want to give up their practices, this is a good place for a pseudo-meat indulgence. Youâll probably even trick your tastebuds into thinking itâs meat. The mock chicken feels and even tastes exactly like chicken. Thereâs no dairy in the cooking except some egg. Itâs fairly pricey, so for us students it was a treat instead of a night out at the bar."

As a vegetarian, you can go here and order ANYTHING off the menu. It's a real treat, if you are used to just the tofu section at the asian places.  Peanut chicken is one of my faves. You can order off the menu or they will heat up some of items in the deli case. I don't remember the price difference between the two, but whatever is cheaper- go with that one."
