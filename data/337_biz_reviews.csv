/user_details?userid=-WtejdYFqQtasngfqbMdGA,Samantha S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Came across this resto as we were staying at the Fairmont across the street. Read a review that it had amazing blueberry donuts, which swayed our decision to try Sunday brunch. Slightly disappointed that they don't actually serve these. Located in Place Ville Marie on the 44th floor - stunning views of Montreal but I would recommend making a reservation and requesting a window table prior to dining. Unfortunately we walked in without a reservation and the hostesses were rude and snobby, particularly one. We were given a high top table near the front entrance and were told that the entire restaurant was booked up for brunch. Our party consisted of 1 child and 1 baby, in which this hostess was happy to seat the baby on the floor without a high chair. Not very accommodating. It was difficult to not notice that there had been an empty table by the window with 2 high chairs available a few tables over from us... which stayed vacant the entire time we were there. Regardless of the crappy welcome, the food combined with the atmosphere was quite nice. The service for the remainder of the experience was good. It is definitely on the pricier side but would still recommend at least once. Roasted cauliflower was a unique dish with squid ink aioli - would recommend. Breakfast poutine was pretty good but not amazing. Chocolate-banana waffles were also good, but not amazing. Four stars for the experience. We were also able to head out to the observatoire after brunch, which was really nice."

On a clear night, you can see for miles in any direction from this rooftop restaurant and bar. Full bar featuring top shelf liquors and one of a kind mixed cocktails. The food is spectacular and each bite draws you in more. Whether it be for you,  a party of two, or more, there is something for all to partake in here. The bartenders are good. The servers and service, were a little slow. But the atmosphere is enchanting and energetic. There is also an observatory at this location. I believe  the tickets are $20-21. If you buy a ticket and eat or drink at the restaurant, you will receive a $9 credit on your restaurant tab. Worth the visit. It is quite the treat. Bon Apetit."
/user_details?userid=Q1INbJRvzHJoEckiBOTU9g,Christy M H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This place was the absolute BEST. It was my first time coming here and I was utterly surprised with the presentation and service of this place. Located on the top floor of a RBC building, this restaurant offers a beautiful view of the city along with a great variety of different food. The plates are huge and filling, the prices are beyond reasonable and the waitresses are super helpful and nice. It was super clean which I really appreciated and they also had a large variety of different drinks. They close at 10 but if you are already in the building they'll allow you to finish your food with no rush which I was really gratefulfor. This place gets my highest recommendation and is now my favorite dinner place in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",4 star rating,"Totally can't believe I never wrote my review for this place. No matter, it was such a memorable experience that it still feels like it was just this past summer, not already over a year and a half ago! Food itself is a mediocre 3 stars especially given the price, but the view n the service bumps this to 4 stars for me, for sure!We came for an anniversary dinner June 24 2018. They sat us near a window despite being so last minute on a holiday (our anniversary is good ol St Jeanny B day so it's a pain in the butt finding places that are open). We had a spectacular view and we even got to see fireworks going off in all parts of the city and south shore it was fabulous! We both ordered the same thing because there was all of about 10 options (I may be lowballing it, but only slightly) and things like ribs (covered in sauce) didn't seem like a very smart, nor appropriate, choice for an anniversary dinner. So we both went with the Caesar salad entrée with their steak n fries plate. The Caesar 'cuz we had heard it was not to be missed here, those reviews and all the people who say that are absolutely right! Do get this! 4.5 stars for the caesar. So much so, that me n my bf both decided our next meals here will just be the meal size caesar with added grilled chicken instead of bothering with anything else. The steak unfortunately was more tra la la ingredients with a very meh outcome. Herb crusted butter sounded fancy and looked appealingly sinful but didnt really do much for the flavour. The cooking was as requested, it even had a nice crispy slight char outer edge, which I love, but the flavour was just .. ' yah alright '. I make a MEAN steak at home w just simple Montreal Steak Spice (bien sur!) and cheap a$$ cuts of steak! So, if ur guna veer off Mtl traditional, with a better cut of beef on top of it, well then u better bring a better A-game than that, guys. It seemed like a small cut for the price but we were so bored and tired of chewing by the end it was more than sufficient portion. The fries were fine, nothing you can't find in a million places in Mtl. I honestly can't remember if we partook in dessert, but I do know our red wine was spot on. Service was sweet and it was a beautiful romantic dinner that I would repeat again, though just stick with the salad. Stick with the salad? I can't believe I just said that.."

We got a table in the middle of the restaurant on the high table (bar) it was perfect! Since we really got to enjoy the entire 360 view! The service was so fun and amazing! Patrick if you're reading this you are awesome and I hope to always get YOU when we come by! I think the menu was great! Very simple and straightforward. For starters we had the beet salad & warm goat cheese - it was honestly nothing special. Then we had the warm burrata with artichoke and it almost was like an artichoke dip! It was so delicious! I'm still craving itThen for the main course we had the beef cheeks- very tender & delicious with some side of vegetables that were cooked perfectly! And so tasty! VEGETABLES tasty?!?! YUP. And then we had the mushroom ravioli pasta! It was good ,the pasta was perfectly cooked! For dessert we had the pudding chomer and let me tell you.. THAT was the best pudding chomer I ever had in my life! Since the service was a bit slow and they kinda forgot about us at some point they sent us a extra little something which I though was so sweet! We never complained or anything so the fact that they took it upon themselves was very professional and because of that gesture and the view obviously I would definitely be coming back , it's very important when a restaurant treats their clientele with this kind of love! I'm all for it. The wine list is great! We took a Chilean white wine .. it was just overall s great experience and I'm excited to be coming back to try their set menu!"

The menu is the same and the food tastes the same. I've never eaten anything here that was amazingly delicious but I've had decent meals for the price. I always find the prices a bit high but here it makes sense given the ambiance. I think this is just such a great location for a restaurant. Brunch, business lunch, drinks, or dinner with friends/significant other. It's perfect for any occasion. Make sure you reserve in advance if you want a good table."

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Going to a restaurant for the first time is like a first date, no idea what to expect -may be a hit or miss. The second date follows when things go really well or you want to give it another chance. This was my second date with the restaurant: Les Enfants Terribles for a weekend brunch (first date was for dinner ). With the current construction going on in PVM- finding the restaurant was a whole other ordeal. When we got to the elevators, a sign read ""staff Christmas party closing at 2 pm"". I was a bit frazzled since our reservation was at 1 pm- an hour to eat seems rushed. The hostess then mention they wouldn't be taking any new reservations but people already dining would have until 4 pm to finish. Phewf.Crowded as always and not much of a skyline feel to this place. We were quickly served with menus. There wasn't a lot of options for a brunch menu to select from ranging from 10-14$. A very ordinary menu. I opted for a traditional breakfast at 11$ that came with a choice of bacon or sausage, 2 eggs, bread, potatoes and morsels of fruit. Presentation was not appealing. The bread was a toasted sourdough bread - that was really hard to eat because it was so tough. I had to down my mint tea to move it down, it was so dry.I do have to highlight service was excellent and quick. I was content that with tax and tip - it came out to 15$ (one of my cheapest meals). But I was not happy with my meal.  As for my second date- I think this is where it ends. Unless there is some serious changes to the menu - I don't see this place being anywhere near one of Montreal's top restaurants."

/user_details?userid=LkP5uU4ncr5MgNp8ercSCA,Annie P.,"Fairfax, VA",4 star rating,"Unfortunately, it was raining during my best friend's bachelorette brunch so we weren't able to enjoy the view, but it cleared up towards the end of our meal so we were able to see a portion of the city landscape. The restaurant is on the 44th floor and has floor to ceiling windows (plus an outdoor patio area) that overlooks the city of Montreal.Large party reservations were easily made through their website (we had a party of 11!). Our server was patient when handling our large party orders and always made sure our drinks were refilled. Their brunch drinks include mimosas, spirtzes, bloody marys, bloody caesars, and a coffee liquor drink. They also have mocktails for non-drinkers as well! Their menu consists of typical brunch items such as french toast, egg, bagels. They also have breakfast poutine (a must try while you're in Canada!). The food came out in a sporadic order but we all got the orders right.The food wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but you're here for the view and the experience."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The underground parking is only $5 if you tell the parking attendant that you are going to Enfants Terribles. The entrance is at McGill College and Cathecart street. We booked through OpenTable then called in to specify a window seat. We were seated on the far side of the restaurant and turns out it was perfect cause it gives a good view of the Grand Roue AND the Bonsecours Basin--where the Natrel fireworks were happening later that evening! A happy coincidence!!A reservation is typically 2 hours so we ate very slowly to stay until 8pm for the fireworks. This is the time where you want the service to be slow but in our case, it turned out to be pretty fast. Our drinks and appetiser arrived within minutes of us ordering.  We took the two mocktails--the mojito and joie de vie. The mojito was alright and the joie de vie was flavorful. We went for the roasted cauliflower and it was goood :) Our server offered to cut it for us but only after I snapped a pic, of course! The cauliflower was nicely roasted around the edges and had a really warm roasted smell and flavor. The squid ink added the savory component. We cleaned the plate with our forks! I think this dish is unique and worth a try. For the mains, we had their AAA burger and the beef tartar with a side of fries. The burger had a nice grill flavor to it, fairly small. I liked the fries--they're thin with skin and not overly greasy and served with a side of mayo. We had the pudding chomeur and it was sweet and good but best for sharing. Also tried the pear crumble but I found some of the pears undercooked so they were still a bit hard.And our supper ended with a bird's eye view of the fireworks in the Old Port.  Overall, the view was great with the fireworks, the service was good and the food was quite alright!  An enjoyable date night."

The restaurant itself was situated on the 44th floor and had a beautiful patio space overlooking the city.It was bright and sunny so we decided to grab a seat on the patio. Our server was very prompt and patient as we inquired about different menu items. I ordered the spaghetti calamari and chorizo. We were served bread and butter while they prepared our dishes.I have to say, this was a really delicious dish. I enjoyed the creaminess of the pasta from the carbonara sauce and the egg yolk. The pieces of calamari were quite tender and the chorizo was plentiful in the dish. I love the food here and the spectacular view!"

Waitress was nice and welcoming. Waters/drinks came at a good speed. Food took a little long but overall it was okay. The food was VERY average. We ordered the pork ribsGood sauce on the ribs, tangy but sweet. Cold slaw was sour a little with an odd taste at the end. Fries were just regular fries. Fish and chips were okay. Crispy on the outside but lacked a little salt. And fries Again average and cold slaw odd taste at the end. My Mac and cheese was also very average. They cheapened out on the crispy crust which is a huge part, barely any bacon and it was lacking in taste. I had to add the bbq sauce from the pork ribs to give it some flavour.The breakfast poutine was pretty good. Good ratio of pulled pork to potatoes and good amount of sauce. Also took the healthy special which is just a yogurt parfait with fruit.It's a great location, although with all the construction happening it was a little hard to get too but not their fault. In summer it's 100% a great view!Overall it was okay. Not sure if I would go back to eat."

The food is decently prices for the quality and the view is breathtaking! I'd suggest making a reservation if you're going in the evening, as it gets busy.Both times I've been, I got the tartare (salmon the 1st time and beef the 2nd time) and it was delicious. Their rosé and whiskey were great too."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The view is really, really worth it. We went today and the weather was beautiful. It was a little windy and chilly to sit outside, so we went for a table next to the windows. The menu is without surprises, similar to what you would find at restaurants where the view is the main attraction (e.g. Ciel! Bistro-Bar in Quebec City).  We ordered fried calamari, Signature Caesar salad, Chakchouka 2 Eggs and Bénés Mer. The service was excellent, and the coffee/food arrived fairly quickly without a hitch. Everything was very nicely presented, with good sized portions. The food was good without been excellent. The tomatoes in the Shakshuka needed more simmering time, as they were still watery and unidimensional in flavor. The bread was very good, and great with the eggs! The Caesar salad was perhaps the most difficult dish to eat for a very technical reason: the leaves were huge, and a lot of knife/fork work was necessary to avoid getting dressing all over the face. The flavor of the fried calamari was very good, especially with the sauce. The smoked salmon went great with the Eggs Benedict.In sum, really beautiful view that will impress visitors and locals alike. Food becomes secondary."

We ordered appetizers and a few pasta dishes and ate family style, which they seemed to have no issue with. The wait staff was attentive and helpful and even took photos for us. This place has an amazing view and is a great place to celebrate a special event.  Of all the things we ordered, the carpaccio was amazing, and the mac n cheese and the Caesar salad are the standouts to me. The carbonara was good, but not as good as the mac n cheese, which had kale and prosciutto- absolutely amazing! Get the large- it is even better the next day :)Definitely make a reservation online!"

If you are a tourist or simply want one of Montreal's best view, here it is!Apart from the view, the food at ""Les Enfants terrible"" was never really good. Every time I go to them it's because I have friends wanting to go there. If was up to me, I would pass. If have been to the one in Ile-des-Soeurs and Outremont. This one only confirms that there are all the same, average quality food. This time, my hamburger was burned (meat overcooked and black).

/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Someone suggested meeting here for lunch on a Saturday and since I've never been here, I decided to give them a try after checking out their website.To get to Les Enfants Terribles, you have to go to what I consider the RBC area/section of Place Ville Marie. There are signs within the main PVM complex so it is almost impossible to get lost. Once you get to the RBC area/section of Place Ville Marie, you take the elevators, get out of the elevators and take another elevator to get up to the floor where Les Enfants Terribles is located.We were asked if we had a reservation and we mentioned that we didn't and we were asked if we had an issue with sitting at the bar. We didn't so we were seated immediately.I ordered the fish & chips while the person that I was with ordered a fruit salad. I found the fish and chips to be very good. The fries were the type of fries that I liked (cut potatoes and didn't seem like they were purchased pre-cut from a grocery store). The fruit salad looked tasty as well.The washroom/toilet was relatively clean and well maintained. It is located outside the restaurant where you have to go past the elevator.After eating, we went to the outside to take a look at the view and take a few pictures. To prevent accidents or possibly jumpers, the entire area is enclosed behind glass so pictures don't really show an unobstructed view of the city as the windows weren't ""crystal clean"" on the day that we went due to the weather (but pictures were still nice)Going to and leaving the restaurant, I found that the elevator can get very crowded which was a minor inconvenience."

There's an elevator specifically for Les Enfants Terribles. You need to take it to go all the way up then get off to grab another one to keep going up. When you get off there was a nice lady who greeted us and showed us to the bar.The view is stunning! So beautiful. You see all of Montreal from up there. Great for date night, girls night out or happy hour with colleagues.We sat at the bar had a couple of drinks and was skeptic about ordering anything cause I've had heard mixed reviews about their food.In the end I was hungry and the alcohol was starting to hit so decided to try the chorizo pogos and French fries and they were awesome! The pogos, especially, were the best. So light yet crispy and very flavorful. Now all I want to do is go back to try more things.If you haven't had the change to try this place out, I highly recommend it, and if for whatever reason you don't like the food or wtv, go for the view!"

For me the price is reasonable since the restaurant is set at the top of Montreal, and has a great view to the city. Food is delicious. We ordered the homemade pudding and salmon, which are recommended by the waiter, absolutely a wise and tasty choice.Overall, lovely experience at les Enfant. We enjoyed the view of Montreal."

End of your workday, you want to take a girl out or go for afterwork with the boyz (and then get you a girl there) then that is the place.Most people try to look a bit nice, prices aren't crazy and it made me happy so I could get tipsy on that rooftop. The 1st one I go to in Montreal. The way you get your drink is a little weird, 1st a desk where you order and pay, then another one where you pick up your drink (Tim Horton's style I guess).Les Enfants Terribles is mostly a restaurant on the other side of that rooftop bar. One of my very close foodie friend told me it's one of his top 10 but book ahead and get ready to drop some cash cause it ain't cheap.Enjoy"

It was very tasty, especially after a somewhat stressful flight through some very harsh flying weather!I had the waitress chose my wine, mainly because I'm unable to read French. Now still being new to wine and developing a palate it was very satisfying.I would recommend coming here to anyone who enjoys fine dining with a cozy atmosphere!Cheers Yelpers!11 hrs later edit- I had to provide 5 stars.

Our waitress came by to take our drinks order; I was little weirded out by their uniform. It is such fancy restaurant, and they are wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts... seriously? She was very nice though.I had got grilled shrimps with watermelon and feta cheese as an entree. What a delightful dish. It was refreshing, and the spices on shrimps were dancing in my mouth. Then I ordered the burger since I read in Montreal blog, that Les Enfants Terribles have an amazing burger, but I was disappointed with it. It was over cooked that I can taste the burns mostly.

The cocktails tasted really good and so did the calamari. The calamari reminded me of frankies and benny's back in England. Made us a bit nostalgic. The main dishes were something we had no idea of how they'd taste. However they turned out to be brilliant. I had the sea bass with cauliflower, cheese and roasted onion. The texture of the vegetables perfectly complimented the fish and it tasted brilliant. I loved it. The taste of the food along with the view made our day.

You can see all of Montreal from it plus my friends and I went on a sunny day so it was so gorgeous!!! I can't get over it still :) so definitely take pics if u do go there. We had a reservation but when I came in I saw it was pretty full so definitely call in advance to make a reservation. Now for the food in my opinion not the best :( there was barely anything to order from plus we went during lunch time do the menu was even more limited. Although the portion size was pretty good for one person. I got the vegan bowl which I found was mediocre in taste but portion wise it was more than filling. For dessert we got the chocolate mousse and that was veryyyy tasty I really liked it even though it was $6 for a small portion. The prices in my opinion were a bit too expensive but in all honesty you're paying for the view. But the waiters were really friendly and they answered every question we had !!! Side note if you want to go to the observatory you have to pay an extra $10 even if u dined at the place and we thought that sucked a bit but the view just from the restaurant made up for it so it was chill.

The only negative was that it was hard to find-we walked aRound the entire building outside and never saw any sign indicating where the restaurant was.

Check the weather because I didn't know prior to arriving that this was an elevated, outdoors (if you choose) restaurant. The decor, service, and food really make you feel like you're eating at some Michelin star bougie restaurant, only it's affordable and you don't have to donate a kidney for a meal!!!! The starter bread is so fresh and doughy. My mother and I got the grilled calamari to share, which was absolutely enjoyable. Good texture because it wasn't over cooked like it easily can be, and the flavors kept my taste buds working and wondering. For meals we shared the quinoa bowl and AAA burger. Burger was standard, no fuss and no mistakes, hit the spot. The quinoa bowl is really something! HUGE portion size of various roasted veggies peppered with a tangy flavorful sauce, sitting on top of a bed of red quinoa that's also delicious by itself. We left stuffed! We also asked to switch tables in the beginning so we could sit in the shade and we were accommodated with a friendly face--awesome service! This restaurant needs its rating bumped up for sure."

Definitely an amazing view, and I would recommend coming for just that. Had a party of 2, and our food was also very good, I got the special of ham Benedict with potatoes. They messed up my order at first but the waitress had the kitchen bring me out an entire new plate, top notch service. The orange-strawberry mimosa was also my fave!I was weary at first because I read some of the bad reviews.. but only complaint is that the construction around Ville-Marie is very draining and off-putting. We were so lost trying to find the restaurant, and the surrounding area was loud and dusty. Being UP in the restaurant though was amazing, no complaints there. Try it out, then make your own review!"

The place was packed, but emptied slowly and we had a table right away.I must say, they are conveniently located, but there is hundreds of people working around that area, so I do understand the others' comments when they say service was slow. We felt a bit underdressed, seeing all the business people wearing suits eating in there, and we were dressed casual (it is a casual-dressing place...), but that must be the effect of place Ville-Marie.I cannot complain of the service we had, we were in and out within one hour. The couple next to us actually told the waiter they only had 45 minutes and were also served in time.The view must be very nice from there (old 747 club!) but it was quite rainy on the day I went. They ran out of the fish option of the menu du jour. The soup was tasty (menu du jour) and our plate (beef ribs that they were called, but it was a piece of beef) was maybe a 3.5/5, but for the view and the service, I decided to up it to a 4/5. They serve alcohol and have the Belgian Moon beer too :)"

The lamb came right off the bone and was cooked well enough that you get the flavor of the lamb but it w asn't too too gamey.The poutine was standard and the service at the bar was pretty good. Go into place ville marie and find the elevator with their logo; it brings you all the way up, switch elevators then go up again.Overall I would come back here again, would recommend because of the good service too!"

Had a reservation for a group of 12 for noon, they began taking our orders at 12:30ish (I ordered a beef tartar which comes with a salad plus fries - sold separately). I finally got my beef tartar around 1:30 (one hour later) which I had time to finish while I was still waiting for the fries, had to ask the waiter about them as he apparently had forgotten about us.... I received the fries around 1:40 had to eat quickly because you know, I had to get back to work... And of course, I never had the salad  :-/ Then came the time for the bills, they charged us for the salads many of us never received: The whole billing process was very confusing.There was nothing spectacular about the food, I had better tartars... As per the view, it is very nice but it's kinda part of my daily routine. The main reason we wanted to try this place was to enjoy a great meal and have a good time at a restaurant which is located two seconds away from our office (lucky us we thought) ...

My husband took me here for a surprise anniversary dinner and I fell in love. He knows my love for architecture, bridges & skylines so this definitely was the best place to bring me. I don't understand the bad reviews? What is not to like? The interior is absolutely gorgeous - black and white with rustic themes contrasting against the sleek modern look of curtain walls & chandelier-type uplighters on tables.We were escorted to a great table with the perfect 180 view. The tables are super close to each other so it's a tight squeeze as many chairs and tables have been crammed onto the terrace. We ordered the grilled shrimp served on a bed of feta & watermelon for starters - very tasty but quite a small portion. For my main course, I had the fish & chips which I was extremely impressed by! Coming from the country where Fish & Chips is a staple food, many places here have failed to impress me. But this one gets my vote! The cod was covered in a perfect thick & crispy batter, the fries were delicious and the accompaniments just enhanced the flavours more - a unique coleslaw with coriander, super tasty! I also had the meli melu, a watermelon mojito type cocktail. It was OK, would not order again. Service was great, despite it being a weekend evening and prices were surprisingly reasonable for such a location. The best part of the evening? We dined whilst witnessing the gorgeous sun set over Mont Royal... it was magical, the terrace was bathed in hues of oranges & pinks... suddenly everything looked perfect under a real-life Instagram-type filter moment!"

The restaurant had a modern and trendy vibe, but it was darker and louder than I would've liked.  We were also seated quite close to the tables next to us in the centre of the dining area, so it was hard to enjoy the view outside. However, after our meal, we did get out to the patio to explore a bit, which was a cool experience!Food: 3.5/5  We ended up ordering from the MTL a table menu - I had the smoked salmon with onion, celery and artichokes, braised lamb with lemon, mushrooms, and carrot puree, and the orange and squash cream.  The salmon and lamb both tasted good, but I did wish there was more carrot puree for the lamb.  The orange squash cream was a good combination and not too sweet which I liked, however there were very big pieces of crumble on the bottom which was hard to chew.   Overall satisfactory meal.Service: 3/5  It was very busy when we arrived, so service was a bit slower.  For example, we did not receive our bread for a long time (after the first course was served).  Overall friendly though.Price: 3/5  Reasonable for the amt of food and view at the topOverall: 3.5/5  Overall good experience.  I would say the food and service are average, and we came mostly for the cool view of the city, which we got a chance to check out after our meal!"

When calling to make the booking i made sure to include that i will be bringing a small cake, they notified me about the ""cutting fee which is 3$ per person"" I thought this was quite ridiculous but whatever i went with the flow. Upon arriving, we ordered some mousseux and appetizers and proceeded to the food.  As for the cake part, i went with cupcakes that i distributed myself at the end of the meal and in hopes to avoid the ""cake cutting fee""Which did not happen.I was still charged 36$ FEE.

We had a reservation made weeks ago and they were still an hour late seating us. By the time we had food in front of us it was almost 1h 45m after the start of our reservation.   The service was polite but uninterested. As I said above, the appetizers were well visioned. But the mains were disappointing. The sides - french fries (cold) and salad (over dressed) were nothing special. The mains - at our table the steak, veal chop, pasta and fish - all had issues, mostly with seasoning and temperature. Honestly for what we paid for the meal and for what is available in Montreal to eat, even with the view  this place is worth skipping."

The place was full but we were immediately assigned to our table which was at the window with an amazing view. The food again was good however the service was still below expectations for a place like this; lots of comings and goings with waiters forgetting coffees and beverages and coming back to double check on the order..The prices are affordable for what you eat.In my opinion, the only factor making this place popular is its location on the last floor of the Ville Marie Bldg with an amazing view on Mtl"

We got our food in a quick and efficient manner (although we did have to ask our waiter for the free bread). The food (mac and cheese and spaghetti carbonara) was delicious. The spaghetti carbonara  had the egg yolk on top which I then mixed in myself, which I thought was a cool unique spin on the meal. The meals were both visually appetizing and tasteful. The restaurant was surprisingly affordable too. We paid about 110 but keep in mind we ordered 4 drinks total, which added to almost half the bill, which is what you would expect when ordering drinks in most larger cities. The drinks were also pretty good. Definitely strong, they didn't hold back on the booze, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone goes for the views, which are without a doubt incomparable, but the food really brings it to the next level to give it the fifth star. Will be back next time I'm in Montreal."

I have to say the staff was extremely nice and helpful with regards to the proposal; they definitely played an important role in the whole process, so a big thank you! But, proposal aside, here are my thoughts on the place:I had been wanting to come to Les Enfants Terribles ever since it opened earlier this year, to see the views over Montreal. However, since its basically winter now, the restaurant was all closed up (to keep the cold out) but you can still see the city, as all the walls are huge windows.We arrived around 6:30pm, to find basically a full house and a loud crowd. The noise level went down drastically around 7pm, when the groups at the bar left (our table was in the bar section). For starters, we got the French onion soup and the salmon tartare; both were very good. For mains, we got the calamari and chorizo carbonara pasta and the strip loin steak; both were also good, Alex's steak more so than my pasta. Overall we had a great time and meal at Les Enfants Terribles. The food was pretty good for the most part and I would eat here again. However, I found the prices very expensive for what we got (in terms of what we ordered, the quality and the quantity); its clear that prices are hiked up because of the location of the restaurant. As well, I would definitely prefer to return in the summer, to better enjoy the views of the city.For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was last here August of last year just to enjoy the view and have a drink. I was honestly scared to come back and try the food because of all the bad reviews online. My aunt wanted to come because she never went to this location having been to the one on Bernard a few times. She wanted to see the view and she wanted to take me here for my birthday so we went Wednesday after work with low expectations. We got a good seat next to the window. I recommend that you request a seat close to the glass when you reserve so that you can admire the view. The view is the #1 selling factor! I ordered the Bloody d'ici cocktail. It's basically a bloody Caesar in a small glass. It was thick and contained gin, vodka and rum but surprisingly didn't taste as strong as one would expect. My aunt ordered a glass of chardonnay and we shared the fried calamari entrée. The fried calamari was just ok. I've had way better elsewhere. It was a bit on the chewy side but still a step up from the fried calamari I had the night before at le Blumenthal. We took our time and I had more drinks and they did not rush us to order which I liked. I ordered an Aperol Spritz which had a bit more Aperol than I normally put when I make it but that's ok because I don't mind the bitter taste of Aperol. Then I ordered a glass of red wine to go with my beef tartare main.The beef tartare was surprisingly good! It was a good size and came with croutons. It had a layer of parmesan on it which I really enjoyed! For sides there was a choice of salad or fries and the waiter allowed me to have both which I greatly appreciated. The fries were pretty good! They were crispy and salty. The salad was simple... mainly just greens with radishes which I removed because I don't like radishes. My aunt ordered the Cornish hen. The plate was huge! I tried a piece and it was fine. It wasn't wow but nothing beats the Cornish Hen like the one at Bar George. We were both full and did not order dessert. I would recommend this restaurant because the view is just amazing and the view alone makes it worth coming here! And you know what, the food is really not that bad! It's really A-Ok. Just don't come with high expectations. The décor is nice and I think its romantic enough for a date. I particularly liked the candelabra on the tables. The only thing I found weird was that the chairs were kind of low for the table."

It was packed and we had to wait over an hour before having a table. For those who don't mind sitting at the bar, it goes faster and they have more room.We started with a bottle of red wine and sparkling water. As appetizer, we got a plate of charcuterie consisting of 2 types of meat served with bread and pickles, and a plate of fried calamari served with a spicy mayo. The food is average so I will say, don't expect to get the best food in the city here. While the waitress poured us the sparkling water, I saw an eyelash over the lemon slice on my glass. I told her and she immediately went to change my glass, gave us a new bottle of sparkling water and didn't charge us for the first one either. All the staff was very attentive and friendly. The service was excellent from the beginning to the end. I've never come for brunch or dinner so I won't be able to tell you much about the main dishes but I will definitely recommend this place for a drink and appetizer while enjoying the beautiful sunset falling in the city."

/user_details?userid=cXH0QOJVRAw0GvIrZnWnaw,Simon Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am surprised by all the bad reviews for this pretty great and unique restaurant. I have gone to Les Enfants Terribles on multiple occasions: brunch inside, brunch on the terrasse, drinks...and have found it to be great in a consistent manner throughout these visits. First of all, let me highlight one point people seem to forget: the prices are not any higher than if this restaurant was at the street level (!) Have you ever been to a restaurant up in the sky that did not charge you three times the amount you would have paid otherwise? The prices are reasonable for the food you're getting and on top of that you get to enjoy an amazing view!The dishes and drinks I've had all tasted good, although not extraordinary, and my friends and family were always very satisfied with their meals. The service was always courteous and I have never had a any sort of problem. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who's never gotten to enjoy such a view!"

Pretty disappointed about the Mtl à table 3 courses menu. The salmon appetizer was ok. The lamb was way too dry and not seasoned enough. The dessert was ok. The service was very slow. Our friend didn't get his rib till we all got our dishes and started to eat ( it was so slow to the point the dishes would get cold if we waited for him longer). Overall, the tasting menu is 41$ before taxes and tips. Definitely not worth it and I'll probably not return if it's not for the view."
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Les enfants terribles has always been on my must try brunch list. You already feel extra fancy going up the elevator to the 44th floor, but the you haven't seen the view yet. The view on the terrasse is just wooow! Surprisingly, everything on the menu was not expensive at all, although the deco and the view looks really fancy. I checked their dinner menu, and let's say I am glad I came for lunch, coz the price range for dinner is a lot higher than that of the brunch. I went there with my family and ordered pretty much a bit of everything from the brunch and lunch menu.- Fish taco: You really need to squeeze in some lime because it can taste a bit bland and boring. I love the texture of the fish, it was almost like shrimps as it was actually really chewy. It comes in hard shell tacos, although I would have prefered soft ones. Was not blown away, was ok.- AAA Beef Burger: Ordered this for my uncle. He let me have some, and I must say the patty was really bland, not even juicy. The fries were soso. Really disappointed.- Smoked salmon egg benedict: After I tried l'Avenue's benny eggs I don't think any other places can do it better. - Breakfast poutine: Probably the best thing I ordered at the place. The sauce was really good, not sure what they put in it had an after taste of beer somehow. The pulled pork in the poutine was amazing, flavorful with a hint of sweetness. The cheese on top was delish although it hardened afterwards... I wish they put in more dauce though because at the end tbere was nothing to eat the potato with. - Salmon tartar: Tasted good, but was not woow. They only give us two pieces of chips/nachos to eat the tartar with. Wish they give some more lol- Charcuterie: The platting was great, super instagramable. Came with 2 slices of toasts. The platter was really diverse and they had different kind of sauces and pickles on the side- Jus the vie: Loved the drink! Was super good with just the right amount of sweetness- Rose cheesecake: Was like the cherry on top of the sundae, made us end the meal nicely. Not too heavy, the cheesecake was actually light and fluffy in texture, not too condensed. And the sauce poured on top did have rose aroma.If I want to impress a friend I will probably bring them there because the view is truly nice, but I cant say the same for the food. Still prefer l'Avenue more. I will probably try their dinner menu next time."
/user_details?userid=_MYQcazSUXBsWUYQJHHLQg,Fleur M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I am writing this review while actually still being inside the restaurant.It has been 2 hours since we've been seated and we are still waiting on our food to come to the table.The waitress has explained to us three times now that it was a very busy night and they had two groups of 25 people to serve. I'm not in the restaurant business but I'm fairly certain groups of 25 people don't show up unannounced and actually reserve in advance. So just plan ahead and make sure you have enough people to handle everything in the kitchen instead of just telling your customers it's taking 2 hours to open 12 oysters because there are too many people  in the room and you can't manage your fucking restaurant.

How was the service? Nice and slow... So you better get a good window seat to enjoy the view while waiting. I would say that it's better to go to the resto and get food and a complimentary view than just to go to the observation deck alone so I would say it's definitely worth a visit."

Service was quick and effective, good ambiance music and a stunning sunset (prepared yourself to see everyone taking pictures all the time, you'll probably end up in a picture too!)The food and drinks were unfortunately very average.  We got a ceasar, a contratto spritz and a margarita, they were very 're invented' but frankly the original way to do it is better or maybe if they were not going 'out of the path' too much.  We had salmon and beef tartare as entrées, it was not disgusting but didn't made us drool like we usually do when we get tartares.  I wanted to try the lobster spaghetti but it was no longer available so I took the kale&bacon mac&cheese and added lobster on it for 15$.  My partner took the grilled contre-fillet.  For my part the mac&cheese was soooo rich I could not eat it really, so I took my time and ended maybe eating 1/4 of it, and for the lobster, there was only 3 tiny pieces.  For the contre-fillet once again, nothing disgusting but just average, no particular taste except for tons of butter.  His fries never arrived so we asked our waitor for it and he was like 'ok I'll get you that quickly and I won't charge you for it'..but it is clearly indicated in the menu that it come with fries.  So the fries arrived and they were very tiny, like rough and dry broken pieces, not very yummy.  I overheard a client at another table complaining about the same issue.  We did not take dessert because I was not feeling so well from all the richness overlead of the mac&cheese and were a bit 'bummed out' of the series of event. I am attaching photos of the menu because it changes every once in a while so you'll be able to see the summer 2017 seafood choices and such, as well as a picture of the fries and my mac&cheese."

The lunch menu isn't incredibly extensive, but they have a little bit for everyone. We very much enjoyed the warm bread that was served to the table (twice!)

The view is nice but ultimately lost in a tidal wave of claustrophobic mediocrity.  All in all, the only purpose served by this sad excuse of an establishment is to demonstrate why most people would do the world a favor by eating at their desks.  Makes me miss the days of club 737..."

By that time we were starving so we told him we'd order food as well but he said he'll come back for our food order once he serves our drinks... about half an hour later... The cocktail menu is really nice though with a few good surprises, e.g., a bloody Mary with local alcohols yeah and some nice mocktail options.When our food finally arrived, around 8pm, I was so hungry I kinda just shoved it down. I took a lamb and goat cheese burger with fries... The lamb was overcooked and untasty, the goat cheese simply mushy and the fries... well. I have no words to describe the fries as they were probably the worst fries I have ever eaten.Yes, the view is great, even when it's dark and snowing. But for anyone who has walked up Mont-Royal, it's nothing you can't see there for free.So my advice, go there for the view, grab a cocktail, enjoy it, then go eat elsewhere. The food is not worth the price and neither the (lack of) service and the view make up for that."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,If you want the chance to experience a meal with a view then Les Enfants Terribles is the place to come. The restaurant is located on the 44th floor of Place Ville Marie in what used to be the 737 night club and you can expect 360 views of the city.  There is an express elevator from the lobby that gets you to the 42nd floor and from there you take a second one to get to the 44th floor.  There is also a terrasse for the warmer months.  I had seen the other Yelp reviews about the service so I was apprehensive about that but for the most part the service was pretty good despite the fact that the restaurant was packed for the lunch rush.  The service may have been a bit on the slow side at certain points during the meal but it wasn't as bad as others have described.  As a side note if you intend to come at lunch be sure to reserve because the restaurant is full then with the office crowd.  Now let's talk food.  I was starving so I went for a soup and one of their daily specials as part of the table d'hote.  On this particular day the soup was a cream of spinach soup which would have been good had it not been so salty.  That was followed by a shrimp and arugula salad with yoghourt dressing and you know how that turned out?  More salt!  It's a real shame because in both cases it overpowered the other flavours of the dish and if they just used less they probably would have been more enjoyable.  You can always add salt after the fact if need be but once you've added too much during the preparation of the dish there is no going back.When talking about the price the restaurant is a little too expensive for my liking.  I get that they have prime real estate but if you're going to be charging high prices the food better be good.  $21 for a salad is excessive in my opinion.  Sure there were shrimp in it but considering that it was pretty average it just wasn't worth the money.The view here is excellent but at the end of the day that alone is not enough for a restaurant.  Good food also factors into the equation and I find that here the experience is pretty average.  I would possibly come back for a quick drink and maybe some appetizers but I doubt I would return for a full meal.

/user_details?userid=9tIB6YlwKEVltePWXhBIzg,Deirdre C.,"Danville, NH",4 star rating,"We were in Montréal for a couple of days with some family. After reading reviews and the menu prior to getting into town, my husband and I had originally decided not to try this restaurant. The menu was not his thing, nor my brother's... both are gastronomically challenged, i.e. no frou frou twists with their meat and potatoes. As we were walking around the shops at Place Ville Marie, my husband made an executive decision. This was our 15-year old niece's first visit to Montréal and he wanted her to experience dining at the highest restaurant in the city with the most spectacular view. That did not disappoint! This really is more of a three star adventure, but we had good, attentive service overall and the view makes everything that much better, earning that fourth star. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday, so not too busy and didn't have to wait for a table. However we were five and the hostess put us at a table of four, meaning one person had to sit at the end, abutting into the table behind us. And the new/old 60s style plastic chairs with metal slider bases did exactly that on the concrete floor. Guess she noticed we were struggling a bit and came back to ask if we would like a bigger table. Yes, please. New table for six was a big improvement, with wooden chairs. And right at the front looking out to the rooftop terrace. Bit cool and breezy so only a couple people out there. We had a choice of sparkling or still water to start. Still tasted like tap water poured into an old wine bottle, but sparkling came from a fresh bottle. My sister-in-law wanted some red wine. They don't have merlot, but the waitress asked what she likes and then made a recommendation. Apparently it was quite acceptable, because she had two glasses. The guys had their beloved Cokes, but I tried one of the mocktails: jus de vie. It was very refreshing. Came in a big bowled glass which actually needed two hands to hold. Felt like a kid not able to hold their sippy cup safely. LOLWe opted to get the homemade charcuteries to start. Usually my husband loves smoked meat, but this did nothing for him, not even salami which he is partial to. Ended up that us three ladies polished it off. The pickled veg (cauliflower, beans, onion slices) were best part. For entrées... my brother found a simple burger and fries so he was happy. Hubby had the 8oz flank steak and seemed quite satisfied. The girls both had the seared salmon on red quinoa. Gee, it looked good. Wished I had chosen it too but the menu said there was grapefruit, which I can't have because of medication. When I saw it was just used as garnish, I kicked myself. I ordered what was supposed to be rosemary and lemon Cornish hen with chanterelles and baby potatoes. Pity my hen was missing the herbs and ended up being a plain old mini roast chicken. I missed when our new waitress came by to check on us (think there was a shift change) or I would have said something. It was fine, just not what I had expected. Was it a language issue when I ordered, and said I'll have the Cornish hen, did she think I didn't want the rosemary and lemon? I should have been specific. It took a very long time for our meals to come out. I'm guessing the hen slowed things down. No room or time for dessert. We had a date to keep with Adele... :)"

The design is sober, maybe a bit to sober but that's just details. Let's be clear that the service from start to finish at ""Les Enfants Terribles"" is top notch and attentive. Even how they take care of children is to be commended. The staff makes you feel important and certainly not intrusive even if you do show up with kids, it is a brasserie after all...When we get to the food it becomes a little more ambiguous. The food is made from quality product that simply tastes fresh, you eat the food and you say to yourself, this is really good stuff. Where I felt disappointed was with he menu itself. Sur the bacon was delicious, but I can have thinly sliced bacon anywhere. Why not be different and hit me with a really thick slice of hand cut bacon, or hand crafted breakfast sausage. I mean does breakfast potatoes have to be fried? That's a diner workaround to go faster. How's about a hash brown made on the flat grill. The same with the Fish and Chips, the fries and everything else, it was all so cliché and been there done that. I mean by ordering the Sugar Shack breakfast I want to be blown away with something special. If Martin Picard can take Sugar Shack food and push up into the stratosphere of awesomeness, so can Les Enfants Terribles' chef I'm sure. No POW! No ZING! No cranial detonations. It missed some imagination, it missed some finesse, it missed some flair. It was like having a canapé of bread and pâté which is delicious in itself but it needed that little dollop of Port jelly to make it go POW! in your mouth.

For locals, it's a great place to take your out-of-town friends who do not have a picky palate. No matter what, don't order poutine, because it is not real Quebecois poutine. The eggs benny were  so-so in taste. The table next to ours had ordered a grilled avocado that actually looked very appetizing, but I can't  comment on the taste. If I were to come again with out-of-town friends, I would stop by for a drink, get a few pictures and move on to other touristy locations/better food options."

The food is average, nothing out of the ordinary as you would expect sadly! The service is great and the food comes out quickly! The French onion soup was pretty good but our burger was quite over cooked and the Poutine we got was very mediocre which was upsetting! The ambiance is nice and feels luxurious! As mentioned the views are worth the visit but the food is pretty average"
/user_details?userid=EqRCCutU2DwV0x3yp0Skhw,Donna V.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"So LabourDay Sunday brunch was spent with an awesome view..and thank goodness for the view because My friend and I waited over 40minutes for our food to be served ... and all we ordered were simple eggs Benedict ... Which came with a small jar of fruits (melons), breakfast potatoes and thats all... Nothing fancy... At the end of the service, our waitress Justine asked us whether we would like Coffee... My friend and I said yes... Only to find out that we were entitled to coffee all during breakfast (which is included with the meal) but was never offered earlier... Really disappointed... Especially since we made reservations a few days prior and made sure to show up hungry... The answer to our 'why did we have to wait sooo long? And are going to get comped* for something.. At least something?' ... our waitress:"" there is nothing I can do' ... Wow! Smh ..."

/user_details?userid=6otakazfnbMuc50rllyPDw,Athena I.,"Troy, VT",2 star rating,"Went out with a large group for dinner, ordered the rye lemonade alcoholic drink and to my dismay it was quite overly sweet, felt like I was drinking pure tangy sugar. Then as meal orders came around I ordered the fish & chips but as everyone received their orders mine never came. Finally when I inquired they brought it out to me a few minutes later, but not before everyone else was done eating. No apologies were made or offers of discount so that was kind of disappointing but understandable I suppose. The food was alright."

/user_details?userid=O9MEZWZnmJ_KTL5A9CUHzw,Azzah A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"In brief, been there three times, the food is ok, nothing special. The service is terrible, very very slow and got us the wrong order twice, once with drinks and another time with food, I had to wait for the right order to come, took them half an hour to produce an omelet!!!! by the time they served it ( hooray )I ate alone as everybody else finished their food!"

/user_details?userid=tFfJLqv79g_rMhali_vMgQ,Dorian K.,"New Orleans, LA",4 star rating,Good location and tasty food. A bit over priced but you're paying for the view. Overall a very nice experience I would recommend it.

I mean, I get it, you guys are busy and have a nice view but seriously? An hour and half later and the food came out cold and not that good"

Might be a small portion for those accustomed to ""construction breakfasts"" but imo was just the perfect balance for me to enjoy & indulge without feeling heavy afterwards!"
/user_details?userid=uikNxEMWaVYl1Tng7PYc0w,K G.,"Cedar Park, TX",4 star rating,Second time at this local establishment.  This time we went for the downtown location.  Did not disappoint.  I wanted to try something new but the shrimp salad I had the first go around was on the menu so I grabbed it and another half dozen oysters.  Good call as always.
/user_details?userid=uOM1bErusM6vPBGcvwgKkg,Kai N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Enfants terribles, c'est terrible! We were on the terrasse, no service. The waitress is the most rude person. Ordered Jameson drinks and it's diluted. I feel all is diluted. When we told the waitress, her response is that the batch is different from one to another. Wow! My suggestion, check out the view and go somewhere else. 100% tourist trap."

I ordered the omelette charcuterie it had no taste and tasted so much like eggs only no seasoning . The salad is only lettuce . No creativity. Worst food ever but the service is good and the view is nice . My sister took the jardiniers omelette it was disgusting
/user_details?userid=Bo8yNJ-0gJH18jPpz0wXJQ,Tamara M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If you're looking for a breathtaking view of Montreal this is the place to go! I've been here a couple of times either in small groups or to have a drink with a friend at the bar. After ordering from the menu for the first time it starts seeming slightly restricted in choice. They offer a small selection of appetizers, pastas, vegetarian, meat, fish and sides. This time around I ordered the ribs which come with a side of coleslaw salad and your choice of fries or salad. The meal was good but unfortunately nothing to rave about which is why I am giving it 3 stars. Personally, for a place in that location, the food should be up to par (not ro say that it is not good!)For a Tuesday evening it was a busy night, and the service lagged a little at the beginning (to order drinks and to get them) and towards the end (for the bill). The food however was brought quickly :)Overall I am giving this 3 stars only mostly because i think the food could be much better, but still a great choice to go for drinks and enjoy the summer days and a beautiful view of Montreal!"

I had a reservation. The service was inattentive and the carbonara we ordered was undercooked. Only thing good was the view, but it got cold outside (since it was 9 by the time they seated us) so we had to move inside. Will not be returning."

/user_details?userid=AM70Flc2QQ2Sd1oRAVczFw,Milia J.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",4 star rating,I must say that they upped their game.  I was with a group that was going there so had to go. The service was much better as was the food. I am guessing that they have been reading the negative comments and decided to grow. Oh and the Margaritas are amazing!
/user_details?userid=WgdozIRyj5St8VQ9it-j5A,Stuart A.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I've been multiple times because everyone wants to see the view from the top of this Montreal landmark. Great view. Great location. But garbage food. I've not had a good dish and haven't heard anything but bad reviews of the food.
/user_details?userid=YTXpugUXRvqRcuJVNxUiOw,Nicolas B.,"Kingsbury, NV",1 star rating,We tried getting a table at 5 o'clock. The restaurant was half empty and yet the lady still would not give us a table for four people. It's a beautiful restaurant but the staff is rude and you're better off going somewhere else.
/user_details?userid=TPlMF9zsShxCDbRRA8vp7A,Michel M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Great location right on top of the building roof terrace with beautiful panoramic views of Mount Royal and St. Helene island the dishes were very good although the flanked  steak was hard to chew and the knife was not sharpened drinks are amazing but the waiters need to work quicker but the place is highly recommended

/user_details?userid=vdxp6ZC834Jy8XnBrxt7Bg,Michael V.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,The elevators were a bit hard to navigate but it was worth it. Spectacular views. We came for a work lunch and sat at a corner table. The ambiance was fun and the staff was very good. Steak Tartare was high quality and the pasta Carbonara had a slight twist without straying too far. It was thankfully not over salted. Pudding Chomeur was the rich decadence it should be. And a decent espresso topped it off.
