Neither of us wanted wine for dinner and were a little disappointed with the limited beer choices. We each had a homemade pasta dish and they were good but not outstanding. Because we have travelled quite a bit in Italy, our expectations are rather high when an Italian restaurant advertises homemade pasta. Potions are are certainly adequate - after having a starter and pasta, we had no room for dessert."

The breakfast buffet is good with made to cook eggs and omelets, as well as being well stocked with the standard buffet-type delights; this is a great way to start the morning. The lunch and dinner menus are much more diverse with a good selection of Italian favorites and a good wine list. :)For dinner one night, I had a great meal.  I started with a mixed green salad and a fantastic ravioli dish!!!  The servings were portioned well and very tasty.  However, the dinner was made by an INCREDIBLE tiramisu!!!  WOW!!!  This is a great place to dine while staying at the fantastic, boutique hotel or simply passing by in the neighborhood!!!"

Phenom...Osso Bucco to die for, so is the Squid Pasta!  Keep up the good work Maiolos!"

We enjoyed excellent ravioli, pappardelle, salmon tartare, calamari, mussels and tiramisu. Decent wine list. Service was friendly, attentive and professional without making us feel rushed. We liked our outdoor table next to the hustle and bustle of Rue Sherbrooke. We'll be back!"
