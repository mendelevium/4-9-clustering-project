I had resigned myself to that living in St Henri meant we don't get good and affordable food anymore, and then came along Golden Thali. I've only ordered delivery from these folks but so far every time has been terrific. Honestly, they give even some of the classic Indian places (looking at you, Palais d'Ajit!) a run for their money.Because I'm a sucker for a good deal I've always ordered the thali- both the lamb and the butter chicken options are terrific, although I have a small preference for the butter chicken (I mean, who doesn't?). Down to the details: the portions are generous, the food is killer tasty, the naan is exceptionally fresh and they always include a half tandoori chicken leg in the meat thali. For $12.99 you can't beat it.My man friend is a bit more adventurous than me and tends to order Ã  la carte. While the vegan options are extensive with these guys, his favorite remains the eggplant bhartha.A couple added details that really make this place stand out: I don't know how but they always manage to put together our food faster than literally anywhere else we order from. Another detail worth mentioning is the mango chutney: given the option I'd probably bathe in that chutney, it's that good."

We had an UberEats promo, and we felt like ordering Indian food. Here we are to try Golden Thali. We made a buffet style; we got chicken biryani, shrimp biryani, paneer tikka, chicken tandoori, vegetarian thali and bunch of naan. Overall great delicious meals. It was flavorful. The best was the naan, with its freshness, it hits the right spot in your belly. Rightly recommended!"

I tried the chana masala, tardka dal, the eggplant dish and mixed vegetables, all made vegan for me by excluding the dairy, and they were packed with so much flavor! The tandoori roti was also quite delicious, and I'm yet to try other items of the menu.Definitely recommend this Indian restaurant!"
