/user_details?userid=uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"So glad we were introduced to this place! What an amazing boucherie, with all fresh, local meats and cheeses. We learned that they don't work with any distributors, and source all of their own products locally themselves. We tried a variety of meats and cheeses, and all were delicious (I think the smoked liver sausage was the crowd favorite--perfect amount of smoke and spicy). They also stock some local beers and a variety of tasty things, like honeys, syrups, jams and preserves, and more. If I lived nearby, I'd buy all of my meat and cheese here :)"

I like the environment.Will go back."

A beautiful and fresh Porchetta sandwich with a fruit beer in what looks to be a park in the summer time.  Then it all came back to me, I remember this summer, roaming the city looking for the best sandwiches, drinking beer in the streets and parks enjoying the weather and all the city has to offer.  I remember being very impressed with this butcher shop, whole animals from small local farms, various cheeses and delicious things. They had a food tour going when we arrived and the super friendly girl behind the counter still gave us some time and schooled us on the shop and recommended the Porchetta  sandwich...salty and all belly meat with spicy mustard, lettuce and some buttery spread that I don't remember but damn...that sandwich though, I'm going back immediately."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,Boucherie Lawrence is an homage back to old style butcher shops which were a common fabric of neighbourhood life 20-50 years ago. Nowadays these places (although some exist) have become more specialized and need to charge more money. This is due to the advent of mass grocery and Costco have taken over the lions share of the meat business. Offerings here are fresh cut (aged) meat. Loads of local bottled and canned products. A small selection of fresh dairy products and what I come for the cured saucisson. Last year I spent the month of June in France and developed a semi-addiction to cured saucisson. I'm not proud of it (hence my mom and doctor warn in moderation) but this is the best offering I have found in Quebec. Pork shop (available at your local IGA) does a fine version however it's just the bit more delicious here at Lawrence. Also purchased are bottles of St Leon maple syrup.  $25 a big bottle is a bit steep but it makes a wonderful gift or delicious in the morning on your pancakes or toast. Being in the heart of the Plateau then can cater to those who are willing to pay a bit more. I believe the meat shop is connected to Lawrence restaurant a few doors down which does a dandy brunch.

/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"The best smoked sausage I've had in my life. This butchery does it all. None of the processing, changing hands, going from distributor to distributor before getting to the front case. No, they do the chopping, slicing, grinding, stuffing all right here. I mean come on, how many times in your life do you go the the meat counter, and they're butchering a cold dead pig on the counter right in front if you. To me, I take it as a privilege. A privilege to be a customer. Our group got to try a few different meats and two kinds of cheeses. All of their cheeses a brought in local from the Quebec province. Samples of a local goat cheese and a sharp cheddar. I'm a fan of goat cheese, and this was melt in your mouth, full of subtle flavor. The after taste was more pronounced than I've ever tasted. But m, then again, I don't eat much local, living in Columbus. One of the meats we tried was a dark liver sausage. Forget what else was mixed in with the liver, but it was WONDERFUL! I hate liver. But this smoked (?) meat was the best. The smoked ham was excellent, too. None of that over-salted nonsense. Fennel sausage was the last, pink-colored, tasting. Also to die for. Really, everything here is so damn tasty. Highly bummed that I couldn't take home any meats, as the security officers at the airport would be the only ones to benefit."

Also good array of cheeses and other local food items.Stopped by with an incredible food tour.They have 2 restaurant right nearby because of the amount of product that they produce.
/user_details?userid=j73PV5oCS8KNuAz73PzCmw,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Loved this place!! We came here because of the Mile End food tour and it was my favorite stop!! We were given a cold cut and cheese platter. We had 2 types of Canadian cheese and 3 charcuteries. There were: the most delicious cooked ham I ever had, a fabulous spicy sausage slice, and an ever better liver sausage (that was very unique!). I also got a few of the salty caramel in the bucket near the register and I loved them!!"
/user_details?userid=lBIfa3INjAj_z2_amlnq3w,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Friendly staff and great sandwiches. The bread is nicely crisp with a good chew. We tried all four sandwiches and the unanimous favorite was the sausage and cheese. The banh mi was a close second. The porchetta and ham ones were good too but very one note.
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"I passed by at the end of day hungry and disappointed that they were out of the sandwiches I'd heard about, but when I asked the owner for suggestions on what I could eat asap she immediately said: ribs. Yes. One bag of smoked ribs to go please. The bag cost $12 and she threw in a full loaf of sourdough bread. Let's stop for a second and talk about how hard it is to find actual sour dough in Montreal. It ain't easy to get the proper sour flavour you taste in SF and think about for ages afterwards. But the boucherie bread is perfect. It's certainly not what they're all about (the sausages! the steaks! oh my!) which makes the perfection of it all the more noteworthy and appreciated. The ribs though the ribs - dry smoked, sweet with a crackling heat... ideal for picnics."
/user_details?userid=RHAPKdSaO9B5wY7wDvhaYg,Annette M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"The charm of a butcher shop and patissiere as if you were in France.  The Canadians really are a class act culture. They take pride of their heritage and the cuisine is based on using farm to table concept and waste not.Boucherie Lawrence was part of a cultural & foodie walking tour while in Montreal. This is my favorite stop.  From the meats, cheeses,pastries and seasoned nuts, all were of high quality. Fresh is their middle name. They also have a selection of maple syrups and honey.  Pastries looked so decandent, too bad I was still full from the other stops.  But I made sure I bought the cheddar cheese and maple syrups.Get here and make a stop.  You'll really want to!  The butchers are friendly and helpful. And of course, the place is immaculate!"
/user_details?userid=sbWWWi3JRE7s-OPUzGmCYA,C S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We popped in after eating at Lawrence a few doors down. I'm a sucker for a good butcher shop - and this place is the real deal. They have a great selection of various cuts of meat, including terrine and rilletes, and they also carry a number of specialty goods. While we didn't get anything because we were visitors of Montreal - I know a good meat shop when I see one, and would recommend this place for both locals, or visitors looking to smuggle meat across the border. Just kidding........."
/user_details?userid=mzXDuhZBPdHfMIk1YXP0mQ,Kendrah R.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Damn expensive.  Damn good.  Yes the meat is the star of the show, but I can and did go on for about ten minutes singing the praises of their hot dog buns. Thanks to my husband for having the patience to endure my diatribe.   How can hot dog buns be that good?  I have no idea but kudos to the gods and goddesses at Boucherie Lawrence.  Kicking myself for not buying a dozen.We got a bunch of charcuterie to eat in the car on the drive back to Philadelphia.  I only wish they had displayed more prominently their sandwich options.  It was not until we paid and were leaving that we saw a small board above the cooler with them listed.  Will have to try them on our next go round.  Great place to get jarred and canned food gifts too."

/user_details?userid=hzd6NnHtrNTRvYZEb92dPw,Travis J.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"One of the best butcher shops I've been to in the world and definitely one of my favorite places I've ever been in Montreal. This is my new happy place. They have an amazing selection of quality meats, sausages, breads, spreads, syrups, saucissons, sandwiches, sweets, and more. The people who work there are knowledgeable  and super friendly and honestly made me want to open up my own butcher shop in Miami because we don't have anything of this caliber back home. Can't wait to be back in MTL to try more from them soon. Thanks Aaron!"
/user_details?userid=P-qkBhjs4mkSE5JC-wTwOA,PB F.,"Riverside, CA",3 star rating,"I came in looking for some simple, plain, salt-free white meat. But I should have known that this was not the place to go for that... Boucherie Lawerence oozed modern-day hipster. Lumbersexual. Beards 'R Us etc. Don't get me wrong though - very polite, courteous and professional staff. Amazing customer service.If you are on a salt-free phase of your diet, don't come here. There were a lot of things that had rubs on them, salted, aged, sausages. There were some bread products as well as some cookies/pastry things. I blocked it out since I am on sugar free and reduced carb. Also, don't come here without a thick bank account. Seriously. I understand the products are local and pure, but it just hurt. Even the BOUCHERIE LAWERENCE cool-person totes were expensive. I mean, I guess everything is expensive in this day and age. Inflation happened at some point."

Lovely, delicious, fresh both meats, bread and condiments. I had chorizo with cabbage. Loved it. My husband enjoyed his, too, and we certainly have different taste in food.Will be back for meat to cook at our rental flat around the corner."
/user_details?userid=G_6xcHukYu5QpJJ3QdtBTw,Enzo M.,"Santa Monica, CA",5 star rating,"Love this place. Quality meat meets a swath of other goodies to round out the shopping experience. Includes offerings from Guillaume bakery (the choco peanut butter squares are dank, the donuts are killer and the caramels are for coffee), many local dairies and even very reasonably priced local seasonal Veg plus a host of artisan products like honey, maple syrup, various oils, granolas and what have yous. Oh yeah! There's beer, soda, sauerkraut, kim chi, butter, bones for the dog or the soup, it's just great.And I haven't even talked about the meat yet. I get all my bacon and sausages here on a weekly basis and occasionally treat myself to pork chops, lamb burgers and sometimes go for the terrines as well. Their cured meats are all fantastic as well.Of course, quality comes with its price, but when it comes to meat, this is a return in itself. Not to mention the ever agreeable experience of shopping there, compliments of the dedicated and courteous staff.If you go in for only one thing, make it the back bacon."
/user_details?userid=29K-usmZfVDeIaQ85EG54A,Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"A very interesting chacuterie place, with a strong emphasis on local products (including piggies) and selling only the top notch quality products. As one of the last stops on our food tour, I can tell that my appetite had already weaned, but I just could not resist a tasting board. We had multiple kinds of cheeses, spiced sausages, and salami, and thin cuts of pork, perfectly prepared with an air of mastery over cured meats. The staff were very friendly and I only wish that I could speak a little more French to converse with them about their products."

Price ranging from $8-$10. Tried them all, none disappoint. Amazing flavors, huge portion of meat, homemade condiments. Best quality best tasting definitely recommend. Also tried their beignets 3 flavors: vanilla, chocolate and lemon. Best beignets not greasy or overly sweet. Flavors are on point..so good! !"
/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montrealers are so lucky to have Boucherie Lawrence. I have been there a handful of times so I can comment on what we tried, we loved it all. Twice when I arrived they were just bringing in fresh piggies (head to tail) that were laid out on the huge table behind the counter. Then the boys start breaking them down. Oh the knife skills in play, fascinating to watch them work in plain view. Here's our take:The bacon - tried both back & belly. Hand cut thick slices, preferred belly as back was way fatter but both were so good compared to commercial bacon.Sausage sandwich with choucroute, cornichons, dijon on crusty roll was delicious. Sliced ham was so nice. Made wonderful sandwiches at home,Jerk chicken never had so good since MoBay, tried wings, 1/2 breast & drumstick. Great flavour, nice heat. Fresh, you cook yourself, chicken got crunchy sticky, was simply awesome.5 pound Pork shoulder was rubbed & slow roasted then pulled. Pork was so tender, flavour was amazing, best I've ever made or had!Italian sausages, only bought 2, everyone wanted more, so tasty.Freshly made rolls & burger buns - stock up as they freeze well & you will be happy they are on hand.Nanaimo bars tasted better than what I tried in Nanaimo. Thick, rich, just wonderful.Salted caramels - decadent treats. They sell out quickly. Also didn't last too long at home. $1.00 per.Spicy salty sweet nuts - mix of peanuts pecans walnuts maybe others. Addictive, my crack, can't stop until they are gone.Will be back again this week to try something new."

Saucisson and pâtés are excellent, interesting rotating selection of cheese from Quebec, perfect cherry tomatoes and out-of-this-world bread. Seriously, Lawrence's house bread beats Joe La Croûte, Guillaume and the likes.Obviously you can also buy meat there, even the unusual cuts, at a fair price.Strongly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=WHmabbfgdSW-JrOU9ePMrA,Natalie T.,"East York, Canada",5 star rating,"VIBE Imagine your dream butcher shop. It's spacey yes, but this is it. I do wish it had a bit more seating though. I ATE/THE GOODS This place is so much more than where you can get your meat. Not only can you get sandwiches but also a ton of baked goods and homemade lemonade. You can also buy lots of canned goodies too and printed Boucherie Lawrence bags. Super cute selection and nice merchandising. But we need to talk about the sandwich. Because holy crap, it is one hell of a sandwich! Forget the prosciutto and the ham. It's all about the cotechino. Wikipedia does a better job at explaining this than me: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co…I do know that BL has their cotechino in sous-vide as part of the process. It's a mix between a slightly sweet and slightly salty meat and with the pickles (not even sliced!), the mayo and the fresh made sour dough bread, it truly is a treat. Oh, and it's $8. It is one of the BEST sandwiches I have ever had. Top it off with knowledgeable and friendly service and voila! Repeat customer. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Where to go if you can't get into Lawrence for brunch. The thing is I could have gotten into Lawrence for brunch but this was a cheaper option. Quicker too!"

I honestly don't know what I would've done without this place, and I am not exaggerating. The staff remembers me, and what I like. They're friendly, professional, and generally enjoyable to have around. In fact, while looking for an apartment, I refused to look anywhere that was not in the area (plateau, mile end, etc).I did a lot of research, looking for the best quality meats, and food in general, because I have a lot of health issues and eating anything less than the best ruins me, so you can absolutely consider this place the best. It has no close seconds.One friend who had accompanied me to Boucherie Lawrence (everyone I bring becomes a regular client and fan), was near Mont-Royal metro and bumped into one of the butchers from Lawrence. They immediately said : ""you're Oliver's friend!"", and I thought that was yet another great little thing that showed how good the staff there is. I've run into some of the employees at concerts, out on the streets, in grocery stores, etc, and it's always a friendly experience.Absolument le meilleur boucher que j'ai eu la chance de trouver. Je cherche tout le temps pour la nourrite de la meilleur qualite, et Boucherie Lawrence et mon N#1! J'ai demenager plus proche de eu juste pour pouvoir y aller plus facilement.

/user_details?userid=coFjUcQ_z84LO77CR_n5Fg,Dane R.,"Asheville, NC",5 star rating,"I used to live in Texas, studied there for a while, and often you'd see these t-shirts that said ""F... you, we're from Texas"". I hated those at the time; such an ostentatious stupid macho display of bravado. Yet now I get what they were saying: we're proud of our ultra-conservative gun-toting abortion opposing gay-bashing redneckdom. Ok, I still hate those t-shirts and what they stand for, but the point is, when you have something you love, and that's as good or better than anywhere else, and in the aforementioned categories Texas was as good or better than anywhere else, you flaunt it. Montreal, atten-shun! You have in Boucherie Lawrence an artisanal butcher named Marc - a former stock broker who said ""screw this, I'd rather kill and dismember animals"", and who studied at the great Fleisher's in NYC - one of the great butcher shops in the world. Where else on this island do you get, when you ask for ground beef, a guy who goes into the meat locker, pulls out a side of dry aged beef, and starts carving what will be your ground beef off the chuck, cutting out the seams, and then grinding it bespoke to your order? And where else do they also have homemade sausage, crispy pigs ear, homemade rillette and pate, great local produce, and in general beautiful locally sourced meat, also in a hyper-clean and inviting space, with attention to detail all-around? That's right - you'd have to go back to Fleisher's in NYC to find anything like this anywhere near close to Montreal. But why would you go there, when you can get it here? Exactly, because of a growing number of places like this that completely kick ass, we could now safely say, ""F... you, we're from Montreal"", but for thankfully very different reasons than those in Texas."
