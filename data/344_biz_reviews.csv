/user_details?userid=AOuRea8Ay7QEJiKbYto_rw,Susan H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3 star rating,"A very good experience. Service was helpful and available. Once we ordered our food came to the table FAST. The quiche was good (and the reason for the 3 instead of 4) but not great because the crust was soggy - I get it if the base is soggy but the back/end side? The egg, ham, cheese all very nicely balanced. The salads were fresh and flavorful with nice vinaigrette dressings. The tuna tartare was displayed beautifully and gave a mouthful of flavor. The ""cup"" of lattes come served in a clear glass glass with a napkin wrapped around - nice presentation and quality coffee."
/user_details?userid=oxkRQJo0LXw9owd90CKQQw,Cindy W.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Holder was an amazing dinner experience! Service was great (our meal did end up taking about 2 hours bc it got so busy) and staff was very kind. I would definitely recommend making a reservation here on your next trip to Montreal!Ordered the seared foie gras and calamari as appetizers and they did not disappoint! The sweetness of the gingerbread and the dried fruit paired really well with the richness of the foie gras. And this calamari isn't like your typical gummy/ chewy calamari you find at normal restaurants. It has a nice crunch and you can taste the freshness of the seafood.For mains, we ordered the beef cheek, which was super tender, the duck confit ( meat fell right off the bone, and the salad was well- dressed and not soggy with dressing), lobster ravioli (nothing special, probably would try something else next time since the truffle taste was not as strong as I hoped), and the special which was some kind of steak with fingerling potatoes (great sauce and meat was well cooked).This dessert was a great way to end the meal. Nice tartness from lemon and well balanced with not overly sweet marscapone cream!"

We ordered calamari, pate, and I personally got the braised beef cheek.Calamari was fresh, crispy, and well seasoned. Pate was supposedly good but it isn't my cup of tea so I can't actually comment on it.The braised beef cheek was delicious. The meat was incredibly soft. My plate was clean at the end of the meal. The staff was also very attentive and pleasant."
/user_details?userid=vR222pa4rVRueZwCbAoOFA,Elias F.,"Buffalo, NY",4 star rating,"This place is always busy and consistent, the food is pretty good, traditional french cuisine. The service is excellent and very attentive. I don't think my cup was ever empty as they have a lot of staff on. They have a great and fresh tartare I would encourage everyone to try as an appetizer it's delicious. The duck confit was a little bit over done but still rather good, not the best I've had but over all well done. Their deserts are also delicious. I have been back several times and would highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=l133MthZ-NDhxNM-09QMMA,Justin C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"We had to switch up reservation our plans a few hours before dinner. Enter Holder. Holder has good Yelp reviews and the 2 people at the hotel recommended it on different occasions. Excellent dinner. They accommodated our party of 6, including two small children. It was a birthday dinner and the food was fantastic. Tilapia with saffron and shrimp and Muscles: Great dish and has some kick. The portion was decent, as well. Overall, I really enjoyed this dish. Salmon: I was told was great. Those who had it enjoyed it immensely. Duck confit: Very good. Another well prepared dish. They did a birthday dessert with a candle. Prior to dinner we got to pick which dessert she'd like. We went with the Lemon cream and mascarponne mousse,crumble, coconut sherbet -- She loved it.  I don't remember whether they comped the dessert but it was amazing. Final Word: Excellent restaurant for dinner."

The person I spoke with was accommodating but advised he needed the table back in 90 minutes vs the usual 2-2.5 hours. I went with a friend on a strict gluten free diet, and we were both glad we picked this restaurant! She was impressed with our very patient server and qide range of gluten free options, while i was impressed with their food quality including my very delicious cocktail. I ordered the beef cheek and it was so flavorful and tender...just heavenly. We were also not rushed despite being told we could only have our table for 90 minutes (we were there for close to 2 hours)."

We were quite excited as they had really been wanting to introduce us to this restaurant. The husband ordered the French Toast & I ordered the Goat Cheese & Tomato Omelette with their side of potatoes. Husband loved his meal. Service was excellent. Very friendly & efficient. However my omelette had a hair in it. We told the server about it and they took the food away and offered to replace it. But the idea of a hair, from someone's body disgusted me to the point that I couldn't eat anything else or any more. They didn't add this particular item to our total bill but sometimes a meal getting ruined and you going hungry isn't really worth any money."
/user_details?userid=U6wBHCCbf-qtyeM3spjmVg,bob t.,"Lemont, PA",1 star rating,"(I found the restaurant through Yelp, so I feel obliged to report back.  This review cost us far more than $700 and important lost professional opportunities.    The positive reviews are very possible, but the negative reviews are also very possible here. Their mistake which was not a mistake but deliberate error had impacts that we cannot be compensated for.)Sometimes you get one chance to make a good impression or to do your job.  On the night we went, Holder restaurant failed. Service was over an hour late, obvious fixes to this were ignored (e.g., run appetizers out first).  Our early meal turned into a late meal. 2.5 hours turned into 3.75 hours.  The extra time, perhaps lack of food, perhaps the extra bottle of wine that had to be ordered, allowed a party member to turn into an ass.  Post-dinner meetings had to be abandoned.  The compensation of a glasses of port was very kind, but at $60 for the glasses was far short of the time and opportunity that was lost, of $1000 in time (the table had some senior people at it with a much higher hourly rate than the food charges), and post dinner meetings were important ones to arrange funding for projects that could not be arranged that evening or even on this trip. We were socially stuck, we could not just get up and leave.  Service were not slow, it stopped.  There were apologies, but I'm noting that in this case, these apologies were simply not enough and upon reflection could not be enough.  If they refunded the entire bill it would not compensate us.  This service lead to a discussion about 1-star restaurants and consistency.  While the food was pretty good, tending to great, and the server was smart, kind, apologetic, the organization above her either did not plan or did not care about us.  There were long lines of servers at the kitchen waiting for food for long periods of time.  She noted a large party, which I saw had been arranged in a silly 15-20 person per side table, may have been the cause.  They were locals.  So?  There was a large table.  Apparently it not only got priority, but slowed the whole process down.  Another explanation might be some sous chef was off or walked out. I could have given it two stars or more for the food and server, but I think you now know what I really think.  I can't recommend it, and as they correctly guessed with that quality of service, will not be back and would not be able to come back (oh, I had other dinner meetings that week as well, but won't be back).  I'm left with an example to share that you can take advantage of tourists, even in a nice restaurant.  And, I now have to explain why the bill was so high to my manager.   I would go somewhere your hotel recommends if you have to count on a restaurant to host a meeting dinner.  also, it appears that Holders has paid to have the rating summary turned off.  Yeah!tl/dnr: one of the most disastrous restaurant experiences I've had."

The food was ok, presentation was nice but Lacked the richness and flavor I expected or hoped for. Service was most disappointing.

Ordered the vegetarian pasta with coconut sauce- just meh.  Very underwhelmed with the entire experience.Ps... didn't appear to be accessible.  What is this 1980?!"
/user_details?userid=FRKnLBnlFiasr1Dc8oOIGQ,Sarah G.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Opting for a French Brassiere in Old Montreal, Holder was the perfect choice. Both charming and lively.On a Thursday at lunch Holder caters to a corporate/business clientele and when we went, the restaurant was packed. The menu is on the pricer side but reasonable in retrospect for the high quality cuisine. We all enjoyed our meals (French onion soup, beef tartare,  chicken liver, beef cheeks), however, goat cheese appetizer was miniature in size and nothing special."
/user_details?userid=6i1WBZOGbTPb0Pq5lGMhlg,Kelly W.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"If you are in Montreal, you must include this restaurant on your list of spots to visit. First, the service was amazing and so friendly. I never felt like I was being ignored and the place was packed. They made me feel like I was the only guest in the entire place and I was eating alone! Now for the ford....I can't say enough. It was some of the most delicious I've ever tasted. I started with an espresso martini and the French onion soup. The soup was so well prepared and delicious that I might not be able to order it at another restaurant ever again! For my main dish, I ordered the duck confit. It was amazing! It was so tender and the flavors were to die for....seriously. It was served over a generous bed of arugula with some fingerling potatoes.I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be returning during my next visit to Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Sweet serenity! Dessert menu my God...For the fellow foodies I don't have to even make an introduction with Holder in fine dining. This venue never has failed to please my palatte. I took a different twist this time an tried the dessert menu to share: profiteroles (3 pieces) that had a vanilla ice cream filling painted with chocolate syrup ****; a salted caramel Lava cake with a side of butterscotch icecream*****+ which was simply divine! It had a consistency of a warm muffin topped with melting  butter! I also had a side of mint tea that complimented nicely with my sweet selection. Each dessert priced around 10$. Always a pleasure to come back!!!
/user_details?userid=iLIGDMatmuGPGELLFlPXdw,Jess M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Holder was an excellent dining experience! The ambience and decor of the restaurant is lovely and was not very loud. We came on a Sunday evening and found it to be not too busy. Our waiter was attentive and kind. We ordered salmon tartare which was tasty. They provide bread for the table which was sooo good warm and crispy! As our main courses we had the steak + frites (good), lobster ravioli (decadent) and the Tilapia Special Dish of the evening (great). Dessert was pleasantly larger portions (not complaining) - all were delicious; Crème brûler, chocolate mousse and Yoghurt parfait. Would recommend this restaurant for romantic dinners, business meetings and friend catch ups.Une merveilleuse expérience chez Holder! Je vous suggère de prendre le ravioli et de essayer tout les desserts! Miam!!"

We were 1 hour early for our reservation but were seated promptly without issue.  The wait staff were courteous and prompt.  I ordered classic beef tartare and duck confit while the family ordered goat cheese and foie gras for appetizers, and for dinner they ordered braised beef cheek, lamb Shepard pie and lobster ravioli.  We were all impressed with our food.  Perfectly portioned and of course tasty.  Wife and kids wrapped up the perfect meal with creme brûlée's, Bulgarian yogurt and chocolate cake."
/user_details?userid=towpACt4pwuCrKL0mh93fg,Joel A.,"Wilmette, IL",4 star rating,"Ahh our last night in Montreal.  Holder is a solid 4 star dining experience.  The ambience is spacious, well-designed, urban.  The staff is neat looking (unlike Lea Deux Gamins) and knowledgeable and the clientele is primarily business (my guess) and a mix of tourists.  The menu is diverse and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The wine list was comprehensive and had a number of wines by the bottle or glass (we had a nice bottle of Malbec for CAN $50).  I started dinner with fish soup, a dish I haven't had in years.  It was delicious.  My wife had a mixed greens salad--fresh, large enough for two to share and well-dressed.  We each had the hanger steak frites (CAN $27), which was prepared as we ordered.  The frites were very good (better than Modavi) as were the sides of rapini and mushrooms.  By the time we finished we had no room for dessert (but they looked lovely!).  Overall a solid dining experience."

I had the duck and it was nicely cooked. We had the profiteroles for dessert. My only wish was that the menu said what the profiteroles were filled with. I was expecting pastry cream or whipped cream but it was ice cream, which is fine, but would have been nice to have been noted on the menu."
/user_details?userid=bzXV7ND1de-dZtHwDdWXEg,Nick C.,"Santa Monica, CA",5 star rating,"Everyone at my table absolutely loved their meal at Holder! We started with the amazing warm goat cheese and delicious mussels (an entree that we chose to get as an appetizer). I had the braised beef cheek was very flavorful and so tender. Also, the lamb shepherd's pie was very noteworthy as well--the lamb was pulled not ground which I thought was a wonderful choice. I would definitely come back again!"

/user_details?userid=UxHMQ8Lg_g8kk9Q5IAWuGA,Luchang Z.,"Cleveland, OH",5 star rating,Yummy French food! I got the duck confit and it was amaaaaaazing. The combination of duck/arugula salad/ and some potato bites was just unbelievable. The skin of the duck is so crispy and the meat is very tender. My bf ordered the beef cheek (I forgot the name) but literally the meat melts in your mouth... you won't regret it. One thing that I didn't enjoy was the French onion soup. Perhaps I like salty food but the dish was just too light for me... But I am giving this place a five because everything else trumps the soup. Treat yourself :)
/user_details?userid=FFFeLM5rk29RZn6FmGlHYQ,Geraldine G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a solid space in the old quarter of Montreal.Spot on with customer service. Whether you speak english or french.It's truly a modern, but yet old world French feel. It has a typical look I've seen in many french themed restaurants. We came here for brunch. I ordered a quiche made of spinach, gruyere and mushroom which came with a side salad. It was delicious and I craved more. Always a good sign when you want more.Would I go here again? Maybe.  It's not that the food wasn't good or the space wasn't clean or modern. IT just lacked a joie de vie.  It felt a little sterile at times but it doesn't mean the space isn't welcoming. I certainly recommend it."

Impeccable service and probably the best old fashioned I have ever had. Most of my friends got the veal steak, but they all preferred the salmon once they tried my dish.

/user_details?userid=Wn_-RcqyIGm_T4f8zyP2QQ,Marcus C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",5 star rating,"Five stars all around!Food: the beef cheeks were so tender! Highly recommended! The tilapia was extremely well seasoned with amazing flavor. The French Onion Soup was lighter than most, which was great for me; most French Onion Soups in this town are way too salty. The dessert that required a fifteen minute wait was decadent! The ice cream under the cookie was so unique in flavor that I wish I could bring a tub of it back home! The one Rose that they had tasted great, too, but might not have been worth that amount of money; wish the wine glasses were larger!Service: this place might have the most efficient wait staff in all my adventures in Montreal. My water glass was was always full, there was plenty of bread, and food was ready in more than reasonable time.Decor: the bar is stocked from ground to ceiling with wine bottles and other alcohol. Everything is placed so high up that the bartender needed a ladder. Awesome experience! I hope to return!"
/user_details?userid=JjrpeIkmuhk9Ab_5HEsqyw,Judy H.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried it last August (2015), and it was that great that I had it again, as my last dinner in Montreal!! From the outside, it looks like a business building, but inside it has a nice ambiance, without too much decor. The servers were friendly and got what we wanted in a timely manner. Happy:  The menu is mostly French inspired and selective. If you go to the washroom, you can see the open kitchen. I ordered the duck confit with potatoes and a bed of arugula salad which is a nice touch with all the meat I'll be eating. The duck meat was tender and came off the bone which I like. The portion was enough for dinner and leaving some room for dessert. For dessert, we shared a lemon cream with mascarpone cheese and coconut sorbet. Our second time!! Not happy: None that I can think of. Even the washroom is clean and bright. A bonus! Verdict:  Been here twice since I am not from Montreal. So it means - I'll be back in the future!!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had their Confit de canard, pommes de terre rattes roquette, vinaigrette truffée. Price is ok.  However, the duck very oily so the bed of arugula was completely soaked in oil. I think they could've patted off some of the oil before serving. Ambiance is a bit noisy at night so it's great for groups maybe not if you're trying to have an intimate dinner."
/user_details?userid=8oDB6mhtccdTy3O66PmxhA,Mike H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Montreal is really an amazing food city. While my stay here was short, virtually every meal that I had here was top notch, and this one was no exception. With two friends, we ordered three entrees and a couple of things to share:Soupe de poisson (fish soup): this is a creamy fish soup topped with chopped chives, served on the side with rouille (a breadcrumb and garlic based sauce), gruyere cheese, and a crouton. The fish stock is strong, and while the fish was pureed, the texture of the fish is still present in the soup. This was an excellent appetizer, especially as a precursor to my fish entree.Steak tartare: the (in)famous raw beef dish loved by many. Ours came slightly spicy and garnished with a crouton and sprouts. Really, really delicious. Meat was well seasoned, and the spiciness level was perfect. Would eat an extra full portion of this if I had the time. Highly recommend anyone who haven't had the dish before to give this a try.Pan fried monkfish: monkfish filet served mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus, and a demi-glace. Presentation was simple but elegant, and and everything paired together very nicely.Grilled veal strip steak: steak topped with Bearnaise, and served with a mixed mushroom risotto. Again, simple presentation, but rich and delicious. Veal was cooked medium rare and remained moist, with a nice and slightly crispy exterior. Beautifully done.Duck confit: a classic French dish made using duck legs preserved in duck fat, then served pan fried with fingerling potatoes over a bed of arugula tossed in a white truffle dressing. The dish is flavor overload, as the duck is extremely rich in flavor and virtually immersed in fat. If you like duck and strong flavors, this is the right dish for you.We were so stuffed we did not have room for dessert. Overall, this was simply a lovely restaurant serving up French classics. Service, by the way, was excellent, and our server was both attentive and humorous, adding to this delightful experience."

/user_details?userid=ylpWc3hukBIHpGhqqboT5w,Maria A.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Lobster ravioli for dinner. Chocolate mousse for desert. I paid for the richness of my meal the next morning but it was absolutely worth it.The raviolis were rich.  The lobster filling the perfect amount of filling. The truffle sauce was decadent.  I think there were 7 on my plate. I offered one to my dinner mate and almost regretted it after realizing that was one less I had to enjoy. I soppped up the extra sauce with the bread.The chocolate mousse was decadent. I could only eat half because it was so rich. Servers were all super nice.  Gorgeous dining room.  Would definitely come back here again.
/user_details?userid=uLkpc2NFLoUARyLy9IWftg,Maggie L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Made dinner reservations for 6:30pm on a Saturday and was warmly welcomed by a handsome, energetic fellow upon arrival.  The restaurant was fairly large, but it was rather empty for a Saturday night.  We were seated at a table for two by the window, next to an enormous pot plant that towered over our heads, literally.  I didn't mind it so much because it was on top of my fiancé's head rather than mine, plus it added a special touch to the decor, and him :)We started off our meals with the foie gras w/ pear chutney and the endive & watercress salad, both of which were pretty tasty and fresh.  Our entrees, the braised beef cheek and duck confit, required a bit of a wait, which was confusing given that not many customers occupied the restaurant, but they were decent, just not WOW.  We both felt that the braised beef cheek, although very tender, was a bit salty and on the saucy side.  The duck was also a tad dry, a big no-no for duck confit.Service was pretty attentive as our glasses were continuously refilled with water (It was hot out and we chugged them like we were in a desert).  The wait staff was also very friendly, shown through their smiles and cheerful demeanors.All in all, it was a pretty good dinner but forgettable.  Nonetheless, if I was a Montreal resident, I would probably return for a meal."

My tea came first and then after a wait of 10-15; my food came and to my surprise, I was fascinated by the colours, flavours and presentation of that plate. The buns were perfectly moist with the eggs Benedict sauce on it as well as accompanied with a strawberry joy with it. I enjoyed it. I was so full and they have an amazing crew as well. All good things at the holder and definitely not my last time here as I'd return for sure! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to all if you like an amazing brunch place.

Service was horrible. When we first arrived, there was no hostess or anyone available to seat us. There was coat check but no one offered to take our coats. Once seated we did not get any water until we called the hostess to call the server over for us to order. The server was never around to provide us any service. We asked a few questions regarding the menu but the server wasn't really informative or helpful. When the food arrived they just place it on the table with out explaining the dish. I'm not sure if that was normal but all the restaurants I go to in this range usually explain the dish and what's inside. The server also never excused himself when he reach over us or come by with utensils and plates. I felt that this was really impolite. Even when he was clearing the table, he held the plates with a bunch of knives right in front of my boyfriends face at eye level. As for pay. The bill was tossed on the table. The credit card machine was firmly left on the table too even though the server knew that we were ready to pay. The server never handed anything to us nicely. Not sure why he was so rude but it's really unprofessional. The food was okay but the service ruined our mood. We ordered the foie gras, it was nicely seared. The sauce that came with it complimented the foie gras well. But the gingerbread wasn't our thing. The Duck Confit was crispy in the outside (skin) and pretty soft on the inside (meats). The meat fell off the bone easily. The flavour was okay but it was a bit dry. It came on a salad with potatoes. The beef cheek was really soft. Flavour was okay but it was really salty. It came with some green beans. Overall, the restaurant was nice, food was decent. Nothing exceptional. Service was horrible."

I came to visit fora work conference and wanted to try French/Canadian cuisine. The hotel recommended this spot and I decided to give it a try. Decor: Upon walking in the restaurant is spacious and beautiful. There is huge windows to sit by to people watch while eating. We got to see horse carriages walk by which was great! Food: Superb! The free baguette bread is delicious and French. We had two baskets because it was so delicious. Everything everyone was ordering around us looked delicious. We ordered the chicken liver and warm goat cheese as an appetizer. Great sharing portion and very delicious. For entrees we got the Cajun tilapia which was fresh and seasoned to perfection. The steak frites was cooked well served with grilled onions and fries. My boyfriend are the entire plate!Service: all the servers and managers were extremely nice and attentive! They had no problem translating the menu and offered great explanations! If you are visiting I would def recommended this spot!

He also will be looking into who the server was which is appreciated. I was very excited to come and try this place. I've heard lots of good things. This is why my first and last experience here was such a massive disappointment. Prior to coming I took and look at the menu online and made my dinner choice, we were 8 adults and 4 kids. I was informed upon  entering the restaurant that there was a child's menu which I was happy about. We were seated and then handed a set menu because we were more than 10 people. I explained to the hostess that the kids were ordering from a set menu and asked if I could get the full menu. He refused even though the rest of the party was fine and was placing orders based on their set menu. I ordered a coffee. My husband ordered the flank steak, it came raw. We asked that it be cooked, when it came back it went from a 7oz portion to a 3 oz portion, now Im not a pro chef but I do cook and there is never that much shrinkage. When the waiter was asked he simply said it was always that size. The rest of the party didn't rave about the food either, maybe it's all the hype that we expected something out of this world. To make it worst, we asked another waiter to bring us napkins and he let us know he wasn't the waiter but he would get it anyway. When our waiter was at our table he proceeded to tell or waiter to take care of us cause we're pains in the ass and are constantly asking him for things. Super unprofessional. We won't be back."

I enjoyed the lobster ravioli but it was not the most filling of the meals for its high price tag. My friend however said that the Duck was really good. The prices were higher than other restaurants in the area and the waitress blatantly stared over our shoulder as we left the tip on the handheld payment machine.

Reasonably priced wine list with good number of selections too.We shared a few appetizers which were all very tasty and well presented - endive and watercress salad, chicken liver pâté and beef tartar.I rarely take salmon at the restaurant, but I went for it based on our waiter's recommendation and it was outstanding, great flavor.

It was certainly busy. It is supposed to be a traditional French restaurant. Um, not so sure about that. Very Americanized in my opinion.My first complaint was our food came out way too fast. This tells me everything is pre cooked before you even order, then heated up.My husband had the vegetable soup, which came out cold.I started with the French Onion soup. It was too sweet and did not have enough onion taste.We went with the special, which was cod. This was a nice dish. The fish was perfectly cooked with a wonderful finish. It was served on a bed of Israeli cous cous, which complemented it nicely. If you are looking for a great French restaurant, this is not it. Not awful, but nothing to write home about."

Unfortunately it's not included during brunch which did not show up on he site when I originally did my research.  We had also tried to move our reservation to an earlier time but unable to do so..the only time offered was even later...however when we arrived almost an hour earlier than our reservation the restaurant was 90% empty.Note:  Sent a note to the restaurant because they asked for comments...in return got a rude response from the owner...might have tried to re-visit this restaurant but after this response that will never happen.  For what it's worth the French onion soup in Toronto is superior to what I experienced this weekend.

It's a lot so I would recommend getting the appetizer portion.Salmon: didn't try but my mother really enjoyed Warm goat cheese: good, but the only thing that didn't amaze us.

We were just walking and walking and my dad saw many people inside this place and asked if we could go there. Well, of course! We headed into the place and they had a full bar on the right hand side and they served lunch and brunch at the time when we got in. Food: I had duck confit like always and my parents and Calf 's liver. Both are delicious as hell. My duck confit is crispy outside but inside is warm and tendered. The only bad part is that it 's bit salty to me. But the saltines is quickly balanced with veggies and potatoes on the side. I did not try my parents' liver but they told me that it's delicious. Oh, and we had their soup, potato soup for the day. Very balanced and smoothly, I wish I could had another stomach to finish another soup.Service: Thank you for the good serve. As you know, I aint French speaking person. English is my second language and that's about it. I have no experience of speaking French at all so when I stepped into this place, I was little nervous. But the lady was bilingual and speak English well to treat us to a seat with window. In addition, when my parents got their soups faster than me, they came here and asked if anything went wrong and correct their delays for my soup.

She was more than willing to help us with directions to places in the area we needed to find. Not sure what the other reviewer who had an early dinner but rated the service poorly experienced but if it depended on the server explaining the dish that's a bit ridiculous as the menu has very good descriptions of the dishes so if he didn't know what he ordered, I'm not really sure what to say.Our food was delicious. Lobster ravioli and a salmon dish over a potatoes purée. The sauces and entrees were great. Flavors were well balanced and not overdone. Will definitely go back when we are back in town."

The restaurant has the perfect lighting and vibe for a first or second date. Unfortunately, I was traveling on business, but enjoyed myself over by the bar area. I gnashed on the lovely selection of toasted breads and salted butter they brought out while I drank a local red ale. I asked the server for his recommendations and decided upon the braised beef cheek à la bourguignonne, which is braised for six hours. The meat literally just fell apart in my mouth it was so tender. The dish was also perfectly sized so that I was full but not overly so. Thanks for a lovely evening!"

We went there for dinner, and bolder did not disappoint.  As a matter of fact, every element fell perfectly into place.  We arrived around 700pm Saturday night and were seated at a high top bar table. The waiter was great.  Friendly, but not too chatty at all. Perfect. I had the braised beef cheek, which must have been some of the best beef I've ever had. She had the canard (duck) con fit. We had fois gras for an appetizer, and chocolate creme brule for desert.  All elements were literally 10/10.  Absolutely perfect.  Well done holder.  You were the best restaurant of the trip, and one of the best I've been to in my life."

The space is a bit loud, but not unbearably so. The decor is a nice blend of old world style and sharp modern lines.In giving the place five stars, I must admit that I had recently eaten meals featuring duck hearts, sea snails, and bone marrow, so I was ready for a hearty, more classic bistro meal.First, I ordered the Country Seasonal Vegetable soup (around 8$). It was the best vegetable soup I have ever eaten at a restaurant- perfectly balanced flavour that was not too salty, spicy, or bland.For my main course I had the steak and frites (around 21$). The steak was perfectly cooked and flavourful. The frites were blessedly not overcooked or oversalted.Dessert featured several options. I chose a butterscotch dessert (around 9$) that had ice cream and an individually cooked cream filled butterscotch cake. It was pure deliciousness.The service here was great. Food came in a timely manner, and my group never waited for water refills or plates to be cleared. I would return to eat at Holder's tomorrow. It is great particularly for those looking for a straightforward French bistro meal."

We had hangar steaks and mussels and they were okay but I can do better myself with them any home. The broth was more salty than anything else and was missing that something that makes you want to drink it. Then broccoli rabe was bitter. Steaks were cooked correctly, frites were good, the service was very, very good. Our server was friendly, attentive, and professional. The place seems to be very popular but we did not love it."

Holders was lovely, warm and inviting. Staff was as well. Friend and I stopped for lunch, and were lucky to get there just before the lunch rush. Service was prompt, courteous and efficient without being overbearing. Menu was interesting and very varied. My friend had the Braised beef cheek, which he liked very much, and I had the seafood soup and the warm octopus and new potato salad. Octopus is a favorite of mine, but you take your chances, as it can be very rubbery if cooked poorly. Luckily, the chef at Holders knew EXACTLY how to cook it, and it was wonderful. The contrast of the octopus and the potatoes, highlighted by the sauce was delectable. Will definitely go again when in Montreal."

My wife had the biggest bowl of muscles she, or I had ever seen and she enjoyed every one. I decided on the Fish and Chips and it was likewise delicious.

We hadn't made reservations as the place we initially wanted to go to was closed for the season. When we arrived, the host seemed a bit rude about our lack of reservations (despite that the restaurant had only around a quarter to a third of its tables filled) and sat us in the very back corner. Typically this sets me off of a restaurant altogether, but the service and meal that followed this initial interaction would be hard to review at anything less than a 5 star experience. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive without being overbearing, and got our food and drinks out much quicker than anyplace similar that I've ever been to. The duck and the salmon tartare were both perfect, with the salmon tasting very fresh and the duck having a deliciously crisp skin. We shared a glass of the white port wine for dessert, which was very pleasant and different. Overall, I would very much recommend this restaurant but if you tend to get rubbed the wrong way by hosts and hostesses who are short with you then I would also recommend making reservations, no matter the day of the week."

Top notch all around..."

The restaurant is on the western edge of old Montreal on McGill just  1/2 block north of St Paul Oest street. It is inside a large stone-faced building in suite 100. It is like a downtown restaurant in many cities, filled with some businessmen in suits, but on this evening there was a lot of tables full of 30 somethings enjoying group dinners. Our server was a smiling and efficient woman who made our meal well paced with wine (decent selection but not stuffy in range), appetizers (about $10), mains (averaging about $20 - $25) and desserts (roughly $8 average). For appetizer I had a chilled salmon gravelax, very good! Others had the fisherman's soup, small salads, salmon tartar, beef tartar and gazpacho. For mains we had Hangar Steaks with Frites, special Halibut in a cream sauce topped with veggies, and I had the Duck Confit on a bed of greens with country potatoes. We enjoyed a couple of bottles of Ortas 2009 Rasteau Rhone. Desserts included a lemon mascarponi, creme brûlée, and a chocolate cremieux with coffee ice cream and sauce. Everyone enjoyed their dinner at our table, and it seems everyone else in the restaurant were smiling and enjoying good food, wine and friends."

I found a very beautiful and spacious restaurant with friendly service, and a very upscale trendy atmosphere that is perfect for a romantic dinner or work event. The bar area also is large to accompany large groups.The menu is traditional French with many variations. My colleague loved the salmon, and I chose the traditional hanger steak and frites. The fries were delicious, and the steak was A-Ok (not the best I've ever had honestly but good). The complimentary fresh French bread and butter was a wonderful way to start the meal. I chose coffee to end my meal, and it also was dark and tasty.It's hard to compete in a city of so many great French restaurants, but this is certainly one that stands on its own two feet as a nice place to experience the city's cuisine if you're in the area."

I was thirty minutes late to my reservation because my plane got delayed. They were so kind and accommodating--even stored my suitcase for me while I dined. I was seated right away at a cute window table. Once my water glass was filled the first time, they never let it get empty and brought out breads and butter for me. I started with the warm goat cheese tart. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The pastry was crisp and the goat cheese was creamy and lush and thy were paired with a basil emulsion, olive tapenade, and tomatoes which were a nice bit of acid to break up the richness. Then I had the duck confit which was sinfully delicious. The skin was crisped to absolute, melt in your mouth perfection. Not a single bite was over salted or under seasoned. It was served with a few roasted potatoes and a bed of greens (arugula I think) lightly dressed in something slightly acidic which again balanced the richness perfectly. To top off the meal, I had the butterscotch mi cuit. It was served with butterscotch ice cream and an almond twill. The mi-cuit was perfect with the bit of salt on top to balance the sweetness. The ice cream was delicious, though It may have benefitted from a hint of salt as well. There was a deep  caramel sauce on the plate as well that helped balance the sweetness of the ice cream.

The Onion soup was soupy and the cheese all melted in my mouth. For entree, I had ordered their infamous beef cheek and that was delicious as well. At first, I wanted to get the rib eye because I haven't really had beef cheek in a long time and I forgot how tasteful it was. The server told me not to and I really should keep my order and I am glad I did. The beef cheek was cooked just right and as soon as you take a bite, it literally melts in your mouth.

It could be a case of high expectation but I was surprised at how boring the food was.Im a huge eggs benedict fan so I went for the eggs bene with gravlax. I think they chose the laziest way to make it - english muffin + gravlax + egg + hollandaise . I know sometimes the simple things are perfect but this wasnt the case. There was zero creative flair or interesting ingredients - that aside it was very boring and it felt like something I could have made at home.  The waiters were a bit clumsy - dropping water on the tables as they were refilling and on the phone at some point. The coffee we ordered was also meh , also spilled all underneath its serving plate. I dont want to judge for dinner - maybe that's where they show their prowess or maybe the eggs bene with gravlax has them uninspired but I wouldn't recommend it and hope they make an effort to change it."

The place is a large, boisterous French restaurant, which is cool. The atmosphere is upscale casual, which is great for most occasions. The food however is where we are lacking. We started with the salmon tartare, which actually was quite tasty. It has fresh, light and well seasoned. For the main, I had the duck confit which was dry and tasteless. The skin was quite juicy. However, when you got to the meat, it was very dry and bland. The braised beef cheeks looked quite good. The portion size was large and the meat very tender. However, the flavour was still lacking. Once you got over how tender it was, you realized that it really didn't have much flavour. The tilapia was one dimensional in flavour. The lobster ravioli was actually quite tasty, but beware, the portion size is quite small. For dessert we had the Chocolate Mousse with mocha ice cream. This is actually VERY good, but VERY dense. The coffee ice cream balances if quite well. The service is good, but kind of rushed. We felt like they were trying to hurry us out, even though we weren't there long.  Overall the ambiance is nice, food is meh and prices are steep. I'd think twice before returning."

We weren't hungry, but thought we should have something. We ordered the beef tartare and fried calamari. The tartare was typical, but there was some gaminess to it that came back to haunt me in the middle of the night. It was served with crostini, but I liked it better with baguette  which you need to request. I also spread a little butter on each bite to give it more richness and stave off the gaminess. My friends liked the calamari which was lightly-battered and perfectly cooked. Portion was small for the price. These are rings from large squids not the tiny ones, so no legs if you're into that like me . Desserts were priced reasonably and tasted amazing. One friend had the vanilla Creme Brûlée, I convinced another to have the Profiteroles (small puffs filled with vanilla ice cream in a pool of chocolate sauce), and I had the Butterscotch Mi-Cuit which was a butterscotch soufflé served with butterscotch ice cream and caramel with an almond cookie. We would return just for the desserts."

On one hand, it's got nice decor, the food is reasonably good, and the service is fine. On the other hand, it feels a bit artificial, and for the prices, I'd expect a better experience.On the food, it is supposed to be a french bistro and the food sort of reflects that. I had a salmon tartare, which was very good. But, the menu was littered with other options like fish and chips and pasta primavera. To me, that's a dead giveaway of a place that is going for a theme but wants to stay mainstreamed and broad. I think the other dishes people had, including the lamb and the fish and chips (I recognize the irony) were all fine. The desserts were obnoxiously large and were generally odd, gaudy takes on French dessert.The service was fine. Nothing bad, nothing especially good. It was fine; I have almost no reaction at all.The interior is both nice and revealing of the restaurant's underbelly. It has all the trappings of a classic French bistro, done in a modern, large space. But, the consequence is a feeling of almost corporate design. It's consistent with the menu, I think."

What really pushed brunch over the top were the chef's daily housemade jams: Raspberry lime and white chocolate mango on our visit, which were the perfect palate cleansers for my main dish."

The menu at first glance was not particularly appealing... But my husband had the two soft-boiled eggs, truffle tapenade, sauteed oyster mushrooms, roasted fingerling potatoes with garlic and herbs and I had the yogurt with homemade muesli. We ordered orange juice, that came with a hair in it. My cappuccino was also tasteless as was my husband's lattee (we had gone to Le Cartet the weekend before, and had delicious coffee, so were expecting the same level at Holder). My husband's dish was delicious, and mine was just ok. The portions are actually quite small... The waiter also sat a huge group with children next to us, and considering that the restaurant was empty, we did not appreciate the lack of intimacy and respect for our personal space.

/user_details?userid=xkI8q7howyrJrP4Kq8tncg,Sarah S.,"Summit, NJ",5 star rating,"I am from the NYC area, so I am used to pretentious, overpriced restaurants where the consistently amazing food is served up by rushed, disgruntled, and generally unfriendly waitstaff. I expected something like this at Holder, simply because it is a fancy restaurant in a cosmopolitan city. Coming in with that experience, I was absolutely blown away at Holder. I came with a bachelorette party of 12 and was shocked when the waitstaff told us we could easily split up our bills 12 ways. No problem. Such a request could easily get your food served with a healthy dosage of spit in a NYC restaurant. The waitstaff was so friendly. The bus boy came over to fill up our water glasses every 2 or 3 minutes. Our two waiters happily chatted with us, giving us bar recommendations for the rest of the night. Even on a fairly busy Saturday night, we never felt that they were rushed, and more importantly we did not feel rushed. As for the food, it was not only fantastic, but very reasonably priced. I had the French Onion soup and Buffalo Mozzerella Salad. I wasn't that hungry, and I figured I would be getting an average salad - what can you really do to add to a Buffalo Mozzerella salad? Well, it was easily the best I've ever had. It was served with fantastic balsamic drizzle, really high quality olive oil, arugula, pine nuts and figs. Delicious. The French Onion Soup was crusted with a hearty serving of browned gruyere, just as it should be. Overall I would highly recommend this place. The prices are fair, the staff is friendly, and the food is great."

It is very humourous that they would turn us away when the place was empty when we walked in (see picture). But clearly a popular place and by the time we left every table in the place was full. Without a reservation in busy Christmas lunch season I would recommend a reservation for anything more than 2 people. We sat at the bar.Expensive lunch:$10 soupLunch special $19 soup and pastaFood was ok.... one of my colleagues had to send the lunch special back and the meat was raw. To their their credit they did check shortly after the first bite and were quick to bring a new plate out.I have great respect for restaurants that have staff that can recognize a problem quickly. I think this was reflected in the tip.

We ordered a nice bottle of wine, a steak tartare appetizer, and salmon dish and a mahi mahi special for mains. The food was fresh. However, it was busy, so sometimes empty plates waited on our tables and wine glasses sat empty while our waiter was MIA... Not a deal breaker though. However - partway through our meal a waiter that was refilling water glasses tipped a full glass over and it landed in my lap. Staff were quick to respond and give us a new table cloth/chair etc... The waiter who spilled it, of course, sincerely apologized for the accident and directed me to the washroom where they had hand dryers so I could try and dry myself off. I was not impressed that they did not offer to comp us anything for this. Even a drink, dessert or the appetizer we had already enjoyed being deducted from our bill would have been an appreciative gesture. I instead had to spend the rest of the evening with wet jeans and we were left not feeling overly impressed.We enjoyed the food, but we would probably try another restaurant before returning to Holder again."
/user_details?userid=9BESSdhT0r6J69kJv1Rn8g,Qiwen C.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,A lot of good reviews about this restaurant and after trying twice I decided not going back.  The food is really just average. Service is definitely sub par.  The waiter usually disappears.  Calamari was ok.  Salmon tartare was average. A little under season. The yogurt sauce was not enough to make a difference. The braised beef cheek was mediocre. A bit under seasoned. Also. Short ribs could be probably better for the same cook method.  Why use beef cheeks ? potato purée was rather bland. The duck foie gras salad with poached egg was well designed with good flavor. But the greens are too little in proportion.  The chocolate cremiaux was probably the best dish among all. But there was almond bits in the ice cream that wasn't mentioned in the menu. And later they nervously denied there was any nuts. Overall I think this restuarnt is over rated.

For the brunch: It was a mini class reunion. The staff was very patient with us because some people were very late or never showed up. As for the food, I have to say the hot chocolate was delicious. Definitely not powder-made. The bacon was very thick and crispy. The eggs didn't get cold quickly. We got plenty of refill for coffee or tea. Great meal and at a very decent price! For the dinner: We were 6 people but we had a reservation. Again, the staff was quite patient with us, because one person was lactose intolerant and it can take a while to get through the menu/asking the chef for no-dairy meals. I had the lobster ravioli with truffle and butter oil. Delicious but very small portion (to be expected). I was still hungry after but I stole some delicious fries from someone else. For dessert: profiteroles and ice cream. Also delicious. I can't comment on the price, because I didn't pay. Drinks with girlfriends: On Valentine's day, 2 girlfriends and I decided to go to Holder for drinks and appetizers. We had called before to book a reservation and they told us it was not possible. When we got there, they asked us if we had a reservation. Anyway, we made it work and got a table in the bar where we could see all the couples having dinner. Great selection of drinks at prices that are expensive. Service was efficient. The selection of appetizers was not amazing. My bill was also quite high: for two drinks and a split entrée, it was over $20. Overall, I would go back to Holder for brunch and dinner, but maybe someplace else for drinks (mostly because of the price). But their wine selection is really good."

Then, we waited for that face that most snobby hosts/hostesses make (you know the face...) when they tell you that there is nothing they can do. To the contrary - the host smiled and asked us to step to the side - assuring us that he would find us a table. Within 3 minutes, we were seated. Our waiter (I believe his name is Martin?) was so kind and provided top notch service. Everything we ate was perfect - it melted on our mouths! I had the salmon tartare, lobster ravioli and the chocolate mousse. My boyfriend had the foie gras (cold), hanger steak and the Creme brûlée.

In fact, my past two trips I have been for Sunday brunch and went back at night for dinner...it is that good!I just went this past weekend and everything is as great as I remember and each time I bring a new friend they love it just as much as me. The manager, Giusseppe is amazing. In fact, he actually remember me from my trip last year! That says quite a lot about the level of service and detail the staff put in here.For this past trip, I tried the quiche for brunch which Giusseppe told me was a new addition to the menu. It was delicious. When I returned for dinner that night the place was packed. The staff were efficiently working their tables and service did not suffer which was quite impressive seeing how busy it was. The entire staff works as a team with the manager greeting guests and checking in on tables. I usually go with the duck confit which is incredible. Best duck confit I have ever had and it was actually my first duck dish a few years back when I first visited Holder. I wanted to try something new, so I went with the veal flank steak in a marsala sauce with frites. The veal was delicious. I 've never had veal so tender. This place is a must try in Montreal. I have yet to have a dining experience in Montreal that has matched Holder. I can't wait to go back and visit again. Thank you Giusseppe for always a great experience!"

The atmosphere of Holder is incredibly classy but since it's located in the heart of downtown Montreal I expect nothing less. The first time I came in here it was spectacular, dragged in here by my friend's mother urging us to try the fried ravioli, a mixture of cheese blended with a bit of jalapeños. I am a huge jalapeno poppers fan so I couldn't stop reaching for more, despite the heaviness of the starter. After, I decided to drag my friend back there so that we could get a better sense of the restaurant. We ordered my usual drink, a Jameson and ginger ale, then proceeded with the meal. At one point the waiter disappeared but for 9:00 pm at night it was relatively packed. I was craving seafood so I ordered a pan-seared tilapia in my pidgin French which came out relatively nicely. I'm not a big fan of tilapia as I often think it's a very cheap fish but this one was dressed nicely for the occasion. It was served on a bed of julienned carrots and other greens topped with almonds (I think, again forgive me my memory is hazy). Not bad, but not knock you off your feet amazing. Overall, not a terrible dining experience, our waiter was a bit lack luster but hey he didn't ruin the meal. However this place is incredibly pricey and for the price I paid I expected much better quality food. But hey, you're on vacation splurge a little. It was a decent choice for the price but with no regrets now I leave the decision making up to you."

It was a large restaurant and tables were close but never had any hearing problems but at the time it was only half full. My wife ordered the mussels and thought they were fantastic. I had the beef bourgagoin and also thought it was great. mine came with mashed potatoes which were great with the sauce. Hers came with fries that we both thought were great. We thought this was the best food we had in our short Montreal and Quebec city jaunt. The two entrees plus tax and tip was $49 USD.

My choices from the menu were simple and rustic which fit my desire for comfort food due to the cold weather.   I started with a Grey Goose dirty martini, and my normal 3 olives...the olives were not the usual gigantor ones served locally here in NOVA, these were quite petite and as I bit into my first one off the skewer I realized it was not pitted!  I don't mind, but it helps to know ahead...and let's face it spitting those out in your hand isn't too graceful in public.  But the bartender did my drink justice...dry and oh so dirty, and the glass was full...yummm.My starter was a vegetable soup with a great beefy tomato broth as the base, nice touch of sage in the background, salted and peppered to perfection.  The veggies were rough chopped including scallions, zucchini, chunks of tomato, petite lima beans and julienne mushrooms. The steaming bowl was topped with fresh shaved parmesean.Main course consisted of beef cheeks (no, not the ones you sit on silly) bourguignon style.  This is classic French cooking...this method slowly simmers the beef in wine which tenderizes cuts of meat that would have been too tough to cook any other way.  The flavor of carrots, garlic and onions came shining through in the wonderful sauce that draped over the mashed potatoes like a velvet sheath.  Simply paired with the beef and mashers were haricovert....green beans folks!  I tried to figure out if the chef had actually used a burgundy, as the rich sauce could have been done with a good cabernet instead.All in all the meal was everything I wanted that evening and since I'm headed to Montreal on a regular basis I will probably go again.  The nice thing here is that the staff instantly recognizes us Americans and quickly opts out your French menu for one in English....Merci!"

We ordered cream of asparagus soup with crab and ham (great depth of flavor), beef cheek bourguinon (amazingly flavorful and tender), duck confit on a bed of arugula with potatoes, and fish soup (the only disappointment, since it was too fishy---think anchovy taste instead of a delicate fish soup). The waiter recommended a butterscotch tart/ice cream dessert---delicious combo of hot and cold!We will definitely return on our next trip back Montreal."

Came with 3 coworkers on a Weds. night around 7 and was glad to have a reservation - the place was pretty crowded.We all started off with some Canadian beer and decided to skip appetizers. 3 of us ordered the T-bone & pommefrites, another ordered tilapia. No sooner had I sipped my beer, my entree was set down in front of me. A little too quick, I felt like there was no time to relax.T-bone was so-so....cut very thin. Since I asked for mine rare, it was barely cooked (obviously) and not hot, the butter they put on top wouldn't really melt.Pommefrites were also nothing special...flavor was there but they were more soggy than crispy.Overall, fun/nice atmosphere with mediocre food; I think you can do better."

The hostess was kind enough and told us to use the banquette we were sitting on to change our daughter's poopie diaper.  She was obviously being accomodating, and stated that she let people do that all the time.  I'm not sure how many customers would like to smell poop during dinner, but we had to do it anyway.  So I apologize to all of those who were there the night we ate there.Another interesting note is that they seated those of us with kids in the back area.  Every single table in our section had a child with them. It seemed odd but somewhat understandable.  That way, the kidless could ""enjoy' their meal without being interrupted, I suppose.I ordered the braised short rib. It was ok. I probably ordered the ""wrong"" thing because I could have done it better myself at home. However the steak tartare was quite tasty and a good portion size!  My daughter had the salmon which was perfectly cooked and the haricot verts were al dente!Probably won't be back but it was a good meal, but not outstanding.Thank you to the kind hostess who let us change her in the open... but this may not make your patrons happy."

For the main course, we ordered the halibut (not on the menu, but was on the chalkboard) as well as the pappardelle with mushrooms.

The beef cheek was well balanced with sauteed pearl onions and exotic mushrooms. Try the local beer in the red varietal which had a nice spice for the winter months.

Not very expensive for the quality of food they're serving and totally delicious. Their boeuf bourginon is not actually a bourgignon, but rather a slow cooked beef cheek served with potatoes. That being said, it's still delicious. The service is great although the ambiance is a bit noisy.  Try the hanger steak with the chocolate cream for dessert! mmmm! :) Oh and one more thing, this place needs to get faster at giving th bill and taking payment from customers.

I had never had Shepard's Pie so I have nothing to compare it to but from other people who had eaten it they said it was very unique but the best they had ever eaten. The service was very good and all the food came out at the perfect time. Also, I have multiple food allergies and the waiter was very aware and was very clear on what I could and could not eat. In terms of dessert it was quite hard eating dessert at most places since I am allergic to nuts. We ended up not eating dessert here because there we're only 2 desserts I could eat but they all sounded so good. Overall this place was so good and I would definitely go back!!!!"

/user_details?userid=js6fDDsdm2RcvhpboZOfYA,Laura O.,"Halifax, Canada",4 star rating,"Restaurant Holder in Montreal (via halifood.com)During my recent birthday weekend, spent in beautiful Montreal, I managed to have a somewhat impromptu celebratory dinner at one of the city's trendier bistros: Holder. Being one of the restaurants that I had stumbled upon during my pre-trip online research, I was excited to physically stumble upon it as well, while taking a snowy stroll through Old Montreal on the Saturday night of our long weekend. The frigid temperature and proximity of Holder to our accommodations, the W Montreal, might have also played a part in our quick decision to jump in and try Holder - that, and the fact that a customer just leaving the restaurant, who eyed us eyeing the menu, excitedly approached us to vouch for the bistro as a must-try. We were sold.We entered Holder with cautious anticipation, it was eerily quiet on the streets of the city and it wasn't exactly tourist season, even in Montreal - we weren't sure what kind of atmosphere awaited us behind those doors. Once through the entrance, the loud bustle and conversations of an absolutely packed restaurant erupted in our ears. We walked into a full-on, middle-of-a-Saturday-night rush, in downtown Montreal - and there wasn't a seat in the house. Actually, there was ONE left... a high-top for two on the bar side that we happily accepted. The menu was very French, which was absolutely fine because I had a desire to try salmon tartar for the first time on this trip, and Holder was one of several bistros I noticed had it on their menu in downtown Montreal. My mind was made up on that pretty quickly. To begin the meal, I chose the salad of new potatoes and marinated octopus. (Pardon the photos - all done on my trusty iPhone).My dinner date started with Holder's take on insalata capresa, throwing in arugula and figs for good measure - a very nice addition. My potato and octopus salad featured a surprisingly nice grainy mustard vinaigrette with lots of tang; enough to balance the rich texture and flavour of the octopus, as well as the starchy potatoes.The salmon tartar was done with yogurt and Mujjol caviar, and served with a lovely baguette crisp and micro greens. The flavour was decadent and rich, the perfect match for the crisp bread.  I love the texture of raw fish and the essence of salmon, so I also had no troubles eating it straight from my fork with no accompaniment. My date opted for a very French beef cheek bourguignon with mashed potato and mini green beans. Our server had assured him the beef cheeks were actually a Holder specialty, a dish that had been helping them to earn their reputation. I don't think a bite was left on the plate when he was done.As you know, I'm not easily sold on dessert. To be completely truthful, I couldn't even finish my tartar, however, it was my birthday dinner and so I was talked into splitting something sweet. We ordered the chocolate mousse with coffee ice cream, and were presented with a very cute dish - the perfect size in my opinion. The mousse actually wasn't a mousse at all, and after asking our server about this he explained that there isn't quite a direct translation from english to french for the word mousse. This was more of a ganache, the texture being much more dense than a real mousse, and the flavour very decadent. The house made coffee ice cream was very nice, and the tiny chocolate-covered coffee bean on top an adorable touch. I suppose I was happy after all that we finished off the meal with a little something sweet.Back out into the frigid streets of Old Montreal, softened by wine consumption, full bellies and the sight of that beautiful drifting white snow against the frozen cobblestone sidewalks.(photos on halifood.com)"

Our server was very welcoming & accommodating to our needs--my friend has a gluten allergy. The beef cheeks a la bourguignon were excellent and prepared as though I were in a hole-in-the-wall in France. Everything was seasoned in a manner that lent to flavor, without overpowering the foods. Holder's finest quality remains that their food stands alone- no theatrics were implied, just purely & sublimely prepared dishes.  I started with the tartare which was also fresh & clean. The only issue my guests and I came across were the drinks. We ordered several drinks, mostly wine. However, all the cocktails that were ordered seemed to be poorly made. The cosmo had the color and overpowering flavor of cranberry & the sidecar was too bitter-- too much citrus, perhaps. I will order beer and wine the next time I come! I typically order creme brulee when it is available. If you eat here, you must order theirs! The custard was loaded with actual vanilla bean speckles. However, it is hard to choose because all their other desserts blew our entire table away. I will visit again on my next trip to the area."

The place is classy (lots of warm tones - brown, copper) without being too pretentious. It's not too cramped, but we were there on a Monday night so the crowd was sparse anyhow.The food: I enjoyed the food for the most part, some dishes definitely were better than others and there were a few disappointments along the way. The warm potato salad with marinated octopus was out of this world. It was bursting with flavor and was more octopus than potato salad in the end. The goat cheese starter was also very nice, though quite rich. For entrees, we had the lobster ravioli and the fish & chips. The ravioli was fine, but nothing special. I didn't care for the presentation or the mass of onions in the dish. The fish was nicely done and melted in your mouth. Dessert was a brownie with chocolate ice cream and some sort of raspberry sauce. This was the worst part of the meal and it really lacked a deep chocolate flavor. The service: This is where the whole experiences goes a bit awry. We're seated promptly by a stiff maitre d' and then wait for 20 minutes for anyone to come take a drink order or tell us about the specials. Finally the maitre d' comes over and says something off-putting like, ""Looks like you're anxious to order"" and takes our orders without telling us the specials. The food comes promptly and was true to the menu. We receive no other service until halfway through our entrees I finally flag down a waiter to order another drink. Apparently, he was our waiter but this was the first time he spoke to us, as he was busy flirting with other patrons. One of the drinks was delayed until our entrees were nearly completed. For dessert, he reeled off a long list instead of giving us a menu. Only during dessert were we ever asked how the food was. The waiter was jovial but he was not good at his job service wise.  This is hard to rate because the food was overall very good but the rest of the experience I would never want to re-live.  Average."

The server was very nice and honest with his suggestions. The main courses were about $20 each. The taste, presentation and first class service were top notch for such a great price."

/user_details?userid=5QHQWEgO9Sx8uTUMQ3pFNw,David C.,"Short Hills, NJ",4 star rating,"We ate at Holder on New Year's Eve, and really liked it.  There are a few tables near the bar, where they seated us for a drink while we waited for our ""real"" table, but the spot was so good, with a great ""people-watching"" view of the entire room, so we stayed there and had our meal too.  My GF speaks French, but I don't, and the waiter was really accommodating to both of us, despite the fact that he was so busy and the place was packed.  Very stylish crowd and good looking waitstaff... I think both me and my GF had to try to avoid starring at a few of them, ESP after a few glasses of wine.  Ok, now that its established that Holder is a scene, what else did I like?  Well, the food was great, but one goat cheese appetizer was just ok and that's where they lose a star.  Holder is not cheap, but it's way more affordable than some of the more formal French bistros.  Holder is a brasserie, which is basically one big room with a bar, so it's not tiny and intimate like a bistro, but we expected that and liked it.  Definitely a good choice for a nice meal in Montreal."

I had an issue with the fish being a bit rubbery, but the rest of the stuff was ok. I would go back again, but it would have to be when its quieter cause we could hardly hear each other over all the people talking so loudly"
/user_details?userid=-njC3scq41FLpi89cuy5yQ,Mike H.,"Ramona, CA",3 star rating,"Pretty good place.  I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.  Busy atmosphere.   I had the salmon tartare with french fries and was pleased with the meal, but not blown away.  Not overly expensive, but I would not consider this place to be a good deal."

/user_details?userid=QG6bfDsKMS7xBo-eDnX-Ew,Ernie C.,"Fort Mill, SC",4 star rating,"In town only for two nights, wearing shorts and tshirts like typical American tourists but were treated just fine by the nice staff at Holders.  Visited about 7pm on a Sunday night.  Full English staff and menu.  Wife got the lobster ravioli ($21).  Portion was on the small side, but tasty.  I got the mussels and frites.  Outstanding!  Some might complain that the frites were a little on the soggy side however, I prefer them that way.  Also got the mozzarela, tomato, arugula and fig salad to split ($11).  Extensive wine and bar, but didn't order adult beverages.  I observed most other patrons either ordered the mussels as well, or got the steak and frites.   This seems to be in the business/banking district and I assume popular at lunch.  I found it far enough from the Old Montreal tourist area to weed out the other Ugly Americans like ourselves  ha ha!  For a quasi-upscale French/Canadian restaurant, this was great without breaking the bank."
/user_details?userid=0s1QKLAVFhEs3Ssoqhr9Mg,Leslie F.,"Halifax, Canada",5 star rating,"I spent the past weekend in Montreal on a girls' getaway weekend, hoping for only 2 things: good food and good times. Thanks in part to Holder Restaurant Bar, those wishes were granted. We stumbled upon this gem on our search for a Saturday brunch spot that could accommodate our group of 7. The menu was a nice size - a decent selection without being overwhelmed by choices, and the wait-staff was attentive. (I should also note that we had a gluten-free diner in our midst and they were very helpful in meeting her dietary needs and restrictions.) I had one of the omelets, served with choice of croissant, baguette or fresh bread and homemade preserves, a ramekin of fresh fruit and a portion of potato au gratin. The omelet was huge - fluffy and delicious, the fruit was fresh, the homemade preserves were a delight, and the potato au gratin was to die for - potatoey/cheesey/salty goodness... a fabulous way to start any day. All that plus coffee and tip came to under $20. The entire group (that's 7/7) was SO impressed with the quality and value of the food, and we all hope to be back sometime soon."
