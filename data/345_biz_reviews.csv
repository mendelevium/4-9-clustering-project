Two of us stopped at this location after being a little disappointed with our experience at Fairmount Bagel (TLDR: St. Viateur is much better, go here instead!!). We ended stopping here twice for breakfast. There's a cafe inside with various coffee options as well. However, we opted to get our meals to-go (COVID-19). The employees were friendly and patient. During our two stops, we got:1) Everything/All-dressed with garlic & herb cream cheese2) Everything/All-dressed Breakfast sandwich3) Rosemary sea salt with garlic & herb cream cheese4) Rosemary sea salt Breakfast SandwichBagels:Both bagel flavours were great. The rosemary bagel definitely had a distinct taste of rosemary, but not so much that it was overwhelming. The all dressed bagel was very dressed, and was probably one of the best everything bagel I've had so far. We ended up liking these bagels so much that we bought a half a dozen of each flavour to take back to Toronto. Toppings/Fillings:Overall, the breakfast sandwich itself is a bit messy to eat due to the amount of egg and vegetables, but was so good! It was super filling, and would recommend if you're a bit hungrier/looking for a bit of a healthier option.With that said though, the cream cheese + bagel combo can't be beaten - there's a very generous portion of cream cheese, and with a freshly toasted bagel, incredibly difficult to beat.The bakery itself was really cool too - we were able to see the bagels being freshly made in the back, which was a super nice touch. Would definitely recommend if you're nearby in Montreal!"

ST-Viateur Café comes to our sight; hmmm delicious bagels are calling is. I took the traditional all dressed bagel sandwich (smoked salmon, cream cheese and other ingredients) and my sister had sesame bagel Ham and cheese sandwich, which is called Le Plateau. It was only takeout, but outside there were benches to sit so we can enjoy our sandwiches. Inside, the looks is ok, kind of messy and worn out. The service was good and quick. The bagel sandwiches were good. Perfect spot to pick a bagel sandwich while you are walking."

It's the perfect place to have a bagel brunch or sandwich to go. I find their drink selection a bit lacking but for food it's more than decent and service is fast and efficient every time I've visited.However, if you want just the bagels, I recommend going on St-Viateur and going to the original location."

The morning of my departure, I made a run to purchase a dozen. They have approximately 6 different types made fresh on site. I ordered half a dozen of the rosemary and sea salt and another half of the sesame. Because they're always made fresh on site and warm still, they were bagged in paper bags, but they give you the plastic bag to package it afterwards. Who wouldn't love fresh bagels?! They're wonderful to eat fresh, but they're also perfect to keep for later simply by putting them in the freezer for us out of town folks."

I now understand the hype. I purchased the all-dressed bagel, similar to the state's ""everything"" bagel. For the sandwich, it came with egg, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and mayo. So dang-on good! The bagel had a wonderful crunch to it, however, it still had a softness to it. The staff were beyond friendly and helpful! To note: this place can get pretty busy on the weekends, especially if you plan on dining in. This place will be my regular bagel spot for my future ventures to MTL."

We ordered the lox bagel with sesame 10/10 and the sausage and egg on an everything bagel. Also love how it comes with fruits! Yummmm. This spot Kickstarted my slight here and I wish I bought a dozen + to bring back. I already have cravings!!! Until next time"
/user_details?userid=jmhejyRUMeqGIgkETsaJ_w,Yoland E.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We had the Traditional and WOW! sandwiches, personally I preferred the former as its ingredients complimented each other more. I feel like the eggplant in the WOW! overpowered the taste of the sandwich. The patio seating outside was okay, it was a bit small (I know it's due to the current situation though, so I won't fault them for it). Just one thing to note as well is they only take cash or debit."
/user_details?userid=PUrh006bUn0VbodfJSeDzg,Joy H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Wonderful bagel spot!St. Viateur makes really lovely bagels that are nice and springy! I will say they do feel slightly overpriced, especially when your nearest grocery store may have similar-but-mass-produced ones for $2 per dozen. But if you're serious about your bagels, or have a brunch coming up, then it's a nice treat to have. My favourite is their sesame because they really load it up with sesame seeds! The sesame is super fragrant! Try it out!"

The way bagels are made here are the way bagels SHOULD be made. My complaint on American bagels are that they are always too thick, but Montréal bagels are slightly sweetened and thinner. They were so good, we actually ordered a bag of bagels and stuck them in the freezer. 2 months later, and they were STILL as delicious as when we ordered them! If you order extra, do NOT leave the bagels out overnight as they harden. We got the Rosemary and Sea Salt Bagel, the Sesame Bagel, and the Original Bagel. We also ordered the Smoked Salmon which comes with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and a bagel. If you order to go, they make it into a sandwich for you."

The bagels here are made fresh and very yummy! In Montreal I had a smoked salmon fix! I ordered the Traditional w/ smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onions, capers and lemon. It was yummy!  The bagel was nice and chewy and everything tasted great together. My cousin ordered Moo Moo w/ roast beef, Swiss cheese, lettuce, dijon mustard. My other cousin ordered a plain bagel w/ cream cheese Oh, I also ordered some bagels to take home and share with some co-workers."

/user_details?userid=ia5kvJxYR8gPItl9O4W0Mg,Tzarina W.,"Chandler, AZ",3 star rating,Cash only. Line can be found here but it will go quickly. No seating. Just small area to stand. You'll need to cut your own bagel. There's a variation of different kinds of cream cheese tubs to buy. You can see the bagels being made from scratch. 9grain bagel and cinnamon raisin bagels with cream cheese was $3.50CAD. Bagels were received cold and on the hard side. Didn't finish bagels.

It's much more spacious, have plenty of seating space if you wish to grab a quick bite and they make bagels on site, so you're not missing out on anything should you choose to go to the cafe instead. I would definitely go back to the cafe whether it's to buy bagels in bulk or enjoy one there."

Not saying one is better than the other, but this is just as tasty and it is unique. The bagels are slightly smaller and crunchy on the outside but nice and doughy in the middle. Their cream cheese was AMAZING, light and fluffy almost like a whipped cream cheese. Great coffee too and all at a low price. This was a breakfast recommended from all the Montreal locals and it delivered!!"

I am into New York bagel and Montreal does make good bagel. Bagels are made fresh right in front of you. The staff are friendly.If you are from the US they don't take US cards, you have to pay Canadian dollar. I feel this could be changed since this is a tourist destination and they could accept foreign credit cards."
/user_details?userid=DgLYl_RrquiEQBe3maBNvA,Angela W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I liked this place so much that I went back to it twice during my recent Montreal trip! Let's just say... the bagels here finitely lived up to its hype. Prices are reasonable too for the portion size!I went for brunch for both times that I was there. First time I got the Traditional which is a smoked salmon bagel sandwich with cream cheese. The bagel I chose was the all dressed option. The sandwich was okay and there was nothing too special about it. But the bagel itself was amazing! Hence why I want to give this place a 5-star rating. My boyfriend got the Moomoo sandwich with rosemary sea salt bagel (another one of their highly recommended specialty bagels). He thought that one was okay.The second time I went, it was before we left Montreal. We not only went there to eat brunch but to also grab the bagels to take home (YES they were that good!) This time my boyfriend got the smoked salmon bagel with all dressed while I was feeling for a Breakfast Sandwich Deluxe. I got the rosemary bagel this time and felt like it didn't wow me like the all dressed type. Again, the sandwich itself tasted average to me but my boyfriend really loved the smoked salmon. This time both of us went with the salad as side and the portions were hugeeeeeee! Definitely worth the price. We ended up getting two dozen bagels to take home with one dozen being the all dressed option and the other dozen being rosemary. They ran out of the rosemary so they replaced 6 with flax seed. The bagels smelled soooooo good fresh out of the oven and I was fighting strong temptations to sneak a bite during the car ride home. TIP: ask for some bags instead of just the paper bag to wrap your take out bagels! It will make life so much easier without worrying about them falling out! Overall I really enjoyed the experience. If you are feeling hungry, go for the sandwich options. But I think if you just want to try the bagels, you should go with just the bagels with a spread."

First on Monkland, then at their bagel shop, and now at the Cafe on Mont Royal, I've tasted all their bagels and still can't pick a favourite. They have bagels for every taste - sesame, all dressed, whole wheat, cinnamon & raisin, and rosemary (a must try!). They're all fresh and soft in the inside, and their crispy texture on the outside will make you crave a bite every now and then. I love their location on Mont Royal. It's cozy and authentic, and staff is always friendly and welcoming. I always bring my friends visiting Montreal since you can have fresh bagels out of the oven and an incredible brunch at a good price. Make sure to come early as there's always a lot of people waiting in line for a table - but you can also skip the line if you want to grab smth to go! I strongly recommend the traditional smoke salmon with the artichoke salad - it's to die for! *Tip: they only take cash and canadian debit cards"

This location also has a dine in cafe which was packed on a recent Sunday afternoon -- but the line is for tables -- go past it to the short line for take-out bagels hot out of the oven.  These alot smaller and less doughy than NY style with a hint of sweetness from the honey they use. Unless they are hot and fresh you must toast them!Sesame and Poppy are the bestsellers and my sister actually bought 3 dozen to smuggle back into The States!  They freeze well we were told.For about 75 cents (US) this is the best deal in town.  Full disclosure -- we also tried Fairmount Bagels and they were a close 2nd place to these."
/user_details?userid=tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,Joy B.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Those of you who regularly read my reviews know that I'm not a breakfast girl, but if there's one breakfast staple I HAVE embraced, it's the humble bagel. A legend in its own right in a city that's famous for its food, St-Viateur is the premiere bagel purveyor in Montreal. The flagship location is in the Mile End on Rue Saint Viateur, to which this world-famous shop owes its name. We instead ended up at the Mont-Royal store, which also operates a cafe for eating and drinking in.Compared to an American bagel*, a Montreal-style bagel is smaller and slightly sweet. The bagels are hand-shaped and boiled in honey water before being placed in a wood-fired oven, making the bagels fragrant and chewy. Depending on where they land in the oven, some bagels come out browner than others, something I noticed about my poppy seed bagel. This arrived cut in halves and quarters and with cream cheese on the side for self-slathering as desired. Because of the honey flavor and the reduced density of the inside, you could eat these without any added topping and be fine simply enjoying the chew of the bread.I did not make it to St-Viateur's biggest competitor--Fairmount Bagel--during my trip, since let's be honest, I also had to gorge myself on croissants and pastries while I was visiting the city. Taste-testing more carb-laden bagel deliciousness in the future gives me a reason, among many, to return, and so should you.[*] When I say ""American bagel"" I mean bagels made in the fine northeastern states of New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, since bagels anywhere else in the USA are crap and not worth the water they're boiled in. Bagels on the east coast have the hallmark crunchy texture on the outside while being remarkably chewy and dense on the inside with a 'pull' as you bite or pinch, served with a generous slab of cream cheese and often still warm from the baking process. Bagels everywhere else make me sad and prone to profanity-laden tirades, with which my friends and family are well familiar."

This sandwich has legit changed my life and landed in my top 10 sandwiches list. It has spicy marinated eggplant, sundried tomato, pesto, lettuce and goat cheese and is called WOW, for obvious reasons. Pro Tip: The toppings are enough for two, so get an extra plain bagel and split it! Can not recommend this spot enough for their bagels and all the variations!"
/user_details?userid=EcALn2zLCFa5CcLJU41FiA,Naomi S.,"Syracuse, NY",5 star rating,"My weakness is a good bagel and coffee. This place was worth the journey (not only from NY to Montreal but the Metro ride and hike as well). My perfect bagel is a little sweet and still soft despite being warmed. This was almost perfection. I love the Montreal style of bagel with the nice big hole, the tinge of sweetness, and the crisp crust. If only they were a touch softer they would be pure perfection. That said they had an amazing flavor and two bagels with butter and a cappuccino was the perfect start to the day. The line to get a table was long but actually moved quite rapidly. The staff was very polite and bilingual so we were able to order in English. This was a major plus as while I took French in college and tried to refresh myself before the trip I am not nearly bilingual enough to feel confident using it."

It was similar to chicken noodle but fancier :) I had my sandwich on a rosemary salt bagel, which I highly recommend. I had guac on the side to dip it. My husband ordered the cream cheese and lox. Also great.This restaurant is cash only, which we were unaware of. We had to run across the street to an ATM and definitely took a hit. So just keep that in mind for your next visit!"

We got two of their bagel sandwiches including their traditional and the a la coque deluxe which had egg, ham and tomato. This was HUGE with the salad and the bagel was PERFECT. It was chewy, dense and delicious, just like a bagel should be! The traditional had smoked salmon and cream cheese which is the ULTIMATE combo. I asked for the cream cheese on the side and they gave a HUGE portion. The tuna and artichoke salad were also good but ate a little heavily.

Nonetheless, St. Viateur definitely has some solid bagels. They're perhaps a tad sweeter and smaller than NY bagels.You can tell that this spot is popular. The people working here have probably gone through the same conversations with tourists over and over.Nonetheless, it's worth stopping in this casual cafe. We came at an off-hour (around 2pm on a weekend), so we were able to quickly order a dozen of bagels. (Though some flavors were out! Just be warned.) I was kind of surprised they sold Philadelphia cream cheese and nothing more special than that.I really liked the rosemary and thyme bagel. Check it out!"

We are bagel snobs coming from NYC and were skeptical at first but these are really great bagels. Smaller than what we are used to and less doughy texture. The price for a bagel and lox sandwich is very reasonable by NYC standards and delicious. Also tried the tuna salad and roast beef sandwiches.

Go to their website to obtain more details.  We visited the St-Viateur Bagel & Café Mont-Royal location.  There is on the street meter parking.  The process for metered parking is to park next to a parking number. (It usually is a letter and number). Then go to the Parking machine (English Language available), enter the parking number and then enter the amount of time. The machines take coins or credit cards.The cafe offers take-out or sit-down options.  They take cash only. No credit cards.  I ordered the sesame bagel with cream cheese and lox. It was delicious!

/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",3 star rating,"There's a longstanding debate about whose bagels are better: Montreal or NYC.  Both claim the local water and home-made variations like the addition of a touch of honey in Montreal make their bagels both unique and the best. Being from the West Coast, I'm a poor choice to wax poetic about bagels but I've had enough to know what I enjoy.  We stopped by St-Viateur and it's considered one of Montreal's best with several locations throughout the city.  Sure enough, with a late brunch arrival, the place was packed with a line out the door.  If you simply want to order bagels only, a short line awaits with a cashier nearby the impressive oven with lines of freshly bagels being made.  For take-out, you can bypass the line by the door but go to the same cashier that processes all dine-in customers.  For tourists, only Canadian debit is accepted so this is largely a cash only establishment.  The interior space is compact and busy with servers expertly navigating the tight spaces, coordinating seating, and bringing all the combination bagel orders.  For larger groups (ie: 4 or more), expect longer waits as there are more tables for 2 or 3 tops.  We waited about 45 minutes but the wait for a 2 person table was as short as 15 minutes. The menu consists largely of bagel choices (plain, sesame, everything, rosemary and salt, raisins, etc.) with your choice of meats (ie: Traditional lox, Italian, Montreal with smoked meats) and finally a choice of multiple salads (crab, macaroni, green) or soup (chicken macaroni elbow soup). Our order:Traditional -$12.50. Plain toasted bagel with smoked salmon, plentiful cream cheese, capers, onions and tomatoes.  Very classic.  Loved the smoked salmon and cream cheese.  The bagel was chewier and harder than I expected without much unique flavor profile likely because it was a plain bagel.  I'm a huge fan of NYC salt bagels so this was much more muted.  The chicken soup was tasty but the white chicken meat was quite dry and overcooked.  A La Coque Deluxe - $10.50. Rosemary salt bagel toasted with omelette egg, grilled ham, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.  This bagel was tastier but also quite chewier and hard from being toasted. The crab salad on the side was imitation crab and while fine wasn't noteworthy. Overall, we were happy to stop by and try St. Viateur but thought the waits were a touch long for a rather standard bagel experience.  Might have been a better choice to order half a dozen bagels to go, dress ourselves with salmon and ham and egg, and enjoy at home.  This stop is quite popular with the tourists and the staff does a great job with the crowds.  St. Viateur accepts Canadian debit or cash only."

But in my humble opinion, St. Viateur reigns supreme because of this location that's a sit down cafe. They serve great salads, soups, drinks and sandwiches all on their famous bagels. Generous portions and inviting atmosphere. The aesthetics really do matter, and St. Viateur captured what Fairmont hasn't yet. They succeeded on multiple categories: location, branding, marketing and most importantly, product. Happy customer here. Will return."

They are just different - almost like comparing apples and oranges. NYC bagels are thick, doughy and soft while Montreal bagels are sweet, thin and crunchy. While I will say that I need an NYC bagel topped with cream cheese or butter, there's just something about a Montreal bagel that makes it easier to enjoy alone. But, ordering a plain Montreal bagel for your first experience would just be downright wrong. Because of that, we made sure to hit up St-Viateur's cafe location (it seemed like the regular location just had plain bagels and no bagel sandwiches).I ordered a sesame bagel stuffed with smoked pastrami and mustard. No cheese, no other toppings. Just meat, mustard and a bagel (oh, and pickles on the side it's like they know me). This was absolute perfection. The sweet and crunchy bagel combined with the smoky and flavorful meat and spicy mustard was the weirdest yet most glorious combination of flavors. I finished my bagel in less than five minutes and had to display some serious self control to avoid ordering another.This bagel was pricey but was undoubtedly one of the most delicious things that I've eaten in years. 5++++ stars for this spot."

So good in fact that we took a bagel with cream cheese to go for a later snack. I would come back next time I'm in Montreal and I would definitely recommend this place."

If you forget once you arrive there is an ATM at the end of the block to grab cash. Overall I had a great experience at the St-Viateur Bagel and Cafe! I ordered a coffee and smoked salmon and cream cheese on a ""full dressed"" (everything) bagel and my friend ordered ham and Swiss on a plain bagel and an apple juice. At first the cafe looks really expensive because their sandwich options are all $10-12, but then if you read further the menu notes that they all come with either soup or a salad. There are multiple salad options to choose from but only one soup. If you don't want a large meal you can forgo the soup or salad and get just the sandwich for $3 less. I opted to just build my own sandwich and I was impressed! The bagel was perfectly toasted and came with a heaping portion of salmon and cream cheese and a side of cantaloupe. My friend did the pressed ham and cheese and she loved it! It came warm and was almost like a bagel panini. She also really enjoyed the apple juice! I would recommend this location over others since this has the option for patrons to sit down. Either way, a St. Viateur bagel is a MUST when traveling to  Montreal!"

It's a small space, which is why I think the lineup was so long. The coffee was excellent , and the bagels were to die for. We got the traditional and the club. The crab salad and pasta salad on the side was the perfect compliment to the meal. Portions are generous, and prices are fair. When you're done your meal you pay at the register where you can order bagels to go if you're interested. Minus one star because I don't think they make their cream cheese, as I saw Philadelphia containers in the fridge."

The bagels here have a large hole which means less bagel, which I'm not complaining about since bagels are so carb heavy. Consistency wise, the outside reminded me more of a cracker which gave it a nice crunch.

The food was good, but nothing spectacular and I would not go out of my way to go back. However, the reason for my 3 star review is mostly due to the service. We waited 25-30 mins to be seated and then were seated for almost another 20 minutes before anyone even looked at us. People who were seated after us already received their food and we had not even been given waters yet. It wasn't until I waved wildly at one of the waitresses that we were even noticed.Overall, the food is fine, but if I come back to Montreal I probably won't visit again."

We made a trip up here on our way to Mount Royal. The bagels itself were okay, nothing spectacular. The wait was a little long for a Thursday morning (about 25-30 minutes to get seated for a table of 2). You get a bagel and a side of soup of the day or a salad (if you choose neither, you'll subtract $3.00). It's a cash only establishment so ensure you bring sufficient cash prior to visiting.The service was subpar, since we didn't get water or a chance to order until after 5/10 mins after we were seated. Decent food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."

Look out for the bold sign sign on top of the entrance which clearly shows that this place is a specialty bagel shop.[SERVICE] - 2/5The servers seemed so unhappy with their jobs. I tried so hard to be nice to them but they were not friendly at all.[DÉCOR] - 4/5 I liked the open-concept kitchen to show off their signature method of creating bagels. They hand-made the dough, soaked their bagels in water, and then cooked it in the wood fire oven. The seating area was intimate and reminisced the traditional bakery from over 60 years ago. [QUALITY] - 5/5I applaud this place for their homemade bagels, high-quality ingredients, and fresh ingredients. [ORDER] - 4/5Traditional Bagel Sandwich - $12.50: I got the rosemary and sea salt bagel, which was chewy and denser than a normal bagel. Smoked salmon was soft and fresh. Cream cheese was rich and savoury. Tomato, onion, capers, and lemon added crunch to the otherwise soft bagel. All sandwiches were accompanied with one choice of salad or soup, I chose the tuna salad and it was quite refreshing and did not have an overwhelming amount of mayonnaise. [OVERALL] - 4/5 The ingredients inside the sandwich overpowered the rosemary and sea salt flavours of the bagel, but I really enjoyed the bagel as a whole. Next time, I think I will order an all dressed bagel to create a better contrast contrast with the cream cheese and salmon. Overall, I would definitely recommend the high-quality and 100% natural Traditional Bagel Sandwich!"

The first time I ordered the WOW! and the second time I went with the Veggie Deluxe. I'll say that if I ordered the Veggie Deluxe the first time I wouldn't have been back. It was fine, but the amount of veggies really overpowered the bagel and I would have probably preferred just to have a salad and the bagel on the side. The WOW! though, they make this amazing marinated eggplant that is unlike anything I've ever had, put on a delicious disc of goat cheese and spice it up with tomatoes and pesto. The bagels are legit so be careful if you order one of the sandwiches to order wisely, otherwise I'd say keep it simple, pick a schmear and be on your way."

The location is beautiful with large windows looking out to the Mont-Royal street. The kitchen is open and you can see the staff busily making the bagels fresh on the spot. The lunch options are a variety of bagel sandwiches that come with either soup or salad (broad definition; includes green salad, pasta, crab, artichoke, etc.). You can choose the kind of bagel you want for your sandwich, and can also have it regular or hot-pressed. We tried the:1. Traditional on all-dressed bagel - smoked salmon, cream cheese, and capers. A classic dish done well. The all-dressed bagel had a couple of burnt bits, but it was otherwise delicious!2. Omertá on sesame bagel, pressed - the salami and mortadella were very savory, and the cheese was deliciously melted with the sandwich pressed. 3. Crab salad - imitation crab with celery, lightly dressed. It was pretty good, could have used a little bit more mayo.4. Salad of the day had cherry tomatoes, grapes, mango, and feta cheese dressed in a vinaigrette. A surprisingly good option!5. Plain cinnamon raisin bagel (to-go) - still warm out of the oven, very sweet and flavorful without any dressing, nice and crispy exterior with a tender interior.6. Rosemary and salt bagel (to-go) - also still warm out of the oven, really good combination of herbs and lightly salted without either being overpowering. Service was very friendly, and the lunch portions were filling and of good value (~$11-15 CAD each). The bagels are WORTH THE HYPE; I was visiting from New York and would recommend Montréal bagels in a heartbeat. I love that they are thinner and not so dense, and these were really crisp yet tender. They are also incredibly cheap; the bagels without cream cheese are a dollar each to-go! You must try this place, and get some bagels for the road!--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience.

This new location is pretty much what I always hoped for. You can have the excellent bagels that you can get from this franchise but now they prepare them for you on the spot so you can eat it there any way you practically want! This is a very welcomed innovation.The bagels are made on the spot... so fresh and warm.... the old Montreal bagel style everyone should try out at least once in their lifetime. The menu is pretty vast considering the amount of ways you can have your bagel prepared. Specialty bagels comes with sides of either soup or salad. Many varieties are given.I went with their BLT bagel and crab salad. Minus a mark for not having any soup available but... it was after all 8 PM. The crab salad was really good so it made up for this shortcoming. The BLT sandwich was excellent as well. I enjoyed my food!The service was very nice and efficient. No issues there as well.I did find the price tag to a bit higher since the sesame bagel by itself is sold for under a dollar but you get all the thrills with your bagel and you know what.... sometimes you have to splurge and go all out.Good times.

I typically don't eat my lox and cream cheese sandwiches with tomatoes and capers but they were perfect together in this instance. I also got a latte which was so, so yummy.We arrived around 10 am and got seated within minutes but by 10:15, there was a line out the door.

All of us are from NYC, so we were skeptical about trying out the main contender to NYC's renowned bagels. In the end, we all surmised that our roots held true and we were still bigger fans of our homegrown bagels, but the Montreal style bagels were still heavy contenders in their own right.Once we arrived at the location, there was a slight queue on which he had to wait on before we could get seated. The wait was pretty short, though, and we were seated just shortly after our arrival to the restaurant. The menu was large and had many options for those that happen to have certain dietary restrictions. I chose the vege deluxe sandwich on a sesame seed bagel with a side of their bean salad. I liked my sandwich a lot and I thought the bagel was good. Slightly chewier and a lot denser than a New York style bagel. Alas, I wish I had tried a plain bagel with cream cheese, but I was happy with my choice. Looks like they also had a load of pastries to choose from, which I sadly did not get to try. I did, however, come back here the morning of my drive back to NYC to pick up some bagels for the road. This place is cash only, unless you have a Canadian debit card. I think it's worth checking out if you happen to be in Montreal and have a hankering for their style of bagels."

The smoked salmon felt a little slimey and tasted more raw than it should've been. When the meal was done I felt 'forced' to give a tip that I wish I hadn't, with my server specifically stating that I give a 15% tip.

BUT,  I like carbs, and I don't judge on the source of my carbs, so yeah I feel I'm able to leave a review on these bagels. To start, I love the atmosphere of the cafe. Small & cozy, and you get a clear view of the massive ovens where the delectable bagels are made. I ordered the Italian bagel with a green salad & I was incredibly pleased. How can you go wrong with Italian meats on a sweet honey whole wheat bagel? The bagels automatically come crispy - but just the right amount. And they don't skimp on the toppings. Plus, with the large serving of greens you get, you don't feel as bad for stuffing your face. That's how it works. Next time I'm going to stick to a classic bagel and spread, though, because even though this was great, I don't feeI got the full tasting experience of the bagel itself."

I'm glad there's a cafe to properly indulge for Montreal's best bagels. Okay, first off there's nothing better than freshly baked bagels. They're warm, soft, crispy yet fluffy. They're delicious! And they typically mostly make the main three varieties in poppy seed, sesame, and plain, so I'd recommend getting a sandwich in either of those varieties; it makes a big difference. The whole wheat bagel we had for our smoked meat bagel was a tad stiff and didn't have the same softness of the fresh sesame bagel. The traditional (with smoked salmon and cream cheese) was my definitely my favourite of the two sandwiches I had here. Everything was so fresh and soft that I practically inhaled it. The smoked meat was really good too. I guess the value could have been more fair, $12.50 for one small bagel sandwich is definitely on the higher side.When you're done your meal, take some of their delicious freshly baked bagels to go."

Honestly, I don't think I've ever eaten so many bagels in my entire life. Was it worth it? Absolutely.I'm a lot more used to NYC bagels, but I think the bagels are too different to compare. I knew I wasn't going to be able to compare when I tried the all-dressed bagel, which I'm used to calling an everything bagel, from St-Viateur. I didn't like it because I felt like everything on the bagel overpowered the taste of the bagel. Montreal bagels are smaller, very lightly sweetened with honey, and a little chewier than NYC bagels. I tried almost all of the bagels with Liberte cream cheese and decided my favorite bagel there is the rosemary and sea salt bagel, with the sesame bagel as a close second. Wow! Since you see the oven popping out hundreds of bagels, you never really question the freshness of the bagels. The bagels are even better when they're still hot from the oven.Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to dine in but was very satisfied with the takeout orders.

I am still partial to the aesthetics of the Fairmount Bagel shop a few blacks away, but respect these guys for expanding but keeping the integrity intact.Montreal bagels are a real deal unique thing, and definitely worth checking out.  1-2 per person is quite reasonable, as they are smaller in diameter, but the wood fired crunch of the crust is really unique.  Super duper tasty.  Like many of these other reviewers, I am an expat NYer who is an unsufferable bagel snob (most of it is just round bread - curse you Einstein Bagels!!) but I really respect and appreciate this entirely different form.  If the gluten free thing was not sweeping the US right now I am sure you would see more of these guys in the south.  Till then - worth the trek!"

But, being from New York, I guess I have different expectations of what a bagel should be. Unlike NY bagels, these bagels are thinner and naturally crunchier without being toasted. What makes St-Viateur special, in my opinion, is that the bagels are made fresh right in front of you. You can visually see where your money is going. That being said, I still think $10 for a bagel with some smoked meat and mustard thrown on it is way too much. I don't think I'd be a repeat customer. Also, the space is small and very overwhelming. There's a line for if you want to be seated, a line for if you want to order to go and a line if you JUST want bagels. Proper signage would help a lot.

I watched the employees work the dough into a circle, dip it in honey water, and throw it in the oven. I watched them artistically slather cream cheese on it (unfortunately I asked for only a little and ended up wiping a lot off) and deliver it to me in a little white paper bag.I loved the thinness of the bagel and its vague sweetness.

You can get the bagel hot! They don't have as much variety as the competitor two blocks away, but the sesame bagel I had was just phenomenal. You can buy various cream cheeses in a fridge on the side. There are no tables, but a few sacks of flour you can sit on to finish your bagel if the weather is nasty outside. Remember, CASH only.

You could done in or take out. You could also watch as they made the bagels. Fresh dipped ok honey water then placed in wood fire oven. Melt in your mouth- dough was moist not dry at all. My friend got the Traditional and I got something different, as I had the Traditional before. Don't ever away like I did. Nothing compares to the Traditional with Sesame Seed Bagel (tasted my friend's)!!!Mine was great but not in comparison. We didn't rush. There is on small tv but people were mostly enjoying each other's company. Wifi available. Bathrooms located downstairs. Almost have to watch your step as you get caught trying to read some of the art and clippings on the wall Down. Cute decor and clean. FYI - they don't take visa, just debit and cash :). Suggestion: when visiting - go once to get the cafe experience. Then on the day before you leave - stalk up and take home! You may need additional carry on bag ;)! Or - just take a other trip back to Montreal!!!!!!"

From both places, we ordered 6 sesame bagels, ate one on the way home to really detect differences in textures and tastes, and brought the rest back to the AirBnB to enjoy with Liberté and gravlax. Fairmount wins, hands down. Both are chewy, both are easily the best bagels I've ever had, but the flavor of Fairmount bagels is way more present and unique. You can detect the slight sweetness in these bagels, whereas you can't tell it's there with St. Viateur's. Covered with shmear and gravlax, it's a tie. For just enjoying on their own (which you're supposed to be able to do with Montreal bagels!) I've gotta hand it to Fairmount. They know what they're doing just a little bit more."

The neighbourhood started getting sketchy and I realized I was walking in the wrong direction. Exit Metro to the right not left and the Bagel Cafe is a few blocks down.    Some patrons were enjoying their breakfasts , lattes, and teas in the open windows so it's like an indoor/outdoor patio. It was very welcoming. The waiter told us to sit wherever we'd like and handed us a couple menus. He also asked if we wanted coffee. Everything looked soo delicious. There's a blackboard menu offering cooling drinks, and a salad bar where they have the Bagel toppings and side displayed.    Behind the salad bar case is the wood burning brick oven where they make the Bagels Fresh. Such a fun process to watch, the dough is formed, dipped in honey water, sprinkled with poppy, sesame seeds, or 'all-dressed' and put in the Hot pit and then flipped and removed for Fresh Eating..mmm. My fiancé chose a bagel Sandwich with an omelette and Ham, and chose the side of Fruit salad that came in a nice glass cup. He ate it up, and proceeded to order a sesame bagel toasted with cream cheese. It came cut in half toasted, then sliced in half (4 pieces on the plate), and a side cup of cream cheese, was more than enough for his bagel.  I ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich and side salad. The smoked meat was plentiful ( came with a huge shmear-knife through it) and delicious. It came with mustard and cut pickles in side cups. The Salad was fantastic! It was baby greens and had plentiful Olives, thin sliced onion, tomato, and the house dressing was the best I've had! A nice horseradish bite to it it complimented the Smoked Meat perfectly and my man had some bites and was Jealous!Cool atmosphere here. The ceilings have than tin-tile look to it. There are flat screen tv's and I got to watch some Pink Panther cartoons- fun.  They also had Art for sale on the brick wall.   The service was good, nothing to complain about, just that you can tell they def don't overstaff here. You pay at the Cash, put your Tips back on the table.I would come back here in a heartbeat. The food Delish and the coffee was full of refills, we left very happy.

In the end, I ordered a fresh bagel, it was very tasty like I remembered. However, it was very hard to believe that I had to ask for a fresh bagel or all you get is a piece of stone.

I expected a lineup, but we got a table right away. I ordered a coffee and baileys and my partner had a smoothie. My coffee was great, but the smoothie was rather small for the price and was fairly warm when it arrived to the table. We ordered a few sandwiches and a salad and waited for almost an hour for our food. I was supposed to get a BLT with green salad, but I suspect I got the Greek salad that was on special. The plate was about half covered with chopped romaine, 4 slices of cucumber, 3 slices of mushy tomato and about a quarter cup of sliced black olives. My BLT had 1.5 slices of bacon and the bagel tasted almost stale and chewed up my gums. Neither meal was worth the wait. The waiter didn't bother to explain why every other person in the restaurant received their meal before us, even those who arrived 15-20 minutes after us. When I asked him about it he said it was a technical issue, something about the kitchen not getting the order, then kept telling me it was ""on its way"" and getting annoyed when I asked for an approximate timeline. We went on to wait another 20 minutes from that point. The open kitchen shows a prep line, and given our orders I can't comprehend why our meals couldn't be prioritized once the error was realized. When we paid, we didn't leave a tip and the man at the register asked us about it. We said we had a terrible experience and didn't feel a tip was warranted. The hot chocolate I ordered to go was tepid, so I'm guessing he didn't agree with us."

The place smells of an amazing aroma of fresh bread. You know that scene in Ratatouille when Emile (Remy's younger, fatter brother) experiences synesthesia for the first time with the cheese and grape pairing? I had that and I can still experience the awesome smells of the bagels.We ordered 12 bagels - 6 sesame and 6 cinnamon and raisin. I tried speaking in French and the dude behind the counter was happy and appreciated my effort. He looked like Khal Drogo but was nice as a button after we talked about how awful my French was and how Toronto was pretty dope.The venue where the bagels are sold is just in front of the humongous bagel machine. It was a huge machine that spewed tender and awesome goodness in the form of doughy circular deliciousness. You haven't had a bagel until you've had one fresh. I couldn't help eating them plain even throughout the ride home. I finally got back to Toronto and have half the amount of bagels left. By the next day, they were a little tougher but still amazingly good. Only after 3 days did they start getting tougher like the ones Dempster sells at the grocery mart. Mind you, this was 3 days opened and then it became as hard as a ""fresh"" bag from the grocery mart.I miss their bagels already... You MUST come here if you're Montreal. MUST!"

I have definitely had better-tasting bagels and this one didn't seem very fresh. The coffee was also weirdly strong -- I got it in the middle of the day so perhaps it wasn't very fresh either. The main reason for this review is that this was the worst, rudest service I got while in Montreal. I needed extra milk for my coffee and the waitress I started to ask waved me off and kept walking. I thought it was because she didn't speak English until I saw her speaking it to another table. It turns out she's just rude. I also bought a mug here for my mom and saw another waitress inspecting them while deciding which one to give me. I assumed that was for my benefit but when I got back to my hotel hours later, I saw that the label had weird black marks on it. It's hard to believe this was accidental given her scrutiny of the mugs. Look, I live in DC.

The rest of the table tried the Milano (ok.. not their best), Spicy Eggplant (really good) and the chicken (I didn't try that). I think its safe to say that my Salmon won hands down followed by the Eggplant. I could clearly see why so many people have reviewed it. The smoked salmon was really good (a bit too much cream cheese for me, but you can easily scrape some off). Bagels are not my favourite but i wouldn't mind trying this place again :)"

There was a line that started at the entrance but we didn't end up waiting that long eventually. We ordered a sesame traditional (with salmon and cream cheese) and a sesame jaws (with tuna salad). Bagels were super yummy and toppings were good. My salmon was still a bit frozen though, or maybe it was kept in a very very cold fridge...? Bagels are definitely worth trying. Service is good."

First off, I didn't find it terribly clean or inviting. There was a long line for take-away service, but not too many people waiting to be seated. The woman who seated us was very pleasant and communicative, but service was pretty underwhelming. The food was fine, I ordered the Le Traditionnel and it was OK, nothing great, nothing terrible. Basic bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and red onion. My boyfriend ordered the Meuh Meuh and it was pretty good. A very substantial amount of well-seasoned roast beef. I'm a New York transplant, so I'm probably biased, but this place does not impress or excite me. It all fell very flat for me - for such ""famous"" bagels, I expected a little more fanfare, but was met with a sort of wishy washy experience in a dingy spot."

I was very pleased and surprised with how much I loved these bagels! It definitely lives up to the hype! You are able to sit down and enjoy your bagel at this location. You can see where they cook their bagels also. I ordered the sesame bagel with lox and other toppings with a side salad. It was soft and chewy. I've noticed it was also a bit sweet but still so good! I wish this was much closer to me or else I would make the journey to Montreal for these bagels!!

The disappointing thing was that this place doesn't take credit card so as an American I had to reach down deep into my pocketbook for the last bits of change to pay for a sandwich. I wasn't able to afford the traditional sandwich but instead got the Le Plateau sandwich with pesto. Absolute perfection. Tastes so fresh and full of flavor. My vote's for this place as best in North America!

If you simply want to get a freshly made bagel to go, I would recommend going to any of the St. Viateur bagel factory shops instead. If you want to sit down and enjoy a delicious bagel sandwich with a side salad and maybe a cappuccino, then definitely come to this cafe instead. Do catch the attention of one of the servers first, and she/he will sit you. Make sure you have cash on hand, as this place only accepts cash now.

Slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It's not better than New York (I don't want a New Yorker to whack me), it's just different. Slightly smaller and maybe slightly sweeter.I took the Métro to Mont Royal station and walked the few blocks over to here.

Sooo as soon as I arrived to this beautiful city, trying a sesame bagel was one of the first things I did. I must say that even though I'm not a huge fan of sesame bagels, this bagel did not disappoint. It was thinner than the bagels I'm used to in the US. It reminded of a hot warm pretzel. It also was sweeter than the US bagels. I believe the bagels are dipped in honey which gives them the sweeter taste. The bagel was pretty good. The place is very small and the seating is limited. If ordering takeout, the process is pretty quick. Unfortunately,  I can't say the same for people trying to dine in. I would recommend getting a bagel to go.  It's also pretty cool to see them making the bagels in front of you. You can also get the bagels fresh from the oven. My bagel was warm, crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. You can order the bagel by itself, or as a sandwich. I almost forgot to mention that the chai tea was probably the best I ever had.

We then tried to get one of the three waitresses' attention so we could finally order, but still no luck there. All 4 waitresses on duty while we were there completely ignored us. After almost 20min waiting, I got up to ask a waitress for the menu. Then I had to get up once again to order a coffee, AND to order. So just to recap, not one single waitress came to our table. Oh and I also had to ask for water. Once we finally got our meal, both orders were wrong but we were so hungry that we said we'd just eat and pay. Once we waited so long to ask someone for the bill that I almost got up and walked out of the restaurant.

On our last visit, we got some dinner and a half a dozen bagels to bring back to our family in New York because we loved them so much.This cafe was our last stop before hitting the road back to the states.... about 3 hours into our drive, we stopped to get gas and I realized I left my small bag with my credit card, license and $200 sunglasses at this cafe. Obviously frantic, I contacted the owner at another location (it was 10PM and this location was closed), he was very kind and directed me to his brother who owns the Mont Royal spot. I spoke to him the next day and surprisingly they had my bag with ALL my stuff in it. Not only did they ship it to me that same week, they contacted me several times giving me shipping options (shipping from Canada is more expensive than waiting for them to come to the US a few days later to ship, etc.), sending me my tracking code, all for zero cost. ""Just come visit us the next time you're in Montreal,"" the owner said. Oh we definitely will! Great people, great food :)"

Really good tasting meal but found the bagels a little chewier than expected but I believe that's how they like them in Montreal lol. Also enjoyed the sweet potato soup and had a really great garlic and herb cream cheese side dish. Definitely try the herb and garlic.

The bagels in NY have a lightly crisp outer shell with a chewy pullable interior, not as dense as these. They're also bigger and have a fluffy element to them.

I came here while visiting Montreal with my husband and my parents. We heard they have the best, most well-known and authentic Montreal bagels. We came for a late breakfast, almost at lunch time. We waited for a long time for a table, which was fine & expected. When we sat, our server forgot to take our order. In the mean time, she was taking all of the orders at the other tables around us. We were confused as we hadn't been rude or done anything except stand and wait for our table. We were waving our hands, politely, to try to get her attention because we thought maybe she had forgotten about us as the restaurant was super busy. After about 30 minutes of waiting for her to take our order, she finally came over. She didn't apologize. We put in our drink orders first, and when she returned, she forgot some of our drinks. Normally this would be totally fine for us, but since we had already waited so long, we were getting impatient (And hungry). When she finally got us the correct drinks, we asked for some milk for our coffees, and she never ended up bringing it till the end when our drinks were finished. For our meals, we all ordered different bagel sandwiches. They were decent, nothing special, nothing to rave about. We are from New York State, so we can get amazing bagels close to home. Maybe our expectations for bagels are just high because we're New Yorkers. If you're in Montreal and want to try the bagels here for yourself, I'd say give it a go. You might be impressed, but we were not. I think the lower rating has something to do with the service and treatment, but it definitely isn't 4-5 star food in my opinion. We don't expect American service when we go abroad as we realize the standards and culture are different, but after being in various restaurants in Montreal, this was the only place where we had a problem with the service."

I always head to this bakery for bagels when I'm in Montreal (usually after brunch at L'Avenue Cafe).  The bagels are as fresh as it gets, and you can see them being made in front of your eyes.  Because the different flavours are made in batches, don't be surprised if they run out of a popular flavour.  If you're willing to wait another 20 minutes, it's likely you'll be getting a fresh batch when they replenish the flavours.  Cash only.  A crucial step is they pack the bagels in paper bags so they can cool off and the moisture is not trapped. A nice touch is providing enough bagel bags for storage later!  Worth the drive from Toronto to Montreal :)"

He put down the tip (about 15%, which was fair given that our server only refilled our coffee once even though only 4 tables were occupied and she overfilled his cup and shrugged instead of apologizing).Like many people, I don't like my tip sitting there looking all obvious while I am still finishing my last sips of coffee before leaving, so we put the tip money beside the plate that I had just finished eating from. As we were walking out of the restaurant, the waitress stopped me and said very loudly ""You know...tip is not included in the bill..."". I was taken aback. One, she said this loud enough so that my friend heard as well as the table that was directly beside where I was standing.Tipping is actually optional, not mandatory, but that is beside the point; we did tip: 15% and had she been paying attention and not jumping to conclusions, she would have easily seen this tip sitting right there, all ready for her.You can bet that I will never be bringing any clients, friends or anyone by this establishment again. I am not sure if this is just a jaded server or what, but her behaviour was completely unacceptable, uncalled for and downright rude."

/user_details?userid=jKuq3Vp4KCe53yclE7CYyw,Blake C.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"Two stars for the bagels being really great. Only two stars because the service is beyond horrendous. I don't mean it was slow, I mean the server was a rude human. 1. When the server brought our coffees, he spilled coffee all over my pants. He noticed, didn't apologize, didn't offer anything to clean my pants, and walked away. He simply didn't care. Coffee all over me, and he just moved on. 2. Minor point: I ordered a classic latte and he brought a cafe au lait. I told him that I ordered a latte and he informed me that at this restaurant, a cafe au lait and a latte are the same thing. A cafe au lait is coffee and milk (what we were given). A latte is espresso, steamed milk, and a little foam (what I ordered). All of Europe would cry if they knew of this travesty. 3. When we went to pay, we were informed that 15% is the standard to tip. Coming from the US, I agree with that. However, I reserve the right to tip less when a server spills coffee all over me. The person handling our check said we could tip a few bucks if we'd like. She then took a few bucks and put it in the tip jar. It's not a big deal, but it's super rude and condescending. Overall, I recommend getting a bagel to go and avoiding the coffee and the service."

The side salad of artichoke hearts was acidic and delicious as well. He proclaimed it the, ""perfect pre-flight meal"" that would carry him through the day of traveling ahead. I went basic. An all-dressed (everything) bagel. Toasted and served with rich, yet light and whipped in texture, sundried tomato cream cheese. The chewy bagel, fresh fruit, and cup of coffee was the remedy needed to get me going this Sunday morning. Service was a little slow, but so was I this morning.

We weren't trying to avoid a fee, tipping, or cheat the system. We were simply mistaken, and had we been corrected we'd have been happy to correct whatever it was that had upset this waitress so much.  Instead, we were given plates and knives with disdain and felt awkward as we tried to enjoy our bagels.Trust me, I would have preferred my bagel toasted! Had I understood how things worked I would have done it right. I would encourage staff to be a bit more patient. We never got any explanation of how to get seated service, so we were at a loss.Bottom line: for those who want the full bagel experience and are from out of town, don't walk up to the to-go counter by accident!

Honestly, they just aren't.They ARE perfectly fine and yummy with cream cheese. Make sure you get them hot and fresh from the oven and buy them from the bagel window, not the regular cafe counter. The latter charges $3.50 for a bagel with cream cheese. At the counter, a bagel is around 70 cents and you can buy a tub of cream cheese for two bucks. I made the mistake of paying the exorbitant price at the to-go cafe side--big mistake! Wish they made it more clear about the price difference :/The bagels are small compared to NY bagels too.

I agree, the bagel was great and the slight sweetness from being boiled with honey was there and it was nice. But, there were a few things lacking. The service was slow and the food took quite a while to arrive. I thought the menu needed more options other than sandwiches, salads, and bagels with spreads. I wanted to really try a bagel, so not in a sandwich, but if I did that my options were slim. To me a great bagel/breakfast place has plates with eggs and meat and a bagel instead of toast. I looked at the menu and tried to put that together, but I couldn't. All in all, I thought the bagel was very good, but it was not the spotlight when it's holding together a sandwich.

The bagel only got in the way of the flavor and tasted just like plain toasted bread.It's also a bit pricey, with most bagel sandwiches hovering around the $10 mark.

No tables there, but it was fascinating to see them making the bagel dough, cutting and rolling it into rounds, dunking the bagels in liquid, and sliding them into a brick oven on long, thin wooden palettes before dumping them with a flourish into a huge bin. The front of the store was filled with stacks of flour bags, there was a long line of customers picking up brown paper bags full of bagels to take home, and it all felt marvelously authentic. One of the workers was very kind and patient in mapping out the walk to the cafe, and off we went on the next part of our adventure.The cafe has some charm, especially the big wooden (?) bagels hanging on the storefront looking quaintly Old World. Unfortunately, our experience inside wasn't the best. My Long Island friends ordered the Traditionnel bagels with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and red onion. They weren't all that impressed, particularly not thrilled about the denseness of the bagels. (Clearly this is a matter of personal taste, but we all prefer a bagel that is tender under a chewy crust.) I had a multi-grain bagel which was very heavy and dense. My first reaction was that it would be something to feed to a horse. We did enjoy the fruit cups. Our server was perfectly nice, but when I asked for more hot water in my tea press, she came back with a coffee press. Ick. I also ended up with a fly in my water, not a big deal, but the overall cleanliness of the place was a bit lacking. Finally, the little breakfast ended up seeming rather expensive. Sadly, I wouldn't go back."

You pick up a few single serving Philadelphia cream cheese pads from the fridge and pay less than a buck for a fresh bagel.The warmth of the bagel combined with just the right amount of chew puts any west coast US bagel to shame.

I don't understand French very well but I know enough to see that there's different types of bagels to choose from, yet he failed to ask me which type I want. I'm also confused with how a place in Montreal would only have French and no English menus... either he's having a really bad day and taking it out on customers or he's just very racist. With that being said though, the bagels are no doubt very fresh and crispy. I'm not huuuuuge in bagels though so with that kind of customer service I'll probably never come back here again.

/user_details?userid=vWj8mF_Bkz2Wa7LuiAvVaQ,Jenny H.,"Saratoga, CA",5 star rating,"Most amazing bagel I've ever had!! First time having the Montreal style bagel that has no salt and a bit of honey in the dough, which is poached in honey water then baked in a wood fire oven. The bagel is super crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and not dry at all. I prefer the smaller size compared to NY style bagels too.  At St-Viateur I tried a turkey bagel sandwich and a bagel with just smoked salmon spread and the smoked salmon one was definitely the winner by far. I think I could use that spread on any bread and make it taste good and it was truly heavenly paired with the toasted sesame bagel. The turkey bagel sandwich was good but probably would tasted much better if the turkey and cheese were warm and melted.Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal!"

It's iconically Montreal and always jam packed. Be prepared to queue up and get your bagels quickly. if you're driving, you can run back to the car with your bagels and have a bite... No place to sit which is a bit junky.Travelling by metro (Mont-Royal) this time, this was my first visit to a St-Viateur Café. First and foremost, who doesn't love the Plateau? Such a great neighbourhood with a ton on the go. I don't need to sing the praises of these bagels. They are the best. SO YUMMY. The perfect amount of sweetness, density and chewiness. The café concept means bagel sammies, salads and coffee. The idea of picking up a dozen bagels and then sitting with a freshly made bagel is pretty awesome. My sesame bagel was perfect and piping hot with first bite. I had a piece of my friends cinnamon raisin bagel and you could smell the cinnamon. Awesome!Any good visitor to 514 should bring these bagels back to family and friends. Do it. You'll be loved forever."

Their wood burning fire produces warm, flaky, crispy bagels with a hint of honey. So flavorful, you can eat it just by itself. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 sesame bagels with butter and cream cheese. Their coffee wasn't bad either. Memorable breakfast. Nice cafe to hang out.Only downside is the price. For 2 bagel & extra condiments, we easily went over $6. The walk to St Viateur from the metro station made for a great walk through the Mont -Royal neighborhood."

After reading reviews, I was determined to have it on the original sesame as everyone said its the best option. They brought it out on an all-dressed. The waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there, and told us we weren't allowed to use a larger table for the 2 of us (we had bags) despite the place being near empty.... The extra bagel with your sandwich doesn't make sense to be $1.50 when I can buy one off the board for 85c. Very confused.

/user_details?userid=6g0k1ogM5-_DQZW7X6opMQ,Erik T.,"Asbury Park, NJ",4 star rating,"Well, First off, I'd like to say I've been wanting to try the Montreal style bagel since I've heard about it. Eating bagels from NYC and NJ I have to say i've been pretty spoiled. With that aside, these funny looking bagels give NYC a run for it's money! Unlike the ""traditional"" bagel, these are skinnier bagels with a larger hole in the center, and a sweeter taste. When I was looking into bagels I looked into a variety of places, I chose this location, (avenue du Mont-Royal), for it's location close to the metro. This is a cute cafe style shop that has seats and a counter to order from. This place was PACKED on a Sunday. The line was out the door right after we were seated. Then menu has a a wide selection of sandwiches, salads (with bagel chips) and sides. They also offer plain bagels and other baked treats. The service was ok, I have to remind myself that it's not NYC and we need to wait.... the owner actually came over and checked on us while waiting (which was nice). While looking over the menu, I chose the polet St-Viateur sandwich, (chicken marinated in lemon and herbs with either pesto or mayo)... I chose pesto with a green salad on the side, sandwich on a sesame bagel. My friend chose the omelet sandwich, eggs with ham (he subbed bacon) and added cheddar. Yum! The sandwich was awesome! Only complaint was the bagel was cold. But besides that I got a BIG hunk of chicken on a yummy bagel with a mixed green salad (yummy Dijon vinaigrette). The price.... eh, It was worth it, but it wasn't very cheap... 12,50.... but it didn't seem there were any bargains in Montreal. I'd seriously recommend this location if in the city. P.S. Don't expect a NY style bagel."

However, the food falls into a category of its own. For Americans, these bagels differ from the ones back home, as here they are denser and crispier on the outside. One would think this would make them harder to bite into, but on the contrary, the bagels are the perfect softness because of how fresh they are. Out of what we ordered, the traditional (smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions, capers, and lemon) was the best. If you're debating whether or not to go here- stop your debating and drop by. The food is amazing."

But so are 99 per cent of other places that make bagels.The major factor playing a role in what makes this bagel different if you can notice at all is the the fact that you can grab it straight out of oven unlike Starbucks or Tim Hortons which have to be delivered and reheated.  In conclusion, if this is the best that bagels can be I would say it's worth a go just to say you've been there, done that but don't expect something you've never experienced before.  Especially if you have it built up in your mind that you're face is going to explode with deliciousness like I had."

Their soup of the day was good-- a chicken, veggies, and pasta soup, and their bagel sandwiches were great! The bagels really make it worth visiting. Oh and I had pesto with my sandwich--a flavorful combo as I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise. The seating was okay. I went with a group of 6 and most of the seating is for smaller groups but they were able to accommodate us well when other people cleared out. I thought the service was also good, despite the busy hour that we went. In the end, I regret not bringing a bag of bagels home with us, but at least we got to try them!"

It is near-impossible to find a good bagel in my town, so I was very excited to learn that the apartment we were staying in was located above a bagel shop! Let me tell you, waking up to the smell of freshly baked bagels is a great way to start the day.Our first visit was for a late dinner. I had a bagel sandwich that involved ham and pesto, along with a side salad. It was delicious, but the bagel played second fiddle to the tasty fillings, so I knew we had to come back to try some bagels on their own. I had a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese - pretty basic, but it's the standard by which I judge any bagel purveyor. Note: the seating in the shop is only if you want table service. So we were forced to take our bagels to go, and intended to find a suitable place to consume them. But they smelled so good that we stood right outside on the sidewalk and scarfed them down. It was pretty great. So even if you can't have the pleasure of sleeping above a bagel shop, St-Viateur is worth a stop!"

Other times however, I would have had a slight problem with it.   Fiancee ordered the Beef soup of the day, a bagel with cream cheese and jelly and a bowl of hot chocolate. (Yes, bowl...) I decided on a Glass of milk, flavored hazelnut coffee (turned out to be alcoholic), the omlette and ham sandwich bagel and a side of crab salad. Food wait time was approximately 9 minutes from order till complete. We got the drinks first, the soup second, and the bagels last. Snapped some pictures for your enjoyment as everything we had was pretty tasty. However I had  a unbelievably difficult time eating mine due to the hardness of the bagel squishing the egg out of it causing quite a mess. The hot chocolate actually had chocolate whipping cream on top and was great on a day where it was below freezing at the time. Like I said before I got a hazelnut coffee but I was expecting it to just be flavored, not spiked. Which is odd when you take into consideration that the menu has 2 separate sections ""Flavored"" and ""Spiked"" I drank it anyway even though I didn't fully enjoy it. The crab salad had a large amount of Dill in it, and to anyone who is a fan of this herb should give it a whirl. Large chunks of crab with dill and a very light amount of either mayo or some other sauce served on a bed of lettuce. All in all the service was good, the servers were friendly and I would recommend giving this place a shot just so long as you don't mind a few of the items to be a bit on the spendy side."

/user_details?userid=mXeiNnPvLG3VsvXtz5PNSg,Joy C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"The service is so bad that I actually have to write a review for the first time in my life. My boyfriend and I came all the way from Toronto and after some research we discovered that this was one of the must try's in Montreal. The moment we stepped into the place, nobody came to greet us even after we roamed around the place trying to find a good spot as we thought it was a self serve place. We found a 4 seat table and decided to take it as we have some bags with us (there were 2 other 4 seaters that were occupied only by 2 people). The waiter who seemed like the boss rushed over and told us to move to the 2 seater beside it (in an unwelcoming manner). We sat down for literally a minute, he came over to take our order, and my boyfriend told him we weren't ready. He came back in three minutes and we were clearly not ready, my boyfriend ordered since he seemed very pushy and I was still deciding. He just stood there even when I told him I wasn't sure. A normal response would've been  ""Take your time"", ""I'll be right back"", or ""Let me know when you are ready"". Just to clarify, the place wasn't even busy at all. There were at least 5 empty tables. I was so rushed that I actually just picked something random. Five minutes later, my boyfriend asked which bagel I picked and I told him I didn't pick anything. We realized that the waiter didn't even ask. I came up to him and asked him which bagel he picked for us and all he said was oh just regular sesame bagel because you didn't tell me. I didn't know what to say after his response. It was the waiter's job to ask (unless the menu specified that if you didn't notify the server of your preference, it would automatically be sesame bagel). After we were done our meals, my boyfriend took out his card and placed it on the table, not knowing that we had to go up to the cashier to pay. The waiter didn't bother to let us know even though we sat right next to his station and he was just basically chatting and had definitely noticed that we were ready to pay. After 10 mins, we got up to pay (realized that we had to pay at the front) and went back to our table to put on our jackets and were ready to leave, the server never said a word to us. (WE SAT NEXT TO HIM!!!!!) Not even a goodbye. This experience was definitely one of a kind, the kind that would make you never want to return. P.s. the food was meh, the toppings seemed like the ones you could buy at a supermarket. Bagel was definitely better than Tim Hortons, but nothing spectacular."

/user_details?userid=K7BdIBTVVcYaLh8VNGm8fA,André N.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",2 star rating,"As we were being greeted by our waiter, I felt right away that something was askew. There was a strange vibe in the air with very distinct snobbish overtones. Even though we had been speaking French as we were seating ourselves, because, well being Frenchies from Sorel (the ugliest town in Québec--it used to be far prettier), the little smartass waiter tries to score points (tipping points, I soon found out) by speaking to me in English--was it because I was speaking loud? I thought I was not the only loudmouth in Québec!  Anyways, one the bill arrived for the two coffees ($3 for an espresso, the most expensive for this city, although it did taste great--no surprise here since it was coffee roasted at UNION on Jean-Talon Street--arguably the best coffee in town (by the way check out the Caffe Italia at 6840 St. Laurent, Blvd, which also uses a Union coffee blend). the bill read--in both official languages-- ""TIP IS NOT INCLUDED"", which I at this point I had unconsciously expected, and the Interact machine I used to pay even suggested different tipping scenarios, i.e, 15, 17 and 20%. Another sore point: the percentage was calculated with the sales taxes already factored in (not fair), So just as I had expected, their ""classy"" demeanor was just a ply to get big tips. Never again. And since the Starbuck`s in another coffee shop on Mont-Royal staffed by infantile snobs, there remains the friendly Second Cup not far away on the same street."

/user_details?userid=jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,Andy G.,"Fairfield, ME",4 star rating,"Every so often during my hectic, stress filled life, I like to take a break and just relax. I stop to smell the roses ( or whatever odor is around me), listen to the birds chirp their happy song or watcha little paint dry. The St Viateur Bagel and Cafe is that kind of place. It has two cafe locations in Montreal. Simone and I choose the cafe at 1127 Mont. Royal East. Its a little out of the way ( probably a mile or so off the subway) in the ""Plateau"" European district of Montreal, but worth the walk even during those rather frost bitten winter days. At this small cafe their specialty is Jewish style bagels baked in a wood burning oven all day long. You can have the traditional bagels with Lox ( a gross combo of Smoked salmon, raw onion and capers with some other junk on a platter) or with some of their flavored cream cheeses. They also have lots of specialty sandwiches featuring their bagels for the lunch crowd.After walking from the subway on a cold morning with the snow lightly falling, Simone and I walked into the cafe which features an open kitchen so you can watch the bagels being made and hand rolled all day long.  We found a seat next to the window, but away from the drafts from the door at the entrance. You seat yourself (or at least we did ) and then the waitress or waiter takes your order. If you don't know your French lingo then they are well prepared for you, as they offer both French and English versions of the menu. Simone and I both opted to start with some hot chocolate to warm ourselves up.  The hot chocolate was made fresh and not from a packet. It was rich and topped with a little whipped cream and was an excellent choice.  After sipping on the hot chocolate we ordered our bagels. It it was breakfast time, so we opted out of the sandwich options and went for the basics.  We both ordered a Multigrain Bagel ( seriously, why does my wife insist on always getting the same thing as me ?).  To keep things healthy, I ordered mine with a side of sun dried tomato cream cheese. Simone ,with her never ending sweet tooth had hers with the chocolate cream cheese.The bagels arrived with-in about five minutes with a small side of fresh fruit on the plate. Unfortunately, the fresh fruit in these parts during the winter months tends to be pretty tasteless, and this fruit fit into that category. So onto the main course, the Bagel. Jewish Bagels are denser then your New York variety that you usually find in the supermarket, and this makes them a little less chewy and usually moister.  The Bagels at St Viateur were done to perfection.  Hand rolled with lots of seed and oats, they arrived hot with a crunchy exterior from the wood burning oven ,but dense, doughy and moist on the inside. The bagels are cut for easy dipping into the side of cream cheese that comes in a 2oz souffle cup filled past the top. The cream cheese is also super rich and super good, and although its a lot of cheese, its good enough that you will find yourself finishing it all and licking the utensil of your choice at the end to make sure you don't leave any behind.Simone and I both finished off our entire plate and were pretty full at the end of it all. We paid the bill and rolled ourselves back out into the frozen Montreal tundra happy with our choice. St Viateur Bagel & Cafe is a nice country cafe to sit back and relax and get a good and hearty start to your day. Four Stars ****"
/user_details?userid=HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I am not a bagel fan, and don't usually eat bagels... But that rule goes out the window when I'm in Montréal.  After having been introduced to Montréal bagels, it is always a foodie souvenir that I bring home to family and friends.  My only dilemma is that bagels are quite bulky, and so now when I go to Montréal I have to keep tally of who I should and shouldn't tell before I end up knee high in excess baggage fees while toting home bagels... They'd probably arrest me for poaching :pThis particular location is both a sit-down and take-out shop.  The line-up was mostly for the take-out section of the shop, and with just one lonely old man manning the cash register - things got a little bit hectic.  When one of the waitresses saw that the line-up was growing, she came over and started taking orders and bagging bagels while repeating the orders to the gentleman at the cash register to ring it up.  While I appreciate her effort and teamwork-driven attitude, this actually made things worse.  I had ordered a dozen sesame bagels and also picked up 2 tubs of the National Herring Co.'s smoked salmon cream cheese (a MUST buy!).  A Montréal bagel without the National Herring Co.'s smoked salmon cream cheese is like eating a cupcake with no icing.  I always have a habit of double-checking my shopping bags, not because I'm paranoid that everyone is out there to rip me off - but because I realize that orders are prone to human error.  Sure enough, when I looked inside my bag, there was only 1 sole bag of 6 bagels... Luckily I checked, otherwise, my mob of bagel-promised friends would be attacking me like hyenas.  All in all, I am a big fan of the St-Viateur Bagels.  However, I think the next time I go, I will go to a take-out only location.  4 stars for the bagels themselves, 3 stars for the service..."

/user_details?userid=C2BFqOa0BErC2246cvli2A,Lisa G.,"Andover, MA",4 star rating,"DH and I are bagel fans - my parents are from Brooklyn, DH and I lived in NYC, and even found a place in Arlington MA that imported bagel dough from H&H. So when we heard that Montreal bagels were a ""thing"" we knew we wanted to try them. We arrived for a late breakfast and were told to sit where we liked. We were handed an english menu (yes, sadly obvious from my ""pour deux"" that we needed one). Service wasn't warm, and was a bit flaky (I got a regular coffee instead of the espresso I ordered, server forgot what type of bagel I ordered and to ask DH what kind of bagel he wanted on his sandwich). But she was busy and honestly for a casual place, small issues (the regular coffee was good, much more important). Although her english seemed good (better than my french!), maybe the language barrier was the issue. We had regular OJ (pulpy, which we liked) which came in a pretty glass with orange slice garnish, cute. Coffee filtre, strong enough with good taste. I had a toasted poppy bagel with butter and jam - bagel was really good, and not too sweet to my taste. Definitely smaller than american bagels, not as chewy as NY bagels, but not puffy like Dunkies bagels (a good thing, in my book). Nice amount of poppy seeds. The butter/jam was in little plastic containers like you'd get in a diner (fine). It came garnished with a couple of small slices of cantaloupe. DH had a sesame bagel (also very good) with omelette, ham and pesto. It was really a delicious sandwich - the omelette was puffy (egg only, as far as I could tell) over several slices ham. The pesto came on the side, in a small cup (probably two to three generous tablespoons - more than enough), was delicious itself, and complemented the other ingredients. DH also had a fruit salad (more of a fruit cup, but fine, fresh). They didn't take credit cards - and we were out of Canadian cash - but kindly took American cash (and gave Canadian change) without any eye-rolling. The bagels are good - but we decided we didn't need any extras to take on the road. If you can't get decent bagels where you live, these are pretty to very good. And I certainly think this is a nice place to stop in for a sandwich. The neighborhood is interesting (used book stores and vinyl shops, clothes shops and other restaurants)."
