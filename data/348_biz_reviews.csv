Their mushroom pizza (with vegan mozzarella, 2 varieties of mushrooms, herbs, and pesto) tasted so legit! Their pizza with Beyond Meat sausage was scrumptious as well and it was indistinguishable from real sausage. They also offer other veganized Italian delicacies such as tiramisu, arancini, calzone, crab cakes, and lots more on their regular (i.e. non-COVID) menu. It's also one of the rare classy vegan restaurants that you can bring a date to. Their pizza was so thick and hearty and huge that I could only manage to eat 3/4. Given my voracious appetite, that says something.  The price (18$ for pizza) is reasonable given the portion size and quality of the food. I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely like to return."

It has an elegant yet cozy and  casual atmosphere, using white colors that brings brightness to the place. We ordered the fritto Misto which are fried mushrooms that are inspired by calamari, we had as well aubergines with vegan mozzarella cheese (this was delicious, should be a must), sauted rapini, and as main course we ate tortellini filled with spinach and ricotta and tagliatelle with a bolognese sauce that used TVP insteadof beef. The food is 100% vegan, but it is so good that you don't even notice it. The service was great, the waiter took his time to explain the menu dish by dish and made some great suggestions. It is a very good italian vegan restaurant."

I've been here a few times with friends and have had a chance to try many dishes on their ever-changing menu. The atmosphere is chic yet relaxed and the staff are super nice. It's a small restaurant where you often get glimpses of the chef preparing her masterpiece. While not vegan myself, I've enjoyed most dishes I've tried. Last time I was here, we started with the ""antipasti del giorno"" ($15) which was a platter of different vegetables, served with fresh bread and vegan cheese. The texture of the cheese was spot on, sort of like a spreadable goat cheese. I've tried 5 different pastas and I found it was kind of hit or miss. The last time I had the gnocchi and the ravioli which was filled with vegan sausage and served with onions and potatoes. I didn't like the gnocchi at all. I found the sauce way too creamy and the texture of the pasta was off. The ravioli was absolutely delish. The prices are a bit high but still reasonable.Overall, excellent concept and atmosphere. The food has been a bit hit or miss which becomes tricky with a menu that is always changing because if you love a dish, it might be tough to be able to order it again. Overall 3.5 stars"

Radis is a vegan Italian restaurant where they use product such as Beyond Meat and plant-based cheese. What distinguished between meat protein and plant-based protein? Personally what stands out the most is the texture but not in a bad way at all. Truthfully, if I didn't mention that it was vegan that detail wouldn't even matter to begin with because of how well they executed the flavours. Out of all the 8 dishes we received, only one dish needed a little tweak. But hey, taste is so personal.What genuinely makes me even more attracted to this restaurant is the fact that the owner and head chef/owner of Radis made the price point of every dish from $15.00-$28.00. Trust me, I've been to restaurants where the bill can literally look like half your rent and they don't even deserve as much recognition as these guys do. She's asked me: ""Why should I put a higher price point? Because it's trendy? That is not my business motto and that's just not right. I want people to come to my restaurant and feel like home."" We can here for brunch but I genuinely feel like I'll be coming back really soon for their dinner and wine service. Radis is a vegan Italian restaurant that deserves a 9/10 in my book. PS. Expect a huge amount of Radis post for the next couple of days."

The fricassée had beyond sausage, portabella and potatoes in a delicious jus, and the rosti was fresh and hearty with cashew cheese and vegan caviar and crisp carrot ribbons. The limonata was a nice touch and the tiramisu quite substantial!Next time I'll be sure to try the calzones, they looked very appetizing."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is overwhelmingly good. Like, it's everything and more I could have hoped for in a small Italian vegan resto. Heck, I'm not even sure I'm familiar with an omnivore Italian spot I'm as smitten about. I have no doubt that this place is going to get very popular very quickly; be sure to get a reservation when visiting.We started off our meal with the faux calamari plate, which was difficult to distinguish from the real thing and was delish- I found the plate a little much for two people but I also don't eat deep fried stuff too often. We continued with the stuffed (cashew cheese) deep fried zucchini flowers, which, on the contrary went by way too fast. As our main we shared the pizza di Eva which was perfect: I love their house ricotta and mozzarella and I'm seriously very picky about my vegan cheeses. These paired great with the beyond meat sausage they have on the pizza. Finally, we ordered both the chocolate and vanilla/pistachio cannolis, which were a bit overkill with everything else but still hella tasty. Speaking to drinks, we were really delighted to find an affordable old world orange on the menu we weren't already familiar with. Chilled properly, the Humus we selected really brought the whole meal together.Otherwise the service was aloof yet delightful and the space is incredibly welcoming while very tastefully designed and decorated. My only qualm with the space is the strangely sexist sign they have for the bathrooms (the one where a dude is peaking over his stall into the women's stall)- why have awesome gender neutral bathrooms if you're going to have a sign like that? Anyways, it did not dissuade us from falling in love with Radis; I can't wait to bring everyone here."

/user_details?userid=gr28gZBtSon2Irey9JtcFw,Jeremy D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the best Italian restaurant in Canada. I bring non-vegan friends here all the time and they think it's amazing, oh and by the way it's vegan and it's so good.  Try the fresh pasta, Calzones, actually anything on the menu, you can't go wrong."
/user_details?userid=J-jkOI8to1e6gjUD_tdf7Q,Jordan P.,"Allston, MA",5 star rating,"This is what vegan cuisine is all about! Simple, flavorful, absolutely delicious. We had the ravioli (spinach, pesto, and fleurs), the focaccia, and the vanille & pistache cannoli. Flawless! Oh & the restaurant itself is gorgeous."
/user_details?userid=ktmQ8qkHMqdQE-5TuTrbTQ,Kristin J.,"Geneva, NY",5 star rating,"Best restaurant in Montreal! Hands-down some of the most amazing meals we've ever had. Went back 2 nights in a row! We enjoyed the arancini, pasta a la Norma, mushroom bisque, mushroom pizza, vanilla & chocolate cannoli. The place is small, but quaint and pretty. The servers were genuinely friendly and knowledgeable. We'll be back just to eat here!"
