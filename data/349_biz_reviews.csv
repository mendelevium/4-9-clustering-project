Their lunchtime menu offers a brilliant selection of French-inspired staples as well as poutines, salads, burgers, grilled cheeses and tartares. I had a very simple cheddar grilled cheese, which ranks as one of the best I've had in the city so far: a melty delight with crispy buttery bread, which went great with a glass of chilled Sauvignon Blanc. High marks for the friendly, laidback service as well - we hardly had to wait for our dishes to be served, and although our choices were admittedly easy to prepare, we appreciated that our busy schedule was catered for. All for a very reasonable price: my grilled cheese was $12!All in all a great experience. Would definitely recommend."
/user_details?userid=PALLpd-wFfmp48inCockgg,Shaun Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Five star for the service. The waitress was just so charming and danced to serve food to each customer. We ordered two pieces of fish and chips and it was enough for two people. The taste was decent and the price was reasonable.

So fresh and delicious!  My guest's burger was also really tasty!  My only criticism is that the fries are too thin, that makes them get too cold too easily.  They were piping hot, but I had to eat them quickly.  Maybe crinkle cut?  That's still diner-ish.  Definitely give this place a try, and leave them a good review! :)"

/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"La dinette is the latest endeavor in Mado's bid to reign over the city - which I am all for! Mado used to say that she would run for mayor, and one day we would all vote pink. I am still waiting for that day, but in the meantime we have the dinette.The place is very new - they hadn't printed the drinks menu yet - and it keeps evolving: one time you'll have your food served on a plate, then the next it'll be in a bowl, things like that. I love the idea of having a nice cozy place to chill while waiting for a drag show, but I was a bit let down. My sangria was mainly water, and since I didn't get to see the price, I realized while paying that my glass cost as much as a meal. I wasn't won over my the black bean burger either, the patty was flavourless and mushy, so much so that I asked my waiter for hot sauce and salt/pepper. The highlight here was the maple bacon poutine, which was christened ""the best in Montreal"". It was slightly sweet, savoury, just great. But then on another night, the magic didn't operate and it fell flat. I don't have the heart to put 2 stars, I'm sure these are just growing pains..."

I was not sure if it was just me who didn't like it, but it obviously depends on the restaurant. I ordered the pork poutine and it was flavourful and a huge portion. Enough for a meal. If you are in the area and craving for poutine, this is the place."

The decor, the choice of music and the service is impeccable.We had the burgers. They were great. I think it could have a bit more cheese in the poutine but it was good anyway."

The staff treat you like you're an old friend dropping in and you can stay as long as you like.The menu is small, basic and I've yet to have a bad dish. One small issue was their veal medallions which are wrapped in bacon. This isn't mentioned in the menu, I don't eat pork so just unwrapped the medallions."
/user_details?userid=n-q6jHg_rx289M7b3qlS0Q,Tonya M.,"Albany, NY",4 star rating,Recommended by the BB we stayed in and first place we went to upon our late night arrival. This place is great-we we're able to get a few drinks and grilled cheese. Grilled cheese was far better than your American fake cheese sandwich-- one with Brie and caramelized onions the other with a rich blend of Cheddar. Waiter offered salad instead of fries this was much appreciated and the salad was basic spring mix with light balsamic dressing. Over all this little dinner is an excellent upgrade that you usually find in Jersey(although you do compromise the vast variety of a Jersey menu).
