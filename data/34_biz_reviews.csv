/user_details?userid=Ei127XW-Am6KWSYx3poVnw,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An absolute delight in the mouth! This place although a little on the pricier side, has some DELICIOUS pizza. The crust is perfectly crisp (not soggy like some other places) and they've got a huge selection of pizza toppings and options. It was a super busy dine-in and takeout pizza place pre-covid times, but it's just as busy for takeout nowadays.I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants ""real"" pizza, not fast food pizza."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was able to squeeze  in Il Focolaio on their last night for 2020 and so glad I did. Despite the fact that my last experience wasn't as expected, this time around it definitely met my expectations.I indulged in their Phillip Square and Tartufo pizza along with their Italian salad. Pizzas were so different yet  extremely tasty and satisfying without that heavy feeling. One was like an all-dressed with a variety of meats  and the other more cheesy drizzled with black truffle. No wonder they are listed as their most popular pizzas. As for the Italian salad, it was fresh just like a summer day. Perfect mix to accompany the meal. Staff was extremely kind and helpful. If you're craving pizza and in the area, drop by!"
/user_details?userid=s7BCkfv0ukbYZbVO6xLTjA,Shy J.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Pizza Focolaio is a small place situated roadside in Montreal downtown having both inside and outside seating. Hard to miss as it is probably the only place in the surroundings which was almost packed. We reached there around 10:20 on a Friday night; 10:30 was the closing time but the place was still buzzing in with crowd.They have an extensive menu with more than 70 pizzas to chose from including vegetarian and gluten free options - Definitely heaven for a pizza lover (that would be me). We ordered two pizzas, La Bomba and Romana. We were four people and the pizzas with drinks were enough for us. Romana was nice but highlight of the evening was La Bomba. Tried Broccoli and A La Griglia in my another visit. One word - DELISH!!!Verdict - Pizza Focolaio is a lovely place and should be in your must visit restaurants if you are in Montreal. The service was good as well. Affordable rates with Pizzas starting at 13.25. Great food. Definitely Going back again and again to explore other options on their menu."

It had really good reviews so we decided to give this place a shot.When we entered, there was a long line up so we decided to dine out. The service was really friendly - they offered us some water and were very patient even if we took like 10 minutes to choose so I'll give 5/5 for the service.We waited 15 minutes for the pizza which was quite fast considering how busy they were. We ordered the Romana and Italian Hawaiian pizzas. Saying that their pizza is great is an understatement - it deserves way more than that. Their pizza crust is thin and crunchy (and not soggy at all!). They are generous with the amount of toppings they put too - both of our pizzas were cheesy (just how I love it) and flavourful.Overall, I had a great experience here and I recommend to every pizza lover out there to check this place out."
/user_details?userid=M9c8LYSxMkaNoRBYTTZIjg,Amelia M.,"Stewart Manor, NY",5 star rating,"Where do I even begin? My husband and I stumbled across this place because it was our last day in Montreal and we were definitely craving pizza. I'm so glad we found this place because when I tell you this is one of the  best pizzas I've ever had, I mean that! And I'm from NY, that's a big thing for a New Yorker to say (haha). They have an EXTENSIVE menu with all different kinds of toppings. I, of course opted for the simple margherita pie and it was phenomenal. It was my first meal of the day and normally I'm not a heavy eater that early, but I definitely devoured most of the pie myself! My husband opted for one of their house specials, had pepperoni, sausage & peppers. That too was so delicious! I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're in downtown Montreal. You will not be disappointed. They have a great wine menu as well! I had a house white sangria & my husband had a beer. Service was great too, our waiter was very helpful when we were choosing our pizza selections and was attentive. All in all, will def be returning. 10/10 food 10/10 service 10/10 drinks"
/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Daniel B.,"Atlanta, GA",3 star rating,"I had high hopes for Il Focolaio considering the restaurant's prevalence and history in Montreal (since 1984). Plus, it had a great rating and large number of reviews on Yelp. We ordered delivery. Service was good, but the pizzas, unfortunately, were just not that good. They also got one of our orders wrong.Don't get me wrong. The pizzas weren't bad. I was just expecting better.Our group, which was staying in some apartments near McGill University, wanted pizza to be delivered for dinner. I searched Yelp and Il Focolaio seemed like the best choice. They had a clean, professional-looking website with a detailed, up-to-date menu. My friends and I could easily choose what we wanted before I called in the order.Il Focolaio had nearly 80 different kinds of pizza to choose from, most priced in the $15-17 range, each (Canadian dollars). All of Il Focolaio's pizzas are ""individual"" size at 10-11 inches each. They have pizzas to fit various taste preferences, allergies, and dietary restrictions including ingredients like omega-3 (vegan) whole wheat pizza dough, gluten-free vegan crust, and organic lactose-free cheese. In addition, they sell calzones, salads, subs, sausage plates, and desserts. They also offer a full bar with beer, wine, and cocktails.We took advantage of their ""order 3 and get the 4th one free"" delivery special. For every 4 pizzas you order, the cheapest pizza of the 4 is free. We ordered on a Saturday night and there were no weekend restrictions for this special.Here's what we got (with menu numbers):5. Sicilienne ($15.75) - sauce, ham, mushrooms, mozzarella, green peppers; this one had no mushrooms at our request28. Peperonata (free from the buy 3, get one 1 free deal; regularly $15.50) - sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella34. Hawaiian ($17.75, includes $2 addition for vegan cheese) - sauce, ham, pineapple, mozzarella, black olives, sub in vegan cheese; we requested no olives68. A La Griglia ($16.50) - fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, grilled vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, onions, artichokes, mushrooms, green and red peppers), fresh garlic, Italian herbs, olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano74. Tartufo ($16.50) - mozzarella, goat cheese, black truffles (mixed with anchovies, olives, fresh garlic, wine, corn oil), cherry tomatoes (with fresh garlic, oregano, basil, olive oil), Parmigiano-ReggianoThese fives pizzas sufficed for the seven of us. My favorites were the Peperonata and Sicilienne in that order. The other pizzas were disappointing. I specifically requested no olives on the Hawaiian and our receipt confirmed this. However, they still included lots of olives on the pizza. I understand mistakes happen, but this was a pretty simple request and they messed it up. The pizza was okay otherwise.The Peperonata was standard and the Sicilienne was okay too. Il Focolaio makes everything from scratch, in house, including their dough and sauce. I liked the crust. Nice and chewy with a little bit of crispiness and a decent amount of char. The pizzas are cooked in wood-fired ovens which gave the crusts an appetizing, subtly smoky flavor.I was especially looking forward to trying the A La Griglia and Tartufo pizzas, but both let me down. The A La Griglia, which is a veggie pizza, was fine. It was just a little boring and didn't really have me craving more like a good pizza should. I did appreciate the amount and variety of vegetables, however. There were so many veggie toppings, they were falling off, left and right. The veggies were fresh too.The Tartufo sounded delicious and mouth-watering. I love truffles and anchovies, but this one had a way-too-salty and funky taste to it. The sauce just wasn't what I was expecting and, combined with the goat cheese, was not very pleasant. The Tartufo is definitely designed for certain palates and I do not recommend it for most people.Delivery was fast. On a Saturday night, I called and placed my order at 9:32pm. I received a call from the restaurant less than 30 minutes later, at 10:01pm, to let me know the driver was outside. The speed was impressive. We were staying in Milton Park (a.k.a. the McGill Ghetto). Il Focolaio is located in downtown Montreal, less than 10 blocks away, almost a straight shot down Aylmer, so it was somewhat nearby.TPS and TVQ taxes brought our total to $76.46 before tip for the driver. A reasonable price.I'd be willing to give these guys another try.Il Focolaio means fireplace in Italian."
/user_details?userid=FHawvX1EU2cFPWcM3Ppt0g,Rachael K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This restaurant was getting super hyped up my many people for a few years so I knew I need to try it when. I ordered take out and they had free delivery over $25 which was great and the staff who I talked to on the phone were lovely. I was disappointed when the pizza came as it didn't look exactly like a traditional Italian pizza, more like a pizza from dominos. It had so much cheese it was all you could taste. The pizza itself as well was super small. I wouldn't go back for the food but the staff were very friendly and therefore it deserved a solid two."
/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",4 star rating,"Does this place get busy or what?  After a 15 minute wait, four of us were seated on a busy October night.  Tables are tight.  Server brings an English menu as needed.  Lots of pizzas to choose from.  We went with  Renaissance, while the other two chose Pepperoni.  Pizza comes out fast.  They divide it up when you share.  Each of us got two pieces.  Perfect.Not a place for leisurely dining.  But definitely a good place for good quick pizza!"
/user_details?userid=jDeGeFlTTY6C_m9fYVFMdg,Marilyn R.,"Fanwood, NJ",3 star rating,From the outside this place doesn't look like anything out of the ordinary but surprisingly inside it's quite nice! Came here with my boyfriend for some italian food but quickly realized this place was well known for its pizzas. It didn't take long to get seated and the waiters were really kind. Though this place can get a bit busy making it hard to grab your waiters attention to place an order or ask for something. With that being said my boyfriend and I ordered the Margherita Pizza and A La Griglia Pizza with Tomato Sauce. My pizza was alright definitely have had much better margherita pizzas before. The pizza tasted more like a regular cheese pizza than margherita which I was bummed about since it was one of the popular pizzas. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered the A La Griglia Pizza with Tomato Sauce which he also said was good but nothing spectacular. We agreed that we've had better pizzas elsewhere but it was still decent pizzas. If we're ever in the area again though I don't think this would make our list to revisit sadly!

I even forgot to take pictures because it was so great, we did wait about 25 minutes for a takeout.Their pizza  is awesome and takes really fast to make even though their lineups can be really long sometimes.I think that I would definitely return there, maybe I will actually go there now while writing this review just because it is really tasty.I am a fan of Hawaiian pizza, which they have with a blue cheese.Eh. I wish their prices would be a bit cheaper, but I understand that their price-point is reasonable because they use higher quality product to make the pizza from scratch.At last, just thanks for great dinner and increased mood of mine and my family. You are the best in Montreal, or maybe even one of the best in Canada."
/user_details?userid=_-s6uMy7i7TyqRUszrPHDg,Tricia A.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favorite pizza places in Montreal! It is fairly priced and very delicious. It gets pretty packed so sometimes you might have to wait to get a seat but it's not such a bad idea to take a pizza to go and eat it at a park on a Summer day.
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place deserves 7 stars. I thought I was eating pizza my whole life until proven wrong today. Now I've been to plenty restaurants where I had great experiences. However our waiter "" Rashid "" (hope I spelled his name right) was beyond amazing. Very attentive, patient, friendly. He kept his smiling face on the whole evening while multitasking. Never to far when needed. He even appeared out of nowhere and offered to take our picture as we were struggling to take a few. He offered great suggestions, made wise proposition since the menu offered 70+ varieties of pizza. Seafood, meat, vegetable, vegan, gluten-free, you name it. They had them all. The space is an average width but there's a lot of tables so it feels tight and you are very close to other customers. The food was delightful, delicious and well cooked. I had the Marinara pizza, which is a tomato sauce pizza with shrimp, clams, fresh garlic and parsley, mozzarella, onions and I had extra oyster mushrooms. Amazing!My friend had customized pizza with spinach and goat cheese with bacon. Also Amazing! Rashid proposed the house's beer and it was a good choice. Very satisfied. But he took my breath away when he brought us cannoli on the house as desert. You got to understand that I love these little pastries and I'm very picky when it comes to cannoli because I've had a few that weren't fresh. But these ones met expectations. Thank you for the amazing service. I definitely recommend and will go back."

(the other is in Santiago Chile).  We stayed nearby and it was an accidental find, but we enjoyed it so much that we returned one more time before we left Montreal.  The focus is on pizza and they do it very, very well, offering an unbelievable variety of options, and if you can't find just what you want, you are free to suggest your own combination.  Desserts are also very good.  The atmosphere is hectic - crowded - noisy, but the service was fantastic and the cost very reasonable."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A great Napoletana pizza place! Located right in the middle of Downtown Montreal, I was pretty sceptical about this place as I thought it would be tourist-bait. I was so wrong. They actually serve good quality pizzas and have a great variety to choose from.I went there over summertime during a weekday for lunch and we were seated quite easily. The service was good as well. I decided for the Hawaiian Pizza which had pineapple and blue cheese, which was great as well. It was actually difficult to decide on which on to choose because there were so many choices. I will be definitely coming back to try other flavors."
/user_details?userid=8tjx6xsOigLJC07y7yA2BA,JiaYin C.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has amazing variety of pizzas, you'll find one that is to your taste, thats for sure! They put generous portions of garniture in their pizzas and they taste so good. The pizza dough is not too heavy, which I like, but their crust is a bit hard to my taste.My favourite pizza is the Smoked Salmon and it tastes even better with the spicy oil! The only thing that I don't like is that the tables are crammed together,since its a popular place, and there isn't much space so you worry if anyone is going to knock your plate over, especially on their terrace. But the waitors are really nice and friendly. Their service is quite fast too! I would recommend going earlier, especially during summer, because there is a pretty long lineup."
/user_details?userid=65kdUhcdbgCqc0tvfK56Eg,Jessica S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here on a rainy Thursday night because we were craving pizza. It was busy but we were seated quickly.Overall the pizza was good but not amazing. Maybe we just didn't order the right ones (there is a huuuuge selection of like 70+ different types of pizzas). We ordered the Suprema and rapini pizzas. I really liked the rapini pizza - it was topped with rapini, Italian sausage, fresh tomatoes. It could have been better if the sausage was saltier and if it came with a tomato sauce. I liked the suprema - it came topped with smoked meat, tomato sauce, mushrooms, green peppers and beef salami. I didn't love it because the beef salami just didn't taste like much. If it was just a bit more salty and spicy I would have enjoyed it a lot more - in hindsight I should have substituted it for pepperoni.Overall both pizzas were enjoyable, but just missing something from making it amazing."
/user_details?userid=H2AHz9b-d-mhzDv4ETHYmw,Isaac E.,"FL, FL",4 star rating,"Different kinda pizza. With amazing crust... there were lots of selection, but I had the Milanese and it was good. Nevertheless, very unique and reminiscent of the old world style. Didn't blow my mind tho. And the service could have def been better.

/user_details?userid=wmXYo8UbPon5woxlOvVptA,Vanessa H.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",3 star rating,"*3.5 I'm not sure if it was because I got it delivered or because I have super high expectations, but the pizza was okay. It did the job and was tasty. The crust was pretty good. It was super soft and had enough crunch/body to it. To me, the sauce wasn't very flavorful and neither was the pizza overall.Their delivery was free which was an awesome bonus and came at a timely manner. I appreciate that they have a bunch of options and vegan options as well. I haven't tried any other pizza from Montreal, so I can't compare it. I'm just a little picky after growing up eating New York pizza."
/user_details?userid=AQnb4AxKfk-cHM3lNs0Fdg,Asher H.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"Coming from the NJ/NY area its hard for any pizza place to measure up to what I can have back home. II Focolaio, while not quite as good as the very best pizza places in NYC make some delicious pizza pies with an absurd amount of variety on the menu. I wanted to get something a bit different and ordered the pizza with the shrimp on top, and while it tasted a bit unusual upon the first bite, the taste really wore on me, and by the end of the meal I was tempted to order another. Judging by the crowd on a weekday, II Focolaio seems to be one of the most popular places to eat in the downtown area, and justifiably so."

/user_details?userid=0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",4 star rating,"Vegan pizza alert! Although many reviews for Il Focolaio from the past reflect on vegan options, most also mention that your option is to leave off cheese and/or order a tofu pizza. I'm happy to report that vegan cheese is in fact available here and it's sinfully divine (you wanna hate yourself but don't). Don't get me wrong. Tofu pizza is cool and all but when you are surrounded by pie upon glorious pie, Neapolitan style, thin crust ""wet"" pies (sauce *and* cheese), you kinda want... cheese. Have you had vegan cheese these days? Suffering plastic textures and stringy goopy flavorless messes are a distant memory. Il Focolaio's may (?) be made in house because I don't recognize it, unless it's a Canadian commercial brand that isn't available in the states. It's not Daiya (most commonly found in pizzerias these days). It's very similar to Miyoko's fine cashew VeganMozz in fact, super creamy and so good that it feels bad. The Il Carciofi has just the right amount of toppings (my favorite on pizza: mushrooms, artichokes and black olives). I had ordered up the whole grain Omega 3 vegan crust. While it was tasty, I would have much preferred a typical crust made with white flour (I'm a traditionalist). I'm not sure if that crust is vegan, however, as only the gluten free and Omega 3 crust was marked as vegan. Can I mention, too, that our waitress was awesome? I feel like she might have been an owner or connected to the business in some way, because she genuinely was interested in my opinion of the vegan pizza. Blonde, super sweet lady, worked the insanely packed and loud room like a pro. They had run out of wine glasses and she was kind enough to come over to me and promise that my wine was on the way. Typically in packed situations like this, you're going to be ignored, especially seeing as we were at the end of a long row of people.And man, do people love this place (with good reason). It was too hot, crowded and loud as can be (hot because of the open kitchen and beautifully displayed pizza oven, but I'm also not sure the AC was working). A date place, this isn't. Also not sure how larger people would ever be able to navigate to tables along the wall. I note all of this because atmosphere is pretty important to me and I think I'd be more inclined to take out from here (proof of how good the pizza is, as I rarely do takeout). The menu is impressive. So. Many. Varieties. So little stomach capacity. Had my crust been traditional, I would rate the Di Carciofi pizza in my top five vegan pizza experiences, along with Pauly Gee's in Greenpoint and Da Michele in Naples."
/user_details?userid=VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,Israel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3 star rating,"Don't make the mistake we did and rushed to order from the French menu even though we didn't understand it. They have English menus, you just have to ask for them. I ordered the #72 thinking it was spinach from the pictures I saw on yelp but it was broccoli. It was a nice pizza without but not my taste. I took off the sausage but I added pepperoni to it (only like 6 pepperonis) but still not bad. They gave my partner the wrong pizza, he ordered a 73 the supreme and they gave him a truffle pizza that had no meat.. which was pretty gross. They offered to change it when they came back to the table but we were in a rush and had to go. Service was friendly but we didn't really enjoy the food we ordered. They gave us free cannolis at the end which was a nice gesture."

Searching for restaurants with gluten-free options for my girls was difficult. We read the reviews of this place and decided to walk over. Best dining decision we made all trip. The place is unassuming from the outside, with an old awning that reminds me of the $0.99 pizza places in New York. Once inside you really see the charm of the place. The GF pizzas my daughters each ordered were great. Too 5 GF pizzas even in their opinion - and they eat a lot of them. My wife and I shared a salad and a pizza. They were both great and we were very full when we left. Sharing was the way to go. The service was fast and friendly. I commend them for working for efficiently and remaining friendly in a packed and fast-paces restaurant. My only compliant would be the limited beer list. I love stronger beers and the list only had light options. I get this a lot in Montreal so I understand my tastes are different. I don't hold this against them, but I'd love to see more options next time I visit. I highly recommend this place.

We went there for a birthday and left happy and full. But not overall too impressed.The place was super busy, which resulted in a rather long waiting time before ordering, and to get the bill. The server was very cordial and attentive though. We browsed the dizzying menu before settling for the Sotto Mare and Alle Verdure pizzas. The pizzas were quite good! The crust was my favorite part: it was thin and crisp, but retained a great softness/chewyness at the same time. Both the dough and the cheese had great flavor. But the seafood toppings were rather ordinary, and seemed to come from those frozen seafood mixes. We also felt that the vegetables on the Alle Verdure could have been cooked a tiny bit more.A good place :)"

It took me a minute to realize that.Il Focolaio was the 1st place where we had our dinner in Montreal. We shared the Caesar salad and Alle Vongole pizza (i.e. clam pizza). Since it was just the two of us, they were really nice to already split the food portions for us. So one side of the plate had HUGH salad portions and other side was half of the pizza portions. The food was very filling and delicious. Our waiter was very friendly and he checked up on us often.There were so many varieties of pizzas that I wanted to try.

Their menu consists of 77 pizzas, and I thought that was unbelievable. Our two pizzas were 1) Gambaretti (with shrimps) 2) Taratufo (truffle oil, tomatoes and mixed herbs). Both pizzas were super rich with its flavors. The cheese on top was to die for. The best part of these pizza, the taste was really good but it didn't have a heavy feeling.

The menu is huge and literally has every pizza you could possible imagine. There's so many choices, truly a destination if you have a party with many preferences. The prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly and efficient.I decided on the classic margherita and I was satisfied.

/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"I know that this place is overwhelmingly popular and many people are fans of this staple Montréal pizza joint. However, the pizza is mediocre and quite average to be honest. The crust can't really decide whether it wants to be thick or thin so it's at a strange place between. We ordered the Arugula, Carré and the Tartufo. The Arugula one was overly cheesy and the balsamic is overly sweet. The Tartufo (black truffles) was not bad and I did quite enjoy this one.They have an almost overwhelming amount of options. Although, this means that they will pretty much have something for everyone. This also means that they don't really have a specialty and none of their pizzas really stand out in terms of quality. I would have to say though the service is extremely friendly and efficient. I'd say Focolaio is a slight upgrade from your average pizza lunch but I wouldn't give into the hype that this place receives."

We had the arugula pizza and clam/ham/mushroom pizza. Both were really, really good. The restaurant gets really hot inside (btw the oven and packed people) so make sure you can peel layers off. Servers are kind and relatively prompt given how crazy, busy they got and how attentive they still were. They have over 70 kinds of pizzas! Can't wait to go back!!"

/user_details?userid=GGI39_EL1ERSqyWX1tEjMA,Shubhi A.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Best pizzas in Montreal! Too Italian! Freshly hand stretched pizzas with so aromatic, flavourful toppings. They do around 75 pizza and some sides & salads. Crisp and delicious pizza for everyone! they have categorised each of their pizza into 5 categories- tofu(vegan), vegetarian, cheese, seafood and meat. Very easy to choose from. I go with my non-vegetarian partner and friends, we still end up having vegetarian pizzas all the time, I guess their vegetarian pizzas are the best :PThey have a decent selection of wine. We always to a walk-in and although they are full all the time, still we manage to get a seat within 5-10 mins. The seating is very congested, and the place is loud, but I still enjoy it a lot! You feel like Europe! Plus points for Anglophones they speak both French and English, and the service is very Italian - charming and friendly servers! :)The parking can be a tiny bit tricky, but most of the time We find parking with 50 meters of the restaurant."

It's quite a charming place. The waiters are very sweet. They checked on us after we got our food and came to fill our water whenever we were running low. They have such a huge menu! Luckily for me, my boyfriend already came and he recommended the volcano calzone, so I didn't have to waste time figuring out what I want and we just split a volcano. It came quite quickly, but again, it wasn't a busy morning, so I'm not sure what the service is usually like. They even cut it in half for us and brought it over on two plates. I thought that was a very nice touch. Usually, restaurants bring the food on a plate and bring an empty plate to let us split it ourselves. The portion was quite large! I was definitely full after my half of the calzone. The calzone itself tasted quite good! The crust was the best I've ever had. It was thin and crunchy without being hard and destroying your palate. It was just... perfect!! The put spicy oil and pepper flakes on the side so that you can put however much you want. I'm not a huge fan of pizza/calzones, but this is definitely where I want to go if I ever have a craving. I wasn't as mind blown by the food as yummy boyfriend, but that might just be because Im not a big pizza fan to begin with. Overall, friendly and efficient service, good food, nice atmosphere!The only little thing I don't like is that the tables are quite close together. I had my backpack on and I had to take it off in order to navigate my way to the exit. I imagine it must be a little stuffy when it's busy, but I haven't experienced it"

Since I kept mentioning it every 5 seconds, my co-worker reminded me of Il Focolaio, which is nearby to work. Though I visited many years ago, I really didn't recall much of my experience. Anyway, I decided to take the chance after work today. Walked in, took a seat for one, started browsing the menu and quickly realized that there are an overwhelming number of options! The waiter helped me make a decision and we settled on the #32, the Danisi (Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, capicollo, garlic, fresh basil, oregano, Parmigiano-Reggiano + Olive oil. I thoroughly enjoyed my pizza; the tomato sauce was well flavoured + not too acidic, the capicollo added the right amount of saltiness and the tomatoes + herbs added the right amount of freshness.I'm giving 4/5 stars because I found the place very loud. In all fairness to them, it seems like a family restaurant. However, I prefer dining with quieter surroundings."

Wow, what a find!We got a pitcher of blind ale on tap to start with, then went for entrees. Since it has a rep as having the ""best pizza in Montreal"" I thought I'd get a #32 - cheese, tomato, ham, and some other stuff. Thin-crusted, crispy greatness! My partner got a ""Volcano"" calzone which has some meats and a bit of spice to it. He said it was not quite as spicy as he had thought from the description, but it was still delicious anyways. Beer was great, too. Service was fast and friendly. They picked up that we are not French speakers before we had a chance to speak. Our orders cooked up quickly - almost surprisingly so- despite the full house. Tables are set tightly, as you'd find in Europe. Lots of local folks, I think, which is one of the reasons I had good vibes when we walked in. There is a lot of great food in Montreal, and the scene is competitive. We didn't try the veggie options, but they have some. Not vegan, but meat free. We are gonna tell our Indian folks on the team about it.We have a few days here for a conference.

Vibe-wise, this place is always packed, you will have close neighbours. If you want a spot at the terrasse, you'll have to arrive early! Service is quick and attentive, no issues there.The pizza menu is incredibly extensive, maybe a bit too much for those like myself who get anxiety about taking bad food decisions. I had no regrets trying the Danisi and the Spinarto though. The portion size is very reasonable, though a bit expensive for what it is (I'd say 2-3 pizza for a group of 4 unless you're starving), the combinations of ingredients are delicious and the dough is pretty perfect (crunchy, soft, not too thin).On the other hand, the Caesar salad was incredibly basic. Store-bought sauce and croutons, skip unless you're really craving that Renée dressing. The red sangria was nothing to write about, kind of watery.I'd certainly come back to try more pizzas."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was in Italy last month and this pizza was pretty much just as great. The crust is really the most important part, not too thick, not too burnt, not too soggy. I was skeptical when a fork and knife were offered to eat pizza with, and I was the only one in the party that insisted to pick my slices up. Their menu is extremely expansive, where you can end up with TONS of toppings on your pizza. It's great, but the only setback is you might have trouble keeping the toppings on when you pick up the slices. I got la Milanese pizza, and I saw how they put the driest topping (Italian ham) on the bottom, so the crust wouldn't get too wet. There were some previous reviews about too little tomato sauce but you honestly don't need too much! Our party also ordered meatballs, a dessert calzoni, and pitchers of sangria to share. All the food there is reasonably priced in terms of Montréal restaurant standards. The dessert calzone was also amazing, thin dough filled with Nutella and what I think was canolli filling. Definitely share it with at least 5 people! We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed! I think you need to get a reservation whenever you want to go because this place is always filled. The atmosphere was welcoming, but loud and hot. I couldn't hear what the people on the other side of the table were saying. I was sweating a lot at the table near the oven. Anyways, worth going if you like a classic Italian pizza. The pizza gets 5 stars"

We ordered a parisienne pizza (mushroom, basil, cheese) and a four cheese pizza. We also git a house salad to start off. First of all the salad portion was huge, it had everything in it, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, radish, all types of lettuce, and the sauce was excellent, light, refreshing and tasty. If a simple salad can be so good just imagine their pizza. Soon after our pizzas came and boy or boy did it smell good. I dived  right into it and it was so goood. The dough was delicious, crunchy and smell woody, the cheese is so cheeesyy and elastic. The mushroom were really fresh, I truly loved their food.

Too soggy, burnt, too thick, too thin--the crust of the pizza is often overlooked. Not here. Il Focolaio has nailed their crusts.I absolutely love their ""Volcano"" calzone, and it keeps me coming back time and time again. As much as I want to explore their other options, it's VERY DIFFICULT to resist the Volcano. They offer impressive menu of pizzas, so there is surely something for everyone. They have vegetarian options, if that's something you're interested in.The service has always been stellar; the staff is fast and attentive, and has never missed the opportunity to fill our glasses. Pro Tip: If you're looking to get your coffee fix in the form of a delicious, sweet ice cream dessert, you should get their Il Focolaio Dessert. It is Tartufo with a shot of their espresso blend, topped with whipped cream and chocolate powder. TO DIE FOR.My only concern is that some of the tables are very close together, so it might get cramped during busy service. Take this with a dash of chocolate powder, because I've never personally experienced any such problems.Highly recommended!"

If you are quite an indecisive person like me, then expect to take at least 10 minutes to decide what you want to order. I have never seen so many vegetarian options of pizza! At most places you only get the usual Margherita and vegetarian choice but here there was a big variety. I opted for #38 Ratatouille - a vegetarian pizza consisting of green peppers, eggplant, zucchini, spanish onions, garlic etc whilst my husband went for a submarine. The pizza was absolutely gorgeous and divine! An explosion of flavours, the vegetables just right not overdone... The pizza dough stone baked to perfection ahh! The submarine also looked delicious and unique as the pizza dough was used as the bread... Very different! My husband devoured it in a flash and then attacked my pizza!

Wood oven baked Italian pizzas with good combination of ingredients. Great flavours. Noisy and casual ambience which is a positive thing for me but might be annoying to some.I had a Italian Hawaiian pizza (#35) which was blue cheese and pineapple and God was it amazing. Can't remember the last time I had a pizza so good.Also tried the seafood pizza (#20), crust was delicious and so was the topping. Shrimp and calamari was fresh.They have 75 pizza options so choosing the right kind of pizza can make this a good or bad experience. My friends took eggplant one which didn't work out.  I'd suggest sticking to simple ingredients. The only downside was that they had only six olive oil and chilli flakes bottle so we had to share with other tables. Six is too less for a restaurant that can easily host 150 people at the same time. The place was packed so the servers were also rushing us.

The crust was great and crispy. The amount of cheese was just the right amount. The size of puzza was a good 10 inch i would say. Prices are okay as yiu are gonna pay around 15 dollars plus tax n tip.So after my second visit i would totally recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=nLvssaSephFYKHVjMd0XFg,Benjamin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Great pizza spot in Montreal! 5 star pizza minus 1/2 (rounding up due to circumstances) star for logistics of our experience. We arrived just after it had rained, so things were a bit chaotic. The outside staff said no one was being seated there in case of future rain, but people kept being seated there. The inside person running the line didn't seem like she had a good handle on who was next (maybe she did and that was my perception.) One person (maybe just a patron) told us we needed to be in line, which didn't make any sense since we were on the list. We certainly understand the challenge of trying to find indoor spots for people who were seated in the rainy area.We did end up outside and had a very nice experience. The pizza was very fresh - amazing crust, and we took cannolis to go - also very fresh tasting. We had pizzas 40 and 47 - which were pesto and prosciutto. Only wish is that the olives on the pesto were kalamata instead of black. However, both great pizzas. Hopefully our next visit will be sunny and beautiful!"

They have a LOT of variety, I noticed roughly 60 different pizzas to choose from, and each pizza is priced at around $15. You can substitute the ingredients on your pizza for alternatives if you like, some of them without paying extra which is nice.The service was fine, not super courteous but we were all students so maybe that played into it. Our waiter was sometimes slow on filling our water, but the restaurant was quite busy.The atmosphere is great and the restaurant is nicely decorated.Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone craving some pizza with lots of different variety."

The amount of pizza combos is terrific, if a little overwhelming. But with an English menu, the servers were friendly and efficient.Indeed, our pizzas came out super quick! We tried one with prosciuto and another one with zucchini. Both were much more filling than you would think. Two pizzas is probably enough for three people to share as a guide. As you might expect from a pizza cooked quickly, the middles of the pizza were a little sloppy and cheese tends to congregate there in a bit of a goopy mess. The sauce was fine but I did enjoy the crust.Overall, it was a great little stop right near our hotel and all in need for some good pizza.  Not touristy at all. Just don't compare it to the pizza we have back home.  Because it's not as good. :)"

Eclectic crowd from business people to students, young and old but a really chill vibe. I ordered the Danisi which has tomatoes, spicy capicollo, garlic, basil, mozzarella, oregano and parmigiano-reggiano. The crust was light, minimal but very good sauce and great toppings. Ends of the crust were crispy but not too much so. A really, really good pizza. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that the middle of the pizza was a little under-cooked- but not enough of an issue for me to not enjoy this place immensely. I will be back."

The following day when i got on yelp to look for restaurants I was not surprised to see this restaurant at the top of the list.  The meats are perfect.

The patio area was lovely, though quite crowded, with folks enjoying the plentiful sunshine and breeze. We were seated promptly, and the staff was courteous and prompt.The menu is a little intimidating, with 75 different types of pizza to choose from, but there's a code on it that allows you to focus on certains items that may be ""meaty,"" ""have lots of veggies,"" etc. This simplifies what might otherwise be a daunting task.The Quatro Stagioni and Said were ordered, and were very much enjoyed. My one negative comment about the pizza is something I find frequently--the center of the pizza was a little soggy (but I ate the whole thing so apparently it wasn't too bad). I didn't eat any other pizza in Montreal, but I can't imagine it could have been much better."

We opted to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Outdoor real estate is hard to find in any big city and here you get crammed into a sardine-box of outdoor seating. The table is bolted to the floor and there was a pregnant woman sitting behind me so I couldn't exactly ask her to scoot her chair in. The night we were here there was also an epidemic of bees and rather than target one of the floral frocks around us the bee stung my husband.We kept it simple. Italian salad and a sausage, mushroom and green pepper pizza. Kudos to them for spitting both and bringing them on separate plates sparing us the hassle.   The salad was plain, but tasty in its own simple way. The pizza crust was thin, but the toppings a little heavy making it almost necessary to use a fork and knife. Also simple and good.  Service was slow. I like cozy but this was a little too cozy. Especially when people treated it like an international airport bringing all their luggage in tow causing a spectacle as they try to drag their backpacks, huge purses, and shopping bags in and out.People watching was excellent and because we were so close we also had the treat of the audio to go along with it."

I had the Four Cheese pizza which was topped with mozzarella, parmesan, swiss and blue cheese. The blue cheese was a fantastic touch and was just the right amount. However it was too salty near the center of the pizza. Perhaps too much parmesan or something. Other than that, it was pretty tasty pizza!The service was extremely friendly and fast upon request. However there were a few flaws. When I asked for my pizza to go, it was packed for me in a box but no bag. I had to ask for one. When I ordered a Bloody Caesar, my straw was 3/4 the size of the cup so I had to dig my fingers in and look for the straw every time I wanted a sip. Overall, a pretty good first experience.

Finally, after waiting 30 minutes (twice as long as quoted), we asked for our money back, at which time they told us (with attitude) that our two pizzas had just gone into the oven. We finally received our two pizzas, which were disappointing. The pizza base was soggy, there was too much cheese, there wasn't enough sauce, and $15 is too much for a 10-inch Margherita pizza with this kind of service.

The crust is not extremely thin, but yet thin enough for me. There are over 70 types of pizza and all I have tried are really good, fresh salads on the menu too. You can add extra ingredients to your pizza, but I would not recommend it, the pizza masters have balanced the toppings perfectly so the pizza would't become soggy. I did the mistake to add more truffles to the Tartufo pizza, it was still yummy, but the truffle taste became overwhelming. Just stick to the menu and there will be no mistake, the wood fired oven helps to perfect the pizza. The drinks list is kind of standard, but is perfect for the food prepared in the restaurant, classical selection of Italian wines and house wine offered in different sizes, some local beers on tap.The location of the pizza restaurant is golden, perfect for all the crazy shoppers who are hungry after tiring stroll on Saint Catherine street.

This unfortunately was the case with Pizza Focaccia.The restaurant offers dozens (literally) of personal pizza options with almost any combination of toppings you can think of. I went with the standard Margherita pizza. It was, quite average if I'mbeing honest. There was a surprisingly little amount of sauce and the pizza in general seemed to be overcooked as the cheese wasn't runny at all. The taste overall just wasn't great. I also had a salad to start which was just ok.The restaurant itself is clearly popular with locals as it was jam packed for lunch on a weekday. There are lots of tables and they seem to turn over at a fairly decent pace. Definitely was disappointed in this experience. I love pizza, so the reviews suggest that either I just got made a one off bad pizza, or it just isn't as good as everyone has expressed."
/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"The restaurant has over 70 types of pizzas to choose from! Have you ever had that many choices before?The restaurant has enough tables for everyone, with some booths, and a large brick oven at the very back.The size of the pizzas are all one size - roughly a medium size. It is enough for one person (I think). It wasn't too small, since we were both full by the end of our meal.My pizza was GREAT. All the ingredients were fresh, and the dough was so chewy! I'm not a fan of pizza crusts, but I loved finishing them as well. Halfway through, I didn't eat the crusts, solely because I wouldn't have had enough space for the rest of my pizza. I'm not sure if I'll order the same one again next time I'm in Il Focolaio, but that's not because I didn't like the pizza! There are just too many that I want to try. Next up on my list is their arugula pizza.If you're looking for some new styles of pizzas to try, this would be the right place! Having been in the business since 1984, they really know what they're doing! They also deliver, so if you're not in the mood to go out in the cold, give them a call."

We shared the tartufo and the sotto mare. With how busy it was, I was also impressed with how quickly we got our food after ordering. My only complaint would be that the menu was too long and had too many options (70ish). I had difficulty deciding what to order as I wanted half the menu."

The outside area was a little crowded. You can tell they try to fit as many tables and people in their patio as they can but it didn't bother us at all.  They also have an English menu which what was good, since we don't know any French. This restaurant has a huge selection of different pizzas. They also have a huge selection of toppings. It can be a little overwhelming when deciding what to order. It took us a while to decide what we wanted. So we finally decided and we ordered our pizza. We sat and talk for a while and enjoyed the nice weather. The pizza arrived pretty quickly and it was great. The crust was perfect. We had so many toppings on our pizza that we had to eat it with a fork and knife. I would've gave this restaurant 5 stars, but it only gets 4 because the service could have been better. I had to flag the waiter down on numerous occasion just to get more water. With that said, I definitely would go back to this place the next time i'm in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I remember walking past by this place once during lunch time and saw this place jam packed. That obviously stirred up my curiosity and I eventually found out the name of this place through Google Maps (Thank you street view)! I had a hard time deciding where to sit because the view of Phillips Square is actually pretty darn sweet during the time of sunset. I ended up sitting by the window near the patio. I ordered a Pizza Pazza and my friend got a prosciutto pizza of some sort. We had a pretty good time devouring those pizzas. One thing to note was that our waiter was super nice. He came over to warn me that the ink on the menu (printed on newsprint) might smudge off and get onto our clothes (I was wearing white). That was the sweetest thing ever.

Right in the center of Montreal with lots of shopping and touring to do around it. It has a big yellow awning that honestly doesn't look very promising from afar, but once you get closer, it has a lovely interior and atmosphere to eat in, so don't be surprised!"

They have a vast selection but you can narrow down a choice by looking at their categories on the menu placemat. It's a bit crowded in the winter with the large coats hanging off the chairs but I can imagine that it's pretty sweet spot to eat and it's got almost the touristy feel of an Italian ristorante in the summer.

Based on the reviews I went with the Tartufo (number 74): mozzarella, goat cheese, black truffles (mixed with anchovies, olives, garlic, parsley, wine, corn oil), cherry tomatoes (with fresh garlic, oregano, basil and olive oil). This was $14.75 plus tax. They were very pleasant on the phone (even when I attempted to order in French,  he gently asked if I would prefer to order in English...gosh I guess it has been a while since I used my French!). He said it would be ready in 5 to 10 minutes which was surprising but it was only 5pm on a Sunday so perhaps not their busiest time. The pizza itself had a very nice flavour. It is a thin crust pizza and like some thin crusts, I found it just a touch on the oily side in the middle. I was able to eat the whole thing (not the crusts which were slightly black which I know some people like) but depending on your appetite you could split one with 2 people if you had a salad to share too. They are about 10 inch in diameter. All in all a pleasant meal, great location (right off Saint Catherine) and friendly service!"

Wood oven, thin crust, and about 30 different varieties to choose from. You seriously can't go wrong no matter which option you choose at this place. They only have one size (small) so if you go in with half an appetite then you're definitely taking half your pizza home with you. Their version of 'small' is actually pretty big - for me, anyway. Space: Pretty cramped and you'll almost definitely have your neighbors inspecting your order, and in some cases, strike up random conversations with you. If you're feeling antisocial, you might want to go elsewhere. Service: Leaves to be desired. Every time I go, I end up in the same section, with the same waiter who always looks like someone just killed his dog. The staff is not overly friendly and service is very, very slow. You can easily wait 30+ minutes to get your order so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. True, I always go at lunch when it's packed, but in my opinion, they should staff the place accordingly to speed things up. It's a popular place so they know lunch packs it in. They have a small terrace out front but you better get there early if you want to sit outside."

If you like pizza with lots of cheese and generous toppings than you need to come here!  I love prosciutto and there was plenty of it on my pizza! My partner's n. 27 was a little off and we concluded it was because WE made an adjustment. We think we would have liked the pizza as stated on the menu. Having said that, I'd suggest not making tweaks to your order. There are so many options to choose from on the menu! You're bound to find something you like!One thing to note is that the tomato sauce was very scarce and bland tasting on the pizzas. If the presence of tomato sauce on your pizza is important to you than you may be disappointed by the pizza here, but only slightly. There's just so much good going on otherwise. Ultimately, that is why I am giving this place 4 stars, and also because the menu lacks appetizer options.

How could I pretend to say I was happy with them? Because of this pizza I will be leaving my boyfriend to spend every waking hour of my time eating this pizza.  Every day.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  So long as I have this pizza I do not need anything else, in the time it took me to type this I have gained 35 pounds, but it was well worth it."

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the better pizza joints in Montreal. I had lunch here last week and the place was jam-packed. With a menu which has nearly 90 different pizzas, you're bound to find one you like. Plus it's all made in a  wood-burning oven in the back, rendering the crusts, to be super thin, crispy, and yet substantial enough to hold all toppings. Plus the dough doesn't fill you up to much and to quickly preventing you from enjoying your toppings.From what I understand, this is pretty close to Neapolitan standards of pizza (Naples is the real home of pizza in Italy) and pretty much all the toppings are those you'd find in Italy but there were a few toppings which I do wished were offered even if they aren't Italian. I love Mexicana pizza so unfortunately there were no hot peppers or ground beef. I was also surprised that there was no granita or tiramisu for dessert, but that's just being nitpicky.You really cannot go wrong coming here for lunch sometime."

Fresh ingredients, homemade pizzas at inexpensive prices... Who can beat that?!On the other side, their dessert such as their Tiramisu is not as exciting as their pizzas, it's okay.

Place was packed on a Saturday afternoon at 2:30 and for good reason.  Ordered the eggplant, garlic, and olive pie and can't say enough about how tasty it was and how much I like olives on pizza.  My wife had the vegetable pie, packed high with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, garlic, tomatoes, and more.  Exceptionally fresh and delicious.   After a week of eating awesome French meals, breakfast through dinner, I was dying for pizza, and this place lived up to its billing.   Highly recommend."

They offer over 70 combinations of pizzas an offer a number of items made with either dough or salad. The pizza is made in a wood burning oven.This places get very busy at noon and people start showing up at 11:45am. By 12:30pm, its difficult to get a seat. They also have a patio in front during the summer. During lunch they also allow a pizza/salad combination to share for two people.While I still think they need to spend some resources on cleaning up the bathroom it seems that people get in and out quickly and many will never see the bathroom."

We enjoyed all the flavor choices we made."

If you are Italian or if you appreciate Italian food, I suggest you stay away. P.S. the service is so-so (at best). The guy with the beard served me and pushed me away from my table."

The tables are close together, but I didn't really notice - except when it came to admiring other people's' dinners. I ordered a beer and a Ratatouille pizza. I never liked eggplant, but I liked everything else, so what the heck. My daughter ordered a calzone (can't remember which one). Again she didn't like blue cheese, but thought she would give it a try. My pizza was amazing!! Lots of vegetables and slathered in yummy cheese. The crust was fantastic - tasted home made. My daughter's calzone was bigger than her head, and she went silent as she enjoyed her calzone.And? Yes - both my daughter and I both learned to love our food adversaries- eggplant has found a place in my heart, and my daughter will let blue cheese into her diet.Definitely a must.

There was a row of Bixi bikes across the street and a guy hopped on a bike (parked in the row) and started frantically pedaling. Guess he was getting some exercise in because he stayed on it for awhile:)It is a lively place and there was soon a lineup of people waiting for a table outside so it was good that we got there before the rush.Our pizzas soon arrived and they looked very cheesy and smelled amazing. My first bite sealed the deal, mmmm,  delicious!  Thin, crispy crust, very very cheesy with fresh  tomatoes and basil. I had 2 pieces and brought the rest home to enjoy for supper but that was not to be because I devoured them like a piggy, on my drive home!

The pizza size is a little more than what one person can eat in a sitting, so I had some leftover, but for once in my life, declined to take it home.Husband kept things simple with the Peperonata: Sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella. The pepperoni had been placed between the sauce and cheese leaving it soggy and unappetizing.

Perfect crust, just the right amount of crispyness and actual bread. The only thing I wish I would have paid more attention to in the yelp reviews was the size of the pizzas. They are fairly close to a personal size pizza. Between my husband and 2 kids we were fighting over who got the last slices. We definitely could have ordered one more between all of us."

A warm summer's day, the smell of pizza wafting through the square, watching locals and tourists walking by, you could well imagine yourself in Rome. I should mention that I consider this place slightly pricey given the quantity of pizza served. Depending on your budget, you may or may not agree.

/user_details?userid=WWAL_irV6gmHB5KeuBfyUw,Shauna N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,It's the best experience on a hot summer day to sit out on their patio area and have a pitcher of their sangria and relax. Their pizza has so much filling toppings that you have to eat it with a knife and a fork.The only negative thing I can say about this place is it is very very busy. The tables outside are tightly packed so I wouldn't recommend going there after a day of shopping because there's no where to put your bags.

The sheer variety of pizza is stunning, and the crust--thin, crisp, slightly charred--is terrific! I had a pie with spinach, artichokes, and olives that was the winner of the whole table. The ratatouille pizza was also very good, as was the pie with shrimp. Service was prompt and friendly, the location was perfect-- a little bit of a walk from Vieux Montreal, nicely situated for people-watching!"

We were greeted by a friendly server who promptly took our order.  We got two pizzas which were more than enough for two.  One had peppers and onions and the other had sausage, artichokes and peppers.  Both were very delicious.  We walked by this place a few times later on and it was always packed.  I'd describe this place as no-frills decor + excellent pizza  with fresh ingredients."

Finally the sun was out and so we both felt like beeing on a terasse ! Yelp helped us find this authentic classic wood oven thin crust pizza :)!! Beeing 2 we had a table pretty quickly ! The menu is a simple but the choices are no ending !!! I really appreciated the fact that each type of pizza indicated if it was vegetarian, sea food, cheese, tofu, etc ! It made it very easy to filter it down ! After going thru the over 70 type of pizza i realise there was a continuation on the other side ! My wife and I really didnt know what to choose ! But i felt like this restaurants really helps you to discover yourself because you really have to make up you down so you can narrow down your selection of pizza ! Looking at the back side of the menu even tho they are known for their pizza i got convinced that a veggy submarine is what ill eat ! (When i saw the size of the pizza i knew my wife couldnt finish that on her own and that ill still get some pizza even if i ordered a sub :)!!! The waiter was really nice very caring even tho the terasse was pacted at full capacity the service was beyong my expectations ! We got plenty of time between the time we ordered our pizza and we received so really didnt feel pressured or rushed,even if the waiting line was getting longer ! I had no idea what the submarine could look like but OMG ! Thats exactly what i said when i saw it ! The bread was made of pizza dought cooked in the wood oven ! Great cheese and fancy selection of vegetables ! We were also offered some spicy oil and cayenne pepper flake ! The submarine couldve easily been eaten as a sandwich with your hands but it was also very easy to use a fork and knife to cut it down into smaller pieces ! I got to taste my wifes pizza and again i can say the selection of their veggies is of high quality and fresh ! I will definately go back this summer ! + the absence of ketchup prooved to me how much of a legit italian restaurant it is :)!! I recommend allll the way !"

/user_details?userid=1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,Wes N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"what you need to know about the atmosphere, service, and food :O)Atmosphere: Go, with God's Speed, and even with you eyes closed - this place is an institution!  Il Focolaio is always lively, always bustling, and a place were you look around and see people enjoying being there.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill pizzeria ~ this is a place we're you'll feel (even for a little while) that you're somewhere other than where you've come from.  Il Focolaio is usually very very busy at lunch time (it is near the heart of Montreal's business district), as such seating is hard to come by.  Unfortunately, the place (understandably) does not take reservations.  If this is your first time going, make sure to pass by at dinner time or a little later - say 6:30-9:00. Service:  The service at Il Focalaio is always (always) courteous, and quick - but equally down to a point.  SInce the place isn't very big (relatively), and its often at or near capacity, the waiters (mostly young), must do their jobs quickly and efficiently.  They're great at what they do.Food: Go! You will walk out giddy and satiated ... not unlike a successful first date! Be prepared to sit down at Focolaio and spend time agonizing over which of the 75 different kinds of pizza pies you would like (even those who've become regulars - still ponder the choices!).  Cooked on a stone hearth with fresh ingredients that are as diverse are they are plenty, pizzas come to your table pipping hot on a thin crust.  Beer is on tap, and wines are also available.  The menu does contain some other no-pizza choices like salads, pastas, and lasagna - but let's not kid ourselves - the pizza is why you want to be there! Not a place to grab a slice and go - you'll want the whole pie!"
/user_details?userid=AZ6_DdWKH22jauCI6IlnDQ,Ian S.,"Medford, MA",5 star rating,"This place was wonderful!  I decided to check it out while staying in Montreal recently because it had positive reviews and was also right around the corner from my hotel.  Their delicious, thin-crust pizzas are probably about 10 inches in diameter.  Each one is the perfect size for one person.  Service was very friendly and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is lively--it reminded me of a European cafe.  Also, Il Focolaio has the distinction of actually being open for dinner on Sundays, which is slightly uncommon in Montreal.  (Many restaurants close around 4 pm on Sunday.)  So, after wandering around the city for about an hour on a Sunday at 6 pm, not able to find any place to eat, I ended up coming back here for the second night in the row.  Luckily the food is so good that I didn't mind!Be aware that they have a TON of different pizzas--something like 85 different varieties.  (Most of them are just different combinations of the same toppings, but still.)  The first night I had the Romana (tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, basil, oregano, garlic, olive oil), which was great.  The second night I had the Fa Bene (mushrooms, black olives, spinach, mozzarella) which was also good.  I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here, so pick your favorite toppings and enjoy!"

I love the thin crust done in the wood burning stove and this was delicious. A little pricey, and we ended up ordering ""to go"" because it was pretty packed in the small restaurant. The waiter was very nice but he said our food would be 15 min and ended up being more like 25 min. Next time I'd probably phone ahead and pick up later."

The menu is overwhelming but seems any randomly pick is a good one. What I particularly like is that there are pretty distinct differences across the options so if you are a group and ordered a few different options you get to enjoy the variety. The highlights that I remembered: #66 smoked salmon, #20 shrimp, and sangria."
/user_details?userid=rpRydckyNdrnjrP8GufYJw,Carrie W.,"South San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"One star because the guy behind the register/bar is an asshole. I called in my order from my hotel because there was a long line outside. I was surprised when he told me it would take only ten minutes. When I expressed my amazement they could turnover an order that quick, he said 10-15 minutes. So I waited 15 minutes and then took the elevator down from the 9th floor and walked over. I paid and waited and waited. It is hot as blazes in there with the wood brick oven. So I asked someone to check on my order and when they asked the guy behind the counter when my order would be ready, he responded, ""when it's ready."" Asshole. When someone actually went to the kitchen to check, my pizza had ""just gone in."" I don't care how busy you are, but you should at least be apologetic if your timing is off. Three other waitstaff checked on me and offered freebies which I declined. One of them should be behind the counter rather than the guy there now. They at least knew something about customer service. And if that jerk is not the owner, I want the owner to know this happened on Tuesday, August 9th. I placed my order at 8:06pm and received it at 8:36pm which I would have been fine with if I had been told it would take 30 minutes which is what I normally expect.As for the pizza itself, crust is not thin as another Yelper reviewed. It seems like regular crust. Thick and chewy. They got a good char on the edges from the oven, but the center was cold. Cheese not melted, meats were cold. Hot sausage tasted old. Beef salami was interesting, but it might have tasted better if it had actually been cooked through and crisped up a bit. I guess that's what happens when they ""rush"" an order."

/user_details?userid=jhgg-owXiAvREJjyFzyQ5w,Dritan K.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I feel that one of the most important factors in an Italian-style pizza is getting the thin crust absolutely right, and this place doesn't quite do that.  There were certain parts of the pizza where it felt a bit too thick.  The pizza toppings themselves were quite good though and the service was reasonable (we went during crowded lunch hour).   Also, the menu is unnecessarily intimidating, with over 70 pizza choices (and yet, no prosciutto and arugula).  Could have been made simpler with just a few base choices and allowing substitutions."

I really liked the base, sauce, and cheese. The sauce wasn't super acidic or anything and the cheese was generously put on and gooey. Really good. The only thing that irked me was that the capicollo wasn't really spicy (I thought it would be because I think the menu said it was, but to be far I don't have a whole lot of experience with capicollo) and seemed more like regular cooked deli ham. This was a bit of a bummer, but they were generous with the toppings. I'll still go back when I've got a hankering for pizza.  Also, huge menu too. There's something for everyone. They have specialty options for vegetarians and those who are gluten-free and so many flavor combinations.J'ai visité Pizza Il Focolaio parce que mon amie m'a dit que c'est délicieux.

It's hard to say it's the very best because I haven't tried them all, but it is definitely in the top 3.What I like about the pizza they serve is that it's not pretentious. It's not overpriced. It's a good pie with a good amount of food to stuff in your mouth. It's fresh. The dough is not too thick, not too thin and it's not mushy. These are important points some of the ""famous"" pizza joints fail on to some degree. Here you'll get your money's worth and I appreciate it when a restaurant doesn't pretend to be what it's not.Variety is the spice of life and in this case, they brought the whole rack to their menu. If you don't find at least 3 different pizzas I would be surprised. As a vegetarian I found plenty of delicious looking options but I finally settled on La Bomba. Partly because of the name but mostly because of the chilli peppers. (It wasn't spicy enough anyway but you can never forget chilli oil on your pizza!)Service was adequate. The place was jam packed and we never felt like anything was missing or not on time.Ambiance is just like the pie and the front of their restaurant: it is what it is. Simple, honest, friendly, warm. There were lots of families eating with their kids. I like that. At some high-end pizza places I always feel like some of the spirit of grubbing out is lost amongst the sea of jackets, hugo boss shoes and pizzas with 2 little pieces of cheese on it for $20. Not here. Just come with a good appetite and enjoy some really good pizza.Vegetarian food: 4.5 out of 5Service: 4.5 out of 5Value: 4.25 out of 5"
/user_details?userid=P0eFbAn4_YLQ0YPpxDE-JQ,Stacey K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I went for dinner with my boyfriend. We were seated right away but i found it to be very cramped. I ordered the margherita pizza which I found to be lacking in taste. The crust was excellent though. My boyfriend had the meatball pizza which tasted like spaghetti&meatballs which was cool. Overall I would have to go back to try another kind of pizza! If you're a fan of just cheese pizzas perhaps try the 4-cheese.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pizza is a deeply personal thing. While most of us can tell what is a good pizza and what is a bad pizza, it is the differentiation between good pizzas where people argue. Details like the tang of the tomato sauce, the amount of each ingredient present, thin crust vs. thick crust.... all of these lead to many discussions about which pizza is ""best"". Here in Montreal, we are spoiled with many great options. Personally, I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and a certain place in Little Italy right now that I won't mention here to avoid direct comparison through this post. I took my girlfriend there and while she enjoyed it, she told me that she preferred her personal spot. And thus, we had no choice but to go to Il Focolaio right by Phillips Square to see how it would rank for me.Open since 1984, Il Focolaio does thin crust pizza in a maple wood burning oven. The crazy part about their menu is that they have 75 different pizzas! That is an insane number and frankly one that made me a little scared.... when a menu gets that big, I wonder how many can be truly great. I still kept an open mind and plus it was a beautiful night so we sat on the terrasse with a beer ready to enjoy some pizzas.Given we had an friend with us on this Friday night, we tried three pizzas. First up was La Milanese - tomato sauce, artichoke hearts, capicollo, mushrooms, black olives and mozzarella. A nice crispy crust on the underside - the pizza held up to grabbing with one hand. On the flip side, I found the top of the crust to be a little burnt in spots and a little too flaky to my liking. In an ideal world, I want crunch but still chewy once I bit in. All three pizzas were the same so they are consistent with the cooking in the oven. In this instance, I suppose it is more a matter of personal taste. Each pizza is about 12 inches so a solid size as a personal pizza. Plenty of ingredients as well which cover the entirety of the pizza. This particular mix of ingredients wasn't my favourite - I liked the fatty capicollo and the mozzarella but I've never found artichokes and mushrooms very enjoyable on a pizza especially if they are rough cut as they were. I also hate olives - I guess you can tell by now this wasn't my choice - which didn't help.Our second pizza was the Spinarto - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, artichokes, mozzarella and olives. This one - again not my choice... darn olives! - was more enjoyable to me. The garlic and spinach worked well and somehow helped to make the artichokes less noticeable to me.Finally we get to my choice, the Renaissance - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, olives, mozzarella and spicy pancetta... without the olives of course! The extra kick of the pancetta gave this pizza more bite compared to the more vegetarian pizzas we had before. Also the cheese was a little bit more golden on the top than the previous ones which provided a little different flavour and texture. Pretty enjoyable to me.Lastly, while Il Focolaio doesn't have many things on the menu other than pizzas, they do have Sicilian cannolis which I can never say no to! Solid crunchy shell with a nice creamy filling, these were a solid way to finish off the meal.In the end, I enjoyed Il Focolaio but its pizza didn't blow me away. It's definitely the best one in the downtown core I've tried so but left me firmly believing in my own personal favourite at the moment. My girlfriend didn't succeed in swaying me which means that pizza will remain a point of contention between the two of us. Guess we will just have to alternate between spots for a while if we want harmony to remain!Cheers!"

J.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Cannot comment on the ambience, since we ordered in.  It was a Monday night, and apparently many restaurants in the downtown area are closed on Monday's, so we yelped and found this resto who would deliver to the hotel, even though it was about 15 minutes to closing time.  (That was very nice of them!)We ordered the portobello and olive pizzas.  They arrived quickly and piping hot.  They are not stingy with toppings, which is awesome.  Our only complaint (if I can call it a complaint), is that it was too cheesy.  But that was our fault.  We made the mistake of ordering it with extra cheese, thinking that it would be like extra cheese from the chains.  Definitely not!  And to help digest, we did go for a walk in the neighborhood, and happened to stumble on the restaurant itself, and it was crowded even though it was after it was closed.  Always a good sign :)"

/user_details?userid=aVxpgZk6ZwUBKzvCs2Ae4w,Jacqueline N.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I had to check out this place when I heard there were over 80 options! I went with the margherita though because I think it is the best pizza to judge a pizza place on for the first try. The crust was good enough, a little difficult to chew/cut but tasty nonetheless. The cheese was not my favorite and quite greasy. I wish that the basil tasted a bit more fresh but it still hit the spot. (Doesn't all pizza?) I would love to try more flavors to be able to more fairly judge the place. It seemed like a very popular spot. I went around lunch time with a friend and found that it was jam packed with businessmen in suits and felt a little underdressed. I'm not sure if this is how it is always or if it was just the time of day when business people come in. The waiter was friendly and it was a pleasant place with a great location downtown! I hope to be back soon to try more flavors!"
/user_details?userid=OSQWWbxyAzBlxbtTlizZzA,Marquise d.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Update: visited in July 2017. Decided to guarantee better food by advising the server about the two previous poor experiences with pizza that was cold in the middle. Pizza arrived hot all the way through, but crust too well done and very brown compared to my friend's. New gluten-free pizza dough they were trying at the time (July) results in a much smaller personal pizza than the regular dough, to the point where my friend felt bad in comparison to her larger one. Increased my review by one star, and only one because this is still a _tweaking phase_ instead of a well-tested and worthy option for gluten-free. Rather surprising that a restaurant this well-established still hasn't got this right. I could only recommend this place to people who don't need to eat gluten-free. If I ever try it again and it's still this disappointing, it's time to remove stars!-------Original review:If only the pizza had not been cold in the middle on _two_ occasions (visits in September and November 2016) I would give this place 5 stars. As mentioned in every review it has an extensive and delicious menu including gluten- and lactose-free options and relatively friendly service. It's been packed each evening I've been. Sadly, the first time, all three of us had to send our pizzas back because they were cold in the middle. They were also too brown (overdone). Staff apologized and had the pizzas taken back to the kitchen, warmed some more and then brought back to us. Of course you think that for some reason that it's just a bad night. The second time was at the end of November, and 1 of the 2 pizzas was again cold in the middle and had to be sent back... but still... why is this happening at all? What is wrong with either the wood burning oven or the staffing? I am considering whether to try it again, but right now I would not feel comfortable inviting friends. What a shame."

/user_details?userid=8rDv0ODezZcl-sfe0EWXgw,Kate L.,"Baltimore, MD",4 star rating,"THE GOOD: Best pizza in Montreal in my opinion. I go for the brick oven kind... Where you can even taste a little charcoal on the dough! One pizza is perfect for one person with a good appetite. Service is very friendly, which is so important especially when you are so busy. And they also deliver which is a big plus. I also like that you can see the chefs cooking the pizzas. THE BAD: The restaurant space is not impressive. Tables are close together. Little older look. No real ""nice decor"". They have TV's but it plays some DVD loop of scenic landscape. I would go here twice as often if they were airing sports games! Second negative is I think they are overpriced. Definitely not order-every-Friday-night-pizza... But I would if it was more affordable! If you order the salads, ask for dressing on the side. My Caesar is usually pretty loaded with dressing which I don't prefer. Overall - if you're craving delicious fresh pizza, go here!!!!"

The first time I was drawn by the Yelp reviews and the second time I was hoping to have a repeat experience of my first visit. There are no less than 75 pizzas to choose from which could be overwhelming but the legend in the top left corner of their menu make it easy to group and narrow your choices - veg, seafood, meat and tofu pizzas are all labelled. Last time I had the pizza primavera which was excellent and this time I tried the smoked salmon with capers. I loved the primavera pizza that first time and I liked the smoked salmon this time. Needless to say on my third visit I'll have the primavera again. Although the salmon pizza was pretty good, the primavera was an absolute delight. Fresh, large (but not too large) chunks of broccoli, olives, mushrooms on a perfectly thin crust pizza, that's not so thin that you can't hold the pizza in one hand and eat it without folding it over in two. Last time I sat inside, service was incredibly fast and I had a nice Argentinian Malbec that I barely sipped before my pizza arrived. This time I sat on the patio. It was about equally busy as the last time (which is pretty busy) but service was slower. I didn't really mind as it gave me a chance to enjoy my 1/2 pitcher of sangria while people watching in the bustling St Philips Square area. I will be returning  again."

First time I went there was with a group of collegue of 15-20 persons and within 75 minutes, we were all done! Pizza is the most delicious fast food on Planet Earth, I could die eating pizza 2-3 times a day for the rest of my live. Topping definition is infinite and therefore, we can make everything in a pizza and this place is a commitment to prove it! The Calzonne are super great tooC'est ma pizza favorite à Montréal. Cet endroit est superbe pour plusieurs raisons1) C'est qu'ils ont un nombre ridicule de garniture.

I had the worst seat of all: right next to the entrance. The terrace was also quite loud, but not intolerable.  Il Focolaio has a large variety of pizzas. Also, the fuss about this place is the crust, which is oven-cooked. I chose the St-Denis: sausages, capicollo, mushrooms, mozzarella and I replaced the green bell peppers with onions. I don't think I ever got my food in a restaurant so quickly. I think we waited for about 15 minutes and yet the place was full. That was impressive. The pizza was a reasonable size (more or less 12 inches). The crust was really good. When you go, ask for the pepper and the spicy oil. It really adds a little something to your pizza. Otherwise, my pizza tasted a little bland.  The prices are reasonable. They go from $11 to $15. Conclusion: If you want a good pizza that isn't worth $1 per slice, this is a good option.

Friendly service and we got to watch the world cup match to boot. This place will make you forget you're having lots of carbs!

The food is prepared fresh and smells delicious.  I ordered a spinach and artichoke calzone.  Sooooo good, I'm going back tonight."

It might be because it was the lunch rush (at 1:30PM?), but the staff wasn't particularly friendly. My friend also ordered a salad, but had to ask for the bread that was supposed to come with it - and ended up getting cold, pizza crust with sauce instead of the expected garlic bread. Otherwise, food was delicious, and I might come back."

/user_details?userid=PFQ_xze5NL7w2by0ZkGwBw,Betsy R.,"Conroe, TX",1 star rating,"We went to this place to have dinner tonight. We were very excited about it after reading all the reviews. It was a big disappointment. We got there and even though they had several tables of four available, they indicated we had to seat in a table of two right in the middle and no more than an inch away from another table of two that was, of course, occupied. We tried to explain the lady that we wanted to have some privacy. We are visiting Montreal. This is our first trip as s couple. She told us that she can't seat us in a table of four because they needed to save those tables ""just in case a party of four shows"". Honestly, this doesn't make any sense. Really?? Just in case? It might be that we are not from here, but in our country, as a client, I have the right to seat where I want to seat, as long as it is my turn and the table I'm requesting is available. Of course we left without having dinner and will never be back to this place or recommend it to someone. Very rude this lady and never showed she cares about our request or us leaving."

Brigade is better (but still not that great). Perhaps I have picky taste when it comes to pizza, or the pizza in Montreal is very mediocre. But I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. It's overcrowded and not worth the hype."
/user_details?userid=8GY7XeII-de_1QoQ_TVm2Q,Ann R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4 star rating,The three of us went there on a Friday night at 7:00.  It was pretty crowded but we got a seat right away.  The tables are very close together and it is noisy and hot.  We ordered two pizzas and a Caesar salad and it was enough for three gals.  There were flies and at least one bee buzzing around due to the open window.  The bathroom was sketchy but service was good as was the food.  Prices are reasonable.
/user_details?userid=cDJ6YtaTg71kcBiZ7L2Xfw,Ryan C.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,I read many reviews for this place and decided to check it out considering how highly praised it was. The restaurant is pretty small when you take away the patio but we didn't have a problem getting in without a reservation (it was just before 6). I got the margherita pizza and my fiancée got the romano. Both of these pizzas were AMAZING! I will definitely be visiting this place again on my next visit to Montreal!
/user_details?userid=0dnJvmv59_hmS4LkqHezbA,Maria T.,"Thunder Bay, Canada",5 star rating,Great traditional Italian pizzeria. The food was delicious and the service was great. You can eat inside or outside on the patio. The pizzas are the size of one dinner plate so it is a little bit pricey for the size but it is a touristy area.
/user_details?userid=-cv1iRpnLTeynFJ02YH2GQ,Kathy M.,"Port Moody, Canada",1 star rating,"This place used to be A LOT better in 2016.  Not sure if it's under different management now or what but, man has it ever gone downhill.  Went there a couple nights ago and we had to seat ourselves, the table right beside us was clearly much better taken care of.  Within 30 seconds of sitting down they had water.  Within a minute they had their wine.  Keep in mind they seated 5-10 mins AFTER us.  I'm guessing they got better service because, they were dressed nicer -  not sure...  Our server never actually introduced himself.  We had to keep calling other servers over, just to ask for drinks and to place our order!  Ridiculous!  I ordered bread with my salad, which he forgot.  The pizza itself had also gone downhill.  Way too much cheese, as soon as I picked it up it all just fell off.  Extra cheese is great but, it's easy to go overboard and they went way overboard.  Way too gooey.  The bottom of my cousin's pizza was burnt.  Service was horrible.  We weren't even offered dessert, so if the business is reading this not only did you loose a sale of the dessert but, you lost future sales.  We used to tell everyone about this place and bring people here all the time, we used to come here several times while visiting Montreal but, we will never be back."

The crust was great and the pizza was full of vegetable which was delicious but I think it could be a bit more tasty. The atmosphere was fine, nothing very fancy."
/user_details?userid=xB1B-GIJ17eEUUteaEO5ww,Noelle M.,"Millsboro, DE",3 star rating,"The food was fabulous!  Had the margherita pizza and a bit of my husband's that had a mix of veggies and meat. Both were delicious!  Caesar salad was HUGE and also had a great taste with the dressing. Outdoor seating is a perfect touch especially on a beautiful night. Only thing I took two stars away for the service. Our waiter #444 Vito was horrid!  Bad mood, not friendly, didn't clear dishes when finished, and never checked up on us. Sadly all the other waiters looked to be friendly and efficient, wish we had better luck. If you go there, ask to not have Vito or his sour expression!"

We had lots of pizza and this place has amazing pizza (only thing better was in Capri). Excellent food, great service (Rafael was the best server ever)! We will definitely be back!!"
/user_details?userid=9m-NGtlgtrHnV6w7f_Dk0w,James F.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"Good place. Get whole wheat crust & no cheese if you want vegan. They don't have vegan cheese, but tasty anyway. Italian salad was very tasty too.House red wine also good."
/user_details?userid=hQFSGwA8voMJWpp2j7t5bg,Josh L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Great tasting, reasonably priced food ready only minutes after we ordered. When we arrived there was a standing line and the joint was packed so it's apparently no secret how good this place is. We decided we would rather order takeout and eat back at our hotel than wait for a table so we took a look at the menu while waiting in line, ordered at the bar, and were on our way only minutes later. If you like Italian style pizza cooked in a tradition pizza oven give this place a try."
/user_details?userid=oTK_fC6OaMKIxnAPC2E4xw,J L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Had the chicken pesto pizza and it has got to be one of the best in-restaurants I've ever had. The pizza was packed with ingredients. It is a bit pricey for a pizza but since it's so filling, you can probably split it with a friend if you're not trying to keep some for a midnight snack to go with that Netflix movie ;)Oh, and did I mention friendly staff? Tight in spacing and the place is almost always packed."
/user_details?userid=j7QAx9MEmqMolj-SVnrFPw,Nicolas M.,"Montclair, NJ",4 star rating,"I've eaten here twice so far in my time in Montreal. It's definitely a friends and family pizza place where you can order just about any variety or kind of pizza. It's usually quite crowded so that means it must be good. My folks and I usually wind up having long discussions over what toppings to get! It's a nice place for family and the pizza goes down well with a bottle of wine :) The crust is thin, the cheese isn't plastic and it has an authentic flair to it."

/user_details?userid=pFYYCrKbAM5Ryf1-dvFGNw,Meghan B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've passed by here nearly every day for the past two years, but never thought to go because it looks so unassuming from the outside. The other day for my birthday I really wanted to go to a pizzeria, and my boyfriend found this place online. It had great reviews, so we decided to give it a shot. Oh. My. Goodness. Both of us agreed that it is our favourite restaurant in Montreal, and it's right across the street from our place! There's so many different types of pizza, it's amazing. We both loved that they are personal sized, because since I'm vegetarian and he isn't it can be tricky to order one together. The portions were big enough that I boxed up the rest and had it for lunch the next day. The staff were super friendly, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. It's a cozy little space that's a little dated, but I loved it. The food came very quickly, and it was amazing. I asked for extra cheese, but I didn't need to because they put on enough. Best pizza I've had in a long time. Definitely going to be a regular spot for us."

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went in there because of the excellent review status from Yelp. However its very basic pizza quality despite the 75 different pizza options. The middle of the pie was rather mushy. The place has a great ambiance and very family oriented despite being smack dab in the middle of Downtown Montreal.  The service is good, the food good and the restaurant is nice and clean. Just not a mind-blowing pizza experience found at Santa Lucia or Pizza Napolitan. But suitable for a lunch break from work. I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."
/user_details?userid=ZGE7zt2_B5yYaWDKjq2vUw,Jeffica K.,"Columbus, OH",3 star rating,Had a pizza and salad in in 2 separate visits.  The food was good.  Value was fair given it is a tourist area.  Indoor-outdoor seating.  The staff over all was nice but the first time we we were they they would not serve just a beer even though we were going to came back later for dinner.  Said that was the law but not so sure about that.  Still wound up going for dinner and the pizza was pretty good.  Next night got the salad.  It was pretty good also.  I give high marks for fast carry out.

/user_details?userid=tZMsCuDyoiH3mMhIzMgTKQ,Susan N.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"The pizza was delicious but the reason I am highly highly recommending this restaurant is the wait staff.  We went last night with a large group including my two and six year old sons who were impatient and tired after a long day of sightseeing.  The restaurant was very busy with Friday night customers.  A constant stream of pizzas and people seemed to be moving through the large and packed dining room that was buzzing with noise.  My older son was fascinated watching all the activity around the pizza oven and decided to take it upon himself to go to one of the managers and ask if he could work as a waiter since he was ""faster than a cheetah"" and could really help out.  He was so crestfallen when he was told that he was too young that he came back to our table and sobbed.  A short time later the manager came by with a waiter's shirt and gave it to my son telling him that he was welcome to join the team next year when he was a little older.  This wasn't some old tshirt but a brand new high quality polo shirt.  My son was so happy it made his night.  I was really so touched that during their Friday night crush when the restaurant was literally rushing dozens of pizzas out of the oven every few minutes - that the manager would take time out of the swirling craziness around him to make a disappointed little boy feel better.  All of the other waiters were so kind as well.  Really they could have just treated my son with annoyance - a little kid bothering them when they were so busy - but they were so understanding and encouraging when they didn't have to be at all.  The pizza is delicious, I had a vegetarian pizza with a crust that was charred perfectly.  But I am giving this restaurant 5 stars because their staff went above and beyond last night and treated my son with such kindness it really touched me.  Thank you!!"

The place was crowded at lunch time, but I didn't have to wait long for a table for one. I had a hard time choosing. I wish they had 5 specials to chose from. This kind of generic italian pizza menu kills me. I had #23, which was excellent. Nice crust, tasty sauce, just a little spicy. I'm sure they're all good. I think I'll read the menu on line before I go next time. The waiters could have been a bit more attentive, refilled my water glass, offered me condiments. And the place was really loud. Wow. But I'll be back to try some of the other pizzas."

The pizza is always good, and the service is pleasant and fast; the restaurant also has a patio open in the summertime. Montreal isn't renowned for its pizza---you won't find anything here that will rival Lombardi's in NYC, but Il Focolaio's pizza is fresh and the crust comes crisp and nicely charred. The meatball pizza is excellent, as is the pepperoni mushroom (not a combo I usually go for, but it's so good here). They don't overdo it on the toppings, which I like. In addition, their salads are simple, tasty and fresh (and big enough to share). The restaurant also delivers, and the pizza always arrives piping hot (sometimes, the delivery guy is an adorable, charming old man on a scooter. Total bonus)."
