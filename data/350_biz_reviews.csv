The decor is elegant but cozy and the seating is comfortable and well laid out. It was a fun atmosphere , they even had a DJ after 8pm. Service was very good, the staff was attentive and happy to give recommendations, our server knew the menu very well. The specialty house cocktails looked super interesting but were really on the pricey side so we opted for more basic mixers instead (ex.gin&tonic). The food was really good , we ordered a few dishes to share. We had the general Jiao which was delicious crispy on the outside , juicy and tender on the inside with great sauce and spicing, we had the chow fun noodles with beef which was also super tasty and the beef was perfectly seasoned and cooked, we had the beef and chive Gyoza which was very well prepared the filling was so tasty. My favourite was the matcha har Gow filled with lots of fresh shrimp& crabe , the dumplings were very generous in size and in delicious filling. We also had the matcha cheesecake , this was okay. It was creamy and fresh but I found it was lacking  somehow in flavour, didn't really taste like matcha. This was a fun restaurant with tasty food , lovely decor and good service. My four stars is because although the quality is there I find it a bit on the pricey side for a version of dim sum/tapas style portions."
/user_details?userid=qbnFj8gqiq3PqClVbolYXg,Khadeeja I.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,Loved these Asian tapas as well as the overall ambiance of this place. The owner took his time to explain the menu and offer his recommendations. The food is seriously delicious. You cannot go wrong with anything you choose. A ton of thought was put behind all of it and it really shows.

/user_details?userid=7EVsupIaYa9Cmfo4jJoTmA,Emma F.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"So glad to have found this place as we were looking for a post-midnight snack! We ordered fried squid, stir fry vegetables, and chicken wontons. Each dish was Asian fusion with many different flavors and tasted amazing. The fried squid and the sauce reminded me a bit of calamari. The stir-fried vegetables tasted like a higher-class version of what my mom makes at home. My friend said the wontons were the best he had ever had. The bonus was they played great music the entire time!"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Jiao is situated in the Old Port in a remote location. I came here for supper on a Wednesday night as a group of 4. It was a pretty quiet evening so although we reserved, there was still plenty of seating. The ambiance was elegant, with the exposed brick wall, fun graffiti mural, leather seating everywhere and modern lanterns throughout the restaurant. In general, the food is quite like authentic dim sum with a modern twist and I think this was well executed. One of us is vegetarian and the menu easily accommodates their diet. My favourite dishes were the veggie potstickers, chow fun with chili oil and cheung fun; the explosion of flavours were so intense and delicious. The matcha har gow did not disappoint and the matcha surprinsgly worked well with the the shrimp and crab. The siu mai was my least favourite dish since I thought it was too dry and pretty bland. Portions are big enough to share and although it is a bit pricey for dim sum, it's definitely a unique experience. Service was ordinary and our dishes all came at around the same time which I didn't really like since they would get cold. I think we paid around $30 per person without drinks and we were all really full and satisfied. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We've passed by here many times, mostly after having gone to other restaurants. Everytime we'd say ""oh! Let's try it here next time!!"" and we FINALLY did it. I guess mostly because when I think of dumplings I think gluten and Chinatown or South Shore. But u know what? For the sake of food, I sacrificed myself and had SOME gluten I really like the style and decor of the place. We didn't take any cocktails, because adulting.I scoffed at the $100 dumpling but hey, if you've got so much money that you don't know what to do it other than to spend it on a whisky infused dumpling, sure! We ordered the matcha hargow, mushroom Cheung Fun, pork shrimp scallop Siu Mai & garlic miso cream veggies. Everything was very pretty, funkily plated & most of all yummy. I would definitely come back on a post humpday and have cocktails too though"
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Woot woot another cool place in the hood! Had been eagerly waiting for this restaurant/bar to open for the last 4 months and finally the wait is over. It's now officially open! Montreal's first dim sum 'bar'. I am already in love with this chic place. Food: we ordered General Jiao chicken, Veggie popstickers and Chilli oil chow fun (noodles with beef brisket) - must try! We enjoyed all of these dishes. Very flavourful, good texture and right kind of spice level. The General Jiao chicken is a bit sweet (General Tao is usually sweet), but delish. The veggie popstickers, basically fried dumplings, were also super yum. Finally, the Chilli oil chow fun exceeded our expectations exponentially. For sure, going back for this! And, try this drink called Silk Road (the description on the menu may sound a bit weird, but it's worth the try!). I can still taste it. Yum!  Oh and the service was pretty amazing. The owner was their and was super welcoming and so were their staff. They kept checking in on us to make sure we didn't need anything else. Customer service is a huge part of any restaurant/bar experience and these guys know that. Last notes: They are eventually gonna be introducing their late night menu as they are going to be serving food till late (2-3 am). Yes, that's right! Who knew drunk food can actually be this yum and it's dim sum. So excited to be staying close to this cool spot!"
/user_details?userid=Zd3wzNdevk15CwMIJdbjZw,Diana S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Would've been 5/5 stars if I had one of their classic meat items instead of going vegetarian! Came for weekday lunch and it was really quiet, no issues finding seats without a reservation. But at night or on weekends I can totally see how this place could come alive with a maaaasive bar in the middle and a very hip, dimly lit vibe. GREAT for dates - in fact, sit at the bar and let the super nice staff complete your evening! We had the best bar server today - I think his name was Ismael and he was just so happy and excited to help you out :)The food - think fusion. Friend and I went vegetarian today. We ordered the vegetarian Banh Mi with soup and salad (extra $3) and the vegetarian health bowl. Friend and I laughed a bit at the vegetarian options... Basically they used the same ingredient combo in different serving formats. The salad, reminiscent of a Thai papaya salad but also had daikon amongst other ingredients, was nice, but too water-y. If you've had Susur Lee's Singaporean slaw in Toronto, you would draw parallels between that and Jiao's, but unfortunately Lee's had so many more ingredients and textures, and had a crunchiness that was lost here.Overall, most definitely would return if back in the area. Perhaps in the evening though, to try the fancy cocktails and meat dishes!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved everything about this restaurant. The food, presentation, ambiance, decor, and service were all top notch!Jiao is the perfect place to grab a cocktail and light bites with a small group of friends. For two people, I ordered three dishes, which was just enough. If you're very hungry, I'd suggest four dishes between two people. My partner and I ordered the Chicken Wontons w/ Spicy Sauce, the Chilli Chow w/ Beef Brisket, and the General Jiao Crispy Fried Chicken. I wouldn't change anything about the dishes ordered.Also, I have to commend the hostess and waitress for their attentive service. When we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and seated immediately. Both ladies were engaging, personable and made excellent recommendations. I got the impression that they love what they do!"
/user_details?userid=S3KMGLJsbVMTy7-WXiIjjA,Steven O.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"The last thing you want to do is order 3 dumplings for $14 on a late night menu, but when those dumplings taste as good as the matcha har gow at Jiao you don't really give it much thought. Their shrimps are especially juicy and plump, making their fried shrimps just as tasty. The matcha mayo with the fried dumplings felt like more of a gimmick than something that really improved the shrimps, but thankfully they also serve up their dishes with their own mayos and hot sauces. Thought their cocktails were nicely spirit forward but didn't love the balance of the ""Asian Chihuahua"" or ""Marco Polo Negroni."" Overall, I'd highly recommend sampling their small plates while enjoying their beautiful decor."
/user_details?userid=6GgnnAnIvNa5PqV5gbiTvQ,Camille M.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Stopped by JIAO after a long day of travelling. Was expecting it to be a traditional Asian fusion and was surprised to walk into a lounge type vibe with good music playing. The decor and ambiance was unique and of course the food. The food was something I've never seen before, a great twist on dim sum, general tao & noodles. The cocktail I ordered was also delicious!! Will definitely come back with friends to enjoy some food, drinks & good music."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Ok I was super excited to try their food so I went for brunch. The shrimp matcha dumplings definitely lived up to the hype. The jiao chicken was also succulent. The red velvet waffle tasted good but was too hard and dense. The breakfast dumplings were tasteless... basically just scrambled eggs in a dumpling wrapper. The banh mi was bad... the egg was watery and melted processed cheese was the only flavour that came through. The breakfast potatoes were tasty. The prices are actually good considering the quality of the ingredients (seafood and chicken)The service was impeccable and we were asked many times how our meal was. The decorative flowers in the dishes were wilted and brown so that was a bit of a turn off. If they didn't have fresh ones I don't understand why they wouldn't just keep them off the plate.
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A cool spot for dim sum and other Chinese style treats after 5pm. The vibe and decor is decidedly ""cool"" and ""chic"". We started with beer and a glass of rosé for myself. We then ordered a handful of dishes, including the matcha har gao with shrimp and crab, siu mai with scallops, salt and pepper squid, general jiao chicken, and chinatown crispy shrimp. Each one had distinct flavors, textures, and an artistic presentation. They might not have been ground-breaking or life-changing but they were solidly good. I liked the chill atmosphere and can see myself coming back here."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Dim sum bar? Yes! You read that right! This spot in Old Montreal is a cosy bar serving original cocktails, sake, beers, and even a couple of wines. The cocktails were definitely fun and different and I really like their use of Asian flavours, like lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for their mixes. We tried the crispy fried chicken and the salt pepper squid; both were very tasty and tender. We also shared lots of dumplings including the taro root fried dumplings with duck, the veggie potstickers with mushrooms, the steamed soup dumplings with brisket, and the scallop shrimp chestnut dumplings. Every one of their dumpling dishes was savory, well executed and nicely presented; the taro root dumpling was so good, we had to order it again! The service was another big plus for me; from the manager, to the bartender, and our waitress, they were all very attentive and amicable. The only reason I'm giving this spot a 4 is because of the music, as it got uncomfortably loud a little after 8:30 which made it hard to hear ourselves talking although we were seating right next to each other at the bar.."
/user_details?userid=AIzgm0QYUsy1l42hSPfZLg,Thaina E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is such a great place to go for happy hour and cute tapas-like dumplings. This is it! So modern, charming and can I say cool?! Cool! I went for happy hour with my girlfriends, and we were not disappointed at all. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks, service was impeccable, the staff is so lovely and so sweet and the ambience is just very relaxing and cozy. We ordered a few of their dumplings and it was very delicious we ordered them in a way that we could all share and at the end it was so filling that we had to take a walk. It's right of Square Victoria metro, quick 2 steps and you're there. The price is very reasonable for what you are getting and I would highly recommend getting their 'Salt and Pepper Squid' and their 'Brisket and Pho Broth'. Also we went on a Thursday so there was no wait and it wasn't crazy like your typical Friday night. Enjoy!!"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The premise of dim sum bar really got me curious. I consider myself a dim sum connoisseur and I'm always looking for restaurants that try to push the definition of dimsum and reinvent the cuisine. Unfortunately, this was not the place. First of all, my review may be a bit biased because JIAO is more bar focused. We had a reservation at 8:30pm during their official grand opening event and the music was LOUD. Speaking to people across the table was nearly impossible. I didn't try their drinks either, which mean I may have missed out on half the experience. Service: We ordered 4 items, and each item came half an hour after each other. They got the last order wrong, so it was another half hour, aka 1 hour wait between our third and fourth dish. Since it was their grand opening, it's understandable that they haven't handled such a large crowd before, but I feel like they should've done something about it or apologized. The waiters were very kind even though they were having a busy night.About the food:I tried the scallop dumpling (帶子餃), taro pastry (芋角）, shrimp dumpling (蝦餃) and pho soup dumpling (小籠包).For the dumplings, the quality of the ingredients was good, but the dough was not professionally made. It was too doughy and tacky in the mouth, absolutely not what you would expect from dim sum at this price point. They serve dishes at triple the price you would get from your local favourite dim sum joint, with no particular surprises. Plating is elegant and makes for good photos, but quickly you will realize they garnish all their plates with the EXACT same coleslaw mix. With a small menu like their's, I expected them to put more thought into each dish and make sure the flavours are unique and can stand alone. The only dish that impressed me was the pho soup dumplings. The pho flavours were rich and the fish sauce really came through. I've never seen this vietnamese fusion in chinese soup dumplings and they executed this idea quite well. All in all, the food was not worth the price but this place would be successful as a bar so my star rating reflects that. Worth trying if you're looking for a trendy bar spot, but not worth it if you're looking for new high quality dim sum."

/user_details?userid=w-_9fx6NLpshz_JDKOpBgA,Emily L.,"Linden, NJ",5 star rating,"This place is absolutely amazing!!! I first found this place on a Montreal based Instagram account. The first thing that caught my eye was the decor - its really cool inside and the lighting fixtures all around the restaurant are different from anything I've seen. The food - absolutely phenomenal. You can see in the presentation of the food that time was taken to make the dishes both beautiful and delicious. The drinks - very very unique! I had the Silk Road. It was delicious, refreshing, and not like anything I've ever tried before. The service - hands down the best service I've EVER experienced in my entire life. Being the tourists that we were, I needed to charge my phone to be able to get back to the hotel we were staying at and I noticed at the bar that there were outlets. We were seated at a table so I asked if we could be moved to the bar. Unfortunately, we were seated at an exact spot that did not have an outlet. A man working there (I'm assuming was the owner/manager) gave me a portable charging device of his own to charge my phone. But, me being probably the most difficult client he could encounter, my phone was not compatible. He then went on to actually shift a few people down at the bar to get us seated next to an outlet! The effort he took showed just how much he appreciated our visit and I absolutely loved that. On top of that, all the servers and bartenders were wonderful and friendly.Overall, an amazing place! Definitely on my list to revisit when I go back to Montreal!!"

Lack of creativity on the menu with the exception of the brunch menu. Overstuffed peanuts chicken dumplings and spicy noodles lacks flavors and intensity.

Two people in front of me got a table right away, but I kept standing there for a good 10 mins. I asked the DJ if anyone would be attending to me and he told me to keep waiting. The least you can do is give me a menu and let me know if it would be a wait or not while I am clearly visible to you, you tending at the bar, the pony tailed man..especially when you market yourself under the name of a dim sum bar. I instead went next door where I was greeted with a warm smile and a big heart. ABSOLUTELY NOT returning here and not recommending this place to anyone else."

Also, there's tons of hip music playing inside and it gets a little loud, so it's a great place if you're looking to hang out with friends. I ordered the ""silk road"" cocktail which had a surprising peanuty flavor. The food was pretty good, but fairly overpriced. I was most excited for the pho brisket soup dumplings, but all of the soup leaked out of ours and onto the plate, which was pretty disappointing. I recommend getting the crispy shrimp!"
/user_details?userid=cKTdlniUF4-vIyjFsNyecw,Andrew T.,"Austin, TX",1 star rating,"This review is for their service alone as my experience with them did not get far enough to try their food. I was in town for a conference June 2019 and stopped by around 8pm for dinner and drink. There didn't seem to be a host/hostess, so I sat myself at the bar.  The bar was 80% full but the bartender was not actively making any drinks.  She walked past me several times without acknowledging me or asking if I wanted to order anything. After about 10 minutes, she finally came up to me and said the seat I was sitting at was reserved. There were other seats at the bar with a little reserved sign (which is why I did not sit at those seats), but the one I was sitting at and the 3 next to me had no sign. At that point I got up and left. Learn to treat the people that want to support your business and give you their money with some respect and courtesy."
