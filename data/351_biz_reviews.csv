/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Popped in here to see their imported European goods. I found some chocolate dipped gingerbread pretzels from Austria that were so soft and unique. I also found some decorative chocolates for Christmas.Perfect for gifts or something special that you won't find in mainstream stores.
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Oh I loved Le Vieille Europe when I was living in Montreal. Unfortunately, I was a poor and starving student at the time and  so I wasn't able to shop there as much as I wanted to, lol. I would occasionally go there for their imported cookies (oh how I adored Anna's Almond Swedish Thins, lol) and exotic teas. And also for their cheeses and deli meats. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I love the smell of coffee and they have a good selection of coffee beans and a huge coffee grinder.The store has a very European feel to it, and very high prices. However, they carry products that are difficult to find elsewhere. Every time I go back to Montreal I like to pop in and poke around ;) My last visit was shortly before the Pandemic started. Looking forward to going back once this Pandemic is over."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There are some staples that I get here although sometimes they're not guaranteed to have in stock so call in advance!  I love Daelman's Stroopwafels and the store staff told me they usually order them for the holidays.  It's about $6 for a box of 6.  They do have other brands by IMO, the Daelman's in the little hexagonal paper box are the best! The other thing they carry are Rosti shredded potatoes (made in Germany). Naturally, with the large selection of fresh sausages, you have to get a jar of sauerkraut from the fridge section here.   It's a large jar for about $5.  This time around, I found some frozen pierogies in the mini freezer on the back left side of the store.  I love Polish pierogies and decided to give these Polonia Pierogies a try. When I cook them, I'll update the notes here."
/user_details?userid=reipvRp7rg-O2HoKwopcxA,Jennifer P.,"Brighton, Canada",3 star rating,The selection is amazing and they have done so much for the community but shopping here during a pandemic is stressful. Some staff wear their masks on their chin and there is zero physical distancing. I dont think it is worth dying for cheese
/user_details?userid=QrpOADSFNIAkVQa73I8ZhQ,Victoria R.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Great selection of European cheese and more. They have good selection of balsamic vinegar and olives as well as chocolates. Wish more of their cheese was wrapped in vacuum sealed bags since I'm fromChicago and couldn't buy anything that's not vacuum sealed.
/user_details?userid=EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,Kevin K.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Okay.  When it comes to cities with great culinary traditions, somewhere in the back there naturally lies a bunch of places to promote, vend and educate on cuisine.  Take New York for instance - if you want to know what we eat and how we came to eat them, you hit our bunch of ethnic markets and grab some finger foods.  Wanna know how the Greek do their stuff?  Hit Titan or  Parrot Foods.  Syrian?  Sahadi or Souk el Shater.  Chinese?  Flushing.  Korean?  Same.  Jewish style?  Barney Greengrass and Avenue J in Brooklyn.  In short, if you want something and is willing to travel the 5 boroughs and beyond, you'll be able to find it.  When it comes to Montreal?  You hit the Main.  The Main is basically Boulevard St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Jean-Talon, and the diversity of places informs you of its richeness of flavors.  Want Hungarian and Askenazi jewish?  Start at the Sherbrooke end.  Portuguese?  That's around Rue Rachel.  Something more hipster friendly?  That's St. Viateurs.  How about Italian?  That's closer to Marche Jean Talon.  Interspersed between that range is a series of small shops that can cater to your specific needs.  Marguez?  There's a joint near that.  Spanish cooking with a specific need for a paella (the pan for cooking a paella is itself called a paella), there's a place that sells it.  A bit of a melange?  That's what La Vielle Europe is for.  So what makes La Vielle Europe such a good place to visit?  Well, it might have to do with its blend of European charm and core Frenchness.  When cultural anthropologists talk about food traditions they use the term foodways, which is the socioeconomic and cultural practices when it comes to food.  When Quebec was a New French Signoralty hundreds of years ago, its culinary roots were preindustrial French.  Then the Brits came in and injected its traditions, and throughout Montreal's history of expansion through immigration, new palates inform and expand upon these foodways, and there are still cultural and economic links back to France and other parts of Europe, and you see it in vivid display here.First, the cheese.  The glorious cheese.  One thing every visitor to Quebec learn quickly is the richness of the soil at ""nos pays"".  They have great pasture, great dairy, and unlike the morons south of the border, they don't require their cheesemakers to pasteurize all their milk.  As any American can attest, Quebec cheese is just better, creamier and more complex, and there is no better place to buy cheese than here.  Have something in mind?  Point and ask!  They are not stingy with samples and will toss a few clues your way.  The price is fairly decent as well, check out their discount section for some good stuff.  Next, the baked goods.  Yeah, they have bread, but they also have galettes, pasteis and will do you a sandwich.  What kind of sandwich?  They can do something classical like a jambon sandwich, or they can make you one of those gorgeous Portuguese sandwiches with their large eggy rolls.  What about syrups and the beans?  Yeah, for the coffee geeks out there, they have a massive selection of roasts and varietals, and the same goes for the au chocolat.  Sure, they got coffee syrups to add that extra bit of salted caramel to your brew, but the payoff comes to your sodastream machine - The real charm comes from the availability of drinks syrups from France, the Teisseires and the Piquitos.  Trust me, it's much better than the crap on offer in the US, and they last a long time. Honestly, with their large selection of sauces, candies, charcuterie and cooking oils, you cannot help but be impressed by both the breadth and depth of their selections.  Want good eating?  Visit old Europe.  No availability on Air Transat?  Bixi out to La Vielle Europe."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I want to recommend you all the pri pri sandwich which they only offer on street sale event. This year the event is mural festival, 9-19 juin 2016. You will find a long line for it. The sandwich is a grilled chicken thigh marinated with many spices. The sandwich also comes with sour cabbage in it. You can choose sauce such as pri pri, mayo, sweet mustard and Dijon. I really love it. You should try it my foodie friends."
/user_details?userid=9fe41Vmw245Eho1PghHHKw,Amy O.,"Hayward, CA",5 star rating,I'm obsessed. If I had found this spot when I first arrived into town and was buying goodies for the apartment I stayed in - a lot of $$ would have been spent.I wanted everything. So many condiments. Everything unique. Great housewares as well. Gourmet. European. The best. A must stop for anyone that likes to experiment with food. LOVED!
/user_details?userid=Dx1aQ9yOMGEvyMqjdLw-rw,Anita G.,"Charlottesville, VA",5 star rating,"These guys helped us pull together a fantastic picnic.  Lots of beautiful cheeses from around the world.  We had a Spanish, Portuguese, and Danish cheese.  They also had a beautiful selection of meats...we made a wonderful charcuterie board based on their recommendations.  They were patient with our limited French and listened to our likes and dislikes.  We will definitely be back!"

Hobnobs and chocolate digestives, the perfect choccy biccys to have with a cuppa!!! Finally I do not need to fill up my suitcase with them every time I visit the UK. :)They also have a variety of other great delicacies from across Europe so definitely worth checking out!"
/user_details?userid=W6Sj8rpT3GVTTbvBTEHT1A,Judah B.,"Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Young G here. Absolutely 5/5 here. 4.5/5 is under rated. 4:44 is early 2. .I've been in the grocery store several times now but what makes this grocery store stand out is it's lovely assortment of rare and unique oils as well as gourmet chocolate bars and some of the best cheese from Ontario and Quebec. I only have 2 problem. 1) they don't have Lancaster Gouda 2) i was trying their samples. They had two oils and one balsamic. I had 5 samples, one of each and two with a combo of balsamic and both of the two oilsxThey owner came out to discuss the samples which I was excited for until he began to degrade and belittle me that the samples weren't an all you can eat buffet. I told him I only had a few to sample the flavours (as one oil was creamy and one was bitter) he said it again so I told him he had three samples what else would you expect. He then accused me of eating the olives at the olive bar which I was looking at (but did not eat) but decide to maybe get some plain olives and heck out the oils to make a nice salad. I accused me 5/5 times of eating the olives and the bread so I asked him if he could smell olives on my breath at this point the owner grabbed me by the trait cutting off oxygen to my brain and forced me back 5ft into the nearest shelf (not to be mistaken with the nearest exit) before asking me to leave. He then held up his fist which is when I tried to protect my face, neck, chest, stomach and genitals with my elbows until I discovered in horrific crying ""oh's"" that I could not protect this much of my body with my elbows and leg.This grocery is absolutely 5/0 for police brutality."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A wonderful shop which specializes in hard-to-find products, European specialties, cheeses, cold-cuts, cured meats, sauces, coffees, teas and biscuits at very reasonable prices.If you're craving proper British teas like ""Taylors of Harrogate"", German chocolates like ""Ritter Sport""or ""Milka"" along with stand-by marinade sauces from Stonewall Kitchen, then show up here.  I'm always on the lookout for products I grew to love while living overseas but I find many of the specialty-food shops which specialize in European foodstuffs charge an ungodly amount when I thought the whole point to free-trade and liberalization laws was supposed to make this stuff cheaper, right? I guess not but I digress...After comparing with other shops, La Vieille Europe has the best prices going. True, some of the items still remain insanely expensive but how many times are you going to go out of your way to buy marinated black truffles? On the other hand some of the German mustards which go beautifully with the fresh sausages on sale won't break the bank anytime soon.Overall, a wonderful spot to pick up or try out new food items...and minus the tourists of Atwater and Jean Talon markets."
/user_details?userid=h5cSSpNIx3_ITaaY7u_WAA,Anh Thu V.,"Santa Ana, CA",4 star rating,"I was visiting Montreal when I stumbled upon this little shop! The food they sell here is fresh, especially the cheese! We found the ingredients we needed for Italian pasta easily and they also have a variety of coffee beans. This was my first experience at an European market and I enjoyed it!"
/user_details?userid=F8ctt9HK2uCt8UBbUSHFRg,Jenna L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"If you are visiting from somewhere else (Vancouver, like me) and you are always mad about outrageous cheese price wherever you live, you have come to a cheese heaven that is affordable. I am not sure why cheese is cheaper in Montreal and at this particular store but I love checking out so many different types of local cheese and also dry sausage selections. They have tons of goodies here you can gawk at for hours and I can always find something here to take back home as a gift."
/user_details?userid=A7KaGGuusk7mlC7gr6Ljdw,K. T.,"Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,"One of best places to get coffee I've ever been. One of the best places to get cheese I've ever been. One of the best places to get dessert I've ever been. Sensing a pattern? La Vieille Europe is a treasure; it is chock full of amazing and hard-to-find treats and you will have a hard time finding a better cup of joe (which is saying a lot for St-Laurent). I love this place, I miss this place, and I hope you'll try it out so you can love it, too."
/user_details?userid=kuksFR1R8gCUvvhcSWMpjw,Mark H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,German items are hard to come by in MTL but there's a few welcome sights for sad German eyes here amongst the largely French / Italian shelves. A nice spot that smells great due to the roasting coffee beans and friendly staff.
/user_details?userid=xQC-G-9bxyXEsy-GQ-UTEw,Stephen R.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"La Vieille Europe has a fine and fairly wide selection of European import goods..The highlight of the store - for me, at least - is their incredible cheese selection. The refrigerated shelves at the front of the store contain cheeses on special. Always check there first since there are always a number of things you can pick up to suit to your needs on sale.There is also an array of prepackaged foods, though some can be understandably pricey since they are imported. Occasionally, certain items while be marked on sale - so check frequently to get cookies, candies, and other boxed goods for as much as half price. In the ""chocolate section"" near the register, they sell Callebaut chocolate for very reasonable prices.I'm sure I'd like this place more if I had an unlimited budget to spend on food. I have purchased some of the items they sell here in Europe for obviously much lower prices. I understand that they mark up due to import tariffs and the convenience of having hard to find items in one place, but wish some of the prices were slightly lower, knowing what the items cost otherwise."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"A really delicious option for meats and cheeses in the Plateau area, this is an old classic of the Main that really shines when it's meat-on-the-street street fest time. But all year round, if you are working or just walking through the area, you can count on La Vieille Europe for a super tasty and fresh sandwich and pastry to go from the counter. This is a chill family run spot so don't bring your stress in, just come and enjoy the savoury and sweet  tastes of the old country."

/user_details?userid=WN3RFolQCiVAvcqIpWhoNw,Jesse L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Long time Plateau resident. This is one of my favourite destinations. I go here for my coffee- either made by them or i get ground beans from their vast coffee bean selection. Otherwise they have excellent sandwiches, cold meat selection, chocolate, condiments and water from Europe-- ALL at reasonable prices! Have their croissant with ham and swiss along with a cappuccino for breakfast and you will instamtly regret ever deciding on Mcdo or Timmies."
/user_details?userid=js2Jy7YMFNCyhJhGoV4Rcg,Scott M.,"Oswego, IL",4 star rating,"Oh dear-how to put this? It's a Foodie's dream. Not a Resto, but a Gourmet shoppe. The Cheese selection alone is enough to make one pass out. The Charcuterie, the same. There might be a  place somewhat like this in Chicago, but I'll bet not. Everywhere I looked, there was something I wanted, but couldn't buy, 'cos it wouldn't fly on the plane. In the end I bought an Opinel knife (remembering to put it in my luggage, 'cos I would have cried like a baby if I would have spaced, put it in my briefcase and had to surrender it to the TSA.)It's a shoppe, but they make sandwiches there from the good stuff in the display cases. I ordered a Jamon et Brie on an exemplary baguette. Paired with a San Pellegrino Chinotto. Both were sublime. I and pal Beno took a seat on the chairs perched outside, and had a delightful repast with the Floor show provided by the denizens of Boul Saint-Laurent: Pretty Girls, Pretty Boys, Weirdos, Hipsters and Aliens. Oh-so-sophisticated and if I lived in Montreal, I'd be at this place every few days."
/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place smells like God's feet.  And I broke a vegetarian once, just by walking her through the door.  But their condiment, spice, and packaged goods selection is why they're my first stop whenever I'm looking for some esoteric old school European ingredient or food product that I've just read about in a book.  You want capers cured in salt made from the eyelid sweat of skinny little French ballerinas?  Over there, right next to the kippered squid teats from the Bernese oberland.Bring a packsack."
/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Awesome cheese selection, and a great place to go check out some interesting mustard or olive oil.

And COFFEE!They roast all the coffee in the store - hummm actually I need to find out if  but I saw someone roasting coffee in the store.....This is my first review after I arrived in Montreal.  I found Yelp is not popular as in the Bay area so I decided to put some reviews as soon as possible.  I fell in love with this place at the first time.  so that tells a lot :) Yeah! Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=8h1r7mXd-H225yDgc4EMPg,Sarah A.,"Pawtucket, RI",4 star rating,Stopped in here again recently to buy some delicious Quebec cheese. They have a great selection of cheeses from Quebec including some interesting unpastuerized chevres. They also have an excellent selection of jams and chocolates. Highly recommended.
/user_details?userid=VlitfSicdczeiCVx5B2r-Q,Jonny R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Coffee in Then MainI stopped drinking coffee about 15 years ago, and to be honest I don't even remember why I took that decision in the first place.   It wasn't until recently, after landing an overnight job and needing  extra help to stay awake, that I started to drink it again.But now, that I got the coffee bug in me, I only wanna drink a good ""Cafe au lait"", intense in the grain flavor, very hot milk, and a nice layer of foam to top it off!So I've been in a quest to find a place, THE PLACE. This quest has taken me from the most known coffee franchise in the world to the local ones, also to small trendy coffee shops and even to that infamous one that requires a membership.All of them have their signature and followers, but I never got what I wanted, until recently!  This European Deli offers all sorts of decadent delicatessens, great cheese selection and awesome panettones,  but its best feature is the coffee, at least in my humble opinion. The staff is friendly, helpful and well informed about the worldwide coffee variety that you can buy there to brew at home. They even sale stove-top expresso makers!Now let's get back in track, this boys and girls are well thought on how to make a latte to perfection! The coffee used is The Royal, (and yes you can also buy it there to brew it at home too) every single shot is individually grinded, freshness like that I haven't found nowhere else, the milk is warmed up to your suggestion and the foam comes always like a cloud from heaven, a perfect cafe au lait! Or you can get yourself a capuchino and even an expresso to drink while shopping in the spot, you can seat outside or just to enjoy it as you window-shop The Main. Taxes are unclouded in the round price, no need for you to worry about counting pennies and dimes. So you know, if you find yourself in the Plateau there is one spot for great coffee, La Vieille Europe.Enjoy!"
