Just MASSIVE!Ordered the SEAFOOD RISOTTO (highly recommend it), and cried tears of joy...was the best risotto ever hands down. THE BEST! The shrimp were plump and juicy, the mussels were steamed just right, and each grain of rice were cooked to perfection. Since we ordered the combo, it came with a soup or salad, the main, couple of desserts to choose from, and a choice of hot beverage.We packed our main and dessert to go. Had to forgo the beverage.Total came to ~$45 after tax for 2!!! We felt that it deserved 20% in tip.Sad we have not found a place in Toronto which offers the same quality and reasonable price. Maybe someday.Montréal; you win!"

This place has a nice sunny terrace during summer and there is enough space inside for colder months of winter. Their brunch is awesome and very budget friendly. I love their Eggs Benedicts! It can get busy even on weekdays sometimes, but a little wait will be worth it. Definitely a great place to add to the list of local brunch places."
/user_details?userid=tgb-mmxGynwZ_Nec7StKTw,Emily M.,"Strathroy, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered the house soup (tomato base with chickpeas and lentils), muscles and calamari to start. All was good - but not great. We also waited a while for service. However, I understand it was a busy night with limited staff. As the prices were reasonable and the ambiance was great, I would try it if you are looking to spend a moderate amount on food. The next day I went back for bunch and it was awesome! I raised the star rating from three to four because of the fresh fruit and plenty of great options made for a much better experience! Go for breakfast/bunch over dinner."

Very good service delivered by pretty and friendly waitresses They have an ever changing dryly menu at very reasonable prices (soup, main dish, dessert and coffee starting at $16:00 !). I had an excellent mustard sauce veal kidney with vegetables and baked potatoes and my girlfriend a crunchy fish and chips (seethe daily menu we had in the pictures)Really nice place for a good bkfst or meal."
/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"A friendly neighborhood restaurant that's open all hours of day. What are probably the best things here is that they have such a diversity of offerings, reasonable prices, and very generous portions. Brunch, for example, was quite a decent, filling experience. It won't be the best food ever, but if you live nearby and want a dependable go-to for decent, down-home fare almost all day long, this place does the trick."
/user_details?userid=hV7RsFEacHd3fFqY2X70eQ,Meenah T.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Awesome breakfast place!! Huge servings, we ordered the salmon Benedict and an order of scrambled eggs, all awesome. Running tea/coffee. The servers are lovely. The only thing - we couldn't have the omlettes because they all had shallots sauteed in wine, which was an issue for us. Couldn't have anything with lobster for the same reason. Maybe add a non-wine option? Over all, great experience and can't wait to go again!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Tasty and very filling - but compared to other brunch places I've tried in the Plateau, not what I'd call remarkable. However, the prices are decent enough and the options are plenty (maybe too plenty). The amount of food on each plate is definitely too much for one person - I prefer a more well thought out presentation with enough food but not over doing it. My plate had what seemed like a whole can of mushrooms, and each plates comes with ALL of the meat choices (bacon, ham and sausage), not just your choice of one. Overall, with the fruit bowl (some fresh fruits and some not so fresh), the mountain of fried potatoes, the baguette and your actual meal choice, it ends up being a lot of food wasted because an average human just can't pack that much food in their belly. The feel of the place is kind of like a former 70s hotel bar and restaurant, nestled under an apartment complex on the corner facing Parc la Fontaine. It's easy to miss, especially if you're a cyclist and focused on the bike lane and getting through that large, busy intersection. The service was fine, our dishes arrived in front of us very quickly, and there was plenty of seating despite the restaurant being very full. It doesn't make my list of Brunch Best Bets but no regrets."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A friend recommended this place so we decided to try it out a few weeks ago. The food is good and coffee is okay. Portions are huge and the price for the brunch is under $15. Also they serve brunch until 5 pm everyday. The eggs come with a side of fruit and potatoes. They also have a nice patio outside, perfect for summers. However, the service is so slow and forgetful it almost ruins the experience. We weren't the only ones noticing the lack of attention from the servers. The people sitting on the table next to us were frustrated as well and mentioned that this place is known for their slow service. It's almost sad that a place that has everything working in their favour, don't hire more help. Will not be visiting again anytime soon."

Our group of 6 tried crepes, eggs Benedict, and omelettes. The brunch selections came with a large amount of food. Everything was fresh and so good. The staff here was very accommodating of the 2 children in our party and also that we don't speak French. We would definitely return."

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Recently discovered this hidden gem on Cherrier street across the street from Lafontaine Park and absolutely loved the food service and cozy ambiance. This tucked away resto offers a stunnung view of Lafontaine park. The resto itself is large enough to hold groups of 10-12 people. It has has quite a few booths that sit 4 to 6 people. Service is super friendly and this resto actually takes reservations for breakfast so no line-ups!  The food was absolutely delicious!  One of the best breakfast places I have been too. I had the quebecois omellette which comes with potatoes and a delicious big fruit bowl. The other classic breakfast dishes such as eggs Benedict and eggs, bacon and pancakes were also a hit with friends . The fruit bowl was pretty impressive as it contained a wide variety of fruits from yellow cantaloupe, watermelon, cherries to a slice of passion fruit!  The prices are so reasonable not expensice at all for the great quality of food and portion!  Will definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=bcalCCwEIM3FVhx7amRawQ,Nesrine O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When you live in the neighbourhood you have no choice to try this place. I tried it for their brunch that they serve everyday until 5pm. The portions are massive. Even if you take the smallest option, they offer you a bowl of fruits, potatoes, baguette. And it's really cheap. You pay between 6 to 14$ for the brunch. The place is cute, intimate, they also have a terrace. The place if often packed during the week for lunch (service could get really slow). They serve pasta, pizza, sandwiches, salads and the portions are really generous. I've tried the lobster linguini and it was better than i expected for the price i paid. Service is always nice, they often forget some little stuff (bred, water...) as they are a lot to serve you at the same time. But you ask and they are reactive. A good spot for food at anytime !!"

The price is good for the portion and taste, and the restaurant is quite busy, so please reserve or you will need some luck to find a place at peak hours!I tried their seafood pasta and it was HEAVENLY, their mozzarella sticks are also amazing! Brunch is not as good as supper but their mushroom and beef dish was really really impressive! Sum all, a big thump up for Tôt ou Tard!"

/user_details?userid=xLRv4CPZ7Ox-PhJDfQiY2Q,Felice Y.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I was very pleased by this place. They only had the French menu online when we looked, but they have an English menu in the restaurant. We came for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday night. It wasn't crowded at all and we were seated right away. The menu was big and they have a wide selection. I got the penne romanoff without cheese and a glass of Listel-Gris. Both were amazing. It was about $19 CAD with tips. We did have the ask for the drinks menu as it wasn't given to us.The restaurant is about a 5 minute walk from Station Sherbrooke and about a 10 minute walk from Station Beaudry. The entrance was a little hard to find, as it seems to be part of a building.It's definitely a great place to go for dinner. They also offer breakfast and brunch."
/user_details?userid=1G60jrILPeXz1eKwUZrn3w,Emma A.,"Denton, TX",5 star rating,"This place was so perfect! It was less than a 10 minutes walk from our hotel, and right next to the park. We actually ended up going here twice on our trip because it was pretty great and so convenient after a day of walking. We got the veal, ravioli, seafood pasta, and another pasta with spinach and Alfredo I think. All of it was great, but the veal ravioli in Brie and mushroom sauce was the best we tried. I don't know if it's a cultural thing for Montreal, but the service was very slow. Noticeably slow. Maybe I'm just a silly American who wants to eat and leave, but there was a lot of downtime during our meals."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bistro Tôt ou Tard is the perfect place to go to if you want to brunch on a budget. Located on the corner of Cherrier and Amherst, it is nice and cozy and has quite nice views of the park right next to it. The warm and inviting environment combined with the cool morning air and sunlight shining through the windows provided a relaxed feel, and the amount of food given for the price was amazing.I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and for $12.50 it came with a sausage, two slices of bacon, a large amount of homestyle potatoes, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The sausage and bacon were perfectly greasy and carried a savory flavor that satisfied my breakfast meat craving. The Eggs Benedict, interestingly enough, had a base of Montréal bagels rather than your typical English muffin. While I didn't really care for the change, probably because I think that Montréal bagels are too stale and sweet (?) for my taste (go New York bagels!), everything else about them were super tasty with perfectly runny egg yolks. The potatoes didn't taste overly fried and salty like I normally find with breakfast potatoes, so that was a huge plus for me. Finally, the fruit was a sweet and refreshing way to end a meal that left me almost in a food coma and unable to walk home. Whether you interpret that as a good or bad thing is completely up to you, but the price I paid (both literally and figuratively) for eating that much was all worth it in the end."

They have a huge menu and great deals on drinks. The shrimp fettuccine, bavette, trout, salmon and the chicken fettuccine are excellent. There is a table d'hote option that includes soup and dessert with your choice of coffee or tea. I have also been there for brunch and I got the crepe with chocolate, strawberries and bananas. It comes with 2-3 crepes filled with chocolate and is topped off with strawberries and bananas. It also comes with two eggs cooked to your liking, toast and a side of fruit and you have the choice of a glass of orange juice, coffee or tea. All for $9.50! The prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly."

We went for late brunch and the portions were really big, bigger than any fancy restaurant dinners. Also the taste was amazing, better than most expensive and bigger restaurants.

Highly recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=B2Kti0G43t0wkkTLlLJvVQ,Yulin L.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"It was the biggest portion with the best quality, at a great price. I ordered the garden omelet and it comes with a handful of potatoes, two toasts, and a LARGE bowl with all sorts of fresh fruits! I also wanted to try the french toast, and the waitress kindly reminded me that it was going to be a large dish too (which comes with potatoes, sausage and bacon, etc), and she suggested that I get a side of french toast. They were more than delicious. Really soft, creamy and eggary (yeah I just made this word up...). Really worth the price. $8.95--the omelet plate."

This was our second choice but with overwhelming good reviews we were excited about eating here and walked about a mile to get here. Upon arrival we waited about 15 to be seated, which was expected. Once we were seated, we didn't see anyone for about 25 minutes, no coffee or acknowledgement, but somehow the women sat after us had their coffee in minutes. Upon asking for service a waitress came out and took our order. Food came out 30 minutes later, cold. Had to ask for the check and didn't see her for another 20 minutes. So we walked in to pay and she continued barking at us even though we clearly couldn't understand the quick French. Good food, shit service.... If you're American."

The portions are very large for their price and the first couple of times the food was fairly good. However after the first time I arrived, each time I came, the service deteriorated further, and the very last time I went I realized that the food was rubbery and bland. There are almost always flies buzzing around, and they were clearly understaffed, but they weren't very busy at all. The waitress was fairly rude and unattentive, and she was mocking us behind our backs, shaking her head at the other waitresses as she walked away from our table and muttering stuff like ""are you serious?"" under her breath... I would not go back again."

I'm not talking crappy honeydew/canteloupe melon fruit, I'm saying an actual array of bananas, apples, cherries, berries, pineapple, etc... fruit!For two visiting Americans with rusty French skills, they were great, it was nice to see the wide age range of patrons, from families to young couples.

One evening I tried an unusual cut of steak - beautifully prepared as medium rare with a lovely mushroom sauce.  My wife tried the veal liver which was terrifically fresh and tender without any gaminess. Our dining companions both had (and raved over) one of the ravioli specials.  Another night we tried the mussels - absolutely perfect and a steal at the price!  Oh and the fries were way, way too good.  I'll have to work out a lot to get past those.Finally, we had a quick lunch on the way to the airport - hamburger gourmand.  Again, a winner."

/user_details?userid=2ekdlwUVun79-GdN3iUvSw,Cheryl L.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"I am obsessed with this little bistro! My family and I are currently on vacation in Montréal, and we were looking for a place to eat French food for dinner tonight, so we decided to try Bistro Tôt ou Tard because of the pretty high ratings and the variety of the menu and because French food is one of my absolute favorites. When we first walked in, the place looked a little empty and slow (this is because it's more popular in the mornings for their brunch), but we were greeted ""Bonsoir!"" by a nice waitress who showed us to a booth. My family and I ordered a veal with linguini dish, a steak with rice & vegetables dish, a grilled trout with rice & vegetables dish, and a penne pasta dish with mushrooms and shallots. Two of these dishes were on the specials menu at just $3 or $4 more, so they each came with soup (we got a creamy vegetable soup and a tomato chickpea soup with cilantro), a dessert, and either coffee or tea. The food was SO GOOD, I didn't want to stop eating! Also, the portions were plentiful and the presentation of the meals was so pretty! For dessert, we had a créme brûlée and a chocolate mousse cake, which were both delicious and both small and light enough to eat after our meals.The waitresses here were so kind and helpful (thank goodness they knew English), especially since everything on the menu was in French and we were barely getting by with my beginner level French. Service was good, prices weren't too high, and I've decided we have to come back again before leaving Montréal because this place makes me happy and makes me feel like I'm in France! Je t'aime, Bistro Tôt ou Tard!"
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This one is a good bet. Has a large menu, with a lot of pasta dishes, meat and sandwiches/burgers. They have a 2/$22 dinner option which I believe varies depending on the day. When we went, they were offering items such as salade nicoise, beef milanaise, fried calamari, and a few other main courses. This deal also gets you and your +1 each a soup I believe. I decided to go with their other special menu, one of the table d'hôte specials, $20 for bavette, comes with your choice of soup, dessert and coffee. I chose the chickpea, coriander noodle tomato soup, which tasted pretty similar to Moroccan harira soup. It was tasty, and the crispy little wedges of olive oil coated bread they brought along with it were great. The bavette was a really large piece, grilled to my liking, and came with caramelized onions. I picked fries as my side,and they were nice and crunchy and salty, perfect for dipping in their house mayo. Dessert was a choice between chocolate cake or tiramisu. They each were solid, not overly sweet, although not the part of the meal that will make me come back. I'll go again for the bavette and yummy fries, as well as the wine deals. $11 for half a litre of house wine made me happy! Service was very nice and friendly, and the location of the resto with its large windows would make a fun place on a snowy day or sunny one!"
/user_details?userid=lsSzieGFg6Fiun0DmrDThQ,Ken W.,"New Haven, CT",3 star rating,"The restaurant was advertised in a tourist brochure, so I headed over on a Sunday morning.  With floor to ceiling windows on two sides, diners get expansive views of Parc La Fontaine diagonally across the street, and cyclists streaming by.  Inside, it's a comfortable space with a bar along one side, and a 70's retro feel.  I ordered smoked salmon Benedict for $12.95, which also included the following:  over a half-dozen sections of pineapple, grapes, citrus, and melon; two pieces each of sausage, bacon, and ham; sauteed fresh mushrooms, home fries, and a quarter of a baguette.  It appears the prix fixe brunch includes all of that, and everything served was high quality, fresh, and beautifully presented.So why only three stars?  The service was completely disfunctional.  When I arrived just before 11:00, only about six of the 30 or so tables were occupied, yet both servers were clearly getting frazzled.  An hour later, with the place fully occupied, they were completely overwhelmed.  There were long lines of people waiting to be seated, waiting for menus, waiting to give their orders, waiting for their food, waiting for their check, and waiting to pay.  Tables could have been turned in about half the time it actually took if the dining room were run efficiently.  It's ironic that once orders went in, they came out in a timely fashion. So if you're a patient person who enjoys well-prepared, fresh and high quality food, head on over.  Otherwise, you might prefer someplace that has a bit more respect for your time."

/user_details?userid=2T7IWnZjZcifxS305CprUQ,Sophie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had their brunch on a week-end, with the place bursting with people. They serve the usual breakfast fare, eggs, Benedicts, waffles, etc. The price is fair, given the ginormous portion of food served.One hiccup during my visit; each of the plates came with a small bowl of fruits. That day, it was a mixture of melons, one of which clearly had gone bad. There were only a few bits of melon in each cup of fruit so by the time we realized and spit it out, we didn't have any left to show the kitchen.The decor is fresh, modern, vibrant and green, and everything looks quite new.I would come back if I was in need of a breakfast fix with friends, but this spot does not stand out from the crop of other similar priced and similar menu-ed brunch restaurants in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=QiPJJSFEYOzXAr-INMF8Gg,Rachel L.,"McKinney, TX",4 star rating,Varied menu offered many different types of options. The grilled trout was especially good. This place is very reasonably priced for food that would cost more than 2x the price downtown or in Old Montreal.

/user_details?userid=tAbsoPztS95_QRASN1APQg,Ja'miey K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For the area, it's hard to beat the price point at Bistro Tôt ou Tard. And that's before one considers how delicious and traditional some of their French cuisine is. The mussels and fries are great, and with numerous sauses to choose from (I recommend the champignon à la crème). The rognon de veau (kidney) is served with steamed vegetables and is tender. Get their soupe maison if its the soup of the day, which is lemon, tomato, chic pea and cilantro. The servers are friendly and bilingual. Previously a Universal that closed, the decor was left behind and shows its turn of the millenium stylings of flood lighting and faux stonework. A large covered terrace makes for rain-proof outdoor dining, and they have televisions that show the game. Good food, especially their pasta bakes, fish and and crème brûlée. There is a lot of booth seating, and a view of the park. Unpretentious, laid back and affordable."
/user_details?userid=1Xldkyl3D39ReRRNfbzG9g,Matt D.,"Auburn, ME",5 star rating,"As others have said, really good food & portions for the price. We were looking for a cheap place for brunch in the plateau area, and this was just around the corner from the place we stayed. The menu is only in french, but the waitress was happy to answer our questions. We each tried a different type of crepe and were all satisfied and surprised to find that they came with eggs, toast and lots of fresh fruit. Mine was about $8, and my friends whose orders included bacon/sausage were around $13.Since it's in the ground floor of an office building(i think), there was quite a lunchtime rush. When we arrived at 11 there were 3 tables occupied, and prolly 12 by the time we left. Unlike others on here i didn't think the service was poor/slow, the 2 waiters did a great job of keeping up with the rush while being friendly."

Even though it was packed and only two waitresses we didn't have to wait that long for our food. Waited a bit to get the check.  But the food... Delicious!! And they took care of us non-french speaking tourists.
/user_details?userid=SggXkzdNnQLmwOiTJMbG2Q,Amanda H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Excellent brunch! Bear in mind, portions are HUGE. We had the eggs benedict, which was great, and the fig/date crepes, which were simply amazing and quite possibly the best crepes we've ever had. Both brunch dishes came with ham, bacon, AND sausage, which upon reading the menu I thought was a typo, but was in fact the reality. I don't think I've never had a larger portioned brunch before. I finished about half of mine. The bloody mary was also very good, although not made with horseradish, which I almost always prefer. It's also located right at the corner of the park, which provided excellent people watching. I highly recommend!"
