I yelped best jjajangmeyeon (black bean noodles) in Montreal, and this is the place that came up. We also ordered sweet & sour pork and kimchi fried rice as well as a bottle of soju to go. They couldn't have been nicer. The guy who took our order welcomed us in to wait with hand sanitizer and when we went to pay, the ajjima poked her head from the kitchen out to thank us. As if that weren't enough, there was a thank you note attached to our order! I was touched. You can really tell when your order makes an impact on a small, local business. I haven't yet gotten into the food (it smells great, as I write this!) but already I feel like based on service alone, I'd come back.PS the food was PERFECT - authentic, tasty & great price! HIGHLY recommend!"
/user_details?userid=JL2uB3BoQT6gvGWiMWK_6Q,Lily L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Ordered some jajangmyeong bc I was craving it recently. The food came quite quickly and definitely hit the spot. I remember when chez bong used to make homemade noodles for this dish but now they no longer do so! Nevertheless the dish was yummy and I would order it again.
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good Korean food for good value! Came here on a Saturday night and there weren't any other customers, this place is super underrated! It's a bit hidden and the decor is really dingy, so I guess it might put some people off.Service was extremely fast and friendly, but maybe it's because there weren't that many customers.We got a combo for two, which included a black bean pork noodle dish, a spicy seafood noodle soup, and sweet and sour pork. If you get a combo, it's about $5 cheaper than getting the items separately! The food was stardard fare, nothing to complain about but nothing too spectacular. The portions are large and has great flavour. Just kinda wished they would give better side starters (along with the kimchi). Also the pork dish was wild, there was a side of coleslaw topped with ketchup and random pears and papaya in the sauce. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for an affordable and tasty Korean meal downtown."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Just got back from a glorious lunch at Chez Bong full of sticky, sweet and spicy, peanut-crusted Korean fried chicken and everybody needs to know about it. I'm going to say best fried chicken I've had outside of Nashville, call me crazy. The fried chicken comes in servings for 2, but we had a bunch leftover so I think you could share between 3. We did half regular and have sweet and spicy, loved being able to go back and forth with some banchan in between and taste the flavours in the sauce and the batter, and in whatever that black dipping sauce was (fermented black bean?)We also shared a kimchi jjigae spicy stew with pork belly, because it was cold and rainy outside (endlessly) and it was the perfect thing. Everything was light and fresh and not over greasy. It was quiet for a Tuesday lunch, classical music playing as we sat alone in the heritage building that houses this unpretentious spot and the staff were warm and friendly and there were tons of other things on the menu I wanted to try. Can't wait to go back. Go support these folks when near Concordia if you like Korean food, or comfort food, or food generally!"
/user_details?userid=W-1EszyEOgGmi5sWKc3-aA,JS L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I used to love it here and went to Chez Bong a lot in the past but over the years and tonight, I can definitely say that quality has gone down.I liked that the place isn't too noisy and easy to carry a conversation. Food came out quick and the waitress was polite.They are legit Koreans cooking Korean food but skimping on meat from jjajangmyeon/black bean noodle (but a ton of hard undercooked onion) and kimchi-jigae did not make me very happy. I still finished my jjajangmyeon, it was still very edible but I wish the food had a little more flavor... maybe it was chef's off night."
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I LOVE Korean food and this is definitely among my top 3 favorite Korean restaurants in the city.First of all, the atmosphere is great: it is usually very quiet, most of the time there are only a handful of other customers in the restaurant. So you can relax and take your time eating while having conversations where you don't have to scream to hear each other. The music varies between classical and k-pop depending on the visit, both not very loud.Secondly, they have the best pajeon in the city. BY FAR. I have to take that every time I visit, even if I'm not that hungry. The portion is huge, the pieces are nicely cut so you can eat them in one bite and don't have to tear all the green onion out, and the ratio of flour vs ingredients is just right. The dough is very chewy, which is not the case in most pajeons I've tasted in Montreal, even though that's part of the definition of a pajeon.Other items I often take are the soups: kimchi or sundubu jiggae. Very flavourful and the right amount of spicy. The jajjangmein is also very tasty, and only 9$. I would suggest not mixing all the sauce in the noodles at once, because it might be too salty for some. The newly added fried chicken is also among the best I've tasted in town, both the original and the sweet and spicy ones. They tend to have a bit more grease, so that the chicken is not dry at all. The only thing I would not advise is the Gam Ja Tang: it may look good, but there's not enough saltiness or richness at all and the potato chunks are huge, so that the flavour can't get in.All in all, this restaurant is among the most underrated ones in Montreal, which might be a good thing for regulars since it's always so calm, but it's just so good I had to share :)"
/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I'll give four stars for this restaurent. The service is slow but they make it good. I work right next to this place. I came often with my boss for a dinner. If you know Korea's food then you know how they make it. We tried lot of dishes. Special the boneless chicken. Really good. Also the fried chicken with peanut sauce. Or half peanut half spicy.

And my friend tasted something expired or not cleaned well.This is not normal for a restaurant, will not go back and i do not recommend anyone to eat here."
/user_details?userid=T3v74g5KY0H2fiSGD8dY9Q,Eric S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Nice and quiet place, authentic korean food! Service was quite fast and delicious. Came here with my family and everyone was satisfied. I personally loved the black bean noodles Jjajangmyun! If you like authentic korean cuisine and a peaceful ambiance, here's the place!"
/user_details?userid=SSrxVJTiQX5noMU2YcNyoQ,JI Won K.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It has real Korean food and Korean Chinese food. Montreal has a lot of Korean restaurant and I saw some nice pictures on instagram. But they're not as delicious as in interior or pictures.Here is kind of hidden gem, please try other than very typical Korean dishes."
/user_details?userid=2XK55HjzkGQqVszQYCr34Q,Catherine B.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",1 star rating,"This was the worst experience, I did not receive what I ordered. It was cold, smelled foul,  and I had certain customizations to my order and specifically asked if they could call me if there was an issue- they put a POST IT note in my order telling me I can call and order sauce on the side.. like what?! This doesn't make sense at all. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else"
/user_details?userid=xNvP0PJnvDGkHSv6DIZWBQ,Simón L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a big place where you could come in with a group and the ambiance is comfortable and quiet, but the decoration and maintainance needs some work... I've only tried one plate, the black bean noodles and it was good, I noticed the menu had photos in it so you could actually ""see"" what you order, but didn't see any description in English or french, which would have been nice. Overall a good place to enjoy good korean Chinese food."
/user_details?userid=sfulPDNnoymxAK50_qc8Ug,Jun K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This is one of the most authentic Korean-Chinese restaurants I have been to all my life. If you like Korean-Chinese food, this place is a must try...whether you live in Montreal or just passing by. My wife and I visited three times during our one week stay during the Jazz Festival and will definitely visit again next time we are here! The spicy noodle soup is the best ever for hangover~"
/user_details?userid=fYUPJGtYc9NxtQTTiJ4wOg,Regina B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3 star rating,"It was a long drive from niagara falls to montreal and my sister had to have soju, lol. It was very cozy little place however food was just okay.  We were exhausted and starving from the drive. We enjoyed company of each other but there was a couple of loud young drunks disturbing peace. My mom ordered Jambong, which was quite good. My sister ordered spicy pork stir fry completely soaked in OIL. And i had Sundubu soup, which was not bad. There is potential to be better place as i see it, if they can take constructed criticism."
/user_details?userid=s8u_sq3dUBIgAapO_sFUww,July K.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Bad.. We were craving for korean food while our Montréal trip, so we decided to go to Chez bong after few research. Food quality was really bad; restaurant was empty too. I felt really sorry to people who wants to try Korean-Chinese food in Montreal if it's best option for them. Or maybe we ordered wrong menu.. I had Jjambong Soup with Rice, I could find a few piece of squid and veggies and uncooked(!!) glass noodle on my soup. also kimchi stew had 5,6 pieces of dried pork in it. (They said its pre made soup, so we can not adjust spice level). So i don't recommend this place at all..even one star is so much to give them."
/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"It was acceptable. Service was a-ok, taste was a-ok, price was a-ok. I would give it a 3.5 stars if I could."
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"just discoved this place, maybe because it is a bit hidden since it is not on the main street. one of my friend who lived in korea for over 10 years told me that this place offers the most authentic korean dishes. I tasted the jajanmyun (not sure i spell it right...) and it was really tasty. The sauce was thick and dark, just like in the korean dramas, and tasted okay. The bibimbap had a weird taste though... but i like the fact that the bol was not in rock like most korean restaurant so that my rice didnt burn at the bottom, i dont like my rice crispyThe japchae was really flavourful and chewy, the best ive tried so far.The pork bones soup with rice (i forgot the name of the dish) looks good but tastes bad... it hurts me to leave a bad comment but the broth tasted like water mixed with red pepper flakes and the meat was dry (felt like frozen meat) and didn't come off easily off the bones like it should. The place is quiet and theres not a lot of people during lunch. One con is that they don't offer as much side dish as the other restaurant. They only gave cubed kimchi and the yellow raddish. The place is not bad, so I'll probably come again. They have some korean dishes in theur menu that I have not seen in other restaurants"

/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of the best korean restaurant I've ever been. Everything is good and they make the best bibimbap in town. This is my go-to place everytime!

/user_details?userid=9ZFO-Eqkv_L_BaE3-KXtLQ,Gigi R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"My husband and I love Korean food, and have it a lot. Here, I gave it an average rating. The staff is friendly, and the space is pretty nice. Food is okay, because we had better ones. The seafood sun tofu soup barely has any seafood, seriously. The flavor is fine, but it's almost just plain tofu soup. Same for the seafood pancake - very little seafood. But I have to say, the pancake is very well cooked - soft inside and crunchy outside. I think it would be better just to be a little more generous with the ingredients, even if that has to drive the price up a little bit."
/user_details?userid=_b6u_JPQU3TwG4vQdCO23A,Roland F.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,Got their soon tofu and found their cuisine to be quite traditional. The place was quiet and the food was good. Something I missed would be the sweet potato appetizers you sometimes get as a side dish. Overall I would recommend.

/user_details?userid=Qphpn3R6pzdqgw1uWDHF7A,Mollie A.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"My family was looking for a restaurant that served Korean style Chinese when we saw this place listed on Yelp. The restaurant was very close to our restaurant. We came for an early dinner on a Sunday, and the restaurant was practically deserted - which was fine by me. We ordered a dinner combo including black bean noodles, spicy seafood noodles, and sweet and sour pork. In addition, we ordered a fried rice. The food took a little while to be served - maybe 20-25 minutes? We waited quite a while after the pork was brought to us for any of the other dishes to be served. I thought the food was actually pretty decent - a lot better than placed I'd been back home. The seafood noodles, however, didn't taste like the Korean spicy seafood noodles I had always had, I think they used anchovy broth instead of the more usual chicken broth. It was also not very spicy and did not have the salty content that the noodles normally do - but the dish itself didn't taste bad. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour pork - it was probably my favorite out of all the dishes. I would probably come back for another visit if I were in the area."

/user_details?userid=N4uOabfndsMZSnzMZqPuOQ,Joy S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I don't usually post reviews, in fact, I have never posted a review even for any famous four star restaurants. This little place is a hidden gem!  I came here from NYC during my trip to Montreal and I am a Korean, so I am very much spoiled and picky when it comes to dining-outs, especially for Korean or Korean-Chinese food.  I dined here THREE times out of 7 days of my stay in Montreal because the food is unreal!  Firstly, I had Jaengban Chajang Myun (noodle) and Gochu Jabchae, which was heavenly.  On my second visit, I had Chajang Myun/Chambong combo. The Chambong here is probably the best Chambong I ever had in my life!!! The noodle was nicely tangy and the soup was rich and spicy without MSG!!  All the seafood toppings were so fresh!! The most wonderful thing about food here is it's just like home cooking. Unlike the overly Americanized/sweetened New York city's Asian food, they make authentic Korean-Chinese food, just right.  On my third visit today, I ordered Chambong Bab (rice) and Gungjung Dduckboki.  So excited about another best culinary experience!  Will definitely come here again on my next visit in Montreal!!"
/user_details?userid=-0kjjV5UQUHf0hk9RMJXCQ,Nayoung S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,korean style chinese restaurant. I was looking for this kind of korean style chinese restaurant and it perfectly lived up to my expectation. Jjajangmyun and tangsuyuk was really good!
