Nice location, attractive restaurant decor. Reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend and will return next time we are visiting canada."
/user_details?userid=y-mwVNTsWOFxRsdcvdGVlA,Marc M.,"Sainte-Thérèse, Canada",4 star rating,I've been here before. They seem out of place in the heart of little Italy but I'm not complaining. Pretty good dumplings at a very reasonable pricy. They many options as filling. Peanut sauce is not available unfortunately. Friendly service with plastic payment available. They're quick for takeout. Good find
/user_details?userid=kSz3wSUHilFrXuop8QnLZA,Elizabeth G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"The dumplings here are very delicious and there are many flavors and combinations to choose from. Kids loved the veggie friend rice. General Tso chicken was very tasty. Comes with white rice.  Very clean place, including the restrooms. Friendly staff."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is OK and I eat here because it's the only dumpling place around. However, its dumplings are inferior to many, many other place in Montreal. They are quite dry and not very flavourful. The vegetarian ones are way too salty. I recommend the pork & bok choy ones as somehow it seems like the bok choy keeps the dumpling more juicy. I've been trying many flavours and have yet to find another one I deem good. Service speed varies from normal to slow/very slow, so it's a risk if you are on a schedule. Same for to-go. I waited around 25 minutes for a to-go box of 12 dumplings."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been back here a bunch. When you give a place 5 stars there's lots of context to consider and in this case the stars are in part reflective of the sad fact that there are basically no real Chinese options in this area, and I love Chinese food and this place is good. They have really tasty vegetarian options, including a bunch of different vegetarian dumpling fillings including some delicious ones with tafo and eggs. It's such a relief to find super tasty vegetarian food that actually gives you protein. The service has gotten better here over time, quick and friendly. I've tried a lot of the menu items and the flavours are complex and great and I'm super happy this spot is in my neighbourhood!"
/user_details?userid=cL5jML80rWAyzC1z_v4HWw,Clarence W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I don't like to write negative reviews, but this place kinda sucks. I've gone twice and both times my take-out orders took forever and the dumplings were mediocre.First time, my simple take-out order took 35 min to receive...and the restaurant was empty. But I thought it might have been an off night, the dumplings were okay, so I thought I'd give them another try.This time, I order my food, paid, am told it will take 12 min. I come back in 15...and they hadn't even started cooking them yet. This was also in an empty / non-busy time. And when I finally received the dumplings, they just weren't that good. Chewy and bland.I don't think I need to give a place three chances.The only reason I can explain this place's good ratings here is Montréal's obsession with mediocre ""Asiatique"" food."

It's impossible to finish the plate haha Not to crowded so a good place to eat peacefully and they have a terrasse outside so you can eat outside if you prefer. I definitely recommend this place, the service is awesome and the prices are fair enough."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Came across this hidden gem in the heart of Little Italy and loved it!  The resto itself is cozy and has back room area for small group reservations. Now let's get down to the food!  The dumplings were absolutely delicious ...fresh ingredients and packed with flavor. You can ask them for peanut butter sauce on the side or they have a home made picant sauce that accompanies their amazing dumplings!  Dumplings come in different fillings and they have choice of steamed or fried.  I would definitely recommend ordering different types and sharing with friends! The resto also has other classic asian dishes such as noodles and rice....we also had the chicken vegetable noodles and loved it!  This was truly and authentic asian experience! Service is also super warm and friendly. Will definitely go back!
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Checked out this new spot last night with a handful of friends. They've only been open month which might explain why it was pretty quiet--the food is definitely not the reason!The menu includes skewered meats, hand made noodle dishes, homemade dumplings and a bunch of other appetizers. The food we ordered was tasted and well received by all. The fried eggplant stuffed with pork was very flavourful, the shrimp are large and crispy, the spring rolls are pretty good too. We had a few vegetarians so we asked if they might make a general tao tofu since they had the chicken version on the menu. Not only did they happily agree to make it, they also offered to make some tofu and veg dumplings for us. Both hit the spot. We were brought free samples as well which was very thoughtful. The noodle dishes and the dumplings were the highlight for me. Noodles are thick and have a good bite and the garnishes are fresh and well balanced. The meat dumplings were juicy and generously stuffed. Dipping sauce were on point. The one thing that was less well received was the cold tofu appetizer. Next time we'll try the fried one. And, maybe a limited time thing, ALL booze was 50% off. Prices were already decent so this made it really cheap, yay! Overall, I liked the food, service was great and prices were fair. Will definitely be back. Very happy to have this in the neighbourhood!"
/user_details?userid=Ro00qQOG5fIrFCXMStjzrQ,Nicolas C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The dumplings are fantastic and come in a huge variety that I'm really looking forward to exploring over time. So far, I've only had the beef & coriander ones (steamed), but they were big, juicy and super flavourful. I think I'll try some fried ones next, and I can hardly wait. As for the rest of the menu, I've only tried the wonton soup and the General Tao chicken so far, but they were both great. The broth in the soup was perfect, and the General Tao was crispy without being too hard, and just the right amount of sweet (really tasty but not at all overpowering).The portions aren't very big and the prices aren't very low, but the food is super fresh and expertly made on the spot, and the service is warm and welcoming. Plus, quality Chinese comfort food is something that's been lacking in the area, so I hope this place will thrive and continue to fill that gap. I look forward to going back with friends and working my way through the menu."
/user_details?userid=8o8FTy_rvKaC5YoQgZENgg,Yoonha K.,"Jersey City, NJ",2 star rating,"I personally get never impressed with chinese food or their way of managing restaurants. Sadly, this one failed me as well. The pork dumplings had this weird meat smell and also the general tao chicken came with rice soaked in sauce. I will need to drink 2 gallons of water after."
/user_details?userid=fr2uzL4G7NeqdEWaUEkyfw,S L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I am not sure why others gave it a great review. I was very disappointed for many reasons. If I could, I would give it 0 stars.1) first thing, the tables were not very clean. 2) The dumplings were not very good at all. It is the worst that I have ever had. Skin is rubbery and the meat inside was very hard and dry. Proper dumpling should be moist and juicey and smooth.3) fried dumplings were burnt.Dumplings are best in Chinatown."
/user_details?userid=16XDM4M2G8NvLVLLOhM1nA,Sandrine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice dumpling spot in little Italy! We had 24 and we were two and it was more than enough. The flavors are amazing ! We even took an extra order to go. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night. Good place for a cheap dinner.2nd time there. Service still slow. But food is good."
/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,Another great find thanx to yelp. Firstly their spice was amazing and with a heavenly smell. Dumplings were awesome as we had lamb with cumin and fried with coriander.eggplant so good. Maybe a little sweet but it hit the G spot. I will be back.

/user_details?userid=pvLTc0lpmeDfa1VLr1iljQ,Daly R.,"Bois-des-Filion, Canada",5 star rating,"This is by far the best dumpling place I've been! Since my first visit I've become addicted and go at least once a week to order takeout! The food is amazing, the service is great and the vibe is awesome."
/user_details?userid=ZRYqMyXtb-kmHIhDrRdI0Q,A. U.,"Cote-Saint-Luc, Canada",2 star rating,"I was really disappointed. I knew it was a bad omen when they had to scrounge for obsolete English menus, which I had to cross-reference with the French menus on the table. We waited forever for our food. We ended up ordering an appetiser to tide us over, but it still took way too long to get our dumplings. The management ended up giving us a free wakame salad because of the wait, reiterating that the dumplings are handmade. Handmade and made to order are not the same, and it's probably not smart to make to order on a busy Friday night. When the dumplings arrive, they were all mixed up and the waitress didn't identify which was which. The dough was thicker than I was expecting and water dripped out of them when you bit into them. Not impressed; there are better dumpling restos out there."
/user_details?userid=qSEsjIiXb-TTua0vLR1-0A,Dominic D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've been to China the past three summers and the food at Etoile Rouge reminded me of the food I ate over there instantly. I ordered the pork brochette and it smelled authentic. Then I tasted it and it was like I was right back in China. It was great.
/user_details?userid=L2Xen_Sw2qQs1SuWbUaiJA,The Di G.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,"If you think Chinese food in the Little Italy of French Canada can't be good, well...you've got another thing comin'!  Three of us dumpling boys popped in here yesterday and boy, were we not disappointed.  I saw that Boone Boy had ordered his 'soup style,' and I thought 'mmm I think I'm going to do the same.'  And I was happy.  The TV was showing a women's fitness competition, which was a surprisingly nice compliment to our delicious dumplings.  Three thumbs up!"
/user_details?userid=UR8dw8qY4MQj11rS4bBcCg,Emile T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a nice find! Hot and sour soup was the best I ever had and the dumplings were delicious. You can choose between steamed, fried or in a chicken broth. Loved the quality of the food. We will be back, thank you!"
/user_details?userid=-xXZq7Lf7_OGahqe33iq2A,L ..,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. He ordered general tao. I ordered dumplings.. Not only was the general tao sauce seemingly straight out of a bottle, but his dish was brought out 45 minutes before mine. When the waitress realized how long I spent waiting for my dish, she ran out of the restaurant to chain smoke and call someone to come finish her shift... thats what seems to have happened from what I gather. I kid you not. Totally unacceptable! Bummer of an experience and I'll (sadly) probably never go back."
/user_details?userid=6p6qJaar715yMMufid7frA,E O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The dumplings, noodles and three vegetable dish were all amazing! And half price on a booze!!! So happy to have them in the neighbourhood."
/user_details?userid=Uqw2LIgv-bbu8HUg5fqqNQ,Chloe M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"An amazing addition to the neighbourhood, great, great dumplings and wonderful staff. Decor is great, they are super kid friendly and the food is very authentic and all homemade. Note that the food can take some time to come out as it is all homemade on the spot."
