/user_details?userid=-P0tSMT2EkEjPEjkZ5ZhGA,Marcela D.,"Albany, NY",5 star rating,"A small corner restaurant in a relatively residential neighboorhood, Maison Publique would be easy to drive by without realizing. It's a good thing my boyfriend loves good food and just plain cool restaurants. We visited Maison Publique in the middle of a snowstorm in late December after making a reservation on the app Resy (it was very quick and easy-- I recommend it). We were seated at the bar, which was truly the best seat in the house as we were able to view the chefs in the kitchen whipping up all manner of adventurous and delicious food. Surrounded by eclectic decor and buzzing patrons, we were ready to place our orders.We began with a delicious and well-balanced Boulevardier cocktail-- the bourbon was a warm welcome from the winter chill still on our coats and in our bones. After taking a look at the menu, which is essentially a wall with hand-written specials tacked up, we decided on two dishes we did not want to go without (the sweetbreads and foie gras with gingerbread and cranberries), and then had the staff give us their recommendations for our other 5 dishes. Maison Publique is best enjoyed when you are with dining partner(s) who do not mind sharing (again, enter the joy of having a partner who is curious and voracious an eater as I am). We began with a bitter salad of endive, radicchio, pear, dressed with a tangy vinaigrette, then moved onto the next plate of fish crudo in another vinaigrette with toasted buckwheat and thinly sliced radishes. Next we moved onto the fois gras served with gingerbread and cranberries. It was exquisite-- everything we could have dreamed of. Since it was my first time trying the dish, I was instructed to take a slice of the gingerbread, pile it high with fois gras, top it with some onion and cranberry, and enjoy.  Next, we enjoyed the sweetbreads-- breaded and gently fried on a vegetable puree, and topped with an elegant agrodolce. Wow. just wow. It was almost like it melted in my mouth, and the bitter/sour shock of the agrodolce complimented the rich fattiness of the sweetbreads so so beautifully. Our final savory dishes were a white fish and a lamb ragu on homemade pasta with a broccoli rabe pesto (?? I want to call it pesto, but it was so much more than that). Our meal had the perfect end punctuation of a superb homage to Canada: a maple pots de creme with a shortbread cookie. We cannot wait to return to Montreal for another amazing dining experience at Maison Publique."

We came late for brunch but got a nice table. The staff was really friendly and attentive and helped us decide and translated the menu. We decided on the smoked salmon... it was like butter!!! The best! Ever... sausage with tomatoes...and cheese and this combo was fantastic, simple but fantastic. And my kid had the small portion of the most delicious, fluffiest pancakes ever. And we even got complementary soft serve ice cream... and it was delicious, berries and cream. Truly enjoyed everything about my experience here."

With an English pub vibe to it, Maison Publique is strictly using only Canadian ingredients. There's no way I could have taken a picture of the deer sausage without it looking inappropriate or unappealing. A sausage still remains a sausage! Unfortunately Maison Publique did not impress me with their brunch menu as I am constantly comparing every brunch restaurant to La Fabrique. I wouldn't say it was a bad- it was good, but not amazing. Priced at $14.00, the deer sausage was paired with tomatoes and blue cheese. The perfect balance in my humble opinion. How was your experience at Maison Publique? I'm genuinely willing to give it a second shot, but maybe for their dinner service."

In the meanwhile we'll always have Maison Publique. Their grilled duck hearts are tattooed on my brain forever. Very tastefully done. Killer pasta. Top top shelf service. Comfortable accomodations. Everything is class.
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I can't believe we haven't been to Maison Publique sooner! It was rated #6 in Canada in 2018 and I think that rating is on point. I'm not sure why its rated as a 4 star resto, we definitely had a 5 star + experience!Maison Publique serves creative dishes with interesting flavour pairings and adventurous ingredients but in a very casual cozy setting. The resto is split into 2 rooms, both are dining rooms but I really enjoyed being seated at the back near the window because it was quieter than the front of the restaurant. We could have ordered all the dishes on the menu but we settled on 13 dishes. We were 5 people with average appetites and we shared 9 plates + 4 desserts.Dishes that stood out and would certainly order again:-albacore tuba with grapefruit and black radishes-baked oyster, which was huge!! We were all able to take a sizeable mouthful to taste!-roast pork with vegetablesdesserts: All were delicious but I found the grandmother tart to be the most unique! It was a custardy pie with roasted pine nuts on top, very very good!I highly recommend Maison Publique, I'm really looking forward to going back!"

We got there and we were seated right away, we wanted to sit by the bar where we can see the kitchen too. We got our beers and had to go to the back of the restaurant to see the food menu, which I thought was kind of cheesy for a high class restaurant where you spend more $$$, anyways we took a picture of the wall menu because it's was weird to stand there and obsess over what to order. Menu was all in French and not offered in English which I thought was a minus on their side.We googled and browsed and decided what to order, I feel like the bartender could have been more help while he was standing in front of us while we were trying to decide what to order. A brief explanation of the menu would have been nice, especially cause we told him it was our first time.Over all food was great, but portions are small. Service could have been better for the amount of money you spend there. Tapas menu have been the norm nowadays."

So we got dressed and decided to check out this place.. I dont know how but we managed to find parking right in front in the middle of the street with all the snow.. we walked in and the place was empty! Maybe 2 people were there enjoying a winter meal.. now something my husband and I always do is seat at the bar/ kitchen.. we love to interact with the cooks / chefs , watch them cook ect it's part of the fun. Anyways .. we decided to just try everything .. one of the things was dear tongue.. I can't believe I'm writing this but it was the most decanted dish I ever had. I still talk about this dish to this day! .. the ambuance to the place was amazing and it's such a cute little cozy restaurant.. the snow storm just added a nice touch to it!"
/user_details?userid=Qa5_TNz8tXWVMtwDkueI9g,Justin K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Our last minute weekend getaway to Montreal brought us to this neighbourhood gem. We were fortunate to be seated at the bar directly in front of the kitchen window to see all of the action. Left it up to our server to choose everything, and he scratched out a series of words (duck, oyster, pork, beet, hamachi). Hamachi crudo, baked oyster, duck in an esca beche, beets with almonds, and pork cooked two ways - I couldn't help but appreciate the great oils and sauces used to highlight the star of each dish. Picking favourites was not easy since every dish felt well conceived; I used both recency and bacon bias in naming the pork as mine, while my girlfriend favoured the oyster.We finished the meal off with an apple cinnamon soft serve, which led to me buying an apple pie on the way back home the next day."

/user_details?userid=rNRWcUHMKuFgCWTFWX3SGA,Joey L.,"Morgantown, WV",5 star rating,"I could not have been happier with my experience at Maison Publique. I normally do not write reviews, but Maison Publique was truly spectacular.I was traveling alone when I arrived at the restaurant, but Brendan and the staff made me feel completely at home. I was new to Québécois cuisine, so I told them to make me a tasting menu.Their recommendations were truly wonderful. I had halibut cheeks, a Welsh rarebit, a smoked squash dish, a steak dish and foie gras. It was topped off with an incredible butterscotch pudding and great locally brewed beer.If you come to Montreal, this is the place to sample the local cuisine. The dishes were reasonably priced and it was truly one of the better dining experiences I've ever had."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Really lovely friend date here this weekend!! We rolled up on our bikes around 8:30pm to this warm glowing little gem on a leafy Plateau street without reservations. We waited about 10 minutes while they sorted us out and we were cozy inside by the big open window in no time. Our waiter was kind of abrupt at first but he warmed up as the night progress and in the end we really loved him, and his wine recommendations! We managed to eat 4 very delicious vegetarian dishes here, which can be tough in these terroir oriented places, and all were super delicious and innovative. Damage for 4 dishes and 4 glasses of wine was $60 each including tax, which is fairly standard for this type of place these days in Montreal. In all, it was a beautiful cozy room and a kind and delicious experience, definitely a place to come back to."

/user_details?userid=PuZydZ-7jrd50z1nNxRNew,Dennis M.,"Ridgewood, NJ",5 star rating,First time for us. I only wish I lived in Montreal so I could dine here more often. We were a party of two for dinner. At first I was disappointed that they were seating us at the bar but that turned out to be the best seats in the house. We had a bird's eye view into the kitchen and we had Jack to guide us through the evening. Jack patiently walked us through each dish all the while asking us questions about our taste preferences. We had 5 plates to share each was more delicious than the previous dish. So stop reading and make a reservation.
/user_details?userid=R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This small restaurant has a lot of charm, perfect dinner place for couples.For a change the menu in on the wall on a black board. Don't be surprised if you see people taking pictures of that board. I was seated next to it, therefore I didn't take any pictures.The place is a bit dark, wich makes it an even cosier place for the winter season. You will find inside, on the shelves, old and retro items from books to figurines. The food is very good, it is a very well know establishment, where your taste buds will be more than happy. We had the oyster au four, magret de canard and the fish of the day. The oyster was amazing made with beer, ognon and a bechamel sauce. The magret de canard was tender and melting.And the fish with beats was good. The plate are served one after the other and are made to be shared.Under the table you will find a small drawer with cutlery and napkins. They serve amazing drinks, we had a casual gin tonic.Finally, i can say that the service was very decent, our waiter was more than happy to explain each plate and what comes with it."
/user_details?userid=HkP_mEM6SUworGMAfWY5gw,Stefania W.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was really excited to come to Maison Publique for the first time; however, it turned out to be a disappointment.When we were seated, the server immediately told us we had the table for 2 hours. That wasn't a problem because that is plenty of time for us to enjoy dinner. After we ordered drinks, we asked him for recommendations on the dishes and he said ""Are you difficult? I can put together a menu for you. So, are you difficult?"" His demeanour made us uncomfortable and we thought his question was rather rude. We chose the dishes on our own and the food was delicious. Before we were done eating the final main dish, the server asked us if we wanted the bill. At that point, there was still 45 minutes left until the end of the 2 hours. We felt pressured to finish eating and leave.Overall, I think that the one server severely tainted our experience. He was rude and ruined our first time at this highly reputed restaurant. While the food is delicious, it is not enough to convince me to return."
/user_details?userid=ePAPDXkPg4eMKe2d9GYK-g,Brian S.,"Lexington, KY",5 star rating,"This was a great find. It's a corner restaurant in the heart of a very pleasant neighborhood of townhomes, not far from the mont-royal stop on the orange line. We went for breakfast, joining the small group of other patrons clustered outside waiting for it to open at 10:00. The inside had a homey feel, with old patterned wallpaper, a little bit of taxidermy, and framed photos of toddlers, kids and grandparents on the walls. Our server was patient with our limited French and explained the menu well. My wife ordered pancakes and I had sausage, fried egg and grilled squash. The server talked us into ordering a side of their fried potatoes, and we were so glad he did. They had a little sausage mixed in, with chives and a few other savory additions. But the creme fraiche put it over the top! I strongly recommend ordering them!"

/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if it's a hidden gem on plateau  with moderate pricing. However, knowing that it's rated one of the best in Montreal (and I am a proud Montrealer who believe that we have some of the best restaurants in the world), I find it hard to understand its popularity. We went twice to have the full experience: once at night and once for brunch. The dinner menu was well-executed but very salty, as it is claimed as a "" British pub-style "" cuisine, you may need to consider drinking a lot of beer to wash down the salty food. For the fish & seafood dishes, it seems like the secret ingredients are always: salted butter & lots of capers (guess why they are so salty). Feel like I could make similar one at home on a day that I feel lazy or hangover with no recipes in mind. Luckily, i have my salty taste bud so I did enjoy my meal. However, as a foodie, I would not put this place on the top of my very long list of places to try. It's also worth mentioning that as their "" specialty "" for brunch, the scotch egg turns out to be very average (follow BBC food, one of the most boring food blogs online and you could make one just as good). Meanwhile, the quiet restaurant les Fillettes a few km away(never has a line up) made a scotch egg 10 times better for their St Patrick's day special (which they do once per year instead of everyday). Sometimes it's worth reflecting why some restaurants are so popular, are you influenced by the reputation or your own instinct"

Finally might as well leave a review, in which I simply want to express how great this place is. The food is ALWAYS quality, the atmosphere cozy and inviting, and the staff attentive - overall I think the restaurant nails it and I'll keep coming back as long as I'm around. The brunch has made this place famous in my 'hood, but there hasn't been a night I've been let down, after probably 30+ or so visits the last several years. The food is local and they serve some of the best wine Canada produces."
/user_details?userid=tUd9u1JY76i1Cu_TD098aQ,Michael H.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"This was a great restaurant and beyond surprising.  First off we had our 21 month old son with us and they were awesome in accommodating us with him.  We made a reservation right when they opened (6pm) and called ahead to make sure kids are OK, they said they had 2 highchairs so it worked out great getting there early.  There aren't any ""kids"" menu items besides the Welsh Rarebit but he enjoyed some of the pork on the salad we got and the chef even drew a picture for him & offered him the markers to draw with.  The whole staff was amazing with him and made us feel welcome.As far as the food for us the drinks were on point & they make a good old fashioned.  The food was great, we started with the oyster which was one of the highlights and an indescribable umami taste.  As for the other highlights my wife had the chicken dish and the pot de creme at the end was a great quick dessert.  In short, if in Montreal don't hesitate."
/user_details?userid=SpCFKj1ohSP_dfgb_K6YeA,Phuong T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I love pancakes. Especially on a Sunday - for some odd reason. And I'm picky about my pancakes. I want them to be golden brown and ever so slightly crispy on the exterior edges - but fluffy without being dense. And I want real maple syrup with my pancakes. And bacon. Because, well, it's bacon!!Back home in Montreal my very favourite place for pancakes is Maison Publique in the Plateau area. Incidentally, I once lived in that very neighbourhood. But of course, I only discovered Maison Publique after I had moved away. Still, I'd make a trek there - for their pancakes, which are topped with their crispy bacon and some hot peppers...giving it just the right kick! And let's not forget the real maple syrup. Yup, this is the real deal. You're welcome in advance ;-)"
/user_details?userid=m_7elkDE_kTEh65xHt5y4w,Larissa L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow. One of the best meals I've had in Montreal. Every single dish we ordered was above excellent. Service was a little weird, though. It took kind of forever to get the waiter's attention, because he was very busy with several other tables. And when we ordered (one entrée and one main each) we were informed, rather than asked, that we would be sharing every dish, because they would come out of the kitchen one at a time. Ok then, that wasn't the plan, but fine.... And then the food started to arrive and we forgot about the rest!!! We had the pâté de foie and the horse carpaccio, then the tuna and the quail. All perfect, ingredients and flavours perfectly blending together. For dessert, the 'milles crêpes'. I can't even tell which was my favourite part. Can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"Loved, loved, loved this place! From the laid back tavern like ambiance to the deliciously prepared food and amazing discovery of Canadian wines, this place is as solid as it gets! We were lucky enough to sit at the bar and have a view of the kitchen as the line cooks expertly dished out each plate with TLC. Our waiter happened also to be the bar man and expertly picked out a wine that fitted our tastes. Their wines are mostly Canadian which had me very hesitant at first since what kind of wine could be possibly produce with our cold climate?! But a real surprise as a gamay from Ontario delivered across the board!   The menu changes quite frequently but given that it was our first visit we opted for the timeless items. We started with the parfait of foie gras, served with pickles and their house bread. Delicious! The texture was beautiful and packed a punch of garlic flavour that only complimented the taste of foie gras. We continued with the maiale tonnato which was a house made pork charcuterie slathered with a Dijon mayo sauce and topped with shaved parmesan. I'm not a huge fan of cold cuts but was pleasantly surprised. Not too salty as charcuterie can tend to be and the fatty part of the meat wasn't too greasy tasting either. We continued with the cappallacci à l'ortie stuffed with ricotta. Divine! Best pasta dish I've had since Italy! Cooked al dente, the ortie adding a bit of freshness and the ricotta was just perfectly grainy in texture. Drizzled in a bit of olive oil, I would have eaten 20 of them! We also tried the fried rabbit. First time eating rabbit for me and I was quite surprised at how light the meat tasted. It was covered in a very light batter and served as a very generous portion size. For fried chicken lovers out there, you gotta try this dish!Finally we ended with the Meyer lemon tart. Thin crust, nice consistency to the filling. Meyer lemons are not as tangly as a regular lemon and this tart highlighted that we'll both in its brightness and sweetness. Overall, I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. Will definitely be going back to try everything else on their menu as well as brunch!"

/user_details?userid=QcPN-Dee_dU2IWno-f2oYA,Lindsay T.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Maison Publique is ranked #21 of Canada's 100 Best Restaurants for 2016. It's a sneaky, inconspicuous restaurant. Their website and the restaurant's atmosphere bely a normal, neighborhood, corner gastropubs. But, their menu and chefs are anything but.They create a new menu everyday based on the ingredients they can source from local farms and friends; the sockeye salmon came from their fisherman friends in B.C. All four of us decided on the eight course tasting menu. It included salmon carpaccio, smoked rabbit, heirloom tomato and blue cheese salad, home-smoked meats, buffalo pantacotta, and a beautiful spread of desserts. The wine list is all local, there's a full bar, and a wide beer selection.Easily our best meal so far on our road trip between Saratoga Springs, Kingston and Montreal."

I came alone on a Sunday night and though I had a reservation, walk-ins were possible both at the bar and for tables(I saw a table of 4 walk in and be seated immediately. A girl who was also visiting from New York came in and sat next to me and she seemed sane enough so I asked if she wanted to spit our meal so we could try more things and she happily agreed. We ordered the Lamb Tartare, Asparagus, Crab Tart and the Tagliatelle with the deconstructed rhubarb pie for dessert(not what it was called but essentially what it was). Everything was truly great. I don't remember a meal I've enjoyed this much in such a long time. Prices were more than reasonable and we ended up spending $140 CAD total with two drinks each included. I don't think this place is hurting because it clearly receives attention from all over the country but this Yelp rating could not be further off. I'm an American and was sitting with another American and the service could not have been better. Go."

/user_details?userid=yE_1xqFxNkhQN8X-nL3cBA,Alice C.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,"What a highly unfortunate place. Two stars for sort of feeding my stomach on a night with horrendous weather where every other restaurant was closed in the area and for the nice bartender, but two stars for leaving me $80 poorer, still hungry, and confused as to how this dark, damp bladder of a place even exists.It was a good thing that I drank a giant beer before getting my food and managed to get slightly tipsy, because the tremendous wait time would otherwise have been unbearable. We got the beef pappardelle, which, while not inedible, could have maybe been enough food for a small cat with cancer. Our other entree, a supposed house special, was the pan-fried rabbit, which just tasted tough and dry. The whole thing was covered in two giant pieces of wet lettuce, obviously rinsed in the sink right before adorning our plate. Was this supposed to be the salad component of the dish, or was it supposed to serve as a canapy cover to hide the scabby rabbit leg? We will never know.The saddest part of this establishment may have been the fact that it tried to be an ""open air"" kitchen, where you could see the cooks prepare your meal. Now, why anyone would want to watch two young, dumpy looking American amateurs hold a conversation with each other while only half paying attention to the food that they were burning in the pan or groping out of plastic containers with their bare hands is beyond me, but I had a feeling that I knew how the food would taste before it even arrived in front of me.After we left this place, we went straight to a diner and ordered a burger and fries for $7. We tried not to think about how we could have instead eaten 11 orders of burgers and fries instead of our previous meal."

I made sure to call and book a table for my daughter and I. She is very well behaved and kept herself busy with toys so no, her behaviour did not affect my waiter's service.He was not friendly and when it was time to pay, I was still calculating his tip and he rushly asked if I needed any hangs back. To which I replied no... since I felt it needed a bit more $ since the food was amazing, as usual. I was a frequent customer and I am unfortunately no longer one because of that specific experience.** I used to sit at the bar and today was my first time at a table. So maybe the ambiance tends to differ a bit regarding where you chose to sit. Which I personally think it shouldn't but oh well. Farewell Maison Publique :( You used to be in my top 5 in town**"

I was also happy to venture back to my old neighbourhood East Plateau. Half the pleasure of going to this restaurant is it's great corner local neighbourhood restaurant vibe and super friendly staff. The Old fashioned was almost the best I've ever had (the best being my husband's old fashioned w brandies cherries & orange slice). The food & wine was also great. You order several sharing plates and the kitchen decides the order to serve them to you. Loved the crab tarte, beer salad and capellacio. I wasn't a big fan of the Welsh Rarebit but I may have been too full. But not full enough, since I gobbled down the amazing chocolate lava cake w cherries. A great plateau meal experience. Only recommendation would be to have more salad / veggie options. A solid 4 stars."

The beer options are not plentiful, but still good craft options.The foie gras mousse was decadent. I should have asked if my friend actually wanted it, instead myself being forced to scarf down two huge scoops of foie.The oysters with tiny pasta was a large and delicious portion.The fried rabbit was unfortunately very over salted. I like salty food, but every small bite of this dish needed a drink of water. Even as a leftover the next day, I tried my best to justify the dish, but it was just verging on inedible.I hate to let one dish completely ruin an experience. I'd give them another shot."

Although I loved this chef when he was at DNA, he seems to have become somewhat of an ass - maybe his association with Jamie Oliver is giving him a big head. Was impossible to get a smile out of our waiter/floor manager. He also pushed us an expensive bottle of wine when we were looking for 3 glasses of dessert wine - wine was not sold by the glass he told us after opening the bottle and serving us. We didn't really mind in the end, we paid the bill. But afterwards, when we mentioned that he could have warned us, he just ignored us at best. When we raised this issue with the chef/owner, his majesty had a foot on a chair looking down on us and defending his buddy. It was my bday dinner and we had spent a lot of money in this place. Will never return. Just too bad I have to give at least a star because this place doesn't deserve it"

Often, like Maison Publique, the location is just slightly enough off the beaten path to render it a ""find"". Sometimes En Route restaurants achieve these aims, while failing to please with a complete package of food and service. Maison Publique does better than most.The layout here is classic pub. The ceilings add to the feel that you are in a neighbourhood joint somewhere in Britain.The food is meant to be shared by those at the table. Some dishes (such as the Welsh ""Rarebit"") were unique, but not to my liking. The beef cheek salad was also creative, but short of delicious.The albacore tuna cru was a tasty tuna app that could easily be shared or reserved for one person. The highlight of the meal was the 65$ steak delmonico which was a large portion that could be a meal for two people by itself. The flavouring on the steak was perfect.Service here is good.

I've eaten here for brunch once and had an overpriced sandwich, which was ok, but I thought I'd give it another shot on a weekend night. When we went in and told the dudebro that we'd like to sit and have a drink at the bar (thinking we'd order a small dish to start off) he grunted at my manfriend, ""It's NOT a bar."" REALLY? You know, considering the fact that I live nearby and listen to their noisy customers out howling drunkenly on the street many a summer night, it seems ludicrous to slap me with that attitude. Pissing your neighbours off, particularly when you're a restaurant with a bar, in a residential neighbourhood, is probably not a good idea."

The beer selection would have pleased some off-island, cars-up-on-blocks kind of people, but I made do and ordered myself a pint of something ghetto. The food, here is why I am only giving the place 2 stars. No pub that I have heard of does tapas so I was already a bit put off: you're either ghetto or high end, not both.

Everything on the menu sounds delicious and reminds of good old homemade cooking.It might be worth noting that there are no menus. Instead, everything is written on a chalkboard near the counter. It might be neat if you happen to be seated nearby, but we were in another room, so we had to go stand in the aisle between other tables while making our choice. Not the end of the world obviously, but not the most practical. Our service was average at best. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our orders. And by the time the 5 of us received their food, some had long finished. It was delicious, but very expensive. Oh and did I mention this place was extremely hipster? Because it is. A lot.

I don't demand too much but we were there to eat and drink and left without ordering much because of this server.

He waved and began picking herbs from the small garden under a tree growing out of the sidewalk. Chef Derek Dammann came into view behind the bar and greeted me with such warmth I was convinced he recognized me from my frequent visits. I introduced him to my mom.The food here is fearlessly rich - they grill their Croque-monsieur in maple syrup. I find most restaurants are too timid with their hollandaise, but Maison Publique's smoked salmon benny has a bright, lemony flavour.

When the waiter brought the bill, we were informed that we could purchase a copy of the chef's new cookbook for $30 cash on our way out.   The bill came to about $100 which we had spent on dinners at several other places during the week, however, those dinners were much more substantial and enjoyable.  If not for our late lunch that day, we likely would have left hungry, and were very disappointed with our dining experience here.  Although this place enjoys some celebrity status, we did not get a good value at all, and wished we had eaten elsewhere."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There has been much anticipation for Jamie Oliver's 1st foray into the Montreal food scene with Maison Publique, the English pub style joint run by Derek Dammann, his local partner, former sous-chef and formerly of DNA restaurant in Old Montreal. While I had hoped to first experience their dinner service earlier during their opening week, the timing didn't work out. However, I was able to visit for Brunch on their first open Sunday. I was very exciting to see what exactly Derek and co. had in store.The restaurant is located in the heart of plateau Mont Royal in a relatively residential area. The bar dominates the decor and with good reason as it is absolutely beautiful. You also get a nice open view of the kitchen from both inside the restaurant (just outside of the frame to the left) and from the window outside the restaurant. The steady stream of alternative music added to a relaxed friendly and slightly hip vibe.No menus are handed to you here - everything is posted on a board for all to see. Our waitress kindly informed us of this fact and mentioned the few items she had gotten to try... They'd only had one service previous to our visit, so quite understandable. The menu is a nice mix of classic brunch items with some twists, some typical English breakfast items and more eclectic fare. To start off, I ordered the apple strudel. Nice and flaky with a delicious apple filling, it was a good start to the meal.Next up, I ordered the breakfast sandwich. A sausage patty covered with melted cheese, topped with a egg and maple syrup, all between the housemade English muffin. You are left with a very tasty and satisfying sandwich. The English muffin in particular was quite nice.My sister, on the other hand. ordered the pancakes with pear butter and smoked bacon. Very nice and fluffy pancakes, all perfectly cooked. The pear butter was a nice and subtle touch to the dish and the bacon had a great smokiness as you would expect.All in all, a very successful brunch and this was their first weekend. I only except things to get better and better. In general, good brunch places are hard to find so to see a new option enter the scene - especially in my neck of woods - is a wonderful thing. Everyone looking for a great brunch will be in for a great treat if they visit Maison Publique. I hope to have a review of their dinner options shortly - this experience has only made me more eager to come back for more.Cheers!"

We knew nothing about the Jamie Oliver connection 'til we got there. it's found right in the Plateau in a super residential area, just a hop skip and jump from Mont Royal Ave and around the corner from Papineau.My friend and I arrived early so we quickly order coffee and split a biscuit. First of all the coffee was awesome - they use 49th parallel beans and the biscuit was divine. Crispy on the outside and flaky and buttery on the outside. The bit that made it beyond the beyond amazing was the jam - rhubarb/strawberry. I understand it's pretty Quebecois and let me tell you pretty freaking delicious. A traditional bruncher, I went for pancakes and bacon. For 13 bucks you a get a stack of three pancakes and bacon. No maple syrup needed as it was already drizzled for you perfectly. Super filling brekkie as we were on our way to Osheaga and festival food, that said I didn't even finish my last pancake as I was pretty full from the biscuit. My two other friends got the same and loved them too and our other went even more traditional and went for bacon and eggs - also a winner.My only regret was not going for an early morning cocktail - they all looked delicious!

Let's start with the coffee. I've never felt such a lovely jolt from coffee. It was served in a lovely Montreal mug. There was 5 of us who decided to share several dishes. The menu changes regularly, but we got 7 dishes to share and there was not a dish that I'm not still dreaming about several hours and two meals later. My favorite was the pancakes and BLT. I know what your thinking. That's pretty normal bfast food. But, don't be fooled. I don't like sweet foods in the morning, but I was not sure how I could stop eating the pancakes and was a little annoyed I had to share this with others at the table. They were buttery and melted in your mouth. Also they were topped with bacon...mmmmm! The BLT was a delicious beefsteak tomato sliced and sandwiched between the layers was bacon and basil. The dish was then covered in a cream sauce. I will come back here next time I come to Montreal. I might even drive back just for this food:)"

Highlights were the giant oyster and the butterscotch dessert. Their house cider was also nice.Would definitely come back for another meal, and would be sure to order those items again."
/user_details?userid=zFDwOeIBWsE1DzXPHi2SYA,Julien D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Avoid. Initially, the menu sounds appetizing, in the trend of the up and coming québécois nouvelle cuisine. Oh were we disappointed. Overpriced and poor quality. The portions are ridiculously small. The food is surprisingly low grade. The atmosphere is nice but really doesn't offset the disappointments. This place almost qualifies as a scam. Head down mt royal avenue, for more and better options."
/user_details?userid=zvGdcjmzV7zFSCgwGNWPvg,D I.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"NEVER GOING BACK.When I made reservations for a group of 9 people, I was told that we would not be able to order a la carte and the staff recommended a family style menu at 70$ a head, not including alcohol or tip.  Once we got to the restaurant, waiter told us that group menus were 55$ a person. Already off to a bad start.If I can resume my experience in 3 statements:-HORRIBLE SERVICE: We were seated at 8:00 pm and only got our first entree around 9:00 pm. We actually waited 30 minutes between each service and the minute I complained about it the food started to magically appear out of the kitchen at a quicker pace. My opinion was that the waiter was trying to get us to spend more money on wine by slowing down the service. Thumbs down.-HORRIBLE AMBIANCE: Music was way too loud, temperature was insanely hot it was a sauna in there. A restaurant that small, packed with that many people and with that kind of ''reputation'' should be able to afford decent air conditioning for clients. I was literally drenched in sweat by the time our main course arrived. Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least.-AVERAGE FOOD: Food was ok but nothing to brag home about, and whoever gave this restaurant anything higher than a 3 star rating must be a tourist. Oh, and get this: the wine list only has CANADIAN WINES. And they're not cheap either. My cousin was visiting from Italy and we wanted to show him a good time on his first night in Montreal, and instead his and my whole family's experience at Maison Publique RUINED our evening. We were so glad to get the bill and get the hell out.Very disappointed and will go out of my way to tell people how horrible this restaurant is."

At first we thought maybe we would split our dishes between the two of us, unfortunately, I wasn't wearing my dress that Sunday morning to be able to legitimately eat something called ""quiche"" and feel like a man about it. Although, I did manage to bum a few bites though; manly bites... while growing chest hair, changing a flat tire and storing a pack of cigarettes in a stab wound.The quiche was filled with bacon and floating clouds of cheese that deflated at each bite in the creamy eggs that were next to custard. All bound together with a buttery crust whose flakes found the corners of our mouthes as little reminders of pastry pleasantries for later consumption... OMG, the quiche effect is taking its toll on my writing. HOCKEY, JACKHAMMERS and CHAINSAWS. The omelette pie was sided with a lightly dressed toss of watercress, parsley, shaved cucumbers and dill whose pepper notes cut through the richness."

/user_details?userid=Bveyuu-GqeQMf8ereY2I2g,Sabrina N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"What a disappointment. If i can give a restaurant zero stars, I would. The menu is confusing and the staff are not helpful. Upon asking more than once (we were a group of 8 and not one of us understood the menu), the answers we were given were vague and not helpful. We were unaware that the plate you chose had NOTHING else on it but what you ordered. For example: you ordered the pork chop, you got a giant pork chop. When I mean giant, I mean it's the size of a Flinstone piece of meat... but be aware that it's tough, fatty and either came over-cooked or raw. Then there was the tuna ""plate"". Keep in mind you ONLY get the tuna on your plate ... and it was the size of 3-4 sashimi slices. I'm italian; I gotta eat!! Was this an amuse-bouche? NOPE!! that was my meal. Thank god there was Mac and Cheese in my cupboard at home!!!I was utterly disappointed and the staff didn't seem to care to hear how disappointed we were. Considering that it'll cost you about 150$+ for two people (not including wine) I would really recommend taking that cash and going to Pinxto or Quartier General. The only good part about the whole night was that I was in good company."

In town for Grand Prix weekend and my group of 4 old friends wanted a quiet post race dinner after a weekend of louder fun...One of the group had tried Maison before and recommended it. It was a longish cab ride out from city center, but wow...very cool little bar/restaurant, quaint decor, very friendly staff and the food was fantastic. We tried several small plates to share and then had spicy ribs, which were one of the specials. We did a couple of desserts, several beers and/or cocktails each and got out for like $80 each. This is an awesome spot."
/user_details?userid=V0NyT2fKIs7pwFDSGqyCKQ,H L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"MP serves up consistently wonderful and creative food at a very reasonable price. We've eaten here too many times to count and have also held a private work party here (they made a massive feast for us. So good!). The staff are amazing---front-of-house man Felix is always a charming and welcoming host, and the owner/chef Derek keeps on cranking out unique, delicious grub and is usually on hand, supervising the crew and greeting guests. All in all, it's a cozy, home-away-from-home sorta place where you get to eat like a king. The smoked rabbit is excellent and, if you ever go and they have any sort of pasta on the menu, it's a must. The focus here is on seasonal, local, ethical produce. MP has cultivated relationships with all sorts of local suppliers who are proud of what they do, and you can taste the love."

/user_details?userid=aemsnsstESehmkTykbo38A,Marc S.,"Edinboro, PA",5 star rating,"To give this restaurant anything but five starts would be a sin.  We came in for dinner on a Sunday night and got the best two seats in the house:  right at the bar, looking into the open window to the kitchen.  Our server, the bartender, was fantastic.  He had an excellent personality, he was very attentive, and he was knowledgeable of the food and the wine served.  He recommended a great Cabernet Franc from Ontario, and convinced us to do the chef's tasting menu.  Our server seemed particularly tickled that we had absolutely no preferences of what to order, and left ourselves completely in the hands of the chef and himself.  From our first course (an amazing toast with the most luxurious whipped foie gras), I knew this place was a winner.  Course after course arrived at the table. Each one was perfectly on point.  There was only one dish that I did not fancy, it was a polish meatloaf-type dish, but I'm sure it was executed well, it is merely a personal preference.  Not only were the dishes selected amazing, but they were varied in texture, flavor, spice, and variety.  In addition to being delicious, the food was plentiful.  This is the first time I've had a tasting menu that we literally had to request the chef STOP sending out dishes.  One more bite of this amazing food and I would have been over the limit.  So, instead, I successfully negotiated a round of bourbon in lieu of dessert courses.  This was a win for us, as we couldn't imagine eating any more of the amazing offerings.  In summary, Maison Publique is a winner.  I travel excessively and always seek out the best-of-the-best in the culinary world.  This meal is clearly in the top five meals I've ever consumed. Well done, Miason Publique.  When my travels take me back to Montreal, you and I will meet again."

The Pot au Feu was a disgusting rendition of this classic dish, spongey, tasteless, and boring - a bland broth with 3 carrots and 3 potatoes floating in it.  And it's not cheap!  2 glasses of wine, a small app and a $20 entrée, ended up being $75 with tip!  Go for a drink at the bar and maybe an entrée, and you can enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy a nice dinner somewhere else!"
/user_details?userid=6CM7dhSe-loOi0oWm_UOQA,David U.,"Manchester, NH",5 star rating,"If you like chain restaurants and think you should have 2 sides with your meal this is not the place for you. They serve small plate style dishes here, everything is a la carte, it best to order to share. Order a few items at a time and they will filter out of the kitchen as they are finished. They will bring it all at once if you request it but frankly that's not the experience you should be after here. The menu is on the wall and changes frequently from the looks of it.Staff was very attentive and helpful as our French is non existent. It was explained that they really try to source from Quebec first, Canada second, and lastly elsewhere. Our evening started off with drinks I had a local beer and my wife a local cidre.  Our waiter explained the specials and the feast commenced. We started off with the stuffed oyster, Lebanese lamb tartare, and Asian style greens. The oyster arrived first and what an oyster, the size of my hand stuffed with onions, herbs, cheese, and more. Very rich and filling as we finished that tartare and greens arrived. The tartare was prepared excellently with middle eastern spice and a tzatziki style sauce. The greens were amazing garlic, chilies, soy sauce, and dry-salted cured pork. Being pleased with everything so far we pressed on wanting to savor every bite our last night out in Montreal. Me moved on to the fried rabbit and clam special. The rabbit was tender and tasty broken down into quarters and lightly fried. The clams came with an amazing broth garlic, chilis, and herbs. Skipping dessert was not an option having seen them go by to other diners as we ate. A seasonal rhubarb parfait was the perfect way to end my meal, my wife couldn't resist the pot de creme, a rich smooth chocolate custard. C'est fini!"

/user_details?userid=U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This is an excellent place.  I will list the goods and the bads, but the goods give them the 5 star, despite the other reviews I just read here on Yelp.  Here is what we had: 1.  BRUNCH FOR TWO:  Incredible array of meats.  The pork chop was amazing-the most delicious I have ever had-benefiting from a good brine that makes this chop flavorful and far more juicy than any pork chop I remember.  Boudin noir-homemade-was different than anything I have had in Montreal-it was light and delicate, with the pork fat having been cofited making it tender but adding a nice texture.  The mace flavor and onlions were noticeably large in the dish.  In fact, I think this was different than black pudding from England, german style blood sausage, Lunenbourg pudding from Nova Scotia, boudin from France or even Korean Sundae.  Here they make it with oats, which is not always done with the others I have listed. Bacon;  among the very best in MOntreal-very smoky and a good amount of salt from their brining. Reasonably lean compared to many bacons.  Montreal happens to be a great bacon town, if you know where to go.  Marrow-nice, but not that different than other marrows. Egg:  extremely well cooked over easy. Beans: very delicious-though I have no expertise here-they were definately different from the one's I have had.Sausage;  excellent homemade sausage.  Kid test-they loved it.  But this place is a little slow on the service to have a good kid experience, though we had a decent time of it today.  2.  TURNOVER:  Incredible, one of the most amazing, with a delicate pastry that was delicious and crisp. 3.  QUICHE:  The most unusual quiche with lots of creamy richness and some flavors I couldn't identify.  The bacon or ham was extremely smoky, giving this a very unusual and almost English flavoring. 4.  COFFEE:  Excellent Kenyan with a bit more character and acidity than most coffees.  The roast was deep and well balanced. I wanted to try the ""egg sandwich"" and the ""bison tongue sandwich which our neighbors raved about, but the meal was already over the top too much. CHEF:  Great chef formerly of DNA.  He belongs here much more-this is the appropriate setting for his skills.  Can't wait to try dinner here. WAITER:  Friendly and helpful, but always in a bit of a hurry to get away.  Also, there could be a little better explanation of what to expect from the different dishes on the menu (example;  the egg sandwich is a very small item.  Also, he encouraged us to order sides for the kids-quite unnecessary and pricey given the amount of food)BAD STUFF: Slow preparation-perhaps a bit slower than is necessary.  The cooks moved a bit slower than cooks tend to.  They are obviously intreseted in ""slow food"" style, but that doesn't mean moving slow.  But they were knowlegeable and dedicated nonetheless after talking to one of them. SLow delivery of simple things-it took quite some time to get some hot water. Balance-it is hard to balance a meal that is so much protein-and one could not expect it here. Price-Quite high for the items, but worth it nonetheless.  I would share the brunch for two amongst 5-6 people in the future and have a few sides.  That would be a reasonably priced meal.  We sepnt about 100 on 2 adults and 2 children which for brunch is quite pricey.  Menu:  handwritten and abbreviated-a bit too ""cool"".   How about handwritten with some explanation?  Has the photocopier been discovered in this part of MOntreal yet?  INFORMATION: Alternative meals;  They should be a great choice to try for dinner.  Brunch is only 2 days a week.  They were very crowded by 11:00 having opened their doors at 10:30I give this place a 5 star.  I would give it the same rating in Manhattan.  This is a keeper, but you never know in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=nj80i7CSAUWTzku-UIZwqg,Nat C.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,Cute farm to table joint. We were a group of four and orders a variety of items to share so we could taste a little of everything. The pastries we had to start were yummy. Especially what we were expecting to be regular banana bread but it was something so different we all loved it. I think everyone's favorite was the curry lamb potatoes and the sausage with lentils.

/user_details?userid=VJSEMw1FOgx2rB4Mlemv6Q,kyle d.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Excellent service, dinner and brunch.I like the vibe and feel of the place, and like the consistency of the service, and unpretentious attitude.  The food is for the most part very well prepared and creative - clearly the chef has a lot of passion.  There are some missteps. A fish soup I ordered was extremely salty I think on account of the fish having been salted and then added to an already seasoned broth. I had this soup twice because theoretically it should have been phenomenal and was hoping the first time was a mistake but it was salty both times. Chard that had been sautéed with garlic and vinegar didn't allow the vinegar to reduce so the chard was extremely vinegary and almost inedible. And probably most egregiously - the food is almost always overpriced.  A child sized platter of tagliatelle and meatballs I could have done at home for a quarter of the price (and better flavour), though I suppose it's nice to have someone churn out the fresh pasta for you. However - when the food is good it's incredible. Bluefin Tuna steak I ate recently was one of the best I have had. Lamb carpaccio was savoury and delicious. The butterscotch pot a creme dessert is possibly the most decadent and delicious dessert I've had in Montreal, and warrants a trip back just to eat it again.  I've only eaten brunch once, but I remember it being pretty darn delicious. I am here every so often, and will continue to come. Highly recommended."
