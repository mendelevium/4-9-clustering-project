/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I wish I lived closer to Byblos so I could have breakfast here more often.Silky-soft feta omelettes, rich and fragrant Turkish tea, an abundance of soft, warm bread and a jam selection with a variety of delicate, sweet, floral, and fruity flavours - a meal so appealing to the senses that I can almost taste it just by thinking about it.It's a cosy little place in an extremely gentrified neighbourhood (surrounded by the kind of shops that sell $100 plant pots and rugs, or expensive clothes for babies in a range of neutral tones) but Byblos itself feels authentic and down to earth.(You know a place is good when the review makes you extremely hungry.)Please, PLEASE order the feta omelette. It's not what an omelette might look like normally to you, but it's rich and buttery and salty and one of the most beautiful things I've ever eaten."

I went with my boyfriend who is Persian and though I thought he would declare something about how it's not ""authentic Persian"". We ordered Persian tea (chai) and the Persian pastries. To my surprise, my boyfriend said ""oh these are my favorite!"" It was all so delicious and a perfect dessert. Not too much, not too sweet (especially with the tea). A hidden gym."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",1 star rating,"I am really unsure how this place has four stars. I came in for a quick bite on a Friday evening and I regret that decision. If I could give less than one star I would. The soup of the day was a bean and potato soup , it tasted like dirty unsalted water. Their pita bread was tasteless and half of the pitas were very hard and the other half very soft. The main meal was a disaster , lamb & prune ""stew"" with spinach and rice. The lamb was dry , zero spices. The sauce also had zero seasoning just a very overpowering bitterness. I had two bites of my meal and put it aside. I waited for the inattentive disinterested waitress to come by and check on us so I could let her know about the food (which never happened, not even for a water refill). She did however look over from far a few times and avoided eye contact when we tried to get her attention. Bad service , bad food and in a basic bare bones atmosphere all for a very elevated price. Never coming here again. Zero customer service, zero food quality and zero ambience. What a disappointment."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I went there for brunch and had the shakshuka with minced meat. For those of you wondering what a shakshuka is... basically it's eggs sunny side up prepared in a delicious tomato sauce and well spiced. I have had  shakshuka at other restaurant and can say this one is pretty legit. I never had it with minced meat and really liked it. I would recommend this dish to anyone who wants to try something more exotic than pancakes and basic eggs and omelettes :-)As for the restaurant itself it is really cozy and they offer a great selection which makes it hard to make a choice. I will definitely go back for dinner and try their other items.
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My friend and I visited Byblos on a cool Wednesday evening and the place was relatively quiet based on what I've read from other reviews- though definitely not dead for a standard weekday night. The service was relatively attentive although, as others have noted, they didn't seem impressed with my ignorance of the menu.For a shared and tasty appetizer plate, one pot of tea, two hot pockets and a pudding each we walked away from the resto having each spent $30. Ouch. I will say that the flavours and textures experienced throughout the meal were rather special, despite everything.Moral of story when visiting Byblos: get the table d'hôte or go for breakfast (it seems?)-otherwise the portions are small and kind of expensive. I'd also go, when you can, with the Dizzy meal- that looked like way more fun."

/user_details?userid=myBGjHJ9EhE9pyeodWw2Mg,Nuna C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Let's jump right into it, I'm not Persian but I am no idiot either.  Byblos makes yummy dishes that allow us to experience textures, spices and flavors that you commonly wouldn't otherwise.  First, you want to get there early enough so you don't have to wait.  Unless, of course, you don't mind that part, like me.  Second, sit near the windows on a summer day.  Lastly, get a spread of items.  Don't do the American style of one HUGE dish of one item but rather get the small plates of sides/mezzes and share them.  It's likely that you haven't tried any one of them before.  Sip tea, eat soft breads with tantalizing marmalades, chat, laugh, eat slow and leave wanting to keep strolling around the neighborhood."
/user_details?userid=5KibiQBLrIKGIc6VIYxhaw,Stacey C.,"Fairfax, CA",5 star rating,We had a very enjoyable brunch with our baby and toddler at 9am on a Sunday morning. There was a baby or toddler at every table that they seated between 9 and 10 and the waitress (who I think may have been the owner) was just great with each family. She made sure all the littles were comfortable and happy. There's a great stash of toys you can bring to your table to keep the kids entertained too. My son was in heaven. I haven't even mentioned the food yet! We had a traditional Persian breakfast with halva and sweet breads and rose petal jam. It was a great way to start our day.

/user_details?userid=GqD_4YYmGcGdmAIdFu48Uw,Véronique N.,"Sainte-Adèle, Canada",2 star rating,"I did not like the brunch; the plate was stricly made of mashed eggs with feta. No fruits or sides. Only some dried bread that didn't feel fresh. Its quite disappointing, en also expensive for what you get. The tea was good though."
/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When the elegant Persian woman approached the table to ask what we would like for brunch, her beautifully aged face did not hold back a single expression of her true feelings for our silly questions. For what some may perceive as attitude was in fact, pure glorious charm. The authenticity of Byblos runs through the hands of the cooks to your plate, as a gift to you. For brunch, a spread of jellies was suggested to share with the table. Sharing is encouraged with all plates so get ready to grab and dip, don't be shy. The jellies ranged in flavour from rose to orange and cardamom to date. They're more drippy than traditional British or French jams you might have in mind. Be open.The feta omelette was heralded by the group so if you're a first timer or haven't adventurered that way, might I suggest it. Cactus grape juice, oh baby yes. Go for it."
/user_details?userid=jXHrSe9-iqyUa0sQGQtAOQ,Victoria I.,"North Hollywood, CA",4 star rating,"A great option off Laurier with unique eats. Brunch can get really busy, and service is often slow or can even forget you at times. Be assertive, and you will have an incredible meal. When in doubt, always order the house-made and seasonal jams. The feta omelette is not what you're used to, but absolutely delicious. It's also a popular place for families with young kids, but be prepared for a leisurely meal."

/user_details?userid=zBOwLUxKSZ6oyVNTYM08hA,Clara L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Good, simple brunch in a sunny and cozy restaurant.My boyfriend and I came here two days ago on Saturday at noon on a recommendation from a friend from Montreal. It wasn't our first choice, but by the end of our meal we were glad we came here.After a 10 minute wait, we were seated and given some English menus, which was nice since we were coming from out of town and didn't know much French. The food on the menu looked really simple - sweet bread, eggs, omelettes, jam... But as I've often heard, a good meal doesn't have to be complicated, and that rings absolutely true for the food we had here. The feta cheese, nuts, and fresh herbs paired really nicely with the different breads they served on the side. The feta omelette that others have written about previously is also really unique and delicious. We also enjoyed the Iranian tea that came in individual teapots. For two, the bill came to just under $25.We came in only for a quick breakfast before doing some sightseeing, but Byblos does seem like a place to read, relax, or have long conversations with friends. The restaurant was bright and nicely decorated with blankets over the benches, plants near the windows, and books and artwork on the walls. Service was nothing special, but we'd definitely come again for a relaxing meal."

The menu is quite extensive so watch out if you have decision-making issues like me who just ended up ordering a bit of everything! I love their yogourt dips (especially the eggplant one) and their sweet bread and hummus- everything on the menu is a hit. Cafe-like atmosphere with lots of tables and room, very family friendly. Great tea selection. Will be back soon!"
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This petit café has been there for so long... And there are good reasons for this. I went again yesterday and as I was eating my feta with fresh herbs, halva, fresh bread, and rose petal-pistachio home-made jam, I felt I had a foot in the Middle East. The decor certainly helps to give this impression! It's quite popular but although we were third in line, we waited for less than 10 minutes and had a spot for the stroller as well (it was about 12:30pm on a Sunday). Speaking about kids: they are welcome there, high chairs are available as well as toys. Usually I have the feta omelette breakfast (delicious) but everything else I have tried is good too."
/user_details?userid=9TT_mBR1xKn5I62vg1yu7w,Athena C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4 star rating,"Located on a quiet block in Montreal, Byblos has plenty of local business. We walked into this spacious, family-owned restaurant only to be greeted by friendly host. Then, the owner himself came out to give us a rundown of the menu with passion and of course, thick Persian accent. He recommended we ordered the set menu for 4, which includes appetizers (bread and 4 dips), 4 entrees and 4 kinds of desserts. We accepted without protest. The dips are outstanding with flavors including yogurt with cucumber, beans, garlic and another meaty one. They go perfectly with the warm house pita bread. For entree, we got chicken, lamb and beef and they all come with different style of rice. I love lamb the most because the rice is the tastiest but also the lamb is cooked to tender and flavorful. We ended with 4 types of puddings and sorbet in a martini glass. I really enjoy the cucumber sorbet because it is truly refreshing and unique. The restaurant is lovely with Persian arts on the wall and you don't feel rushed or too loud dining inside. I enjoy the food and company here and would recommend to tourists and locals alike."

/user_details?userid=FCtJ0J9ujf7qf1yMxSYPrA,Rebecca W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my top 3 breakfast/brunch spots in the city, this place has the most original and delicious omelettes I've ever had and it's pretty inside too with big windows and middle-eastern art everywhere. My boyfriend and I order this exact thing every time we go: 1 feta & dill omelette, 1 date omelette with pastries and sesame buns, and an order of the feta, nuts & fine herbs with pita and rosewater jam.Kapow! So good.The only things that I do not love about this place are: a) that's it's a little tough to get to by metro and the parking situation is terrible, and b) the service is never great. The servers tend to be really busy and on the verge of grumpy but the food is so good that I still give it a 4 on 5."
/user_details?userid=VhpNKItBRemhBCBr2Jq5Zw,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had a delightful breakfast there. I ordered the feta omelette, which is made with plenty of feta (but not overpowering) with a great saltiness, garnished with dill. It came with pita and sesame and poppy seed bread and included a beverage. I had Iranian tea and sweetened it with cubed sugar.They make many delicious varieties of jam, including rose petal. There were 5 of us so we were able to try 5 different types. Overall, fine service and nice vibe. We went at 10am and there was space. By 11:30, there was a long lineup."
/user_details?userid=ZzSQfy8928uACz2loRJYmg,Gillian C.,"Old Chatham, NY",2 star rating,"After walking by this cafe a number of times and then reading so many great reviews on here, I made an in-person reservation for my birthday dinner. I love Persian food, and it had been years since I'd been to a Persian restaurant. I loved the decor and thought this would be a great place to enjoy my birthday. Sadly, it didn't deliver.For one thing, the service was awful. The server pretty much ignored us, and the movement from course to course was so slow we wound up there for two and a half hours. That's a long time to be sitting in a restaurant if they aren't keeping you busy with multiple courses. The server offered only basic descriptions of the dishes available and wasn't able to answer my questions about how dishes were prepared. She kept saying ""I don't know,"" but she never offered to go to the kitchen and find out. I wasn't sure if it was simply that she didn't know the English words for some foods, but she knew that my companion spoke fluent French--as she chose to speak with him only in French-- and didn't attempt to answer my questions with his help either, so her inability to describe the food remains a mystery--and a shortcoming-- to me.We ordered an appetizer and a salad to start. The salad--red cabbage and apples in a vinaigrette--was really more like a coleslaw. Uninteresting and just okay. The eggplant appetizer, a kind of pate similar to baba ghanouj in texture but flavored with pomegranate juice, was delicious, the standout of the meal as far as I'm concerned.My companion's chicken entree was okay, with a nice sauce, but my lamb stew--which didn't come with any rice, though the menu had seemed to imply that all entrees did-- was flavorless and the lamb, tough. This stew didn't have any seasoning that said ""Persian"" to me. It was cooked in a sauce with a tomato base and some vegetables like carrots and potatoes. I didn't taste any spices, not even salt. I stole some of my companion's extra sauce that had come on the side with his chicken and poured it over, just so I could enjoy some flavor; at least that sauce was flavorful and delivered on its Persian roots.The fruit compote dessert was nice. The tiny apricots--about the size of gooseberries--were infused in a rosewater sugar syrup. It would have been nice if the pits had been removed, but the fruits were served whole and were nevertheless enjoyable.Overall, I was very disappointed, as I had looked forward to a special birthday meal. I don't see the cause for all of the high praise for this place here on Yelp, and I surely won't be back during the remainder of my monthlong stay in Montreal."

We were not dissapointed. Creamy, salty and delicious. Served with and assortment of breads (the sweet one is delicious!), homemade jams and Iranian tea (black tea with cardamom), it was the perfect meal for a chilly winter morning. This is a popular meeting spot for young moms and babies. Their sweet faces delighted us older women. We will definitely return to try many other dishes."

I had a rice and meat dish that was tender and moist. I would recommend forgoing the $20 entree-main-tea option and just sticking with the main. Recommend the specials.

Half star off because I would have preferred some cheaper tea/dessert options."
/user_details?userid=bCNB7d_uTCoGcGA5liU5bA,Mark T.,"Portland, OR",2 star rating,"Such a disappointing dining experience.  Pleasant waitstaff and mellow vibe, but dull/bland/uncreative interpretations of otherwise delicious-sounding menu items.  For example, a flatbread sandwich listed as coming on ""pain oriental"" or ""oriental flatbread"" came on a tasteless whole wheat tortilla.  I was excited that they'd be whipping something fresh and interesting out of the oven, but instead, the breads, including the pita that accompany the meal, are nothing you couldn't find at any neighborhood grocery store.The spinach roll was bland and the texture rather mushy.The eggplant, spinach and garbanzo dips were each very underwhelming.Definitely won't be returning."

/user_details?userid=W-l8Y9FnJt8zv1C7d3H5rQ,Mahmood Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After Safran, in Nice (France) this is my second favorite Iranian restaurant outside Iran. Of course I still prefer my mom's dishes when it comes to hedonistic pleasures, but Byblos is not only about eating. You have to understand that Byblos is a concept restaurant: restaurants in Persian culture are strictly in a diners style. We go there to eat, which is fine... But, one goes to Byblos to meet friends, have a nice conversation in a cozy environment over a pot of finely brewed tea, pick up a book about Middle East and leaf through it, even work, and have some Mezze-like or snack-like light/raw meal and eventually, if one still feels lacking on sensorial pleasures, goes for a main dish. The meals are by no means the most authentic, most delicious, or most copious Persian dishes you can get for your money in Montreal, but they taste homemade and real. I agree with the other commentator that they use more natural and less processed ingredients. I give four stars over five to their food, but overal I love the experience, whether it is for a get-together, or a date, or just having a cup of tea while checking emails. By the way, the patron is quite friendly and keeps checking on the tables to see if they miss anything, just like a Persian host."
/user_details?userid=K-Q-clbcdpKwNmAKPm4DdA,Pete D.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,Loved the feta omelette! It has a creamy texture with lots of dill. Wifey got the tomato omelette and it was also excellent. The omelette is more like traditional scrambled eggs than the western style fold over omelette with items in the middle as popular in the US.  We had great seat next to the open window on a beautiful fall day.  The service was very good. Prices are reasonable. Located in a charming Montreal neighborhood.

/user_details?userid=s9NmTncEz-Hi66M2v0-ZPA,Christine R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been there only for breakfast. They serve you what they call Feta omelet: a secret mixture of, well, feta, eggs, butter and dill. Sounds ramdom, but tastes like no eggs you've ever had before.You can also choose to go with the date omelet, or the oriental one. If you order the ""combo"", you'll get a coffee, homemade bread and homemade jam (the waitress will overwhelm you with her rose-carrot-ginger-orange-pistachio-lime - and it goes on...-  list of possible flavors) for about 9$. A deal.Very exotic, all of it served in a beautiful place, all of wood, with windows wide open during the Summer. The only downer: the service is kinda slow... It's usually because the owner and her daughter are fighting about something, which is actually worth the wait.Plus, the neighborhood is great: young and familial, with cheese and bread shops, organic and clothes stores. Everything you think Montreal should be!Keep your eye out for all the Québec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night. Like our very Corey Hart."

The Feta omelette is a standout, creamy and flavorful and prepared like no other omellete that you may be  accustomed. The many other items that we tried were all tasty and ""exotic"",but, I must say nothing to write home about.The portions were plentiful lots of bread to fill up on and reasonably priced.

The location is several blocks from a metro in a peaceful area filled with old trees and young professionals. The service was a bit slow, but it's a lovely place to linger if you have the time. The cafe has a menu of daily specials and regular sides and appetizers. The servings are small, and a soup and salad might be delicious but they won't be filling. I loved the tomato barley soup and grilled eggplant salad I ordered - they were flavorful and light - but I would have loved more hearty veg options. A meal of many sides would have surely been both delicious and filling had I wanted to spend a more significant chunk of change. There are a lot of vegetarian sides and omelettes, but all of the main dishes of the day had meat. There are a number of vegan sides and appetizers too, including what I ordered, but most of the veg options are heavy on yogurt and eggs."
