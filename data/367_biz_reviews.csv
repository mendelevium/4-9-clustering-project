The restaurant has a cute original décor inside and a nice terrace outside.I was pleased that they have my favorite Eggs Benedict with salmon. The service is good and the food is great. The only downside is that the coffee is not included with your brunch and you have to pay for coffee in addition to your meal.The portions are average, my Benedicts came with oven roasted potatoes (not super generous on potatoes) and some fruit. Nevertheless, the eggs and the sauce were up to my standards.I'd say this is a nice new discovery I made and I would definitely go back there again for brunch."
