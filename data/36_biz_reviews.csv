/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It was high time to update this review, particularly as Robin des Bois has stepped up their game throughout the pandemic. It's been years since I initially visited for a work party and unfortunately I haven't been back to the restaurant itself since. Honestly, this is for no other reason than forgetfulness and distance from neighbourhood. Recently Robin des Bois came back into my purview while I was looking for Christmas dinner delivery options: a lot of the Christmas meals didn't appeal to me or didn't offer vegan options for my partner. Stumbling upon Robin des Bois' delivery service was a total blessing: we were able to get fancy dinner fare for both the omnivore and the vegan in the house. As with my first experience with them, the quality of the food was terrific and the price point was equally amazing. For $100 we were able to get a great bottle of orange wine, delicious bacon, homemade tempeh, their famous dahl soup, a butternut squash focaccia, two sous vide bavettes and a duck rillette. A total steal and it was delivered to my door! I'm really looking forward to being able to try this spot in person again, but in the meantime I'll be indulging at home."

All I knew before we got there was that all personnel working there except the chef are volonteers. As well all the profits arr turn back into the community. Suprisingly, their menue during the Covid was quite extensive. The food was great, their wine selection is good and service is super. I will definitly return."
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to robin des bois on a fri night with a group of friends. It wasn't quite a 4 star ""restaurant"", but it was a 4 star experience. The restaurant is quite spacious w/ high ceilings and all the different colorful upholstery give the ambient a playful uplifting twist.The service was one of the most memorable components of the night for me. The waitresses were actually a group of friends who had volunteered that night as a way to celebrate the birthday of one of them. It was the 1st time most of them were trying this experience/serving in a restaurant and so our interactions with them were uncharacteristic and fun in new unexpected ways - making dinner a pleasant and successful experience was a shared team effort :)Unfortunately, we had to wait for about 40 minutes before our food was served. So it helped that we were not starving/in a rush. I got the beef bavette which came w/ fries and a smallish salad. The fries were ok, but the beef was juicy, flavorful and very enjoyable. The rest of us ordered sanwiches and the mountain w/ duck confit. The duck confit was nice but the sandwiches were particularly interesting as the meat was mixed with fresh herbs that gave the sandwich a fresh aromatic character. I'm not a fan of lime flavoured desserts/pastries. But we democratically decided to share the coconut milk rice pudding with mango and lime coulis for dessert!  And now I have learned that once in a blue moon there can be pleasant exceptions: I loved it! The main ingredient of the relatively thin coulis  layer  was soft sweet mango perfectly complemented by hints of light fresh citrusy flavor of lime finished w/  toasted almond slices! Hallelujah! Good dessert is always a blessing!As a not-for-profit organization, along with tasty  food and the volunteer opportunities they enable, they have created a fun charming setting. I would definitely go back, for a casual fun dinner w/ friends or, to experience what it's like to work at a restaurant w/ my friends ;D"

Unfortunately, they didn't have many options to accommodate. After we were done with our meal, we waited 35 minutes for the dessert to come. I found that the regular staff and manager were taking it very easy, resting not being very helpful during lunch rush hour while the volunteers were running around and not well trained to provide service. It was kind of sad and frustrating. The volunteer that served us was very nice, but for the price that are charging, management needs to step up and be more hands on."
/user_details?userid=OvNii0hbKDO1-aSEamFBgA,Emilie D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was good but not over the time. We were three people and they messed up all of our orders; which was not a 'turn off'; it was fixed and they were very nice and apologetic about it, but it did feel it lacks professionalism.The food, again, is 'ok', but nothing to rave about. Prices are OK.We were also sitting at an awkward table, kind of in the way.The staff were also -- how to say? -- at times, too 'casual'. Not with us, but among themselves, and close to us (we could hear them, laughing and such).Maybe will go again, but will try other things first. I do recommend going at least one, too; it may become your place in other words; don't hold it to my words. I do think it's worth trying out."

Your wallet feels good, your belly feels good. What more could you ask?!"
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was at Robin des Bois for a special event. I was extremely impressed with their ability to manage a large table of +10 people! Many dishes are great for sharing (see photos) and will cater to a variety of budgets! I loved the mango chicken with the feta and their Dahl soup (which has been served there for over 11 years!) We got little chocolate cakes for dessert which were very rich in flavor! The mousse frosting on top was delicious! As a large side note, this restaurant reinvests a majority of their profits in local non profits such as Santropol Roulant. Many workers here are volunteers, working alongside regular staffers. Check out their website to find out about volunteering."

/user_details?userid=z3fTsodnVjP6uPwYWO5cRA,Rachel F.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,Great menu. I had the salmon tartare and the poutine. It was fresh and flavorful. The staff were friendly and I thought the pricing was on par for the size of the dishes. The menu also has a lot of gluten free options and everything felt healthy with a good mix of light fare and indulgences.

And let me say that it did not disappoint. The restaurant is very inviting; friendly staff with open space and fun eclectic fabrics decorating the dining chairs. I ordered small salmon tartare, arugula salad and french fries, and savored every bite!  Salmon tartare came with capers which was a great mix.  I would order this combination again."
/user_details?userid=cOKI2Dd0C_B3qu4pLr7EbQ,David M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"This was an amazing dining experience.  Robin des Bois is French for Robin Hood - and this restaurant gives back its profits to charities in the community. While there are paid staff - much of their kitchen help and waitstaff are volunteers. The space is large and interesting. The noise level is very reasonable. And the food and service is outstanding. We started with a very fresh citrus salad. For mains we had ""The Mountain"" with salmon and a duck confit sandwich with perfect fries. All were well prepared and tasty. The portions were so huge that we unfortunately had no room for dessert. Bet they were great too. We loved the concept of the restaurant giving back to the community, and we loved the food as well."

They donate all profits to youth charities and the waiters are all volunteers. The concept is extraordinary, love it!When I arrived at the door, they gave me a food sample and it was good. I ordered three small dishes that they call petits faims (small hungers), a cup of curry soup (literally a cup!!!), a small salmon tartar and a vegan chili, the price is quite reasonable and I was really full after taking the three little dishes. I like the service very much since the waiter is super nice and helpful. There was also live music performance, the place is really full of good vibes!"

/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A restaurant with a great cause and great food. This is a non-profit with volunteer staff, quite the unique concept in Montreal. Their menu is very vegetarian/vegan friendly, and very customizable. It's basically ""Build-Your-Own"": you pick a base (salad, rice, soba noodles) and add your protein (grilled octopus, chicken, liver, salmon...). There's also a more ""classical"" part of the menu (with salmon tartare, steak, poutine, etc) and an eclectic choice of sides (we got a delicious okonomiyaki!). The portions are huge (believe me, I took home half my plate!), and the prices are very reasonable. Also: we asked for sangria even though it was not on the drinks menu and boy did they deliver! Most generous sangria I've had in Montreal so far, I'd say!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I have to rant and rave for a few minutes, because this place is truly special! So, Robin des Bois, meaning Robin of the Woods, refers to Robin Hood - the concept behind this restaurant is 'take from the rich to give to the poor', meaning all proceeds go to support four different local charities in Montreal. Even if you're not rich, you will feel it after experiencing this fantastic restaurant-with-a-heart. I came to Robin des Bois as a volunteer, not a patron (though I will definitely go back to eat the food). In fact, all of the wait staff are volunteers from the community who sign up for a certain number of tables to wait on, and then go out and do their best. To be honest, I had never in my life worked a table before my first night here, but all of the staff are so kind and helpful, ESPECIALLY the very charming manager, Luc, that I found my feet soon enough and helped out wherever I could. I don't speak French very well so I was a little bit shy with people, but everyone was super understanding and gracious. A lot of the wait staff, however, are people who come back to volunteer regularly (because it's so much fun) and they really know their stuff. The FOOD LOOKED AMAZING and I wished I was eating every single dish that I delivered. OMG. It's fine dining, my friends. And, the desserts! The volunteer wait staff and kitchen staff were well fed, too, though! Everybody got delicious nacho soup - the best I've ever had, with fresh chunks of avocado, cilantro, toasty chip bits - nom nom! Not only is the food exceptional, but at the front of the restaurant is a selection of local preserves made entirely by volunteers and all from ingredients from local small farms or rooftop gardens! Pickles till the cows come home. If you're a ""people before profits"" kind of person, this is the best place to put your money where your mouth is, literally! The interior is beautiful, like a deluxe, somewhat aged theatre with a lovely piano and warm décor. There are plenty of romantic nooks to dine with your favourite person, or whole sections for large parties. I'm really hoping we can have a Yelp Elite event here sometime!"

The server was attentive and quickly brought a high chair for my little one. The food was delicious. My little one got the Shepard's pie and liked it. My partner got the River and said it was a little spicy and very good. I got the Mountain and would get it again! The menu is well labeled for vegetarians, vegans and gluten free folks. The food came out in a timely manner. I love the diverse menu and the fact the money goes to charity."

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for dinner last night with my partner and absolutely LOVED everything about this cozy restaurant. They have a retro- diner kind of vibe that is a bit upscale. Tables for large groups as well as small. A stage for music which they have on most weekends and delicious food. We order the dahl soup to start which was reasonably priced ($4 for a bowl to share for two people) and then the vegetarian chili, poutine, and mountain plate with grilled tofu. The tofu was our favorite part, sweet and firm (I hate soft tofu). The restaurant Is run by volunteers and profits go to charity so you feel good about eating here too! The night we visited, there was a family, including a dapper 10 year old boy in vest and bow tie that we're volunteering. I know we'll definitely be back to eat and perhaps even volunteer."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Located on Saint Laurent Robin Des Bois is staffed almost entirely by volunteers and the proceeds go to local charities.  They also try to put an emphasis on using local ingredients which is always a huge plus if you ask me.  The decor is a little on the dated side but the service is great and the concept is fantastic.I started with a corn and bacon soup which was quite disappointing.  I was expecting a chowder-like soup (something thick and creamy) but this was not like that.  It was quite runny actually.  I followed it up with a braised pork roast with spetzl that more than made up for the soup though.  It was moist and fell apart with my fork.  I finished it off with a lime meringue pie which was quite balanced in flavour.  The lime didn't overpower everything but the pie wasn't overly sweet.The prices are very reasonable here and are what you'd expect for the location.  In fact the dessert menu was quite cheap compared to a lot of restaurants that I've been to as of late.  Definitely hit this place up if you can.

You think of all the places you might want to go but realize they're probably pretty booked and you didn't make any reservations. Hm. What does Yelp say? Yeah, been there, it's okay. Umm that place looks nice but way too expensive. What's this? Robin des Bois? Volunteer staff? Proceeds go to charity? Nice looking menu items? What the heck, let's try this spot. Call to make reservations just to be on the safe side. Get there and realize no reservations needed this particular night. What a charming place. Inviting, cute decor, customized chairs, a piano on the stage... And we haven't even looked at the menu yet! Let's see here... grilled octopus confit? Umm yes please. Creamy mashed potatoes? Roasted carrots parsnips and beets? Green beans cooked to perfection? What kind of magic did they do with these shallots? A mashup of all the best, buttery, comforting things to put in my belly. And I can get a glass of whisky? I'm overwhelmed. I hope they don't offer dessert. Oh, okay, I'll get that creme glacee avec fraise et meringue. Siiiigh. Splurging so much never made my wallet feel so good. And compared to other places in town, this was a bargain! Looking forward to coming back SOON."

/user_details?userid=OV0hE14sxg7VnAmePrmCnQ,Tj I.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",5 star rating,"We came here on a Monday night for dinner and we were welcomed warmly to a fun environment. To point out, we didn't know it going into the restaurant but everyone who served us was a volunteer (wearing en elf hat-which was super cute!) and all the proceeds go to a charity. We thought that was a very neat idea and created a fun atmosphere. We ordered the ""Chinese buffet"" for 2; which was plenty. It included coconut curry soup appetizer-sweet and spicy with a hint of citrus-delicious and great on a cold winter night! It also came with 3 main dishes- pan fried tofu with mushroom rice, Asian salad and saba noodles with octopus- they were all delicious and complemented each other.  All this was $44 CAD (and we brought leftovers home) We also got cappuccino and brownies to share for desert. Once again Robin Des Bois didn't disappoint. Overall if you're looking for a really good food and fun atmosphere for a reasonable price, we would definitely recommend checking this place out!"

The staff of volunteers is enthusiastic about what they're doing, which is wonderful to see. I had the burger, which I highly recommend, with their arugula salad as an entree which was plenty filling but I still found space for one of their delicious desserts. Even better, after that I went to their ""salle de défoulement"", where for 2$, you can write something on a plate and throw it against a wall. The proceeds go to charity and it's lots of fun. Overall, a great place that I highly recommend."

/user_details?userid=_S7P6eKBi0Lm-BLXut6HcQ,Bryan B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Firstly, Robin des bois is a great concept. All profits go to local charities and most of the waitstaff and kitchen staff are volunteers. My mom came into town the other night and we were looking for a good place to go for dinner. Happened to be in the area, and we decided to try out RDB to see how good the new chef is. Both of us were blown away. The atmosphere in the restaurant is what it's always been, cute, a little eclectic, reminds you a little of the former Cafe Esperanza on St Laurent (now, cafe Caigibi). Despite being volunteers, the service from these waiters was better than a good amount of service I've experienced from paid employees in restaurants lately. Enough about atmosphere and service though; the food! We both started with their green house salad and it bode very well for the rest of the meal. Fresh baby arugula, chopped and roasted hazelnuts, parmesan shavings and a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. Now I know, salad is salad, but getting that balance just right is tough and this place does it very well. We also had their black olive polenta fries. These were delicious too, little crispy sticks of polenta with bits of black olive served with a rosemary mayo for dipping. And then our mains arrived; my mother had their gnocchi with buttnernut squash puree (homemade, boiled then gently pan fried for a little bit of crispyness) while I had the ""pieuvre confite"". My mother (who is notoriously difficult in restaurants) loved her meal. The gnocchi were little clouds of heaven served atop a nice, bright squash puree which was perfectly seasoned.  What blew my mind though was the octopus. True to its name, the pieces of octopus were slow-cooked in fat for a few hours and served with a tortilla española and a homemade roasted tomato salsa. The octopus had the texture of lobster. I ve never had anything quite like it. The fattyness was balanced out by the bright acidity of the tomato salsa and the spanish omlette rounded everything out quite well. Finally for dessert we split a cognac-espresso panna cotta with speculoos crumbs. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal. Even more incredible was the price. Usually for food this good, I d be willing to pay $100 pp and up. At  $20-30 per person (before drinks) RDB is some of the greatest bang for your buck in Montreal dining."

Instead it looked seasoned but I could not get any taste out of it. The same applied with the potatoes, no taste either :(Don't understand why the waiter called this his favorite dish.My friend was explaining to me that this was one of the best cuisines in town and it is volunteer ran. All the profits are donated to charity. Which makes it hard for me to give this place a bad review.The wine and beer selection was decent.I'd recommend trying the flank steak, that didn't look too bad but be wary you might need to bring your own spices and seasoning!"

Great causes aside, their white bean, bacon, and vegetable soup had just the perfect amount of seasoning to bring out the natural flavors of all the vegetables without having any single element overpower the entire dish. For my main course, I had the Cajun fish fillet w/ squash and legumes, which was delicious even if the Cajun spicing on the fish was slightly overpowered. Next time you're in Montreal, you would do well to see out this pro-bono establishment."

Both experiences impressed me, and it takes different traits to impress lovebirds/parents. I consistently recommend this place to friends. The staff is warm and welcoming. There's a quirky vibe to the service. It's formal, but not overly stilted (the server asked my parents where they were from, recommended favorite dishes from experience). The decor is equally quirky with a whimsical charm that's inviting, but still date-night. I'm glad they take reservations, because it has really filled up by about 8pm both times I've been there. Also, our food took a while to arrive both times (45min+) but if you don't mind a loud-ish room, it's comfortable for conversation with a full bar. The food meets at the intersection of delicious and affordable. The Brussels sprout salad with Parmesan and nuts was so good I didn't want to share - and only $5. The entrees were very different from each other and each tasty. My husband's dish (Duck Duo) ""won"" because it was the most decadent, but I also enjoyed my risotto. This place is an excellent destination for out of town guests. Its location makes it a nice end to a Plateau stroll."

I loved the decor, which I found simple yet stylish, and the service was wonderful. It made me wish paid service could be as good.As for the food, our party of 6 tried the dal (perfectly balanced spices), the watermelon and halloumi (again a wonderful balance), the fries (delicious lemony mayo), and the courgette fritter (made the least impression on me), en entrée. For the main course, we had grain-fed chicken (succulent), bavette (perfectly cooked), wild mushroom risotto (very creamy), mussels with fennel (delicately flavoured) and the lamb tian (melted in the mouth). Definitely recommend it!"

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Alright, I didn't try the food but I hear there's a new chef. The four stars are for the kindly concept of a non-profit restaurant with volunteers who get to learn about restaurant cooking while supporting good projects; and for the stiff drinks we had there; and for the beautiful wooden stage and piano and performances by the band and string section last night at the album launch we attended. Robin des Bois is hosting lots of shows these days and it's really a great space for some cozy, heart-warming live music and dining."
/user_details?userid=0mYluH3de3N8yXfF5IpptQ,David W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a gem for the quality of the food and the facts profits go to the community.  The wait staff are volunteers and the place had a great vibe.  The night my GF and I were there a lawyer was serving us.  As for the food, excellent.  Braised lamb possibly the best I ever tasted $20.  Red lentil soup to start also very good, it was a bargain at around $4.  Key line and meringue tart to finish was also a total deal at around $5.  My GF said the Cesar salad with smoked trout was the best she ever had.To summarize this review... meal for 2 was under $90 with a 20% tip including 1 glass of red wine at $9.  Any shortcomings are not worth mentioning; hence giving ""Robin hood"" the full 5 stars.  Moreover, I will definitely go back when I return to beautiful Montreal.  This was the highlight dining experience of our trip to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=5TmpPrfJMMLDZ13k01GeIw,Tamara M.,"Winnetka, IL",5 star rating,My friends and I came from America and randomly walked in here to eat. Everything was so beautiful and the food was great. The woman who started the non for profit organization that runs the restaurant talked to us and explained how people come in and volunteer as waiters or as chefs. The food was incredible and the fact that this is a NFP restaurant warmed my heart.

/user_details?userid=PqQgemFs2K0f8dPiejwnnw,Cory B.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"What a great place. I love the idea they have come up with. The servers are all volunteers and so is much of the other staff.  All the profits and tips go to feed people in need.  Cool idea!  Then, the food is also great!  What a peaceful and enjoyable place."
/user_details?userid=b4Co_6GZZDLndQPGX53hEw,Mona P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing place!  Stumbled by it one day and made reservations to go there the week after.  What a nice concept.  The decor is also very homey and makes you feel instantly very comfortable.  It helps that the waiters don't seem to be in a rush at all since they're all volunteers.  Even your tip goes to charity!! And of course the food was actually amazing. They change their menu from time to time so the same options are not always available but if you get a chance to try their lentil dahl, do it.  It was hands down the most flavourful and spiced-infused dahl I've ever tasted.  Mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it.After that, I ordered the lamb which was pretty good. The presentation was very nice.Another compliment to the bread!  So crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside - the way bread is supposed to be.  I went with some Bretons (who apparently are bread and butter experts, or so they claim) and they confirmed that it was, indeed, bread of excellent quality.  We asked them to refill the bread about 3 times and at the end, our waiter was so sweet and gave us a doggy-bag for the remainder in our basket.Robin des Bois made both my stomach and heart happy."
/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have the Voir Restaurant Guide 2008. It tell it's a good restaurant, the location is good. etc. I went there with a friend with his new «I only eat organic» Girlfriend.  Thought her hippy insight would appreciate the restaurant focus is organic food as well as all profits goes to organization. The concept is great and the Volountering Waiter, in a business Point of view was really good. We went there on a lousy monday night, restaurant was mostly empty. (bad weather). The place itself is great the decor is nice and there's definetely enough places for 80-100 persons. We get the menu and we're automatically told some thing on the menu are missing. Better now then later I Guess, but never a good thing. I've gotten a pea soup and a duck springroll with a little salad. The taste was pretty good for the roll but the others and the other at the table we merely satisfied by their meal. Plain seasam oiled carrot salad. Really Boring and if didn't have the masserated taste of a good carrot salad. The World Cooking was to be understood especially with the theme of giving out profits but in my opinion, if you can't do world food properly just don't do it and stick to what you know. So basically, I felt the amateur way the restaurant was being manage and even though I did felt it was for a good cause, I'd rather give 100$ to a non-profit diner where it is manage by professional and paid staff. Overall, good price, ok service, so-so food."
