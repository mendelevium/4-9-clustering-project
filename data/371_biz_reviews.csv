And although they have an a la carte menu, the house specials ranging in price from $19 to $23 are plenty to choose from. With the main dish of your choosing (today there was a range from chicken ravioli to veal cutlet to stuffed calamari), you choose an appetizer. The hubster got shrimp mousse and I got gazpacho, perfect for the heat wave right now. The hubsters's veal meal was superb while my stuffed calamari was good (mainly because there were only two small pieces but plenty tasty). Then we got the cute dessert tart and the lil mousse in the cup with coffee or tea. This, with the good value wines they offered, plus the view and the gracious staff, all proved a fantastic lunch spot. Hint: you'll have trouble snagging rezzies on the phone so go at museum opening, head to the 2nd floor, and though closed, you can walk in to talk to the staff about same day lunch rezzies. Then enjoy the museum exhibits for a coupla hours and go back for lunch. Voila! Perfect sight seeing day. You're welcome."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Reasonably priced, and great portion sizes. (3.5/5)Although this restaurant is in a museum, it is worth going to. The view on the restaurant's floor is beautiful and is great for panoramic pictures of old Montreal. As for the food, I opted for the ""quick lunch"": a hot dog ""smoked meat"" sandwich, which came with fries and some salad as well as a soup. For $14, you really can't go wrong, especially in old Montreal. The soup of the day was a beets soup with a drop of cream and mint leaves. It was really delicious and comforting. The flavours were really nice and it had a great consistency. I was very satisfied with it. The hod dog ""smoked meat"" sandwich was good, nothing special. I was expecting it to taste more like smoked meat and was also expecting a little bit more sauerkraut and mustard. Honestly, I was kind of hoping to finish it right away so that I can eat the fries and salad haha (which were both really good). Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick bite for lunch. However, I would suggest getting something other than the hot dog ""smoked meat""."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for a quiet weekday lunch so being able to make a reservation by phone for a table makes it simple. The restaurant decor is a  bit drab, almost cafeteria like. Surrounded by urban grey concrete, a little bit of extra warmth in the decor would probably improve my appetite. However, the food is a solid 4/5 so my appetite didn't need that much help! With a menu that changes every few weeks, and the lastest one not up on their Facebook site yet, it was going to be a surprise. The restaurant is only about a third full on weekdays and all the window seats were occupied by patrons. If you want a window seat, remember to ask!I agree with another Yelper on the bread. It would've been better served warm. Otherwise, it's still ok. The Mexican soup was very well flavored even though it was sparse on ingredients. It had some tortilla chips and a bit of avocado cubes but no cheese. Was great for dipping the bread. The cretons had congealed fat on top and the bottom. I scraped it off as I don't find lard as an appealing spread...but the cretons themselves were less fat as a result so I was happy with that outcome. It's served with onion, orange jam and I tasted a hint of licorice/fennel (?) which helped balance the fattiness. You can definitely ask for more bread.  Main dishes were chorizo crusted cod on darphin potatoes, which were really unique way of cooking potatoes and rich tasting, with mixed roasted veggies. The cod was well-flavored and tender.The squash/almond stuffed ravioli ended up a bit dry and pastey especially since the cauliflower sauce was dryish as well. The smoked quail was delightful though just a touch on the salty side. However if eaten together with the ravioli would probably be balanced. I would've liked more green onions on the raviolis as it perks up the flavor.Dessert was a small sugar tart which was average tasting. The crust wasn't anything special. It was served with a terrine of white chocolate yogurt sauce on raspberry coulis. Lunch menu table d'hôte comes with a coffee, tea or tisane. Service was acceptable. Venue is quiet so great for conversation. View of the Old Port quays is quite alright. For me, this place is a pretty strong ""like"" but not quite yet at ""love""."

The view is unbeatable and the food was great too. I had soup, a salmon dish, dessert, hot tea, and a glass of wine for less than $40 American (including the tip). The staff was very friendly and accommodating. This is not your typical museum restaurant, it's a real gem."
/user_details?userid=zIXUuzj1c819jQLkqTfBBQ,Annie D.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the best-kept secret in Montreal. Where else can you have a 3-course meal with coffee/tea and sit on a sunny terrace with a gorgeous view of Old Montreal/Port all for under $22? NOWHERE!! Oh and if that's too rich for your blood you can get a proper meal for under $14.First thing first, the restaurant is only open for lunch and reservations are required. I called 2 weeks in advance to book a table on the terrace and was not able to get the time-slot I wanted, so I would say call a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Pointe-à-Callière Museum in Old Montreal and located right next to the St. Lawrence River. Since we were early, we went up to the third floor of the museum and went out onto a lookout where you get gorgeous views of Old Montreal (free to do whether you go to the restaurant or not). The restaurant itself is gorgeous! It's glass-walled, filled with light and had exceptional views whether you are sitting out on the terrace or not. But the terrace is where it's at!!! Pretty cobalt blue umbrellas + sunshine + views + bubbly + good food = happiness! A three-course meal with an appetizer, main and dessert plus tea/coffee was $19.50 to $21.95 depending on what you ordered. They also have express options for under $14 which was still a good amount of food. Since it was so cheap I really wasn't expecting much and boy was I shocked. Every item we had was absolutely fresh and delicious. Their menu changes weekly I believe and its pasted on their Facebook page.The service was also exceptional. We had the most friendly server who practiced his English with us. He was so great that I had to track down the manager and put in a good word for him.Honestly, for the price, this was the best food experience I had in Montreal (actually anywhere) and I had so many amazing food experiences there. With the views alone they could charge at least double for the food, never mind that the quality of the food itself was awesome. This place really is a hidden gem but I don't know how long it will stay that way. GO HERE NOW!!"

Delicious baguette that would tasted even better warm! A wonderful little place for a 3 course lunch. You can also order a la cart!

/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Having lunch here was a nice and unexpected surprise! We were originally going to Olive & Gourmando, but we discovered that the wait time there was an hour; needless to say, we decided to go elsewhere. After searching 'brunch' on yelp, we spent about 10 minutes looking for the restaurant, which is actually on the second floor of the museum. Upon our arrival, fifteen minutes before the restaurant opened, we were told that all indoor seats were already reserved. However, there was still space out the balcony, so we grabbed a spot outside. The view from the terrasse was nice; I imagine that it would be amazing on a sunnier day. Service was fast and accommodating, and the hostess explained the meals of the day (meat, pasta, soup) very thoroughly before giving us time to order. Our bread was refilled when she noticed we were out, and coffee was brought very quickly, though it tasted average. As for the food, we were extremely pleased. The presentation was beautiful, and the meals were fantastic. I got the meat of the day, duck with lasagna, and the cold pea soup; my boyfriend, the pasta and the salad. We were super lucky we got a spot today. Next time I'll make sure to reserve in advance!"

/user_details?userid=GrXhtw32fIvzU8Wp-8cDNg,Victoria L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is where i have taken anyone who has ever visited me in Montreal. One of my favorite restaurants hidden on the second floor of a old montreal museum, with set menus and brunch all around $15-20. The food quality is unreal and a true taste of french cuisine. They also have a beautiful patio for the summer time!their wine options are all very fairly priced and the waiters here made great recommendations that paired well with our meal!!For brunch I loveeeeeee their sampler set, a mix of sweet and savory treats that are all so individually made with such care. During the week, their menu options change weekly to integrate the freshest seasonal ingredients so check out their FB page for updates!"
/user_details?userid=uDoXwYNzBHP5sI8CXJb3Ew,Daniel Y.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Terrible service, good food.Came into the restaurant and was seated. Ten minutes later, someone comes with bread and water and says I'll be right back to take your orders (where typically they would take a drink order.Longer than ""right back"" later, he comes back and asks for our orders. We need to prompt him on what the Chef's Suggestion and the Catch of the Day is, and then I ask if there was anything else on the menu I should know. He said no. And then he said ""Oh yes, the soup is vegetable cream"". Ignores our empty bread and leaves.Is it discrimination against English speakers? Or if you don't want to be a server my suggestion to you is to find another job.But good food though!"
/user_details?userid=xnsdh6cnfmaP9hxada3jLQ,Elodie T.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"L'Arrivage has a gorgeous setting- lots of natural lighting. Unlike our initial thoughts, you don't actually have to pay museum admission to go to L'Arrivage (although we were planning to go anyways), and it is easily accessible from the elevator. While you're at it, before/after your meal, you can also go up to the third floor and take in a view of Vieux Port. My sister and I chose this based on a Frommer's book recommendation which said that options started at CA$12. Sure enough, they had express options of CA$12-13 that we ended up choosing, which still provided a soup, our choice of entree, and coffee or tea. My sister chose the sandwich option and I chose the salad option, both of which were very refreshing and tasty. Our soup of the day was a gazpacho, which I thought was tasty but a little less smooth than expected. Overall, great lunch option in a beautiful setting. Solid 4/5."
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,A friend of mine brought me here for brunch on a rainy Sunday morning. I really like the concept of paying for a plate and getting a 3 course brunch included. I opted for the sausage crepe meal and a cream of onion soup. Dessert was a pineapple meringue and raspberry smoothie. The good: Service was excellent. Our very attractive french waiter was super nice and explained the specials really well. He also kept up with the water refills and brought a new bread basket when were were running low. The crepe and soup were savoury and delicious. Just what I needed on a rainy morning. The flavours were a bit on the heavy side but I think that the meal was overall very filling and satisfying. The bad:The coffee here is terrible. Folgers coffee. Basically tasted like instant coffee. I couldn't drink it. The dessert was more lackluster than anything else. The smoothie was basically yogurt and the meringue was way too sweet to be edible. I think dessert here is a hit or miss. Overall decent brunch place in Old Port. Interesting location and a fairly inexpensive place for the area.
/user_details?userid=aW8sP6L1yn9D9EsxA2sDBg,Patty A.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing, and very reasonable. Being in Montreal the portions are small but filling. I had the pre-fix, which started with a vegetable soup, with croutons and a dollip of cheese - delicious and light. That followed with duck and meat sandwich which was so tasty and not heavy, and crispy fries. Dessert was tres leches with a pumpkin pudding with cinnamon créeme fresh. Beautiful view of the port, and snow falling...perfect lunch!"
/user_details?userid=YuqDUCd5lpwluRHfxtqDvA,Alex A.,"Trenton, NJ",1 star rating,"The only thing that was good here was the bread and dessert. Everything else was very poorly prepared, and we tasted between 3 separate dishes. Soup was very watery. Salad is nothing to write home about. Vegetables as part of entre were definitely overcooked. When we asked to replace the included soup with a dessert (we tried from one of the plates only), we got attitude from the waitress, with snide remarks. The meat (beef with one entre, and lamb with another) was decent, though I'd stay away from duck sausage. We got another dessert for our son, because he couldn't eat the sausage (it tasted nasty to me as well). We waited for a check for a good 5-7 minutes after they took the dish away. I got tired, and as soon as I got up, she came running with the cc machine. And when the time came to pay, the waitress rebuked me for not tipping her - attitude + subpar meal... really?"
/user_details?userid=G5jjG2iR8qrEG_4MSvQwdw,Stephen P.,"Louisville, CO",4 star rating,"Very good upscale-casual modern French food, deliciously prepared and artistically plated, with friendly service. Three courses for lunch with many choices totalling around $20 makes it reasonable for the area. It's in the museum: convenient if you're visiting, but open to all. Most of the view for the next year seems to be construction on the closest pier, but the setting is still nice inside & out."
/user_details?userid=viNGKugjVOzXrHD3wv-Wrg,Hal T.,"Cincinnati, OH",5 star rating,"Much enjoyed my lunch here during a brief visit to Montreal.  I thought it was better than the four stars, not really five stars but more like 4 1/2 so I rounded up to five. Almost didn't even dining room as the place was empty at 11:40 on a Wednesday. As I was debating where to go next, a few people walked in which encouraged me to stay. Very glad I did, as every facet of the experience was excellent. Service was attentive and friendly. All portions of the 3-course meal was excellent. Had the sirloin of Beef as entree. Very tender even though I ordered medium."
/user_details?userid=xKmuExZzmeEzgY1U_UUimg,Joetta G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"The highlight of a visit to a very weird museum. We were starving and hesitant to eat here, but are so glad we went.Yes, we had to wait a bit because it was a busy lunch hour, but they were friendly and attentive in their service once we were seated (well, except the waiter forgot to bring the mayo I requested, but I didn't bother reminding him).We had their version of a kir royal (sparkling wine with their ice cider) and it was a perfect start. Then I had the quesadilla (odd choice, I know, but I was in the mood) which came with fries and a small green salad. My boyfriend had the meat of the day, which was veal rib and was to die for. It came with a salad to start, then the rib which was meltingly tender, atop some garbanzo beans, pureed parsnip, and I think roasted eggplant. Then a dessert to finish--blueberry cake with blueberry cream cheese frosting and a peanut custardy thing with crushed peanuts on top. They also brought me one, even though I didn't order the meal--so yummy! It also came with coffee at the end, a nice finish.The pacing of the meal was relaxed and friendly, and we left there SO HAPPY."

/user_details?userid=5adYZXIY5-ZvdKSfC4QIDg,Jennie C.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"This was the lowlight of my trip to Montreal, a foodie city. Came here Saturday for lunch, and stood around for a good 40 minutes without anybody acknowledging my presence. The guy who should have been at the host stand was busy running around. I understand they are super-busy around that time, but at least he could have came & gave me an estimate on the wait (especially since he walked past me numerous times). This was especially unforgivable when they had a small table available in the back of the dining room!Nonetheless I stayed for the food. The price was decent, but the food didn't make up for the neglecting service. The cauliflower curry soup was watery and had so much curry flavor it completely overshadowed the ""cauliflower"", if there was any. The broiled fish was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. So I guess the kitchen made up for that by making the sauce extra salty. The risotto it came with tasted only like chicken broth. To add insult to injury, the food looked like it sat under the warming lamp too long: a skin had formed on the sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes had a dried surface. Dessert (cinnamon & rum creme brulee and rhubarb sorbet with baked meringue) was decent. The only thing good was my server, who took the time to introduce my dishes when they came out.While the price was great, the food was only so-so, and the service at the host stand completely turned me off. Definitely NOT worth returning given the wide selection of amazing restaurants in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=HQv3cpiQz4vd7LWyn7JH1Q,Lesley T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Does someone on your team at work have a birthday or a special occasion and you're not sure where to go? Situated on the top floor of Pointe-à-Callière, the Montréal Museum of Archaeology and History, L'Arrivage is a great spot for a business lunch if you're not in a hurry. You'll usually see several groups of office workers there. In the summer they have tables of two on the terrace with a great view of the Old Port. They've recently updated the décor slightly, and the result renders a bit more industrial chic.Reservations are essential because the place generally fills up. Service can be slow once it gets full, so my colleagues and I usually show up at 11:45 so we can get our orders in and beat the rush. We've had lots of practice, you see - we've been doing birthday lunches there for several years. Sometimes I suggest trying someplace new, but no one will have it: L'Arrivage is too sure a bet, they say. Their lunch menu is perhaps pricey for a weekday lunch but a great value for what you get. You start with a soup or salad, which is always inventive and flavorful. Today's salad was a Nordic shrimp mousse with a fennel and orange salad.  The selection of main dishes always includes one vegetarian option (and my vegetarian friends always seem to enjoy it), and a variety of fish, seafood and meat dishes. Their cuisine is rich, with purees and sauces adding a lot of flavor, and unusual grains and vegetables filling out the plate. Today I had the salmon and tuna tartare with a blini, some type of whipped herb cream cheese, and a sweet caramelized sauce drizzled on the side. My carefully prepared bites were worth the effort: so tasty! Dessert is always a high point at L'Arrivage: they serve a plate with three mini desserts in one. Sorbet often appears, but today it was a parfait of dates, panna cotta and a caramel sauce, a meringue, and a tiny muffin-shaped financier. Very good as always. I was stuffed, but it was too good to leave on the plate."
