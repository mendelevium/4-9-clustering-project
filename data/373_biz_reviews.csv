/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! I've lost count of the times I've been to China, let's be conservative and say it's been 30 times. The food there can be amazing and while most excellent Canadian versions can come close, it's never really quite the same. Szechuan tastes like the best of China!We ordered takeout tonight and could not be happier. The steamed shrimp dumplings were delicious but quite a bit smaller than my favourite places. The fried noodles with veggies were excellent! I really like that they packaged the noodles separately, the noodles were perfectly crisp as a foundation for the other dishes. Barb had the Lemon Chicken which was executed perfectly, very moist with a tasty crisp batter. I ordered Mongolian Beef which was loaded with flank steak, mushrooms and onions. The sauce was so rich and delicious, I've never had this dish on this level. Perfect!The owners were genuinely nice and were thrilled this was my first visit. This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship, I can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=EdJHPE7TO8Nc9bAmCMfrSQ,Aijaz H.,"Lisle, IL",4 star rating,Tried this place out on our recent trip to Montreal. Food was good however bit on the pricey side. We ordered Grouper in hot chilli oil and Prawns in garlic sauce. Supplemented the two dishes with veggie fried rice. Everything was good... no complaints. Loved the plate of fresh fruit on the house in the end. Nice touch.

/user_details?userid=z2lggxfEJgOMhRH2WrRTAQ,Giancarlo G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"It starts with Chef Ma, and all the staff.Friendly, professional and an obvious pride in their craft.Up from NYC on a recent trip, and found one of the best Chinese food restaurants we've dined at in a long time. Appreciated the attention to and focus on a lighter, fresher approach, which is thankfully now more available in NYC and nearby Flushing. (More authentic, and less thick and sugary and artificially spicey.)From the warm greeting, through a variety of no-miss dishes, and capped off with a complementary fresh fruit finish, we could not recommend this restaurant more."
/user_details?userid=n5pxsvLjW8zum_4T5AnneQ,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Absolutely unbelievably delicious Chinese food. I was devastated when Mr. Ma closed but the owners resurrected the kitchen and all its wonders at this location. You will leave happy and full!
/user_details?userid=AhnsP--qQZEebiDIxfJZBQ,James M.,"Hunt Club East - Western Community, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Great welcome from both of the owners (including the chef) and very delicious food. Make sure to meet the owners if you can as they are the heart and soul of the place. Our fish was especially fresh, tender, and flavourful. Szechuan offers much higher quality beef than what you will find in typical Chinese restaurants. Vegetables and stir fried dishes were delicious. My wife grew up win China with a father whose passion was cooking for his family and friends, and she was most favourably impressed, which is the highest praise that I can offer to any Chinese restaurant."

/user_details?userid=_bsX51G0vz4YwAIUFSJsbw,Steve C.,"Deltona, FL",5 star rating,Excellent service. We had the Generals chicken and the pieces were very large and tender. Usually you get very small pieces and the breading is overpowering. Not here nice large pieces and a large portion. The vegetable fried rice was very light and full of vegetables. Highly recommend this establishment
/user_details?userid=iwixoPRONGl6Cg1UmW1yHQ,Charlotte D.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Not authentic at all! I ordered dishes with Szechuan sauce and it is not spicy at all (in general it's just not the right taste). The soup is too salty and wrong  vegetables are used. Given the price, I'm very disappointed."
/user_details?userid=W5d6IXgudb_UlCJAmunNpA,Alan L.,"Huntington Woods, MI",5 star rating,"I know this sounds over the top but this is the best Chinese food I ever tasted, and I've tasted my share. I ordered the General's chicken. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was very tasty but not not cloying. The broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots were tender. The rice was not the clumpy, tasteless, white substance usually served in Chinese restaurants. Instead it was a delicately prepared rice where I could easily separate the individual grains of rice. The dessert consisted of a plate of ripe fruit. Even the the Jasmine the was unusually fragrant. It was obviously somebody took the pride in the quality of the food they served."
/user_details?userid=g_of1WdCFk6Uq0iVauYrFw,Roy S.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"Very solid Chinese restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal at the intersection of Rue Notre Dame and Sainte Helene--a block or two away from the Hotel Gault where I recently stayed.Very good lunch specials during the week. Probably the best General Tso Chicken I have had anywhere with high quality chicken breast, fried rice, corn soup with crabmeat, and a spring roll as part of the lunch special. The sauce on my my chicken was rich and delicious--high quality Chinese food, not fast food--and a little bit, but not too, spicy. I would like to come back and try their Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce. Definitely worth a shot--surprised by the earlier review."
/user_details?userid=fckWXoZDnoqnatJeC5KQQw,Rebecca C.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"We were wandering around Old Montreal and happened across this small restaurant and we were glad we stopped. The staff were fabulous. They timed the meal very well, kept the water glasses full, multilingual, and not at all intrusive. We started with some appetizers and shared a main. The waiter brought us clean plates for each part of the meal; the dinner plates were even warmed. We had the dumplings and bon bon chicken to start. Both were good, but the sauce on the bon bon chicken was super delicious. If they sold bottles of it, I would have taken it home with me. For a main, we chose the sizzling beef. It was actually sizzling! The waiter finished off the dish table side and it just smelled amazing. It tasted equally good. I enjoyed that the vegetables were more than just the standard fare and included a variety of mushroom types. I really liked that at the end of the meal we got the standard fortune cookies and as well as almond cookies (they're my fav!)."

We were on our way to another restaurant when it started raining and we stumbled into this place.  Really glad we did. This place has great NON GRESY food, and the service, oh the service, so good. I encourage anyone to try this place. Also important, we have a 1 year old.  These guys were very accommodating and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very pleasant."
/user_details?userid=N7Y-xS48j6_qttC2jyf-LA,Gabriel K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is definitely one of my favourite spots for Szechuan food. Prices are a little toward the high side, but the food and impeccable service are totally worth it."
/user_details?userid=i1XAHltBpZC5zP5skcwVGw,Jinko G.,"Altadena, CA",4 star rating,If you're looking for a nice Chinese restaurant in Old Montreal you've found the right spot.  Last fall I came with a Chinese family from Australia and had a solid banquet dinner.  Last week I had a solo dinner.  To my surprise they had a dinner menu for one.  I started with a cup of hot and sour soup followed by shredded Hunan pork served with sauteed vegetables served with steamed rice.  For dessert a fruit cup and made in Canada fortune and almond cookies....

/user_details?userid=kqWEFSyY0BM3wxjnTmbIpw,Roberta Z.,"San Dimas, CA",5 star rating,We were very lucky to find this restaurant while walking by our hotel.  The food was good and the service was excellent.
