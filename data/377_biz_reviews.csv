/user_details?userid=1BqEOPuZIBnFxYqgpvuGlw,Michael B.,"Langley, Canada",4 star rating,"ZIBO is a great place for a meal to start your visit in Montreal for sure. We had a great dinner there and our server Johnathan was A lot of fun with our convo. His guidance through the menu as well as drink suggestions where helpful. The zucchini crisps are different for sure and the calamari where really good, I'm usually not a fan of chipotle but here it's great with the calamari, it's not to heavy tasting or spicy. We shared the New York steak with an ad on of sautéed mushrooms for our main course and it was plenty of food for my wife and I to share.The veggies and Parmesan potatoes where prepared beautifully. I had a few local IPA's that I really enjoyed, supporting local craft breweries, especially when they are up on their game is a passion of mine as I love a great locally inspired beer!!The apple crumble finished our meal brilliantly!!!A real apple dish cooked the way it should be. I highly recommend this stylish restaurant downtown if you're looking for a great night out."
/user_details?userid=Uyvh1jijLf_18j2mzzNtYw,Teresa H.,"Milwaukee, WI",2 star rating,"Went here the night before running a marathon for a quick bite. I had the chicken and my husband had a burger. Both were fairly priced pretty solid. Food came out relatively quickly and service, initially, was attentive.But here's the downside. It took us 55 minutes to get our check. I know it was 55 because I started timing it after 10ish minutes had passed as I was ready to go and catch some sleep before the marathon. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing- I've noticed traveling in Europe unless you specifically ask for a tab you tend to sit around for quite a while- but we were actively looking around the restaurant for at least 30 of the 55 minutes. She seemed to completely ignore our stares. We finally asked another server and she said she'd get our waitress... but we continued to wait at least 10 minutes after that. Finally we got up to go find her- we awkwardly paid and left. The time waiting for the check completely ruined any positive aspects of the experience.Food was a 3/5Service was a 1/5"

/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for the first time for a coworker's birthday. I've heard about this place a lot but never any decisive good/bad reviews. It's just a good place for business people to have lunch or a drink after work. It gets very crowded during lunchtime and dinnertime. Make a reservation. I found the service to be quite good despite the crowd, my coworkers had gone once more than me and they said the service last time was so slow that they had to take most of it to go. I didn't get the name of our waiter but he was really fantastic. Nice, attentive, fast, and friendly. I got the salmon tartare and it was good, not the best I've ever had but good enough. The fries that came with it were cold though. So if you aren't a fan of cold fries, skip this option. I thought they were fine despite being cold.The real standout to me was the dessert. I got this cookie dough thing with Nutella and chocolate chips with vanilla ice cream on top. It was so good I was still craving it 2 days later. Not at all a bad place to get lunch or dinner."
/user_details?userid=bI5b9gC4HJ_qAefoG850bw,Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",4 star rating,"****3.75****I visited this place a few times while in Montreal. Had 2 different experiences. First visit ,dinner and drinks with coworker at bar. Service for alcohol and food was very slow. Second visit was with customers. This visit was worst than the  first visit. To get a can of beer, it took 7-10 minutes. Four out of ten of my guest order their steak medium to medium rare.  Of the  four, 3 well done and 4th burnt. I ordered the same dish I loved just 4 days earlier when I was there, bass Veracruz, and it was like a different cook made the dish and it lacked the flavor that I came to appreciate on the first visit. Management was very responsive. Because of the service issues, they comped a desert platter which was nice. Overall, bar service extremely slow, no matter if you are at the bar or a table. The food service is extremely slow. I do like te restaurant in general. I would definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good food and good service. Note that the items on the menu are 1$ more expensive than other zibo locations. You can never go wrong with their food. It's creative, delicious and fresh. The appetizers such as the zucchini chips and the fried calamaris are great. The sausages were very special. The salmon tartare is a must try as it is very fresh and has some crunch to it. As for the dessert, the nutella cake with ice cream is just so soft and chewy. The service is great. The staff were always nice and friendly everytime and the food arrived quickly. The ambiance is nice, perfect place to have a chat and catch up with friends. This location has 2 floors. It is situated in the center of downtown, 2 blocks from mcgill metro."
/user_details?userid=ylpWc3hukBIHpGhqqboT5w,Maria A.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,Came at the awful transition time in between lunch and dinner. Service was slow- hard to gauge who was our actual server which may have been part of the problem. I had the zucchini chips and the French onion soup. The zucchini chips were delicious. The soup looked yummy but was lacking in flavor. Grabbed a small slice of my friend's pizza which was just okay. Good location.
/user_details?userid=DBme-mhYtRpxtDwj9PX9Aw,Lisa R.,"Mamaroneck, NY",2 star rating,This place is so lame! I'm reading through these reviews for second time. The general Taos chicken was cold. Whomever wrote the review about putting hot sauce on this dish you shouldn't have to put hot sauce on Chinese dishes. Also when you serve a meal with chopsticks I shouldn't have to cut huuuuuge pieces of chicken with a knife. Bad beer selection. I came here thinking it was pizza. After seeing the menu I decided against that. Maybe my mistake. Weird menu. I don't know why it's so busy. Worst meal I had in Montreal!

/user_details?userid=qH7F4rYyQhofhjyOPWrJ6A,Corinne B.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,The meal I had at ZIBO! was so good! The poutine was an upgrade option on the regular fries that come with the sandwich menu items for an additional cost but still cheaper than ordering an additional poutine and ending up with too many fries. The steak sandwich completely hit the spot! There was a discount applied for using a Marriott credit card and staying at the Marriott downtown renaissance whichh is just across the street. We arrived late and decided to have the food as take out and just waited at the restaurant bar while the food was prepared. The experience was enjoyable and I will go back there again when I next have a chance as everything is excellent there. The other entree my fiancé ordered was also very tasty. It was a beef dish too. They seem to have great dessert choices though we did not have a chance to try it on our recent visit.

/user_details?userid=tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,Jay M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Montreal has the issue of many restaurants closing on Monday nights, especially, so we ended up here without much excitement after finding it as one of the few options available in the area. At first glance, this seems like a good spot for corporate dining where nothing is great but the menu is wide enough to appease the masses. And part of me was even more skeptical when I ordered ""General Tao Chicken"" from a place which seems to focus on pizza and pasta and generic ""Canadian"" food, but when thrown in a bowl with pineapple and mango relish, rice and broccoli (and a healthy amount of hot sauce), I couldn't help but be impressed.Throw in some happy hour (err, 5 a 7?) specials on drinks and an impressively made mojito for my dining companion and over all we were pretty happy with our visit. Admittedly once our food came out, the service went a bit downhill (getting hot sauce was a chore, as was asking for our bill), but overall we were happy enough to consider a return should our hands be forced on future Monday nights."

This restaurant was still open. The menu had choices that satisfied all four of our varied tastes.  Our server was friendly and was quick to respond to our requests. Wish they had locations in the US.

/user_details?userid=kSn1iHc15wBMh6UgeEedfA,John F.,"Chesterfield, NJ",1 star rating,Across the street from my hotel.   I was craving poutines and didn't feel like walking far.   Unfortunately while waiting for the food bartender told me they ran out of Poutine gravy.  It was an hour before closing but would think you never run out of that.  I'll try another time.  Bartender was nice she felt bad and always offers me free fries but I was craving poutine!
/user_details?userid=Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A,Tiffany D.,"West Chester, OH",4 star rating,"Zibo was actually pretty good. My husband and I met up with some friends here for a late night dinner and just to catch up. It was across the street from their hotel, and right up the street from where we were staying. Because it was late we didn't do any appetizers. We all just ordered our food. I ordered the Dijon Chicken, my husband and the other male ordered the Blackened Cajun Chicken Breast with a Peppery Pineapple Relish. The other female ordered some type of pasta dish. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I really enjoyed my Dijon chicken and the fellas really like the blackened chicken. All of our dishes besides the pasta dish were served with roasted potatoes. Overall, Zibo has good food and I would recommend them to others. My only complaint was they were a little slow serving the food and it was only 4 of us (2 couples). I guess (my husband saw a big party when he went to the bathroom) they had 1 or 2 big parties so we got there around 8:50 PM and didn't leave until like 10:45 PM/11:00 PM."
/user_details?userid=hyVf5YCKUCwFkcUc-0QgZg,Barbara K.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"We came here for lunch on a rather windy and rainy Saturday. The food and the atmosphere itself was really 3-star worthy, but our waiter was outstanding, so I gave an extra star. He even spoke in English to us, which was very appreciated! (Everyone in our party thought his name was something different - so unfortunately, I cannot give a shout out by name.) All of the staff were very helpful and friendly, I appreciated that I could tell the waiter was familiar with the menu and was very passionate about food. It all came out quickly and was warm-  they forgot bacon on a burger and their vegetarian selection was pretty limited. But the food was good quality and we left full and still with some Canadian dollars in our pocket."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Zibo with a friend quite late in the evening and the waiter looked a bit impatient since my friend only arrived after 40min. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite nice, good vibes and modern interior decor. Located right in downtown, the place is quite pricey but still successful amongst locals and tourists.The waiter recommended a fruity white wine from Quebec and it was quite nice. My friend ordered their mango chicken and I tried their salmon tartar. Despite the high price, I wasn't flattered by the food and I think that I had much better ones elsewhere paying the same price. They have big portions and I had a hard time finishing my dish. Otherwise it was a relaxing spot to chill with friends and enjoy a good glass of wine."
/user_details?userid=4HQG1t2NQQeuSw7s-su6-w,Colditz K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3 star rating,"This score is recovered due to the good service service. Our waiter gave us the best service of all the restaurants we ate while in Montreal. He made good suggestions, was present and observant, and made the evening a delight.The food was on the mediocre side, and when we arrived at 8:45pm on a Sunday night initially we were informed the kitchen was closed (which we thought was rather early). On the later visit when we finally dined there, this no longer seemed to be a problem.While the hotel told us that this place was an ""italian restuarant"" I'd probably just call it ""american."" There was wide range of different foods, and the tastes were extremely eclectic. This kind of reflects the american mentality where pretty much all the food is available."

The calamari comes with a chipotle mayo that is amazing. I had the beef bavette which was also delicious. Great atmosphere and attentive and pleasant staff. Would definitely recommend.

It's convenient because you can eat quickly. Their lunch menu is affordable, however the portions are very average. Their regular menu is good and diversified. The service is not always consistent with some experiences better than others"
/user_details?userid=PmoyuES2OmZTRPFTRjVCtg,Tom S.,"Lynn, MA",4 star rating,"Really friendly staff and really good service!  Zibo is a little less pricey than some of the other restaurants in the area, so if you are looking for something nicer but not over the top, this is a great option.I got the Mango Pineapple Chicken dish and it was really good.  The piece of chicken was massive and they give a lot of mango and pineapple.  My girlfriend got the Veal meatballs and those were incredible.  Definitely recommend this place to everyone.The only thing I would suggest is make sure that the servers are clear on the drink orders.  My friend ordered a Captain and Coke but got regular Bacardi, not even a spiced rum."

Took my daughter here for her birthday and they were so accommodating. If you go ask for Francesca. She is the best waitress we've ever had.

/user_details?userid=wYmSVw5eDkCOuExhpqcIgQ,Karen W.,"Paso Robles, CA",3 star rating,"What a difference service makes!  The first night we ate here we had a waitress that had just started at the restaurant.  She was very attentive, took our drink order right away and let us set the pace for when our other courses came out (I hate it when the main course comes out while you're still having your appetizer).    We liked it so much that we came back a second night.  What a let down.  Service was slow and impersonal, as a matter of fact we had to get up and ask our waitress' boss if we could please place our order.  I saw our waitress across the room carrying an armload of menus, so it appears management isn't watching too closely the workload they are putting on their staff.Oh - the food?  Really good with a nice variety to choose from."

/user_details?userid=7PltAF2nymgXF7bzAkCP_Q,Peter W.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Very rude waiters there. Went there for drinks in an afternoon. Waited and had to seat ourselves as no one bothered to look up. Finally a waiter came over to take orders and repeatedly told us the beer we wanted was out or unavailable. It was clear to us that we were not valued nor welcomed for unknown reason. Racism? Disheartened to say the least.
/user_details?userid=xe7La1NDz7kmTARpQlhB8g,Eric W.,"Salisbury, MD",2 star rating,"This was a very bad experience.  Not entirely the server's fault but bad nonetheless.  Recommended restaurant but we went on a holiday.  Big mistake.  Left after two hours with takeout bags, and not even the correct food.  Owners or management should be ashamed, or should just close for holidays."

The decor is beautiful and it has a lively amazing vibe. For lunch my friend and I ordered the beef carpaccio. Oh my gosh I have never had anything so amazing before. It was so good that we ordered it 3 times!!! We also tried the ceviche and the poutine which were both amazing. I don't drink hard liquor so I asked for champagne with something fruity and was given champagne with muddled raspberries. It was delicious!!! After our amazing meal, we were greeted by the manager Johnny Christmas who was the nicest and most welcoming person in the world. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone for amazing food and service. I will definitely return for the amazing food and service!!!"

One thing I found weird is for such a beautiful place they give you a small paper napkin instead of an actual cloth napkin! It didn't match the decor! Anyway I ordered the chicken nems (spring rolls) and you get about 7 small crusty nems with a side sauce. This dish was to die for! I also ordered calamari and they were great too. I also ordered their southwest burger with fries but had to wrap it to go since by then I was full! It's a great place with great service and amazing food."

/user_details?userid=lddcjEWD94N2KHFkoNB2Xw,Michelle T.,"South Hadley, MA",3 star rating,"Kids meals are great - the salmon is beautiful and plenty large for a 10 year old. The kids pizza was fine too. The Thai steak salad was pretty nice, but the 'southwest' pasta was weird. It lacked flavor and the pasta was cooked too gummy. It gave me significant indigestion later. The drinks are just meh. I tried their headliner - the spritz - a mix of tequila aperol and orange, and it was rather boring - just bitter with a hint of orange flavor. The service from our server was lackluster. She rushed us to order, then we saw her like 2 more times the entire rest of our dinner. We were seated next to the kitchen, and the kitchen guys took pity on the kids and asked us what we ordered them to drink and brought them milks. In fact, the kitchen guys were the friendliest people in the joint. The beer is fairly priced.  The other thing about the place is it is hipster on steroids - complete with drum and bass and other lame club music pounding over everyone. The kids meals were decent enough that I might recommend it, but definitely not as a 'night out' or treat yourself kind of place."

When I received my steak sandwich it tasted old and ""reheated"" (microwave possibly?), and my friend said her pasta tasted like nothing. Then at the end when I got my bill the waitress forgot to give me a bill to my change, so if I hadn't have noticed her tip would have been 40%. Not worth it."
