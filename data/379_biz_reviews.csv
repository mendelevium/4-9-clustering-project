It's small and cute , romantically lit room and gave off major throwback vibes from a trip to Spain. The waiters were amazing patient and nice , and walked us through the menu and the menu du jour.We had chosen the Paella without Chorizo and the Plancha seared calamari with seasonal vegetables.The food was succulent and full of flavour, you can tell that the chef(s) really enjoy cooking the food from the flavour . The desserts were good ( got the creme brûlée and the strawberry with cream and a surprise ); however the caramelization on top of the creme brûlée wasn't as crunchy as it was supposed to be but it's okay;Would go back again ."
/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,Ethan T.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"Another A+ food experience in Montreal. The service was stellar and our waiter, Christophe was very accommodating, friendly, engaging and knowledgeable about gluten-free options and food allergies. The atmosphere in this restaurant was cool, modern, and chic and the music was nice. The food was amazing and over-all experience was awesome.  My wife had the scallop appetizer and salad and I had one of the lunch specials that included a main entrée, soup or salad, and coffee.  Really nice experience and awesome service!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here as part of an invite. The service was fantastic and the vibes were cool. I tried some tapas, including Spanish omelette, cod fritters, and chorizo stuffed dates. Pretty yummy! My fave bite of the night was the ceviche (amazing), along with the slow-cooked lamb main. Unfortunately, the star of the night - the paella - had some overcooked seafood, probably because of the huge quantity they made for the special night. The presentation of the paella was a showstopper for sure, and the flavour of the saffron rice mixing in with the seafood was decadent. We ended the night with 2 dessert choices, one featuring strawberries and pink peppercorns, while the other was an orange gateau. To be honest, I disliked both desserts, with the gateau being bland, while the pink peppercorns were so obnoxious, they left a bad taste in my mouth!I had a wonderful time with great service and presentation but the food was just not for me... The restaurant itself is located in the Old Port and perfect for date night since it's trendy but not too fancy."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The menu outside caught my attention of whether I was going to eat dinner here. French/Spanish style  food. Soon as we entered and was seated the experience was off to a great start. The staff was more than friendly. Appetizer was the butternut squash soup which was a generous portion. The 12 hour Braised Lamb with spinach topped with almonds was the choice. The presentation of the plate suited the tenderness of the lamb and was exquisite. I loved it! Montreal is a city of great restaurants and I live in the middle of it. Feeling quite satisfied I finished the evening with a cappuccino per usual. This is a definite return to explore other dishes!

We ordered Paella, seafood pasta, lamb shank ( awesome)!They got me the wrong pasta and were so apologetic about it! Got us free wine..! Extra drinks..! Got me the pasta I had ordered in 10 mins! Love this place, must visit when are in a mood for Spanish + French foood!"
/user_details?userid=N0evBQXJjifCDGfSSeLFCg,Ernest T.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"God knows how Pyrénées got a 4 star. People be telling themselves that their food was good just because they paid $30+ for an entree and dropping over $100 for a table of two. I did the same but I'm telling you this place is extremely lacking. Yes the location is great, yes the chef is actually from Catalonia, and yes the service is pretty good, but the food? I rather get a 10 pc combo from Don's Bistro before I come back here.So I had some of the food that the other guests in my table had as well but I ordered the Catalan Paella ($37) and overall everything was a big ""MEH"" topped off with an ""OUCH"" (from the price tag). The Paella is absolutely stunning in appearance. It comes in a little casserole pan and the perimeter is lined up with mussels facing upwards. The middle of the dish has two large wedges of lemon, clams, parsley, shrimp - everything! If there was one thing they did right it was presentation as the dish was bright, colourful, diverse and attractive. However, the mussels were miniscule, the shrimp were not fresh as they were a bit mushy and lacked a crunch, the mussels just tasted like salt, the rice was bland, lacked flavour and was over soaked in whatever broth they used to cook it. There was a ton of broth at the bottom of the pan, and at that point the entree seemed more like a soupe de riz aux fruits de mer than actually paella. Overall the taste of the dish was quite the opposite of everything that it appeared to promise. To top it off it was $37 - no idea where they came up with that price (other than looking at their rent) as the ingredients they used, which were neither fresh or expensive, were not worth nearly that amount."

The waitress gladly handed me the dessert menu and I ordered the plate with 4 kinds of cheese which were fantastic! She added slices of bread to go along with my cheeses and I had the best desserts - I left a generous tip afterward. Definitely, I will go back to get other things from the menu."
/user_details?userid=Gu9ABD8s7i013_Gf66cbAA,Cendy C.,"Gainesville, VA",5 star rating,"This place is the bomb! Why? Because...1. Staff are SUPER friendly - shoutout to Jeremy (our French waiter) 2. Location is right in the heart of old town Montreal 3. Food is delicious My colleagues and I dropped into the restaurant around 7:30pm with no reservation and they took us right in. The menu has a good variety, including their daily special menu. Service was on point too. We started off with a bottle of wine, a starter and then our entrees. The wait staff provided the wrong entree for one of my colleague but within seconds placed in the correct order. He even gave us extra wine to top off our glass (holla!). In the end we decided to order the chocolate cake dessert. It originally comes with whipped cream but again, our waiter came to our rescue and happily swapped the whipped cream with vanilla ice cream when we asked. The best surprise was the dessert drinks he gave each of us! I cannot express how awesome the service was. Jeremy not only provided excellent service but went above and beyond by taking a boomerang of us (with multiple tries). Such a great experience to kick off my trip!"
/user_details?userid=V4BL4o4q6PMbhiGrfYn0wA,Jim H.,"Chattanooga, TN",5 star rating,Fantastic meal. Duck was on point and the sides more than held to it's standard. Quebec cheese plate was a delight. The strength of Les Pyrannes is it's staff. So very welcoming from start-to-finish.
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,Friendly service and excellent food.Landed here with a group of friends after Barocco lost my table reservation!I took the braised pork chick and it was tender and full of flavour! The sauce was so well balanced.All of my friends were extremely happy with their dish as well.The two bottles of wine we selected were also excellent.Will definitely recommend and come back. Price was also very reasonable given the fact that the restaurant is located in the old port.

The owner, whose family is originally from the Catalan region, was very friendly, as well as all the staff. Everything was just delicious, from salad to fish to dessert. We'll be back next time we're in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=w6-BIAHnjKdAUmGnD5gFig,Caroline G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1 star rating,"Paella was terrible. After seeing street vendors making the dish I hoped the shell fish would be fresh. The first mussel was bad and I did not eat another bite. The rice maybe was not bomba rice but did not soak in the flavor as in Basque or Spanish paella. My son had a rice dish and a vegetable lasagna which I had bite of each. They were bland. Presentation of the dishes was attractive and portions small. The waiter was not interested in filling my water glass, checking on us or serving the wine. Few patrons in the restaurant my receipt of $90.37 says serveur 2. I paid after asking for the bill twice. I added a tip assuming someone had a bad day, which I now regret.I didn't send anything back or complain, they seemed not to care to clear plates full of food.  14 September 2018"
/user_details?userid=PqI494Hy7C3hZIVaGpc2vg,Emy P.,"St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada",2 star rating,"Tourist trap. Be careful guys.This restaurant is pretty good looking. Trendy architecture, comfy seating. Service was ok.I had high expectations of the food there based on the previous reviews about this place. I was very disappointed. Italian sausages pasta were overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavour. There is a range of vegetarian options on their menu and I decided to get the végé burger. The plate / presentation was simple and the burger was just ok. You have to expect prices to be higher in Old Port since it's Old Port, but this was way overpriced.I won't go back there for sure. In a few cases, I give the restaurant a second try, but not this one."
/user_details?userid=wgLMdGGbKQpvaqZbRWicpg,David F.,"Purcellville, VA",5 star rating,"Cozy spot with a charming staff and creative, delicious dishes.   Wife and I shared a paella feast for our main.  Look at that picture!  It was loaded with so much top quality seafood, we could barely finish it.  Perfect balance of flavors.One minor suggestion to the manager - while the background music is not loud, electronic beat music isn't the right genre for your ambiance."

Food is excellent and so is the service.The wine waiter recommended went well with the course we ordered.We ordered Chorizo and Shrimp Risotto and Paella, with 2 wine on top and the dessert of day, which is a almond and cherry cake.Will definitely come here again!"
/user_details?userid=eLwBpaKnlbKEhOZGy7bnyQ,Ani J.,"Vienna, VA",3 star rating,"I decided to try this restaurant as they have a few vegetarian options.  Its located on Rue St Paul, which is the oldest street in Montreal. The restaurant is well decorated and as we were going through the menu, the waitress came out and welcomed us in.The service was good and attentive.  I decided to try one of their vegetarian burgers (picture attached).  It was ok.  I should have tried the couscous I feel.  The burger was a bit bland for my taste.  But I like the fact that there are other vegetarian options to try, and not just one that vegetarians are stuck with.If you are a vegetarian, definitely try out this place. I wasnt too pleased with what I ordered, but I am sure the other entrees would be better."

/user_details?userid=-G2yLi-qli5HuXED-gY62A,Mark M.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Usually relying on reviews and how busy a place looks we were undecided, but the menu was so enticing we opted for this place for lunch. They would have received 5 stars if they could make a decent Bloody Mary. The food however, having the braised beef cheek, was delicious. The wait staff attentive and friendly, and the window seat on the quaint sidewalk is equally entertaining."

The food, the service, the decor - everything is top notch.The lunch menus are a great value for the money. At this location you can have a starter, a main course and coffee or tea for less than $20. Beautifully presented, fresh, delicious and served to the table.Really, get a table there and enjoy, instead of waiting in the line for the sandwich on the other side of the street"
/user_details?userid=c3_AdjAlMy4EJYQhuXADgA,Jason L.,"Charlotte, NC",4 star rating,Very relaxed atmosphere.  We had wine and shared a salad and a plate of ribs.  The ribs weren't too spicy and were pretty lean.  The weather was nice so they had the front windows open.  I would definitely visit again.
/user_details?userid=sqTsXCuMLB0yvBRka5Wsyg,Jim M.,"JFK Airport, Queens, NY",4 star rating,Had a lovely lunch here. Spanish/French cuisine was nicely represented with the seafood and vegetable lasagna dishes we enjoyed.  The Spanish red wine was delicious. The service was great and the waiter took extra care to ensure everything was to our liking.  Well done!
/user_details?userid=s6nIyADt_Xea5aPOG4Q7aA,Jaime S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Pretty solid place, food was good and the lunchtime pricing is slightly high but still acceptable. Definitely try the shrimp and chorizo risotto - though it's not as al dente as my favorite risotto dishes (since this restaurant is more Spanish French after all) the creamy saffron makes for a scrumptious experience. The mackerel was nice and fresh and kept warm in a extremely hot plate (wish they did that in all restaurants) that allowed you to leisurely eat your dish and have the food remain warm, though it didn't 'wow' me as much as the other Montreal restaurants I recently tried. Service was very attentive. Surprised not to see the place fuller at lunch."
/user_details?userid=8h1r7mXd-H225yDgc4EMPg,Sarah A.,"Pawtucket, RI",4 star rating,"Super excellent food in a great atmosphere! Definitely recommend the food here- the French onion soup was excellent as was a shrimp and risotto appetizer I had. Also enjoyed the fish. They also provide a really excellent bread basket with olive oil and balsamic. Cocktails were fairly good and I was impressed that the bartender came over to ask us about our cocktails and inquire about how they could be improved. Apparently, they've just updated their cocktail menu. The atmosphere is cool with a bull painted on the walls and open windows overlooking the street. Tables are a little close together but not too claustrophobic. The main thing that detracted from our meal here was that our waiter was very, very slow. Slow to take our drink orders, our food orders, bring requested items and bring the check. Don't come here if you're in a hurry, but rather if you want to linger over some unique, delicious food."
/user_details?userid=c6p1jJbmspGkApIbF8im8w,Mike W.,"McKinney, TX",2 star rating,"I will start with this was a very long meal.  The total meal took about 2.5 hours without dessert or coffee. Between seating and first real contact was approx 20 minutes.  Requested water with drinks and never received it.  Appetizer was the cheese plate, which we received 20 minutes after ordering. For dinner, we had the paella, mussels, and pork cheek. When the food was delivered, I received the salmon. When the pork check arrived, I ate after my family had completed their entrees. I will say the food was delicious, but the servers seemed overwhelmed and not able to handle all the tables.  Also, there were mistakes on the check when it arrived (wrong entree, charged for top shelf alcohol, when I ordered house) but I didn't want to spend the time to correct."

For entrees we had the lamb a couple, three different ways and each was wonderful. The pork and duck preparations were also outstanding.  Flavors were distinct and the vegetable pairings with the entree enhanced the overall flavor and enjoyment of each meal.  The wait staff was attentive and approachable. Jeremy is incredible, a very personable young man, but the rest of the staff was also supportive and always available.  They worked well as a team."

There is also a kids menu.
/user_details?userid=zkGhfguutpvffCSoXuyeHA,Brad C.,"Dallas, TX",2 star rating,"Return travelers very disappointed with this go-around.  I should have known when the Spanish speaking tourists we entered with were out in 30 minutes flat. The salad with goat cheese and fennel soared and really raised our expectations but the paella was a dry, reheated and flavorless disaster. I've always wondered how paella could be messed up. Come here and find out. My wife had a pasta dish with chorizo - red and bursting with flavor. The chorizo in the paella was dark brown, dey and cardboard tasting. The mussels scallops and shrimp, chicken etc in the paella were the same. Flavorless crumbling a frustrating and expensive waste of a meal.  Some people sitting outside Barroco made fun of my wife for going into this restaurant which is situated next door."

I walked in here by mistake when I was actually planning to go to a restaurant next door but this was a pleasant surprise.  I tried small portion shrimp/chorizo risotto and it was one of the best risotto I've ever tried. Highly recommended.
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First off, they are very lucky that I am strictly rating them on food and disregarding the service. The server was lost, gave us little information about the daily specials and was so quick to say how our party of eleven did not mention that we had a fix menu (which is false, how else would i have received the fix menu by email). They also have a $3/slice for cake cutting fee, insane. With that being said, the food made up for the lack of service. We went with the $40/person fix menu and it was a great decision. From the soup, to the eggplant appetizer, to the lamb main course and chocolate with melting center, everything was delicious! The lamb was so tender, literally just melted in my mouth, the stuffed calamari was a huge portion and the cod was so flavourful! I've never been a fan of fixed menus because i use to believe that the portions were small and you left still feeling hungry. Well that was definitely not the case here, I was soooo full and so satisfied with our overall meal. I highly suggest Les Pyrenees for a cute date night or a friends dinner. I had a great experience and would recommend!"

The staff are professional and provide top notch service. It was difficult to choose from the many tempting dishes on the menu. The pan crusted goat cheese with greens and strawberries was a perfect blend of crunchy, creamy, fresh and green and sweet. The vegetarian pasta was full of flavor with tender penne tossed with a sauce of tomatoes, red peppers, edamame, baby zucchini, mushrooms, garlic and more. The serving was 4 times what I could eat and I was starving.  The shrimp and chorizo risotto was divine!  So creamy and full of flavor, another large portion. The child's pasta with tomato sauce was wonderful as well. Fresh French bread, many wines (from a very nice wine list) by the glass, a perfect place for a wonderful meal.  Our only regret was not having room for dessert."

Kids menu was excellent! My son loves steak and the kids steak was perfectly done, better than most steaks I've had on adult menus in other restaurants. I had the fish of the day, Spanish mackerel, perfectly done with garlic in the slightly sweet sauce as accompaniment. My wife had the Quebec lamb shank. She's usually a light eater, but she finished the entire main course citing its flavor. Service was commendable, with a very friendly bilingual staff, and very accommodating to our 11 year old.

/user_details?userid=h4cduDwCH8K9LJrowoJraA,John G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We came across this place while waling through Vieux Port during the annual Formula 1 Street Festival. We were immediately attracted by the large paella that was cooking outside - it looked too good to pass up!This place is a bit touristy in an area full of tourist traps, so somewhat elevated prices come with the territory here. The décor is very nice, however, and bathrooms are kept clean even when very busy. Service varies from gruff to friendly, depending on who you get (we managed to get both at the same time!), but it is professional and experienced. The wine list isn't that deep or varied, but it suffices, I guess.We started with the chorizo and shrimp risotto - delicious! Properly cooked risotto with a perfect balance of saffron and chorizo, with some tasty grilled shrimp as well. Then we had the salmon with romesco sauce - perfectly cooked salmon with enough of the tasty sauce to mop up with the zingy mashed potatoes. I had the paella (it was the reason we came here, after all!) and it would have been fantastic if it hadn't been overcooked. Plenty of seafood - shrimp, scallops, mussels, very tasty chorizo, and chicken, all in a salty but delicious rice base, but sadly overcooked by quite a bit so all the seafood was hard. A shame, really, because it would have been so good ten minutes earlier. We finished with the bunuelos - cream puff donuts with a chocolate sauce - that were appropriately decadent and delicious.All in all, the experience was really good. They score 4 stars out of five due to the gruff service, weak wine list, and terribly overcooked paella. But I would be willing to give them another go because everything tasted so good!"

Looks wise, the restaurant is cute but that's all it is. The meal started off ok, we ordered a pitcher of sangria. We then ordered a plate of Catalan style tapas to share. I would give that a 6.5/10, it was decent but overpriced. Following was the seafood paella. It was very disappointing, tasted like it was from an Uncle Benn's microwaveable rice bag. During our meal we changed spots because there was a very loud group next to us, but that's beyond the restaurants control. After we payed, I was waiting outside for my boyfriend and our obnoxious french waiter came to stand at the door and yelled ""leave"". I'm guessing that was because a couple outside asked me if the food was good and I said ""it wasn't that great"". All this to say, just avoid this place. There are so many better places in old Montreal."

Today we bring family and friends to share the great cuisine of Catalunya Nord prepared by a Chef from Perpinyà. The first time we found this place, we were attracted, from a few blocks away by the Senyera Catalana (Catalan Flag) we decided to go in and give it a try!The staff was great, friendly, attentive accomodating and very aware of the ""Gluten Issue"" of our party! Any dish will bring the flavors of the Catalan Cuisine from both sides of the border. Paellas, Catch of the day, crema cremada (Crème brûlée) a medieval dessert originated in Catalunya is a great flavor to round up any dish!This place is not cheap. But you get what you pay for and it is worth every penny.   The selection of wine is good and have a couple of my favorites of the Catalan Torres Family Wines (Vilafranca del Penedès):  Tres Coronas (Ull de Llebre or Tempranillo grape) and Sangre de Toro (Garnatxa y Carinyena grapes) a great table wine to accompany your meets or even fish and seafood! We will be back!"

However, I was not very happy with the main course- as a vegetarian, I chose this restaurant since it has four vegetarian main courses. Unfortunately, there were only 2 options available for lunch, including the lasagna that I wished to try. I ended up with the Mille feuille, which was a quite bland (layers of boiled eggplant mixed with layers of cooked onions and asparagus). On hindsight, I should have checked before we all sat at the table. My friends who were non-vegetarians had much better options and enjoyed their meals. Best to check available options before you eat if you are vegetarian or vegan."

We were informed that only two vegetarian main courses were available, so we went with the Mille Feuille. Sadly we found it really really bland but didn't really have any choice as the burger and lasagna were not available when we went at noon.The orange cake was pretty decent, but didn't make up for the rest.Our friends who were non-vegetarian had a better experience, but we'd recommend that vegetarians stay away, or at least confirm what menu options are available before they grab a table."

I glanced through the broad glass storefront and saw pretty wine glasses sitting on a glossy wooden table with red chairs. A couple of guys were in back setting up, and when saw me peering in they waved. That was it! I knew I wanted a glass of wine there. And I wasn't disappointed. It's a lovely small restaurant with soft lighting and a casual vibe. Our waiter Simon had a little trouble with English but was so friendly that it was endearing. He had a wonderful sense of humor and took care of us very well. The three of us had the sea bass special, scallops, risotto with shrimp and chorizo, and field green salads -- all tasty and beautifully presented. The wine list was thoughtfully curated and we had plenty of help choosing. We even had dessert! The creme brûlée with orange zest was nice, but we liked even better the bit of almond cake with a swoosh of raspberry jam that came alongside it. The profiteroles with dark chocolate sauce and berries were spectacular -- I would have licked the plate if no one was looking. A sweet dessert wine came gratis. We didn't really care for it, but it was a nice gesture. This was definitely my favorite meal in Montreal. I absolutely loved the place!"

Three friends and I dined there last Saturday night after having trouble getting tables at other places. The first clue something was amiss is that the dining room was half empty at 8pm on a Saturday. This in spite of its charming old town location. The service was prompt and polite, the atmosphere was fine. That is where the happy dining experience ended. We ordered salads that seemed to have come from a corner store salad bar to start. One friend order some fries for the table. They were completely inedible brown, greasy. limp sticks of foul tasting oil. I had the paella, the house specialty. When I asked the waiter if it was a good paella his response was that they have been making it for 19 years. Looking back at that answer....well, you get it. I sent it back initially because it was lukewarm. It was returned to me somewhat warmer but far from the sizzling crusty bottom rice dish it should be. The rice was watery, flavorless. The chicken over cooked and there was a complete lack of the key paella ingredient, saffron. Another diner had the cod. It too came to her just warm. The waiter was polite with me and offered to remove it from the bill, as I didn't really touch it. We declined dessert. To sum it up; good waitstaff, terrible food. Avoid."

Don't be fooled like I was!If you have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it, why don't you just give it to me? I'll make you something! I swear it will be more delicious than what you eat here, and I've never even been to chef school. Notable: Place has nice bathrooms with nice-smelling mango hand lotion. Maybe stop in to pee on your way through Old Montreal? Unfortunately, that was the only notable thing about this place, other than the way-too-high prices. Oh, we also liked the free baguette w/ olive oil way better than our entrees. Shared some of the house red with my partner, which was fine. We came here because it was all that was open, we were sick of wandering around on a -30 day, and they had some veggie options on the menu.I would put the food at maybe a 1.5 or 2, but combined with the exorbitant price, it is definitely a 1. My partner had a pasta dish and also rated it as a 'meh', which was unfortunate since I think it was around $30, more expensive than mine. I got some kind of veggies put on top of each other like a leaning tower of pisa, and the smallest little lump of quinoa you ever did see. The side salad, also miniscule, was clearly made with the 'spring mix' you get from a box at the grocery store. It is smart to judge a place based on its salads - if the dish is more than $10, a box salad green mix is completely unacceptable IMO. The veggies - I would argue boring veg fare, as they are in like every single vegetarian dish made by people who do not understand how to do anything interesting with non-meat items - included zucchini, red pepper, and tomato, all of which were saturated in oil as to be almost tasteless. Sat way too heavy in my stomach, and way too little quinoa to help balance out the oil from the veg. Newsflash, just lopping excess oil on something does not make it 'gourmet.' Service was fine. I got leftovers in a take-away box but ended up throwing them out. (I NEVER DO THAT.) Couldn't bring myself to eat it. Too icky.Probably the worst value for dollar I have gotten in a LONG time."

It was a slow time and there were hardly any customers around. And the server never came around to fill our waters. Napkins weren't provided, and neither were we given knives to spread butter on our bread. The french onion soup was awful - it was way too salty, which basically made it inedible. One good thing was the saffron soup with mussels. That was delicious, but all the bads far outweighed the goods.Like I said before, this place is bad. Do not go here. There is a legendary and popular place just across the street called Olive and Gourmando's that always has a long line of waiting customers. We initially wanted to go there but opted for Les Pyreness because there was no wait. Well, that's what we get.

Solid wine selection and recommendation by server. The ingredients had more potential than the execution. I was dining on my own and the main course arrived lukewarm on a hot plate. The cooking could be better, but it was a good, complete meal, in a pleasant, relaxing environment. A family was celebrating a birthday at the next table and the server added a sparkler to the birthday girl's dessert without being asked -- nice  touch."

We ordered from the daily special menu which included a salad, a main, a dessert and coffee for 25-30$. Well worth the money. The service was fantastic. Finally a waiter who knows not to clear a plate if the other person is still eating!  Located on the fringe of Old Montreal, there is not the tourist crowd to contend with.I will go back for more."

A friendly and energetic waitstaff was hard at work taking orders, delivering drinks and food, and topping off water glasses. I had the gazpacho and chorizo w/ crevettes (the chorizo was folded into a delicious cheese, red pepper, and rice blend)...they were outstanding. My wife had the soup of the day (carrot) and the hearts of palm salad, which she loved. My two children split a kid's cheeseburger w/ fries. Dessert was a chocolate ice cream w/ strawberries and raspberries.  This wasn't your typical chocolate ice cream...it was better. The front window was wide open, and the fresh air made dinner delicious and invigorating. This was the best meal we had during our three say stay in Montréal. Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=0qs6DAP97Q2xf47ADd4prA,Jason D.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"This restaurant, serving basque cuisine on the border of downtown and old Montreal, is very popular among the crowd I find myself with in Montreal.  The food is good, but I had problems getting descriptions of the dishes from our server, and in fact, consensus at our table was that what he brought me probably wasn't what I ordered (but it was good, and I was kinda undecided anyway, so many things sounded good!).I really don't like the fact that they push the Sangre do Toro on people -- almost every table had it, and despite my protestations that it was a cheap supermarket table wine, our group got a bottle as our first.  When I picked something else as our second, everyone agreed that it was a marked improvement.The server also suggested the most boring-sounding dishes.  Between the food suggestions and the wine suggestions, I felt a bit like I was in a standard tourist trap.So the food -- 4 stars;  but the service attitude knocks off at least one.  By all means go if you're in the mood for this cuisine, but make sure you do your own work on selecting food & wine, and be ready to roll your eyes at the tourist treatment."

/user_details?userid=TUPWls9n9iXFRgHVg2FNMw,Matto A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Haven't had a great meal like this for a while. The stuffed chicken with mushroom and cheese sauce was absolutely amazing. It was bursting with flavors of garlic and other spices. The chicken was so tender and sauce, it was easy to tear apart. It was also very nice presentation wise and very appealing to look at. (I was afraid to eat it, than I might ruin it.) There is no doubt its on the expensive side, but when it comes to great food like this, I will pay what I have to. The service was a bit slow, but I understood that they were packed and busy. The servers were very friendly and talkative. In other words, it was definitely worth it.   Moreover, I strongly recommend this place for a nice dinner out."

We started with an anchovies pie - so different and delicious. I had a perfectly grilled cod fillet on a bed of the yummiest spicy chorizo and sun dried tomatoes on risotto.  My boyfriend had fisherman's stew - which had a ton of seafood in a beautiful broth. We were completely satisfied, and impressed with the originality of each dish.  We also liked how relatively inexpensive the meal was. There was no wait, but it was obvious the rest of the patrons were enjoying their meals also. I am glad we didn't wait in line somewhere else."

We stopped for lunch while riding our bikes.  We were not dressed as nearly well as the other patrons.  But Edwardo was very welcoming at the front door even with our 2 kids ages 9 and 11.  We felt out of place.  Since we eat fish and vegetarian not many places have lots of choices, but here they had plenty for us choose from.  My kids ordered the eggplant veggie lasagna and the goat cheese cake with veggies.  They loved it.  Our son Justin wanted to eat every meal there.  I had the mussels which was an incredible value. It was beyond a big bowl for $13.95! Edwardo took great care of us and made feel very welcome in our bike gear.  We would totally go back.  They really deserve a five star rating but Yelp likes to keep things real and favor 4 stars over 5 stars.  So I am trying not get this review filtered."

/user_details?userid=jiVOSL7OIu6d8Oex3zCC9w,Sionnan H.,"Pasadena, CA",2 star rating,"Stopped by here today, first day in Montreal,   at the suggestion of the concierge at my hotel.I walked into Old town, which is enjoyable. And did not have a hard time finding the place. The waiters were very kind and did not mind speaking 50/50 French and English with me. ( I am very rusty) I was seated promptly, and received bread, butter and my drink order pretty speedily.I looked over the menu, and decided to go with the tapas, which I was told included risotto, some stew, a (Spanish) tortilla, and a mini-open faced style tuna salad crostini. the waiter was pretty much correct, except, to my chagrin, the risotto with chorizo ended up being replaced with some sort of extremely unappetizing calamari. Points off for the inaccuracy of the dish description, and the indescribably bad, extremely heavy, overly spiced, strange textured calamari, which turns my stomach to think back on. The stew was fine, a bit tough, but good flavour. The tortilla was a bit over spiced too, actually (think too much liquid smoke) and the sort of ""tuna crostini"" that rounded the dish out seemed to have been sitting out for a bit.The positive was my $5 ""green salad"" was huge, and the vinaigrette had a lot of interest, not sure what they put in there. It brought out the happy Californian in me to see so many beautiful baby greens. And as I have said, the service was very friendly, and efficient. Strangely, the butter came in little single service plastic tubs, though, which seemed a bit cafeteria style, of such an otherwise trendy spot. Also, The sangria was decent.I will probably not go back, but that is not entirely the fault of the restaurant, it just seems there are better places around for the price. Would have loved to have tasted the chorizo risotto!"

/user_details?userid=9T1IY4IgByyLeuovlwS63A,Karen D.,"Jersey City, NJ",3 star rating,"Sometimes you end up at a place because it is just there. Maybe your blood sugar has dropped so low that even eating a cough drop can make the difference between a sane functioning person and a version of Jack Nicholson with an axe in the movie ""The Shining."" I wasn't quite at this point, but I was close. We had passed cafe after tourist filled cafe and then we turned a corner and there stood Les Pyrenees, kind of lonely on the street. Being about 2:30pm only two tables were full (not necessarily a good sign) but unless I got at least a glass of wine to tide me over I was about to become very evil. We stepped up to the menu and the Maitre D' swooped (literally) from inside and asked if we would like to come in. I know I was startled and we said ""not yet."" I quickly scan the menu - tapas, seafood, lamb...I can't focus...let's just go in, I need a piece of bread, quick. We were quickly seated next to the other two tables maybe they should have spread us out more to make the place look busy? (ok, I will stop nit picking). Anyway, the server stopped by our table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I couldn't get the word ""wine"" out of my mouth fast enough. Sensing my sense of urgency - the glass appeared almost immediately as did the bread. I had some random Sauvignon Blanc - but it was actually good and the bread and butter made me feel normal again. Having been to Spain, I was reluctant to order tapas in this location so I settled on Lamb (braised for 12 hours? I can't remember in my hypoglycemic stupor) and my brother decided on a salade, fish soup and shrimp risotto (as you can see I was so out of wack I didn't even order a salad or appetizer as is the norm for me). The salad was fresh (nothing wilted) and had a nice vinaigrette. The fish soup was also quite good, not too rich, not too salty, perfect temperature. Definitely hit the spot on a sunny afternoon. Now the plat principales were brought to the table and to my delight there was quite a bit of lamb. It was tender and well seasoned. My only complaint was regarding the unintentionally crunchy potatoes - just cooking perhaps 10 more minutes would have taken care of that. They were hidden under the lamb (perhaps where they belonged). The risotto was lovely, smooth, creamy, teaming with shrimp (and most important - not crunchy at all). This turned out to be the best risotto I had on this trip. We watched as they brought desserts to the next table - they both looked so delicious. Sadly, we did not partake in this course (and now I am regretting it!). This meal was solid and I thought the price was right. I like the ambiance of the place and we joked around with the wait staff and I had what I called a life saving experience in here. I had no complaints about the service, the food (except those darned crunchy potatoes) and my overall experience was very positive."

The sampling on one plate was more than sufficient.  The celery soup was watery without sufficient flavor. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce, although nice, lacked the warm smokey spiciness from espelette peppers.   The monkfish was nice, but the dishes seemed to be hit or miss.  We sampled five desserts and the presentation on two looked like they wiped off a chocolate dessert and put the next one on.  The creme brûlée was perfect, the orange cake was acceptable and the mousse was average.  Overall, I would expect better quality at those prices."
