I ordered food through doordash today from here for the first time, and I must say, I am already a fan of this place's food. I wish it wasn't pandemic now and then I could have gone there and enjoy the food in person. But this place did everything possible to make the best possible presentation of their food even if it was a take-away. As soon as we got the box of the biriyani we knew we are heading towards some awesome treat for the night and man we weren't disappointed. It was spicy and hot and we frequently had to add the raita that came with the biriyani. The raita was also unlike anything we have had in any other places. It reminded us of ""borhani"" a drink popular in Bangladesh. I am not from Hyderabad, so I don't know if they have similar drink .... but the taste is very similar to what we get in borhani that goes perfectly with this biriyani. Also, the portion was so generous! For just 10.99 CAD (doordash price), we had 3 large pieces of chicken inside the biriyani--- way more than enough the satisfy two people! We also ordered coconut chicken curry and it was equally good. Will definitely order more from this place and will be updating this review with descriptions of other mouth-watering menus this place has to offer! Until then chao!"
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We ordered take out last Evening for the first time from this restaurant and the food was so good. We requested the lady that answered the phone to make all the dishes spicy and she did not disappoint. I also requested for some plates and she was kind enough to send them with some plastic cutlery too. We ordered chicken chilli and requested to have real chillies and no bell peppers and it was fire! Loved it! Just like we would get in Bombay or in our favorite Indian restaurants in LA..so happy to find this place in Montreal! We also ordered lamb biryani and chicken dum biryani (steamed) and enjoyed both of them too.. very distinct flavors which was really good. The lamb biryani could have a couple of more pieces of lamb I feel personally but wouldn't complain if they kept it the same! Definitely gonna try more of their stuff!

We ordered the thali plates to try this place for the first time and were blown away. First of all the portions were crazy generous, way larger than any of the local spots. And the food itself was outstanding. They used real (not frozen) veggies! The ordering was easy and super fast and they threw in a free mango lassi. We will absolutely be back! What a gem!"
