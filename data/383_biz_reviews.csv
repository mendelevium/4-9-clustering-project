Due to delay of delivering me and my friend our meals, which make us late for our UQAM lecture about coronavirus management in late February, Ginkgo offered us free chocolatine and danoise in exchange of the wait time. This is amazing. When they delivered me my burgers, I found them particularly tasty: it must be the taste of joy and friendship! Thank you Ginkgo for the amazing dining experience!"

The atmosphere was very warm and the staff were all super friendly :) the interior is really what got me to love it because it's such an instagram worthy place!! The food was delicious; my and my friend we got the florentin egg Benedict which has spinach and cheddar cheese and it was soooo yummy like I'm not a big fan of hollandaise sauce but this one is bomb :) It was served with potatoes which honestly my favourite part but I'm also a big fan of potatoes (tbh who isn't) ahaha but I really think anyone would enjoy the potatoes just because it was flavoured really well :) it was served with fresh as well so u also got your daily dose of vitamins  I gave it 4 stars just because it took them a reallllly long time to give us the menu but also they were really busy so one tip is to reserve ahead of time :) Also brunch ends at 3pm and on their website you can reserve time till then but I won't recommend it because at 3 they close the restaurant and prepare for evening so if you do reserve I would say latest go for 2pm :) Overall I had such a great time here even though they took a while to give us the menu, the service right after was super quick and we got our food really quick too! So highly recommend this place if you're looking for a cute brunch place :)"

It's a nicely decorated restaurant with plenty of seating, and centrally located next to UQAM by Berri metro. I ordered the French toast which comes with a choice of meat and an almond milk latte in a bowl. The coffee was great; it was strong and warm and a tad more expensive cause they charged me for the almond milk substitution (we need to change that Montreal!). The meal was okay; it was actually kind of boring. They could have added some fruit to liven it up but nope, a few slices of bread and two sausages. At least it was eatable?! There are a few options for breakfast in this neighborhood so I can't say I'd come again, especially not for the food, but it's a great space to grab a coffee..."

The menu has some very nice choices and I'm for sure going to come back and try some more things. My cousin and I visited to have a catch up session and it was great! We sat outside, it was a beautiful day, servers were nice, and it wasn't crowded for a saturday morning. I ordered the plate that comes with mini crepes, bacon, two eggs, fruits, and mini potatoes. I thought the bacon was really good but the mini potatoes quite ordinary. I got a chocolate dip for my crepe which was an extra charge but it was worth it! I got my eggs poached which was a bad decision because without hollandaise sauce it just tastes kinda weird."

The service was also slow and we didn't get the best customer service experience. But food was okay, from a scale of 1-10 I'll give the half and half 8. Mimosa was also good. I would recommend for fast last minute choice."
/user_details?userid=CAgLPOjaWka_DSU2U6k8SA,Shuang W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"It is an extremely lovely brunch spot, the decorations are just on point and so trendy, the pastel colors made my day! As a tourist who sucks at French, I walked in there expecting there to be English menu, but there was none. We asked the server, and he barely speak any English too and he told my friend who understands French that since it's next to a French university they don't have English menu, I'm sorry but as long as u r not the cafeteria of the university this sounds like BS to me.  Also the service is EXTREMELY SLOW, and that same male server was so rude to us after that initial conversation and he literally ignored us, and even after we asked him to bring us the bill he never came back with it. Let's talk about food, after my friend taking forever to translating everything to me, we decided to go with eggs Benedict, I went with meat lover because I'm just into all kinds of meat, I also added spice to the hollandaise sauce, my friend got the demi Demi which is half eggs Benedict half strawberry banana Nutella waffles, isn't this just what heaven is made of??? Their smoothie is kinda disappointing, there are lots of giant chunks of fruits that were not blended all the way thru."

I ordered the omelette with asparagus, ham and cheese which was very good and not too heavy, it came with potatoes, fruits and a kind of applesauce. My friend who is allergic to gluten ordered a buckwheat crepe with fruits and was happy with her order as well.It was my second time at Ginko and I have to say, that every time the service is on point, quick and efficient and the portions are always generous. And of course, the soothing white of the instagram worthy decor helps to put you in a good mood... I will go back for sure!"

/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"I'd recommend this place for studying/getting work done as opposed to actual breakfast. The space is luminous and bright, sprinkled with leaf accents reminiscent of the restaurant name. It's evident that there was an immense attention to detail in regards to the restaurant interior. By far, one of the most beautifully decorated restaurants in the city.The food was overall meh. Nothing outstandingly bad or good about the breakfast fare. It's your typical breakfast fare consisting of everything from œufs bénédictines to waffles and pancakes. It's definitely a cute spot, don't expected to be wowed by the food. However, you're in for a treat if you want to stop by for a study break and take a peek at the inside of Gingko."

My colleagues and I went decided to work there for the day. Turns out instead of closing with their regular hours at midnight they were closing at 4pm. The least they could have done is write a message on their Facebook or online indicating a change of closing time. As for the food...one of my colleagues order a salmon bagel it looked pasty and a weird pink colour. Someone else ordered eggs Benedict both eggs were completely HARD BOILED! Although they were more than happy to replace the eggs, hard boiled is simply a basic no-no when it comes to eggs Benedict!As for me I ordered the meat lover plate ,comes with potatoes,2eggs,bacon,ham,sausage and apple sauce. The majority was good and filling but the apple sauce was had a tart like flavour,not pleasant.Killed it on the decor but the food needs to be improved tremendously."
/user_details?userid=ostGbH1mXyWYq1GE806Yug,Cara C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Went here for brunch, had the eggs florentine and shared a banana chocolate crepe. The crepe definitely was super filling, though was worth buying as a little splurge purchase on top of the eggs florentine. The florentine was great, and I also appreciated the large amount of fresh fruit (compared to the usual one slice of orange / one or two strawberries at other brunch places). The atmosphere and decor is also super cute!"
/user_details?userid=TyHP-hBXH6pZbPOACmnyKg,Vicki J.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Very good food! I ordered a strawberry mango smoothie that was very good. And I'm not sure what I ordered for my entree (since I can't read French) bc I pulled up pictures of what I wanted and asked my friend to find which one it was.... but I'm attaching a picture of it in case anyone else wants to be like me!!! Everything was delicious and I loved the potato pancake thing under the eggs.
/user_details?userid=k_lJBvGK7LDEXq5nklPIjQ,Del A.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"My friend and I (both huge brunch-lovers) were planning a weekend trip to Montreal and discovered this place through Instagram. We made reservations online for a Saturday morning (huge plus since brunch places can get busy quite fast and the worst thing is waiting in line with an empty stomach!) We walked in to a beautiful aesthetic - an open space with lots of plants and different tables (high, low, group etc) and were greeted by our lovely server. Their menu has a variety of options, from eggs benedicts, omelettes, french toast, crepes and waffles, so there's definitely something for everyone! My friend and I both ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict, that also came with some amazing hash browns and a fresh bowl of fruit. The only one suggestion that I would make is to tell the customers ahead of time that all of the breakfast platters come with a free drink (like coffee or tea) because that's an awesome bonus that we didn't know about until the bill came! Overall, a fantastic brunch spot with great service, an aesthetic space, and some great food - I would definitely come back again!"

I mean, a lot of restaurants messes up your orders or the service is terrible. But this place was on point! The drinks are very tasty and they have a great variety for breakfast. I had egg sandwich with french toast with fresh fruits and custard sauce. Wow, that was good!I'm definitely going back to try out something else."

The place was packed but we only had to wait 10mins to get a table for two people. I had their strawberry smoothie and their mix berries pancakes. It was DELICIOUS! Nice decoration/ambiance. Totally recommand this place :) N.B: better make a reservation if you are a large group.

Scroll down my Yelp timeline and Ginkgo's is it. We walk in and the place itself is so calming and charmingly decorated. Already like it (sucker for decor). We are early birds so there weren't many people in there which was super fine with us. The waitress was super friendly and explained the menu to us since we didn't understand French (still manageable to make out what items are). My order consists of French toast with strawberries and a side of potatoes (gotta have my sweet and savory). When this deliciousness got delivered in front of my face I went to town. And by this I mean cleared my whole damn plate almost wanted to lick it too. It was so fresh and hit all the right spots that I wanted to come back for lunch dinner and more! The potatoes were made so crisp with a zing of celery (new to me) and the French toast was just to die for. But you know what the cherry on top was? The bill! I couldn't believe the price we paid for this awesomeness of food. I was ready to drop $50 and more that's how good it was. This place just couldn't get any better. I did see that they are open late in the AM, which next time I'm in Montreal I will definitely have to check out what that's all about."

Great wait staff, patient with us non-French speaking tourists... menu was only in French, which was a small upset (many other locations had both English and French options)Interior atmosphere was modern, appealing and large amounts of natural lighting.

/user_details?userid=N4RFBwtIS3XVlw24BD0nJA,Sabrina M.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this place. When I went in there was no one there to greet me at the front so I just ended up seating myself. Many waiters just passed by me and I had flag down one of them to get their attention and ask them to bring me a menu. Upon receiving the menu I realized it's all in French (I'm visiting for Ontario) and so I asked for an English menu and was told ""use google translate"" - not impressed. Anyways, I used my grade 9 French skills to piece out certain items on the menu and placed an order. Food came promptly and was really good. I ordered a strawberry milkshake which came before my breakfast so I was able to sip on it while waiting. My main course was a bagel with salmon and fruit on the side. I was impressed by the serving size, especially the fruit on the side. The quality of the food almost made up for the service. I would go here again just because the food was good but I hope the customer service is improved for next time."
/user_details?userid=zJNHkZeGFuyjz472lmGNTA,Wilson L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We came here for a birthday brunch. It was terrible.I got a rotten grape (with literal black mold) in my eggs and fruit plate. The chef didn't even bother replacing the fruit that was in contact with the mold, just the single moldy grape vine.We asked for a simple substitution of ham for bacon for a benedict dish, and it was denied.The toast was soggy. Minor point, granted. Service was slow and clumsy. Our bills were mixed up and had to be redone several times.All this on a calm, third full restaurant. It would have been worth it if the food was good, but it didn't surpass the quality of a divey greasy spoon. It was not worth the near 20$ per head.But hey, at least the decor was bright and pretty."

Paid for bottomless mimosas for 22$ and the service was so slow we only ended up getting 4 in an hour and a half and it wasnt bush at all. Because of this we tipped them ~10% and our service didn't like this. She continued to go behind the counter and tell all of her coworkers and they all started at our table and gave us dirty looks. Horrible service.

Food is very good and you get so much for what you are paying, prices are very low. I had for breakfast a Poutine; basically breakfast potatoes, cheese curds and hollandaise sauce for only 6$, it's one of their unique item on their menu. Other the other hand, the coffee was not good.. very disappointing, couldn't finish my cup..  Overall experience: totally going to show up there again for another Breakfast Poutine."

We wanted to do brunch one day and found this place on yelp. It seemed right up our alley with bottomless mimosas and it looked adorable. Definitely lived up to our expectations and was probably our favorite part of our trip. We did the bottomless which was 20$/person for drinks and they did a great job of bringing you them throughout the meal. Really great menu as well, we had a hard time picking. I had the chorizo Benedict which was great and we got one of the sweet waffles to share for the table. The place was sooo cute as well; very ""instagram friendly"", we ended up being ""those girl"" and taking a ton of cute pics! Our server was great, most of the menu was in French and since none of us spoke French she helped explain everything and then even gave us recommendations for things to do in the city! Highly recommend!"

It's brand new and honestly, it doesn't even compare to what was here before! The Rose blush velvet seats are awesome and the plants make it an exotic place to eat. As for the menu, I had the veggie burger which was deliiiiiiicous! Honestly, I was filled and super happy with my food choice.The cocktail, on the other hand, was not even finished. (and I never leave drinks behind usually). I'm obsessed with watermelon drinks but this one was suuuuuper sour and not what I was expecting at all. Other than that, great place and cool staff."

Both were delicious, the portion sizes were enormous, and prices are very reasonable for a beautiful place like this.The atmosphere is excellent, the service is good. The potatoes on the side are top notch and the fruit bowl given with the meal made for an excellent palette cleanser after our heavy meals. I would certainly recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place is beautiful and very attractive. As we walked in, I immediately thought of a similar restaurant in New York called ""NOMO"" and that is what brought me to Ginkgo today. However, I must admit that the experience was not at all the same as the similar restaurant in new york. To begin, there was no wait and there was seating available, but it took someone about 8 minutes to notice that we were waiting to be seated. As we were seated, we had a look at the menu and they had lots of brunch options to choose from. Ordering was pretty easy, the horror came after. It took at least 35 minutes to recieve our food (we were only two). When we got our food, we asked for ketchup and our toasts and we had to wait at least another 5 minutes. The food was already cold and we couldn't enjoy the experience. As it went on,  I never got any refills of my coffee or asked if we wanted more toast (they only gave us two pieces). The food was nothing special or memorable at all. No one ever came back to see how we were doing and we had to ask the waitress for the bill. She never came back knowing we asked for the bill and we had to get up ourselves and wait for her by her counter. She would come back to her cash but didn't pull out our bill. She would just go on and serve her customers. After another 5 minutes, she finally got us the bill. Let's just say she got a crappy tip from us because since the beggining, she looked like she hated working there. For decor and music I give them 5 stars, but for service i'll give them 1 star and food 3 stars. Would I come back? Probably just for the decor, but not expecting much more."

Enjoyed the Demi-Demi for breakfast, which was perfect for someone--like me--who doesn't want to choose between something savory (eggs Benedict) and something sweet (a waffle with fruit and Nutella); I wish every menu had an option like this one! Breakfast potatoes were leagues better than most. Service was okay, but had a hard time getting a water refill (extra important when it's 35 degrees outside!)."

/user_details?userid=yH62JDvxOnE7ZdsMvDCi-w,Ariel M.,"Burlington, VT",1 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner, and at the time it seemed great! He got the bison burger from the menu and I got the pork taco. We shared an order of poutine, and he had a Latte L'Orange to drink. The bison burger was good, apparently, but halfway through dinner he started to feel sick. He thought it was the combination of the drink with his food. My taco was great, as well, and it tasted fine. The poutine had less gravy than I would have liked, which made it kind of dry. All together, that wasn't what spoiled the night for me.When we left, my boyfriend paid the bill, and only once we'd left did we realize we had been overcharged. We were halfway across the city by then, and he hadn't kept his copy of the receipt, so we knew it was unlikely we could dispute the $15 added charge. Additionally, in the restaurant the waitress kept coming over to us and speaking in French before switching to English, and it would have been fine if she had stuck with either language, but it gave the impression that she didn't really care about our understanding of her questions. The final kicker was the result of me getting food poisoning and being up all night vomiting alongside my boyfriend. The only thing we had shared the entire day was the poutine, so we suspected that as a culprit.Either way, for the experience we received and the overcharging for the food, we definitely would not go back. Ever. Count yourself aware that if you are a tourist, they probably will overcharge."

The aesthetic is very nice and feels pretty hip, with high ceilings and careful decorations. My friend and I both opted for the Florentine eggs benedict which was basically an eggs Benedict with white cheddar and spinach. The breakfast potatoes were REALLY good. I am a bit of breakfast potato connoisseur, and these were delicious. Very crispy with green onions and maybe a squeeze of lemon. It also came with a fresh fruit salad and a coffee or tea. I did not know that it came with coffee or tea and had ordered a tea, and when we saw the price of the breakfast not including the tea we informed our waitress who informed us that it was included, which was a nice surprise! However, I think they should advertise this. The price was very reasonable, and came out to just over $15 with tax for quite a lot of food and a drink in a very aesthetically pleasing location. Would definitely go again."
