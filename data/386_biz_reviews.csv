/user_details?userid=RmYwB_wUkpWbSWyxd3magg,Lauren S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,"Great food, the Summit sandwich was amazing, and we also had the grilled cheese with sausage. Highly recommend either, but if you love salmon, choose the Summit. The 4 (4.5 in my head) star rating was earned through the food. For coffee, I'd give it a 3/5, which is a bummer because we went there for that. The latte lacked flavor, because the milk dominated the drink. We also had a dirty chai, which was a little better than the latte. It was rich in spices, so if you love a tea-based dirty chai, go for it. If you prefer a sweeter powder mixture, or syrup, you'll want to skip this one."

There's a good amount of seating, although it appears to be quite a popular spot and can get rather filled up. The decor is loft-ish, but can get a little cramped inside as you try to move around the place. There's a pretty cool mural on the outside!I haven't tried the food there, but enjoyed the latte and the rose lemonade."

I came here to do some work, but the plug sockets next to me didn't work. The cafe was cold, and the lighting was dim and a little dingy. The atmosphere was pretty lacking, too - it was quiet and a little sad. I ordered tea, because everything else was sugary or had meat in it, and the tea was fine. I don't know, I just didn't really think it was that nice here. The decor felt a little industrial, the atmosphere was like a deflated balloon :("
/user_details?userid=9fe41Vmw245Eho1PghHHKw,Amy O.,"Hayward, CA",3 star rating,"I liked the vibe in this place, but everything else was spotty. It may have just been an off-day for them. I walked straight up to the counter to order as there was no line. I appreciated the pitchers of water (also, super pretty) they have for customers to serve themselves. Ordered cold brew coffee and one of the bagel sandwiches that they are known for. The cold brew cost the rate I usually pay; however, came in a very small glass and was mostly ice. The bagel sandwich took over 20 minutes to receive, and the bagel was hard. I couldn't even bite through it. The space was comfortable, and I can see why people come in. I'd give the bagel sandwich another shot, but definitely not the cold brew coffee as I got maybe 4 sips."
/user_details?userid=EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,Kevin K.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Alright - one of those things you learn from travel is that your assumptions and reality is often shockingly divergent.  When I say travel, I don't mean one of those silly package tours offered to Chinese tourists where you take 8 hours to get to a place, 30 minutes to gawk at some tourist trap, another 30 minutes to look at something else, spend the night at some cheap hotel at the suburbs, get the complementary breakfast, gawk at more stuff the next morning, 8 hours back and then call that a successful trip.  No, what I mean is that you pull a Mark Twain and go roughing it - 11 hour flight to Istanbul, 30 minutes to jump on the metro to an AirBnB in Fatih, visit the local Dia for groceries, hit the bazaars and merkezi to shop around.  Then hit the local lokantasi, kebapci or ristoran for food. You dictate your schedule, realm of interests, and ultimately, preferences in food. After a few days of travel, you meet a new friend or 2 and make some strident observations, i.e.:a) Istanbul is a modern European city but with a definite ancient underpinning.  Take Galata, for instance - the part of European Istanbul where the young educated moneyed urbanites go for their Espresso coffees and baguettes in the mornings.  When the government dug up the area for the M2 metro they kept digging up ancient Byzantine artifacts along the route.b) The Turks don't smile at strangers.  That is not to say that the Turks are not friendly nor hospitable - they are some of the nicest people that you can hope to meet, but they need warm-up time.  They are initially suspicious of strangers, which are similar culturally to the Koreans.  At most service joints all you can expect are curt prompt responsive service, but smiles are between friends and family only.  As my buddy Nacer would have put it - only hookers and weirdos smile at strangers outside.   c) Contrary to popular belief, everyday Turks drink black tea, not coffee.  Coffee are imported, while tea is grown on Turkish northern coast in large government plantations.   When the Turks lost their empire Ataturk set up tea industries as an exercise in self-sufficiency, and drinking tea became a beloved patriotic norm.  When you walk into a shop and negotiate with the shopkeep the social lubricant is a tulip shaped glass of amber-clear tea with a lump of sugar on the side.  That is not to say that coffee isn't popular, it is - It's just not as common as tea.  After all, the Turkish term for breakfast is kavalte, or ""after coffee"".  d) The kavalte of choice for Istanbulites depends on their wallet.  Workmen prefer Simit (a ring shaped bread topped with sesame similar to a bagel) with spreadable cheese, white collar workers prefer fresh pide (bread) with kaymak (Balkan style clotted cream) and honey, olives, tomatoes and cucumbers on the side, while the more well-to-do will gun for menemen (scrambled eggs with butter, tomatoes and sujuk (spicy lamb sausages) or pastirma (dried cure meats)) at a sit-down cafe.Okay, so that was about Istanbul.  But what about this cafe?  The infamous Rotisserie Romados is right around the corner and would steal their business via pasteis sales alone, and yet they survived 4 years - so it has to be pretty good, right?  The decor is minimalist and functional, very sleek.  The service...well, it's one step better than Simit Sarayi (a well-known Istanbul bakery chain), so it's officious without genuine warmth, so rather Turkish.  How about the food?Well, if you are expecting a loaf with kaymek and honey?  Nope.  No dairy does kaymek in MTL.  Menemen and sujuk?  Not on the menu either. You could get very good scrambled eggs with persillade, but that's about it. That leaves us with the Simit.  Their Simit is okay, but when measured up against the stuff sold on carts in Istanbul?  It feels more like a larger St. Viateur's bagel but minus the honey water dip.  It's also not served by itself but on a sandwich.  Kind of like a Beauty's special but by way of Galata.  The quality of food is solid, but it will not keep you up at night.  As for the coffee, that's straight up made with Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi, a famous coffee vendor out at the Egyptian bazaar at Eminonu (right across the Golden Horn from...yep.  Galata).  Usually done in a cevze, I would not be surprised if they use a Beko machine (Arcelik electric Turkish coffee maker). It's still a decent cuppa, with a certain spiciness to it.  Yeah, it probably has a shot of mastic in it.So yeah, if you want a taste of Istanbul, go to Istanbul (or Simit Sarayi).  If you want an idea of what an Istanbul breakfast would be like by way of Galata, well, there you go.  It's not bad, not unreasonable and has a modern touch to it.  I'll go back again."
/user_details?userid=Gf_tmJuE5s_xiUfENEq56A,Anita S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Love it! Great coffee, great Turkish food, great decor.  Its now easily one of my favorite coffee shops in Montreal and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal.  Great place to chill out.It was a cold and rainy day, after eating some delicious grilled frango at Romados we were strolling down Rachel.  We were this close to going into Cafe Neve but then we spotted Replika.  Hey, that place looks cool.  Yes!  No joke, probably the best espresso I had during this last trip to Montreal.  Really wished I had asked what they use for beans.  I didn't try the turkish coffee but the photos do look really cute. I've been to Turkey before, so I've had my share of Turkish coffee and well, it's not my cup of tea.I didn't try the food but it looked deliciousness.  If you like Greek or Lebanese food you'll love this.  As I said, I've been to Turkey so I was soooo tempted to try either the Burek or the Simit.  If you love Montreal bagels then you should definitely do the Simit!  The Burek is the Turkish version of Greek Spanikopita basically, just different shape.Love the idea of a trendy coffee shop to chill out, vintage Turkish decor with vintage photos, and well Turkish food - which is really really not that common in Montreal.Check it out!"
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have heard about Replika for a long time and know that it is a renowned Turkish cafe that is very popular on Plateau, but I find their coffee a bit plain. The interior decor is rather plain too, but I saw people coming in around 10-11AM and by noon it's very very hard to find a place inside the café. The café offers a variety of light lunch, including the Turkish bagel simit, which smells and looks quite good! I don't really recommend this coffee shop for studying and chilling because it gets noisy and crowded pretty fast. The mural of cats outside Replika is very unique, I love it!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On Rachel, West of St. Denis. Metered parking - use transit or walk.The space: I really liked this loft-like cafe, with its communal tables and roomy interior. It offers up a very casual vibe, with good tunes and plenty of day light. I also liked the funky art that was scattered throughout the place. The food: I ordered a Simit sandwich with black olive tapenade, avocado, tomato, sprouts. It was DELICIOUS. For those of you who don't know, a Simit is basically the Turkish equivalent of a bagel, but these are thinner and  lighter than your standard Montreal bagel. Having had Simit in Istanbul, I was pleasantly surprised at how bloody good these were. The clerk told me they make these in-house, so I guess that explains it. I also ordered the homemade lemonade, which was both refreshing and tasty. Service: Good. Not super friendly, but I think the clerk was a bit on the shy, quiet side.Price: Worth it. For $10, I got a huge sandwich and homemade lemonade. Verdict: Go. It's a great place to get a quick snack, chill out over a good book or to get a coffee with friends.  Also, they carry the same brand of Turkish coffee that I brought back from Turkey so.... BONUS!"
/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A nice third wave coffee shop with a strong Turkish influence and the place is hipster chic. I think it looks very good, but some might think it looks a bit bare bones. The food is either the usual coffee shop fare or Turkish food. The salads are usually very good, however, I usually stick to a Burek, which is amazing. Flaky, cheesy, savoury pie.The Turkish Coffee is a thick, deliciously black, smokey coffee. They can sweeten it with Matic sweets, which gives it a small woody flavour. The cappuccinos are also very good. This place is one of my favourite coffee shop in town.A very cool, but unnecessary note, the dishes they use are beautiful."

I am loving my cafe adventure, no doubt wanted to add Café Replika to my list!I knew they served food and made sure I am here for that. Oh students, students all around in December, filling up every single cafe. For the poor coffee lover that is me, it's really hard to find a seat and enjoy my cup in peace! Nonetheless here at Replika, people come and go, lots of students in December, but I managed to secure my little spot. Where people kept dragging my jacket down when they walk pass. That didn't bother me.There is one single washroom, a little gross. That didn't bother me.The food is gooooooooooooooood. The service! There is service here!! She will bring your cup to you. The coffee is gooooooooood. So are the baked goods! I prefer the bagels though. I loved the generous smoked salmon, which is Smit Sandwich 1. It's a toasty and tough sesame bagel (teenie sweet at the top) loaded with smoked salmon and leaves. It sounds weird but was filling!"

/user_details?userid=kgAiyUPCeemokjHOOBa6_g,M M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,A beautiful coffee shop in the plateau with a really good vibe. I tried my first Turkish coffee here and it was quite amazing. They also have some really appetizing freshly baked goods. Definitely coming back here again. I'm quite tempted to try out items from their food menu next time.
/user_details?userid=DSFJIs5J1xp8l_fBpUydDw,Sanam A.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,Cute cafe in the plateau. The barista was friendly & chatty. Prices were on par with other independent coffee shops in Montreal. I tried a Turkish coffee - first time I'd seen it on the menu in a Montreal cafe. It was served in a cute cup. I wanted to try their simit but it looked more like a bagel & I had already started the morning with one at St Viateur on my walk over. The coffee shop gets pretty busy & the tables are very close together; it was sometimes hard to focus on my conversation over the noise. I liked the mural outside too.
/user_details?userid=bf9IQYcUhIsPapOt6g1WpQ,Kristine F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5 star rating,"This is a cute little coffee shop in Montreal. When we were visiting Montreal, my sister and I woke up early for a walk to Parc La Fontaine. We've heard of this coffee shop, and we passed by it on our way to the Parc. On our way back, we ordered coffee and an open-faced bagel sandwich. It was so delicious!It's an interesting place: very modern, with an minimalist-industrial design. Yet they serve Turkish coffee in the traditional method. Their sandwiches are also a fusion of Mediterranean/European/Asian flavors, while incorporating North American food items like bagels! :)I wish I were in Montreal so I could go again!"

It's in a beautiful corner space, with lots of natural light inside. The décor is simple, with muted colours and an industrial feel, with a comfortable couch by the window. It's a nice relaxing space. I got a latte and a simit with smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, tomatoes and lettuce. The simit was perfect: a lightly toasted bagel with ample ingredients. The lettuce was extra fresh, which added the necessary crunch to the sandwich. It was delicious. I savoured every bite of my breakfast. If I lived in this city, this would definitely be one of my regular stops!"

It's super strong and bitter but I'm used to Italian espresso so everything will be alright.

I just grabbed an americano and studied here. Their chocolate chips cookies are amazing; they are super gooey and crunchy on the outside while being soft in the inside. I do want to try out the food that they sell there next time. There is seating outside of the cafe if you just want to grab a coffee and go.
/user_details?userid=si7PDh4blAry09r27oZLrg,Isabella B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went specifically to this place to try the Turkish coffee- I make Turkish at home and was excited to see that a coffee shop in Montreal also makes it. I was so disappointed. It was probably the worst Turkish coffee I have ever had. Made from an automatic machine and there was more coffee grains stuck at the bottom of the cup than there was coffee to drink. (typically some grains at the bottom is great but there were a good two inches here. The coffee was probably not ground fine enough, or maybe because it was made with a machine). More than anything, it tasted burnt. Also had a really tough time communicating with the barista. She was sweet but we had trouble in both French and English so it was confusing. However, cute atmosphere, and thankfully I was thirsty enough to try the homemade almond milk latte, and it was the best almond latte I've ever had. Espresso was a bit salty, but that's what Old School tastes like. It was the perfect milk that did it for me. I'll be back for that one, craving it already."
/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I believe this is the only place in Montreal that serves Turkish coffee. I've never had Turkish coffee before so I didn't know what to expect, but the barista was very helpful at introducing me to their menu. I ended up going with the Turkish coffee they served (after all, this is what this café is known for). I also ordered one of their apple pastries.I was told to have a seat and that they would serve it to me. I'm used to just picking up my coffee at the counter so this was a pleasant surprise. I think out of all the cafés I've visited in Montreal, this would be one of the few ones where I could actually get some work done and not be distracted by excessive background music. Its interior  actually reminds me of the loft from ""New Girl"" in a way. This coffee has to be one of the richest coffees I've had and lies more towards the bitter spectrum. There was a layer of coffee grounds left in the cup after I finished, but after a bit of research, apparently that was common for Turkish coffees. The apple pastry was a nice contrast to the bitterness of the coffee. The cups they serve the coffee in also adds to the fanciness of the drink. I would recommend everyone to try out this place. Definitely not your normal cookie cutter café."

I just pointed to Replika (thinking it was a bar or coffee and dessert shop) and said ""I'M DONE WALKING. WE'RE GOING HERE.""Well, this was a stroke of luck! Since we are vegetarian, we ordered the Simit 2 (see another Yelper's pic of it!) and we loved the turkish bagel and the olive tapenade with the avocado! What a perfect mix! I have been craving it ever since and want to try to make my own version of it here at home (I now live in California.. so can't easily come back here to eat)We also had the blueberry roll which was delish. I should have tried their turkish coffee along with it!They also have free wifi, the code is on the board next to the register.Loved the decor and chill vibe here."

/user_details?userid=LmFDJ66sqIc0AdOMZHWfbA,Bengisu K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It is a lovely place, whether you want to study or watch outside while nursing a cup of coffee. I like their espresso beans and drinks; their Turkish coffee is alright but nothing great--though given how rare good ones are found in the city, I guess if you really want to have Turkish coffee in Montreal, it is one of the best options you have. If you're having coffee, I'd highly recommend getting at least the tahini roll. I'm suspecting it is homemade because it truly taste like homemade ones my aunt used to make; its dough consistency is somewhere between the bread kind and the cookie kind and is thus best of the both worlds, quite filling as a snack too. Their food is generally very good; you won't go wrong with any option. My personal favourites are their boreks; they use a lot of filling which makes it hearty and delicious. For any Turkish foodies out there or those who are big on 'simit'; their simit isn't really the authentic simit, and more like a simit-bagel hybrid. Still, even if a bit fudgy, it is a delicious one. Despite being hardcore about my simit I still love to get theirs if I'm there in the morning; perfect breakfast."

I love the discovery of entering into a place and feeling the vibe of its patrons. Is it crazy boisterous? Is it laid back? Is it soulful and relaxing? Is it a student vibe? Is it a creative incubator for ideas and chilling out? Cafe Replika had that quiet chill coffeehouse vibe when I entered it where patrons were chatting in a low hush and working away on laptops while having brunch, snacks and coffee based beverages. I stopped on by chance of walking down the street and was happy I did. As I was in a rush I ordered a Turkish coffee to go. Maybe I didn't wait long enough for the grains to settle but it was a bit grainy as I sipped it. Probably more my fault but was a nice potent serving and slight but not overbearing acidity. Overall a good zip up for the afternoon. Montreal has many superb coffee shops serving local food and unique coffee and beverages. This is definitely one!"

We ordered a smoked salmon bagel sandwich and a beet, hummus and avocado bagel sandwich. These were delicious. One of the best smoked salmon bagels I've had thus far in the city.

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It looks like Café Replika has joined the company of Chez Boris as being my favorite cafes in Montréal (and hopefully counting). I always tend to have a thing for cafes that come with a regional flair, with specialities that come from their respective countries as well as the typical offerings that come along with the traditional coffee shop. The presence of actual savory items on the menu doesn't hurt either. Café Replika has all of these plus an open layout with quiet but active surroundings, providing a good place to eat, drink, and catch up either with schoolwork or a friend.Since I hadn't eaten at all the previous day (don't ask why), I decided to order the Simit #1 (which is basically a smoked salmon bagel sandwich with a traditional Turkish round bread base, so similar enough to a Montréal bagel), a peanut butter cookie, and a Turkish coffee with mastic. I was a bit hesitant on ordering the coffee with mastic at first, since the barista told me that mastic is kind of a licorice-like sweetener (and I detest licorice), but I decided to wing it and give it a try upon further convincing. Once I took my first sip of it, it was immediately clear that there was no going back - it was arguably one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. The brew was very strong and bold, but it was in such a way that made you savor each sip and all of the sensory elements at play, with the subtle tones of the mastic as the icing on the cake. I also loved how they served it in traditional little cups that were super cute and forced you to take your time with it. Although the coffee was a star on its own, the accompanying food also exceeded my expectations. The simit sandwich was so flavorful and I actually loved the base and thought that the hardness of it actually held up the fillings very well. The people running this place definitely know how to take such standard and traditionally-done things to the next level. And the peanut butter cookie, which basically had a hole filled with oh-so-rich peanut butter in the middle along with oats mixed into the dough, was quite possibly the best that I've had. By the time I was finished with everything, I didn't want it to end.I will definitely be back to try some of their other things as well as whenever I need a super good cup of coffee! Café Replika on its own is one of the reasons why living in the Plateau is 100% worth it, and it is sure to exceed your expectations."

This place is cool...like too cool for school with its industrious chic furnishing, grey tones and high ceilings. Next up: what's a simit? A quick Google search tells me it's essentially a Turkish bagel. When in Montreal, I say, throw carb caution to the wind and eat all the damn bagels.We snagged a small table in this communal-like space of a cafe where quiet Sunday brunchers dined and students hustled nearby. Though mostly quiet, a mix of French and English conversation could be heard in the din; it's an agreeable atmosphere for work and leisure. I ordered a simit with avocado and tapenade (sans goat cheese), beet soup and a soy cappuccino, which I heartily enjoyed. While the beet soup was too tangy/chunky for my liking, the simit was dreamy. I am never a graceful eater and this bagel sandwich challenged me, but I was determined to finish the very last bite. Three napkins later, some avocado lost onto the floor, and I was quite sated.Cafe Replika: Simply good food and coffee in a great space. Definitely will visit again!"

Very strong and they suggested putting a little bit of sugar to make it sweet but I think I'd prefer it without sugar. I also had their borak, very yummy! It's a turkish pastry I believe, with spinach and feta cheese. Their usual americanos are good too! It's in a great location and there's a BIXI station right across the street too!"

The vibe is laid back, most people come here with a book or their laptop and the place tends to be pretty quiet.The coffee is great and so is the food! You MUST try the salmon bagel - sounds so simple and classic, I know, but you'll understand what all the fuss is about once you taste it. You're welcome.Staff is OK, not super friendly but polite. The coffee and food alone is enough to keep me coming back."

I really just happened upon this little place out of nowhere. Tired of biking, and needing a mid-morning break, I parked the Bixi and this oasis appeared! With Intelligentsia coffee?! WAT?! This place is seriously made for working. When we walked in, every single person (10-15 people) was working on a laptop at their table. And they have quite a menu for a light lunch. I'd stop here again anytime."

We also had the Turkish coffee, which reminded me a lot of traditional Ethiopian coffee. I had mine with a bit of sugar, even though I normally drink my coffee black. I really enjoyed the coffee, it was unique and not too strong. The cafe has a nice interior, lots of seating, wifi, and a Bixi station nearby. A great place for meeting up with a friend, reading, or studying!"

/user_details?userid=lVf6y-L1cflXcUfhvTFuSA,Ashley Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I fell in love with this Turkish cafe during my first visit! Cafe Replika just opened this August and it's located 10 minutes from Mont Royal Station. The cafe is very spacious and it has a great ambiance. Their drinks menu is relatively cheaper than the ones in downtown. Replika is owned by a Turkish couple called Ceren and Ozan and they are really nice and happy to answer any of your questions regarding the menu etc. What's so special about Replika is that it serves Turkish food and everything is homemade! The other specialty is their Turkish coffee and they source their coffee beans from a roaster at St Henri. The Turkish coffee comes with a Turkish delight and it's super delicious. It makes me coming back for more ;) I also had their homemade blueberry roll and it was crispy and not too sugary. It's usually very quiet in the cafe and it's the perfect place to spend the afternoon with a book and coffee! :)
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is such a wonderful little cafe! I was intrigued by the fact that it is a Turkish cafe.  Only ever having had Turkish coffee at friends' homes, I wasn't sure what to expect, and was delighted to find it just as good as the coffees I've had in the past.  They must put a lot of love into what they do.All the goodies on display looked delicious, and I will definitely want to try them out on future visits.The space itself is super comfortable.  Stylish in a relaxed way, a mashup of church basement chairs and vintage chic sofa, perfect for hunkering down to do some work solo or have a discussion with a pal.  There's a buzz about the place, without being particularly loud or too quiet.  It was just right."

I like it for its good coffee and light meals, its inviting, well-lit space, and the super cool staff that's not even making an effort to be but just are. However, every time I go there, I remember how much the constant hum from the fridges annoyed me the last time. Do try their food, you'll love it."
/user_details?userid=QRIzeHyThRsY6_N7r4A4tw,Shaw T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my third visit in under one week and the reason? - Simit #3. A sweet beet and pb hummus spread over a sesame simit with slices of avocado and beautiful kale curls. Havent tried anything else, but the ambiance is very chilled and it was surprisingly quiet all three times i was here despite it being virtually full, which makes it perfect for working or reading. Very sunny."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Café Replika served fresh and delicious salads and sandwiches at a reasonable price. With a super balanced but very small seasonal menu, this café scores high. The coffee was more than decent too."
/user_details?userid=btkknX6aSfx5xCnsKKzOCA,Liliana C.,"Cambridge, MA",4 star rating,"The simit sandwich and the tahini cookies were not overrated. My girlfriend ordered the limit just with feta and was a little disappointed, though. The sandwich with all the toppings (avocado, olives, etc) was definitely where it was at. If you're in the mood for something fresh-tasting and delicious, do it up!"

/user_details?userid=2aWnt5QkGigX-MiYi0SNTA,Peter C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lots of good to like here.  The space itself is well thought out, plenty of seating, a few nooks to hide out more, individual tables for when you want that, and a sofa area for that vibe as well.  This cafe serves good food for a great price, something hard to find in Montreal.  The coffee part is sufficiently on point I'd come here for the coffee itself.  The music they choose to play is often good enough for me to not even need to listen to my own, this is especially true when the music being played is from tracks picked by one of the owners.  The baristas are quite friendly, and I love chatting with them.  Great way to practice your French, and simultaneously build a sense of community.  The only main downside is their hours, closing at 6 is a bit early for Montreal."

It doesn't matter because I obviously had nothing to complain about because... all I can remember is how my mind was blown from the tahini roll. The 4 stars is for the tahini roll and beautiful space. There will be a next time.
/user_details?userid=NXe2TNLx1iULACr2xXvSIQ,Elliot M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This is a wonderful café! There is lots of table space which is nice and somewhat rare along Rachel (compared to Névé for example). Coffee is great, especially the Turkish coffee of course. Delicious and affordable food and snacks. Easy to eat and grab a speciality coffee for under 10$ which again is so rare in MTL. Meat is halal which is a plus for haloodies and very much appreciated given the spartan landscape for halal eats at cafés like this! Highly recommed this, hard to find much better anywhere in the city across the board when looking at quality, spaciousness, vibe and price."
/user_details?userid=xQC-G-9bxyXEsy-GQ-UTEw,Stephen R.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Replika has been open for several months and I am surprised more people have not discovered this lovely spot. While many independent coffee shops in Montreal are  super small and crowded, like Cafe Neve down the block, Replika is spacious and open with ample seating and work space. They have a delicious array of homemade sweet and savory snacks, tea and coffee, too! This is definitely a great place to grab a bite and do some work on a cold winter's day."

Hands down, no holds barred, a definite 5/5. But there is something more to this cool Cafe: the food - it's unique, its fresh and home made, and most importantly it tastes incredible. If only Yelp would let me, I'd give Replika a 10."

I knew immediately that I liked the atmosphere but it was after ordering that I knew I would be coming back! First off Nutella brown butter chocolate chip cookies. I will only say this, there is a god. I leave the rest to the imagination. The other baked good are also delicious.The food is really tasty, a small and simple menu but something for everyone. As a vegetarian I had no problems!The coffee is perfect, chai latte superb and nice teas. All in all wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food, wonderful drinks and a charming hostess!"

Excellent tasty foods, mezze's, greens, fantastic gourmet coffee... Within a big, open, stylish, calm area. That is a good destination to perform or perhaps analyze, beautiful tranquil setting, excellent wi-fi compatability, public or perhaps independent dining tables. Recommended to try."

We came by late in the afternoon,so there wasn't much left. We ended up ordering what was in the fridge at the counter. A bean salad with red onions and another salad:broccolini with chopped hazelnuts,in a very tasty vinigrette,as well as a bourek....Turkish-style spanakopita,followed by black tea for me and a green tea for my friend.The broccolini salad was just scrumptious,the bean salad reminded me of refried beans; not my fave,the bourek..very good and not at all greasy,which I expected. The waitress confused our tea orders,but no matter,had the green tea instead ( the new ""health food""). Another keeper."

They are all delicious but the squash soup, borscht, and turkish village soup will have you clapping. Also they make borek which is like a turkish version of spanakopita, and it is better than any greek version I've had in Montreal.Get there and get yourself some turkish coffee, son."

Of course there is wifi!"
