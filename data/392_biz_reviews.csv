/user_details?userid=VS19G7pF6tAjzbYiAAsdGA,Tessi C.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for a big birthday party - most of our first time and I'm literally giving four stars SOLEY because of our incredible server, NELSON. We were greeted and seated nicely as we made reservations. Nelson poured us drinks and was VERY attentive to our table - checked on us so often that it felt like we were the only group he was serving (maybe we were haha!) but it was seriously amazing. Our dinner came right away which was impressive but okay let's talk about the food.. Mediocre. For how expensive it was, the food wasn't up to par at all. The steak was tasteless and dry despite it being medium rare. Normally I could finish a steak dinner but this was definitely one of the rare occasions where I left nearly half of it for my fiance to finish it and he didn't even bother. The interior.. hmm. Okay, for a place known for being ""boujee"", the walls were breaking up and so were the sofas.. Cracks on the wall, paint job was peeling off and the leather of the sofas were coming off.. I mean.. with how much money it costs to spend time here, renovations even the slightest ones should be made. Buut the restrooms.. holy F how cool were they LOL! They were so beautiful and the chandeliers and all that for a restroom was actually insane!! So neat!!Now Nelson. When we ordered bottles, he came through right away. He even offered the guys if they would like girls to join our party! Hahah he was soo nice and going beyond for us. The most shocking, most touching part of his service? After his shift was done around 1am, HE CONTINUED TO SERVE US FOR TWO MORE HOURS. He said ""no it's okay, just want to make sure you guys are okay"" I HAD TO FORCE HIM TO GO HOME!!!!! We were sooooo thankful for Nelson, UNREAL. Never in my life have I seen a server go the length he did to accommodate our evening, for one of my best friend's birthday. Management of Bourdelle, please acknowledge Nelson in his work for this place. The only way we would come back is if we were sure to have him be with us again. The nicest, most genuine gentleman!!!! Thank you guys!"

I finally managed to convince my husband to take me here to this raunchy and sexy Place it was a wild yet wonderful time!Ambiance: quite elite and entertaining... the place is fabulous and really caters to a higher end clientele.. 25 and plus.Service: impeccable!!! The moment you enter wether you decide to arrive by foot , uber/ bus/metro or car you are definitely in for a fabulous treat and experience. There's Valet service which was super convenient but we decided to stay at a hotel near the area so we can just uber and order all kinds of drinks and dance the night away!!! We didn't want to worry about driving back either with a few drinks in our system.The coat check was ready to take our jackets for free and handed me a beautiful rose for Valentine's day yaaay.. they greeted me with such kindness and definitely made me feel important!We came here for Valentine's day and they had their table d'hôte menu (69$) only and the regular menu was out of the question.. nonetheless, the menu was fantastic.For starters We had a complementary sparkling wine glass eachPaired very well with my fish starter I had the organic salmon tartare with avocado guac and a pretty delightful heart crouton on top 5+++++/5 it was delicious and was very impressed with the portion size Fresh succulent and was in a euphoric moment with this dish alone.My husband went for their Caesar Salad with prosciutto and parmesan it was alright he did say he wished he had what I was havingMy main was an upgrade so I picked the seafood platter dish for an extra 25$ + 40$ for an extra dozen oysters as you can tell We loveeee them and they're known to be an aphrodisiac.. guess you know what that means ;) yeaaaa perfect for Valentine's day ahaha The platter came with 18 oysters, Royal Alskan King crab, a whole lobster declawed and cut open for us, and 2 jumbo shrimps wawawawawa I was amazed loved the platings .. it came with 3 different sauces : ( Garlic butter was my fave, the prosseco red wine shallot vinegar was my hubby's fave and the other one was salsa/ shrimp tartar sauce .. All I used was the Garlic butter it was amazing)Husband had the Solo Hawk Steak He asked the cook to be Charred and as per requested he got it .. we shared everything and everything was amazing the truffled mushrooms were to die for wooow and I'm not a steak fan but boy oh boy was I so pleased to have a bite of that steak it was cooked to perfection and super delicious.Desert : only one choice was a deconstructed cheese cake with strawberries and macaroons mmm my plate was completely devoured.The place turns into a crazy party around 10:00 and we had beautiful ladies entertaining us throughout the night in their cabaret / Bordelle outfits ;) And to be honest this was the nicest vibe and best Valentine's day I ever experienced with the husband felt really nice to dance and experience something way more different than a usual dinner seating. It was fun and service was nailed perfectly Overall, I definitely recommend this place for any type of event if you're into this type of scene very vegas type / European laissez faire and raunchy feel.. it was hot literally and metaphorically.. loved the experience totally recommend..."

Not much parking near the restaurant but they have free valet parking. Which is super nice.We did not need it as we booked a room at the embassy suites review to come as we don't believe in drinking and driving.From the minute you walk in you are in a wow factor and you know the rest of the evening will be amazing. The vibe you get and the way the staff greats you; you just know Thé place is decorated in the theme of an old school new burlesque vibe. From the uniforms to how it's set up it all works wellFood we shared allAppetizers  We shared the salmon tartare and spicy Cesar salad Salmon tartare was to die for. Cut perfectly and seasoned excellent. Super fresh and chilled to he right temperature.Spicy ceases salad was just ok.Portion was small and did not get the spicy kick as advertised. Next time I would try something elseMainsSeafood tower and tomahawk steakSeafood tower plus extra oystersHad full Lobster, 18 oysters, Alaskan crab legs, shrimpsPresentation was excellent, the quality of the seafood was super fresh and prepared with care.Nothing was overcooked or chewy. Just fell out of the shell, tender and juicy SteakI love steak and I eat steak only onewayRare with a outside charI asked the server to confirm and she went and asked the chef . She came back in a few minutes and said the chef could  do it .The présentation of the plate blew us away.The steak was cooked to perfection. Beautiful outside char with a nice rare inside. The n'est was so tender and was hard to share. LolIt came with a few sides; mushrooms; asparagus; and lobster mashed potatoes. All with nice flavours and cooked rightDésertWas a deconstructed cheese cake ;Because I was a bad boy at dinner I did not eat the desert but was wife said it was simple okAll night long they had little burlesque shows.Done with taste and class  If you want good food and entertainment then this is the place to go."

Otherwise pretty cool vibes all around.Food: my salmon tartare was very bland, and my  garlic and chives mashed potatoes was very salty. My old fashioned cocktail was full ice than drink itself; nice touch to my cocktail by a smoked s'more. Desert wise, we tried a giant cookie blueberry ice cream; the cookie almost burnt my tongue, and it was overloaded with sugar, thankfully it was balanced with blueberry and vanilla ice cream. Price: overpriced for the small portions.Overall it's a fun place, if i go back ever, it will be just for drinks and the show."

Our waiter was pleasant and super attentive.  We sat at a table because we wanted to eat but make sure you reserve a table specifically, otherwise you might need to stand at the bar, which doesn't come with chairs. Although they did bring out bar chairs for a number of patrons.We ordered cocktails at $7 and had 6 of the $1 oysters for starters and they came out of the kitchen really fast! I really liked the freshness of the Cool Cucumber. We had mini burgers, Cesar salad and salmon tartar. When I asked our server if I could have a few more taro chips with the tartar, he brought me a plate with a few more! Overall cool venue, great energy and the staff we interacted with were all really nice.  Some of the plates they used were just so pretty!  Food was pretty good for the 5@7 prices so I wouldn't mind coming by again! Nice place to unwind after work.It does get a bit noisy towards 6:30ish as the place fills up."

/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is gorgeous. Went there on a Friday night, the music was great, the drinks were good, the bartenders were nice and helpful. The place isn't too small so you have space to dance with all of your friends. They have impressive stunt women performing every 30-40 minutes in the bar and even the DJ is a woman which I enjoyed seeing since that barely happens.My only issue with this place is how slippery the floor and stairs to get to the bathroom is. If you are wearing heels (which you most definitely are if you are at Bord'elle), it is absolutely HELL to go down these stairs, even worst if you've had some drinks. Please, do something about this.Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place for clubbing"

It was unique with girls performing acrobatics while you were eating and some stage dancing. It  was pricey though food a app and dinner was well over 100.00.

Every place I tried during my visit to Montréal was beyond amazing except this one. I really wanted to love this place. The restaurant is gorgeous but my experience was not good at all. The service was horrible. My girlfriends and I had a reservation and upon arrival we were seated at a table right in front of the entrance. How do you expect guests to enjoy their dinner when it's 30 degrees outside and you keep opening the door?!  I'm truly not exaggerating. The hostess's even had on their coats!  We asked if our table could be moved but we were told there weren't any other available tables. Management should definitely consider adding a curtain or something to prevent their guests from leaving due to weather conditions. Our server made the experience even worse with his rudeness and bad attitude. Against our better judgement, we went ahead and placed an order for a charcuterie board and drinks anyway, but after finishing we decided not to stay for dinner. The server became even nastier after we requested the check. The overpriced drinks are barely a 1 oz pour. We were so over this place. We went back to the restaurant that we had dinner at the night before which was La Champagnerie and ordered bottle service and had an amazing dinner."

We lucked out by grabbing a last minute reservations at this hot spot! You are greeted by a gentleman outside, velvet rope and all and directed to the beautifully vibrant and decorated inside. My husband and I were both very hungry so we were recommended to order the chefs selection which is a huge perfectly seasoned  tomahawk ribeye, a whole lobster, crab legs, shrimp, delicious grilled veggies all on top of heavenly lobster mashed potatoes......we didn't order any appetizers because as you can see our meal was huge! It is meant to be for 2 people (very hungry people) but can be shared by more with other entrees or apps. As we were recovering from our massive meal the lights dimmed down a bit and a burlesque dancer came out and entertained dIners. It was pretty cool. I'm sure some people might find it uncomfortable trying to eat while having exposed body parts dancing around. We were told the restaurant turns into a complete club after a certain hour. I'm pretty sure it's pretty awesome. Hopefully we will stay for that next time around!"
/user_details?userid=g3lxPe-gd8KTDeyPMmTY4Q,Lisa H.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Three words: watered down drinks. Came here with my girls to celebrate one of the nights for my bachelorette.  It was during the grand prix weekend, so my review is 5 months behind. We got the ladies package where we were given chips to claim drinks. Yes you heard me right. Chips like the ones you get at the gambling tables. The idea seems really archaic. Some of us didn't have purses, so girls with purses held onto all the chips. At the beginning, when my friend was distributing all the chips, some fell. It's a club...so it's dark and there's people everywhere. The funny thing is we dropped them several times throughout the night, and somehow they would magically disappear...we turned on our phone lights and formed a light tower with our phones but they were nowhere to be found. It's as if the moment the chips fell onto the floor, the floor opened up and sucked the chips in. Frustrating and really strange...there's got to be a better way of tracking drinks other than using chips.  But you know what, had they actually served regular and not watered down alcohol, I wouldn't even be bringing up the chip issue because I'd be too tipsy to care. We each had 10 chips. I had over 10 drinks in the span of 2 hours - a combo of shots and mixed drinks and then some that friends bought, but barely felt anything. I'm less than 110 pounds. Normally 5 drinks gives me a good buzz. 10 will get me severely trashed. The group felt the same way. We all had a good amount to drink, but barely felt a buzz. Not cool man. Pulling something shady like this on one of your busiest weekends. It's no wonder barely anymore was dancing because nobody was buzzed. Third grip: female bartenders have sticks up their asses. Don't even look at you unless you're male. Probably just want more tip. Two stars because the place was gorgeous and really nicely decorated in the roaring 20's theme. Loved the burlesque performances they put on. And DJ was off the hook! Spinning everything from top 40s, to old school hip hop, and early 2000 jams. We danced our tail feathers off and sang our hearts out. Didn't care if we were sober and no one else was dancing. I had a blast with my girls but that's because we made the most out of the situation."
/user_details?userid=pYXsfDn7zjAjNEwLuJcj1Q,Edward T.,"Jacksonville, FL",4 star rating,Came here for a bachelor party that I had planned. They were easily able to accommodate 12 guys. The food was great and the burlesque shows during dinner were entertaining. Minus one star because the food took a while to come out and the people who were refilling our water were sketchily using bottled water (not cheap) until we asked them to use only tap water. Would come back again!
/user_details?userid=AmdCFgsNc0cwxhY34lm0zg,Boris D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"Went with a group to Bord'Elle to see a burlesque show.  It was advertised as a pre-fixe menu and a show, but we went there specifically for the advertised burlesque show.  Sat around for two and a half hours eating the food, which was pretty good, and saw about 5 minutes of a performance.  Asked the staff when the show will be, and they all said ""a bit later.""  Around 10:30, the place was converted from a restaurant to a club, at which point we were told we have to order bottle service if we want to stay at the table.  But still no burlesque show.So good job Bord'Elle, you really know how to misrepresent yourself and scam customers out of money.  I think I can summarize it fairly clearly:1. Advertise burlesque show2. Require purchasing of an overpriced pre-fixe menu to see the show3. In the span of the whole time, tease the customers with a 5 minute performance, saying the rest of the show ""will be in a bit""4. Right before the ""actual"" show, now you also have to buy an overpriced bottle to stay at your table.We couldn't bear it any longer.  When they asked to buy a bottle, we left.  Decent food, no burlesque show, dishonest promoting.  Needless to say, not worth it."

Just go to drink and party and look at beautiful people. ;) Every time I come here to party I always have a great time. The music they play is a bit of everything and it gets packed! However I came her for a bachelorette to eat and party and the food was sadly disappointing. I had the poke bowl and it was so bland. At least the rice helped me soak up the alcohol I was about to drink that night which is more than I can say for some. I had some of my cousins tartare trio and it was meh. The beef one had too much mustard in it and the salmon and tuna tartares were nothing special. The cheese platter we got was huge and impressive in size but the cheese itself was not. My cousin said the cheese they gave us was like the type of cheese she gives her kids!! lol

There was an eclectic and well-dressed crowd, several bachelor/bachelorette parties, and while it was crowded, we could still move.

/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Landed here for a Thursday night happy hour after seeing their promos for $1 oysters. Their Thursday night happy hour is far less expensive than their usual fare. Until 8pm, it was $5 pints, $7 cocktails and glasses of wine, as well as $7 tapas plates. We sipped on Hoegaarden, shared shrimp tacos, tartar and a cheese plate. All of these were scrumptious. The oysters themselves were good, only 1 small chip in my 6, however they were served 30 minutes after ordering, and when they arrived they were sitting mostly in water instead of actual ice. This meant that a few of them had lost their flavor which was quite unfortunate, and I was very surprised to see them sent out from the kitchen in such an obvious state. Despite the oyster issue, and the fact that there weren't actual seats at the bar unless you reserved (counter to my earlier phone call to inquire), we had a five star night. We were pleasantly surprised when there was entertainment (hottie on the swing, mini burlesque performance). Our bartender was amazing in her energy and service, Mylene definitely made it a night to remember with our interactions. Even our lovely doorman helped us in and out of the entrance hand in hand despite neither my coworker nor myself dressed to what is likely their usual standard of attire. The staff we interacted with were all great, even the coatcheck guy. Overall, we will definitely be back."

At 10:30 they started dropping hints to leave even though they had never told us they needed the table AND we were in the middle of eating. We had ordered tons of drinks but they wanted us to make way for the bottle service which used to start at 12 AM at most places. 3) the music was terrible: dance re-mixes of tunes that should be left alone.4) super cheesy vibe If you're looking for a hip, cool vibe in Montreal this is NOT the place to go."

/user_details?userid=8M_eqHwJPg5ha_ygO40oPw,Timothy F.,"Providence, RI",1 star rating,"[note: there are a bunch of non-recommended 1 star reviews. I recommend you read and believe them, and seriously question the 5 stars. It seems a lot of other folks were just as disgusted as us and created yelp accounts just to put this place on blast, not realizing yelp would stick them in the corner]So, my girlfriend and I attended the New Year's Gatsby event at Bord'Elle. It was billed as 25+ with a jazz quartet and burlesque as well as circus-style performances.We walked in at 10:30 and ordered 2 overpriced drinks for $24 at the large bar downstairs. The bar uses an electronically metered pour, so my cognac looked very sad indeed. It appeared to possibly be 1 oz. The space is beautiful, but the music was pulsating techno, not the jazz we were promised.Looking for an escape from the overcrowded space (it is much smaller than it appears in photos and does not have a dance floor.) We made our way to the upstairs bar and learned from our(awesome) bartender that the jazz was only for dinner service at 6pm(???!) and we would be subjected to the whim of the two terrible DJs all night.The bathrooms were disgusting, gold toilets did not class it up, and the coke use was not at all discrete. At some point they shut down the upstairs bathrooms. Reading the other reviews I am going to assume this is due to the feces smeared on the wall. My girlfriend had to beg a bouncer to be allowed to rejoin me upstairs after using the ladies room downstairs(which had no toilet paper- a fact she brought to the attention of multiple people, non of whom's job this was apparently.) It was nice to know that our spot had suddenly become so exclusive and VIP, but seriously guy, you just watched her come down the stairs.We finally ventured downstairs just prior to midnight, when the music became slightly more tolerable and danceable, but the ADD DJs could not leave a track on for more than 20 seconds. As soon as the crowd's mood turned to dancing they would change the song. In hindsight, maybe it was for the best, since there was no room to dance.Also, the billed ""burlesque dancing"" happened once in the 3.5 hours we were there, unless you count the girl on the swing, who was on the swing 2 times- and I am assuming that was the circus-like entertainment.The worst part is this: TIckets cost $65 in advance. I could have paid the same to go to an open bar with coked out bros and barely legal girls at a bunch of other clubs. We chose this one because it sounded like a relaxing, fun and stylish way to ring in the New Year. We were sadly mistaken. Also, no champagne toast. You could not get champagne at the bar we were at upstairs, nor at the main bar. To obtain a glass you could only go to the other upstairs bar(for real? it's New Year's eve) and pay $15 for a flute of Prosecco. It seems enough people found the vibe as lame as we did, since they decided they could offer $25 admission after midnight.Scariest part of the evening: We carefully stood near a ""sortie"" (EXIT) at all times, due to the fact that all bottle-service(and there was a lot of it) was escorted by giant sparklers, including a menorah of sparklers going out with a magnum of Monet. Coming from a state where a club-fire caused by fireworks killed 100 people, I was very wary of how close these sparklers came to igniting the balloons and the low-ceiling upstairs. I can't believe this is actually a thing.Highlight of the night: the bartender upstairs, who seemed like a genuinely good guy.After reading all the other reviews I am so glad that we opted not to go for dinner service. Our last minute walk-in at Nouveau Palais was the best decision we made that night. Anyway, I recommend never going to this place. Ever. It is pretty, but there are much better spots.Oh, and just as an aside. If you own a $3k clutch(or even if you don't) and order $100 worth of drinks, a $2 tip is not appropriate. People are so cheap it hurts."

We went around 5:30pm on a Friday. The place was fully reserved, but we luckily were able to get an open spot at the bar to sit and eat. My wife and I shared all the orders. We started with the cheese and meats plate. It was massive and a great price for what we got with a good selection of meat, cheese, and fruit. We then had a tomahawk steak with creamed sweet potato, roasted cauliflower, and roasted broccolini. Then we finished with the apple pie cheese cake. WOW. All of the food was so delicious and definitely enough for both my wife and I. Then to top it all off, the staff was great.

Our group of 4 each ordered an appetizer that we shared - shrimp cocktail, the amazing cheese platter, the Deconstructed Caesar salad (loved the little cheese grater) and the Asian salad. We all loved the use of rainbow beets in the salad. The size of the appetizers was perfect for sharing and getting a taste of everything. The entrees we chose were the Chicken Bento Supreme (amazingly tender and tasty, tad spicy chicken), Salmon Poke Bowl, and Beef Tatako. Again, perfect portion sizes for sharing and all was so delicious. Lastly desert, not able to choose, we want with all three - the Chai Infused Creme  Brûlée, Brownie Cheesecake and the Half Baked cookie. Needless to say, all was amazing! We had the sweetest and most attentive waitress, she was informative and kind. The decor is so beautiful! Parts remind me of being at my grandparents home when I was a kid, while others are fancy and elegant. All in all it's a place I would want to spend more time at.

We were all way too sober and alert to make light of the awkward setting.I will say that the decor of this venue is really beautiful. Super modern and well coordinated. It's worth mentioning that going to the lady's bathroom is a horrifying experience of walking down narrow winding stairs with no banister (or so I recalled as such), whereby each step was like a foot tall. It's an accident waiting to happen.Food was actually pretty good. It's really unfortunate that the chef probably knows what he's (or she's) doing, but I don't see this place surviving."

/user_details?userid=e47LfbsAVBCn_9R7ovV7wA,Alex V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Food was mediocre quality and very overpriced for what it is. Drinks were watered down but good. Fun atmosphere and vibe but not worth it for dinner. Can do much better

If so I think this is your jam! Bottle service all around, guy at the bar next to us drinking $2000 bottle of Dom Perignon (not sharing with his driver or four body guards), girl swinging from the ceiling, good music.... We Were Entertained! Next time I will come for the supper as well as the booze!"

/user_details?userid=Dxd6FZKyMQJvpBErJLn8nw,Kevin D.,"London, United Kingdom",1 star rating,"I recommend avoiding it! I was there over the weekend for the first and last time and experienced a lot of what other reviewers have mentioned... rude staff, long waits, poorly cooked food. The bathroom was gross when I went in it as well. The staff were clearly overwhelmed in every regard. These experiences seem to be a trend."

/user_details?userid=6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a new hot spot super club. I came with a group of girls for dinner. We had to make the reservation about a month in advance for a sat night. And it's a hard place to get into unless you eat here first. The average age is 30s and 40s. They left a bottle of water on the table but were not so attentive to refilling it. Since I'm pregnant, there was only 1 not raw dish on the menu that I could eat. It was the chicken. Luckily it was really good. It's wasn't small but not very filling either.My friend got the tuna poke. It looked good and I would probably try it in the future. Although she said there was too much rice. My meal only came up to $25 including tip. Mind you I didn't get any appetizers or drinks. They took our table away at 10:30pm and it turned into a club. The DJ, Puppa Sacha, played such great music! It made my night! There was also a dancer on a swing that added to the entertainment. Good place! I will come back for the decent food and great music!"

We also asked for bottle service but you need to buy 2 bottles and not just 1 bottle, which is fine if you have a bigger group of people with you."

/user_details?userid=Bx-21cuFUfs3uWB2EEPw3w,Jessica M.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"First, the good stuff (because the list is short): The decor is cool. I liked the chandeliers. Now, the bad stuff (a much longer list): The food is disgusting, undercooked, and takes hours to arrive (literally, hours). The drinks are weak and overpriced. After my second watered-down drink, I started ordering shots, assuming that they couldn't possibly water-down a shot. The bathrooms...oh lord. The. Grossest. Piss and poop on the floors of the stalls (the people who go here must be animals). I was so horrified I lost my appetite afterwards, which was actually a blessing, because the food was that bad. If my chicken takes hours to arrive, there is zero excuse for it to be undercooked. I highly recommend staying away from this place."
/user_details?userid=_EAHKYcVf05B5AYstQRz4A,Debbie R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place and planning my next visit with my significant other. Each time I go, it's different! My last experience was a 5 a 7 in the Champagne lounge. We tried two different champagne cocktails, delicious! The wait staff and hosts are super welcoming and attentive but give you space to spend time with the person(s) you are with. What I really love about it is that is feels warm, welcoming yet terrifically class and different! Check out the various spaces on different levels, vintage photos and decor and definitely sample some of the list of cocktails whichever space you spend time in. A friend told me that the food is delicious and I intend to check that out next! Way to go Bord'Elle team!"
