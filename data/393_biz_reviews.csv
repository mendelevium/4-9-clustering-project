Came here on a Monday afternoon around 2 pm. It's exam season, so the café was packed. The first thing I noticed when I entered was how beautiful the café is. The murals and plants add so much to the space, making it a serene and enjoyable space to work or relax. Although their menu states that filtered coffee is only available before 1pm, I asked them if they could make one for me and they did. That's what I call great service. The coffee was made with Pilot coffee, which is a wonderful roaster from Toronto. Good stuff.There are hooks for jackets under the tables, and outlets are easily accessible. Free wifi is included as well. This is a fantastic café; nice ambiance, great staff and most importantly, good coffee. 100% would recommend!"

/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I love all the natural light that floods into this place. It makes it perfect for studying or an afternoon read. The décor is minimal with a black and white colour scheme accented with wood and greenery. The latte is rich and the staff are really friendly. I believe this café opened not too long ago so I'll probably come here more often before it becomes flooded with regulars!P.S. They just surprised me with some free samples...sweet!
/user_details?userid=pVNGGWaroaQ0MDHtBnmaHQ,Abir F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Super friendly staff and great coffee. It is rare to find a chatty barista in the plateau who takes the time to ask you about your Saturday plans. The coffee was a bit acidic for my taste but great nonetheless. Would like to try their grilled cheese next time but definitely worth the try!
/user_details?userid=5o05OPIAhp5oAs7E6a9JNQ,Crystal Y.,"Kaohsiung, Taiwan",5 star rating,The staff was friendly to introduce the real breakfast samples to us at first. It's really helpful to have a choice quickly. Every time I pass by I think the mural and plant decorating are so beautiful. It's really enjoyable to come here and have a weekend breakfast in the morning. The quality coffee is great as well as sandwiches. Love the ambience.

/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been to this coffee shop twice and they offer good drinks and the vibes of this bright cafe are simply amazing. Lately they offered a new drink: caramel latte, which was not sooo sweet and tastes quite good! I like the quality of the coffee here, as well as the friendly staff. They always want to get feedback from customers and do better. The interior decor of the café is simplistic but super nice, with quite a few plants and beautiful flowers in spring. The café is trendy and bright, ideal to study, work and chill with friends, definitely recommending!"

Accessible location, perfect lighting for studying, lots of plugs, delicious Pilot coffee, and best of all, AMAZING staff. Seriously I've been here for 3 hours and gotten a free matcha latte and a sample of sausage pizza. Granted, don't come expecting free stuff everyday, but do expect to be welcomed with friendly smiles :)"
