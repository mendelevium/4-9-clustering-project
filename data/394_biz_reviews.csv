/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for an early supper around 4pm and the place was empty. This restaurant is very small as it only features 3 tables and bar stool seating. Best to come at irregular hours or get take out since it could get quite cramped.My boyfriend and I are big BBQ fanatics and we love all-american style eats. Blackstrap BBQ met our expectations in terms of menu and flavor, however pricing and portion were disappointing.We both got brisket sandwiches with sides of the fried mac and cheese cubes ($15 each), a pork sausage ($4) and burnt ends poutine ($9) however didn't leave full. If you really want a feast and sampling of the menu, come as a group to share the trios/meat platters. Either way, seems like you need to spend upwards of $25-30$ a person to eat well.The brisket was so tender, it tasted and melted in your mouth just like butter. The fried mac and cheese was suprisingly creamy - I've tried something similar and it was your cheap boxed mac and cheese but Blackstrap clearly uses a homemade blend of cheeses and thick sauce.The burnt ends poutine was rich and salty, however the fries weren't as fresh as they could be. The sausage was delicious but not worth $4 a pop.There's still lots on the menu I want to try so I would come back but can't make this a regular thing- it's just too expensive for how much I like to eat."

We wanted to sample a little of everything so we got a brisket slider, fried Mac and cheese, and of course the burn ends poutine. The gravy was flavorful and the cheese was gooey and perfect. The bbq they make was different than most I have had but in the top 5 of my favorite I've had. Staff was very nice and helpful."
/user_details?userid=3pu410Sc-05F4uFh417XqQ,Jackie H.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Came here for the poutine with burnt ends, and didn't realize exactly what I was in for.  First I got a draft beer for $5 which was super refreshing on this hot day. There is seating inside and two picnic tables outdoors- we opted for the outside. Out comes a metal bin, sort of looks like a small sink, filled with hot French fries, cheese curds, gravy, and burnt ends with a ton of meat. Really delicious, containing all of the artery busting glory you would imagine given those ingredients. I would recommend maybe not going for a large as we did, but it was an enjoyable adventure following the gravy to the bottom of the sink. Looking forward to returning to try the BBQ!"
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Had a black strap bar b q delivery on a  stay in first date recently and was a little bit hectic since I'm not a huge fan of bar-b-q since I have a really weird fear of bones ( I'm working on it ). Needless to say I was happily surprised my date suggest I get a brisket since there were no bones and swore it was amazing. She was absolutely right ! The brisket was delicious and juicy. I went for the sweet barbq sauce and a side of green beans since I was trying to be a little healthy. The beans were actually really good and even tho I did miss that cornbread it was a really great side. The sauce wasn't spicy which made eating everything really enjoyable for me. I have to admit that it was a little acidic and I did need a tums after the fact but that was my only complaint.Would love to go and have a sit down meal here and taste a lot of other things on the menu

The Ribs were very dry and hard. As for the brisket, it was nice but was served barely warm.The cheese in the fried mac and cheese has absolutely 0 flavour...Their house spicy sauce was way too watery and it had too much vinegar in it and nothing spicy about it.Definitely not award-worthy BBQ."

But was tasty.i had two meat plate Ribs& chicken and smoked pork poutine. It came to over $30. Felt perhaps they could give half rack and chicken for that price but like I said tasty. Most restaurants are expensive these days so at least food was good.

And the decoration is so so, it's not a place to go with a first date for sure, or maybe if you don't want more date go there ha ha !One of the best BBQ restaurant in Montreal : Blackstrap BBQ !Parfois c'est bien d'aller plus loins que le centre-ville cela permets de trouver de petites perles !Situé à Verdun (station de l'église) ce restaurant possède tous ce que vous voulez comme viandes cuites au BBQ.J'ai mangé une poitrine de poulet et c'était délicieux, tous le monde avec moi on bien aimés leurs repas and m'ont dis que leurs ribs étaient très bonnes !Avec un service de restaurant ( Commander, attender à votre table et manger !), donc pas la place pour amener une première date, peut-être si vous ne voulez pas de 2ème date ha ha !Une décoration très simple avec des bancs en bois.Un des meilleur BBQ à Montréal : Blackstrap BBQ !"

/user_details?userid=5B5VU6-wA0ooGYJp1nNNEA,Richard B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"For a place that showcase their trophies from the front window, I'm a bit underwhelmed. I've heard many good things about Blackstrap but I left dissapointed. Perhaps I was expecting too much? The service wasn't anything out of the ordinary - simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, the same goes for the food. The meats lean towards the dry side which is the opposite of what I want in BBQ. I wanted to try the ribs but they weren't available while I was there. The evening hasn't arrived yet but they're already out of ribs? The sides of fried mac n cheese was something I was looking forward to but what I got were deep fried balls of bland macaroni. Not really my ideal side dish. Sorry to say this but I'm not really impressed with the quality of the food. It's not bad but I've had better. Maybe I shouldn't expect too much from a place next time."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ribs are probably my favorite food (right after sushi) and this place doesn't let down. We got ""Le Gros"" for 40$ this is such a good deal. We got to try about of everything, ribs, chicken, pork and brisket. As well as coleslaw, 2 extra sides and 2 little buns. For the sides we got sweet potatoes and fried mac and cheese balls. The sweet potatoes to my disappointment, were just entire chunks of potato... I though they were going to be fries. But the fried mac and cheese balls O.M.G! Literally balls of deep fried m&c! AMAZING those were the best thing in the tray. A MUST GETAs for the meat the ribs were fall of the bone amazing. The pork was juicy and tender, much better than I expected. The brisket was ok abit dry and too peppery for my taste. The chicken was good but apart from the crispy skin its still just chicken.The place is a mix between fast food and restaurant. You order at the counter upfront and pay right away. Give your name and they will call you when its ready. Which I like. Unfortunately not many places to sit inside. Mostly counter space and 2 picnic tables. But I get it adds to the rustic charm."

I got the burnt ends poutine and my mom got a basic BBQ sandwich with slaw.Overall pretty good, the poutine was pretty delish!  My mom gobbled up the BBQ sandwich in no time. Had to ask for ice for my drink, andy mom got water which they did not bring her, so she had to ask. Overall good experience."

/user_details?userid=7b_KYbyhEa40hNz1qdIa6Q,Fred K.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Everything this place serves is absolutely amazing. If you like pulled pork/other meats but don't like them clobbered with sauce this place is great because you get to put your own sauce on. The communal seating can be a little challenging because you can't make reservations if you want to go with a lot of people, but it can fun too if you like the social aspect of communal seating. For the price I'd tend to expect larger portions which is the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars. It's always enough to fill me up, but for the money (I will continue to spend whenever I go there) it'd be nice to have some leftovers for a midnight snack. Quality over quantity here! An award winning must try!"

I've ordered it and it was tender, other times it was ridiculously dry. They do not cook their meat with bbq sauce.Expensive for what you end up getting.Fries are perfect, poutine is delicious."

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Been here 4-5 times and the ribs are always dry and undercooked. The meat stuck so much to the bones I had to tear it off with quite a lot of perpendicular force.The half chicken portion is generous and has the best value for the price. It's smokey and quite tender. But the chicken skin is too dry. It's not 'bite through'.The brisket has a nice smoke ring and is tender. The burnt ends were a bit chewy though.The pulled pork is nice with the sweet sauce, but I prefer a fruity sauce over a molasses-brown-sugar sauce.The fried mac n cheese is my favorite side, mainly because it's fried to perfection and didn't taste too much like imitation cheese.The average quality of the BBQ is probably worth 3.5/5, considering every item on the menu, mostly due to the dry-as-f*ck ribs.I want to see the BBQ scene grow in Montreal so I'll support this with a 4/5."
/user_details?userid=wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,Bill T.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Almost...so close...just about.Blackstrap was thisclose to getting five stars from me, all but for an extra pinch of salt.On the recommendation of several Montreal Yelpers (wise, hip and above average in looks, the whole lot of them), I journeyed to the somewhat depressing area of Verdun to seek out this ""burnt ends"" poutine I'd heard about.  Walking from the subway, the neighborhood seemed a little shabby and down at the heels but the folks on the street seemed to be full of life so I figured I was in for a treat.And boy was I!  Walking into Blackstrap, the smell of BBQ meat is strong.  My mouth watered as I waited to place my order.  After ordering, I sat on a stool and watched the masters behind the counter prepare the orders.   As I was watching the guy prepare what turned out to be my order, I saw him add some salt and then toss the frites.  He then almost started to put the rest of the stuff on, but decided to add another pinch of salt.  I thought nothing of it and when he called my name, the glistening tray of fries, curds, gravy and burnt ends looked divine.  It was a nice night so I sat at a table on the sidewalk and enjoyed the envious glances of passerby as they looked longingly at my poutine.In short, it was delicious.  I mean- oh my gosh, this is so good- delicious.  About half way through eating it, the salt really started to add up.  Now, I'm pro-salt but it started to overpower the gravy and I can't help but think if he hadn't thrown that extra toss of salt in, this would have been perfection in a steel dish.But that's a minor nitpick on my part.  The poutine was amazing and it was my second favorite I had during my Montreal poutine crawl."

But it's not at the top of my list."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty satisfied with my Uber Eats order from this place. Ordered two items: (1) the brisket meal and (2) the pulled pork sandwich with fried macaroni and cheese balls. My daughter enjoyed (2) - she especially liked the fried macaroni and cheese balls. One quibble: the sandwich didn't come with the specified ""fixings"" from the order. I also like my order. Intially, I thought the quantity of food was skimpy in (1): a mini bun instead of a normal size bun and a pretty small portion of chili. But the amount turns out perfect - everything in the meal was quite filing so larger portions would have been excessive. The brisket was the best BBQ brisket I've tried in Montreal (not to be confused with Montreal style smoked meat brisket - which I prefer) and the chili - though a bit too mild - was excellent (all meat, no beans). Overall, no serious complaints. Will re-order in the future."
/user_details?userid=CwUvSaeItqpFCDh0jHaNuQ,Lily Y.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Food: The food is amazing, the meat is tender and flavourful, but on the heavy side. Thank god for the coleslaw and greens. Of course if you have a heavier taste the home sauce on the table will make you satisfied for sure~ Probably one of the best BBQ place in Mtl~Service: Semi-selfserve, especially when it's busy. You pay at the counter, the food is brought to you then you are left on your own, which is ok for me to pour my own water etc.Value: You may find it expensive but it's enough to make you full for 2 meals~Ambiance: A tiny shop on Verdun with open kitchen concept. Inside there are long wooden tables with bench, makes you feel homey-comfy."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Only one word: yeeeeehaaaw! Finally real southern BBQ cooked slow and low in Montreal. Word traveller, humble pit master, Blackstrap owner Dylan Kier is a young alchemist constantly looking for ways to perfect his culinary craft. The result is simply divine! Extremely friendly, the staff makes ordering lunch or dinner such a pleasure.Last week, I ordered the pulled pork platter (very juicy) with a side baked beans (not too overdone like other places) and tangy cole slaw. Had to come back a week later for the dry rub smoked half-rack of ribs since they ran out. The trip back was worthwhile... also added an extra side of tasty beef brisket and hand cut fries. Don't forget to try both the sweet bbq sauce as well as the hot sauce (not that hot btw).Will certainly return to try the ""burnt ends"" Poutine since it contains a good mix of lean and less lean brisket odds ends. For those working downtown, it's less than 15 minutes away by car - worth the detour!"
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"yeehawwww! Can I say that? Because I really get this Western/cowboy feel/atmosphere in this place. There is a wagon wheel and bull hooks etc and the decor is really cool. Now the food is really tasty but heavy I must say. I ordered the pork plate which is just pork meat, a side of coleslaw, a little cute small circular piece of bread, and fries. On the table was some house sauce (spicy and sweet) I loveedddd the pork and I loveeed the fries. It's not too cheap but it's not that expensive either. For my plate it was around 16 bucks, but you get really full. trust me! The restaurant is open kitchen concept which I think is great because my friend and I were intently watching the cooks make our food. We saw what looked like fried breaded cubes of something and it looked absolutely amazing! What really caught our eye was the brisket (chest) poutine. It's like super poutine. When I mean super it is poutine on another level...upgraded. I have to try that next time. I really enjoyed my experience here. Totally casual restaurant and great place to take friends (or a date!! why not!)Really really really recommend this spot if you are on Wellington street in Verdun."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I just need to reiterate, having been this week, that this is possibly the best BBQ in the city. It's a close compete with Triple Crown but it's so different and far away  there's no need to fight. The burnt ends poutine is one of my all time favourite things, and the fact that I'm currently eating the leftovers for breakfast should confirm that diagnosis. They also have Creemore springs on tap, and a few local bottled beers. The ribs and chicken wings and hot sauce are all exceptional, dry and vinagery and moist like crazy and the room is chill, not trying to be anything but still good looking and there are a few picnic tables outside to enjoy the thrum of life happening on Wellington."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Blackstrap BBQ is a wonderful establishment. The best thing about it is its unpretentiousness, nothing fancy, just some really good barbecued food. The second best thing are their ribs, so yummy.  What I also like is the coleslaw, the deep fried mac n cheese, the french fries are perfect. The brisket was good, but needed some addition of BBQ sauce to bring out flavours. But the best is yet to come, quality fries and the brisket are important ingredients to make good poutine and their burnt ends poutine is excellent.  Love their small patio during the summer, just two picnic tables you may need to share with other customers, the always smiling staff from behind the cashier will bring your food, while you sip your beer. Their drink options are well picked and include Bierbrier's bottled brew. The Joe Beef Special Pils is available and is actually perfect choice for meaty meal.  Solid five stars on my special six star scale."

Although a little small with very limited seating, and the fact that it was packed, service was fast, and the food was good. We ordered the brisket with a side of fried mac and cheese as well as the ribs with fries. Both were good but the brisket was waaaaaaay better! Falling apart, super juicy, and absolutely delicious would be my description.. The ribs were also good but not better than those found at Bar-B-Barn.. Fries were delicious. Mac and cheese was super disappointing. Didn't really taste like anything. Neither one of us liked the accompanying coleslaw and left it pretty much untouched. Bread wasn't good either.All in all a 3.5 rating, but since I can't allocate half stars (hint hint Yelp management :p), I'll round up because the staff was friendly and ambience was great. If you're in the mood for some BBQ, make your way here!"
/user_details?userid=Bdt3OCqC2GATCOjj0ryz1A,Jon T.,"Cream Ridge, NJ",4 star rating,A nice find after a long sunny day at the Canadian Grand Prix.  Low keyed place with some roadside seating for alfresco chowing down. We shared a mixed platter for 2 included were ribs (excellent) sausages (good - not spicy enuf for my taste) and brisket (great). Had a side of haricots vertes which were nicely cooked and voluminous. Good choice of beers and price wasn't too painful - especially since my buddy bought. All in all a nice culinary surprise in Montréal
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The service wasn't as quick as I would have expected, and I could have used a little more meat on my poutine for the $13.80 price tag. Their beer was overpriced and they fact that thy use 14 oz cups mean that you're actually only getting 12 oz of beer since they had a heavy helping of foam. Don't get me wrong, the poutine itself tasted pretty good, and the sweet sauce really helped it reach a certain level of tasty, but I lose my appetite a bit after I pull the second hair out of my food. The first hair, I can deal with. Accidents happen and we lose hair off our heads all the time, but two in a single half of my take out congainer? Not cool."
/user_details?userid=fgqnj3HEGqjRwgW1jZ1htg,Jack B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Blackstrap BBQ was pretty disappointing. I ordered the combo of ribs, brisket, and sausage with a side of macaroni. The ribs were dry and tougher to chew than beef jerky (no exaggeration, I had to pull with force to bite it off). The macaroni was bland and, like the ribs, also dry. The bbq sauces were overpowered by vinegar. The Brisket was great though. However, for 20$ I was given the saddest piece of three ribs I've ever seen and a tiny portion of brisket. When you can go to a place downtown like Le Smoking BBQ and get a generous portion of better tasting BBQ for the same price, Blackstrap is just not worth the money... even if you live close to Verdun.Oh yeah, there was a sausage too."
/user_details?userid=STGdWAW7jxJp3I7zvnQouQ,Stan M.,"Kahnawake, Canada",3 star rating,Bar B Q is very good so the food is 4 stars but the fact you can't get a seat to eat it brings it down to 3 starsIn the summer you can maybe sit outside but having to drive to it and then wait until you drive home to eat the food takes away from the work invested in the meals. I ate there once and it was very good. But don't go back because there is nowhere to sit if it's a bit busy.

Personally, I don't know that it should have made the list. The food for the most part was OK, their brisket was slightly dry, fries were good, pulled pork was alright, chicken, I have to say was juicy, and the fried mac'n'cheese was pretty damn delicious. Wasn't a fan of the coleslaw or the greens. Small place, giving a quaint feel, staff was great. Price point wasn't bad. Hated that they give plastic cutlery.

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"After constantly hearing about Blackstrap BBQ this place has been a Yelp bookmark of mine for months now. Sadly it's located in Verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town... as luck would have it a small community Yelp event brought close to a dozen Yelpers to this place during happy hour. I just couldn't say no to this.The first thing I noticed is that it's pretty much a hole in a wall, you can easily walk RIGHT by without even noticing it. Parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots... which haven't been modernized in any shape or form. It's 2014 folks, I've been paying my parking spots all over Montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... why is this place still accepting coins? Ridiculous!I ordered their reputed burnt ends poutine and some root beer. The service was about an average wait but they were kind enough to bring me my food while I was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow Yelpers while I nursed my root beer. :)Sadly, I wasn't a fan of their poutine. While the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely heavy... I couldn't finish it for multiple reasons. Kindly note, that I feel I might be the oddball here but I felt the fries weren't up to par to what I've had for places hyped such as this place. The cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce... which should hold everything together... was weak. The brisket meat was good though. They do offer you some BBQ sauce bottles to spice up their poutine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but I honestly feel if you NEED to do this, your poutine isn't really what it should be. Fries, cheese curds, gravy. Maybe some extra condiments to your liking... that's what it should be. Sweet or spicy sauce shouldn't be added. But that's just me. However, the sweet sauce made the mediocre poutine actually more edible. So Hooray?The price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine. I know there's a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poutine, I still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be. I'm sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but I haven't had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the poutine and thus, it's pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in Montreal and while other Yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket, I guess this place simply isn't for me."

The food was fantastic, the staff were incredibly cheery and nice.Then it seemed out of nowhere the quality of their food declined in a big way. It was dry and flavorless. But I kept on going back in hopes of it being just bad luck.The final straw was when I visited in the evening and the place was empty, I was ordering to go for a friend and I. I placed an order for 1x Brisket sandwich, 1x Pulled pork sandwich, 2x fries. When I got home and opened the bag I got a (very dry) brisket sandwich, collard greens and a poutine for $48.When I called the restaurant and explained the situation the answer I got was a chuckle and a ""I can't do anything now, but can you call back tomorrow?""I'm sad because I really liked your food and service."

Since then, I'm not sure what's happened but the quality seems to have gone down with meats being dry and tough. We ordered delivery (something new for Blackstrap?) yesterday and it was a straight up disaster. If you offer delivery, and especially if you charge extra for it (+$3.00), please do it well. We ordered two plates, both of which are supposed to come with a side. They forgot one plate entirely, delivered us one plate with the wrong side, and added the two sides that we originally ordered as ""extras"" (so we were charged the full amount for the two sides that were supposed to be included with our plates). We called to try to rectify the issue. The person on the phone could not understand, for the life of her, what had gone wrong with the order, and that the two sides we had ordered were supposed to be included with the plates. 30 minutes later, they sent us the missing plate (no sides, no sauce) and charged the full amount for it. Sorry, Blackstrap - but it's the last time."

I was quite disapointed that the pork had no sauce/flavor... It was serve with two sauces on the side... Which means I had to open my sandwich and put sauce on the burger myself! I thought this was not the high Blackstrap BBQ standard I was told about... All in all I'm in no hurry to go back! I hope for their sake that the ribs have sauce :O
/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montrealers are used to sloppy saucy BBQ, think of Scores, Baton Rouge, Bar-B-Barns and the undisputed king of Montreal BBQ, Le Boucan. Everything is steeped in sauce and something gets lost.But there are many states in the US that are known for smoked BBQ and they all have their approaches. Sauce, dry, tangy, vinegary, sweet, cidery. Blackstrap BBQ goes dry... don't stop reading please.The beauty of dry is that the flavour never gets buried under sauce. You get to experience the flavour in their rub, taste the porc or beef. DRY IS GOOD.Plus they gots sauce, a spicy one and a sweet one, where you can control your saucing.They have the classics. Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Collard Greens, Slaw, Beans and some other more modern BBQ goodies. I can't properly identify what's in their rub yet but it is tasty beyond measure. The bark is creates on the meat, whether it's the ribs, the pulled pork or the brisket is like pure candy. The ribs are meaty, tasty and NOT fall off the bone. Yes, yes I know, but having more chew to it is better. The taste is pure pork goodness. Combined with the rub bark... makes you want to believe in gods. Same for the beef brisket, which has a thick layer of fat that after the smoking progress simply melts in your mouth along with the crumbling meat, without overwhelming you with fatty taste and it is seriously one of the best brisket I've had.The pulled pork disappointed me a little - perhaps it's the batch - and seemed to be lacking the fat that makes pulled pork so freakishly delicious. The whole point of using the Boston butt is because of the flavour and the fat. The pulled pork I had was on the dry side, not sauce-less-dry, but dry of fat. Hopefully it was just the batch.The beans, also a disappointment, but I'll blame my finickiness about beans on that. The smoke was overwhelming and the beans rather firm, the dreaded bean-bullets. I prefer slow cooked to perfection beans and by slow cooked I mean about 8 hours of cooking. Their fries are really good, surprisingly since American style French-fries are usually dry, crispy bits of tasteless potato disaster. But they have found a tasty middle ground here. The cole slaw is unpalatable, much to much vinegar or cider in the dressing and despite my adoration of cole slaw I can easily overlook that because of the following...DEEPFRIEDMACN'CHEESESeriously, I could rave about their smoked meats, but the deep fried Mac n' Cheese is insanely delicious. I expected some Mac n' Cheese because, it's the southern side of choice. But to have little balls of Mac n' Cheese battered and fried, is pure heaven. Pinch of salt, melted cheese in the middle... crazy stuff, crazy stuff.The decor, the good service, the proximity to my home, all make for BBQ goodness and joy. Only 2 tables, the rest if the seating are stools to a bar. The open kitchen allows you to grok at the food being prepared and talk with the cooks/owners. They have take-out also. I suspect that once the work out the kinks, things will only get better. I sincerely hope the restaurant is popular with Verdunites because I want it to stay open for a long time which at the same time is a bad thing... I'm gonna eat there to often."

Take note ~ you have GOT to try this place (and then probably come in every other week!) - big fan already, of this unique place in VerdunAtmosphere:  The Blackstrap place that specializes smoked barbecue (very slow cooked) meats.  Dilan, the owner / chef, spent the summer of 2012 competing in BBQ competitions (these sort of things exist?) all over the U.S., even wining acclaim for his Brisket receipt.  The seating is basic and the place is set up with a distinct rustic feel to it.Service:  Partly help-yourself (i.e. you must pick up your food at a counter) partly waiter service (you can ask the staff if you have requests).  I found the people there downright loveable, and very very accommodating and approachable.  You'll love coming here for the crowd too ~ youngish and usually in groups, the place fills up quite a bit at dinner time.Food:  Top (top) marks.  Unlike the run of the  mill BBQ places around the city (think Baton Rouge, St. Hubert, & Scores) Blackstrap smoke BBQs their meat slowly, giving the meats (Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Turkey) a dry (non-greasy) hickory flavour.  Absolutely the best BBQ, to be had.  Made as a plate or in a sandwich, the menu items are too the point, and made to satisfy (I'm a big fan of uncomplicated menus).  Blackstrap makes their own BBQ sauces (sweet or spicy) for those who like a little moisture on their meal, and offers a set of side dishes (fries, bbq beans, deep-fried mac'n cheese balls, coleslaw salad). Prices for all this deliciousness (and generous amounts) is beyond reasonable, it's a downright bargain.A must visit place ~ thank me later!"

Chicken just as well despite a tiny bit of dryness.

Their food is served in these tin trays which adds to the rustic feel of a ribs and BBQ place. They also have locally brewed beers on their menu because who eats ribs and meats with soda?  The prices are a bit higher, especially if you want to get a bit of everything.  It definitely doesn't fall into the cheap eats category. If you live nearby, it's probably better to bring it home and enjoy it that way because there really isn't much in terms of sitting room."

If I didn't know I had to stop at 4436 Rue Wellington to meet my Yelp gangstas, I would have walked straight passed it supposing it is an extension of the neighboring shop.I tried the famous ""Burnt Ends"" poutine and found it a bit disappointing when looking at the price of such a small portion. On the plus side, the sauces furnished tasted fantastic. 14$ for a portion that I can hold in both of my hands is not worth it. My amazing super duper Yelp BFF Sarah also found 2 hairs in her poutine. I, on the other side, am too much of a fatty happy kid to have noticed the possible hairs in mine. I didn't see any nets worn by the staff. The beer was incredibly expensive for the piss customers pay for. (I'm not hating on their beer, but to me, all beers tastes like piss. Some types of urine are more drinkable than others.) Also there was a heavy layer of foam on top and they were served in a cheap little plastic cup. You'd think you'd be entitled to at least a small glass after paying 7$ for a 12oz of beer of budweiser. Might as well just serve Heineken cans for 5$ each. The meal wasn't bad but not worth the money. The service was a bit slow but after a quick look at the restaurant, I noticed business was initially slow when we came in and therefore nothing was cooking when we arrived. I'll give the benefit of the doubt for this time. The service consisting in calling someone's name out is inefficient. Just code the cash register to print out an order number which will be called out by the chef. Since I'm an immigrant, it took the chef a grand number of 4 (or 5?) calls before I finally understood that I was the ""Mi-hey"" they were crying for.The tables were nice, it was decently spacious for such a little restaurant.

I think it was because I asked nicely. That said, I do feel they should change this in their ordering system as it may be a popular choice. Anyways, it's ultimate poutine heaven. It's possibly the best poutine I've had. The ribs are meaty and juicy. They're ribs! I wish there was a side sauce but there isn't. I loved the fried mac n cheese too - I could eat oodles of that. My friend said the chicken was really good but it wasn't ""amazing."" But good.I'd probably get the chili next time. It was mega good and meaty.

When we first walked in we were quickly greeted by our waitress and instructed to make our way to the cash to order. She was friendly and helpful with questions regarding some of the choices on the menu. We quickly decided what to order and oddly were asked to pay right then and there. Since I was paying with my credit card I had no choice to tip in advance. Well, not surprisingly the service greatly suffered from that point on. The food was ready quickly and brought over to our table right away by our waitress, and that was the last we saw of her. Never did she ask if we wanted ketchup, she never asked how our food was and we even ended up pouring own glasses of water from a jug next to the cash.

We're talking Wednesday night at 5:00pm. KINDA odd. I understand that everything is fresh and that it's possible to run out of certain items once in a while...but we're talking mid-week, pre-peak time. They even mention on their website that they may run out of food...as if it was a good thing?!Again, I understand that everything is fresh and cooked for a long time, that they do not want to cook too much food and waste it but we're talking about a restaurant that is just opening and has to build its reputation. Mind you...seeing the amount of 5 stars on here...it seems like they already did. Anyhoot, this left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth (and I wasn't even the one to order brisket!)Speaking of sour...their slaw could definitely use a little LESS vinegar in it. Was not to my taste at all...As a main, I ordered the turkey sandwich with braised green. Aside from the fact that it was cold (we're a 5 minutes car ride away from the resto and it was 15 outside...), the sandwich was ok. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. As far as the greens go, they were also cold and watery. Not what you'd expect from a side of braised greens.Moved on to the ribs...didn't really understand what the fuss was all about. Same for the pulled-pork. The sweet taste that I like so much about pulled-pork was missing. On the plus side, the FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE balls...WOW...amazing! If I had only ordered that...my review would also be 5 stars!Note that I did NOT try the burnt end poutine but one of the peeps in our party did and loved it.All in all, because I live in the hood, I'll eventually give Blackstrap another shot. Hope I'll be able to post a more positive review that time...Cheers!"

Francois at the cash was really cool. I paid with my card and the machine forces you to leave a tip. I don't think that is acceptable seeing as all he does is take your order from a cash register, you have to get your own drink from the fridge, you seat yourself (if you actually choose to sit there) or you take your stuff with you as you leave Don't see why I tip is needed. Pay cash, don't pay with your plastic is my advice. I ordered the ribs with fries, they were pretty good. No complaints. Wouldn't go back unless I want take out. If you want ribs there are plenty of better options in Montreal unless you are limited to Verdun. Don't even bother getting beer here unless you want overpriced crappy locally brewed beer. 7-8$ a beer? You can get Guinness, Stella, Carlsberg, etc anywhere else for that price or cheaper and someone actually hands it to you."

We went there early, because I had read that they sell out early. Everything was still available when we arrived, and the girl taking our order was very friendly. I got the smoked turkey sandwich, and my girlfriend got the brisket. We split sides of the deep fried macaroni and the beans. The sides were pretty good, the macaroni portion was huge and it's presentation was really cool - perfectly square macaroni squares.I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere and the decor is great. But the BBQ is lacking. It really doesn't compare to BBQ I've tried in the States. The brisket was somewhat dry and just wasn't that great. Smoque in Chicago absolutely blew this place out of the water. If you absolutely want to try some BBQ, by all means, give this place a try. But make sure you try some real BBQ next time you're in the states. You won't regret it."

Tried most of  the meats they offer.  The ribs are the best I've tried in Montreal.  They are a bit sweet but not overly so.  The beef and chicken are ok but nothing extraordinary.They also offer a slushy margarita that seemed popular.  Although I didn't try it I can see how it would go very well with the ribs.If you're into ribs definitely a place to go out of your way for.

Once you get over that you could be liking this place ironically and get down to it, the food is pretty good. It is a great place for lunch but the portions are too small for supper. What it does lack in quantity it makes up in quality. the mac and cheese doesn't really taste like mac and cheese it tastes like deep fried cubes that may or may not contain cheese or macaroni elbows. But come on, you are going here for the meat, its great, I ordered the brisket and also the turkey, both were just outstanding. Although I found the portions to be too small they do offer a $35 plate, jury is still out as to whether or not this is a one person entrée or two, I will find out on my next visit. I would definitely recommend getting it to go, unless of course you are enjoying it ironically, then stay and share a picnic table with other people possibly enjoying the food because it is delicious or because it is the new hip spot to be enjoyed by a hipster. Its too small for sitting inside even waiting for your food to go I got crashed into like crazy by people. its pretty cramped. Hopefully sales stay up and they can move to a larger location. I would for sure recommend, its clean, quaint, and above average quality."

Now the slaw goes best shoved into the pulled pork sandwich. The sweetness of the pulled pork contrasts the vinegar of the slaw.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am a big fan of BBQ. Pretty much everyone who knows me will agree with that. Southern style BBQ is not something we are known for here in Montreal but that is starting to evolve. We have recently been spoiled with the additions of Dinette Triple Crown and Diablos BBQ to the local scene. There is now a new contender for the crown which, given they won the Quebec BBQ competition this past summer, may be a mute point.Blackstrap BBQ just opened this past week in Verdun amongst much fanfare in the local food scene. Started up by the former owners of Grifintown Cafe, they are focused on Memphis style BBQ and based on all the pictures and quick reviews I was seeing online, I knew I couldn't wait long before going to try it out and my god was it worth it....I went for a fairly ridiculous amount of food mostly because there was so much I wanted to try and couldn't decide. First off, I went for a pulled pork sandwich, some brisket and the most tempted side they had, fried Mac 'n cheese balls. Yeah.... you read that right. Fried Mac 'n cheese balls. There was nothing on this plate that wasn't amazing. The pulled pork and brisket had great natural smoky flavor and that was before you added your choice of sweet or spicy BBQ sauce. The fried balls were outstanding. Soft and melty interior with a great crispy exterior. I could a bunch of those as a meal.I would have been satisfied with that alone but the special item written on the wall got my attention : burnt ends poutine. Oh baby.... that poutine. Words do not properly describe how great this was. The burnt ends on their own were perfect but you add to that a very good poutine especially the gravy which clearly wasn't an afterthought and you have a amazing dish which made the experience that much better.Verdun may be a little out of the way for some of you but I cannot recommend you check this place out more. As soon as I left, I waited to come back the next day. A sign of the quality and the word of mouth for this restaurant: they ran out of all their meats about an hour after we arrived.... almost 2 hours before their closing time. This was a great experience and one you shouldn't miss out on.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,Elle O.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As someone who compulsively had to read all 70+ reviews, I knew going in that the burnt ends poutine, ribs, and brisket were the most generally well received items. So that's exactly what we ordered. (With a side of Mac and cheese balls -- because, why not?) I really wanted to love the brisket/brunt ends poutine, but it was just a smidge too salty for me. I'm not a big rib person mainly because of how messy they generally are. So what I did really like about BSBBQ was that the ribs were dry-rubbed so while you could add as much additional sauce that you wanted, you could also eat them ""as is"" and they weren't messy, and still had loads of flavour. However, my husband (who loves ribs) only ranked Blackstrap BBQ as second (diablos is first, and le boucan is third) in ribs.All in all, a bit of an uneven experience. We both thought the Mac and cheese was delicious, I loved the ribs and my husband was slightly lukewarm about them, and the poutine was generally a miss. Not likely somewhere we would go again unless we wanted take-out and were in the area. Because honestly, for roughly the same price, diablos has much more to offer in terms of atmosphere, drink options, and location for people looking to ""dine in"" and relax at a restaurant with some friends."

Since I am also Jack Spratt's wife, I have loved every last morsel of flavourful meat in this category that I have tasted.I was hesitant about trying Blackstrap as the reviews are somewhat mixed. However, some barbecue seemed like just the ticket on a wet, slushy end-of-the-world night, when I had nothing in my fridge.He had the beef brisket with greens, and I had the pork with fries, and we shared. It was all moist and tasty, with burnt bits. The fries were also very flavourful and not too crispy or too soft. We particularly appreciated the slaw, which was nicely tart as opposed to the sweet stuff that Montrealers seem to prefer. Neither of us felt the need to add sauce to our meat - unadulterated seemed the best way to experience the flavour spectrum on offer. We washed it down with Black cherry and Ginger beer.We sat at the bar, watching the guys prepare orders. The chicken looked super moist and tender too. Unfortunately they were out of ribs. (FYI, this was a Friday, a little before 8pm.) We'll definitely try the burnt-ends poutine next time.The decor is simple but effective, with two tables with benches that could probably seat 8 per table. Otherwise there's the wall bar and the main bar. There's music that fits the fare, and it's loud enough to listen to but not so loud, it's intrusive. The staff/owners were friendly and helpful, and the overall experience certainly made us want to visit again."

The sauces were very flavourful and spicy means ""spicy"". The slaw was wonderful. Brisket had a great smoke ring, and was cut on the thicker side (my preference) but was a tad dry.

Though I was going to try the pulled pork sandwich, I was warned it was not great. The only thing that was recommended to me was the chicken. This is the worst chicken I've ever had. It was so bad, I only had a drumstick and a few bites from the thigh. That`s not even a quarter of a chicken. It was incredibly dry...and that`s the dark meat, which is supposed to be the juicy part of the chicken. On top of that, I walked in not knowing what kind of service to expect so left the usual amount of tip I would at another place...the only problem was everything was self served.  The only thing I didn't have to do was cook my meal.I don`t know what went wrong because based on other reviews, this place is supposed to be great. I may be a bit confused by the word BBQ because I was thinking I'd get something as though it was off a BBQ, but it tasted very much like deep fried chicken.  I would much rather go to Braseiro for my chicken.

The burned ends poutine had pulled pork.It all sounds impressive, and having read they won some gold medal at some bbq competition... honestly, the ribs were dry, the meat was tough and not fall of the bones at all. That's the most disappointing thing really. then the pulled pork which was moist and good but then some pieces were clearly sliced, which doesn't give it the same texture as pulled...the roast chicken was the only thing I liked, it was moist and tasted good. The coleslaw was nothing special, fries were very good. The baked beans, well it seems they put some sort of herbs in it which I did not like, and they were a bit too tangy for me... There are two bottles of bbq sauce on the table, a sweet one and a spicy one. I guess you're supposed to add it to the meat and eat, so you only put as much as you need... I'm not fond of this set up, I like my bbq drenched in the sauce as it cooks so the sauce permeates the meat, just my thoughts... and yes even with dry rub you brush some sauce on there to finish it off before serving!!! yeah all the meat had no bbq sauce on them!!!  whatchou talkin bout  Willis?The poutine was ok, not enough sauce and pulled pork didn't add anything, was I supposed to add the bbq sauce on the poutine?I was hoping for something good, but even for dry rub, ribs should not be so dry and tough to eat... did I get a bad batch?"

/user_details?userid=-FtDiW0p8Qcd8jnT6PoLow,Mary H.,"Almonte, Mississippi Mills, Canada",1 star rating,"This is dining at its most primitive, definitely not for anyone who cares about how the food they eat is prepared and whether or not it is healthful, but I was eating out with others including someone whose interest had been piqued by the supposed authentic southern fare. With the exception of the chicken, which on this occasion was very good, everything was disappointing, some of it very much so. No one in our party of four found it lived up to the reviews. I'd recommend going elsewhere, but if you simply must try this place you might consider buying some of the chicken--or other meat which might be okay next time since it appears to be a bit of a crap shoot--and taking it home to have with some good, healthful vegetable dishes. Any you choose to make are bound to be better than what you get at Blackstrap BBQ."
