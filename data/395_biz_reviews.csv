/user_details?userid=s9ic-24SmodR6vHfJWysKg,B N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"(Based on online order only)   WOW.  Truly a stellar bakery.  The breads were hearty and dense with crisp crusts and they stayed fresh and scrumptious for a few days after delivery.  The challah was especially delicious.  Their pastries were divine -- the chocolate babka is hands down the best I've ever had in Montreal, same with the pain aux raisins.  Fuller meals (chili, curry, etc.) were also well-spiced and filling without being heavy, with portions perfect for two people.  My very kind and generous relative who put in the order said the online ordering was easy.  I was also very pleased that they didn't use excessive plastic packaging in the delivery (more paper bags than plastic containers).  I certainly am looking forward to visiting in person for more goodness."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Why why why have I not been to Hof Kelsten before?? How foolish! It's always on the top MTL bakery lists. We were driving up St-Laurent and we're hungry. We passed Hof Kelsten and decided to circle back to finally give this place a try. We ordered the croissant, chocolate croissant, sesame almond croissant, chocolate almond croissant, apple strudel and a brioche. My biggest complaint with bakeries is that there is never enough chocolate filling. I know it's because of costs and I understand but I always wish there was more.Well...I couldn't believe just how generous Hof Kelsten is with their fillings! The chocolate croissant had loads of delicious dark chocolate filling! The sesame almond croissant had a 1/2 inch layer of almond filling and a almond sesame chewy crust layer on top! Same for the chocolate almond croissant. Apple strudel was packed with apples and flavor. I could not be happier. Can't wait for next weekend to go back for more!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Hof Kelsten is another boulangerie that's been on my hit list since I first heard about them. They're nearby Melbourne Cafe. The inside is chic and they play some chill Indie pop music. I messed up and came on a Thursday afternoon (Friday they have challah bread). FYI, you can reserve their speciality breads ahead of time. They have bread, pastries, sandwiches and brunch (only on weekends). Lots of people came in and grabbed baguettes to go. - Bialis ($1.50) - apparently, they only make a handful each day but I was able to snag the last one. Great chewy bagel like texture with some sweet grilled onions. The touch of salt sprinkled on top is fantastic. - Pain au chocolat ($2.75) - flaky in touch and tastes better after your first bite. Man, people are so lucky if they live in this area. So many quality boulangeries within a 5 minute walking radius."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"While running errands in the area I found myself hungry and in need of a quick lunch.  That's when I remembered that I wasn't far from Hof Kelsten and that a friend had highly recommended it to me.  It's easy to walk by this bakery and miss it because it doesn't have any large sign out front that easily identifies it.  However, you might know you're nearby when you start smelling the tempting aromas of freshly baked bread.  Start following those scents and you will find it.  The bakery is fairly large inside and seating didn't seem to be an issue when I was there.  The place itself is rather bare and simplistic.If you're planning on grabbing a quick bite they have sandwiches and a small brunch menu on weekends.  I ordered a gravlax sandwich.  It was a little small given the price but it was tasty and the bread was so soft and chewy and very fresh.  I did enjoy it quite a bit.  Alas despite the high quality of the sandwich it was no match for the chocolate babka pain perdu which was simply divine.  Just writing this review has me yearning for another slice of it. It too was so soft, chewy and very chocolatey.  Most importantly all the food here was fresh as fresh can be.The prices were okay and if memory serves me I paid about $14.  Like I said the sandwich could have been bigger given the price but the pain perdu was just right.  The quality was definitely there though and I will most certainly be back to try the other items on their menu."

No matter what you get here is incredible. The croissants are OUT OF THIS WORLD like maybe better than what you can get in FRANCE. Their brunch is also really good - hello CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST.

Guaranteed to be the best decision you'll make all day. I'm a regular at the Guillaume bakery a few blocks up, which is known for their French style breads. Hof, on the other hand, specializes more in Jewish style baked goods. Both are equally fantastic, just depends on your mood. But seriously, everything here is wonderful. Disclaimer I've never tried the in-house brunch (and have heard mixed reviews), but have had my weight in breads, cookies, babka, strudels, you name it. And oh my, this place is good. They also serve up a mad latte here. So grab some raisin bread and bialys and start the day right. Note: it's pricey, but yes it's worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic small minimalist bakery with no name on the outside so you could clearly walk by. What I love about HK is the baked products are seriously some of the best in MTL. I've sampled the chocolate babka pain perdu (glazed with caramel) and also I took a sourdough bread home. The sourdough is the closest thing to SF sourdough that you can get to. Then also we brought back some scones which were buttery, flaky and delicious. One small dissapointment was the cappuccino. I believe it to be some small house indie roasted coffee but I thought mine to be a bit cold and not very strong. Beware not many places to sit and they fill up fast. My next visit will be a whole chocolate babka and possibly some challah bread. Delicious stuff folks. If you are a carb king then this is your royal palace! Check it out!"

Most people come here to pick up things to go, and I think this is the main highlight of this place. They have brunch and coffee which is good and semi-self service with a relaxed environment but it's outshined by the standard pastries they offer. The prices are fair for the quality and the lines aren't ever too long. Staff is kind as well and the place has a nice homey feel in the morning. Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=eoHmSfOX6LgsP8fo4dCLiw,Atessa A.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been looking forward to try this place for brunch for a while as I had heard good things about it.  To be fair,  my rating should be 3,5.  What I liked most and deserves 4 stars was the food.  I ordered the pain doré brunch plate.  The pain doré itself ranks in the best pain dores I have tried.  The fact that it's made out of homemade thick slices of bread and pure maple syrup makes it just excellent.  It also comes with a side of back bacon tasty as they season it. Also had a side of Kale which was fresh and generous.What made me note it down to a 3.5 star is the setting which is very basic and the fact that you don't have a sit down service.  I enjoy cozy and we'll thought out decors and although the small plants are cute, the setting lacks a bit of warmth and comfort especially since you don't get table service as this means a lot of people getting up to get their plates from the counter.  The good news is that both decor and table service can be added and updated to go with the deliciousness  of their pastries and brunch plates. Overall, I enjoyed my brunch very much as it was tasty but might take my brunch to go next time."

Everything is so amazing, as dense as it should be and not too heavy on the fillings and this is hands down, some of THE best challah that I have ever had (am loving the poppy seed and sesame seed mix.) I am a huge fan now and the staff kept me entertained while I waited for my challah to come out of the oven. I will definitely be a regular here!! The latte was also most excellent."

We traveled across the city a second time on our vacation just to have these again (note: only available on weekends).The apricot scone was also incredible. Almost like a cross between a scone and a shortbread cookie (maybe it was the butter...). I would pay a lot of money for this recipe...

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On the Main. Street parking only.The place: I was actually surprised at Hof's size. For some reason, I'd expected the storefront to be teeny tiny. The shop is fairly airy and there's a decent seating area as well. The goods: Fresh bread, cookies and a few pastries. In terms of the bread, they offer a few varieties, such as Pumpernickel, sunflower seed, baguettes, Ciabatta etc. While I did eyeball the Pumpernickel, I decided to go for the Ciabatta because I had big plans to pick up some Italian salami at the market and what goes better with salami than CIabatta? Nothing, that's what. And, as luck would have it, the nice boy behind the counter sliced my bread for me. Score.  As far as the bread goes, you can't possibly get any fresher than this. Typically, Ciabatta is heavy and somewhat dense, not to mention chewy. My loaf? Light and airy and SO fluffy I could have used it as a pillow. In terms of consistency, it had a bit of chew to it and it was perfect. Service: The fellow who served me was awesome and super friendly. He took the time to explain the bread's 'make-up' and how to best preserve it if I wasn't going to eat it all in the same week. However, the chick at the counter, while (eventually) friendly, made me wait 5+ minutes while she flirted with the customer in front of me. I can appreciate the need to talk to cute boys and all that, but do it on your own time. Price point: On par with most bakeries. I think my loaf was $4 , but it was a pretty good size so you'll hear no complaints from me."

The salmon was tasty but the latkes lacked crunch and flavour, and the staff were weirdly strictly against cooking the eggs in the way our friends from our of town requested (all eggs must be runny?

Great location right down the street from Beauty's after you've already stuffed your face over there. They have a great variety to choose from and the babka is absolute chocolaty succulence.

It is located on a very heavily traveled street. We had to park a block away.  This was not terrible because there are a lot of stores to look at on the way.The aroma  of all the baked goods and coffee brewing  make it impossible to order just one item.  We ordered  the bubka and biscottii.  The bubka was so fresh and full if chocolate we felt compelled to bring some back home with us.  The biscotti was so fresh and crisp.  We have been to well known Italian bakeries and I have to say these are probably the best we've had. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because there is so little seating.  We had to wait 25 minutes to get seats.   We will definitely go back.
/user_details?userid=rj0t9ymCScGE3EIyr0_pFQ,Rudhram G.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"GREAT FOOD, QUESTIONABLE SERVICEThe bakery is in a prime location on St Laurent Blvd. By recommendation, I decided to go with the GRAVLAX, a bold smoked salmon sandwich. It is definitely one of the BEST form of smoked salmon i have had. Strong smoked salmon with a layer of lettuce and tomato on soft wheat bread generously coated with cream cheese. The combination was perfect and the sandwich was truly delicious. Being a popular in travel magazines, I would assume that people visiting Montreal would want to try the place out. They are not an exclusive cash only place, but they have some strange issues going on with electronic payment (international debit cards). I was told by the staff that they do not accept credit cards (debit only) and they also do not accept international debit cards (USA). They do not accept payment in US dollars (conversion) and was pretty much only left with an option to pay by cash. Displaying specific instructions on acceptable modes of payment would be helpful. Even after withdrawing cash, there was some confusion among the staff to take payment before or after service. This confusion caused delay in service and sort of left me waiting in line while the food had already been prepared."

With Guillaume just north on Laurier and Hof on Mont Royal, its a carbo-philes dilemna on St Laurent these days!My early review of Guillaume had that as my fave baguette place. Hof Kelsten is competing very closely for that spot. Its a dead heat at this point which baguette I prefer.One advantage Hof Kelsten has is their cafe latte's are great. Totally unexpected for a bakery! They do desserts too, which are on my to eat list, and have weekend brunch.So my preferred baguette genre - Hard crust which is crunchy and moist bread, 80% hydration. Lather it up with butter and nom nom nom!"

/user_details?userid=24PEh_u1nWZDznOwINkgow,Alycia N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The best croissant anywhere in the world. The croissant has a little twang that is intriguing and delicious.

/user_details?userid=_PlVMtt4bwiOAalr1wso9A,Grant H.,"Victoria, Canada",2 star rating,"I finally popped in to Hof Kelsten to try out how they matched up to Guillaume.  I was happy enough to see that the folks at HK aren't merely copying what Guillaume is doing en anglais.  Aside from the utilitarian vibe (cement floors, unpainted/unfinished wood walls, etc.) the two are apples and oranges.I ordered a special club sandwich which was an interesting twist on the classic club: some sort of herb-infused oil (I'm guessing tarragon, there was no explanation) and whole seeds of coriander which, while giving a nice burst of coriander flavour, weren't exactly pleasant to chow into.  There are these rad things called spice mills that could easily remedy that.My wife got a chicken salad sandwich which was nothing necessarily special to write home about.  Hof Kelsten chicken salad = chicken salad.Lastly, the bread.  I'm crazy about bread and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It would make sense that the bread is the specialty here, because it was the most redeeming part of the sandwich, but at 10$ a sandwich, I'd rather just grab a loaf and make a sandwich at home.We happened to come in around 13h on a Saturday, and were the first in line yet from order to reception of food, the whole process took around 15 minutes.  I've worked in plenty of delis and restaurants that make sandwiches and unless the kitchen staff happened to be on break as soon as we ordered, this is a long time to wait for a couple of sandwiches.  For a deli, this is pretty sad.All in all, unfriendly service, long wait, and overpriced fare.  No thanks, I'll go to Guillaume or make sandwiches at home.  If anything was organic or warranted the costs, it'd be a deal.  Knowing how cheap the ingredients must've been, I won't be back."

I had an epi baguette and a rugelach. The epi was crusty and flavorful, so was very satisfying. The rugelach (strawberry and walnut, if I recall correctly), was too nouveau for my rugelach tastes. The filling was a bit sickly sweet and overwhelmed the crust, although the crust would have been good on its own in a different configuration."

/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hof Kelsten is the latest addition to Mile End's boulangerie scene, and it instantly became recognized as a city-wide contender.  Baker/owner Jeffrey Finkelstein built up a reputation supplying many of Montreal's top restaurants with their bread before opening up to the public.  The approach leans towards Central Europe (caraway rye, rugelach, babka, etc.), but Hof Kelsten bakes some French loaves too (including my favourite Montreal baguette at the moment).  They also serve meals (lunch, brunch), but so far I've stuck to the baked goods.  The pastries are generally good, and they're definitely refreshingly different from the kind of fare one tends to find in Montreal's bakery scene, but I've encountered problems with undercooked items from time to time, so now I just focus on their bread."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Over the past few months, I had heard plenty about a bakery right on the edge of Mile End. A place started by a chef who, turns out, sells bread to many of the best restaurants in the city - Joe Beef, Toqué! and Nora Gray to name a few - something that I had never known and that completely blew my mind. The fact that all of these places look to Chef Jeff Finklestein for bread speaks volume about the quality of his product. His new bakery Hof Kelsten now allows us common folk to get a fresh loaf for ourselves.Hof Kelsten is located just off the corner of Saint-Laurent and Mont Royal in what I recalled being an old super club Videotron which was confirmed when I noticed that the overnight return slot in still present with the sticker above it. There is no sign outside and the interior is relatively sparse - unfinished wood counters, a white tile wall, concrete floor and a few spot to sit down. The only indication of the name is the green fluorescent lights shaped into Hof Kelsten above the counter. Behind the bread wall, you can see the large kitchen where all the work is done.Hof Kelsten offers a variety of bread and pastries with a few weekly specials such as Challah only available on Fridays. For my initial visit, I went with a loaf of their sourdough. Now I love sourdough bread - it is pretty much the only bread I eat when in the States as it is readily available there. I have never been able to find good sourdough to bring home here until now. This bread was great - beautiful crust, great flavour and perfect texture. I finally have sourdough bread in Montreal. Thank the heavens!For the bread alone, I will be coming back quite often from here on out but there is even more. They also have a sandwich menu and a number of other items with a strong Jewish influence. Grabbing lunch, I went with the brisket sandwich with a half portion of Matzo ball soup and some latkes. The brisket is served warm with sliced apples, red cabbage and beet slaw with what appeared to be a homemade thousand island dressing all on the house rye. Just a wonderful sandwich. I never would have thought of apples and thousand island dressing with brisket but the combination works extremely well.The Matzo soup was wonderful as well - great depth of flavour in the stock (and surprisingly not as salty as I expected), generous amount of chicken and vegetables in the soup and the matzo balls themselves were great. A perfect addition on a cold December as it was.The last item was the latkes - quite large individually. Great crust on them while maintaining a nice texture inside. The surprising plus was the dipping sauce - a nice sweet addition that offset the lack of actual apple sauce to use instead (Note that I've always been a apple sauce over sour cream guy).All in all, Hof Kelsten is a great bakery that lived up to all the praise I've heard and then some. The fact that I am only a quick bike or drive (or longish walk) away means that I have found my new ""neighbourhood"" bakery. Getting restaurant caliber bread on a weekly basis will be a beautiful thing and something that everyone near and far should run over for as quickly as they can.Cheers!"

Yet, their breads, pastries, and brunches speak for themselves. Who needs a sign, when you're that well known!The decor on the inside is unique, you may think it's under construction, but in reality.. It's not. You step into a world of amazing & fantastic quality breads and pastries, which are also available at some of the top restaurants in Montreal. Jeffrey(The owner) who makes you smile at all times, is one very talented, hard working, and great person. Once you met him, you understand why his pastries taste so well, he puts 100% dedication into them, with the finest & European ingredients. Now onto the staff, when I walked into the store, the greeted me so nicely, five minutes later I walked out with a box full of pastries, and a loaf of bread. The staff was kind enough to hand it to me, and open the door, also asked if I needed any help. All this being said, it left a warm, comforting feeling of wanting to come back again and again. Who needs an expensive French patisserie when you have a warm and comforting Hof Kelsten!"

I was very excited to go based on the reviews here, so I finally went one day and decided to try the ricotta and poppyseed bread twist. It was very dry, not particularly flavorful, just not good. I took one bite and if it weren't for the fact that I was really hungry, would have thrown it away. It was that bad. I might give Hof Kelsten a second chance (that strawberry rugelach looked so good, but then again, so did the ricotta bread thing) but not super excited to."

/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was excited to learn that a new bakery had opened in the space previously occupied by the Superclub Videotron, on Saint-Laurent just north of Mont-Royal.  Designed by super designer Zebulon Perron, the shop itself doesn't give off a bakery vibe when passing by, and it actually took a friend to point out that it was indeed a bakery for me to take notice.  Instead from the outside it looked more like an industrial half finished space to me, reminiscent of hospital food prep areas.  But once I took the time to stop in (rather than just driving or biking by the big floor to ceiling windows), I realized that it really worked once inside.    The counter is long and there are all kinds of breads stacked behind it, and sweets tucked into the display case. There's a looooooong table at which to perch and nibble on goodies.  And those floor to ceiling windows are GREAT for people watching.  I especially liked the fact that they kept the after hours delivery box in the doorway, just in case people forgot the space's old vocation.But was it good?  It was!  So far I've only tried a chocolate danish and a loaf of ciabatta, but I'll be back for sure!  I'm especially excited to go back on a Friday when they make challah bread, a delicious egg bread.  They also make sandwiches at lunch, and I can see myself popping in for a quick bite during summer Fridays, when I'm too lazy to make my own sandwich, or perhaps not so inspired to stock my kitchen with goodies.  The chocolate danish I had was more of a chocolate cinnamon bun than what I would consider a danish . . . and that's a good thing.  The dough was rich but not too heavy, chocolately but not too gooey.  Very very delicious, for someone who takes her baked goods seriously."

The VLT was fatty, chewy veal pancetta between two measly slices of white toasted bread for 8$ plus tax. The coffee was mediocre. The woman who served me was bitter and unsmiling, and rushed me to order. The decor has that unfinished or under-construction look to it which I don't get.

Tastewise however it wasn't crazy special, rather on the bland side. The intriguing sounding sauerkraut-sauce was not really sauerkraut-y..?! Their coffee was good, strong and straightforward. Best thing about this sampling was their breadpudding thingy... The baguette's nice and crispy, but personally I prefer the one from their competition further up on the main... Nevertheless, I will go back for more coffee and try their pastries, croissants, challah and other breads for sure..."
