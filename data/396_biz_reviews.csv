/user_details?userid=qSEsjIiXb-TTua0vLR1-0A,Dominic D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is a very underrated Thai/Laos restaurant. My girlfriend is from there and we go to different Thai restaurants almost every week. She told me thay Kin Khao is now one of her two favourite restaurants in Montreal because the food reminds her of home. Very spicy and delicious. We will be going back again soon and you can find a special deal for a limited time only for this restaurant on mtlarabais.com

Being a huge lover of Thai food and having had the chance to visit and eat in Thailand, I would give the soup a definite 5/5, the papaya salad on the other hand a 3.5/5 since the taste wasn't quite as expected, the yam Thai salad a 6/5 which was probably one of the best parts of the meal. The yam Thai consists of grilled beef, herbs, peppers and onions. The ingredients seem so basic yet the combination is phenomenal. If served in a bigger portion it could an excellent main dish! I am actually going to try making this at home at some point :-) The grilled meat brochette was a combination of chicken, beef and shrimp with steamed rice. It was good but nothing exceptional. Last but not least for desert we had the fried pineapple and it was a great way to end this lovely meal. Overall great experience and service was great. The owner made our experience quite pleasant and our bellies very satisfied."

The ambiance and the decor of the restaurant is kind of in the plain side. We purchased a groupon coupon to come to this restaurant. AppetizerThe calamari plate was tender but a bit oily. The sausage were good.Main mealThe curry had a good taste but I felt like the portion of protein was missing. As for the grilled meats plate, the best part was the shrimp. For the grilled beef and chicken, I have tasted better elsewhere. If you like sticky rice, substitute the regular rice for that one!The groupon coupon was a good purchase but this would be my last time there."
