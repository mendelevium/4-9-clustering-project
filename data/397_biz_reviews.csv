/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place! Solid, delicious, hearty food with some great cocktails, nice servers and a fun ambiance. We don't live especially close to it, but we will go out of our way to come here.I love the prime rib/prime rib sandwich. Flavorful, salty, fatty meat that's good on a plate with veggies or with melted cheese on a sandwich. Can't go wrong really. My husband (who is half British and lived in England for a bit) loves the Ploughman's, which comes with so many different little bites of meat, cheese, pickled items and crusty bread.  It's pretty hearty despite being on the ""peckish"" side of the menu. The chicken tikka masala is also well done if you feel like something else. They have an interesting cocktail menu and changing specials made by great bartenders. Looking forward to being able to come back here for some hearty winter fare when they can open again!"

But it was Crown royal so Courteney barfed . We also ordered the calamari rings and they tasted just like at the M&M restaurant in Kanata! Good thing the beers were 14$ each because Meghyyyn would have drunk 12 . Also the guy with the spider tattoo on his ear has bad breath."

We sat at the bar, my best friend and I, and made fast friends with a couple of men next to us. The bartender was so much fun, regularly jumping in on whatever we were all talking about and making us laugh. The drinks flowed nicely all evening. We had intended to go to another bar that evening, and didn't. We basically closed this one instead. Another experience was for dinner, and the evening food choices are much better than their breakfast!"
/user_details?userid=GT0fU5mmvtDZCNpeK95e1g,Ana Lee M.,"New Milford, NJ",3 star rating,"Coming home from Tremblant, my friends and I wanted to stop by Montreal and eat somewhere so my boyfriend told us about this place and I thought it was promising. There is only Street parking so be prepared to look for a place to park since it's a busy area. When we got inside my boyfriend had made reservations so we were seated quickly. The menu had various options so my friends and I ordered two fish and chips (one with poutine, and one without), Samoa's, chicken tikki masala, steak frites (medium), and Mac and cheese. I also ordered a cocktail which had gin and cucumbers. Very refreshing! So this is where everything went downhill: So my friends steak frites came out and it LOOKED really good... Brussel sprouts and fries with steak. A promising presentation but when my friend cut into his steak it was well done. Looked dry and so he was a little disappointed. We told our waiter that the steak was dry so we ordered a different dish (another chicken tikki masaala), and when my friends fish and chips with poutine came out there was no poutine either. Disappointing. Again. So we had told the chef that we ordered poutine. He said it wasn't in the ticket and took the plate. Came back and said again it wasn't on the ticket and to discuss with the waitress. IMO, I felt like that was a waste of time taking his dish to the back and then not adding the poutine. Luckily, our waitress KNEW she had put the poutine in our ticket so he ended up getting the poutine. The Mac and cheese was my absolute favorite!!! I haven't had Mac and cheese in so long but it was super cheesy, not dry and a great portion to share with a group of four. Their chicken tikki masala was not my favorite. Had a weird taste to it but I enjoyed the fish and chips! Came with mashed peas, tartar sauce, lemon and vinegar.My boyfriend asked for a refill on coffee but the waiter had given him cold coffee when he wanted hot. My boyfriend mentioned it to him, but the waiter just simply said ""it's good right? It's French""! Ummm okay lol..... everyone got a refill on their water but when I asked the waiter simply walked away. I thought that was funny to me.Overall the experience here was.... less than satisfactory... I wouldn't come back here simply because the service was just  not that good. Don't get me wrong our waitress was  nice but the service is not worth experiencing again."

Ordered the mac and cheese and London tea party to share with a friend and it was perfect. I thought the food was so comforting and just plain delicious.I got a lemonade cocktail and that was the only thing I wouldn't get again, and that's only because I'm not a big fan of cocktails to begin with. I'd absolutely come back."

/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This pub never disappoints. I've been here multiple times on different days and even when I think there's no space, they somehow manage to seat us. We were a little sad to not get a table and to be seated at the bar instead. However, the joke was on us as it was definitely more private and as it tends to get loud as the night goes on, we were still able to hear each other and not have to hell across the table.Their menu has many of their specialty cocktails but ask for any other and they'll happy to make it for you, a big 5 star to the staff. The place is always clean and has a cozy pub feel without the overwhelming smell of beer."

/user_details?userid=Z49I8f02Znl6BfK2aO8PgA,Angela M.,"Scarborough, ME",5 star rating,"What a fantastic pub! Stopped here on St. Andrew's Day for some scotch eggs and we were not disappointed. The interior was warm, inviting and lively. The staff was very friendly and efficient. We didn't have just one waiter. The entire staff works as a team. Any of them walking by your table will offer to get you a drink, take your order, clear your plates or bring you a dessert menu. No one said, ""let me get ""your"" server"". It was in every sense of the word a team effort. I wish more restaurants would run this way. It was an amazing experience. The food itself was delicious. We had the scotch egg which had a little spicy kick to it and just made it so much tastier. The poutine with beef was quickly devoured by my husband who ""doesn't like poutine"" (uh huh) and the mac and cheese was just perfect. Would definitely recommend and will be coming back for sure."
/user_details?userid=JRxMs1L6vdBCc447RTgBMA,Michel C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was not our first time to this pub and I would make it my regular place to go if I didn't live across town. But last night was a special time for me. It was my birthday, so my girlfriend and I selected this place for a nice pub supper as they know how to do things right. We both selected the Sheppard's pie with lamb. WOW! It was excellent. The portion was just right and the wine was exquisite. The service was above par and very attentive. If you are looking for a pub that offer good beer selection, good food and good music, the Burgundy Lion is the place"
/user_details?userid=u_89MyNZ3wUz_6J4w1IQeQ,Roy N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to this pub only a handful of times. I went last about a month ago to watch a Premier League soccer game (this pub is great for watching the premier league) and had a blast. The pub itself is pretty nice but the crowd it attracts makes it even better, the atmosphere was just right and if you're into whisky, if I remember correctly, they have the biggest collection in all of Quebec. I personally had a beer, my other friends had the full English breakfast, and they were saying that it was so great, actually one of them is from the UK herself, I know I'll be ordering one the next time I go to watch a soccer game."

/user_details?userid=IbuvokqmHBwhWDpAjUz2Cw,Sepi Z.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"We came here in a group of 12 during the World Cup 2018 viewing party that they were hosting for the Portugal vs. Iran game and it was a pretty fun time! It was extremely crowded so we were lucky to get 1 table and then share half of another one with other people. There are 3 levels and TVs everywhere so you'll never miss a play. The restrooms are on the 2nd floor but they were pretty small and not very clean. The women's restroom door was open which was a bit off putting since men walk passed to get to men's restroom. The bar area was big but it took a bit to get the bartender's attention because of the crowd. My friend ordered the yogurt parfait and she wasn't too pleased with her. I told her why would she come to a pub and order that but to each her own. I got the fish and chips and shared with some people and it got devoured because we were hungry and it was good. You could never go wrong with fish and chips at a pub. Overall, it was a fun experience and I'm not being a super harsh critic since it was packed for the game which meant slower service yet more demands. I'm not sure if I would have come here if not for the viewing party."
/user_details?userid=AIzgm0QYUsy1l42hSPfZLg,Thaina E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cheers to this English pub in Montreal! Now some might say no such thing exist unless you're in England, to this I say...have you visited Burgundy Lion? You can walk there from metro station Lionel Groulx, affordable and nice/relaxed environment. Definitely a bar to come to and watch a soccer but also a place to break bread with friends. There are multiple stories, we were on the main floor but we looked up and saw a second floor which we assume can be reserved for bigger parties. Food is good and the staff was kind, it did take a while for us to get our food but as we could tell, it gets busy fast so expect that but I will say the staff does acknowledge you in your wait:) They also have this adorable patio in the back, so for summer days that might be the best idea to try. I'd say make a reservation, specifically during the weekend and weeknights, it gets busy and crowded fast as it's located in a high traffic neighborhood. Enjoy!"

I ended up not choosing the cocktails on the menu and instead went with a spiced rum and ginger ale. Even though it's a simple drink, it was still mixed perfectly. The bartender was efficient and gave a good service. There's was a DJ playing, so it's not that great for convos though. Overall I'd probably stop by here again another time."

I'm not a huge lamb fan, but the ragu in the pie was really well done. There was a lot on the plate and it even came with a little vinaigrette salad. The yorkshire pudding was a bit burnt on the outside, but it tasted great and had a small side of gravy that was out of the park good.They have an okay beer selection, I had a cider and a red that were alright. Cocktail selection seemed interesting for next time. They also have large whiskey selection.The service was super quick despite it being packed on a Friday night. Music was too loud though, it needed to be a few notches down."

I brought my friend from Toronto to try the place. We were 3 persons. The restaurant was almost empty. They seated us on a table for 2 behind the staircase. I asked kindly to sit on a bigger table. The impolite ""manager"", named Gabrielle,  said all the tables are of 4 seats. I looked around and saw 2 tables of 4 seats, 1 seated with 2 persons and 1 with 3 (like us). She said they came earlier in a very impolite manner. She also said that she was the manager and she decides where people sit. What a way to treat paying customers!!! We left and will never set foot there again."

Great service at the bar, and while there's a full selection of spirits, the choices in beers are limited to macros only. It was a great pour of Murphy's, but I really can get Murphy's just about anywhere.It's a little loud and the place does get rather busy and that's all great.

/user_details?userid=p9Te35pHxuz0S7cI1NtTUw,Eliana M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The pros are that the service is good and they DO offer to replace your meal if you don't like it. The con is that the food ranges from 'this is okay' to 'this is not good'.The first time I came, I had the burger, which was meh. The last time, I ordered the Cornish Pasty, which comes with coleslaw. Google Image 'Cornish Pasty' and you're only going to see pictures of golden-brown, flaky dough...because that's what happens to pastry dough when you bake it. What I got was a pasty made with white, gummy, seemingly uncooked dough, sitting in a puddle of sauce that had pineapple coleslaw floating in it. So, those elements don't go together, which is odd, and it doesn't fit the whole British theme, which is also odd, but to have pastry dough that never felt the heat of an oven goes beyond odd into just gross.  I asked the server if the dough was meant to be this way, and she called the manager over, who told me that that's how they make it and he eats it all the time. Yikes. Hope he gets to try cooked pastry someday!"

But I've had some disappointing experiences lately, some of the staff have left and maybe they kept the standard high. I used to have the Full English but the great spiced potatoes I remember have been hit and miss. Once I was served chips or fries Instead of fried potatoes or sometimes I was served soft black potatoes the tasted earthy. They also serve smoked bacon chunks that are really great but again recently I've had large chunks of fat. 70% fat is not that nice even if is from a smoke house. Lately even the baked beans have suffered - whatever I had last tome was disgusting - super saver beans or something.Black pudding is best Cooked well which it used to be but when it's not cooked enough to dry out a little it's just Slimmy and that too was the case more than once. When this brunch is good it's GREAT when it isn't it's very disappointing, I won't be back for a while. I just hope it regains it's reputation."

This time we went for brunch for Mother's Day. Overall, everything was ok, but the service by our waitress killed the vibe. She is always rushing, and she doesn't take the complete order. She asks for our drinks orders; we order 3 mimosas and she jumps in she says and water for everyone else. No!!! Other 3 persons want to order different drinks. She was horrible listener. We even heard other customers getting upset at her; and told her ""LISTEN"". The waitress told the client very rudely ""I am listening "". Anyway, she did the same thing during our main dish order. I am not sure if due the poor service, that we did not enjoy our food as much as we always do, or the food have been just average. Everything tasted so bland. Some of toasts, and naans were partially burned. The only thing we enjoyed was the drinks. My mom said, she will never come back here. :("

We had a party of 8 so we took what we could get.I started with a Bloody Caesar (which is a spicy Bloody Mary with Clamato instead of tomato juice, if you're not familiar) and for my meal got a scotch egg side and the full English breakfast with poached eggs and crumpets.The bloody was spicy and delicious and the breakfast was huge. The scotch egg came with some kind of horseradish condiment that was surprisingly good. The English breakfast came with thick slab bacon, sausage, blood sausage, beans, grilled tomato, two eggs, two crumpets, the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had, with a delicious ketchup (which was unexpected since I usually hate ketchup- there was something really tasty in this one though).

(It does get a little loud inside so if you're looking for a more quiet spot then opt for the outdoor tables).Nice selection of beer, cocktails and food as well.  Their food is pretty solid especially for typical English pub fare. Their fish and chips is always a great choice and their roast beef poutine is my personal go-to (large portion and a nice take on the classic poutine with a slight spin on the gravy and roast beef and blue cheese added but don't worry it also has cheese curds for us poutine purists !) helpful tip Though, get the blue cheese on the side... it adds great flavour but it's bold so sometimes when they add it themselves they put too much of it on. Their breakfast is hearty as well and is based on English style breakfast, although most breakfast items on the plates are sometimes a little too oily. Either way for any meal you won't leave this place hungry but I tend to prefer their lunch and dinner items to their breakfast items. This is one of my favourite pubs in montreal so I definitely recommend trying to for yourselves !"

To start, Bully Beef Toast ($13)Corned beef on pain brioche, aged cheddar, sweet pepper mix. Oh boy!!! Awesome! The sweet pepper mix comes with sweet onion... The beef is just amazing. My main course was an Angus Burger (16$) AAA Angus burger, cheddar cheese and house chips. What can go wrong with an AAA Angus?! The fries were delicious. I've just missed the mayo maison. My partner's main course was the Cambridgeshire Salad (17$) Grilled chicken salad, Stilton, pears, walnuts.

/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"The Burgundy Lion is a bit of a classic; a healthy blend of class and comfort, stability and fun. Although it is well known among Montrealers, I still thought it deserved to add another positive review to their collection, a review that I am now writing. The pub located on Notre-Dame Street opens late and serves food until 11 PM (definitely a plus for night owl like my husband and I). They've got a good selection of appetizers and good main courses too. Being vegetarians, we usually go for the samosas or seasonal vegetables as an entree, and their veggie burger as a main dish. The veggie patty is soft and seems to be made of lentils and beans as far as I can tell. Taste-wise it's pretty good, though if I had a suggestion to make it would be to add chili or some other spice to enhance the flavor which currently is a bit tame. Their deserts are also pretty decent; the blueberry and the rhubarb pies are both nice. They've got a huge selection of whiskeys; over 500 according to their menu. Adventurous drinkers will most likely enjoy this feature. They also carry beer on tap, cider, wines and cocktails. They make a mean Irish coffee too (and by that I mean good and strong.)While The Burgundy Lion fills up very quickly on weekends, weekdays are usually a good time to go if you're looking for some intimacy and a manageable noise level. Every time my husband and I have been, we've had a flawless service whether the room was packed or not. I recommend The Burgundy Lion without hesitation; they deserve their good reputation."

It's good but I've had better, I'd go for the fish and chips next time, they looked good!As for dessert...you gotta try the sticky toffee pudding that was recommended by my waitress.

The menu was intriguing so we planned to come again for dinner. We made reservations and gave the food a shot. As a bar, this place is wonderful for drinks, conversation, and for watching pretty people. The food was not bad - slightly above average pub food. Interesting menu (we started with the cold avocado and cucumber soup and the pork cheek) but our mains were less impressive. My burger was fine but my husband's roast beef was disappointingly skimpy on the beef. A lot of mashed potatoes though. Sunday roast is a sacred English tradition, people!

And it was lovely- there was a soft snow storm blowing outside keeping the place relatively quiet and the service was good. I had the English Toast with boudin. The crumpets, while great, could not compare with the boudin which was to die for. I don't know why I would eat anything else for breakfast.The humble three stars can be attributed to the moment I looked up from the R-rated conversation about a wild weekend I was having with my friend to see a child no more than two starring at our animated table. I have pretty defined feelings about places that welcome young families and vulgar 20-somethings with breakfast cocktails, and then place them side-by-side.Booze and kids in the same place: it just ain't right, son."

It took about 15 minutes so I ordered a martini at the bar - it was VERY good and the staff were fun to chat with. I ate the burger in my AirBNB and it was HEAVEN! Just the best burger ever.

At this time we could get a table there without reservation on a Friday night. Nowadays it is hardly recommended to book a table if you want to visit in the evening even during the week. Today there are many more options to get a drink at Notre Dame street, but Burgundy Lion remains extremely popular regardless of  the competition.  There is a good reason for the love of the crowds, delicious food in the best tradition of the English pubs that has remained consistent as quality over the years, fulfilling brunches, and ah, oh these crazy cocktails I'm always tempted to try, but the beer choice is so good that it challenges your ability to finally pick a drink. Just a look at the whiskey bottles aligned at the bar brings warmth to your heart, wait to read the long menu, the choice of drink may become impossible.

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"TLDR: Fun pub with great beer and food.Whenever I need a place to go in the south-west, I go to Burgundy Lion. It's a pub that you know you're going to have a good time. The beer selection is great, their cocktails are delicious, and the food is hearty and tasty.I've gone there for both intimate and large gatherings and it's great for both. However, I do not recommend this pub for dates, because if you go on a busy evening there is no way you will be able to hear each other. The servers are normally very friendly and attentive, with very few off days. However, you have to be empathetic when the crowd gets boisterous and loud.Their brunch is also worth a visit, but remember that you will be having a proper English breakfast. If you think the veggie omelette will be a healthy choice, it's not as it oozes out cheese and is coated in butter. For the healthy version ask for it without dairy products, but don't be upset if it isn't as delicious!Overall a fun and tasty pub to frequent."

We called a few hours before and we were able to get some prime seats on the patio out back, which was beautiful and cozy! I loved that they had a screen on the patio, as usually most people watch sports inside, and we re able to enjoy the weather on a gorgeous Sunday morning! +1 Amazing back patio to watch sports on.+1 Great phone service to make a reservation last minute.+1 Had a breakfast menu and lunch menu to satisfy a craving+1 The burger I had was great, perfectly cooked+1 French toast was on point, and the bacon was delicious+1 Alcohol selection was good, but QUITE EXPENSIVE!-1 The breakfast menu.... minus the french toast, everything looked the same, absolutely no variation. I was looking for something a little more varied and unique, the menu can definitely be worked on. Every dish need not have been eggs, with bacon with potatoes, most of the dishes was a variation of those three things.-1 My cousin got a drink, and it was god-awful, we have never asked to return a drink, but we politely asked the server and she blatantly said no. There goes an $9 drink. Although this was sucky, the rest of the service was ok so I won't make a ruckus about it. Putting on my nice face.-1 Brunch is my favorite meal, and they kind of ruined it for me with their lack of variation. Ended up cheating on brunch with a lunch menu, saddest day of my life.-1 Service - WAS SO SLOW.... we weren't too bothered because we were watching the tennis match, but any other day and it would have been painful to sit through. At the end, we actually got up and paid the bill at the bar because it was just taking too long. I would skip this place during peak hours, because the service is a bit painful to get through. Overall didn't hate the place, so I would rate it 3.2 stars, but because we were able to really enjoy the patio and the match I'll give it an extra 0.8th of a star. There you go 4 stars as you will.

Unfortunately, I was pretty full from the Poutine and when the Lamb Shank came my appetite was shot, but still the lamb was really good. It was huge and very juicy. The roasted potatoes were well made as well, not too hard and seasoned excellently. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and it's definitely a good spot to hang out, grab a beer or just get a meal.

The set up was awkward; we waited by the door, not knowing if we were to sit down on our own or wait for a hostess. A few minutes later a server saw us standing and waved down another waitress to seat us. We were seated but the first sign of trouble started; there were gnats and flies flying all around us. Umm, gross. Then it took a while for the waitress to come down. She didn't give very friendly service. Throughout, the service was slow and sporadic. My boyfriend said his beers were just ""OK"". Whatever that means. He ordered the fish and chips. You would think something that has two items would be prepared fairly decent, but the chips were chewy and lacking any seasoning. The fish itself was super oily.I ordered the roast with Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding and meat were cooked very well. This would have been a one star review if it wasn't for those two items. However, the veggies were all cooked unevenly. It was expensive meal for what we both got.I wouldn't return to this place.

I had fish and chips with mashed peas.

The thick bacon is a must and their potatoes are so flavourful with garlic on top. Watch out if you don't like garlic cuz I saw ppl complained about it. To me it's better with garlic.

The main reason is that the people there work so hard and so well. The food is great for pub food, better than many restos.The alcohol can get a little expensive and it's unfortunate you can only buy beer by the glass but I can see a few reasons for that (other than the obvious lucrative aspect for the owner). Waiters are always there to check if you're ok and need anything else and make you feel looked after and appreciated. Quality-price the best place in the entire area."

We were served by numerous staff and didn't have one consistent server. This led to sloppy service. We started off with some mimosas and Caesar's which were delicious. We were told that there would be a 10 minute longer than average wait for the food due to the power outage they experienced earlier that morning. Totally fine. When the food did come out my friend's meals were brought out significantly earlier than mine and I was left waiting for my Arnold eggs Benedict that I had asked for without tomatoes. As I got up to walk into the restaurant to see what was the cause of the delay my meal was being brought out. When it arrived to the table it was cold and had tomatoes. It started to rain and the only server who was working with purpose and focus asked us if we wanted to move inside. We were then brought into a covered terrace. Again with a new change of service providers, our dirty plates were left on our table uncomfortably long. Would not return."

Last Sunday night, I did. And we had a really good time.It's basically just a really good, nice, modern pub. Huge whisky selection, and everything else. We were a group of 8, so we ordered all kinds of stuff. I had bites of samosa, Shephard's pie, green salad, scotch egg, and it was all just AMAZING. Also the drinks were strong, and the service was good. Also, at first there wasn't a table, but we got a 4 seater, and grew it into an 8 seater within the hour. Also, I thought our check would be expensive, but it turned out pretty average to be honest. There are tons of MTL bars selling $8 pints that are super shitty compared to BL, which is nice.I'll definitely return, and chances of going out of my way are higher."
/user_details?userid=9r15-GGBQ4cwNt54tNxMYQ,Nicole G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I traditionally celebrate my birthday at pubs, and wanted to find a new one to do so this year. I had heard nothing but good things about the Burgundy Lion, and being relatively close to home, I thought I'd give it a try. I made reservations for a group of 10 with Toby, and hoped desperately that we were seated near a TV to catch the Habs game. Upon arrival, I was uber pleased to see he had seated us in a ""private"" nook in the back on the left-hand side on the first floor. It's a large table backed by a booth and finished off with chairs, and has its very own TV. I will admit, I put on a special happy dance once I discovered this. The decor is quirky British pub style (mind you I've never been across the pond, so I can't say it's absolutely authentic). The servers are friendly and knowledgeable on the selection of beer and food, and very attentive. And although the group grew from 10 to maybe about 15-16, our server was always welcoming of a new face, promptly asking them if they wanted a drink or something to eat. We requested to have them put the game sound on instead of the music, which they were happy to do (nice touch). The beer selection is a good mix of European and Canadian; loving ever opportunity to try new beer, I opted for a couple of pints of Boddington (described as a cross between a blonde and a cream ale, very good!). To start Danny and I shared the veggie samosas, which had a surprising kick to them; full of flavour and perfect portion size. I had been so excited for fish 'n' chips since I had made the reservations, and of course ordered them; Danny had the Colonial Chicken. The fish was so delicious; flaky and flavourful, and wasn't too battered, so there was a good fish to batter ratio. The fries were perfectly salted and had that desired crispy on the outside, soft on the inside thing going on. Danny, being a big fan of Asian/Southeast Asian cuisine (heck, he is Mauritian after all), had nothing but great things to say about the Colonial Chicken. I had a bite myself and thought it was delicious too. Overall, everyone in our party seemed to really enjoy the food, drinks and ambiance. A side note, it is a little pricier than normal pub fare, but it definitely warrants it. I am a fan and will most definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: Notre-Dame O. The nearest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's about a 10-minute walk from there. The place: Pub-ish, with wood floors and decor, and of course, the standard British bar set-up. They have two floors and two terraces - the one in the middle of the pub is pretty cool and will definitely be worth checking out once they open it up. The layout is OK but the massive staircase in the middle of the place takes up a lot of space and is almost immediately in front of the entrance. The food: I hate to go against the grain but I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's standard breakfast fare and there isn't anything exceptional about it. I ordered The Yank which included eggs, potatoes, a side of meat (your choice - I went with sausage), a side of bread (again, your choice - I got the English muffin) and a fried tomato. As far as the eggs go, I got mine scrambled and they were perfectly cooked - I hate eating runny eggs so am always apprehensive about the state of my eggs - but these guys rocked it. Well, as much as you can rock scrambled eggs. Hot, moist, perfect. The fried tomato was also perfectly cooked and quite good. The sausage were dryer than sandpaper and hard, so I'm guessing they were sitting around for a while before they found their way into my plate. The English muffin was soft and fluffy, though bland, but the biggest disappointment were the potatoes. I mean, I had high hopes for these because they looked and smelled real good! Sadly, looks can be deceiving and these were not only undercooked but lacking in any real flavor. Bummer. I like a good patate with my breakfast. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious AND it had no pulp. I am not a fan of pulp. Service: OK. Our table was visited by a variety of people and it was hard to keep track of who our 'official' waiter was. Granted, the place was busy due to the upcoming HABs game that was about to start. We were playing Boston - this is serious business!Cost: Very decent - the meal was $8 and the OJ was $3.50. I was pretty well-fed for that price."

I really like this place, it's a nice place to meet friends for a beer after work or to watch the game.I like sitting upstairs, I find it a little less crowded and  the downstairs bar has a tendency to feel like you're standing in a hallway but that being said it's still far and away the best place to have a beer in the neighborhood.The lion is also one of my favorite places to grab a bite  I would say everything on the menu is pretty good, other then the fish and chips and the burger which are awesome, everything else is good and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. The service has always been good the wait staff always very nice and ready with a suggestion on what's good to eat or what type of beer to drink. The system of waiters, waitresses and busboys ensures that you get good service even when they're packed on Friday and Saturday nights. The decor has modern pub written all over it, with all sorts of faux British decorations all over the walls. The first floor layout is a little odd if you want to stand at the bar since you will be in the space that serves as the hallway that leads to the back of the pub but upstairs is great and if given a choice I enjoy sitting up there. The only caution I would give, is that if you're looking to have a quiet dinner where you can have a conversation with your dinner companion this may not be the greatest place. It tends to get very noisy in the evening, making conversation difficult without yelling. Drop in on a game night for a beer I know you'll be sold too."

You get fresh food for a fair price and get served with a smile and a joke from time to time. Decor is very simple but nice.

The weirdest and rudest thing is that they are so quick about you paying your bill immediately for what you order and then they take an hour to bring it to you. The service was so slow and the servers were very oblivious. Unfortunately, I ordered Lyle's Yorkshire pudding. Don't do what I did. This place does not know how to make pastries. It was burnt, I had to saw into it with my knife and the middle filling was burnt/cooked out. I was thinking about coming here for high tea. Nope, no thanks. I will stick to Le Cardinal."

If you must try this out, I strongly suggest you order the blue cheese on the side. I wish I had. The service was great but the rating is exclusively for tonight's experience.

I've never once felt less than absolutely stuffed after eating one. Wash it down with a pint of the house larger, and you're set for an afternoon of drinking...The scotch selection here is VERY impressive. It's one of the best in town, which while not what I'd expect from a ""ye olde pub"", is a very nice surprise.While there's not a lot of TV screens, there are enough to catch the sporting event of your choice.

She waited all the other tables around us and behind us and even BESIDE us but ours seemed to be an impossibility.

Even though the place was packed, we never felt rushed to leave, and our server was very nice. Ordered the fish and chips (was told it was a house specialty) and it was decent but nothing to write home about. Fish was two thick (but short) pieces and was quite tasty and chips were a generous portion. (Unfortunately the chips were quite bland but came with a couple of nice dips to give them some flavour.) My main hesitation of coming back here again (for dinner) is that it was very loud. My voice is naturally not very loud and even when I'm yelling at top volume my friends have to lean in a bit to hear me, so I might steer clear of this place at night when a few drinks have made it a bit rowdier than usual."

We were so glad we trekked out here, which was kind of far from our hotel.I can't really imagine any city having better British pub food than the Burgundy Lion. First of all, the atmosphere is so wonderful; very dark, inviting, candles on the tables, a nice wooden bar. Very cozy, which was nice after coming in from a freezing cold street at 9:00 in the evening. We didn't get appetizers, but started with some drinks - I had for the first time in my life ""Cidre Mystique"" on draft, which is a Quebecois cider. It was delicious. The draft beer list is good, and unlike a lot of places in Montreal, there are some ""foreigner-friendly"" brands like Guinness and Newcastle.I had the ""Welshman's Wife"" which is a braised lamb shank in the tastiest sauce imaginable, served with melt-in-your-mouth mash potatoes and sauteed green beans. Everything was incredible. I was prepared for a fatty piece of meat, as lamb shank often is, but this dish was so lean and juicy I could hardly believe that's what I was eating. It was seriously that good. My cousin had the Shepherd's Pie which was equally incredible, served with an awesomely crispy and light puff pastry. We shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert which was ridiculously tasty - one of the best sticky toffees I've ever eaten. We knocked back a couple Jamesons and then paid a very reasonable bill. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal!"

From my pub experience in the area, this is as ""British Pub"" as it gets, and you can tell by what's served on the menu too (various types of braised meat, roast, fish & chips, different meat pie's, and porridge, among others of course).I came with a group of friends, we knocked back a few (great) Irish car bombs, while some of my friends enjoyed Burgundy Lion's selection of Scotch. They have a good selection of draft beers too, my favourites being: Stella Artois, Carlsberg, and Sapporo. They, of course, serve Guinness, among other more 'original' and unique ale's. The atmosphere is great! The staff is friendly and tends to pay attention to their customers, even when it gets loud and busy. You may have trouble finding a table or seats, so the earlier you go, the better, or you just may have to wait. There is a nice outdoor area in the back that opens up in the summer-fall as well!

I asked our server what she thought about the ""Lapin du Colonel"" and she said it was delicious but a bit ""cochon"", as in not on the healthy or light side. The rabbit came fried with a delicious sauce on the side, and a generous serving of the most gloriously creamy Mac and Cheese I've ever had in a restaurant. I had several glasses of orange juice and a glass of white wine (a humble but yummy Sauvignon Blanc) and it was a lovely early afternoon on one of the nicest streets in St Henri!

Admittedly, I'm a little biased towards anything that'll give me a nice cut of beef before noon, but their bubble & squeak is just one of the awesome offerings on their menu. Ranging from about $7 to $15, the prices are really reasonable and the food is well worth it. If you're heading there during the week, the English-inspired lunches and dinners (including Indian curry dishes that add some extra English authenticity) are also a treat, with extra points to the chocolate-chip bread pudding for being CRAZY DELICIOUS (in all caps). Adorned with posters for London events, cricket and football gear and photographs of Michael Caine and David Bowie to watch you while you eat, the decor is just as fabulous as the food. Service is great, too, but if there's a football game on, you might want to expect a wait or at least some very close quarters."

For the day goers, there is a shady spot somewhere if you just want to have a pint and read a book or sit at the bar and watch a futball game.      They do a 'British plate of the week' which I have seen vary from salmon confit with hollandaise over mushroom risotto(British, really?) to braised beef cheek with roasted vegetable(ahhhh, British). Some of the best pub food I have ever had.      The quality of the food speaks volumes, I can confirm, having worked there as a cook, prior to my relocation to FLA. The chef is a great guy who runs a tight ship and the kitchen staff are very 'pirate like' in nature. Between the burley 'strong man,' Corey Cash, the scimitar wielding, beast carving, Marie Maude, Paul, the omnitasking grill man from Waterloo or the steadfast, starboard savvy sous-chef, Matt, the kitchen staff is top notch and pumps out food of equal, if not greater quality.

We arrived at 12 noon and already the pub was filling up.  Great interior, very similar to a British pub/bar in London. The choice of beers was excellent with Guinness, Boddingtons etc etc. Service was fast and the menu is slick and to the point. There wasn't pages and pages of dishes which is so off putting when you only have a short lunch break. Plenty of British traditions such as Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, Ploughmans, and good old indian curry. We ordered the Highland burger with french fries and also the Tikka Masala curry with naan bread. I was asked how I liked my burger cooked which was a surprise to hear for a lunchtime pub so after this question I expected a great burger. Much to say, I was very disappointed. The burger was tiny within a huge bun. It literally sat in the middle like a meatball while the bun remained soggy. It was difficult to pick up and fell apart. The meat was very dry, almost like it was reheated rather than freshly cooked. The tikka masala curry was also very dry, like it was cooked and then reheated in the microwave. There wasn't any moisture in the sauce at all more-so like curry paste stuck to the chicken. I must say though the french fries that came with the burger were the best I had ever had and their homemade sauce was excellent. However $45 for two lunch main dishes, a pint of Guinness and a panache was too much especially for the overly cooked and very dry food."

They also have kippers if you're into that kind of thing. You get so much food and it's so good that it always breaks my heart when I can't finish it. They kept the coffee coming (a MUST) and the service was fast and friendly. Bigger and better than Sparrow on St. Laurent (the other brunch place that does English Breaky) and, although it's always been busy, I've never had to wait more than 5-10 min for a table. Plus little burgundy-- the SW Montreal area it's in-- is so cool right now, and it's only a few blocks away from the Atwater Market. Couldn't ask for a better way to spend a Sunday.

The beauty of a good pub is that it offers a cozy, authentic atmosphere and pulls together food from around the Commonwealth in a competent way. There are far too many ""pubs"" that think they can offer Newcastle and Guinness on tap along with 20 varieties of Molson/Bud and serve burgers and fries. The Lion says ""piss on that"" and has a great bar and food menu!I have tried about 10 things (5 of my own, 5 or 6 friends' dishes) in the past 6 months, and the only mediocre item was the Colonel's Rabbit (the batter wasn't very special....although the accompanying Mac n Cheese was excellent.) Everything else, from the Toad in the Hole to the Colonial Chicken to Lancashire Pot is very nicely done (for a pub....this is not haute cuisine, of course.) The Fish & Chips are very good, although I'd visit Brit & Chips (owned by the same company) if you want the best I've found in town. The Yorkies are excellent (and my personal favourite at any decent pub.)The service at the BL is great, too. Everyone is friendly, has a number of tailored food/drink recommendations, and unlike so many places in Montreal, they clear your dishes and quickly and top up your water regularly, even if that's all you order to drink. Even the security guards (weekend evenings) are nice and will strike up conversations as they watch over the crowds.This place has weekly events and a very clear schedule on their website of when everything is happening. They are also involved in the community. I went to a really great costume party the Saturday before Halloween 2011 that was raising money for breast cancer, and they are also celebrating/fundraising for ""Movember"" for men's cancers.I am not sure if I would frequent this place on a busy Friday or Saturday night, as it turns into a crowded, loud stand-up meat market, but were I 5 years younger and single, I might like that, too.The Burgundy Lions does everything it can to get a 3 or 4 star rating relative to its Montreal counterparts, and gets a 5th star for all the extra effort, the ""don't quite know what"" (the Briton's translation of what we say here, ""je ne sais quoi"") that puts it kings' heads and lions' tails above its competition."

Cute style.  Always open when you need it.  The blue cheese salad is a keeper, if you are worried about the calories, you can ask for cheddar instead.  What I am not sure about: the heavy breakfast and brunch. If thick pancakes and chubby sausages are your taste, then Burgundy is your place.  English style is good.  But for me, might be too heavy.  What I don't like: while there are lots of people there; there's not that much mingling."

We each put our share in with tip and called it a day, why did the waitress (not our original male server) come back to ask if the tip we put was exactly what we wanted to put down??? yes missy it is, did we speak chinese to you the first time when we asked for the bill? No, so go away. Okay so to make an awkward situation worse, we hand her an extra $5 on top of the $13 we had already put down (american too, so enjoy the extra 20cents per dollar when you exchange the currency sweetcheeks), she still stood there and counted the bills in front of us and said it wasn't enough..we hand her an extra $10 on top it and she happily walks away while i sat there in shock like, did that just happen? now, we're not cheap people and will gladly tip the 18-20% but for a waitress to have the audacity to ask for more tip without even checking to see if our service was good to begin with blows me away.

That being said, sometimes I do find it too overcrowded and difficult to find a place to sit or stand and for that, I have to give it a 3 star rating. Many of my friends who also live in the area like to come here after a hockey game, or birthdays are often celebrated here. It has a definite casual feel to it, and everyone tends to give off a good vibe. The staff is super friendly, but on busy nights, it's easy to feel a tiny bit neglected.I've tried many different types of food here, but by far I recommend the Portabella Mushroom Burger. It's filling, not soggy and tons of mushroom goodness! I'd even go as far as to say that it is the best portabella mushroom burger I've ever had (and I have had plenty!)

It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint.

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It was by the luck of the draw that I even heard of this Brittish Pub in Montreal. I was listening at The Montreal Burger Reports' Podcast on Dilallo Burgers. Since the guys needed some hops to start off their review and Dilallo serves none they stopped by Burgundy Lion's Pub and linked to it in their podcast. I took one look at the pictures of their food and thought that if the food is only half as good as it looks I would be plenty satisfied. So off I went for some Pub Grub.At first I was surprised by the look of the place. It's definitely not a dingy musty old pub. It's modern but still keeps an old England feel to it. Extremely clean and I can't say enough how much I love that. The place is crowded and had I known we could I would have made reservations but despite being packed, the service never forgot about us as we drank at a standing bar shelf. We struck gold and got seated in their tiny interior terrace which was a thing of beauty and had a Tardis on the second floor. The owner(s) definitely knows who to keep mens attention by picking the simplest yet sexiest outfit for the feminine section of his service team - the white camisole - it just works.Sadly the service barely handed us the menu and asked us if we were ready to order. Slow down Nelly, we just got here and it's our first time. But she did make a valiant effort to speak French and after letting her trip and stumble for a few minutes we switched to English and began with the house chips, as in homemade Potato Chips. And seriously, I'm ruined. I don't know how I can ever eat a bag of chips after getting still warm, thick freshly fried potato chips served to me. This was a first for me and the first of many firsts for the evening to follow.As starters we ordered the Scotch Egg and Cod Fish Cakes. The Cod Fish Cakes were something I had never tried before but wanted to. Fishcakes are made of - of course - fish and potato mash crusted and fried - yes fried; you just can't go wrong with fried. They served it with a tasty curry sauce. The fishcakes were quite peppery which contrary to my usual tastes, I quite enjoyed. My friend's starter was the Scotch Egg and I suddenly feel the need use a lot of expletives to describe how good this was. I had never heard of a Scotch Egg before and shall never forget it. This was the winning dish of the evening, for me anyway. A Scotch Egg consists of a shelled hard-boiled egg, wrapped in a pork mixture, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. Scotch eggs are commonly eaten cold, typically with salad and pickles but they served it with some kind of compote I didn't care for - the egg alone was just insanely awesome and will definitely be having it as my starter at my next visit - because there will be a next visit.Now for the main course I hit the Sunday Roast, a British classic it seems and foolishly I wanted it because I had to try the Yorkshire Pudding. This was a mistake on my part. Been dying to have a Yorkshire Pudding and sadly I was somewhat disappointed; it tasted like a pancake in the form of a muffin - well I tried. But let's get to that roast, oh baby. I could pull it apart with my fork. It was perfectly seasoned and had this crust on the outside that was bursting with flavor. It also had two sides of veggies and this is where it gets weird. It had a side of beyond delicious roasted roots - including potatoes - and all were perfectly sweet and flavorful from - hopefully - roasting alongside the succulent Angus beef I was eating. And then another side of potatoes, this side is mashed. Sadly it was dryer than the British sense of humor and I fail to see why I needed mashed potatoes when I already had roasted potatoes right next to it. The mash was horrible and the roasted root veg were awesome. I would have gone mad with delight having simply more roasted veggies. The peppered gravy supplied for the Roast and the Pudding was lukewarm. I should have simply complained about this but I did not for some strange reason. There was also some horseradish sauce of which I did not partake because I have no taste for it. But as a whole the dish was great, I consider the superfluous mash a minor faux-pas.For desert I had the Raspberry Trifle. It was kind of a disaster, thankfully I don't go to pubs for desert but on my first run at a restaurant I go through everything. The custard was liquid and bland. The sponge cake was rock hard - not even soaking up the liquid custard - and the raspberry coulis was way too sweet. The whipped cream was delicious.As a final review, the upscale pub grub was overall a hit for me. Fresh Chips, both starters and the main were fantastic with the exception of a few missteps and a seriously troubled trifle I cannot under good judgment give it anything less than a 4 out of 5 stars. I'm already dying to go back."

Food is decent, although a little overpriced. Don't order the cucumber soup (bleh) but fish and chips are decent and their hamburger is good. Service is good, really nice waiters. I would like to try brunch here! Their outdoor seating is a plus!"

/user_details?userid=0SWYxuhyqKBtO2HQ-Rumhg,John H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went to the pub on a Thursday late afternoon. It wasn't busy, just a few other people. I tried their St Henri brew, which was decent. What I didn't like was that the service sucked big time. The bar maid came and took my order as soon as I sat down. She asked if I was eating, I let her know that I wasn't sure. She dropped off my drink and left. I couldn't seem to get her attention for any follow up service. You see I decided that I was hungry. For 20 minutes after I finished my beer I just couldn't seem to get any service at all. She just kept talking to other staff behind the bar.I left and had a sandwich at Toi et Moi instead.Now I thought that this might be an aberation. But my new next door neighbour was moving in today. He said that after he closed on his condo yesterday, he went over for a drink. He found that the bartender acted as if she was doing him a favour in serving him. So that is two experiances in two days. I don't know about my neighbour. But I have crossed them off my list of places to go or to recommend. In fact I would go so far as to tell people to run the other way if they are invited there."

I was definitely not disappointed...I ordered only meals though. But the meals were delicious!! My boyfriend ordered a curry dish, it was a bit on the strong side (pretty spicy, not mild at all) and I ordered the portebello vegetarian burger. The mushroom was soft and chewy, the fries were simply heavenly! I love fries and this place makes pretty good fries. Not too greasy or thick but rather they are thin and still very potato-y. I'd definitely come back to try the beer. Service was really funny actually. Waiter was VERY attentive! Nothing wrong with that but he kept coming back to clear plates but my boyfriend wasn't finished yet! It was a few times that it happened. He apologized each time as well. It was funny. But service was friendly overall. Would come back again for a drink this time...and probably more fries!"
