It definitely measures up to the hype! Call ahead of time or go online to make reservations because it gets busy! There is seating indoors as well as outdoors, seems like you have to be lucky with your timing or patient enough to wait if you want a seat outside. Like with most restaurants during covid, menus are on your phone and there is wifi if needed to access them.The menu was very long and so hard to make a decision! Plenty of sweet as well as savoury dishes. I ordered the dairy free passé Composé breakfast which came with two eggs, bacon, ham, tomato salad, toast, yuka fries AND a smoothie. Although it's pricier compared to other brunch places, the food is on another level and is totally worth it!"
/user_details?userid=RVuGMBDgPegZ7ANlPF2dOQ,Angela G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Passe Composé is always a must when I visit Montreal. It's a small little restaurant on a one way street in downtown Montreal. The food is always excellent. There's honestly not much to say about the food except that it's always delicious. The service is almost always awful, always having to wait longer for service, to get coffee, to order, but they are aware. The food just gets people coming back I always order the French toast which is so crispy and served hot with syrup. Another favourite is the eggs Benedict with pulled pork. I'm allergic to fish but my family is obsessed with their bagel and salmon. Keep Eating, Angela"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I hate to downgrade a review and from my most recent experience here, I found it quite average at a very high price.I came on a Monday for breakast/brunch. I shared the Braised beef poached eggs and a side of panko french toast with my boyfriend. The Braised beef poached eggs (28$) were quite expensive so I was expecting something wow. Unfortunately, once it showed up, the beef was dry, stringy and salty. The poached egg was also slightly overdone and wasn't runny enough. I loved the peal onions and potatoes on the side but they shouldn't have overshadowed the main dish. Overall, wasn't impressed with this dishThe french toast (6$ for one slide) was delish.I had a latte (5$) which was very small and served in a regular water glass so it got cold quickly. It was good while it was hot. The restaurant is maintaining appropriate distance between tables and all employees wore masks. Service was good.I know this place is super popular but I think it is quite overrated. 2.5/5"

All I can say is: go see for yourself. The food is amazingly delicious. The type of food you're done eating and don't feel heavy after. They serve good and fresh smoothies. You won't be disappointed. It's worth the run, the wait and the money. You'll have no regrets walking out."
/user_details?userid=kF_K5t37qlpk1S_brB1Dkg,Alexis P.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"Line was crazy long. But i only waited for about 30 minutes, contrary to other reviews, the line went pretty fast (around 12:30) the wait is a bit longer if you aren't willing to sit at the bar. They had free coffee at the waiting area. It was coffee. Not what i was there for so not too critical of it. I sat at the bar, and. I ordered a red sangria first. It got better with every sip. I had two, and that's all i needed. I had the foie gras poached eggs. Foie Gras - duck liver. It was an odd texture, but once i got used to it, i wished i had more! Came with fruits mix and a small smoothie (which i did not drink because i didn't know what it was until after my meal - silly me) Finished out my meal with apply beignets which were to DIE for. Twas a bit too much food though. I wish i could have gotten a half order or smaller of the beignets."
/user_details?userid=jqqB8hWF8kIrv2-qWt23xg,Kristen L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"We waited an hour in the biting Montreal cold but it was so worth every minute for the meal we had. The place is packed on Saturday for brunch and rightly so. It's well-lit, the tables are spacious, and the food is phenomenal.We had a few of their cocktails, which featured absinthe - boy, did those pack a punch. I had the grilled cheese, which was honestly so good I wanted to melt into the ground after. It was filled with bacon and oyster mushrooms and came with a salad with the cutest dressing container. We also ordered apple beignets, which had apple slices baked into them! They came with a delicious maple butter and were topped with fresh fruit. The presentation was impeccable and it made brunch a more enjoyable experience."
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite brunch places in the city. There's almost always a line and if the weather's decent, I think the wait is worth it. Every dish is made with love and comes with huge proportions. I recommend the passé compose breakfast, as well as their  incredible smoothies - super filling but so goood. Their panko French toast is also a must try if you're craving some deep fried sweet carbs (the best kind of carbs) Despite the busy atmosphere, service is always friendly and very accommodating!"
/user_details?userid=eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ,Donald S.,"Boca Raton, FL",4 star rating,"It seems Brunch is all the rage these days. Who doesn't love brunch?! Well actually...this guy. Love breakfast, love lunch, but brunch never appealed to me. Normally I wouldn't be drawn to a brunch restaurant but with yelp photos being this enticing, its almost impossible to pass up. Le Passé Composé roughly translates to The Past Tense. I haven't the slightest idea what the story behind the naming is, but its a clever one! Although it makes for a cool name, It also brings me back to the pains of French grammar class. Aaaah...grimmer school, to be young and carefree again. Sorry, drifting. Back to the review! Stopped by around lunch time, and as expected, this place gets quite busy. There are quite a few options, including a fois gras Benedict. I've actually never had fois gras, so there is no doubt what I'm going for. There's been a bit of controversy surrounding the French delicacy. Not only is it becoming increasingly difficult to find it on a menu in the States, but the NYC fois gras ban is actually days from taking affect. The presentation of the Benedict is a work of art, magazine worthy. A brioche topped with a poached egg, pancetta, caramelized onions, and of course fois gras. Even the side of fruit was beautifully plated. Decadent is the only word I can use to describe this dish. As far as brunch goes, this is pretty much your gold standard. With that being said, not sure I'm a fan of fois gras. Also had the apple beignets. As beautiful as the presentation was, technically speaking I was not in love with this. The texture of the apple would have benefited from being sautéed until completely soft. The batter also came across as more fritter than beignet. Hey, you can't win them all. As far as presentation, Passé compose is absolutely spectacular, down right over the top! Am I now part of the brunch faithful? Probably not. But If you are looking for THE brunch spot in Montreal, look no further."
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Passé Composé is simply one of the best brunch places around. They have their own take on the traditional dishes, which are always perfectly presented with a side of cute fruits and a mini smoothie (LOVE). If you ever go there: the french toast is a MUST. It's what they're known for! Their version is super crunchy because it's made with panko, and they serve it with real maple syrup. PRO TIP: You can have it as a dish (2 french toasts and the fruits, smoothie, etc) but it's a lot cheaper to get one as a side ($6). Overall I love all of their dishes and have never been disappointed. Last time I got the Pancetta breakfast gnocci, and althought this wasn't a problem for me (i like salty!) the pancetta might be a bit too salty for normal people hehe. Change it for mushrooms if you want to play it safe!Also, have in mind you might have to wait a good half an hour on the line for this place. I never go there starving, and add many layers if it's cold (it might take a while!). Luckily they give free coffee on the line  so you'll be sure to be warmed up. Use that time to catch up with your friends since you'll probably be speechless when the food comes!"

The Passé Composé dish and the 2 eggs with foie Gras was absolutely delicious.Staff were responsibly working with masks on, and there was lots of space on both outdoor patios. We will return for a third visit next time we're in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Le passé composé is my new favourite brunch spot. They really know how to mix it up in terms of brunch food. The menu is very original if you want to try new flavours instead of the classic bacon and eggs. The presentation of the food is lovely. I ordered the foie gras eggs benedict and the fried apple donuts. Every meal comes with a shot of smoothie and two small bowls of fresh fruits. I came in the summer and sat in their spacious terrasse outside, surrounded by trees and full of soaking up the sun rays. The service was good, food came out fast and everything tasted delicious. My friends and I truly enjoyed it. As all popular Montreal staple brunch joints, if you come after 10:30 on a weekend, there is a lineup. Also, the prices are a bit higher than other brunch restaurants, considering the creative menu items. I think it's worth it."
/user_details?userid=-NbeVN5tnwdyYAvdNkKMjw,Dominic B.,"Richmond, VA",4 star rating,"*Brunch Review*I went to Le Passé Composé for brunch while visiting Montreal. We waited about 15 minutes before being seated. It was raining outside but a long line began to form along the sidewalk. I ordered a waffle sandwich, which was delicious. The waffle sandwich consisted  of 2 homemade waffles, maple mascarpone , vanilla bean, praline whipped cream, &  fresh fig. All of the ingredients blended well together.  Service was good for a busy restaurant. Le Passé Composé has a lively ambience during brunch. Expect a wait during prime brunch hours. It's best to arrive before opening if you want a shorter wait. Le Passé Composé is a good choice for brunch in Montreal. I give Le Passé Composé a 4.5 rating."

/user_details?userid=1LErnrJQENwtjQt52itHAw,Naz A.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"This spot is rated as one of the best brunch spots in Montreal so we decided to make a reservation for a Sunday and were very excited to try it! Unfortunately, that excitement soon turned into frustration when we realized having resos doesn't mean much at this place. We were seated an hour after our original time, as was the case for many others waiting there (although they did make it up to us by putting the drinks on the house). They also don't have many vegetarian options so I was a little disappointed at that. These poached eggs were pretty good and the place itself was cute though. Check it out if you don't mind waiting and love meat for breakfast."
/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Waited in line for half hour. As they said,  this place is very popular. If you don't want to wait. You have to be there early. Gladly they offer free hot coffee at the door. It helps to warm up in the cold winter. Also it's a good business strategy so you can order something else than coffee when you are at table.The classic Le Passé Composé breakfast has a golden fried French toast, a standard American style brunch.Personally, I'd try something else. They rural poached egg and omelette are worth to try."

After being seated, it then also takes a long time to get your food. The service is slow. The folks are nice though, and as mentioned the food was yummy. We ordered the famous French toast, eggs benny, and duck confit. Also added foie gras to the eggs benedict! Overall though, it's not yummy enough for the frustratingly long wait times--both to get in and to finally get the food you ordered. Not to mention, it's not exactly the cheapest place to eat."

/user_details?userid=DVevJSUXRG1ddLxHrsTtRw,Michelle C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Having had breakfast all over the US, to Europe to Asia, this is hands down one the best brunch spots in North America, if not, the world.LPC is not the ""greasy spoon"" brunch joint that you stumble into after a drunken night of regrets (although I'd happily eat here with a hangover or not). So come with the expectation that you'll be shelling out more money, but for the appropriate quality of food. (I see some people complaining about the price of things like fois gras benedict...sorry, but if you added fois gras at dinner, I don't think anyone would blink twice at paying $10 extra).I came here for the first time with my then boyfriend (now husband), and was blown away. So much so, that when we decided to have a destination wedding in Montreal, we brought our wedding party for the brunch after the wedding because we HAD to share our favorite spot. I've only ever gotten their eggs benedicts but they are executed perfectly. The eggs are poached well (runny yolk FTW), the hollandaise is creamy, tart and flavorful, and they have unique variations from duck eggs, to foie gras, to pulled pork and mushrooms, frequently served on fluffy slices of brioche and garnished to perfection with microgreens and poppyseeds (I've also seen potato chips and onion rings on top!) The breakfast is served with fruit on the side and a smoothie shot, which is just a lovely touch, especially if you order a savory item. Now, the important part: PANKO CRUSTED FRENCH TOAST. This was a revelation for us. We ordered it because we heard they were famous for it. For good reason. It's so crispy on the outside, but nice and soft in the middle, and words do not do this piece of fried bread any justice. It's buttery and sweet and oh-so-good that we've tried many times to recreate it at home. If you come here without getting an order of this, you are sorely missing out. I'm not one of those people willing to twiddle their thumbs in line for brunch--when I want breakfast I want it NOW. This is an exception. Wait in line. Try the french toast."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Second brunch in a row (a rarity for me) was at La Passé Composé. Never been before but it's close to Le Red Tigre. We dropped in on a Wednesday morning (around 10:30am) and the place was busy. The inside is quite spacious but the terrace is even bigger. Lots of cute picnic tables outside. The menu is split into menu of the week, classics, poached eggs, omelettes, lunch, grilled cheese, sweet eats, kid's corner and sides. Interesting/random that they had ramen on the menu. - Potage ($6.00) - cream of celery root and maple syrup served with croutons. The croutons were over toasted while the soup was rich and creamy but a tad too heavy. - The plus que parfait ($21.00) - homemade gnocchis, wild mushrooms, cipollini onions, arugula, padano cheese and two sunny side eggs. This came with fresh fruit and a toasted baguette. The gnocchi were pillowy soft. The mix of onions, arugula, mushroom and eggs worked surprisingly well. Everything was tasty and the flavours worked harmoniously. I wouldn't eat a whole plate myself but this was perfect to share. The fresh fruit was excellent, especially the small spiced mango pudding.Good brunch spot but this isn't a place you come to every weekend. A bit too pricey for my blood. 3.5 stars."

I heard this place had long lines to be sited and they don't take reservations, it still didn't stop me from going. Long lines means good food. Lol Wait for a table is 30-45 minutes depending on your party and depending on the timing. It's best if you come before 10am (so they say!)Place has very nice decor, friendly service and amazing food. I love that their food menu comes with a little bit of everything like pudding and fruit and all. Their food is so colorful and you know what they say the more color your food have the more it's good for you.One thing I didn't like that was hyped at this place was their French toast, it was a little greasy and dull for me. Maybe I'll try it again!Over all very satisfied and would love to come here again and again to try the other food items."

I've been wanting to visit this eatery for some time, today was the day. Arrived around 12:30 and there was a little line up but didn't wait longer then 5 min. Busy place! As I was mulling over all the choices I ordered a cappuccino. Everything looked so good. Finally I ordered the Fois Gras poached eggs. It's served on a Brioche which is very light and prosciutto topped with the fois gras and caramelized  onions. That was a delightful treat! My friend ordered the ""Plus Que  Parfait which was Gnocci's carmeized onions, pancetta and sunny side up eggs. I did have a small nosh and also wonderful. The highlight of everything was the ""Panko French Toast"" that really said hello to my palette. The staff was more than polite and would definitely return.

We found this restaurant on Yelp (of course) and the food definitely lived up to all of the amazing reviews. We went on a Sunday morning in March around 11am and had to wait in line. The line definitely looked intimidating but we braved the cold anyway. Once you're closer to the front of the line and actually inside the restaurant, you'll have access to free coffee and even blankets! Nice touch from the restaurant.They are known for their eggs benedicts here so I got the foie gras eggs benny. You can pick either 1 or 2 eggs - 1 was enough for me given that it also comes with fruit and even a smoothie shot. This dish was absolutely delicious and I'm going to be reordering this again every time I go. My husband ordered the signature breakfast which came with a *lot* of food. There were eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, fruit, a smooth shot, a choice of bread (white/whole wheat/baguette), and a choice of either a side crepe or french toast. Everything was tasty.Food was amazing, service was decent. Highly recommend."

I've been meaning to try this place out for the longest time. My foodies friends had such nice pictures. Visited on Wednesday morning and there was no line up. I ordered the breakfast and it was the perfect plate. I opted for the french toast on the side instead of the crepe, got my eggs poached, and got white bread. I thought the french toast so unique. It was like a churro! Crunchy, sweet, and warm. Like a giant cinnamon toast crunch. The meat, beans, and breakfast potatoes were great. The little smoothie in the plate was raspberry and was very good. I'd say the most ordinary part of the meal was the eggs. I had them with my bread and they were good but just eggs. The service was excellent! Fast, courteous, friendly. I arrived a bit earlier than my friend and they checked in on my a couple of times to make sure I was ok. I recommend sitting in the back if you go because during winter, the door opens a lot and if you're near it, it gets cold. Even though they have a curtain. Also if you want to go as a group, make sure to get there early because I've heard this place gets packed quick on weekends!"

The line-up is long so do expect to wait in life for a good 30-45 minutes on a lovely weekend. If you want to avoid the line-up come by on week days.

It took about 35 minutes to get a table but I am so glad we waited. One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Get the French toast even if it's just one - it tastes like funnel cake! The grilled cheese was out of this word. Get the ham - the waitress said it was salty and Spicey and to get mushrooms but I thought it was perfect! Also the breakfast gnocchi - ahhhh. Insane - I don't know why nobody has done this before but it was perfect. Wait in line!

We had read reviews and seen pictures posted and could not wait to try the food at the restaurant. We were the first ones (or second) to arrive in order to avoid the brunch hour rush and to catch an early bus to another location. I ordered The Passé Composé Breakfast and my friend ordered the Portuguese styles poached eggs. For the Passé Composé Breakfast, it was almost like a small ""set"", within the different choices that were included, I chose to have french toast, baked beans and french toast. I was recommended to try the french toast by the server as I originally selected crepe instead and it was a great choice. The french toast was crispy on the outside and soft of the inside. There was no taste of egg that was used for the toast and the bread was toasted perfectly. All of the components of the dish were cooked really well and there was so much food. I think it would take two people to finish the eggs, bacon, fruits, toast, home fries, baked beans and mini smoothie (in a shot glass). My friend also enjoyed her dish as well and thought the sausage around the eggs were unique and was very full after finishing most of the dish which also came along fruits and a mini smoothie. Overall, if I ever come to Montreal again, I would definitely stop by again for breakfast/ brunch. The food was amazing and probably the best brunch items I have had!"

Do not get them no matter how pretty they look. The French toast was the star of the meal. So delicious!"
/user_details?userid=Tv_EBrwNtPzgP_F4XoiM7w,Stephanie T.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I had high hopes for this brunch place after seeing a ton of pictures online. Although it was not bad, it definitely did not live up to the hype.We got to the restaurant at around 1:20 pm on a Sunday, with a quoted wait time of about 40 mins. The line moves a little fast as the restaurant does have quite a few tables. We waited half of the time outside and half inside, and they offer complimentary coffee outside while you wait.Unfortunately, we were told that the duck confit poached eggs were sold out for the day, likely as we were basically their last seating. Instead, we ordered the rural poached eggs and foie gras poached eggs. The rural had a delicious creamy mushroom sauce that covered pulled pork and their light brioche. The foie gras poached egg had a generous piece of foie gras on each poached egg, with a creamy foie gras sauce (couldn't taste the foie gras here). I really like their brioche and how their sides aren't potatoes. Instead you get a cute fruit salad and smoothie. The main reason it wasn't a 4 or 5 star review was because the food took ages to get to us, and when it did, it was lukewarm. I felt like it had been sitting out for awhile before it was served to us.We also ordered a fresh pressed grapefruit and orange juice mimosa, which was wonderful.At this price point (one of the more expensive brunches I've had), I would have expected a bit more from the food. Presentation is great for sure, and the concepts they have for their dishes all sound so good. But I do see room for improvement. Would I come back? I don't know, with all the other amazing brunch choices in Montreal, I think I'd try something else first. Maybe one day I'll get to have the duck confit poached eggs."

The woodsy wild mushroom base with the bitter greens and rich, buttery gnocchi were only made perfect with the amazing amount of pecorino delivered on top. Oh and they serve it wth two eggs- how divine.One detail I really appreciated was the quality of the bottomless coffee. They use Zab coffee which is locally roasted and prides itself on an exceptionally different roast. It's the kinda detail that totally elevated the experience.Finally, service and atmosphere were super on point, despite them being super busy. In the same spirit I definitely encourage diners to arrive early (before 10am) so you're not waiting outside forever."

We didn`t have reservations, but the line wasn`t long (we went around 10 am). Street parking is a bit difficult to find given its a residential area. The food will not fail to impress you. I ordered the classic breakfast and my God was this a generous meal for the price you pay for around 20$. The whole works! Eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon, french toast a shot of a fruit smoothie, and more. I couldn`t finish my meal it was so large.

The menus here were in French, however the servers really helped to explain the different menu options.I got the poached egg foie gras which came with a side of fruit and mini smoothie. The wait time from the moment we ordered to actually eating the food was quite lengthy as well. We grew very impatient and desperately just wanted our food to arrive. At long last, the server brings our food and we gladly dig in.The egg sat atop a bed of pancetta chips and fluffy brioche bread. Caramelized onions were also added and really made the dish more delicious. The star of the dish had to be the foie gras. Pan-seared and laid over the eggs, the morsels were well portioned and tasted silky and buttery. I savoured each bite and enjoyed the delicate pieces of foie gras.

We got here Saturday around noon and waited an hour to an hour and a half for a table of 4. They were nice enough to serve tea and coffee while we wait in a courtyard.The meal itself was superb. Food was fresh, delicious and nothing short of filling. The services was meh and the meals too a long time to come out (almost 30 minutes). I swear their english menu is different from their french menu (maybe even the price?).Anyway, would recommend them regardless because their food is delicious."

I love their menu selections- it's so unique but they also have basic items such as omelets, pancakes and waffles if you're not feeling very adventurous. I would 100% recommend trying their poached eggs options. We got the duck confit and the foie grass poached eggs. Both were absolutely delicious. I loved the mix of the duck confit with butternut squash topped with waffle chips. I was very satisfied with the 1 egg option! Both care with a side of fresh fruit and a mango dipping sauce. The portions were perfect to leave me full but not stuffed- it was a perfectly balanced dish. To satisfy our sweet tooth, we got the apple beignet. It came with fresh strawberries dusted in powdered sugar with sides of caramel and yogurt dipping sauces. These were so yummy! The apples were soft but not soggy and it went great with the caramel. On top of the delicious food, everything is so picture worthy! The food was plated beautifully. We also got amazing service. Definitely would come back the next time I'm in Montreal."

PSA: There is a hefty wait time depending on the size of your party. It's best you show up before the opening hour.

Their menu comes with a wide variation, a little bit of everything. The dishes are colourful and easy on the eyes.

We came on a Wednesday later morning and it was busy but a group of us 6 was sat immediately.  Cool decor.  We sat in the back on a big wooden table. I started with a latte, it was good.  The menu had great options from eggs, poutine, grilled cheese so on.  So when in Montreal I decided to order poached eggs and foie gras, similar to eggs benny but sauce is creamy foie gras and topped with fried foie gras.  Probably one of the riches brunch Ive had.  Lucky, I only went with 1 and not two.  The plate also came with a shot of smoothie and fresh fruit.  All meals came with this.  Everyone loved their food, big portions, rich and beautifully presented.  Service was good.  Located just a street from St Catherine (the village).  Great place highly recommend."

I got the legendary French toast, which is crisped to perfection with Panko crumb breading. It was very good, but more of a ""fried"" experience than French toast typically is. I loved the way it was accompanied by a beautiful fruit salad and a tiny smoothie!My friends and I enjoyed our experience so much that we went back again later in the week. The second time, I tried the gaufres (waffles), and they were probably the best waffles I've ever had! Crisp on the outside, positively cake-like on the inside, and generously topped with with fruit. My friends also highly recommended the potatoes."

I've had the foie gras eggs Benedict, duck confit Benedict, French toast, duck confit grilled cheese. Yeah, I really like all things duck. All very good, obviously it's heavy, so it's very filling.

I always go for the classic Passe Compose brunch & skip the bread or the duck confit and/or the lamb confit as they are the safe gluten-free friendly choices but you will see from my pictures that my fellow face-stuffers do not shy away from food (and nor should they!!!!)The only thing I'm dreading is when the weather will get warmer, the wait will be even worse"

We came around 12 pm on a Sunday and the line was outside the door. The people in front of us told us that the line usually takes 1-2 hours, but we decided to wait because I wanted to try the infamous Foie Gras Eggs Benedict. (While youre waiting, they have complementary hot coffee with milk/cups/stirrers outside, which definitely helps in the cold!)Finally after 1.5 hours, we were seated. The service was great, and the menu was extensive. I of course went with the Foie Gras Benny and my bf went with the Portuguese Eggs Benny which came with different sausages and onion rings. We also ordered a side of home grilled potatoes and sausages, which were delicious. The eggs benedict both leaked out perfectly and the foie gras was quicker great (except it had too much salt on it). The cute little dishes of fruit and mini-berry shakes they give you with your meal are also great."

Small groups will reduce the wait time.The restaurant is small sized with around 8 tables  and a long counter bar. The decor was of vintage style and cozy.We had fois-gras poached eggs(P1) lamb poached eggs(P2) and pulled pork poached eggs(P3).They were all well dressed with different sauce. The meat was cooked just right and with the combination of veges and potatoes it created a delicate and subtle taste. That's what made a difference and uniqueness.Also, they have friendly and responsive host and waiters, which made the service quick and enjoyable. However, the food service was a bit slow that we all starved!!"

Maybe we're just spoiled for choice in Vancouver or we've been looking in the wrong places, but we'd finally struck gold with this modern brunch spot. I went with a somewhat classic breakfast dish with ham, bacon, eggs, French toast and a side of bread. I loved how the dish came out with a lot of small elements to it. A shot of the smoothie of the day and a small fruit bowl on the plate. The ham was delicious and the french toast was something else. It was a cross between a donut and French toast with a deep fried crusty exterior. Highly recommended. The pancake was good too. Definitely a place I'd recommend and be willing to return to. Both our dishes were delicious and judging by the way it was packed out on a Fri mid morning, very popular. So plan accordingly!"

There was quite a line up outside Le Passe Compose when we arrived, but it was WELL worth the wait. We got seated a little ahead of others as there were just two of us and were seated at the bar. I was a little disappointed not to be seated at a proper table at first, but actually enjoyed the closeness to the bar as we could chat with the servers and watch them prepare drinks. Menus were offered in French or English and the wait staff were all very sweet, genuine, and accommodating.On to the food... no word of a lie, Le Passe Compose was the best breakfast I have ever had. The attention to detail and effort that was put into each item on my plate was phenomenal. I ordered the chorizo, goat cheese, and spaghetti squash omelet, which came with baguette, a mini smoothie of the day (raspberry and beet, it was amazing), potatoes (so buttery, omg) and fruit. The omelet must have been baked in cheese or something, because it was so cheesy and crisp on the outside, yet gooey and delicious on the inside. I also have to mention the French toast that my boyfriend ordered. It was insanely good. It tasted like a beaver tail on crack. If you're going to get anything, get that. I only wish I could have come here more times before I left Montreal. If I ever go back, this will be my first stop."

I creeped Le Passe Compose really hard before coming and was SO excited to come. Zero disappointment -hands down one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to in my life. I find that a lot of brunch places are overpriced for what they serve. While they serve some standard items here, they also serve some more interesting plates such as the duck confit poached egg I had. It was served with butternut squash, Parmesan, chives, white Porto sauce, and potato waffles. The butternut squash with the egg and duck created such a great explosion of flavours. Also, I'm not a big sauce person but that white porto sauce was A-mazing and I just wish I could bottle it up and bring home a gallon!I also tried their croque madame (rustic bread, white ham, d'Auvergne cheese, Bechamel sauce, old cheddar, poached egg, arugula and endive salad caramelized with sherry). While I am no connoisseur of croque madames I just know that this was a huge potion of DELICIOUS things coming together. The bread was amazing as an added bonus and the pictures speak for themselves because the plating was just beautiful. I wish that this place would exist in Toronto because I would come ALL the time.

My party arrived shortly after our plane landed and they were really nice about the luggage we had on us and found us a space for us to sit and put our luggage down. Our party ordered the duck confit eggs benedict and foie gras eggs benedict. I highly recommend both of these dishes. You have the option to choose between 1 or 2 eggs and although the dish may seem small at first, it's really dense and it fills you up pretty easily. The foie gras egg benny had a pretty generous heaping of foie gras and was seated very nicely and the sauce that topped it went very well. The toast soaked up all the egg and sauce and retained all the flavors of it. The duck confit eggs Benedict was interesting, but very delicious. The spaghetti squash that the egg and duck rested was very well flavored. This dish lacked a little more texture in comparison to the foie gras eggs Benedict, but very smoky and well flavored! Everything also comes with a small serving of fruits and a small shot of a beet and raspberry smoothie. The smoothie was interesting, but refreshing and hit the spot.We also ordered a crepe and French toast as sides. The texture of the crepe was a little too thick for my liking, but to each their own and it was still a pretty good crepe. The French toast may actually be one of the best French toast I've ever had and I highly recommend trying it out.Tips: They do not accept AmEx, but everything else should be fine."

You can choose to have 1 or 2 eggs, and the dish comes with fresh fruit and a mini smoothie (beet raspberry - so good).  Delicious and innovative.

/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here with some friends for brunch on a Monday, to avoid the weekend brunch chaos they seem to always have. Known for their savoury Eggs Benedicts, I had to try their Eggs Benedict with Foiegras, which they offer the option of having 1 or 2 eggs since it's quite heavy and came with a side of fruits and a smoothie shot. As for my other friends, they decided on the Espana Omelette and the Passé Composé Breakfast. Since it wasn't packed, the food came out pretty quick. The first thing I noticed was that their portions were quite generous, especially with their foiegras! The eggs bennie was cooked perfectly, savoury and rich, and the foiegras melted in your mouth, however it felt like my poached eggs and sauce were lukewarm as if they were pre-made and not heated properly. As for the omelette and the breakfast platter, they were quite generous in portion and although they tasted good, it was nothing amazing. Overall, this is a good brunch spot, the employees are pleasant, the place is spacious and the food is pretty good. However, I do believe it's a little overhyped, and is a little pricey compared to other brunch spots (my eggs benedict with foiegras was 26$ +tax). *tip: come early, especially on weekends because it's a popular place, and ideally come by metro, since finding parking can take awhile!"

My table tried a variety of dishes including:Le Passe Composé bagel - generally tasty and similar to other salmon bagels I've tried. However, the Greek jalapeno and lime yogurt was a nice touch between bites of the bagel. Country Poached Egg (Without pulled pork version) - this dish is definitely a unique menu item with the mushroom sauce. A little bit on the richer side so I'd recommend sharing. Dej of the Past Compound - all around a huge meal and probably enough for 2 people. The French toast with the panko is unlike any other French toast that I've tried. It's crispy but soft on the inside. I highly recommend trying the French Toast on a side of part of a dish."

It's very different from the usual brunch places I go to...but the operation management is a bit questionable. First of all there was a 30mins wait when there were several empty seats available, I'm not sure if they didn't have enough servers or they did it on purpose so they have a long line outside. Once we got seated, we order within 10mins of seating yet our food only arrived after 30-35mins. According to our server, everyone is served in a ""batch or wave"". This means that even if you order 10mins before the next table, you'll still be getting your food in the same time the next table orders... which in my opinion is not very efficient for customers. All this wasn't much of an issue rather it was when another server came to take our water and split half the bottle onto the table where my iPhone was. This server was so nonchalant about it & quickly cleaning up the table without apologizing or asking if my iPhone was ok. I mean I would of accepted his apology because at the end of the day my iPhone was ok and accidents happen but he didn't even acknowledge his mistake.. unbelievable.If I was solely rating the food it would be 4.5/5 but because of the terrible service experience I'm giving 2/5."

We waited two hours for the place and under the rain. Yes, we wanted to try it so badly, like a new rollercoaster in Disney World. A lot of the people around us were frustrated, some left, everyone was h-angry. Usually we could see the hostess come out and yell names of people who weren't there anymore. I agree, this place is yummy but no worth more than a 30-minute wait. No need to torment yourself or your loved ones for any brunch. ""You is kind, you is smart, you is important"".  An interesting service is you can enjoy hungry and tired people staring at your plate while you're eating, because the queue is that ridiculous. At least the Restaurant offered coffee to the people waiting before it started raining. Once the rain came everyone looked like a sad stray puppy wanting to enter your house. No, they will not serve you any free tastings for your patience. I had the Lamb Confit Poached Eggs. I guess they tasted so well because I was ravenous, so this cannot be considered as a real grade. You are not going to trick me that easily Le Passé Composé. Their coffee is meh, nothing impressive. You can easily find this or better-quality coffee in Montreal. The only ray of light were the apple beignets, I have to say they are the only reason why I would ever return to this Dantish Circle of hell. If you enjoy anguish, try this place on a Sunday. If you love yourself come during non-busy days like other comments suggest, or just arrive extremely early. I am cheerless to say that I will remember this place for that awful service rather than for those beignets, which were absurdly good."

Although I wasn't expecting it, it didn't surprise me. If anything it only hyped me up (who waits for food that isn't good?). I would ballpark the wait to be an hour - dress warmly!! The better part of the wait was outside. I was offered the option of a table or the bar and I chose the table. Menus are offered in both French and English (blessed). I ended up ordering the duck confit poached eggs and a side of French toast. The entree comes with a side of fruit and you have the option of choosing one poached egg or two. The French toast was mouth watering - truly. I don't know how they make it but it's definitely not the same as what you would get in the States. Staff were super nice!! My waiter was able to offer me suggestions and continuously made a point to check up on me even though it was crazy busy.  A great experience to kick off my day. No regrets on brunching here. I'll definitely be back for more French toast."

I am also reuniting with friends that I haven't seen for long time. Fantastic place to reunite with amazing food. The service is good. Our waitress was announcing the specials and notifying there is one crumble left. I jumped to it; and said I would have that. We also ordered Mimosa(mix of orange and grapefruit juice). Delicious!!! My other two friends got the French toast and pesto/cheese omelette. When our food arrived, I was awed by the beautiful presentation. I was also impressed with their choice of fruits. Usually, for any breakfast place, the usual fruits are cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, banana...but at Le Pasée Composé, the choice of fruits are exotic, like figs, dragon fruit, and blueberries, with toppings of lavender flowers. I had three glass of 1)warm peach with vanilla yogurt 2) crumbles and 3)berry smoothie, and on the side toast, spread of Ricotta cheese, sprinkled with chia seeds and lavender flower. Just by writing the description; I can taste the food again. One word: Succulent. My friends loved their dishes immensely.Amazing place... I want go back ASAP."

Although its just slightly pricier than most brunch places, the food and quality make up for it. Every dish is like an art piece and the flavors melt in your mouth. I've had the gnocchi, which was great, and their poached eggs are amazing. Their homemade fries are also unlike any fries I've had. They know how to complement flavors very well.I'd definitely say to give this place a try - just be warned that there might be a lineup since its a very popular place."

You will know you at the right place once you see a huge line outside this brunch spot. Paid street parking is available outside this place. [SERVICE] - 5/5Our server was friendly and efficient. Once we finished our main courses and 4 different servers gave us updates and ensured we would get our dessert promptly. [DÉCOR] - 5/5 Rustic and small yet simple and clean. [QUALITY] - 5/5Yes, this place lived up to the acclaimed ""Sophisticated French bistro"" title. The high-quality and fresh ingredients made the dishes taste SO GOOD! [ORDER] - 4/5- Passé Composé's Breakfast - $20.00: I ordered over easy eggs and they were cooked perfectly. Bacon, sausage, cooked ham on the bone were deliciously smoky. I tried creton (a pork spread) for the first time. I put it on my baguette and it was nice and savoury. French toast was life-changing! It was deliciously crisp on the outside and the sweet egg flavour soaked all the way inside the bread. Also comes with a mini smoothie and fresh fruit. - - Smoked Salmon Poached Egg - $16.00: English muffin was deliciously topped with fresh slices of smoked salmon, and a creamy béarnaise sauce. Also comes with a mini smoothie and fresh fruit. This dish is very excellent, I would highly recommend it. - Apple Beignets $9.00: I was slightly thrown off because I thought this would be a pastry but it was actually just deep-fried apple slices covered with dough. The ingredients were fresh, but I feel like the crisp apple and deep-fried dough did not complement one another too well. [OVERALL] - 5/5 Definitely my favourite place for brunch. I really enjoyed the fresh Smoked Salmon Poached Egg and Passé Composé's Breakfast. Along with the ambiance, this place is the definition of ""good food, good company, and good times."""

So the second time around, I made sure to do it right haha. Right after my friends and I arrived in Montreal, the first thing we did was find a place to eat and one of them found this cute place on Yelp! The staff was very nice and they asked us if we spoke French or English because they had menus in both (which was a plus!). That way all the non-French speakers who visit don't have to keep asking the waiters and waitresses what each item on the menu is.I ended up ordering an egg benny with pulled pork, and shiitake mushrooms. They give you the option of one block of toast or two. I knew two was WAY too much for a small person like me, so I went with one which was the perfect amount! Especially with all the other sides that they give you! Mine came with a shot of raspberry smoothie and lots of fruits. My boyfriend got the ""Lamb Confit"" with two brick toasts, a shot of raspberry smoothie, and some fruits. Two was definitely too much even for a big guy like him, so if you're ordering, I'd definitely opt for one brick toast.Overall meal was very good! Can be a bit messy, but definitely good. The only reason I gave it a four instead of five was because the sauce was definitely a bit overwhelming for the both of us. If it was less than pictured, definitely a five."

We ordered the pulled pork poached eggs and the veggie poach eggs (menu of the day). The veggie one came with fresh brioche and perfectly poached eggs. The veggies were a mix of small cut seasonal veggies. Both dishes came with fruit & small shot of a smoothie. The smoothie was too sweet for my taste buds. Everything was delicious though & beautiful presentation.

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We arrived at 12h Saturday to a long lineup of hopeful brunchers. It was a bit cold, so the stand of free, hot coffee and milk outside was a welcoming sight. It took a whole hour to get seated, but we were in a good mood and excited to see for ourselves what Le Passé Composé was all about. We were lucky to sit in a corner, next to the large windows, the D.R.E.A.M. table for picture-taking foodies. Unluckily, we waited another whole hour after placing our order, and ended up receiving our food 20 mins before closing time. That didn't really sit well with us.Nevertheless, the food looked impeccable (we got the ""Rural Poached Eggs"" and the ""Passé Composé Breakfast""). The plates were coloful, the portions were generous, and everything was well prepared. I think they ran out of the mango, because we got raspberry shots instead. The poached eggs were probably the best I ever had - the sauce was rich and creamy, the pulled pork combined well with the wild mushrooms, and the thick slices of toast underneath covered with pesto. My boyfriend's breakfast platter was perhaps less exciting, but still a solid amount of food. The potatoes were underseasoned, but the ham was delicious and eggs were good. His favorite part was the French toast, which he smothered with maple syrup. I would go back (they have quite a number of delicious-sounding items on their menu), but I'll make sure to get there at opening time to avoid waiting."

The location is so pretty with big windows ,cozy comfortable and elegant all at the same time. The staff is exceptional , so welcoming and helpful and always attentive ! while the pricing is a touch higher than your standard brunch place , it is so very worth it to splurge on this place :)  we ordered coffee (1 latte and 1 cappuccino with coconut milk) , the coffee was prepared with care and really hit the spot , great flavour. I ordered the poached eggs with brioche bread , pulled pork mushrooms and fruit and everything on the plate was absolutely perfect ! the bread was fresh the sauce was so delicious , eggs perfectly poached , tasty wild mushrooms and flavourful pulled pork you can't go wrong ! It also comes with fresh fruit (great quality unlike the sad fruit some other places put on the plate and pass it off as fresh fruit assortment) as well as a shot glass of their mango like smoothie -which by the way was so fresh and vibrant ! I enjoyed every bite of this dish. My boyfriend ordered the classic passé Composé breakfast (Panko French toast, eggs chorizo, bacon , potatoes , fruit , ham cooked on the bone , little smoothie) obviously I had to sneak a taste of his dish as well (if anything at least to satisfy my chorizo addiction !), chorizo was meaty and authentic so tasty and the ham was delicious as well ! the panko French toast which cAme highly recommended was excellent ! Nice and Crispy on the outside and fully and moist on the inside. The quality and care put into preparation of the food and the level of customer service was really noticeable. The portion sizes were beyond satisfying, without sacrificing quality for quantity in any way , you will not leave hungry !

A poke with the knife sent the egg yolk oozing onto the brioche and mixing with the foie gras sauce. The fresh fruits were vibrant and provided a nice contrast from the rich flavour of the foie gras.  Poppy seeds on the cantaloupe was a nice touch! My only comment is that the eggs were a bit too vinegary.  Passé composé breakfast was also impressive with its tasty, filling components. Delicious food, excellent presentation, great experience."

We went around 10 am on a Wednesday, service was fast and great. The menu was in French and so was the server but when he noticed we were more Anglophone... He easily switched to English. The food was delicious and nicely plated (instaworthy) I must say the winner part of the dish is definitely the panko French toast. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sweet but not overly sweet. It was absolutely amazing! The dish also came with a sample size of the smoothie of the day. Today, it was mango lime which was very tasty. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and my friend and I definitely had food coma. We were full until supper! Price: le dejeuner passé composé: 20$"

I came on a Sunday, it was very busy and there was a hour waiting so i left and came back on Monday, ""less busy"" day. We arrived around 10:30am and it got very crowded few minutes later. So back to my experience...it was NOT disappointing!!! I was pleased with the quality of the plates and the originality of them. We tried their famous PANKO  french toast with maple syrup, simply delicious, the fact that it is fried, you get a nice crunch bite instead of a soggy toast. We had 2 for starters so for the main dishes, we ordered 2 best sellers: fois gras benedict eggs and duck confit benedict eggs. Both choice were excellent!!A big fois gras piece on top of each egg,brioche bread, caramelized onions and the cherry on top...fois gras sauce!!! The foie gras could have been slightly more salted otherwise...delightful! For 25$, it is a steal! Usually you get an appetizer with 1 piece of foie gras for that price elsewhere, i had 2!:)The second plate was egg on top of butternut squash purée with duck confit, very generous, a nice mix of sweet and salty, very nice flavour profile and texture with the potato waffle for the crunchy.Every dish came with fruits and a smoothie shot.I gave it a 5 for the originality of the food, the service and because i will definitely come back!"

Egg benedict was SO GOOD! Generous amount of sauce, meat, and mushrooms! One egg was enough for me because it was huge! It also comes with complimentary fruits and a shot of smoothie.

Although the place was jam packed, neither the flow nor the service were impacted. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly and we got our orders within a normal amount of time (drinks and food). The food was; well, it was delicious. I'm not much of a sweets kinda gal, but the waffles with fresh fruits, caramelized maple apples and caramel sauce were amazing. My friends all chose savory dishes (eggs benedict with duck confit, croque madame and more eggs benedict) and they all loved them too. Our freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit mimosas were also delicious, along with their beautiful lattes. Overall, it was a great brunch experience, even though we had a long wait.

Generous serving sizes, fresh ingredients and well flavoured. The French toast was crispy and the maple dressing complimented it perfectly.

My friend couldn't stop talking about this little brunch place after she went for the first time, so I naturally found myself waiting in the rain about a week after. We went on a gloomy Sunday morning, but that didn't seem to have shortened the line-up at all. Inside, all the tables were full; outside, about 20 people were shivering in the cold. Luckily for us, we only waited about 30 minutes in line, and we spent a good portion of it sitting on the bench inside and trying all the iced teas. Because we were three people, we somehow got a table faster than the groups of two. Not sure how that works, but I wasn't going to question it. For a place that was so busy, service was surprisingly good! We already decided our orders while waiting outside, so we gave them to the waitress immediately after sitting down, and our food came around 15 minutes later. The food, oh my god. Hands down the best french toast, omelette, and potatoes I've ever had in my life. It's been said about 500 times already in the reviews before me, but you have to try that french toast. I got the foie gras and an extra french toast ($5) with no regrets. My friends got the omelette (massive) and a traditional(?) breakfast plate. Both came with baguettes and potatoes, and all three plates came with a smoothie shot and fruit. Thinking about it, I've started drooling again. I could wax poetry about how amazing it was, but I think I'm just going to go back this week."

However, we also had the Croque Madame and a side of French Toast and they were both awesome!  So if all you care about is Eggs Benny, L'Avenue may still be a better choice.

After that long of a wait and starvation, I don't think I could rate any meal more highly than 3 stars. Anyway, I ordered vegetarian poached eggs, my husband ordered some omelette (espanol or something) & our friend ordered LE DEJEUNER DU PASSÉ COMPOSÉ which came with 2 eggs of his choice, bacon, bread, & French toast.The poached eggs I ordered came on two muffins & although I really wanted to like them, I didn't really enjoy them. They looked lovely but I don't think I'd order them again (I prefer the classic ones with hollandaise sauce). Maybe it was the spice they used or something that put me off. The husband's omelette was okay he said but our friend really enjoyed his breakfast. The French toast that he was served was excellent! (I'd order this definitely if I visit this place again). Another plus was that all the meals were served with very good portions of fruits & a small fruity drink. The presentation of the food was lovely too (mine definitely looked better than what it tasted).Overall, I'm not too happy with this place. Maybe it was the extreme wait which killed my appetite or whatever, but I'm not visiting this place any time soon. It was pretty pricey too, my vegetarian poached were $22, which is more than L'avenue or Faberge and the likes."

Very small table PROS: Best breakfast you'll ever have You'll never look at ordinary french toast the same again We went around 11 on a Saturday morning. The wait wasn't too bad but I went back on another sunny Saturday around noon and there was 25 names before me. We shared the panko crusted French toast. I need to pause because it was too damn good. Crunchy yet moist. Pure Perfection. Then we had two different types of Benedict egg. One had pulled lamb and the other foie gras on a brioche bread. I can't even.

/user_details?userid=V0umP22W0LoHyj3ZJ24_Mw,Sofia N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favourite brunch spots in Montreal. I am warning you, if its winter time, you better dress warm, because that won't stop those crazy line ups! I have not tasted anything bad on this menu and Ive added some photos here of my favourite plates. Their breakfast gnocchi is very inventive and unique compared the basics made at typical brunch spots. I also love their poached eggs plates, the Rural one is my favourite, but I also love the duck confit one. The Rural is pictured here, its a poached egg on brioche bread with pulled pork, covered in porcini sauce. Last but definitely not least, THE AMAZING APPLE FRITTERS. Those fried apples are to die for and come with a delicious sucre a la creme sauce (I literally finished it with a spoon). 5 STARS."

We can on a Monday and had to wait about 10 min but just as others stare, it was very well worth it!!!  The portions are huge so come hungry. I got a matcha latte which was delicious and cell blended. For breakfast, I got lamb Benedict which was soooooooooooooooo delicious!! The flavors were amazing and lamb was cooked and marinated perfectly. This would definitely be my go to place when I visit Montreal again."

It is super light, flavourful and melts in your mouth. It is not covered in egg or greasy at all. The little smoothie and the fresh fruit accompanying it was a wonderful addition. The place is extremely lovely, the staff are friendly and if I ever stop by Montreal again, I will definitely be back."

I ordered my favorite Benedict with Foie Gras. What arrived to the table was RUBBER. I was so focused on the company I was sharing the meal with that it didn't register at the time. But see the photo below please. It's appalling. And what's worse is that the waiter, the same one that was aggressively trying to up-sell me by adding an order of french toast then tried to tell me that this was the way it always looked. If that's the case then it's even worse. He and the chef and the expediter  should all know better. Shame on the management for allowing this to happen especially on a signature dish."
/user_details?userid=qTNtPlpssXaheDc22W0ibA,Jolene H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Best brunch in a while - even compared to the many spots in New York.Table for 2 on a snowy day without reservations at 10am. No wait at all though the place was already relatively crowded.Service was always attentive and friendlyThe selection is great! We ordered the grilled cheese with escargot (great crust with an amazing mushroom sauce) and duck confit poached eggs (fruit side was a welcome taste after a rather heavy Bene dish - eggs were perfect and the duck confit with sweet potato mash was great complement) We also shared a side of Panko french toast - amazing! It's not traditional for sure but the crispy batter with the maple was a delight. Not to mention the soft Centre. Overall a great brunch place and we'd definitely return!

Not a ton of variety but if you're looking for interesting spins or ""something different"" for brunch, this place is perfect. Quite decadent (smores waffles, chicken and waffles, gnocci with pancetta, etc) so I wouldn't go here weekly. Also a bit overpriced so I also wouldn't recommend it for people who want something simple like scrambled eggs and toast."

Everything is made with care and tastes delicious. They know how and what to pair with different foods to make sure that the flavours complement each other well.PRICE: Price was a little bit more pricey than other brunch places but considering the quality that you are getting, it is worth it.

We didn't wait very long since it was only 10 am. We came just in time because the wait time. Was massive shortly afterwards. It was nice that they provided water and tea for those waiting. We shared the duck confit grilled cheese and the smoked salmon bagel with pano encrusted avocado. Two thumbs up! Coffee was so so and the wait for the food was really long. Still worth it though! I'll be back.

/user_details?userid=TBJXsWwL7CQ1FVb8OB89rA,Jassy M.,"Luis Donaldo Colosio, Playa del Carmen, Mexico",3 star rating,The presentation is lovely but the prices are not. This brunch places charges on average 20-30$ for each plate. The taste is hit or miss depending on what you order. The duck confit poached eggs are very good but also very heavy. That being said it is french cuisine. Like French cuisine it is overpriced for the portion size. I would say it's a nice place to go every once in a while but it is a bit overhyped. It looks better than it tastes! Line up calmed down around 2pm for those who hate lining up! L'Avenue is still my number one brunch place in mtl.
/user_details?userid=SBcVvcxwXYeT8-SInst58A,Michelle S.,"Dummerston, VT",5 star rating,"A fantastic brunch that stands out in a city full of wonderful restaurants. We waited about 40 minutes on line, and it was worth it. It is a small restaurant, but the ambiance, and staff, are warm and friendly, so it didn't feel as tight and crowded as it looked. There is only room for about 8 people to wait inside for a table, and as we were waiting inside, the line began to grow out the door. There were English menus available up front, so we grabbed menus to peruse while we waited for a table. The menus choices at the restaurant were different than the menu choices online, so I was glad I didn't get too attached to what I'd already selected. Everything we ordered was delicious: coffee, savory entrées, and sides of fries and french toast. The fries came with a decadent and tasty aioli style dipping sauce, and the french toast was fried. The waiter recommended the french toast; he said the restaurant is known for their french toast. It was crunchy, but not greasy. The small fresh fruit sides that came with our meals were welcome additions, and so were the tiny smoothie shots. Ours looked and tasted like mango, so based on other reviews, it seems that the smoothies, like other offerings, may change seasonally."

We put our name on the list and was told there was an hour and a half wait. The host was rather nice. He said that we could head over to the patio to wait and have some free coffee while we waited. We asked to make sure that it was okay if we left after we put our name on the list, he said it was fine. We had to make sure since some places in NYC don't allow you to do so. Our waitress was really sweet, helpful and attentive even with a packed house. I got the omelet. It was soo good. It was more than enough to share with someone else. It was really cheesy which was great for me. The home fries were delicious. Two of my friends both got the Rural Poached egg. The bread was a bit much for them. They both stated that it was just too thick of a piece, but other than that, it was tasty. The other girl got the grilled cheese. One opinion on the bleu cheese was that it was overpowering for her tastes. We got a side of the French toast on the recommendation of the waitress. We are really glad we got a slice of it to split between us. It was really sweet but I was quite fine with that. I didn't need to put the syrup on it. Overall, we really enjoyed our brunch here. The staff was fantastic. We would recommend this place even with the long wait. It didn't hurt that the host was easy on the eyes."

Ordered the apple fritters, bacon/cheese omlette, and a piece of French Toast. The apple fritters came with a caramel sauce that was so good, I couldn't get enough. I ended up putting it on the French Toast and probably should have drank the rest haha. So damn good. The French Toast was as advertised: crispy and delicious. The omlette was also unlike anything I've ever had, slightly crispy on the outside (from the cheese I think), and a fluffy, cheesy, bacony filling that was so incredible, I couldn't stop eating it. The home fried potatoes that came with the omlette was also really good, although needed a little salt. Can't wait to return to Montreal and this will be my first stop!"

The hostess was very accommodating even with a long line up, she took our request to sit by the window (for better lighting for photos haha)Ordered 2 egg bennys one with foie gras and the other with pulled pork and shiitake mushrooms. Amazing presentation and tastes great, maybe because we were starving and walked for 45 min and waited for another 45.A bit disappointed with the ""mango smoothie"" that day. Totally did not taste good even though it looked good and was pricey.Great ambience, great brunch spot.Side note: I guess it was my bad for taking too long to eat - was just snapping away at the food.

They plate their food, BEAUTIFULLY (this is what I'm obsessed with the most about this place). When I went on a Sunday, the service was slow, which I knew it would be, but I felt it was a bit too slow. It did take a while to get served and waiting for the food was a little longer than expected. I personally felt the food looked way better than it tasted. I went with 3 other friends and I got to try a bit of all of their foods but it just did not wow me. I've thought of giving this place another try but I know I just didn't enjoy their food as much as I wanted :("

We ended up waiting for 1.5 hours, which I don't think is justified for ANY restaurant unless it's the top restaurant in the entire city... I was so hungry once the food came that I wasn't sure if I was able to taste everything properly, but I tried the foie gras eggs benedict, and the foie was delicious.There was about 5 small pieces of foie, and I enjoyed the fact that the bread on the bottom was thick cut and soft; perfect for dipping into the foie gras sauce!They are really good at presentation, and seasonal fruits were split into two small square cups, and a shot glass of their smoothie was also on the plate.The dish itself was better than average, but NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait; I would of waited 30 minutes max.We literally finished our food without talking in 15 minutes since we were all beyond hungry. Atmosphere is really cozy and decorated nicely; there is also patio seating. The servers seem stressed though, probably due to the many clients staring expectantly at them, waiting for their food to arrive.Perhaps going right when they open would be a better idea. I went at 1:00PM and didn't get the food  until 2:30PM (and 2:30PM is when the kitchen closes for brunch)! Bottom line: better than average and beautiful for pictures, but be prepared to wait!"

I had the poached egg champêtre (brioche bread filled with fried oyster and mini shiitake mushrooms, and smoked piglet shoulder accented with porcini sauce). It was served with a shot of smoothie and a side of fresh fruits. Their dishes are quite generous and the price is affordable as well. The service was good in general. Kid friendly since they have baby chairs. They offer brunch all week, which is pretty great since there aren't many other places doing that."

Lots of people already waiting in the ""waiting area"". There was coffee in the waiting area but it wasn't very good - nice touch though. We waited for an hour until we were seated at a table. Ordered immediately as we had an hour to look at the menu. Waited for another hour until our food finally arrived at the table. While waiting for the food I finished my cafe latte served in a water glass - hipster coffee beans with too much acidity and no body. We ordered Caspro poached eggs and foie gras poached eggs.Food makes great Instagram picture but did not taste good and definitely not worth the wait. Both plates were served with a white sauce which had a vinegar taste. Both me and my boyfriend agreed that the sauce did not compliment the dishes. Bottom line - if all you care about is taking Instagram photos then this is a perfect restaurant for you; for everyone else it's nice to try this restaurant on a day where you don't have to line up just to see what everyone else is talking about.

I've had most of the items on the menu and nothing is bad, but here is the underdog that a waiter once enlightened us with: two sandwiches that get over looked: The Grilled Cheese Gaspor and The Innovative Grilled Cheese. My fiance and i now order a Croque-Madame or one of the Poached Egg dishes and split it with one of the Grilled Cheeses, trust me you will not be disappointed! The hours are super limited.

I got here early on a Saturday morning at around 10:00 am and was seated right away. The design of the restaurant is more of a long bar shape. It is quite cute inside with a bar as well as small tables. I had the deconstructed pancakes which were a deepfried breaded banana on top of a crepe with nutella, coconut and almond. It was served with pineapple around it and had quite the tropical flavour. My friend had one of their omlettes with potato and the portion size was quite large. The brunch here is on the pricier side around $18-22 for most things but they have good strong coffee to keep you buzzed. The service can be slow when it gets a bit busier and by 11am there was quite the line inside the restaurant.

I always get the passée composée dej, which has eggs, sausages, bacon, your choice or bread, a shot of fruit smoothie, fruits, beans and to top it all off, their panko breaded french toast.

We went on a Sunday at noon, and waited for an hour to get in, and another hour to get our food. This is quite disappointing. We wished the service was a bit more accommodating, for example, bring our drink orders earlier rather than along with the food almost an hour later. And be more efficient in seating people to move the queue along faster. Some tables have 2 people taking up the whole 4 seats. Now that the rant is over, I can get back to the food. It was quite awesome! I ordered poached eggs with ham, oyster mushrooms and mushroom sauce on brioche bread. It's basically eggs Benedict by another name. It also comes with three small bowls of fresh fruits and smoothie. The ham is meaty and the mushroom complements the dish very well. Overall it was very delicious!

I did so some research before coming here and everyone said to come before 9:30am otherwise it'd be a long wait! We ended up coming here around 9:45 and we had to wait for 45 min although waiter said 30. It's nice how there's a waiting area outside the restaurant and they have complementary self serve coffee. Only down side is no tent for the waiting area. So if it rains your out of luck. The restaurant is known for the Benedict's in which we tried 3 different kinds (duck, foie gras and pulled pork with mushroom). Loved the duck one- definitely a twist to the basic egg benny as they use sweet potato instead of the bread. Also thought the pulled pork one was Delish as well!"

We came Osheaga weekend (risky, right?) but showed up at 9:00am and beat all the line ups and were served very quickly and efficiently. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and mushrooms. It was very tasty and filling (i got the two eggs option). They were cooked beautifully but I can't help but feel that something was missing. A bit of seasoning maybe? My friends all got the same thing, the salmon bagel avocado sandwich. They all enjoyed it but none of them could really finish the half of the avocado that was put into the sandwich. It was deepfried - but very lightly breaded, and the avocado texture/amount was a bit overwhelming (I tried it myself). If you're an avo toast kinda person then you'll probably enjoy it. The service was extremely friendly and I would definitely go back and try more of the menu."

Although the line up was a bit long when we went there at around 1, I think it is still worth the wait. Will revisit next time when we come to Montreal. :) We both ordered two classique ones and both were good. Mine is the Plus One Classique (probably not the exact name), love the beans!"
/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was definitely worth it, it is not the reason why I'm leaving a bad review. It all started with a line up outside, which was expected. After 30 minutes of waiting outside, we get inside where twe still had a few people in front of waiting to get seated. Then... THEN. This guy -that was mainly on his phone- comes to us and say '45 minutes to wait MINIMUM' with the emphasis on the last word. No 'hello good morning' or whatsoever. His eyebrows were raised as if he was expecting us to leave after waiting 30 minutes and being told this. It was also surprising since there was only a group of 4 people before us. We said we would still wait. Then he dgoes to the back of the line and invites everyone to wait on the terrace with a cup of coffee. Nice way to treat us. After 30 more minutes, he comes back to us and points a table without a word. Wow.  asked if there was some space on the terrace, since more than one table were empty inside the restaurant (and yes, we still had to wait...). He said 'no or you'll wait more, whatever you want'.We decided to take the table he so nicely pointed. After that, the waitress was super nice and the food was good. But only because of this individual, I would not go back. Is he the owner? If so, big thank you to your cooks and waiters for doing a great job because they're saving you. You have no manners."

The portions are almost too big. I had the vegetarian omelet with pesto and goat cheese. It came with potatoes, choice of bread and the best side of fruit! Typically the side of fruit includes a strawberry, some flavorless cantaloupe or watermelon. Here it came with strawberries, orange, grapefruit, pineapple cherry tomato and earth cherries! We also ordered the Panko encrusted French Toast, The Three Cheese Omelet & Homemade Waffles. Everything was delicious-the service was great and the atmosphere had a really cool vibe.

Then the waitress came and told us about 5 off menu items only available today! You people are killing me! No wonder there is a line up around the block! I opted for a rabbit poached egg. It was so rich and decadent I could only eat half. I felt bad for the poor rabbit I was wasting. I also tried their beet smoothie which was one of the best I've had.    Everybody at the table was in heaven with everything they ordered. You must try this place!"

The restaurant is so adorable, very retro, very pleasing to the eye. Let's talk about the best part: the food!! So delicious! I had their foie gras egg Benedict and wow...blew my mind. Presentation was spectacular, served on a wooden tray. I judge restaurants, specifically brunch places on their poached eggs and this one did not disappoint one bit. We also indulge a bit and had their sugar crêpe, it was the cutest and sweetest thing we had in a long time. Few things to keep in mind, the price is a bit up there, for good reasons, it's great to get a group of friends out there and/or maybe on a splurge day (trust me, it's worth it). They have a patio, so come ready to enjoy the sun and if not, you still have indoors, also, it is located off the Beaudry metro, maybe 4 mins to get there?! With all that being said, please please please find your way there and enjoy a nice brunch with family, friends and/or yourself :)"

Then I read Yelp reviews for 15 minutes, and decided I should hide at home, where food is a minute away, and, not, two full hours.I panicked. I texted we should abort the mission, and since my fellow bruncher is calm and cool-headed, he decided we should try it out first, and retreat if needed be. By god he was right. We showed up at 1pm on a sunny Saturday and were seated in less than 10 minutes, praise be! The service is decent, the decor is Pinterest, and their terrace is more like a bunch of tables in a garden. Still, with a one-track mind, we both ordered ""Le dej'"" and it was delicious. It has it all: meat, egg - very good when scrambled, fruits - fresh, potatoes - soft and greasy, as well as a little scoop of beans and a tiny glass of cranberry coulis. That's delicious in itself. But you know what's good, so you'll order it with the french toast, which is made of brioche, and breaded with panko. I rolled my eyes forever at the reviews here, but I must admit they are well-deserved: that must have been one of the best slices of french toast I've eaten. I recommend eating it with the cranberry sauce. There were some less cool things, like a ridiculously small quantity of maple syrup (how else am I gonna eat my ham?), or the fact that the bread doesn't come with butter. Or jam. Just like, slices of bread y'all. You won't care, you'll be tonsils-deep in french toast."

(I expected a line out the door, since that was what I read on Yelp, but we were here off-season so I guess that's why).We started off with Mimosas (duh!) and these were great, served with a little fruit skewer on top. I ordered the waffles, they came out and it was a giant tower, brussels waffles size (but not the same texture) with about 2 apples worth of sauteed apple slices. Despite being intimidated because of the huge amount (I have a european size stomach...) it was delicious! It came with a yoghurt sauce and this made the whole dish taste amazing!My mother had the poached egg with ratatouille and she finished the whole plate, which means it must have been really really REALLY good, since it is a rarity.My boyfriend had the deconstructed pancakes with panko fried banana and homemade nutella and he didn't complain either. I had a taste (because that's what boyfriends are for, right?) and I loved it! And my brother had a grilled cheese with raclette cheese and this was also great, for those people who like savory breakfasts/brunches.All in all I would for sure recommend this place if you want an instagram-worthy plate and are willing to splurge a little on brunch/breakfast."

The coffee is now refill-able and the server actually comes say hi within 5-15min to take your order. 2. The lineup is still huge but at 10:30am, it was still easy to find a table for 2.  3. On the variety side, the menu is now 3-page long with choices as creative as before. 4. The taste - grilled cheese with canard confit / pulled pork - are both beyond 4 star! What I don't understand is the sauce. The grilled cheese is flavorful enough and they have an extra bowl of bbq sauce for it. The salad is seasoned but they put a range sauce at a side. Also, they threw extra range sauce on top of pickled cabbage that's already good by itself. If you're a light eater, ask to put all those fatty sauce at the side or order something less heavy than grilled cheese (if that exists here! lol)."

/user_details?userid=T9qlXCOZZ38CD8MhmqHONw,David C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Best brunch ever. Legit. I've had loads of brunches joints in NYC, but this one might be the best one. The workers were really nice and friendly. The food came rather quick and the portions were no joke. I recommend coming early on the weekends (around 9am) or else you'll have to wait. There is a good amount of tables, but it'll fill up quick. Will def come back when I'm around in town."

I went there because I've heard a lot of great things in the last few months about this place and I was pleased with the service, the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Would highly recommend. I had the egg with foie gras (my girlfriend had the same because that's what Yelp folks recommended)."

However, due to high traffic, you can sense the staffs enthusiasm to get you out of your seat as quickly as possible which makes the experience a little less enjoyable. However, no complains with the food. You MUST try the French toast, you won't regret it!"
/user_details?userid=AH5fjjZwxoLpYPalHEGC7w,Aditi S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,By far the best brunch place I've been to- everything from the food to ambiance and service was amazing! We ordered 7 dishes and everything was perfectly plated and delicious. There was a bit of a wait but I'd say worth it. Will make a trip to Montreal again for this place
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Surprised at how good this restaurant was... the problem is that it will be hard to go to other breakfast joints after trying this one. The duck grilled cheese is delicious. The panko french toast is a must. The smoked salmon bagel is served with fried avocado... just one of their very original and inventive ideas that distinguish them from your standard breakfast fair.

/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Le Passé Composé is the kind of place that you get excited about coming back to, before you've even finished your meal. Their duck confit-egg-squash-mix-up (not the official name) is without a doubt the best brunch I've had in months, and I've eaten more brunches in the past few months than I can count. Add in the phenomenal service, despite chaos in the kitchen and a huge line up, and you've got a recipe for one of the best brunch spots in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=rHM25EqklUW33QeHc0GD_g,Bea C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2 star rating,"The wait time for everything was way too long, especially to get a table. If I'm told the wait is 1h30M okay that's fine, but if you say it's 45M & it ends up being 1h30M that is not okay. It ruined our day plans. The host did not know how to quote time or organize his ""wait list"". Food also took a long time. Once we finally got our food it came out plate by plate. My food was lukewarm at most. The French toast is  overrated. It's very oily; although, I did enjoy the crunchy texture. Our server was very nice & the food was good despite the temperature."
/user_details?userid=dJXddegF0qe2FmTQVRi7KQ,Eytan P.,"Roanoke, VA",5 star rating,Absolutely incredible. Sit outside in the garden on a nice day. Friendly waiters. Delicious and innovative food.

/user_details?userid=LL6aMkzWhxuy0R0N8UIuyA,Kyle B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Eggs benedict with style. We had ours with foie gras and it had a fruit salad on the side.

I obviously didn't leave a tip. I'm never going back again."

/user_details?userid=7Nq-eNN9v2-7PDQNLbg3Zw,Catherine L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday after finding it on yelp. I love the plateau area and this cozy brunch spot is another reason why. There was no line but not sure if this is the norm. The place was not too big and seemed to be a garage before which is common of many restaurants here. The colour scheme is quite simple with blocks of red and white and just a few trendy pieces. The menu was organized into three main sections: savoury crepes, sweet crepes and eggs Benedict. I automatically narrowed in on the eggs Benedict and ordered Le Bleue which has blue cheese, walnuts and prosciutto. I'm usually not a big fan of blue cheese but decided to be adventurous that day. All eggs Benedict comes with a tray of yogurt, fruits, fried potatoes, and coffee. Just looking at the tray made me happy and opened up my appetite for the main. The blue cheese was definitely more palatable with the prosciutto and eggs but I have to be honest, it got too heavy by the end so just a warning if you're not a huge fan of the blue. I also tried the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which I would recommend as well, you can never go wrong with smoked salmon. All in all, I had a good experience and would recommend you to check it out especially if you want to avoid the long line ups at the other more popular brunch spots."
/user_details?userid=138PInfkVHaWWvSR7hKyQg,Lauren S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered the Spanish omelette and was not disappointed! It was so hearty and delicious! The portions are also big, so go hungry. The staff is friendly and helpful. We also shared a portion of the French toast topped with some maple syrup which was like a sugary donut of goodness. There is also a large outdoor terrasse in the summer. Definitely a spot to bring some friends or family who are visiting from out of town. I'd advise you to go early though as a line does form quickly."

/user_details?userid=Ys4kiZ0DmuZqNi-zWcgbwQ,David M.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,Exceptional food. Expensive but refined dishes. They need to get their placing system organized. The free coffee for those who are ind the waiting line is a great idea but someone has to refill regularly.
/user_details?userid=4kn0qzjg6VvYUlCes2wShA,Ismail R.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,One of my favorite brunch spots in Montreal. The mood is great. Staff are super friendly. I had the Portuguese poached eggs which were perfect. Definitely a must visit when in MTL.
/user_details?userid=zV5RtkBRlCQMyufu3gjN0g,Anne N.,"Quebec City, Canada",5 star rating,"We have been there a few time for lunch and it is one of the best place in Montreal to brunch! The wait could be really long, so just pick your time wisely as in...get there at the opening. However, it is worth the effort as everything we got there is just amazing. The decor is nice and the staff is really welcoming even when there is a lot of clients. For drink, we had an americano and a grapefruit fresh squeezed juice that were really good. For the food, we decided to go for a grilled cheese and oeuf benedicte au foie gras. Both were to die for. The cheese in the grilled cheese was generous and they are using Gaspor bacon. The foie gras was amazing as well as the bread in the oeuf benedicte plate. Definitly one of our favorite brunch spot in Montreal...we we get there before the crowd."

/user_details?userid=aTqWnYJMqSPo73RPT_wFVQ,Elham J.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Checked out this place today for the first time with my brunch buddy. I'd heard so much about it so my expectations were quite high. We waited 45 mins to get a table, and about half an hour to get our food.. I got the duck confit poached egg, it was tasty and the presentation was nice also. I found it not worth the price though, it was $18 for one egg and even coffee was not included (extra $2.25 for coffee- regular price). I think it's a nice place to try once, but I find it too noisy and expensive and not really worth the wait. I don't think I'm going back."
/user_details?userid=IQOtaoMh3aungfRcNIYtLw,Warren R.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely one of the best places to get brunch in Montreal.  If this place has one problem, it's that you won't be able to choose what to get.  Also the number of veg-friendly options is limited but what they have will make you happy.  The staff are very friendly and keep up with you no matter how busy it gets.  One more thing; come early!  The lineups get long after 10."

The food was delicious everything they brought out looked so good. Definitely try the french toast. And to top if off, our waitress Melissa was the best!

The foie gras Benedict was divine, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their versions of Benedict. Great and friendly staff, too."
/user_details?userid=tZGvhhYxGa718fkMu0rayQ,Joey S.,"Timmins, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was phenomenal. Although we waited in line for about 20 minutes on Saturday morning, between 10-10:30, there was self serve coffee outside and it was actually GOOD! Once we got in we were sat at the bar, something I've never done at breakfast before (at least before 11 AM). We were three people and it was a little loud, but we still managed good conversation while catching highlights on the French sports network. I ordered a cappuccino as it seemed like the appropriate thing to do, and it came in a bar glass. A curious choice of cup, however it tasted great and I felt more ""hip"" after consuming it. When I ordered ""LE DEJEUNER DU PASSÉ COMPOSÉ"" and asked for a crepe instead of French toast, the waitress asked me if it was my first time here.  I said yes, and she told me to go with French toast as the restaurant is known for their French toast. She wasn't lying. This breakfast  was fantastic... But the French toast was out of this world! Don't even think twice about getting it. Actually, you may want to think twice... After eating it, you'll likely never enjoy another order of French toast anywhere else. So it's on you if you want to take that risk of ruining the French Toast experience for yourself. I'm not a big French toast guy so I was all in on this. Despite it being incredibly busy the service was relatively fast, the food was well cooked and well presented. Oh, and you can also get a baguette as a toast option. If this doesn't scream Montreal for a tourist, I don't know what does."
