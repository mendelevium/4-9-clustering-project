/user_details?userid=mRBvkaiHbx00zwPxsw0nmQ,Jenna D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Bowhead is a wonderful restaurant for vegans and meat eaters alike. It's a beautiful environment with creative cocktails and delicious vegan food. I have been 2 times in the past month! I recommend the ""chicken"" wings, the ""chicken"" wrap, the animal style fries, and the cesar salad. Delicious and fresh tasting, at a fairly reasonable price (for its quality). I also recommend the white sangria or the mojito!"
/user_details?userid=iWzPSLFouc0lCvet2iHudA,Sunny I.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",5 star rating,An absolutely fantastic experience!! We went there on a Saturday night and karaoke night was so much fun! The service was nothing but spectacular and it made our entire evening so memorable!We had the animal fries and it had so much flavor which I loved! Definitely coming back here again
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I am really happy that Montreal finally has its own proper vegan pub. Once me and my crew knew that Bowhead had opened its doors we were on a mission to visit and eat an obscene amount of vegan junk food. And believe me, we did just that.Above all my favorite thing about the experience was the appetizers; we ordered both the chicken wings and the frito pie. Both were delicious but the frito pie was absurd- they give you a FULL SIZED BAG OF FRITOS. We definitely brought home leftovers.Other aspects of the visit had their ups and downs: the Bowhead burger was a good but standard beyond meat burger- my companions also thought the pretzel bun was a little overkill. It applies to the burger but this is also a general critique of the plates- why so heavy on the vegan cheese? We all had vegan ""fake"" burps for hours after: go easy on the orange stuff.Service was generally friendly but kind of all over the place. It took us twenty minutes to get our drinks (it was not busy) and staff generally seemed kinda confused. All that being said, this spot is brand new so I assume that the service bit will get ironed out with time.Finally, the space is charming but it seems overly posh for the menu (although definitely not for the prices). I'm not turned off by the decor but maybe I was expecting something a bit more down home for hot dogs and frito pies, you know?"

/user_details?userid=Tc8kPSCcssmo8knLe2pTLA,Helen C.,"Saint Leonard, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,1. it was a little overpriced in my opinion2. The set up in the restaurant was a little awkward. We took our food to go.3. It all had a weird taste. My boyfriend enjoyed the chili dog but it tastes like frozen food. The burger was bland and didn't taste the bestThey forgot my order of fries.The animal style fries were okay. Probably wouldn't go back
/user_details?userid=XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,Vanessa F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went here shortly after they opened. The service was good, but I found the food just OK, and the interior wasn't very warm or inviting. Still had an under construction look. I liked that they didn't advertise as a vegan pub. Just a pub that happens to be vegan. I would try again -- perhaps they've improved."
/user_details?userid=VxZpJsYFV4eOK_3TM-u42w,Remila O.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"Came here once a couple of months ago based on the recommendation of a fellow vegan friend, as we were looking at the menu outside a male  hostess and someone who seemed like a shift supervisor made a ridiculous comment about my friends body so we quickly left. I still wanted to try the food so i came back recently and accidentally stumbled upon karaoke night. It was funny and we stayed, our food was great had the ""animal"" fries, mexican salad and the chicken wings. definitely had a better experience however some old guy kept aggressively asking our table to give money for karaoke even though none of us sang? Besides that my only down take is that it is  extremely expensive for pub food i paid over $16 for a chicken burger that was the size of if not smaller than a junior chicken at mcdonalds.two stars just for the food, ill definitely come back to try more hopefully not during karaoke."
/user_details?userid=yq7WkHQK4CEi5vD-8yNYvA,Caroline S.,"Florence, NJ",5 star rating,We ordered the spicy wings and they're easily the best vegan wings I have ever had. Excellent service and sweet music selections. Will definitely be back.
/user_details?userid=SYZJCVFVT5cqDPZB9OgFXg,Joe R.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I love good vegan junk food (e.g. MeeT in Vancouver) but unfortunately bowhead pub did not deliver. The anml fries were cold. The wings were slow to arrive, over cooked, dry and tasteless. Way overpriced for the quality of the food. Service was slow. Would have given 2 stars but the atmosphere was nice and my wife enjoyed her chicken burger."
/user_details?userid=knCg1M9Gf4v2-95YzAG4DQ,Paul L.,"Greenfield Park, Canada",5 star rating,"I was here today in the late afternoon and missed the $15.95 lunch special for burger (or hot dog) fries and 10 oz beer. My friendly hostess (and lovely) suggested the Captain Burger $17.95 and it was served delicious! If I didn't already know from a recent Montreal Gazettte review that their patties are Beyond Meat, I would've mistook it a good beef burger! Instead of fries, I opted for the Caesar salad with a glass of Sleeman Blonde. My tab, taxes in, tip not included was $31.56. Nice new decor, good pub feel sitting at the bar.  I'd definitely come back again"
/user_details?userid=vpPC9AFqPSEPeMBnymX47A,Veg V.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"A great plant-based corner pub with delicious vegan poutine, good wine, and a fantastic vegan waitress originally from Italy who made the experience so much more enjoyable, which is why we returned."

/user_details?userid=vuORS4y112V4CPwWaKR8xA,Reigan M.,"Saint Louis, MO",1 star rating,"Myself and two family members walked in not knowing this is 100% vegan food (it was not clearly advertised) and we ordered a hotdog, chicken wings and a taco salad. I'm not sure why the menu is so meat-heavy if they are serving meat, but this is the worst meal I've had. In fact, all of our meals were terrible. I've had many vegan meals in the past, and many good vegan meats, but these were confusing to eat and had bizarre flavors and textures. They also generously throw Fritos on many of their dishes, which is odd to me. Our waitress there was good and very friendly to us, and gave us some great travel recommendations. With that said, I would not go back."
/user_details?userid=lmQyP2u9HgfZxpMzzlvJkQ,R J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"Oh my goodness, order the animal fries! They were AMAZING. My husband was crazy about the chickenburger, especially because of the honey chipotle sauce. I got the Frito pie, which was way too large....it was an entire 370 gram bag of Fritos, but since the toppings were only on top, I threw most of the Fritos away as opposed to taking home just plain chips. The chicken burger with the animal fries upgrade was $25, which I thought was very steep and explains the 4 stars as opposed to 5. That said, the food was fantastic and I love that the whole menu is plant-based. Nice drink selection and friendly service, too."
/user_details?userid=cKm-kSEvPro2qR7SauPR5Q,Amanda J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super fun plant based pub: laidback yet chic decor, great service and delicious, well presented food. Prices are rather steep (16-20$ for a burger), however, dishes are unique and too savoury to pass up. I recommend the ANML Fries, Popcorn Chkn and the Main Hotdog. PS for all folks who aren't necessarily fond of vegan food: I promise you won't be able to tell the difference!"
