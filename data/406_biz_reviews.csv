We ordered takeout for our friday evening and picked it up in the little shop. The food was great : a nice blend of spiciness, sweetness and sourness with rich flavors that transports you to Thailand with every mouthful. We were pleasantly surprised by the vegan curry with jackfruit, it was very tasty and not too overly sweet. If you like peanuts, the Massaman curry is your dish to conquer. The pad thai was excellent. However, if you don't eat spicy, I suggest you ask them ""no spice"" since they DO NOT mess around : it is legitimately spicy (it will make you sweat). Overall a great discovery and will come to back to try their bbq chicken and char siu pork ribs!"

Today's Thai food is its own with unique blends of the 5 tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and spicy.And then you have Chef owner Shawn Dascal, obsessed with food since he was young cooking meals with his grandma, graduated from the Cordon Bleu culinary school, travelled throughout Europe and Asia to hone his craft.Driven by his passion to create unforgettable meals, he pools from memories while he was training as an amateur Muay Thai fighter in Thailand, where he learned and developed a deep appreciation for the native flavours and cooking techniques passed down by the local ""Aunties"" as well as knowledge acquired in each of the four regions... and blends in his heritage to a type of cooking that grounds him and gives him balance, and now shares this with us!While walking in the NDG neighbourhood, upon recommendation from a fellow foodie friend, I stopped by and was so glad to be reconnected with the Chef and creator of Montreal's famous Moonshine BBQ, and without hesitation ordered a sampling of the menu including: Perfectly charred yet juicy Thai BBQ chicken, Fall off the bone Char Siu Pork Ribs, Tasty Dumplings, Spicy Shredded Papaya salad and let's not to forget Lime & Chili, Chili Pineapple and Scallion & Galanga sauces that brightens up all the flavours. Can't wait to try other items on the menu including the noodle dishes!"
