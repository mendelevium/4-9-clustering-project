It's dimly lit with a long bar and several high top seating areas. The sushi is always great, I order the snake roll and rainbow roll frequently. When Kyo is open for dining in, the outdoor seating is fantastic on Place Dame with a great view of the Basilica Norte Dame. The service is always top notch, it doesn't matter if you are grabbing a roll to go or spending some serious cash, they treat you like family. The wine list has plenty of reasonable options, even by the glass. I think the main reason to visit Kyo is the quality of the food. Take out or dining in, it's always been an excellent experience for me!"
/user_details?userid=fjFYpwpvlIlqoiNa3myDEA,Eugene G.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"I've walked by this place hundreds of times, either not noticing it, or dismissing it as a tourist trap (given the area, and all) - this was a mistake on my part, as the restaurant offers a rather enjoyable atmosphere, reminiscent of a real izakaya in Japan, with fresh, great tasting food.Will definitely repeat, as I'd like to try other items on the menu."
/user_details?userid=GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I somehow scored a free trip to Montreal with the Catholic club at my school. I will not disclose more than that. We decided to eat dinner here.I find it fascinating that in this Japanese restaurant, I did not manage to see any restaurant employee that appeared to be of Japanese/Asian descent. That's what these expensive fusion Asian restaurants are like, I suppose.I will say that the food was delicious. We ordered several items to share. I liked their sushi offerings. I'm a meat lover so we got chicken skewers and fried chicken. And bibimbap because of course.Our friend has a sesame allergy but the sushi section thankfully doesn't have any sesame! We also ordered vegetarian options for our plant-based friends. That was well-accommodated by our servers, with a meat-free version of the yaki udon."
/user_details?userid=gsZlJJ9gOjGi0kDIxYlBag,Ellen L.,"Arvada, CO",4 star rating,"A great place to go with friends if you like to share!The server warned us you'd want 2-3 plates per person and this was true. All the food was really great though, so sharing was not a problem. With 4 of us, we tried:Pork gyoza, shrimp/vegetable tempura, beef skewers, titake salmon, 2 rolls, and a 20 piece sashimi. The way everything comes out as it's ready is nice because you get to pace yourself and not have 6+ dishes in front of you at once. The atmosphere was nice and we made reservations so we had no issues getting a table even though we arrived a little early. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had in my life, that's a tough standard to meet, but it was definitely solid and the whole experience was nice. The prices weren't outrageous either, but it's not an inexpensive place. In USD we felt like we got a good deal. Paying between $60-$80 usd per couple, depending on how much you drink (pre-tip)."

/user_details?userid=9UN7xOF6uc1tlZrSRgZZ3A,Samantha M.,"Phoenix, AZ",4 star rating,"This sushi place is Japanese style tapas. It's a little pricey, but the waiter was super great at explaining the menu, and when we got the food, it seemed worth the price because it tasted so fresh. If you want a certain role, this isn't the best place to go as it is kinda limited. But if you have a date or small group that wants options, this is a great place for that. We got the chef's choice for nigiri and sushi, and it was all very good. Also the options for sake is so extensive, we just let the waiter choose for us. Overall, a great place. We would come back a couple times.l a year. The music and chat is a little loud so be prepared to shout a tiny bit."
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We gave the restaurant a 3/5 for various issues that occurred during our evening. The menu offers a tasting menu and when we ask to change two items on the menu, they refused. They were not very flexible, but most restaurants are. We got our miso soup served with dirty spoons and the actual bamboo bowl was cracked. You can imagine my soup leaking on the table. The wait were prompt to give us new spoons and bowls. The sushi were good and the okonomyaki was delicious. The wine list is abundant in choice. The wait was really great and never fussed about our complaints. However, nobody apologized about the issues at the beginning of the meal and never offered us anything on the house. We have saki bombs which they charged. Thought it was missing a little more professionalism from the managers side to at least come and see us since we spent a lots of money. We will not be back unfortunately"
/user_details?userid=LfVN5rI3rBTCaWM7OG_ohQ,Charlotte Q.,"Stroudsburg, PA",5 star rating,We ordered spicy salmon roll and eel roll.Each piece is huge. Rice is well cooked at the right amount of softness. Fish is fresh and really delicious.
/user_details?userid=49v8lBcU0k4rzDfUbnDQzg,Liliane B.,"Anjou, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I loved my experience at Kyo! I went to the restaurant for my friend's birthday. We got the tasting menu, which was 55$ and includes about 8 course. It is really worth it if you want to try a lot of the food for a good price! Everything was delicious, except I didn't understand why a salad would be in the tasting menu... It tasted okay, but it was just some greens, seaweed and cherry tomatoes. I would have been nicer if we got something else instead of that.The only reason I'm not putting 5 stars is that it took forever before they got rid of our salad and changed our course, especially since the other tables had their plates much faster."
/user_details?userid=tjFK8kxayHNoDxnICXHfdg,Sam M.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"We came here at a bad time. But we are sure glad we did.   The place was busy, with a long communal table taken up by a big party. My friend ordered sushi, which I can't eat. The two dishes I ordered were Grilled Eggplant w Crispy Brussels Sprouts Leaves and Seafood Okonomiyaki 'Crepe.'  So good I want the recipes for both. I would have given this place 5 stars, but we had to wait 30 minutes for our first dish. It just felt too long. Also, the two people sitting next to us got a lot of attention by multiple staff members.  I think everyone should be treated equally. Also, it was just so loud. The big group was loud.  I felt that we were in a frat party with their yelling. In the end, I would put up with the wait and noise for this kind of food."
/user_details?userid=IKonL7m2wENSMfibWx2DxA,Medya B.,"Huron Heights, London, Canada",1 star rating,"Went for dinner one evening, food was tasty but very expensive for the experience. I didn't find waiters professional as they were not taking necessary precautions during COVID. One waitress would serve food between my friend and I instead of from the side of the table - there was plenty room as the other waiters did this. If I didn't slide or move my head they would've been to close for my taste or would touch my head. They also forgot to serve us the rest of our course while serving everyone else. They gave us extra dessert but didn't actually apologize. Wouldn't go back."

/user_details?userid=P5f5Dx3_rL0znuE4wy77xQ,Sourabh M.,"Mississauga, Canada",1 star rating,"We are from Toronti where you get a complete range of authentic world cuisine. Being sushi and Japanese food lovers, we tried this place last night. We were not impressed by the quality of food, taste of preparations was average, and the prices were HIGH vs what we recieved as an experience. Dont get me wrong, I am all for paying high for the Roght quality taste and experience. We ordered the Sashimi platter, snake roll, avocado cucumber sushi, the bibimbap bowl, miso soup. Meat didn't seem fresh and was very little compared to a good sushi place. The bibimbap bowl had more rice than the real stuff. Miso soup had high levels of salt. I think the place is more for people newer to Japanese cuisine. Positives- service was super fast for all the dishes. But I am not returning customer."
/user_details?userid=qRsY0gIN0NFIcHDxAQTMYQ,Dara S.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",1 star rating,"Terrible service, don't waste your money.I went here in July 2019 with a couple girl friends. The waiter told us that the style there was that everyone at the table shares their bowls, so they don't come out all at once. We let him know that we wouldn't' be sharing, but if that's the way they will bring it out, it's fine.We asked if we could have lemons for our water. He said OK When he came back to take our orders, we asked again, if we could have lemons with our water. He said OK. When he came back with our appetizers, still no lemons, we asked again. He said OK. Then they brought out the rice bowls for my 2 friends, but not mine. I figured since they don't bring everything out at once, that mine would be coming soon. I told my friends not to wait for me, and that they could go ahead and eat. Still no lemons for the water btw.My friends finished eating their bowls and when he came back he asked if we wanted anything else. I asked him what happened to my food? He asked, ""They never brought it out?"" I think that should have been quite obvious since there was nothing in front of me except for lemonless water....He went to the back, then came back and said ""Oh the manager said the order was never put in. Well, do you still want it?"" I said, ""No, forget it"" He said a quick sorry, and I was shocked that the server wasn't more apologetic for forgetting my entire meal... He had the attitude of, ""Oh well, it happens.""I was even more shocked that he still charged me for the dumplings (they were only $10... couldn't they have covered it as a courtesy??) Most restaurants I've been to will take care of the bill, especially if it's small, if a big inconvenience such as that, happened on their behalf.I can say the dumplings were good, but I don't know about anything else because I never received my food.Also, never got the lemons. But I had given up on that a while ago.So, I would NOT reccommend."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This was my second time at the restaurant. I enjoyed the food more the first time but not enough to want to come back. This time my aunt wanted to take me out to dinner and she suggested this restaurant so I obliged. My aunt had a Singha beer and I had the Like a Caesar cocktail. It was a Caesar with Ketel one vodka ,Clamato, sriracha and ponzu sauce. What was cool about this cocktail was that they put a tiny bottle of sake was placed upside in the glass so as I drank more sake would come out. It was good! We started with the vegetarian gyoza. The pork was not available that night. The dumplings were so hard and crunchy because it was deep fried. It wasn't bad but I was expecting it to be pan fried like it is in most restaurants. It's my fault because it said fried on the menu but because the pork and chicken gyozas are pan fried I just assumed the vegetarian one would be too and didn't pay attention to the menu. We then had the kakuni pork (slow cooked pork belly). I love pork belly but this one was on the chewy side. The fat was good but the meaty part was a bit dry. The pieces were huge though. The shrimp ebi mayo was good and had a hint of wasabi. The takoyaki (fried octopus balls) were also good but with the fried dumplings it was too much deep fried food for us. Lastly we had the temptation (soy paper, honey mayo, tempura shrimp, avocado and tobiko) and the  kimono (tuna, salmon, asparagus, tempura and unagi sauce) sushi rolls. I've had better sushi elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend it. We were full and had a good time. I find this restaurant is pricey for what it is. There's better Japanese food elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible food but I wouldn't recommend it."

We live in Austin, Texas so the weather was a bit of an adjustment. Luckily there are things like delicious food and wine to warm up your blood when the temperatures are oh so depressing. We found Kyo online and were delighted to walk in and get seated right away for dinner. The shareable plates were delicious - we got sushi, udon noodles, a bimbimbap rice dish, pork belly and of course, drinks. Everything was top notch and Phil, our server, even laughed at my dumb jokes and made great wine recommendations. Highly recommend if you're in the area! I bet you never thought I'd get around to writing this review, Phil."

The price I paid for the size is not worth unfortunately. It's very good environment. If you want to get full, you have to spend close to 80$ per person. The size of their Bibimbap is close to the bowl size of a soup you get in chinese restaurant. Overall I give 2 stars just for the environment."

I've been wanting to come here for a while, but the main reason why I haven't gone before this event is due to the price.Due to being in the Old Port, I find this place to be more expensive than your average sushi restaurant. The tapas style appetizers and dishes, although really tasty, are pretty expensive considering their size. It is the same for the cocktails, some costing almost 20$. That being said, I really liked the beef tartare and the pork dumplings. Hospitality wise, the staff were very nice and the service was impeccable. We didn't need to wait a long time to get our drinks and our dishes were timed perfectly despite the fact that the restaurant was packed."

The pork belly was very flavorful, and the drinks were good. As I mentioned the portion size is tapas style so at $12-$15 a small plate does add up. I would come here for drinks as the atmosphere is nice, and maybe a small plate but not for dinner. It was very pricey for what it was.Server Camille was so nice! I asked her for a recommendation for a cafe and she wrote down some of her favorite cafes. Thank you Camille!"

They have sushi option, but don't come here thinking it's a specialize sushi restaurant. Kyo focuses on small Japanese tapas style food. Everything on the menu is very good, including the desserts. The location is also very hip. Nevertheless, Kyo is lacking in service as their inexperienced waiting does not meet expectations."

We came for the sushi and ordered the Chefs choice nigiri as well as some rolls. I really enjoyed the different types of fish that came with the Chefs choice. It is definitely not what I usually order but was a nice change. The options for sushi seemed like less than usual, but I think it's just the way they do things. The menu is really meant to be shared. Also liked the Suika pop drink. Ice popsicle in prosecco, yes please!-- but a bit pricey at $18. Is this NYC? I would probably come back, my friend wasn't as into it as I was though."
/user_details?userid=W_CkghBYSgJIJYi44GBTPA,HanDan W.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I ordered 10 pc of sashimi for 23$. It was ok overall.Definitely not as good as the ones I tasted in Japan. The waiter was also pretty slow to take the bill and fill out empty water cups. My friend ordered the table d'hôte with salmon. It was ok but the portion was small. We ended up going to Chinatown after dinner to grab some snacks. We felt Kyo is not up to my expectations to match its price. I prefer Nozy if I wanna some good quality sashimi. Probably won't come back for a second time.

Sashimi super fresh and our server did an excellent job of explaining the menu and specials. It did take an unusually long time to get our sashimi to the table but it was worth the wait. Drinks- fantastic drinks and well stocked bar. Truly some of the best sushi I've eaten!

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"Kyo is a cute little Japanese tapas style restaurant right in the heart of the old port of montreal. The decor inside is elegant yet comfortable but very tight in terms of space , it begins to feel very cramped when it fills up. We had a reservation and were seated immediately even though we got there early which was nice. Overall service was friendly but was very slow (I think it may have been the Kitchen that was backed up since our server was very attentive with checking in on us and apologizing for the wait). We ordered the tasting menu which was a 9course meal and while you do get a bit of everything the quantity was a little disappointing for the cost. The food itself was pretty good but some items were not as impressive as others. The sushi , gyoza dumplings , the doughnuts and the tuna tataki was very good but the chicken wings were very oily and the blackened cod was disappointing (the skin was not crispy and the cod as a little slimy and very little flavour). We had the tasting menu and a cocktail each and it bill was very high considering the quantity and in some items the quality. This wasn't a bad experience but it was definitely missing the mark in some areas."
/user_details?userid=PPt9-7v3IcseChyw_RpTQQ,Delphi L.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Fellow Yelpers, believe the hype, Japanese food is not at its best at Kyo (which in English means today). Not only the food was a meh, the staff was also inattentive- I had to stop a waiter for water after sitting down for quite some time.Opted for the bibimbap with marinated hamachi fish, egg and kimchi (the menu read ""vegetables""). It came only tepid. I wouldn't mind if there's not a raw yolk in the center.. Haru sushi, a combination roll of tuna, salmon, albacore, kanikama (imitation crab stick), tobiko, rolled with cucumber, was flooded in sauce. But hey in the restaurant's justice, who cares whether the sashimi was fishy and the sauce was way salty after wolfing down much alcohol. It's a bar after all. The service was very slow - considering the bar was only half full, can you imagine waiting 20 plus mins for your one starter and 55 mins for your entree? And the waitress (aka. bartender) was very impatient when I asked her to check on my entree and that showed on her face. Viola... Another 20 minutes flipped by after she told me that my dish ""was on the way."" haha, I blamed myself for not trusting more the previous Yelp ranking. :("

/user_details?userid=odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q,Don W.,"Biddeford, ME",4 star rating,"We had a nice meal at Kyo.  All of the food was tasty, though I might avoid the incredibly chewy beef tongue next time.  The good certainly outweighed the bad, but it's worth describing the entire experience.  The first bad thing would be the chairs.  My chair was filthy and they replaced it with a stained chair.  Seriously, someone turn on the lights and look at the chairs.But once we got past that, things improved.  The wine selection is expensive, we got one that I'd never tried before and while neither of us loved it, it wasn't bad.  Next time I might stick with something I knew better.  The food is basically tapas so we tried different things.  The beef tongue was chewy but the taste was nice.  The pork belly was really good.  The portions of omakase sashimi were small but the fish was very fresh.  The rainbow roll was nice but there was a sauce inside that was better off hidden behind wasabi & soy.  The gyoza were very good, as were the tempura.  And the negihama roll was exactly what I expected but it was small.  We had a good filling meal that improved as the night went on and for the two of us it was $150 plus tip.Service was terrific.  Our server Guillaume successfully managed to be both professional and warm at the same time, and I'm glad he was our server.For me, Kyo tries a little too hard to be hip and trendy but it's probably something that works well for them.  And let's face it, the young who seem to gravitate toward the kind of music played there and the dim lighting probably spend more money in restaurants than I do.  But the bottom line is that we left with full stomachs and big smiles.  I'd go back, I'd go when I could sit by a window before dark to have a little more light, and I'd look at those chairs before I sat in one!"

The server kept us almost 15 mins to take our drink order, but served a bottled wine to the table that came in to the restaurant after we did.When we were ordering food and drink, he didn't even look at us, said ""yeah"" and left. He didn't say a word of ""thank you"" to us. His attitude was so rude.The sashimi plater (which the food runner didn't explain which was what) included the worst part of tuna, which should have been removed. I was never served such tough stringy tuna in Toronto.The busser took away our salad bowl while we were still working on WITHOUT asking!! If there are some food left, they should ask first!! And no apologies.The server never came to our table for quality check. Never. Our table not worth to check??The server was very nice to other tables but not to us.

The rolls were mostly mediocre and the rice was not skillfully done as we have seen in other sushi restaurants."
/user_details?userid=k0QpEqseu2y87KIHyGVlzw,Eric B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal, and certainly my favourite sushi restaurant (I've been here 4-5 times). It's in a quaint corner spot in Old Montreal, and service is always friendly, fast, and helpful. The sushi is of the modern style, so don't expect much in the way of classics (although they do that the standard california roll, spicy tuna, etc.). They also have interesting choices like the Snake (not made with real snake), and the beef sashimi (made with real raw beef). They also have an outstanding choice of sake, and a sake tasting menu as well. Great food, great service, great place!"
/user_details?userid=cOVZqooHANlKBmD3fLvGQg,Sandra D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Before we were seated, I was thinking about how I'd have to dock stars from their rating due to our experience. We got there at 9PM on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we were kind of asking for it - but, the hostess & manager were not exactly attentive (or kind) we had to remind them 3 times that we were a group of 3 and no one approached us yet. Finally, after 25 minutes of standing by the door, the manager said there'd be a 45 minute wait for us to even sit at the bar. Luckily, there was a bar upstairs so we killed some time there. However, we still weren't sat until about 11PM...so much for 45 minutes, right? Aaaaanyway...the experience flipped around once we were finally seated. Our waiter Patrick was awesome. He took our order immediately and our drinks came shortly after. The food took a while, so Patrick came by with cherry sake bombs as a token of appreciation for our patience. They were really fun to do & tasted delicious! Thank you Patrick! We ordered the beef tartare as an appetizer and it was mouthwatering. The sushi and sashimi was also to die for; it may be among the top 3 sushi places I've ever been to. The night ended with Patrick giving us a list of local bar/club recommendations since he knew we were tourists. :) TL/DR: don't come without a reservation if you don't want to wait forever. Food is amazing."

The food was delicious - we were served beef sashimi, edamame, chicken wings, wasabi mayo jumbo shrimp, pork dumplings, salad with seaweed, black cod, sushi with salmon and tuna (and asparagus), and yuzu beignets (as well as the uni nigeri).

Our server Meghan was incredible and made the experience five stars. The only disappointment was chef's maki choice. We felt that in comparison to other sushi items on the menu, the chef's choices were a bit too bland and not as unique. However, overall, we still felt this was a five star experience."

There was live music and dj was spinning great music tbh. The staff were very friendly, perticularly the bartender.

I ordered a Suzuki Sling and my waitress showed me the proper way to serve the drink (a mix it your self hot sake drink.) She was so nice and was totally okay with getting USD tips (all we had in cash) The sashimi plate (10 pieces) was said to also be very good. Bathrooms were clean and being downstairs was nice to get away from all the noise for a moment.Sushi bar was pleasant (the place gets really packed, get a reservation just in case, we lucked out this time) the place is a bit small and has outdoor seating, the small space is fine when your sitting down but trying to leave is a puzzle. Took a bit to get our check but like I said, the place was packed to capacity and then some.

However, while nearly 5-6 people in the restaurant, they seated us (3 people) all the way at the back of restaurant by the kitchen. My seat was at the pathway of where wait staffs were in & out of kitchen. Very uncomfortable and feel like someone will throw something on me. We ordered the sake tasting for 2. Since I'm a long-time Sake Lover, I know what types of sake I don't like. Thus, I asked the waiter not to give us certain types of sake, but he refused immediately, which I thought it was kind of rude."

The foods they serve is sushi but it's not that nice compare to other Japanese restaurants in mtl. One time the smell is sashimi was too strong (not good fish). But then it's hard to find good Japanese restaurants in mtl so this place is not that bad. Their hot plates are typical dishes served in most of all Japanese restaurants. One bad experience I have every single time is... the drink I order is always out of stock.. so I always pick two drinks as my back up. Overall, I give 5 bc no waiting time, not too expensive and still get to eat Japanese food."

They have several cocktails. I didn't like the Bruce Li but did like my friend's drink with cranberry and wine. The sushi was really good. So fresh tasting. I liked how they used cucumber instead of rice to hold it together. We ended up splitting a bread pudding with a matcha sauce for dessert. So good. Our waiter was nice. Service was a bit slow but it was crowded in there. A little hard to hear due to all the noise from other diners and the music blaring. Prices were in line with most restaurants in the area.

A couple outdoor heaters and it would have been perfect. Wait staff was very nice and gave great recommendations but not the fastest service. The waiter mentioned something about not expecting so many people to sit on the terrace so maybe they were just understaffed that night. The sushi was really fresh and delicious but a bit on the pricey side for what you get. I probably wouldn't come here for a big sushi night, because the selection is small. We had the donuts for dessert. I didn't expect to love them as much as I did! The donuts were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and the Japanese dipping sauce was  not overly sweet and had a lemony touch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.

It's become our restaurant of choice when we have something to celebrate. The ambiance is inviting - modern, cozy and low lit. Japanese food happens to be my favourite type of cuisine and this place does not disappoint. We always order the Grilled black cod marinated in white miso and sake every time we go. It's perfectly crispy on the outside and the white fish is soft and buttery inside. I would avoid the oysters. I think they are fresh but they are served with some bubbly sauce on top and I did not like that. The sushi makis are very fresh and inspired. If you want vegetarian makis it's not on the menu but the chef will make something special for you upon request. This place is popular. The last time we went they were fully booked so we sat at the bar and realized it's a great spot to be if you're two.

I would highly suggest picking a cocktail to compliment your sushi order. The cocktails were priced $10-16CAN which, for a traveling American, was a great price for such a quality cocktail. The sushi itself was also well priced and we all left extremely happy!

The sushi rice was sweeter then what I would prefer. The sushi rolls were also just Ok. I really enjoyed the yuzu donuts desert. Most of everything I liked the sake tasting flight that consists of four different types of sake, nicely presented and explained by our host (wish I could remember the details).I would definitely return to Kyo for a drink or two, as the name suggests this is a Japanese bar that has nice food for snack with your cocktail."

When the waitress suggested this I was like ""what the hell?""  Never heard of strawberry in a roll before. However I decided to give it a try. I was glad I did, every bite was an explosion of flavor. One minute I felt the crunch of the radish, then the softness of the crab, then all the sudden you bite into the lychee and you get a splash of juice. It was quite an experience. The waitress was also very sweet and thoughtful. She gave suggestions on places to see and go. Also talked for a bit about the food culture in Montreal.

The sesame dressing was good.The tonkatsu was oily, to the point where I couldn't finish it and that was despite being starving and wanting tonkatsu really badly.They didn't give me any rice and the ""Japanese coleslaw"" listed on the menu was two slices of pickled daikon with a tiny mound of grated cabbage.I've had better tonkatsu in a convenience store.(In Tokyo, yes, but still.)I didn't try any sushi, but based on this experience, I'm not going to go back unless it's for a drink."

The doughnut was so good! I don't know what they call it, but I tried these chicken pieces on a skewer. They were glazed with a tasty sauce and topped with sesame seeds = AMAZZZING. I then tried sushi with crab inside and a sweet slice of strawberry-love on top. It too was heavenly. I intend to go back soon with my Fiance who no doubt will love it. The decor is truly Japanese and it a lovely restaurant. Very romantic, not too big, but also not too small. I can't wait to go back!!!"

I loved everything we tried, even the dishes we ordered that I was initially on the fence about but tried on a whim. The Kyo maki roll for example, which has strawberry and lychee along with crab and tuna, turned out to be my absolute favorite. We almost ordered another despite being stuffed. Finished off the night with fresh donuts paired with yuzu sauce. I would go back just for that roll and that dessert!"

We also ordered three maki rolls: Califonia, Kamikaze, and Kyo.Highlights of the meal were the maki rolls and the chicken wings.  The Kyo roll was especially interesting - it included lychee and strawberry - neither of which I had never had in a roll before. The flavors worked well though, with the strawberry providing a sweet taste and the lychee giving it a unique texture.  The nagoya chicken wings were also delicious - tender meat covered in a tasty sweet sauce. I would definitely recommend both dishes.Unfortunately, some dishes were disappointing.  The gyoza dumplings were nothing special and the agedashi tofu was rather bland - neither the tofu cube or the hot tenstuyu broth offered much flavor.All in all though, the meal was enjoyable and the restaurant/service were great.  I would recommend Kyo if you are in Montreal and looking for a good sushi experience."

We had friendly service, though the service was a little slow in my opinion, compared to the number of customers in the restaurant (about 1/4 full), but there was only one waitress that was taking all the orders, checking up on the customers, and serving the food, so it was understandable.

She had quite an attitude and told us that we were not allowed to talk to the sushi chef which is a bit weird when you are sitting at the sushi bar.  She also took our menus after we placed our initial order even though we told her that we would be ordering more and then gave us a huge sigh and huffed off to get the menu again when we told her we wanted to order more, but needed to look at the menu again.  Sorry...we didn't study and memorize it for your convenience.  Geeze.  And even though we were dining early and the restaurant was not very busy, she was more interested in talking to her co-worker than in coming by to check to see if we needed anything.  The sushi chef ended up striking up a convo with us and even though he had very broken English, he was a delightful person and made us feel at home.   Had it not been for him and his assistant, who made every plate we were served a beautiful piece of art, the overall stars would have been even lower.So, to sum up:Food - solid 4 starsService (with the exception of the sushi chef and his asst) - 1 star, maybe"

Made reservations via open table a week in advance as it was Igloo festival and Happening Gourmand weekend. I added a comment it was my birthday. Upon arrival my reservations were not in the system. I showed the gentleman at the front my email confirmation on my smartphone. He said it was no problem and he would find us a seat. We were seated at the round table by the window which seats 4 so it was spacious but a bit cold. The man came back to the table and said he found my reservation in the system. Overall the food for me was average. The menu is limited to a few dishes only, for $25 no alcohol.  My dishes were the sunomono salad to start ( Harusame noodles, cucumber, coriander, wakame, kani crab). I liked it as it was light with flavor. I tried the spicy salmon maki but found it lacked being spicey. My main dish was the chicken yaki (mirin marinated chicken thigh with rice). I was not impressed with it as it lacked flavor and was not very warm as it was served. I enjoy sauce with my chicken and it was missing from this dish. I had the pinky ginger cocktail which was an extra $11. It was tasty with ginger, lychee and raspberry purée. I finished with dessert the Yuzu donuts with condensed milk and black sesame. Good portion size as it comes with 3 donuts. I took mine off the chopstick and soaked it in the milk.This was my 2nd visit here, it was more memorable the last time. The service was average nothing over the top. There was different waitresses coming to the table. The ambiance and decor is good, the music was good as they played R&B from the 90s. My boyfriend said it was way too loud for his taste. For my birthday there was no extra dessert brought out, perhaps we had to mention it."

I don't think it is supposed to taste sour. I don't think it is right. The reason for reasonable stars is that they did offer to replace with another dish.

The atmosphere is nice, the service is great, and if you want sushi that is ""OK"" by Toronto / Vancouver standards, and are OK with paying $19 for some chirashi, then this is a good place to come. to eat.Personally, I think the quality is on par with those cheap sushi shops.

The salad was very small and only have very few sashimi in it, totally overpriced. The maki is ok. But just ok and no more. The yaki udon is a big disaster! Too salty and sour even cannot find any sashimi in it maybe they are tooooo small for me to find? We waited for an hour for 2 yaki udons at 8 pm which means not too much people in the restaurant so I cannot figure out why it takes too long to make 2 noodles. To sum up.

The chicken was juicy, tender, and beautifully marked by the grill. For dessert we had a soft cake with matcha powder on top, berries on the side with a cheesecake type sauce. The combo was lovely.

The agadeshi tofu was okay but it came with a sauce that was ridiculously salty.Thankfully the main meal was much better than the appetizers. The chirashizushy was  interesting, it was like eating a huge bowl of sushis. Although the mix of  rice, sashimi and veggies was good at first I got tired of it towards the middle and couldn't finish it. I think it would have been better as an appetizer. For the desert, we had the yuzu donuts with  condensed milk. My donuts were cold which kind of spoiled the desert to me. I really liked the taste of yuzu though.

There was upbeat music (from my middle/high school years), and we were seated in front of the bar which was a great view. I liked the lighting, the furniture etc. But then when it came to ordering food, the service was really slow and inconsistent. My 3 friends got their soy glazed maple chicken appetizer but the rest of us had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our appetizer, which was tataki. I thought that was not well planned, giving some our friends food while the rest of us had to wait. It's just not a good ""flow"" of service I guess. Same with the dessert. I got my dessert first and then the rest had to wait for their yuzu donuts.I have to say the main dish was mediocre, but the appetizers and dessert were pretty solid, The chicken wings, man, delicious! The salmon tataki was yummy and juicy as well. But the main dish, hmm...nothing special? The dessert was a wow! I had chocolate green tea bread pudding...it was something I never tasted before in my life. The waiter drizzled green tea sauce all over it. I wish I could have finished it, but alas I was so full I gave it to my boyfriend to finish. It kind of looked like salad from afar, but it's a very unique dessert I have to say. I give this place 3 stars because the service was not consistent in terms of pacing and also the main dish was not up to par with the appetizers and dessert.

Hamachi dol sot bi bim bap - A Korean influenced dish. A screaming hot stone bowl filled with seasoned rice, shimieji mushrooms, homemade kim chi, cucumber, slices of yellowtail tuna and topped with a raw egg yolk.Served with a side of sweet and spicy sauce, we were instructed to pour it over top and mix up the bowl; the umami was off the charts. The sweetness from the sauce, tartness from the kimchi, savoriness from the mushrooms, bitterness from the charred rice on the inside of the bowl was all brought together by the broken yolk that made each bite creamy and delicious.

Attached to Hotel Place d'Armes and fantastic sushi and izakaya cuisine. Our server Vivienne was phenomenal and we tried the Kyo roll which was to die for. Location, food, service- I thought  5 stars all around. The donuts also don't disappoint!"

/user_details?userid=gxYdU7-z-g804OfjMlStBw,Mark S.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"I'd pass.  This is a restaurant confused about its identity.  There is no confusion, however, about its food - not very good.Food first.  We ordered the agedashi tofu, the grilled beef tongue, a rainbow maki and salmon sashimi.  We also tried to order the grilled beef tenderloin.  However, on a Saturday night at 9, they had already run out.  How do you run out of an izakaya staple like that on Saturday night?!?  That should've been a hint right there.The agedashi tofu had a nice warm exterior with a hint of a crunch.  Good so far.  However, the inside was still ice cold.  Fine, not everyone makes their own fresh tofu, and Kyo certainly doesn't aspire to that level of Japanese authenticity, but, at the very least, let your tofu rest to room temperature fully.  All four portions were like this.  And that is not how it should be.The beef tongue should have a sear on it.  It's a very quick cook.  Instead, it was more like a braised tongue.  No sear.  A grey soggy mess.  More like a braise or a boiled tongue...No complaints about the salmon sashimi, but one of the fishes in the rainbow roll had a slight off taste to it.  My own fault for ordering sushi at an izakaya...Kyo is in an upscale boutique hotel.  All the guests were very nicely dressed.  Upscale, adult venue one would think.  So, I was a bit surprised and un-nerved when the waitresses started shouting sake bomb verses at the top of their lungs.  Ummmm, not very classy.  This behavior makes sense and belongs at Imadake and even Kinka near Concordia.  Here, not so much.  You've got a high price point, well dressed clientele and you want your waitresses to be acting like they're at a frat party???  Oh, and the waitstaff is slow, too.  It took 15 minutes before the waitress came back to take our dinner order.  And at the end, 10 minutes before we got our check, after flagging the waitress back.The only good thing about Kyo was the aforementioned well-heeled guests.  A plethora of eye candy.  Of course, the girl chose this spot.  Unfortunately, with the girl, I couldn't ogle the other beautiful guests as much as I would've liked.  Oh well.  =)Altogether a frustrating experience.  I'll just stick with Imadake (for a rowdy time) or Kinka (for a more measured tone) next time."

/user_details?userid=lKeg24z4c1GQwesR6x8qaA,Ashley B.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Kyo Bar is a very loud bar/drinks place. The drinks selection is extensive. It is a reasonable place to go for after work drinks with a corporate business partner but the sushi is very poor and the prices are quite high. You're better off going elsewhere.

Enjoyed the pork belly in lettuce wraps appetizer special, California rolls, chicken skewer, yaki udon with chicken and kimchi. The gaigin and kamikaze rolls were both very good as well. They were very accommodating to my son who only wanted avocado and cucumber rolls that aren't on their regular menu. Two thumbs up! Thanks Yelpers (and the Intercontinental concierge who confirmed for me) that this is the place to go for sushi while in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=HkXAHqvOEWB7vucFa4iQqw,Raam P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"If i had to describe my night hear in one word: Terrible.This was our night:1. Used opentable to reserve a table for 9pm - when we arrived the hostess informed us that they received out reservations but a table was not available and that we could have a drink at the bar to wait. FORTY minutes later they seat us.We sit down and order the fish and the calamari. The calamari was descent. It came to the table hot and the sauce was quite spicy/very good. The black cod arrives 25 minutes after we order it. We ask for a knife, the knife never arrives. Also, the fish was undercooked - it was seasoned well but definitely undercooked.At this point (about an hour and 15 minutes since we arrived and only 2 plates in) we ask for the bill and overhear the table behind us discussing how terrible the service/management is at this place. We bond over this point and eventually grab a drink with them. The bill comes we pay and leave.This is possibly one of the worst managed/worst izakaya/restaurants I have ever been to.I would never recommend this place to anyone."

The food was at about the same level your average neiborhoodSushi restaurant. Everything we ate was mostly just ok. One really good offering though was the fried skate wing ;quite crispy, lighly battered and succulent when dipped in ponzu. There were lots of interesting cocktails offered but  two we picked were like the food just ok.A big turn off was the service...too many people running orders from the sushi barand kitchen acting like waiters. We had at least five different people bring food out to the table and  then asking for additional orders.  They were all nice and well intentioned, but ,made the dining experience seem quite chaotic,Kyo has  a tempting desert menu and like eveything else it was just ok.So unless the've made some big changes in last few weeks I recommend that  you spend your more than 100 bucks per person elsewhere."

The restaurant had only been open a few days, but you wouldn't have known it. Rare indeed for a ""soft"" opening...The wait staff were awesome, especially Genevieve. She suggested we simply relax and order a chef's choice sampler, which consisted of assorted apps and entrees: Japanese noodle favorites, Asian shortribs, sauteed veggies, and some really awesome sushi, both rolls and sashimi. Who would have thought you could get great sushi in Montreal?? Oh yes, you canThe fish was extremely fresh, very flavorful, and had some nice chef-style touches added. I especially liked how they used tobiko and roe... yummyPrices are a bit high (blame us tourists) but the place is new, tastefully designed, and top notchGo here... vien ici!"

Don't be afraid to get creative when ordering, you won't regret it. Highly recommend the Hamachi Bibimbap!"

Good vibe, all around busy spot with good energy. The red wine was excellent, as was the unfiltered sake (they have a large sake selection). We didn't order too much sushi so I can't say much about how it compares - but what we did get was definitely fine (and reasonably priced). The music at a good volume without being too loud to talk, and the service was excellent. Very nice start for a night out in Old Montreal."

Unfortunately we encountered the worst service I've experienced in years AND the food was mediocre. We had made a reservation and were seated when we walked in however we then waited about 20 minutes before we had water or were acknowledged. We would have left but it was late and we were hungry. The waitress finally came to the table (which was strange as we didn't think it was her that would be serving us since she had probably passed by the table a dozen times) and took our drink and appetizer order. The cold sake we ordered was good but wasn't cold and it took quite a while for the waitress to finally come back with the ice bucket. Meanwhile she was at the table behind us drinking with those customers. The bad service continued, we rarely saw her. Had to ask to place our dinner order and for the appetizer to be cleared away after it had been sitting for a good 20-25 min (she had been walking past this whole time) and our menus were at our table the entire time we were there. The sushi was just OK, nothing I would recommend but maybe because it had been sitting waiting to make it to our table. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place when there are so many options in Montreal, we were there for hours and it was not worth it! The tables that were seated behind us seemed to face to same issues as we heard them complaining as well, not sure if it was because we all spoke English but as a tourist I would avoid!"

I really wished it was possible to give a zero star. Their spinach salad's sesame sauce was so thick and so greasy, their tempura was really greasy that I wanted to puke it out after two pieces, their chicken wings were soaked in soy sauce and super salty and their cocktail has no taste of alcohol what so ever. Everything there seem to have so much salt and grease it was almost like if a fast food chain did it. And all this at their high price? You can find way better and more authentic izakaya food anywhere else at that price."

/user_details?userid=xJYq-GW-A0dKB6n7XvZRzg,Fred S.,"Scarborough, Canada",2 star rating,"Had dinner here last night.  The atmosphere is nice but service is pretty bad.Ordered several sushi rolls, a side of kimchi, miso soup and edamame for starters.  The edamame took almost an hour to come out which is strange because you would think they have that just sitting in the back ready to go.  Then our rolls started coming out.  We inquired about the miso soup but were told that the regular chefs area was backed up while the sushi station was running on normal speed and that it would be out shortly.  This didn't make any sense because again, you would think they have miso soup sitting in the back ready to go.  Anyways we get everything except for the miso soup and a side of kimchi and the waiter brings us the bill with everything on it!  When we told him that we had never received the miso soup or the side of kimchi and he said he would bring it out right away since they have it sitting in the back ready to go.  Either our waitress who brought out our food lied to us or our waiter was lying to us.  Either way, we declined and asked them to just remove the items from our bill.  After waiting another 10 minutes for the new bill with no apology we paid and promptly left.  All in all, service was really slow and lacking.  We were there for about 2 hours and the restaurant wasn't exactly busy.  Sushi wasn't anything special....about the same as any other sushi place and it would have been much cheaper to have had dinner elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=pNwehfTAC2ZJlc93a28hwQ,jeff k.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"We had the mixed sashimi platter it was very good. But the salmon sashimi  la carte was amazing. $6 for three huge pieces of salmon slices was the best salmon I ever ate. My family all agreed. We don't get this quality salmon in NY(almost as good). If you ever tried Toro and compare it to Maguro, then you now what I'm talking about.The salmon here tastyed like Fatty tuna but as a salmon. You can actually see the fatty lines in the salmon that you normally don't see elsewhere.It melted in my mouth so we ended up ordering 7 more orders of this salmon. Is it this restaurant or is it the canadian salmon? I was told that canadian salmon was very good compared to the one from the states but I can't be sure.How can salmon taste so good, so fatty, so melt in your mouth good!!! I gave this restaurant 4 stars but the salmon put it over into stratosphere 5 stars. For a place designed as a Japanes style drinking joint, this place has great decor and modern ambiance. The food is surprisingly excellent. Salmon is a must eat item here."
