/user_details?userid=LGVSbsluzdxwbyiWUh2nAA,Marc F.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant is simply unbelievable. I'd say it's one of the best restaurants I've been to in Canada, definitely in Montreal. The quality of the food and taste is simply remarkable. The food pairings are unique and you are often left saying to your table ""wow this is all amazing!"". The lobster spaghetti is the staple to order for the table while the steaks and other meats are as delicious as they come. However we also ordered daily specials. The service is also top notch. They make great suggestions and simply seem to love what they do.What's great about this place is that you can go all out and spend a week's pay or dine for a very reasonable price based on what you choose. You need to make a reservation online well I advance, so don't expect to make a walk-in and get a table. Highly recommend this place and will return every time I can while in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=PSLjMXzukormEMVYkgI1ng,Timothy K.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Started strong but ended with a whimper. The appetizers, sides and wine were excellent and thoughtful but the mains were cold, bland and lacked the care and attention that was paid to the former. At the ~$400 price point we expected much better. Perhaps the popularity and notoriety of this establishment has ""gotten to the heads"" of several members of the staff which has resulted in a dip in quality, service and attention to detail.My girlfriend and I arrived at Liverpool House with lots of excitement and high expectations. A 9:15pm reservation, 10 days in advance was the best we could do at this extremely popular restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly manager and seated in a cold spot next to the front door but were quickly moved into the much warmer main dining room after we asked if there were other seats. They gave us a moment to enjoy the ambience before our friendly server took our cocktail orders and answered any questions we had about the menu.We started with a dozen oysters at market price (~$40) which were extremely fresh, well shucked (clean presentation, easy to separate from the shell with lots of ocean water) and delicious. We asked the server to recommend a bottle of white wine to pair with our seafood mains. The wine, a 2018 unfiltered white from France called Los Annegeles ($84), was fresh, zesty and ended with an almost nutty finish; a great wine. Our next dish was the tartare ($22) which was for us the clear standout. The beef was perfectly seasoned and fresh. The red endives added a welcome freshness and the shaved parmesan gave it an extra, balanced bite. Needless to say, after such a strong start we were very excited for the mains. I ordered the signature lobster spaghetti ($49) and my partner chose the halibut ($38). The halibut was cold. When we told the server, she offered to ""warm it up"" which is completely unacceptable considering the price of the dish and the risk of overcooking the fish by putting in the microwave (which is what I assumed she meant). My girlfriend had to smother the cold fish in the lukewarm broth to make it edible. It was a difficult position to be in because we were out on a nice evening and didn't want to make a scene. In this case, I would expect the server to see our displeasure (which was clear) and do everything she could to improve our experience. My pasta was shockingly overcooked and bland. The lobster was great. A $49 pasta dish should be flawless - al dente noodles and flavourful sauce. I didn't mention it to the server for fear of what she might say. We also ordered a tomato salad ($15) which was amazing and almost salvaged the poor mains. Perhaps the chefs on the main courses had an off night but it just felt lazy and pretty much ruined the evening and I doubt they tasted the food before sending it out. What was most surprising was the stark contrast in quality between the appetizers and the mains. I can only assume that there were different chefs preparing them and the team on the mains had a terrible performance, perhaps in dire need of a refresher. In sum, the strong start couldn't make up for the regrettable finish. 2 stars seems fair."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"I'm having a hard time figuring out if I want to give this place 3 or 4 stars. It would be nice to give 1/2 stars because I'd give it a 3.5, but I like to be generous so a 4 is where I'll land. We couldn't get into the restaurant next door called Joe Beef (apparently a RIDICULOUSLY popular restaurant) we found this place which had a very high Yelp rating, so here we are!Atmosphere/Appearance: This place engulfs you in a very modern, laid-back, elegant, mature aura as soon as you walk in. The ceiling is low, the lights are low and the spaces are cozy. There's a small bar area toward the back as you walk in. If you go to the right you enter into another dining room where there is a big chalkboard with all of their available wine bottles and prices. I didn't really like this. They don't have a wine or drink menu for you to look at. You just have to look at the damn board. Really? I have to stand up and squint at the board in this dim light over people trying to enjoy their meal? I wasn't a fan. Safe to say I didn't have any wine. Moving on...Service: Cecile rubbed all 3 of us (my 2 coworkers and I) the wrong way almost the entire dinner until I broke the ice damn-near toward the end. She seemed to have an attitude and it turned us off. We were very close to asking for a new server or the very nice guy that made room for 3 guys with no reservations. We toughed it out though and after business slowed down a but she seemed to ease up. Maybe she was just busy? Maybe she was overwhelmed? I don't know. Anyway, once she loosened up we were able to make decent conversation with her.Food: The menu is small, but the enables the chefs to really knock it out of the park for the dishes that are offered. The food is freaking phenomenal. This was my first time ever having quail and my goodness I was blown away for sure. It came as an appetizer paired with roasted seasonal vegetables. It was fantastic and I couldn't get enough. For my entree I went with the duck. It was prepared rare and was so tender, juicy and sweet.Value: Bring the big bucks. All prices listed are in $CAD. My double Hendrick's gin drinks were $24.50 each. The quail was $21.00 and the duck was $40.00. This place isn't cheap, but you're absolutely paying for quality here so it's kinda worth it. Don't come trying to be cheap.This place was pretty cool... but I think one time is enough for me... Give it a shot, but be open minded with an open wallet."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was extremely eager to have dinner at this highly rated restaurant and hearing all the hype... Unfortunately the hype was overrated, prices were high and didn't quite meet my expectations. I had the Brussels sprouts for appetizer which was really good and the signature lobster pasta which was extremely creamy, bland and not worth $45. If you do not eat bacon, make sure to ask them to not add any as they do not mention it in their menu. Nothing spectacular and glad I can cross it off my list. Based on my experience at Liverpool, not sure I would attempt Joe Beef."
/user_details?userid=g6lAGkVpCxP4UldT5FwgOw,Dickson Y.,"Milliken, Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Would definitely recommend the:1) lobster spaghetti - al dente texture, lots of butter paired with lobster and ham/jambon.  Best if shared with two people.     2) Foie gras breakfast sandwich - there's something about the buttery foie gras mixed with maple syrup that blends very well"
/user_details?userid=ckXoXMzQkNGtV4hjIX9LOA,Janeczka W.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Overhyped and underwhelming. I'm shocked that this place gets such great reviews. We went in early September. The food is OK, nothing to rave about. We spent around $400 for 2 people (plus a 20% tip) and as we were having out last glass of wine and dessert our waiter asked us if we could hurry up and leave so that they can bring in new guests. Very awkward. We ended up going to a lesser known spot in Mile End to meet friends later on. I wish we ate there. Don't believe the hype, Liverpool House is a tourist trap!"
/user_details?userid=fdOuKZghNqoaA-Z8kn7_qQ,Jamie Y.,"Irving, TX",5 star rating,"This was one of the restaurants that I wanted to eat at when I was visiting Montreal. It did not disappoint! I don't have many experiences in eating French cuisine, so I was not sure what to expect. The waiter was very friendly and enthusiastic about French food! He explained a lot about the menu and the specials they had. Also, he helped us choose the perfect wines for the dinner.Based on the lots of reviews, we had to try lobster spaghetti, and we also ordered flank steak. OMG. The food here is amazing! My husband was hesitant to order flank steak because it had bleu Elizabeth cheese as one of the ingredient (he is not a bleu cheese fan). The waiter assured him that he will like the dish, so he ordered the dish... and he was so happy that he listened to the waiter! The flank steak was cooked to perfection and every ingredient came together as one dish! And of course the lobster spaghetti was awesome. We ended our dinner with one of their special dessert - angel food cake soaked in strawberry syrup with chocolate chip ice cream. It was perfect way to end our first real French dinner.I would definitely recommend Liverpool house!! Make your reservation now!"
/user_details?userid=5xxI2JMKSyPNCLpXOgPaig,Chad V.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",5 star rating,"The food was amazing and the bartenders were talented and friendly. Sister restaurant Joe Beef was full so I ended up a couple doors down at Liverpool House and couldn't be happier with the result. The two dishes I had were extraordinary. First was a classic beef tartar, tender, well-seasoned topped with egg yolk and served with a fried puff cracker made from beef tendon. It involves some food alchemy but the result goes perfectly with the tartar. For my main was the best rabbit dish I've had in ages. Prepared two ways. Leg was likely wood fired and had a Smokey and sweet exterior. The ambiance is a little ramshackle tending toward homey though. Walls decorated with bric-a-brac and seemingly random tiles, wallpaper and wood wainscoting covering the walls. The decor doesn't matter with food this good. Just go and enjoy a superb culinary experience!"
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"**This is a 3.5 star review**This restaurant was good, but not as fantastic as I had expected based on the hype and the reviews. We ordered the lobster spaghetti and I thought it was too heavy, laden with too much cream and butter. Seriously, bring your stretchy pants if you order this dish. Portions are huge and this dish is very caloric.The fried Brussel sprouts were really tasty. My cocktail stole the show. The servers are very personable and friendly. I don't think the restaurant is that stellar, I was left. a bit disappointed."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've had the great pleasure of eating here at least half a dozen times over the past few years and thought it's about time that I pen a review. This, just in case being listed amongst Canada's top 100 restaurants is not enough incentive for you to decide to eat here.Just as we sit down on an early Saturday evening, the table next to us is served two portions of the famous lobster spaghetti. The smell of this dish is strong and unmistakable. The first image that pops in my head is some random seafood restaurant in Maine or Cape Cod. I can picture wooden flooring, lobster traps on the walls, and a view of the water. I'm thinking of warm dinner rolls with whipped butter and a menu that refers to side dishes as ""starches"". All that from the intensely fresh ocean smell of lobster and bacon/cognac cream sauce. A lot of places serve lobster and even more serve pasta. There are however only a select few that can combine these ingredients and build such a miracle on a plate. You can tell that the sauce for this dish is painstakingly developed with a homemade seafood stock. This dish is magic and is the reason you come to this restaurant. To start the meal, we ordered 6 oysters. The waitress brought us 7 including 3 separate varieties. Two of these have to be the largest and tastiest oysters I have ever sampled. Each one had a distinct flavour which I enjoy with a simple squirt of lemon. (In general, I find the mignonette, cocktail sauce, and horseradish mask the taste and ruins the experience. I could put cocktail sauce and horseradish on a piece of lettuce and it would taste the same.)We then had the halibut cheeks which were absolutely spectacular. They were served poached in a mild brown asian sauce. This dish tasted like the most elevated Chinese food I can imagine. It was well seasoned, melted in your mouth, and left us wanting a lot more. I could have eaten 10 of these appetizers without blinking.We also tried then endives casino which is basically a shelled clam casino dish served in a cooked endive. The endive added absolutely nothing to the dish and the taste of clams was overpowered by breadcrumbs and grease. Also, for 16$, they only served 2 endives which is poor value. That's fine. This is not a permanent dish on the menu and you can't bat 1000 all the time.Finally, for dessert we tried the lemon tart and the palmier ice cream sandwich. The lemon tart was standard and forgettable. The ice cream sandwich however, was layered with what appeared to be sautéed and reduced sweet blueberries. You can tell it had been assembled minutes before it was served. The ice cream was not too firm and each bite contained a piece of the cookie which was crunchy. Paired with some sweet port, this was the perfect way to end an epic meal.They deserve their ranking amongst the best restaurants in the country!"

What a delicious quebecois delight in the heart of Montreal. Sister restaurants are both just a couple doors down from each other. Food: for two we split the tartar and mozzarella for appetizers. Both were delicious, the mozzarella came with a beet spanakopita, which was not disclosed on the menu but delicious nonetheless! Tartar had a nice kick with the mustard. I would definitely recommend the tartar. I loved that it was made with tendon and the yolk was creamy. For my main I had the fresh pasta special. Oh boy, the beef was melt in your mouth delicious! My friend had the halibut, we are from the west coast so we love our seafood...this halibut was executed perfectly.Service: tentative and quick. As it should be because they don't have drink menus to encourage interaction. The wine list is on a chalk board, which is a bit odd if you aren't seated near it.Ambiance: cozy! Feels almost like you're in a rustic Quebec cabin. Canoe on the roof, little home style decor - loved it. Highly recommend to locals and travellers."

If anyone who decides on a road trip to Montreal and ask me for good guide. This place is definitely the top of my list. Amazing ambience, great food, and friendly staffs. Patio looks excellent in the Summer time as we have a glimpse to the patio at the back. We have ordered beef tartare, Summer salad as starter, scallops from raw bar, lobster spaghetti and mushroom linguini & other amazing dishes. Street parkings are available. It locates on a hippie neighborhood, alot of up and coming brands around, and the rest are already branded well perhaps. A cool evening dine out experience at Liverpool House. And don't forget they are the sister restaurant of Joe Beef."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"From the moment I got there (we were a party of 4 who reserved almost 2 months in advance to make sure we can get a table on a Thursday night at 7pm), the maitre D was lovely, very nice and approachable. Because I was alone for 10mins, I was checked on by a lot of different waiters to make sure I had water (sparkling or flat, on the house) and knew where the chalk boards were for the nightly specials. It's a very dim restaurant so if you want good food pictures, make sure to use that flash! Once our whole table was there, our awesome waiter (super chill guy - didn't catch his name though) explained every special to us and was genuinely entertaining! Went above and beyond in terms of service. Another great thing is that he wasn't pushy about us ordering wine which these types of restaurants normally are. To start, I ordered the wild mushroom shnitzel ($18). Mind blown. I would go back just for that! For my main, I OBVIOUSLY ordered the lobster spaghetti ($38) - I've been hearing about it for years now! It was the most decadent thing I've ever eaten. If you don't like butter or cream, DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH. A little over the top in my opinion, I would've loved some freshly cracked black pepper and some peas or something to break up that richness. Also, the second it cools down, it's not as good. My sister got the hanger steak ($33), which was excellent but the beans on top did not go with the steak... like what were they thinking? But I can't fault that meat, yum. Probably a good idea to order the wedge fries with it ($9). For dessert, we got the chocolate tart ($12). Another decadent dish, it's very rich dark chocolate, not very sweet at all. Served with nuts, sea salt and sour cream, I would've preferred slightly sweeter components like raspberries and whipped cream to compliment the bitterness from the chocolate. At $70 each without alcohol (but 20% tip), we left feeling satisfied. Will probably go back and try other menu items. Great vibes for groups!"

The only menu was on the wall, vaguely written, and it was so dark in the restaurant. It was impossible for me to read. We had a lobster spaghetti. The amount of lobster chunks was generous. The taste was nothing special to me. Honestly the food was just OK and overpriced, and I didn't get the amazing experience like other reviews."

But don't be fooled, the Liverpool House isn't easy to get into either. Make sure you make a reservation. I know the lobster spaghetti is the famous dish but I opted out. I went with the foie gras and rabbit for the appetizer. Then for my main, the duck. The sour cherries in both dishes were addicting. The staff and my cocktail were also in point.

Liverpool House has that same fantastic service you've come to expect from Joe Beef, but the vibe is a little more relaxed, a little more ""date night"" than ""reserve 3 months out night"" and this translates to a palpable energy, a warm, inviting buzz.

Two of us had the Lobster spaghetti which was delicious. My other friend had the pork chop.The restaurant was busy, buzzy and had a really nice atmosphere. Malcom was knowledgable and gave good wine recommendations. James - who I think was one of the owners was present in the restaurant making sure all the guests were happy, and he stopped by to chat.I would highly recommend a trip to Liverpool, but you should book in advance.

The food is inspired comfort fare that is still elevated to fine dining. I mean foie gras breakfast sandy?? Yes please. And I mean I've been looking forward to the rich lobster pasta all week.

Having already been to Joe Beef and loving it, I was really excited when I managed to snag a table for 2 on a Saturday night at 7 at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.The service was fantastic and attentive. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable with wines and when we told her what we were going to have she went looking for some great wines to pair. The wines were all between $60-$100 also so all within a reasonable price point (I just can't justify any more than $100 for a bottle of wine).The food of course did not disappoint either. We started with a very thinly sliced rib eye on toast special which was probably my wife's favourite dish. For mains I decided to go for the beef in Joe Beef and had the steak which came with steak sauce, horseradish and pickle on the side. My wife went for the lobster spaghetti which I also tried and was incredible. The shocker was we ordered some brussel sprouts on the side and these stole the show. Definitely the best brussel sprouts I've ever had with so much incredible flavour.Overall I have no complaints and would definitely head back to any of the Joe Beef restaurants."

It was so flavourful and had just the right amount of spice. It was garnished with one oyster, a celery, a pickle and an olive and the glass was rimmed with steak spice. We then had a glass of wine followed by another cocktail. The waitress was very generous when she poured the wine! We started with the deer tartare. I love tartare and this one was delicious. It did not taste gamey at all. It was fresh and had crunchy deep fried onions on top. The last time I went to Liverpool house I tried the foie gras breakfast sandwich. Think McDonald's breakfast but with foie gras!! I liked it but didn't order it this time because my boyfriend doesn't love foie gras like I do. For mains we shared the lobster spaghetti of course. If you are expecting a regular tomato based spaghetti you will be disappointed but I assure you this white creamy lobster spaghetti is a must! It was as amazing as I remembered. My boyfriend doesn't like spaghetti but he loved this one. I feel like the first time I had this dish at the restaurant there was more lobster in the pasta compared to this time but I think I still had about two pieces. The bacon in the pasta really adds flavour. We also shared the hangar steak with blue cheese. If you don't like blue cheese stay away but I enjoy blue cheese on my steak. I admit some pieces of steak were better than others but I guess that's to be expected. We didn't order dessert because we were too full. The portions are good and everything is delicious! I highly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=hkL2iB_5-ZC57zs5x9eEfA,Elijah G.,"Amherst, MA",4 star rating,"The short: this is a delicious, comfortable restaurant with friendly service that isn't afraid to take a few risks with interesting specials.This was one of the more expensive and more hyped restaurants I've eaten at in Montreal - so the expectations were pretty high coming in and the experience did not disappoint. The space is cozy, everyone we interacted with was personable, attentive, and knowledgable. I'll also note that I find it strange how long it takes to get a check at most places in Montreal, not the case here and that's a huge plus.We started with one special and one standard item - a whitefish/carrot crudo and grilled broccoli respectively. I love broccoli, so it's hard to make a misstep there in my eyes - this was good, it's all the additional bits that make the dish and that fact that it's grilled in large pieces with a nice char. The crudo was a hit too, flavors were clear and crisp while still being out of the ordinary - this was not the standard whitefish salad and not quite a ceviche. Generous portions on both.We had the famed lobster pasta - I'll save the gushing, it's as good as you've heard and read about. I grew up disliking lobster, and this dish is good enough to make me reconsider.The only miss was a crab sandwich in a sauce/gravy of sorts. The bread was a wonderbread type thing - maybe a nod to something I'm missing but it was too soft. A heartier bread with a bit more flavor would have grounded the dish and prevented the gravy from turning the whole thing into mush.We finished the meal with a trio of rum cakes - seriously sharp flavor from the rum balanced things out nicely. Not a standout, but not bad.Ultimately the food we enjoyed here was good enough to outweigh the dish we didn't love. The service is well paced, the servers are informative, and we'd definitely come back."

/user_details?userid=yawGdMRl37yW90Pc8Ku_2A,Julia P.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",3 star rating,"Good food yet Hyped and over priced. Eager to try a stalwart if the Joe Beef empire, we made reservations on a friday night. Only bar spots were left and once we arrived, we quickly realized that the cramped bar wouldn't be ideal and they were sweet to move us to a table once available. There in the dining room however, it was loud and tight. Don't bring your parents here unless they like loud music and tight quarters I warn you. Drinks -- no drinks menu. Um ok. Instead you have to squint in the dark at a huge chalkboard of messy cursive over diners' heads to decipher wine details and prices. Lovely. Not sure this is what entails a premium dining experience, no matter how hipster the neighbourhood may be. Not a fan. Our server was nice enough to read the board and made some suggestions for a bottle. Picked a good one for our meal. Food -- we kept it simple. Tartare appetizer, size of caraway carrots, and lamb shank for two. Tartare was great - mustard, yolk, cornichons in the mix already. Served with chips. Good, classic. Could have been bigger for 19$. Also it's hard to mess up tartare, people - you can't call yourself a French resto if so. Lamb for two -- delicious, sizeable portion, could have been in a dish that retains heat for longer as it cooled quickly while we ate. Strap yourselves in for an incredibly reduction sauce to go with it. And a ton of boring roast potatoes. When we asked to swap for another side whilst ordering, we were told that it's impossible and there aren't that many to begin with. Huge amount of potatoes in the portion of lamb, so just be aware when ordering. 128$. Carrot side was needed to add some colour and veg. Very good roasted carrots served with zesty sour cream dollop on top. 13$Overall, food was good but this should not have been a 300 dollar dinner. Ambience is loud and tight. Not my idea of a place to spend premium dining dollars. Will not be back. Thank you, am now over all the Joe Beef hype."

So needless to say I was very excited about eating here. Just a quick note on how much we love the restaurant decor. Our waitress was very kind and patient and walked through the whole menu with us and never seemed annoyed. If you walk out of there without ordering the Foie Gras Breakfast Sandwich, why did you even come?!!!!! We also ordered the raw scallops, which was a special, so fresh -tasted like the ocean. We also took the waitresses recommendation on the Guinea Fowl because when am I ever gonna get to eat Guinea Fowl again. I'm glad we ordered it. It had its own flavor, of course similar to chicken but definitely ubiquitous. We had that with the cauliflower (super yummy) and Joe's Potatoes (wtf!)If you find yourself rating this restaurant anything below 5 stars, just stay at home next time."

Instead, I started with the soft crab, clams, mussels & crisp vegetables with garlic aioli from the specials menu. The vegetables were extremely fresh & the soft crab was perfect. I followed this with foie gras & blueberries. This was my first taste of foie gras, and it was delicious.I'm grateful to have had this dining experience in Montreal & would most definitely do it again."

/user_details?userid=QiciohgD8N6vCty4vGL3pQ,Emily H.,"Louisville, KY",5 star rating,"Preparing for our trip to Montreal, we did the typical research: foodie TV shows, travel articles and, of course, Yelp. And in all of our studying, two names kept coming up: Frédéric Morin and David McMillan. So by the time we arrived, it's fair to say that their restaurants, Joe Beef and Liverpool House, were on our must-try lists and that we had some lofty expectations. Well, Liverpool House met those expectations and exceeded them, perhaps more so than any other restaurant ever has. For the first time, I truly wish there was a sixth star I could give a business. It was superb not only in food but also in service.I'll start with the service. My boyfriend and I had heard that both restaurants are tough to get into without reservations well in advance. Deciding to try our luck, we called ahead and were told that there weren't any spots available but we could show up and perhaps luck into a cancelation. So we did, and we did! The host was very gracious, and asked if we would be able to give up the table in an hour and a half for a later reservation. At the time, I thought an hour and half seemed like more than enough time to eat in this dark, sexy restaurant, but in all honesty, we could have stayed there for much longer. We were shown to our table, which as other reviewers have mentioned, was in close quarters to other diners. And our server (who we found out later is also one of the managers) was patient enough to go over the menu with us. The menu is written on a large chalkboard, in French. Considering our table was not near that area of the restaurant nor do we know French, it was great to have a guide. And he first guided us to the pig tails, a pork version of buffalo chicken wings. Yes, these were really pig tails, but the tails had been cut up in inch or so sections. These had a bit of a kick to them and were served with a Ranch-like dressing. They also had small bones in them, which our server/the manager warned us about. Definitely a high-end take on pub grub. And then for my entree, I got the much written about lobster spaghetti. Oh, the lobster spaghetti. One of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Instead of little bits of lobster mixed into the pasta, like you might see elsewhere, an entire lobster was presented in this spaghetti -- claws, tail and all. And boy did it hit the spot. Liverpool House used thicker spaghetti, which held on to more of the savory sauce. The serving size was also large, but I did not have any trouble finishing it off. This is last-meal material.We shared the Brussels sprouts -- another revelation. These were served in a sweet vinegar sauce, which brought something new to this trendy dish. I have tried to find a recipe for these online but am so far unsuccessful.My boyfriend got the trout, which was served whole with mushroom and cabbage stuffed inside. At any other restaurant, this would easily be the star, but next to these other dishes, it definitely played back-up singer. And then for dessert, we got the cheese plate, so that we could enjoy some more raw-milk cheese while in Canada. The server/manager recommended this cheese plate as well as a port-like Banyuls wine pairing. Just wow. The plate was served with warm, soft, thick, buttery, toasted bread, which was great for spreading cheese. The server/manager suggested a few types of cheeses as well as the spoonful of local honey. Now this is what a cheese plate should be. And the wine. We are trying desperately to find a way to get it in the states. It was sweet and warmed us up on that cold night. Throughout the meal, our cups never came close to empty, and our food came out fast. I loved the casual soundtrack that played while we dined, which included Blues Traveler, Justin Timberlake and other '90s and '00s hits. You could tell that while this restaurant takes its food seriously, it doesn't have a big ego about it. Plus the servers and staff seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. We watched other servers take care of the tables around us, and they all seemed happy to answer questions and full of pride and smiles. They also seemed to get along well with each other, helping each other out when needed. This was just such a fun place to be. And then when we left, the host had remembered us and made sure that we were able to enjoy everything, without feeling rushed to make it out before they needed the table for the 9 p.m. reservation. The restaurant was packed yet he kept track of everyone there. Great service and great food don't always go hand in hand. Liverpool House should be the standard other restaurants aspire to. I hope that I get to travel to Montreal again and enjoy this experience for a second time."

As an epicurean who is also obsessed with vintage and antique everything (don't come into my tiny apartment unless you're prepared to redefine the word hoarder), I wanted to stuff ourselves off vintage china and flatware and that we did. We stuffed ourselves to the gills with wine and lobster pasta and clams casino. Also, the most memorable dessert I have had, hands down: warm financier pear tart with frangipane. This financier was baked in a tart pan, nutty brown delicious, with a half a pear baked into it. I'd do anything for this recipe. Came with a cup of pear sorbet that was basically biting directly into the ripest pear of the season. So clean, so fresh. Liverpool House is the equivalent to a fine whisky/whiskey/scotch; warm, brown and glowing. I love that it's so warm and inviting inside while it's biting cold outside. Makes me feel like I'm in a cabin. Staff is incredibly welcoming. But, it's straight forward; if you order clams casino...you'll get exactly that. Not an ethnic rendition, not a fucking deconstructed version...just clams casino. And that's what I ordered. That's what I want.Moments of awkwardness: How is a place that was opened by a large man (Dave McMillan) not large or spacious enough to fit a large woman?! Dude, this space is so small and tight (cozy and intimate) that I could barely squeeze my fat arse in between other tables and chairs when I left.Standing in the corner with hoards of other people to stare at a chalkboard menu in the dark. Hella hard to decipher, hard to not feel pressure to make a split decision and again...stuck in the corner with a crowd of other people also trying to decipher menu.And still...I love it."

Filling for two. The sauce was thick and creamy. The spaghetti was nicely cooked. Seared Foie gras wasn't on the menu but the chef made it for us anyways. The flavour was good, nicely seared.

But we were not upset, because we knew we would be in for a treat here.The restaurant is cozy (to put it nicely) so be ready to know your dining mates. We were seated promptly and the restaurant writes specials on a blackboard towards the back corner. Slightly hard to read for some people, and our waitress didn't come to explain the specials to us either. Anyway... For appetizers, she ordered a scallop dish and I ordered the shrimp salad. For our mains, she got the famous lobster spaghetti and I got the rabbit legs with foie gras. The scallop was interesting, as they sat inside an opened can with some sauce. It was delicious. The shrimp salad was very tasty as well, and a perfect start to the meal. The lobster spaghetti was fantastic, rich, creamy, perfectly al dente pasta with chunks of lobster. But out of the two mains, the rabbit leg was definitely the highlight. Moist, flavourful rabbit legs with a giant chunk of foie gras sitting on top of some sauteed spinach. I don't think I've had a dish taste *that* good in a while. After mains, we ordered a tea and a dessert (which was a donut of some sort, with pistachio cream and other things). I also found the price to be reasonable. Coming from Ottawa, a similar meal would have been over $200. For what we got, I think it was an incredible meal at a great price. I may ignore Joe Beef and just keep coming back here."
/user_details?userid=MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A,Yvonne B.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"Our take-away from our experience at Liverpool House was that it was a destination. It is owned by the same people as neighboring Joe Beef and shares some of the drinks and renowned Lobster Spaghetti on the menu. Once you visit Liverpool House you can cross it off of your bucket list.It's strange. For such an expensive restaurant with delicious food and drinks, the interior borders on dingy. There's kitchy nostalgic pieces including a stuffed bird perched on top of a vintage soda cooler. The menus are written on blackboards on the wall. The are written exclusively in French. The poor server had to translate and recite the entire menu to us. Apparently she's used to it. We heard her do it three or four times while we were there.Speaking of which, there were many English-speaking tourists at Liverpool House. One table was a group of four boisterous locals who seemed just as comfortable as the casually dressed employees. I suppose it was hard for us to wrap our heads around paying $$$$ for dinner while dressed in ripped jeans.The portions of food were tremendous. Each of the three dishes we got could easily have been split between the two of us as a satisfying entree. We could have saved money and only gotten two of the three items we ordered.The brussel sprouts were our favorite. They were perfectly cooked. Only slightly charred on the outside - enough to make them crispy - but soft and succulent on the inside. They were fresh and verdant when bitten. The seasoning and sauce were perfect accompaniments to the sprouts making harmony to their song.I got the lobster spaghetti. Apparently it's the same recipe as Joe Beef. The lobster easily slipped out of the shells in perfectly cooked whole pieces of goodness. The lobster portion was truly generous. It was so generous that I didn't mind sharing with M. Normally I would jealously guard all of the lobster for myself and only give out nibbles when begged. The sauce with the spaghetti was rich and buttery. It was a really rich and creamy and amazing dish.M got the horse. She'd never tried horse before and thought, ""Why not?"" It was served as a huge, lean filet mignon and wrapped in bacon. The server explained that horse is such a lean meat that it must be served nearly rare and with bacon because it doesn't have a lot of fat to stand the fires of much cooking. She was right! M liked it, but it's not her favorite meat. She agreed that this was probably the best way for her to try horse; however, it sure was expensive.Neither one of us was able to finish our entire meals. Early on, I had to prioritize eating the lobster and skip the pasta. M favored my dish over hers and gave up most of her entree and helped me eat my lobster. We agreed that we should have only ordered one entree and shared it."

For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.

We couldn't get reservations to Joe so we decided to eat here. It has the same lobster pasta so we gave it a try. I liked the pasta it was filled with creaminess that is not overpowering or cheesy. Just the right amount. Big pieces of lobsters made it very appetizing. The portion of pasta is huge. I ate all the lobster and then took the rest home. My friend got the duck but she didn't like the duck breast portion where it felt too raw. I liked it a lot!! We also had mushrooms and zucchini to share. Nicely grilled with so much flavor. Also shared the spreadable foi gras. It came with this buttery fat that I didn't really like but just wipe it off and it's all good. Overall good but drinks are expensive!

The bartender also recommended an excellent red wine. I went with the fresh pasta with fresh razor clams. I had never had razor clams before and figured this would be the place to do so. Omg, so good. I could eat that every night. It seems like the menu changes frequently, but you can be confident whatever you order is going to be great. The guy next to me had the foie Gras breakfast sandwich and it looked huge and amazing. Best restaurant I've been to in Montreal and I have been coming about twice a year for three years."

The duck breast I had was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My wife ordered the trout but they brought her the lobster pasta. We told the waiter about the mistake, and they offered to replace it. But my wife took the dish any way out of feeling bad for the waiter. It's too bad they did not even apologize or say thank you. Instead, in the end when we ordered dessert, they repeated the order couple of times as if it was our fault the first time. Nevertheless, I still consider them providing good service compared to other places. They put the wine list on the chalkboard to make it look rustic and traditional, which is ok, but I think they should make also a paper version available for easy reading if someone needs it."

We started with the classic foie gras which was delicious, the homemade bread was the best ever.We had some of our neighbors brussel sprouts and lamb.Then came our beef for two, which was probably the best beef dish I've ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Our waiter was great, I'm not sure of his name he was very nice and helpful since neither of us can read or speak French we were completely dependent on him. My complaint would be that the beef for two is WAY, WAY too much food for two people. We were obviously visitors to Montreal and I felt so bad about wasting the food. Please either do a smaller portion or warn patrons.. The beef is enough for four! Also if you are sitting on the patio/garden bring your shades!"

You just won't find this absurd mix of incredibleness almost anywhere (except at APC, more on that in another review!). Seriously, I was blown away by this place. You are treated like a regular by these folks even if it's your first time here (as it was mine). They really do go out their way to make you feel as though you fit in here. I'm a blue collar guy, who happens to love and appreciate fine food and dining experiences. I dress pretty shabby, but here at Liverpool House I saw folks dressed to the nines, and I also saw a guy sporting Goodwill torn up blue jeans and a Star Wars T-shirt, and no one batted an eye at either patron.         Beyond the all inclusive atmosphere, is some incredible, delicious, and (importantly!) generous food. I can suggest only one thing, read the board with all the specials!!!!! Read it and order from it!!! I had some insanely yummy rabbit dish with pork belly that was stuffed with bacon (it's as insane and as delicious as it sounds). Oh, and did I mention that I was washing this all down with what was possibly the best pale ale I've ever tasted? Pale ales are usually pretty dull, low abv session beers you drink after work or after mowing your lawn. Not so here at Liverpool House, Mike (I think was his name) is a Matron'D here, but he daylights as a brewer (how cool is that?) and he was the guy that brewed this pale ale. I was shocked when after I told the bartender how much I loved the beer that Mike came over and talked to me about his brewing. Where does this happen? I'll tell you- nowhere. Again, this just speaks to how great a place this is. Did I fail to mention that I also ate some of the best oysters of my life here? Or that I sat with two beautiful and sweet Ladies from Ontario? Hey, you get the point if you've read all this. Liverpool House is the !&%^. Do yourself a favor and eat at this place!!!"

We had the lobster spaghetti and halibut, followed by the rum cake dessert and Banyuls aperitif.  The lobster spaghetti came with uncracked lobster claws.  The spaghetti was fresh made and nicely chewy, with an interesting nutty flavor to the sauce and bits of terrific dried smoked ham in the sauce.  The halibut appeared to be poached, was really tender and flavorful, with a hollandaise sauce and tiny lentils.  The rum cake came in 3 pieces, was really sweet and delicious.  The Banyuls Reserva (a mix with grenache as the basic grape) from Domaine La Tour Vielle was perfect - dark and sweet with a subtle and wonderful bouquet All in all, an outstanding dinner"

As a foodie - I scrambled to make reservations here once I had booked my ticket to Montreal and luckily scored one for 9pm. The menu is primarily written on the walls, but is somewhat difficult to read with the dim lighting. I wish I knew what fish dish I ordered (but my French is not all that great), and it was good, but nothing spectacular. Personally, I think it was a little overhyped. Maybe next time I would order some of their all-star dishes like lobster spaghetti, instead of opting for their less-pricey (about $30 dollar) fish dish. The customer service was great, and the waitress spent a great deal of time with chatting up her tables."

It's a pancake that takes 7 minutes in an oven. ) At 18$, ZERO stars.The Lobster Spaghetti 44$ was very good, tasty, creamy sauce, a couple nice pieces of lobster meat, pasta al dente - it was polished off, 5 stars. My Trout 32$ was lovely and simple, undercooked but properly so, sitting on a bed of steamed and lightly seasoned leeks.  If the trout had been served warm instead of tepid/cool, it would have been 4 stars. The chocolate slice with berries $16 was silky and very sweet but nothing special, 3 stars.Our server was polite but insincere - I didn't appreciate the poor excuse on the dessert, which he had promised would be spectacular. He saw my son barely touched it but charged the full $18 without offering something else.  I love dessert and crepes but it was like wet eggy sponge. Had our server taken care of the issue, we might be back for the lobster pasta, but as it is, No.  Our server was not interested in our overall experience (maybe because we didn't order alcohol?).  We also had to wait for the bill (though we had asked for it earlier) while he vivaciously talked up the table next to us who had ordered a couple bottles of wine, 1 star."
/user_details?userid=xnsdh6cnfmaP9hxada3jLQ,Elodie T.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"Liverpool was one of the highlights of our trip. We actually even debated coming back for a second dinner here before our vacation ended, just for the lobster ravioli! I don't really need to go into the whole thing with Anthony Bourdain and the owners of Liverpool House, which provided the basis for our decision to come here. My sister and I decided that we should do at least one nice, expensive dinner in Montreal/Quebec City, and this was it. Reservations were easy to make, even a week ahead- we set one for 6PM on a Tuesday. It was a little confusing because we did arrive a little early and although the Yelp indicates that they open at 5PM, our walk-by made us think they didn't open until later. Weird. Either way, we entered right at 6PM and were the first ones there, and got our choice of tables. We chose one right by the window, which provided us delightful natural lighting and the illusion of more space- as other reviews have stated, the space between tables is very small. As it was, we got an earful of our one side of neighbors' conversations (which I won't get into but wow, it was a mess)- I can't imagine being sandwiched by two tables with equally loud conversations!Although we came under the impression that they only had the chalkboard for their entire menus, they did have actual menus for us to peruse. The chalkboards held the specials, which were also described to us by our waitress. Ultimately, we chose and ate:Foie Gras with Concord Grapes: Pretty simple dish. Foie gras was good. I'm not sure I liked the pairing with the Concord grapes and bread, which I think overpowered the taste of the Foie Gras. Meh. Corn with Cheese Curds and Truffle: Surprisingly, this was one of the few dishes (if only?) that had truffle shavings on it. This dish was sooo good- everything paired really well together. Half order of Lobster Spaghetti ($28): Not gonna lie, I still occasionally dream about this spaghetti and look at my picture of it. It was soooo good that if we had come back, I'm pretty sure we would have gotten a full order of it. Lobster itself wasn't as juicy/moist as expected, but good. Spaghetti was magnificent! Perfectly cooked and delicious!Desserts were a little bit disappointing. There was just not enough contrast in textures and temperatures, imo. Profiteroles: I had imagined the chocolate ganache to be a bit warmer to contrast with the ice cream, but it wasn't. Didn't wow me. Apple Pie: Same deal- are we just too used as Americans to have warm apple pie with ice cream? This was room temperature apple pie. Not our favorite. Overall, still an excellent experience other than our can't-help-bc-we're-so-close eavesdropping, and the desserts. The place also got a lot busier as the night went by so the service was noticeably slower too. Solid 4/5 stars, especially for that corn & lobster spaghetti."

The ""sticky toffee"" dessert, even on a very full stomach, was amazing (thanks to the yelpers who have gone before me and highlighted it).  Again I must compare to Joe Beef and proclaim that Liverpool House was the winner in this course too.  So if you arrive at Joe's without a reservation and are directed to Liverpool, despair not!"

The bread pudding was simply fantastic, the creme fraiche ice cream made the dish.We also shared a special cabbage roll appetizer, which was rolled crab and sausage with a delicious (light) ginger sauce, and the lobster pasta special. The lobster pasta was good, and comes with more than enough lobster. If anything, I'd just recommend adding more sauce to that dish.

I made reservations way in advance, although, I don't think it is as tricky to get into as Joe Beef. I wasn't sure what to think when we first arrived- it is super cramped and looks like it is a restaurant in an antiques shop. However, every single course was actually perfect. We started with a seafood platter of PEI oysters, local sea urchin, and scallops. The oysters were simple, clean, with a briney aftertaste. The scallops were marinated in a veggie confit. That doesn't really make it sound amazing... but it was. It was really reminiscent of a Portuguese take on scallops. Lastly were the local sea urchin. This is one of the greatest dishes I had in all of Montreal. The sea urchins were so clean with a silky texture and the creme fraiche and chives  is a fun Gastropub play. We order two more right after finishing them bc they were so incredible. Next we had venison/deer tartar on a large tater tot. The texture balance was perfect, the deer was clean, and the dish overall was insanely good!Lastly, we shared the lobster spaghetti and a side dish of roasted delicata squash (have to get in some veggies!). The lobster spaghetti was everything everyone has mentioned- creamy, perfectly cooked lobster, heavy, delicious. Def get this iconic dish, but I recommend sharing it bc of its richness. The delicata squash was also amazing. Topped with evoo, a sunflower seed/herb sauce, and creme fraiche- I'm so happy we added this side dish.They have a full bar and my negroni was perfect (sweet in the front and bitter in the back). The service was kind and knowledgeable. Lastly the wine list was massive and a range of prices (loved our Pinot noir from the Burgundy region). Overall, jus adored this place!

From the time we were seated it took nearly 20 minutes before ANYONE came to read the specials, give us water, etc. It's as if they completely forgot about us which is bizarre because they were seating additional tables and reading the specials to people all around us. Having been to numerous high end restaurants before I was awe-struck. Finally I had to say something and a waiter came to address us. Despite the poor service I was determined to try the food so we ordered a bunch of dishes: the tartare, foie gras, oysters, lobster spaghetti, and chicken confit. The tartar and lobster spaghetti were amazing. The cream sauce was very good with a mix of creaminess and brine from the lobster. Foie gras was good but wasn't too impressed by the relish accompaniment and bun. The confit kind of fell flat. It was an impressive amount of food however I felt like the quality of food was a bit lacking and didn't live up to the hype.

Metered parking is available but if you don't mind a short walk, you can park for free in the surrounding area. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's probably 10-minutes from there (unless you're a fast walker). The place: While it IS a small and compressed space, this really didn't bother me. I like the cottage feel of the place as well as the decor (minus the big-a$$ deer head). We were seated in a corner right by the window (below the big-a$$ deer head) so we didn't feel claustrophobic or like our space was being invaded. The food: Let me start with what my friends ordered - the rabbit and the roast chicken. According to my friends, both dishes were amazing. The only comment was surrounding the chicken, which was a little dry in some sections but it wasn't a big deal. Other than that, the dishes were a hit. On my end, I went with the infamous lobster spaghetti. I know that I'm going to go against the grain here, but I wasn't really impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly - I like mine super al dente and that's what I got. In terms of the lobster, I have zero complaints about the portion - it was quite generous and the claws were meaty. That said, I found it to be somewhat lacking in flavor. I'm not a lobster expert so perhaps lobster is generally lacking in flavor? I dunno. As far as the broth goes, this was also lacking in flavor. Based on the reviews, I expected the dish to wow the sh*t out of me and it didn't. It was good but not fabulous.Where I did have the sh*t wowed out of me was dessert. We ordered the pot au chocolate, the Paris Brest and something else whose name I don't recall. Each dessert was decadent and bloody incredible. These guys are not cheap with their portions either - that goes for everything that they serve. Service: We were warmly received by the staff, and our waitress was super friendly. She took the time to explain the menu, make suggestions. Our water glasses were always full and our table was cleared quickly once we were done eating. The only thing that bugged me is that the busboy kept sticking his arms in my face while my friends and I were talking and he seemed oblivious to what he was doing. Price point: Steep. The spaghetti is $55. L-H is definitely a place you go to if you want to splurge."

One Fact: The food there is heavy (this is not a criticism in any way - but one should be aware of this before going there!!!).My go-to dish at LH is their ""Cote de Boeuf"" special. It is meant for sharing: enough quantity for 2-3 people and it includes some seasonal sides (cost: $110). I like it so much that, usually, I only go to LH when I can ascertain that my dining group will want to order this. It's always GREAT!!! If I just consider this... 4.5 stars.More generally, they do their ""meats"" quite well (including seafood). The other dish components and items are a mixed bag. For instance, at my latest visit, scallops w/ risotto were ordered. The scallops were excellent (!!!) but the risotto was bad (thin rice, watery, underseasoned). This is just one of several examples I've experienced over the last couple of years here.Odd Fact: They charge for their bread and butter ($2.50 for 3 or 4 slices of bread and one pickle). I guess that's fine - but I can imagine that this would annoy some folks because it's not particularly special bread.The restaurant itself looks stylish and has a unique charm (they have a canoe hanghing from the ceiling... and it stylistically works!). I'm less favorable about the service. It isn't terrible but it is definitely well below average."

Sounds like an order at the counter and sit and wait for your number to be called type of restaurant, right? Well, it certainly was not. Our server was the sweetest (and cutest) guy who was so accommodating and read off everything on the chalkboard for us. We ordered a bottle of wine (a VERY impressive list that covered about two blackboards in itself!), ordered the bleu cheese chicken wings and lobster spaghetti. Oh man. The food... just incredible. The wings were unlike any kind of wings I've ever tasted. The endive leaves that accompanied it with the bleu cheese sauce was incredible. The lobster spaghetti had flavors that had so much depth... I could've kept eating it and eating it until my own gluttony consumed my foodie soul.Prices are steep but the portions are very generous.

Atmosphere aside, the food is a knockout.Foie gras breakfast sandwich: if you like sweet and savory you will love this one, good to share 3-4 people. Lobster spaghetti : creamy lobster spaghetti, can't go wrong, it was delicious as it is satisfying.  Could do without the eclair, but you didn't come for dessert anyway. Shout out to our server who drapes a towel over the cold A/C vent."

I had the Razor Clams with lobster mayo as a started and buddy had the smoked meat coquettes. They made a mistake with my order and I got the clams but they recognized it and the said it was on them and gave me the Razor Clams on the house which I thought was very generous of them. The clams came in a veggie broth with stewed veggies and this insane slice of garlic and parsley bread. Seriously, I could eat that bread all night. My friend enjoyed the coquettes immensely.The Razor Clams came in their shell with the lobster mayo garnished with garlic chips. It was amazing.Then came the Rib steak for two. We ordered it medium-rare but it was more rare if you ask me, in it's own juices. It came with a side dish of Bubble and Squeak, a mish-mash of potatoes, meat and veggies mixed up together. Seriously, this was a HUGE piece of meat but buddy and I managed to eat up most of it. We both wanted to keep some room left for dessert. What was leftover of the steak and Bubble and Squeak, we were able to take home so we could enjoy dessert. With classic stand-bys like Chocolate Pot au Creme, Cheesecake, you can't go wrong. My friend ordered the classic Australian dessert, the Grapefruit Pavlova (meringue) and I had the Chocolate Pot au Creme. We shared and both were fantastic. The pavlova is the perfect dessert if you want something light.i think the only thing which took away from the experience was the noise level. Gosh it got loud and I could barely hear my friend over the table. I understand the whole Joe Beef/Liverpool House ethos and vibe, casual, shabby chic with very high end food and wine but if I want to enjoy a wonderful dinner with a friend, I'd like to be able to talk to them and hear them without each of us raising our voices to be heard so for that, I have to take a star off.Nonetheless, if they can somehow fine-tune the noise level, it's still an awesome restaurant to go to with wonderful food, drink and service."

I love the vibe inside, but especially love the patio as it is quieter and quite atmospheric in a laid back sort of way.Our server was very nice and helpful.For appetizers we ordered rabbit pasta with fettuccine and pea sauce. It was so good I would give it 10 stars. It is not always on the menu, but if it is when you go, I recommend a large order of it as your main. We ordered Lobster Pasta (they're known for it) and a steak. Both were delicious. The lobster pasta is a large order and very rich. I recommend the smaller size, as I couldn't finish it and I almost always finish everything. The lobster was sweet and delicious and the creamy red sauce was perfection. My husband's steak was good, but not as good as the other things. Our desserts were fabulous. I had the profiteroles and he had a brioche with creme fresh ice cream. He raved about it. I recommend you make a reservation as soon as you book your flight!"

I eat a plant based diet -- and was so touched by the chef's willingness and ability to craft AMAZING dishes without advanced notice. They served an heirloom and basil salad with the freshest tomatoes. Followed by a mushroom and bean pesto pasta that my carnivore enjoyed as well.  And lastly -- a light and fresh fruit salad was served for dessert. My colleagues raved about the chicken dish and the lobster pasta as well.

It makes you happy. In all the ways a restaurant can and should. The dishes are hearty but still balanced and thoughtfully executed. The vibe is homey, fun, and classy. The service is great and the staff is awesome. There are, in sum, no things not to love about Liverpool House (double negative intentional). I wish I had multiple stomachs or more time to come back on this Montreal trip to try more dishes, but everything we had was between unbelievably fucking delicious to excellent: including the foie gras bfast sandwich which is life changing and caused both me and my wife to shed single tears of joy while eating and later tears of sadness knowing it would be long before we could eat it again. Then we had the lamb ribs which were a special of the day, which took all the things that can suck about ribs of any kind, like the boney chewiness or overpowering sauces that stick to your lips, and provided all the things I love about them; fatty, salty, juicy, deliciousness balanced out with some acid and bitterness(?) from what imo was something like a chimichurri sauce topped with heirloom tomatoes. This dish almost nearly changed my life again. Lastly, maybe because I am weak and boring and if I see steak on a menu at a sister restaurant of Joe Beef, I ordered the striploin. Do I regret it? No. It was also delicious and excellent. However maybe I could have been more adventurous, and maybe soon, when we come back and I get to all three of Joe Beef, Le Vin, and Liverpool I will be bold and get something with lots of internal organs that I am sure they will somehow make delicous too."

I'm more of a ""sit at the bar"" type of gal myself, so had no trouble with this suggestion. Our only mistake while here was that we ordered wine by the glass instead of the bottle, because we eventually drank the whole bottle.As for food, we started with the Foie gras, which I was super worried about. My boyfriend urged me to give it a try and I actually really enjoyed the dish. For our entree, we opted for the Lobster Spaghetti, and I would swear on my unborn child that this is the best seafood pasta dish I have ever enjoyed (I'm from Florida, I know seafood). Honestly, I can't remember if we got dessert or not because of the wine. But, I do recall that our bartender was so friendly and helpful.Near the end of the night, after dessert, he asked if we wanted coffee. I never drink coffee but figured a cappuccino might help get me out of my seat. When asked if I needed sugar, I replied: Bring me all your sugar. He brought about 7 full jars of sugar, it was a you need to be there moment. At the end, he gave us a shot on the house 'cause he thought we were humorous. All in all, this was our best meal in Montreal and I will absolutely return the next time I'm in the city."

Sometimes you just don't get the concept of a restaurant. Other times you may just not be a fan of the current menu. I assure you that nothing about this visit was a misunderstanding or me and my wife not ""getting it."" It started with very poor service. I will admit - our server was attentive. However, she couldn't remember what we ordered. On three different occasions, she came back to us asking if we wanted to order different dishes...even though she simply didn't put them into the kitchen. From butt-to-chair to the first item served, it took 30 minutes. That was for the cocktails we ordered. A bit long, but fine. Sometimes the bar can be slow. From food order to food, it took over an hour to get our appetizers. The dinner service continued to be just as slow. The entire dinner took three hours and we ordered two appetizers, oysters, and two mains. In terms of the quality of the products: the oysters were delightful, the drinks were decent, the duck hearts were great, and everything else was poorly cooked. The fish was dry and under-seasoned. The duck and potatoes I received were truly nuked. I was so disappointed with how long it took me to get my dish that I just ate half, skipped dessert, and settled my bill. I see so many good reviews for this place and understand the quality of the food from the founders. Unfortunately, our meal was truly one of the worst we've had this year. I think we probably just had poor stars align for us, but, given how disappointed we are, I felt the need to leave this review. All the best to the team, but, if you expect people to pay a premium for your food, you have to bring it for every table, every night. We unfortunately got a very poor effort."

There was wine (lots), raw meats (horse tartare), giant slabs of meat (hanger steak in a barley and beef cheek sauce) and the token vegetable (brussel sprouts).

You just know everyone is having a great time and enjoying themselves-Liverpool House was no exception. I was surprised they have a nice little patio behind the restaurant. It would be great in the summer. The server was great at explaining all of the dishes in English even though he was busy. At Liverpool house, go big or go home.We tried the breakfast foie gras, grilled clams, Brussels sprouts and horse tartare for appetizers. The stand outs were the brussel sprouts and breakfast foie gras. The brussel sprouts were deep fried and doused in a spicy honey sauce. Addicting. The breakfast foie gras was pretty much a meal in itself and everything melded so well together. I would return just for that dish. The grilled clams were a tad fishy. The horse tartare wasn't too bad. I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised at how lean and tender it tasted. I expected the texture to be more tough. I would've preferred more seasoning and smaller pieces. Our mains consisted of the lobster spaghetti, rainbow trout, duck and steak. The lobster spaghetti was massive-buttery and rich. The steak was decent but not out of this world. The duck was solid although I'm not sold on the pairing with olives. The trout cooked perfectly and tasted great with the butter sauce. They served mashed potatoes with peas for the table which tasted great with the butter sauce from the trout. Stand alone it was fine but unnecessary since the portions were huge. Solid restaurant but I did feel slightly disappointed. Mainly because my expectations were too high given all of the good reviews and ratings. We made reservations a month in advance for June."

/user_details?userid=Eqk0ppInDgtFSuBjbchfmQ,Tina L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Had been looking forward to trying this place out for a while. Decided to be adventurous with our waiter and asked him to surprise us with our menu options. The appetizers that he ordered were fresh and fun to eat. The main course on the other hand were 2x pasta dishes . The pasta dishes were both awful. What seemed to be the owner offered to change our plates but actually never did. One of the pasta bowls was left untouched and the other the person with the dietary issues eat the pasta bowl with dairy because no one came back to change our order ( we were sitting at the bar). Once the bill came through they didn't even have a care in the world to take it off the bill. The menu is short and sweet and normally I'm good with that but this time around I say this place is a AVOID . Way to expensive for the experience you get .
/user_details?userid=skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",5 star rating,"Before we talk Liverpool House, let's talk Joe Beef. Mr. Beef is high on my restaurant bucket list (inclusive of not unpopular dining establishments like Noma, Jiro, and liquor-licensed Taco Bell). Unlike some other luminaries, I finally had a clear and easy shot at checking this off the list, thanks to a friend's decision to host his bachelor party in Montreal. Quite unfortunately, despite a couple month's advance warning, reservations were not to be had. Getting through to via phone Joe Beef is an ordeal in itself, let alone speaking to someone in a rational manner in order to procure said reservation. Alas.The biggest hangup was our large party (of 10), but our coordinator sold us (and Mr. Beef's purveyors) on Liverpool House, Joe's younger, larger sister restaurant. So while Joe Beef remains bucketed, I at least had a chance to sample the goods. I apologize profusely for the lack of photographic evidence, as Liverpool's hearty spread was enough to feed a small army, and quite deliciously, I might add. I chalk it up to a full slate of day drinking prior, and we were just lucky enough that the groom-to-be made it through the evening. A prix fixe dinner with something like 7 different courses and plates ended up coming to a very respectable price, not inclusive of the mountains upon mountains of Old Fashioneds or something other whiskey cocktails that we ended up ordering that night.The highlights are the meats, obviously, anything meat. Like Joe Beef, Liverpool House's menu is always chalkboarded, such that the only menu I have is questionably stored in my noggin. However, I do remember the lobster spaghetti, and it's good. To quote Joe Beef aficionado Anthony Bourdain, damn good. The red meat, of which we received two kinds, boneless and bone-in, were also phenomenal. Starter oysters? Yes.The whole evening was an exercise in pure, gluttonous decadence. And while I didn't technically get Joe Beef in my mouth, I still came away feeling plenty satisfied."

For a place that is charging upwards of $40-50 a plate I would hope they can get some AC, but again, this may be a normal thing in Montreal so I am putting it out there as a disclaimer and not holding it against them.We had three dishes in total, the pressed lamb flank, the lobster spaghetti and a special of the day which was pojarski (veal stuffed with liver I believe). The appetizer was the lamb flank and I happily rate it a 5/5. It was a fantastically flavor piece of lamb, a good amount of fat, but not chewy. I shared the lobster spaghetti and pojarski with my girlfriend and oh my were both extremely rich! The lobster I unfortunately have to give a 3/5 rating. It was good and better then a few other similar dishes I have had, however at $55 a pop and being the number one hyped dish, I guess I just expected a bigger wow factor. Having said that, first bite four stars, by the end of the dish three. Finally the pojarski, I ordered this with having absolutely no idea what it was and ended up asking the server after I got the dish. It was very good and extremely rich. If you are into liver and extremely rich, powerfully flavorful food, this is the dish for you. Sadly it was a little too rich for my taste so I have to give it a 4/5.Since I think we may have ordered two of the richest and filling menu items (other then the one pound steak they offer) we sadly had no room for dessert.I may still have given Liverpool House a five star rating, but in the end of the day I ask myself, 'would I come back here?' And the answer is no, the food is great, but the prices are too high for not having the most amazing experience.I am very happy I came to try it once though.

(Lesson learned: make reservations at these places.) But, darn it, it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten. And for less that $100? An absolute steal!!!!!! And it's not like one of those expensive meals that are 3 bites worth of food. It's a ton of food, and you will want to eat it all.I could barely understand the menu in English or French. When the waiter explained, I looked for words that I understood, and this is what happened: I went twice in my one week trip. I think I ate some oysters, beer, sausage, rabbit, lobster pasta, pork shoulder, chicken, foie gras, bread, zucchini bread, roast carrots, potatoes, potato salad, roast brussel sprouts, some ridiculous cheese stuffed with more cheese, beer, and some ridiculous gin and earl grey tea concoction. And dessert. Go for the sorbets. They are amazing.I went by myself and was seated at the bar. Lone dining is kind of sad, and so I befriended a Torontonian who was also rejected at Joe Beef and we shared some of our food stuff. I spent about $80 by myself (oysters, beer, entree, dessert, complimentary shot, tax and tip). I ate so much, and I at all the things. It hurt so good.I went with a group of 8 people. FYI if you have more than 6 people (there are 7 in my family) then you have to eat family style (thank the food gods). This means that you can't all order your own entrees, and you shouldn't, the portions here are super generous, and worth every bite and every penny. We didn't order very many drinks, and all in all spent $60 per person (all the foods, tax and tip). If you are looking for a world class dining experience, wonderful friendly service, generous portions, and a price that can't be beat. This is it, and you'll be disappointed as you meet all your future meals after this one. Also, they'll pack left-over doggie bags for you."

So we tend to enjoy our fois when done right. Although good this style terrine isn't something we're into. It leans towards the more stiff style paste & we like our fois more melt in your mouth. This is for more acquired tastes since the liver taste is much stronger. It's also a large portion. Which we could only eat a certain amount until the strong liver taste started getting to us. The few first bites were fine though.-Spaghetti Homard Lobster (4*). Delicious dish. My wife liked it much more than I did. The spaghetti was coated in this buttery, slightly cheesy sauce, which wasn't overpowering, it was subtle but flavorful. With chunks of lobster sprinkled in."

I had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and it melted in your mouth and well seasoned. It was so good that I finished the 16oz all by myself!Lobster Spaghetti (1.5lb) - A generous portion of lobster with shells with al dente spaghetti.

I wanted to take my friends visiting from out of town to Joe Beef, but we couldn't manage a reservation, so I figured Liverpool House would do.We got the horse tartar as an appetizer, and for mains, the scallops, rabbit and duck dishes (I don't remember their full names). I wanted to order the horse steak but they didn't have it that day. I had loved the horse tartar at Joe Beef, and I loved it too at Liverpool House. The scallops and duck were good, but the rabbit was a little meh. All three dishes had a good amount of delicious (but very heavy) sauce. No one brought us bread voluntarily but I asked for it and got it. Bread is a great vehicle for sauce. While the food was good (though not spectacular), my experience was tainted by the service and atmosphere. And despite waitstaff constantly walking around the restaurant, they weren't particularly attentive and it was hard to get service most of the time. But what was the most annoying was the volume. We were seated at the table closest to the kitchen, which is also next to the bar. First, the kitchen is loud. Second, one of the staff at the bar was drying or polishing a seemingly never ending supply of cutlery in a way that produced a lot of noise, of cutlery hitting each other. I can deal with loud chatter, but the sharp clanking of cutlery was really, really unpleasant and lasted for about 30-40 minutes.Maybe I had unrealistic expectations for this place by thinking it would match Joe Beef even in service, maybe things would have been better if I had been seated elsewhere. But I left disappointed, and with a hole in my wallet."
/user_details?userid=aomkMAGFrL-gD6cqQjB4bw,J C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Having had an spectacular experience at Joe Beef on my last trip to Montreal, I gave the sister restaurant Liverpool House a try.Like with Joe Beef, service was great and food was excellent.  However, I think Joe Beef is significantly better than Liverpool House.  The menu at LH is smaller and seems to feature the franchise's 'greatest hits' whereas Joe Beef seems more seasonal and experimental.  I do appreciate that LH seems more bar-casual (not that JB is 'stiff' in any sense).The lady and I enjoyed all the dishes and they were accommodating in modifying some dishes to suit her pescatarian diet.  I finally got the lobster spaghetti as it was $35 (was told it's a smaller portion than the $55 portion at JB).  It sounded reasonable for one person to take it on, so I ordered it as-is (as it comes with bacon).  Even without our excessive ordering, the spaghetti should be shared between 2 - 3 people.  The dish was insanely rich and decadent.  The only 'downside' is that we were completely stuffed at the end, we probably would have enjoyed it more if we didn't over-order (our server at JB correctly told us to stop ordering after he felt we had already ordered 'enough'... and he was right).There was a slight snafu and they messed up on our order and we got additional dessert for free.  The complimentary basque cake was splendid.  The only black mark on the night: we ordered the 'corn ice cream eclair' because it sounded interesting - it tasted like something you would get a county fair.Overall, had a good experience at Liverpool House, but I prefer Joe Beef.  Will try out their newer restaurant, Vin de Papillon (all 3 being on the same street) next time."

We went here as part of a Montreal weekend where my wife is trying to emulate Anthony Bourdain ""Layover"" in Montreal. We hit the usual spots over the previous 24h: Schwartz , Fairmont etc. All as expected and I am feeling the Montreal groove. We head here because we can't get in to Joe Beef- so let's do the sister resto. As we arrive in the 'hood I am feeling it's the Montreal version of Oz/Dundas in the centre of the Universe (Canada style). On arrival, it looks and feels cool but the initial reception is bland and the server cool. The cocktail offering, completely cookie cutter. I am thinking ""Jenn Agg smokes these jokers at the Hoof"". From then on however it's an onslaught of excellence. Great wine list. We had the Monts Damnes Sancerre. The food after that was just spectacular. The usual Quebec superb lineup of foie and later cheeses. Lamb, bass, and lobster spaghetti were stars. Vibe: crackling. Tunes: Classic Seger followed by perfect Stones as we nibbled foie gras. (You have to be there I guess but it seems like they read my mind). And the server is terrific at this point. Bottom line is I have to give thumbs up to this member of the Montreal lineup. It just doesn't get much better. Anywhere."

Get a reservation in advance though, the place is usually packed. You can also use this app called DINR, that tells you if there are any free seats in the best restaurants in Montreal.

Ordered a couple oysters, a squash flower special with pesto dip (amazing!), fois gras with cranberry jam and dinner rolls (first time trying the fois!), the rabbit leg special (kind of dry and underwhelming), and the lobster spaghetti (had to). With the exception of the rabbit, the food was amazing. Well executed, and delicious. Also had a corn ice cream eclair for dessert, which was over the top at that point, but worth it.

Mains were hanger steak, chicken, and a branzino and all were all phenomenal. My favorite was the seafood tower and a brussels sprout they made for my vegetarian friend---SO FREAKING GOOD I'D GO BACK JUST FOR THAT.

/user_details?userid=lncyEB1YioOcX8tAtPKrMQ,YJ W.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I almost felt obliged to write about this place. I'm usually very hesitant about giving out a 5-star review to a dining place, just like how i see a box office hit with a healthy take of incredulity. After all it should be very personal experience isn't it? Like some of the other reviewers below, I was bumped from Joe Beef for not having booked in advance, and was made aware of its sister restaurant right next door. My french isn't that good to understand the menu on the blackboard so i studied it by taking a photo and ended up picking the trout with cauliflower souffle. And I was impressed. I mean, when you saw a whole deboned trout presented in its most complete and original shape, you know they are serious about food. I'm not sure how often they change the menu though, and I'm not even saying I made a good choice of food here, because I seriously think you wouldn't go wrong with any selection. In my definition of quality dining, I'm supposed to feel happy when seeing my plate, and can still remain happy throughout the entire course (a side note, I was eating alone at the bar, which made the whole happiness even more invaluable).To give you an idea of the price, a glass of wine, several oysters plus the main course would easily put you in the $60's range. Not the most pricey meal i've had, but certainly worth every dollar spent. The neighborhood is a bit lackluster to an out-of-towner, but don't be discouraged. The restaurant is made for you."

/user_details?userid=s8nkbQAlrVPfg1u4anGKtw,Kelly S.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Whoosh! Our first dining experience in Montreal and how glorious it was. Thankfully, a friend of mine was able to get us a late reservation on the Thursday we arrived. We were shown to our table, a teensy affair jammed next to the people behind us. It's dark, sexy, intimate... but they were playing Biggie, Timberlake and all these 90s hits. Love the juxtaposition. We ordered a glass of wine, a beer, half a dozen oysters and the pancetta to start. Those oysters? Best I've ever had, hands down. They were the Southlake kind and when you add some of their magic mignonette, a perfect bite. Our dinner was comprised of a giant sirloin and lobster spaghetti, two things which our server indicated were always on the menu. The lobster spaghetti was creamy, buttery awesomeness topped with in-shell lobster. I still don't know what they did to that steak but it was red all the way through with a char that can only come from some serious kitchen equipment. Here's what's good to know about this spot: -- The small tables/area is pretty typical of Montreal restaurants (we were quick to learn) but it's really packed in there. If I wanted to move, either the person behind me had to or I had to basically shift my chair 90 degrees every time.-- The menu is written on the chalkboard wall. Yes, this is cool in theory - especially since the menu changes a lot -- but in practice makes it quite difficult to order. Either you're hovering over someone trying to read the menu on the wall or craning your neck from the table. Neither of those are deal breakers but it's something to be apprised of before you go in. Our service was excellent, the place is spendy but not outrageously so for what you get and I'm just sorry we didn't have room for the foie gras."
/user_details?userid=ZkpNHYyPVmw1_zihmPGtIA,Uncle J.,"Portland, ME",5 star rating,"I think if I lived in Montreal, or at least closer, I would make a reservation for this place every few months. Joe Beef and the Liverpool House were names I kept hearing over and over every time I mentioned an upcoming Montreal trip to someone. So, even after the reservation was made I had to wonder what the experience would be like. Would they, already having established themselves as this landmark Montreal eatery, be pompous and impatient? Sneer at my lack of knowledge of French wines? Well, I'm laying it on a little thick, but the answer was absolutely not. Some of this surely had to do with our excellent waitress. Her name escapes me, but young, dark hair, clearly knew the place from the inside out. She made us feel like we belonged there from the moment we sat down, asking what sort of drink mood we were in, which led to me having one of the most amazing beers I have ever had (per her strong suggestion), a saison from Brasserie Morin, which she noted was owned by a brother to one of the owners of Liverpool House. She picked out a cocktail for my girlfriend by taking note of her mood and tastes as well and conferencing with the bartender, which turned into a Paper Plane that she raved about. I would like to believe everyone's experience is like this, but the gentleman who sat the table next to us pointed them to the chalkboard of specials and advised them to go take photos of it to reference before ordering. I won't lie and say it wasn't kind of comical to watch people stand in the middle of the dining room taking photos of a chalkboard that they surely could barely see once they got back to their table, but it was a little funny. Probably a little off-putting to some though. Thankfully our waitress also swept in and told them that staring into their phone photos wasn't necessary as she explained everything on the board in full. All of our food was delicious, some beef cheeks, a braised veal shank and a salad, but the rabbit terrine... wow. Worth the trip alone. I'll have that and that Morin saison in my dreams for a while. The ambiance was cozy, homey, and felt like you were amongst friends. The seating is somewhat close to each other, but that probably leads to some great inter-table conversations once the drinks get flowing. Then again, the table to one side of us was occupied by some just horrible, rude people so I guess it goes both ways... such is life in public settings. We made reservations at least a month in advance and the Liverpool House did not disappoint. If we thought we could have gotten in a second time the week we were in town, we surely would have tried it. However, the more I reflect back on our dinner and I tell friends ""they made us feel so at home"", ""they weren't snooty at all"", I realize I'm actually talking about our waitress who stole the show. Bravo all around."

We waited and first sat about 10:30. The waitress took about 30 minutes before she came over and took very little time with us explaining the all in French blackboard menu. Once we decided on a few well known to me choices ( only because I read my fellow Yelpers reviews), we waited at least a half hour for our first course, fresh oysters. At one point about 15 minutes into the wait, I asked for bread as it was already close to 11 and we were starving. She finally brought over bread (actually tasty bread) and then the oysters followed 15 minutes later. So now it's well after 11, we have consumed a great deal of wine and the appetite is waning. The oysters were very delicious as was the horseradish sauce for topping.Another 15 minutes, now 11:30 out comes the 4 appetizers. Mozzarella salad with bacon (actually a burrata and quite good) , a beet salad, a ricotta dish and a Bellini with gravlax with caviar. All were very good and were the type of dishes I was hoping for but would have enjoyed so much better at 10:15/10:30 when I wasn't drunk, tired and a bit annoyed.The mains were the lobster spaghetti and the hanger steak. Both excellent tasting but as above its now almost midnight, I'm drunk from the  long wait, too much wine, no food and I'm first eating my dinner.So now the host comes over who I admit was a very nice guy but I wish he would have checked on us an hour earlier. I asked him if this was typical and he told me that it was a holiday crowd but typically it is this busy.  He was very apologetic and offered anything we would like. By this time we were quite tired. The waitress brought over her self chosen classic chocolate cake with ice cream and 4 cappuccino. Along with dessert, a few after dinner drinks. The waitress told us the drinks, dessert and coffee were on the house. This is such a crazy review for me to write. On one hand, early lousy attention to their customer put a major damper on the meal and experience. On the other hand, excellent creative food and a highly apologetic staff who did the right thing by comping us the above. So confused by this restaurant. For now a 3 star rating because a restaurant this well known, with creative genius chefs and $49 lobster spaghetti dish, should have got it right from the start.  As a tourist only here for 3 nights, I would have really like to have been wowed by the experience overall as other Yelpers have reviewed.Maybe next time."

Both were incredible and had wonderful heat. We also ordered the tartar cause you kind of have to. It was really good and canceled out any guilt I had from ordering. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts which was one of the best flavor profiles I have had and I love my sprouts!  Lastly we tried the famous Montreal breakfast sandwich with foie gras, farm egg and local maple syrup.

A thing like that!If you love food then The Liverpool House is your Shakespeare and the dishes are sonnets love sonnets designed to swoon you out of your pants (or at least unbutton it due to the gluttonous effect it will have to your waist). It's a bustling atmosphere with intimate spacing. The aesthetics is cool with effortless charm and character. We were early for our reservation but was seated promptly. The menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall but unlike our time at Joe Beef they gave us paper menus. I take away a star because we asked for some food to be wrapped so we can take it to the hotel with us but we never received it and we felt rushed to leave our table. We started with a lovely Horse Tartare topped with a small salad and raw egg. I have absolutely no qualms about eating horse (a romanticized pretty version of a cow), and it was one of the better tartare I have. Hubby had the half rabbit with fiddle head fern and rabbit roulade. Tender and delicious.The highlight of the night (and of our Montreal/Quebec City trip) was the Foie Gras Breakfast Sandwich with a sunny-side up egg, bacon, and maple syrup. Oh My Gras! Each indulgent bite was rich and heavenly. I highly recommend this dish.The food is a bit pricey but not to extravagant; for 1 appetizer, 2 entree, and 2 beers the bill was 129.70 CAD/ 99.20 USD. I say that is a steal for the well crafted decadence they present.Note-They are open from Tuesdays to Saturdays from 5pm to closing-A short walk from station Lionel Groulx and around the area of the Atwater Market"

For entrees, we chose the lobster pasta (permanent menu item) and a Cornish game hen. Both were tremendous. Perfect amount for a couple to share. We finished the night with a dessert that was half chocolate pudding, half chocolate mousse (I can't remember the name of it) and two coffees! This was a great dinner.

We were seated immediately and started with a Tom Collins. I'm not usually a gin drinker, as I have seen some of the most manly men I know, reduced to tears by gin but when it is on the chalkboard...why not? A mean, Tom Collins was the general consensus.  Then the Onslaught of pork began. We started with pulled pork cigars. Succulent, smokey, pulled pork with the right amount of bark, wrapped in garden fresh, Boston lettuce and tied together with a chive. Awesome. Next up, deconstructed(kinda)BLT. Not overly pretentious, it was more of a self serve BLT. Boston Lettuce, garden fresh tomato, house bacon, mayo, stack of crostinies and a peck of steak tartar. Decadent. Then the Pork chop came. Despite societies nonacceptance of the word, the only mot juste that comes to mind is...retarded. A house snausage, marrow bones and a big hunk of pig, cooked to perfection, smothered in a veal stocky, barbequish type sauce, that, when I ran a piece of cop through, split like the red sea, held like divine intervention and then slowly resumed its original form.  Really decadent.  Second time 'round  9 o'clock again. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of getting to know Thomas, a great bar keep and all around nice guy. He served up a couple Kentucky...um...somethingorothers...they had chartreuse in them. Ask Tom, he'll know.  Then the seafood onslaught began. Half a dozen fresh, perfectly shucked, plump oyster, wading in their liquor, to start. Served with mignonette and cocktail sauces. Tasted like the ocean.  Next up, crisp asperge with fork tender, smoked swordfish and a foie gras cream.The swordfish was the best fish I have ever tasted. It fell apart as I rolled it in my mouth with my tongue while the smokey flavour encompassed my palate, complimented by the crunch of the asparagus and then the smooth flavour and texture of the cream. Not too much but just enough. Therapeutic.  Finally, a salt crusted arctic char, along with enough clams to choke a donkey and salsa Verde and hollandaise on the side. This was the second best fish I have ever had. Juicy, flavourful, stuffed with herbs and when doused in the hollandaise, forgetta 'bout it. Delicious.  To conclude, Go.Waka Waka."

Got the halibut instead, which I found to be over cooked and dry. For $38 I expected a more impressive dish. The scallops were also over cooked and chewy. Out of all the courses, I was most impressed with dessert. The sticky toffee pudding and mocha pot de crème were amazing. Will stick to Vin Papillion in the future."

Knowing that pre-set usually means lots of meat in Montreal, I explained that I was a pesce-tarian with a restricted diet and they quickly jumped to absolutely the best hospitality.

I had looked forward to dining at this restaurant but the quality of the food is so far below it's reputation that the absurd prices, far from confirming the excellence of the meal, just appear to the disappointed diner as exorbitant. The Duck Terrine was tasteless, overcooked and as if wrapped in dried out salt pork. The razor clams were rubbery and the diner was only able to taste vinegar and onion. The veal liver was nicely-cooked, tender and flavorful but, in the end, just liver. The Walleye was poorly cooked, crispy on the outside but without any texture or flavor on the inside. The service was decent, but that isn't hard to do when the customers are jammed together, practically sitting in each other's laps. The wines are good and pricey. Overall, if you are interested in quality food, avoid this place."

Two years ago I had reservations at Joe Beef that I could t end up making, so I vowed that on this trip north nothing would stop me. So that's how my partner and I ended up at Liverpool House on a Tuesday night. We had reservations at 6. Initially we were one of two parties but that didn't last long, the tiny space quickly became packed. Luckily, we had a good opportunity to check out the menu before people were sitting in front of it. Partner speaks no French and mine is rusty at best. Our delightful waitress was more than happy to explain everything and answer any questions.  She was also very patient with our ordering style, ""I'll take another drink, whatever you recommend""We started with drinks-beer for him and a bloody Caesar for me. Drinks kept flowing through the night. I recommended the caesar as well as the Moscow mule. We split a winter salad to start. Assorted greens with grilled veggies, shaved park, and apple cider vinegar. Partner had the Liverpool steak and I had the lobster spaghetti. Both were fabulous. Finally, we ended with a sticky toffee pudding dessert. I would have kicked the plate if it was more socially acceptable. The entire experience from ambiance to good to service was utterly delightful. I've marked it off the bucket list, but would gladly visit again!"

We also had the garden salad which was large and refreshing but slightly overly apple cider vinegary. We then went all out with the lobster spaghetti which was what you would expect: a whole lobster (in the shell as opposed to the same dish at partnering Joe Beef next door), spaghetti and about a pound of butter. It was good. Maybe not 55$ good. Service was ok, but it was late night and I felt the server was ready to go home.The music was great and the vibe was comfortable, we had a fun time."

The service and ambiance were fantastic and I love the decor, but everything we ate was far too salty. The starter salad arrived and looked gorgeous: a lovely piece of toasted brioche on top of a soufflé full of cheese, surrounded by tomatoes on top of kale: it would have been perfect if the kale hadn't of tasted like a mouthful of ocean :( In vain, we tried to cut down the salt with the bread and even that didn't work. Still, the tomatoes were incredible as was the brioche and soufflé. For my main, I had the dorade, it was stuffed with shrimp which tasted like overkill to me and took away from the freshness of the fish; the clams that surrounded it though were quite tasty. Dessert wasn't anything too special: meringue and ice cream. I will absolutely come back here for late night small bites, yummy beer and great wine, but for dinner, I'd rather go next door  to Joe Beef."
/user_details?userid=60l7Ng0_0BQp3LBB-iz15A,Olivia D.,"Annapolis, MD",4 star rating,"We came in just for a weekend trip and had a reservation for Friday night at 9:30. We walked from the Vieux Port area. It was a bit of a hike, on the long side, but doable. Even though we arrived a half hour early, we got seated right away. Thank God. Because the place was packed with barely even any room to even stand in the doorway and flag a staffer to check in. Like the other reviewers note, the menu is on a chalkboard on a wall. I was ready for that. I wasn't ready for the items to be in French. LawdhelpmeastereotypicalAmerican. Thankfully I could gather enough food words to know what most of the items were (like moules, poulet, spaghetti, and steak) but there were definitely a few where I just had no freaking clue. Also it felt awkward to be hovering over someone's table to stare at the chalkboard... and it was dark. I tried to take a picture but it wasn't coming out clear.So we sat at a table that was basically elbow to elbow with the tables next to us. Literally to get up and go to the bathroom, you have to push a table to the side otherwise your butt will end up in someone's drink/plate.Our server was more than happy to explain some of the menu items but also noted that things mostly change constantly so recommendations were pretty loosygoosy. The lobster spaghetti and steak are always on the menu -- but why order the things that are always on the menu when you can be more adventurous with whatever came in and inspired that day? Plus pasta is such a safe option, and safe = boring. So we got mussels as an appetizer . There were four mussels stuffed with ham, breading and other unidentifiable deliciousness on top of a bed of chunky salt. Really tasty.Then we ordered a whole arctic char stuffed with an array of mushrooms and spinach and accompanied by a luscious creamy sauce with dots of black caviar, with a side of steamed broccoli. It wasn't particularly pretty to look at, but my the flavors.... so delicious. The fish was cooked beautifully and the mushrooms and sauce all went together unexpectedly well. For dessert, we split the Paris Brest with chocolate and hazelnuts and pastry cream. It was alright. The choux pastry was denser and chewier than I expected, but you can't really go completely wrong with smothering pastry cream, chocolate and hazelnuts on anything. So overall, a fine fine meal and great experience."

In late at night from NY and (train) starved - about at the border I realized a nice tender lamb dish was something I needed, whatever it took. I texted my ride on running late and the plan was laid. Joe Beef. But that had a wait of 1.5 hours. Plan B (on J Beef recommendation  was next door to Liverpool House - same owners). No reservations in a packed house but a small table opened in 10 minutes and they got us in. Water: ordered carbonated bottled, my ride ordered glass of Grigo, and I a bottle of craft Wheat Caster ale. We ordered/shared a cold vegetable plate enhanced with some cockles and plenty of seasonal, slightly marinated radishes, spring potatoes, green beans, etc. We described what we had in mind to our waiter and narrowed the main courses down to sharing the lamb roast, a very large cut perfectly done with a raspberry relish accompaniment and pine nuts - served on a large platter swimming in juices and flavor, flavor, flavor. broiled cauliflower alongside. The lamb was probably the finest I can remember  enjoying--all expectations exceeded. As a side we made a valiant attempt at finishing a risotto dish. Did I say we trusted our waiter, a friendly and sufficiently attentive sort, on wine? I took him up on a French red to pair with the joint. The wine list is a challenge in the setting (dim, tight, boisterous with happy couples and parties) and almost inaccessible  above and behind a few of the cramped tables. We shared a pistachio pastry the next table recommended and what a treat it was - I had a cappuccino and took home almost half the lamb we'll serve as hors d'ourves tomorrow. This will be a hit. If you are worried about the cost, you ought not opt to dine here. It is expensive. Roast, two sides, dessert, 1 cappuccino, 2 glasses select wine, 1/2 litre beer and tip totaled approximately $240 CDN. I will be back again this Fall to follow the ever-changing menu where it will lead."

Located in the newly gentrified section of St Henri, the street it's on boasts a number of quaint restaurants, trendy shops and hipster bars. Our reservation was at 6:45 and when we arrived there were still a good number of unfilled seats. The crowd consisted of businessmen expensing the meal, locals and tourists alike. We were lucky enough to get seated at a four top in front of the chalkboard menu--lucky for us since there are no printed menus, the lighting is dim and my husband forgot his glasses. If you're somewhat unfamiliar w French use Google Translate, or even better just ask the waitstaff. Our server was polite and uber helpful as we apologized profusely for not speaking the native tongue.Undecisive, we went the tapas route (these are not tapas though, they're full-size). We started w a dozen PEI oysters, which were meticulously prepared and the freshest I've ever had. We also tried the beer cheese -- which I should've loved in theory bc I really enjoy each separately, but I just found it ok. The final app was the pork rilette, which I secretly didn't want to share.We followed it up with 3 entrees; beef cheek, which was beautifully tender, seared scallops and the most popular dish on the menu, lobster spaghetti in a light cream sauce. Sounds pretty simple, but if it ain't broke... Us broads, ever up for something sweet opted for the chocolate mousse. I typically opt for vanilla or nutty desserts, but this rocked.

SO GOOD. Started with oysters with vinagrette and old fashioned cocktails all around. The oysters were some of the best I've had. It was kind of nice not knowing their name, where they were from, just oysters. I ordered a second round; that good. We ordered a round of ""entrees,"" including a foie gras maple syrup petit dejeuner, fresh mozzarella on toast, and rigatoni. The foie gras dish left all all trying really hard not to lick the plate, so we actually borrowed toast from the mozzarella to mop up every last molecule on the plate. But the star of the night was the main plate I ordered, a steak with wine sauce and beer cheese cream. This was one of those dishes that stays with you, almost haunts you, for months. I'll never have this combination of flavors again in my life, so while I ate it I didn't really want it to end. A perfectly cooked piece of meat, placed in a red wine sauce with a sharp, bitter whipped beer cheese topping. Bitter, salty, sweet, juicy...it was unreal. We all tried each other's dishes, including lobster spaghetti, scallops, and trout, but nothing stood up to this piece of beef. The waiter was very good and very funny, describing horse meat the best way he could to three Americans not used to seeing it on menus. It's pretty loud, maybe not best for romance, but as a spot for a social evening, it's very fun. There's clearly some talent back in that kitchen, and if I make it back to Montreal, I'm heading here right from the airport...maybe after a stop at Dieu du Ciel!"

We each started with a mixed drink- expertly conceived and mixed by Chris the bartender. Bloody caesar, gin iced tea, bourbon sour, vodka martini- everything was delicious. For appetizers we loved the pate, the clam chowder, the lamb sausage, and the veal terrine. Everything that hit the table was perfect.

Even coming in with high expectations, Liverpool House was one of the best meals we've ever had.We speak very limited French and our waiter was incredibly patient and helpful talking us through a few suggestions based on the meal we were looking to have. He pointed us toward starting with oysters that were so fresh and delicious on their own that they needed no accompaniments despite a really tempting cocktail sauce on the table that begged to be added. An amazing artichoke crostini with a creamy cheese spread across the bread followed and disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. For our main course, we had the Liverpool Steak medium rare - 16 ounces of perfectly cooked meat that will be the standard to which all future steaks are judged. The lobster spaghetti was indulgent even by our standards but considering the plate was practically licked-clean we obviously had no regrets. We ended the meal with capuccinos and the only dish of the night that wouldn't qualify as a ""best thing I've ever eaten."" Maybe it was the copious amount of food we had already consumed but the Black Forest chocolate cake was forgettable. As for drinks, we made our way through the beers ""en fût"" with the American Pale Ale and the IPA really standing out, and just for good measure we went Canadian and had Bloody Caesars which also came with an oyster on top.  The service was outstanding, and throughout what turned into a three hour meal (!) the atmosphere fluctuated from lively and boisterous to lower-key and calmer while always managing to retain an intimate feeling throughout. Don't be fooled by any naysayers put off by the chalkboard - Liverpool House was an incredible meal and experience, and with food and service this good they could write the menu on folded origami paper in invisible ink for all I care!"

The atmosphere was excellent, but the food left something to be desired.There is no paper menu here - apparently, Montreal is really big on chalkboard menus that you must walk to in order to see what's available. No matter, we ordered three appetizers: brussel sprouts, rabbit nuggets, and mussels.  The brussel sprouts were good - very well cooked and seasoned, albeit a bit salty. The rabbit nuggets and the mussels left something to be desired: the mussels were VERY bready (maybe 3:1 ratio breadcrumbs to actual edible mussel), and the rabbit nuggets, while good, were mainly big cooked globs of bechamel sauce with a little rabbit inside.For dinner, we got the chicken and the hangar steak. The chicken was well seasoned, but difficult to eat. It had a gamey, homey feel - pleasant and comforting, but nothing special. The steak was very rare, and also very salty. Nothing remarkable.To finish, we had an apple bread pudding dessert. It was very good. The cocktails we had were also excellent.Overall, I would give the restaurant 3.5 stars - 3 stars for the food, and an extra half-star for the great staff, cocktails (the 'hard lemonade' - it's served in a mason jar - is the bomb). Don't be too bummed if you miss it during your visit to Montreal, there are so many delicious places to eat."

All of the dishes were bland--even by British standards.

The food, service and ambience was all amazing.  Chris was very knowledgeable about wine, recommended a nice bottle of Spanish red.  The menu is extensive and on the chalk board including their daily specials.  We started the meal with their asparagus and poached egg, and the shrimp salad, followed by the lobster pasta, which was much like Lobster Americana, and an order of beef brisket served with new potatoes and broccoli. We left after 9PM after two bottles of wine...The food is tasty, very rich and good sized portions.  I learned from Chris that you if are alone there's a good chance you can get a seat at the bar, since there are odd number of seats."

/user_details?userid=oMIHdktsahTp99l_j9ILeA,James E.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"If your desires include superb service, remarkable food, and a wonderfully playful and relaxed atmosphere, Liverpool House is your new favorite restaurant. The carnivorous food is an amazingly honest combination of Sadist Foie Gras Worship, Canadian Pride, unpretentious but exceptional execution deeply rooted world-class technique, Zero-F*#ks-Given Bacchanalian Outrageousness, and of course gilding of the lily where appropriate - caviar on the hollandaise sauce to go with the whole roasted, vegetable stuffed, bacon wrapped cod because ""why the f%*k not"" (-Chef Ari). It is basically a modern day Roman food orgy - but one prepared by a Jewish grandmother who is convinced her bubulas are too thin with crippling anxiety that there won't be enough food (but also one who went to the store voraciously hungry to shop and might have been a bit medicated  :) while menu planning. But joking aside, Chef Ari throws down harder than anybody I have met or heard of, period, end of story. You will not find a greater alter to worship the meat gods than at Father Ari's table.I was guided to The Liverpool House by the friendly folks at Joe Beef when planning a bachelor party for 10 people as Joe Beef didn't have the ability to seat a party larger than 7. Upon contacting Liverpool House, I spoke with the very friendly manager Chris, who explained that as a large party, I would have to go with a menu to be shared by the table which would be designed the week of our dinner. The price range was a totally reasonable $65-$85 per head. I explained to him that my crowd was going to be in town for a bachelor party and that we were the sort of folks who think that if one martini is good, 17 must be miles better. I also explained that we were all open to eating anything, but most importantly that we were generally mentally deranged gluttons who appreciate the long suffering of a goose to make our favorite food, The Foie Gras. He told me that we had definitely called the right people to satisfy the sorts of dark desires I described. As we were up from the U.S., I also requested that horse be on the menu, but otherwise I told him to leave it up to the chef.Here is some of what arrived at our table (including ALL the Foie Gras in the Western Hemisphere)1. 2 dozen oysters (my dining companions stupidly believed they needed more shellfish because they had no idea what else was in store - so we ordered 2 dozen more and some chilled Snow Crabs for good measure)2a. 3 plates of Bone marrow and chicken liver mouse served with pickled veggies and amazing bread2b. 3 plates of Local fresh mozzarella with more bomb-a$$ bread and pickled broccoli rabe3a. 3 plates of Horse tartare (absolutely stunning) 3b. Tasty and crispy Brussels Sprouts4. A WHOLE Roasted Foie Gras with (get this) cinnamon raisin buns and fig preserves. DUDE - you haven't lived until you have eaten slices of this stuff and then dipped a cinnamon bun into the pan of jus and goose-foie drippings. It gave me unclean thoughts I could never even begin to tell anyone. This stuff might sound simple, but trust me, roasting a whole foie without letting it melt and getting a crust on the outside requires an exceptional chef.Then - after the 5 rounds of appetizers, Chef Ari sends out the main course.5a. A whole roasted local Cod, deboned, stuffed with vegetables, and wrapped with bacon - the server brought it back to be carved. It reappeared on a large platter sliced into beautiful rounds with a selection of perfectly turned root veggies and some sauce boats of HOLLANDAISE TOPPED WITH CAVIAR - are you EFFing kidding me? I was taught at a young age (maybe 6) how to make proper hollandaise, and I promptly declared it the most noble sauce in the world, a magical elixir of butter, eggs and lemon which would make even the lowly New York City Subway grab handle appealing if it cam with a side of the stuff. Chef Ari made the best better. He improved Hollandaise Sauce. Wow. What a degenerate man. What a combination of genius and insanity. What a bloody innovator! You get the point..5b. A Rabbit, deboned, said stuffed with sausage. 5c. 2 Massive, sweetly fatty, deliciously charred, bone-in Rib Steaks, simply grilled, with one inch thick hunks of seared foie gras on top (an originally unplanned brilliant up-sell to my group). These also came with a wonderful salad of Endive, Cress and Blue Cheese dressing. 5d. 2 huge plates of his famous Lobster Pasta - YUM5e. Roasted squash5f. Simply Grilled Broccoli RabeAfter we has finished about 3/4 of it, (this group included 3 dudes in the 300lb range) I got up to ask the manager and waitstaff to plead for mercy during the desert course. 6a. Simple, moist, delicate pound cake with ice cream and pineapple6b. Clementine Sorbet topped with crumbled up poppy-seed astronaut ice cream6c. Chocolate mouse stuffed cookies with hazelnutsChef Ari is a well-intentioned Genius with a dark side of carnivorous glutton. Eat his food. Cheers, -James"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There are certain restaurants that just speak to us. Everything, from the decor to the ambience to the music and of course the food, works within your sensibilities and creates a space that would go gladly go back to day after day if you could because it just feels right. Fred Morin and Dave McMillan created just such a place for me with Joe Beef. Since my original visit there last year (and further reinforced by my recent meal there this summer), I have always had their second restaurant (and neighbour a few doors down) Liverpool House on my ""Must Check Out"" list. Well, I finally got the chance with the family to see if the Morin and McMillan spell on me would continue.With our 9:30 reservation and the dim lighting, there wasn't really the chance to take some interior pictures (and impacted the quality of my other pictures as well) but Liverpool House continues the casual and off-beat look that Joe Beef has in spades. Beautiful bar to enjoy a drink while a Steven Segal movie plays on a mini TV, wood panelled walls with large chalkboard menus, leather banquets and wood tables, a canoe on the ceiling, a mounted deer on the wall and way too many paintings of 18 wheelers. I simply cannot do it justice without images. All to say, I love it and the vibe it sets for the meal. Add some great alternative music and you've got me hook, line and sinker.Before we even discuss the food, we must start with the cocktails. Liverpool House has a few house cocktails and I got to try 2 over the course of the evening. First, the Old Pal - basically their twist on a Negroni. A very bitter cocktail but one that I enjoyed tremendously. The second one was called a St-Vincent Sour - their play on a Whiskey sour but using Bourbon and maple syrup instead. Love the overall balance of this cocktail - very smooth with a slight touch of sweet and no bitterness. Complete 180 to the Old Pal in every sense. I definitely will be playing with that combination of ingredients at home shortly.As a appetizer, I went with their ""Beer Cheese"" dish - a mixture of blue cheese, cream cheese and goat cheese with some beer and other spices which becomes a spread served with marinated vegetables and some grilled toast. A very solid cheese blend that balances itself quite nicely. The cream and goat cheeses lent a nice smooth creamy texture while the blue cheese added a bit of kick but not enough to overwhelm the other elements of the spread. The marinated vegetables added a little vinegar to the party and the deliciously toasted bread served as the perfect platter for all of this. A great appetizer.On to the main. I decided to go for the veal sweetbreads with a mix of onions and Romesco sauce. Served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and some jus, this dish will make anyone who has issues with sweetbreads love them. Nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect soft and fluffy texture inside, the sweetbreads were cooked to perfection to truly showcase the natural fattyness they hold. The mixture of onions added some nice sweetness to the dish and the Romesco sauce (a Spanish nut and red pepper-based sauce for the un-initiated as I was that night) provided a little garlic kick and as well as a little sweet spiciness. This dish was returned completely picked clean - loved every inch of it.There was one other main course I tried as there was some leftovers at the table and that was the curry shrimps.  The reason for some being left over is quite simple - the portion they serve is huge. Over a dozen large shrimp served in a curry mixture with spicy lentils, pilaf rice and a yogourt sauce. The sauce for the shrimp was nice and mild in terms of curry. I cannot say the same for the lentils - a little too much heat for my tastes, especially the after-taste. Thankfully the deliciously creamy yogourt sauce cooled my palette off quickly. Add a solid rice pilaf and you have a solid dish through and through.Finally we get to dessert. I went for the Apricot Financiers. Mini light and fluffy almond flour-based cakes with a hazelnut crust served with some cherries, apricots and house-made vanilla ice cream. Wonderfully executed dessert all around. I was a big fan in particular of the ice cream. Just a great depth of vanilla flavour on top of a velvety texture. A great end to a awesome meal.In the end, Liverpool House had me from the moment I walked in and never let go. The entire experience was wonderful and simply made wish I could come back more often (and believe me... if it weren't for budgetary notions, I would be there and at Joe Beef pretty much monthly). If you have been to Joe Beef and enjoyed it, then you need to check out Liverpool House. If you haven't been, then no worries. Just come down anyway and I am sure you will convert quite quickly. Now to go save more money to visit again soon....Cheers!"

It really was a great experience and probably the highlight of our trip to Montreal. The food is just fantastic. I went with the most popular (and expensive!!!) dish, lobster spaghetti and have zero regrets! Seriously we've paid less to feed our family of four dining out than we did on that one dish, but man we were on vacation so who cares, right? It was so worth it. I'm already trying to figure out how to recreate that meal at home! My partner got the rabbit, also very delicious!! Highly recommended. He was so happy. The waitstaff and service is wonderful. They walked us through the menu, checked in constantly, refilled our water before they were empty, even brushed crumbs away in between courses. We had a few beers each and enjoyed the 90's hip hop. Totally our kind of place. Would and WILL go back every time we visit."

The ingredients seemed to have a more Italian influence, but the fresh chalk-board format written in French and the overall feel were the same. You can see my Joe Beef review here: yelp.com/biz/joe-beef-mo…, my boyfriend and I went to Joe Beef the night before Liverpool house.We came into Liverpool House with a strategy, ordering much lighter appetizers than the previous night: clams casino and tripe. My boyfriend had never had tripe before, and I had bad memories of a chewy substance in tomato sauce, but this was not the case at Liverpool House. The tripe was melt-in-your mouth good, and the sauce was so flavorful. A definite favorite and all the couples around us ordered it after seeing ours come out of the kitchen!For dinner we thought we were being savvy ordering the lamb for two, in light of the overwhelming portions at Joe Beef the night before. Boy, were we wrong. What emerged from the kitchen could have easily fed a family of four. The meat was tender and perfect, and it came with a large dish of seasonal veggies. We finished the meal with some sweet sorbet, and ran off to some nearby bars to wash it all down.Pro tip: try the Joe Beef Pilsner, very crisp and refreshing, and only available at Joe Beef, Liverpool House and a couple of other local spots."

Fortunately for us I was able to secure a late-night reservation at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.We were among one of the last tables of the evening, the service was casual yet impeccable.  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about both the food and wine choices.  Our sever patiently explained each menu item (menu = in french on a chalkboard) to our 6-top table of tied conference-drunk women with ADHD.  When some of us ordered Oysters on the half shell our waitress graciously brought extra (as one of the amuse items) so that everyone at the table might try some. For an appetizer we consumed a foie gras sandwich nestled between a freshly baked  ""English Muffin""  topped with house-cured bacon and local Artisan cheese then drizzled in local Canadian Maple Syrup.   Perhaps one of the best things we've ever eaten (unanimous on this nomination among this group of dining ladies).  Later, in celebration of our foie gras ""high"" the staff let us dance on an adjacent table as celebration  (note, they joined in the festivities).I pretty much wanted to come here on every remaining night in Montreal or at least try to squeeze a seat for dinner at the bar at Joe Beef.   I will probably brave Montreal in the winter months an have a culinary vacation based on this dinner.  Eat here, just do it, it's awesome !!"

/user_details?userid=foC7W9iCzvopo9LVLFAvqg,Don S.,"Minneapolis, MN",3 star rating,"This is the hardest review I've written, because there are so many factors playing into the experience at Liverpool House. I'll start with the food, which was good. I began with fried zucchini flowers that were stuffed with paneer and peas. They were coated in a garbanzo bean batter and fried to golden perfection. The flavors, including the accompanying sauce, were delicate and delicious - a nice kick of toasted coriander seed among them. My partner started with the short ribs in curry, and they were also very good - tender and flavorful. For mains, I had the salmon with lentils, recommended by our server, and my partner had the dorade stuffed with shrimp and served with clams. These were both flavorful, and my salmon had a surprising and nice crust, but it was extremely salty. Same of the dorade, though the clams were delicious.So far, so good. The ambience is relaxed as well and very welcoming. I felt a little sorry for the party that was seated below the menu board since they were among the first in the place and had to suffer through every other diner hovering over their table to decide what to order (they don't provide menus at table - fine, and hey, kudos for saving trees when the menu changes daily - but odd for those at table beneath it).The staff is great. They echo the atmosphere of the place, very easygoing, yet attentive and helpful. One server gave us a couple other recommendations for spots in Montreal, which was really kind.The price was quite steep. My salmon with lentils was over $30. It was a warm day and we decided to have a bottle of white wine, and there was nothing on offer below $40...and the price rose to $75 pretty steeply from there. Which seems incongruous with the vibe of the place and many of the dishes on offer.The menu overall felt a little disjointed, with some items influenced by this spot's chef, who is from Pakistan, and other items like foie gras with brioche that are more traditionally associated with the Joe Beef guys, who also run Liverpool House. I get the British-Pakistani influence, but somehow it all seemed a little more experimental than cohesive.Lastly, and probably a key to the whole experience - Liverpool House is next door to Joe Beef, which is where we originally hoped to get a reservation, but which is booked a month out, we learned. And we were guided to Liverpool House, as are no doubt many others. But they have little in common besides ownership and maybe vibe. So it feels a bit like the poor cousin there to scoop up those who don't plan far enough ahead. Why they didn't just expand Joe Beef instead, I'm not sure - maybe it's about food sourcing or some other capacity issue. In general, it's easy to want to cheer for these guys. But I would say, if you want to go to Joe Beef and can't get in, there are better substitutes at a better price in Montreal than Liverpool House."

The combination of bacon, runny egg and foie was absolutely perfect. For main course we shared the Liverpool steak and their famous lobster spaghetti. The steak was just ok, maybe it was the cut but was a bit fibrous. The lobster spaghetti was what spectacular like all other reviews attested to.

I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms, but the potatoes were nice. The horse burger came with potato and mushrooms, but (both) lacked in any real vegetables.A warning, you get a _lot_ of food.

The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.I wish I could dine here every single night- yes. It was that good.

This is something I haven't seen done before, and even though it's only a little thing, it makes a big difference to the experience.The menu itself was interesting, and obviously changes regularly. We started with squid stuffed with lobster - it was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The seafood here seems to be taken seriously, so I would recommend trying it when coming (I saw someone else eating the oyster plate, and had instant meal-envy). I had the ribs as my main, and they lived up to expectations - the meat was cooked spot-on, the sauce good and thick, and plenty of chips. I didn't expect to have such a meal at a 'gourmet' establishment, but I definitely enjoyed it.For the dessert we had homemade doughnuts and a chocolate brownie. Both were really good (the doughnuts reminded me of Aussie doughnuts - lots of cinnamon), but I think the brownie was the winner.The place itself is warm and cosy, and makes a great 'date venue.' It isn't cheap, but you do get quality service, food, and good atmosphere (if you want cheap, there's a Dilallo Burger down the road!)."

/user_details?userid=yaZ4sHRanrbH_Ukb07Dl5g,Doug B.,"Little Rock, AR",4 star rating,"Liverpool House serves some terrific food.  Definitely the best fois gras I've had in Montreal.  Beware though, it is a large size for 2 people, probably best for 4 as it is so rich and heavy.   Wine list was terrific.  I have the rabbit korma which seemed a bit off the wall for a restaurant like Liverpool, but it was quite delicious.  I've had my fair share of Indian food and I thought it had some very intense and authentic Indian flavors.  And the rabbit was extremely well prepared and tender.  I haven't been to Joe Beef yet, but this was really really good.I docked a start for two reasons.  The first is really minor, and not really a complaint at all, but the menu was in French and had to be translated by our server.  I don't mind because I'm a visitor in their town and restaurant, but it was very busy and the server didn't really have the time to properly translate.  This limited my confidence in ordering a few dishes that I just wasn't sure about from her brief description.  The second issue was unfortunate as the seating is cramped and we were sat next to a really, really drunk and really loud group of people.  Our server was apologetic, but it ruined the experience to some degree.  Perhaps not their fault, but I'm reviewing my experience.  Would certainly go back, although we'll probably try Joe Beef next time for a different experience.  Liverpool is definitely worth the trip."

We started with a mix of oysters which were some of the freshest i have had. We then ordered the rabbit croquettes and horse meat tartare which were both delicious. I then ordered the lobster spaghetti which was not bad the lobster was great although i was expecting more from the spaghetti and the sauce. The serive was great and overall it was a great dinner. With drinks this all came to about $100 pp.
/user_details?userid=zzgb9L3NBT9V8BGw_DcVYw,Belle D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"High end food + rustic chic décor + blackboard menu + small room + dim lighting = a successful formula. Many of Montreal's most successful and trendy restaurants follow this precise code - think Garde Manger, Joe Beef, Bremner, Club Chasse et Pêche, L'Orignal and yes, Liverpool House.Don't get me wrong - I love the formula. Just because something becomes popular doesn't mean it should be dissed. I'm not that kind of person. I love Britney Spears.Liverpool House was one of the few restaurants that began this trend in Montreal. Clearly, it did so successfully. One of the best things about these ""rustic chic"" places is that they re quite casual but still focused on the haute, and that they welcome a certain ""older"" crowd. You know wont be annoyed by loud 19-year olds fête-ing their unfortunate halter-top wearing friend's birthday because of the slightly higher price point. Liverpool House, thank you for existing.There's something undeniably charming about walking into a small space where RSVP's are difficult to come by, being welcomed as if you were entering a friend's Hamptons' home, and sitting down at an unpretentious wooden table set with a plaid serviette. The blackboards and framed pictures adorning the walls just add to the atmosphere, and the soft lighting makes the good-looking people this place attract even better looking. Really? Yeeeah, really.I loved everything that contributed to my experience at Liverpool House. Our waiter was supernice and supercute, knew the (new!) menu well, and timed the services perfectly. My friend and I split the braised lamb cavatelli ($11) to start. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the lamb was soft and very flavourful.Next, we had the infamous lobster spaghetti with bacon and tomato sauce ($49) and the scallops with braised pork belly, lentils and fried egg ($34). Both were insane. The spaghetti had huge chunks of lobster (way more than you would think) and a slightly smoky flavour from the bacon. It was a huge portion, enough for two actually.The scallops were some of the best I've ever had. Overcooked scallops are an obvious faux-pas, but I also really dislike undercooked scallops. In my opinion, they should be raw (tartar, ceviche) or cooked (pan seared, grilled) - none of that awkward middle ground that results in a warm but raw mess on your plate. Liverpool House's scallops were incredibly tender and cooked to the perfect point - not the least bit chewy. The pork belly was as delicious as ever, and the egg and spiced lentil puree brought everything together beautifully. Sounds weird, but it was flawless.We decided to finish our meal with the House's parfait ($11). Real crème fouettée, caramelized apples and white sponge cake in a jar, topped with caramelized pecans. Sounds unspectacular, but each part of the dessert had a finesse to it. It really was delicious. My dessert fiend friend was floored. (Tongue twister, anyone?)And finally, let me address one last thing that I've heard mentioned too many times. Many say Liverpool House is pretentious and has a too-cool-for-school attitude, but I really don't think so. I think that those who call it pretentious are the ones who weren't prepared for the restaurant's price point (even though it's totally justified by the quality of its dishes) or those who tend to feel self-conscious in trendy places. Yes, this place is ""hot"", but everything about it lives up to the hype. So relax and take pleasure in its unaffected vibe. Don't overthink things. Just go and enjoy... It's a foodie must.Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere (cozybutverylively) 9/10, Pretty people 9/10, Music 9/10, Service 9.5/10.Pictures: belledenuitmontreal.com/…"

The blackboard menu was a kind of cool tre-shiek touch, but unfortunately as a dumb American, I don't speak French. However, Suzzanne was helpful to figure out the menu and made some great recommendations.I also went to Garden Manger and thought that was better than this place, but overall, would definitely recommend this place."

My impressions are : 1- Squeezing challengeI had to squeeze my way through everything in this restaurant starting from hanging your coat (which was the first hurdle I faced after entering the place- to support my coat over 30 other garments on a hanger that is overly packed to) then to squeeze my entire body through a table of two men (who did not think for a moment out of courtesy to mover their bodies or perhaps elbows for me to get into my seat- and obviously the host did not bother to move the table in or out for me to walk in freely- I had to utilize my acrobatic skills in front if my date which was not classy) 2- Eye sight challengeI was asked by the host to stand in front of a blackboard under very dimmed light to check out the menu (because they have no paper menus and the waiter refused to mention what they have in terms of food initially) So again I had to squeeze out from my premium seat and stand in front of a wall with other fellow dinners and try to understand the French writing !!! In smaller than 10 font size with very little light I have been to restaurants that have this kind of blackboard menus (pubs and trendy restaurants) but in all places I have tried, there is always a) a paper form of menub) some sort of well lit blackboard with medium size font c) fewer choices of food !! After failing to read the extensive menu at Liverpool House I asked the waitress for help- she instructed that I have to look at the board I replied that I did but my eye sight is very bad and I did not want to wear my reading glasses in front of my date !!(obviously this date did not call again) She suggested the fish which was nice But again I wanted to try the wine ( which again was written on a separate board) but realized it is going to be hard to leave my seat , attempt to read, Order and drink, and then try to go to the toilet !! I adopted the strategy of not moving from my seat till I leave .. Not sure why this restaurant is popular but again I will give it another try in day light - this could never happen actually as they only open for dinner!!"

/user_details?userid=a3gKHarQcY61pZ9B6Ob5fg,Tanya G.,"Nashville, TN",3 star rating,Nice atmosphere but this is one of those restaurants that squeeze tables together to maximize the number of seats. You end up being uncomfortably close to strangers sitting an elbow length away. You can't even get out from your seat without moving the table which is a real issue since the only menu they have is a chalkboard on the far wall of the restaurant. The food was very mediocre and overpriced. What I DID love were the oysters. Fresh and delicious. I fail to see what all the hype is about and wouldn't go back.

/user_details?userid=rEmo4D_qdlKQz7egfnUeJQ,Reggie S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Reservations are a must at this place and even then be prepared to wait. Even with 9:30pm reservations we weren't seated until about 10pm. The host did provide us with drinks while we waited which is a nice way to bide our time. Why the 5 stars still? Because the food and service were still damn good. Plus, while waiting for our table I was able to read over the chalkboard menu in the main dining room. The food was amazing and the staff were very attentive and helpful. Started with a parfait of fois gras and deep fried Brussels sprouts as appetizers. The sprouts are tossed in a vinaigrette which really brightens up their nutty flavor. The fois gras was served in a small mason jar and served with triangles of bread. The stars of the evening were the entrees. Not sure if they're meant to be eaten 'family style' but the portions lend themselves to sharing with your table. We ended up getting the spaghetti lobster and sirloin steak - surf and turf! These apparently are permanent fixtures on their rotating menu and I can see why. If you only plan to visit this fine establishment once in your life, do yourself a favor and get the spaghetti lobster. If that was the only dish I tried that evening there then I honestly would have left completely satisfied. As soon as the dish hit the table we were hit with the aroma of lobster and butter. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. If I could, I would've licked the plate clean to get all that delicious sauce. The steak was cooked exactly to medium and the kitchen sliced it for us to make it much easier to share. They also sent out a side of lentils with roasted squash on the house to accompany our other dishes.The final tab for dinner for two with drinks but without desserts because we were completely stuffed from dinner, came out to a little over $100/person. The place is loud, cramped and tiny, but all totally worth it if you're looking to have an amazing dinner. Be aware they do not accept Amex."

The people aren't polite, they are authentically pleasant. Saimi, our waitress, looked like she stepped out of one of those D&G ads for light blue, which i assumed would mean attitude galore. But her demeanor was so freaking awesome, she eventually picked out our menu for the evening and put us onto Olive & Gourmando for brunch the next day (a super awesome choice) as well as recommendations for nuit blanche, which we were visiting for anyway.The host, equally awesome, his name escapes me, served us drinks and was super accommodating. I wouldn't say the place is good for kids, but they didn't turn their nose up once to us having our seven year old in tow, the opposite is usually true.The food was good. The menus are on the wall and change constantly. I gave up early and simply asked for recommendations, and every dish was enjoyed. Again, they serve a solid menu, offer a strong wine selection but the service was the stand out, and was simply excellent, and that's saying a lot."
/user_details?userid=wYXO7Lq6CBCyLqnihG-VIw,Bryce N.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Several thoughts after dining at Liverpool House because I could not get a reservation at Joe Beef:- It was your typical Saturday evening for a popular restaurant such as this; busy crowd of people looking for a good dinner in nice setting.  I had come to the Liverpool House with my companion after not being able to get a reservation/drop in spot at the bar at Joe Beef next door.  We were recommended by the Joe Beef hostess to try Liverpool House since they do not accept reservations.  - After walking into Liverpool House the man responsible for greeting and seating guests was kind enough to find seating for my companion and myself within 10 minutes after first questioning why we didn't have a reservation.  We were told we would need to order, eat and be out within the hour becuase the table was needed for a reservation, although, as the our time at Liverpool House dragged on it was 40 minutes before our waiter even took our order and there seemed to be multiple tables opening up all ove the restaurant.  (I still have not been able to get a straight answer from anyone working at Liverpool House whether reservations are accepted or required) - My companion and I ordered wine and beers by the glass.  The options are not abundant but they are unique.  There is an extensive list of wines if you choose to order it by the bottle but I would have liked to see some additional beer selections across a broader spectrum since those offered by Liverpool House were reasonably similar in taste.- The menu is written on a chalk board, paper menus are not provided.  You are expected to make your selections from here which can cause for an awkward moment when you will be standing next to one of the tables that sit directly under them.  Do not be surprised if you receive some annoyed stares from the patrons sitting at these tables if you need to hover near them as you read the menu.- My companion and I were seated in a position that was obstructed from viewing the menu options.  I have a reasonable grasp of French and am able to get by quite well, especially at a restaurant, but my companion did not speak the language.  Consequently, I was able to read the majority of the menu offerings but we had also asked the waiter for his recommendations after having told him which menu options we had been considering.  Instead of the menu options we picked out he suggested we order the lamb, a Liverpool House speciality, instead of ordering 2-3 plates to share between us.  The lamb was NOT listed on the menu under the ""Plates"" portion of the menu but we decided to take his recommendation as well as oder the tomato salad as an appatizer. -  The tomato salad was just as good as some of the best I have ever had.  The lamb was expertly prepared and the accompanying sides of steamed seasonal vegetables were equally as good.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh.  - I will admit, the lamb was HUGE.  There was enough meat to easily feed hungry 3-4 people, far more than the serving for two it is advertised as and we were lucky to have eaten half of this.  We had wished that our waiter had accurately described just how much meat would be part of the meal becuase we would have stuck with our original plate selections.- My less than stellar rating comes from the service provide by our waiter.  After seeing the size of our meal we had the discomforting feeling of having been upsold on the lamb and that our waiter had taken advantage of my less than perfect masterly of the French langugae and my companions complete lack of knowledge of the langugae.   When we told him this we during our meal he protested in the middle of the restaurant trying to justify his suggestion as being no different in size or cost than us having ordered two plates; one each.  For us, the cost was not the issue, more rather tha we felt he took advantage tof the lanuage barrier to upsell us on the most expensive menu offering that was clearly too large for the two of us.  Further, the lamb was listed under the Desserts on the menu, far away from the listing of Plates where we had been looking - which had been communicated to him.  We both found his behaviour to be both awkward and rude as he continued to protest and argue while patrons from other tables began to stare, making for a more than awkward remainder of the meal until oour eventual exit from the restaurant. Final thoughts; the food was excellent but the service of our waiter was terrible making for a sour note on the evening and will discourage me from ever returning to Liverpool House.  I will plan to share my experience with my friends and others in the hope that they will take note and either avoid Liverpool House or be better prepared."

We called early in the evening and while they said they were completely booked, they told us to come down and they'd squeeze us in, which they did, three minutes after we walked in the door.The service was excellent,. Jean-Phillipe was very polite, attentive, and he made us feel immediately at home from the second he stepped to our table. We explained that we couldn't read the menu, which was entirely in french, so he did us the favor of describing some of the appetizers for us. He'd periodically check in on us throughout the evening, usually to gauge our reactions to the food, which were a mix of ravings and silence, due to being completely at a loss for words.The food was incredible. Not even joking, it was the best meal I can remember having... ever. We started with the brussel sprouts which blew my mind. I'd never had them quite like this. I believe they fried them in beef fat, and dressed them with a cider/honey/hotsauce concoction that was absolutely perfect. Oh and the mussels. Not too briny, fresh and delicious.Horse filet. I never ever thought in a million years I'd eat horse, but I did, and it was amazing. Very similar to beef, but slightly more tender, and just as, if not more delicious.The lobster pasta plate was huge and the pasta perfectly cooked. Creamy sauce with so much lobster. The two of us barely dented it, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.We finished the meal off with the sticky toffee pudding. I'm a big dessert eater, and my date isn't, but she raced me to the last bite.All in all, it was a wonderful experience and after I got up from the table, I wanted to walk into the kitchen and open mouth kiss the chef so he could taste everything I just did.Thank you Jean-Phillipe and everyone at the Liverpool House, next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to come by."

And the main entree composed of three small filets of horse meat covered with a special brown sauce. And to end, the pound cake.Service was very good, staff friendly, and a hip atmosphere right next to their big brother joe beef.

We had some amazing oysters, but I will have to say the highlight of the meal was asparagus with shrimp and Béarnaise sauce!  For our main courses we went with Sea Bream and Clams, and Duck dishes. They were good just not as good as our appetizers (we could have ate that the whole night away).

/user_details?userid=d1G6qV4v2RT2o8v27anr2w,John Paul T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Liverpool House is a real treat to visit. Owned by the same proprietors of Joe Beef, Liverpool House follows the same tried and true formula: a distinctly Canadian decor--canoes, moose memorabilia, and a woodsy motif with a touch of industrial, mid-century modern-a chalkboard menu, bubbly waitstaff, and freshly prepared food. I have never had anything even remotely bad to eat here and I've always left LH satisfied beyond compare.Liverpool House has much more of an emphasis on seafood than its distinctly 'beefy' Joe Beef counterpart. In fact, the most treasured dish on the menu is the Lobster spaghetti which, while pricey ($50 for the entree), is incredibly tasty and chalked full of significantly sized lobster pieces that have been marinated in a cream-based sauce that can only be described as orgasmic. Sex for the mouth, er, sex for the taste buds is more like it! I also had--albeit a few months ago now--the best salad I have ever had in my life at Liverpool House. It was called the 'salade d'hiver,' which is why I question if it is available all year 'round. But this salad was the freshest, fluffiest, and most satisfying salad I've ever had. period. And I don't 'do' salad. Liverpool is also one of the best spots for oysters west of Le Bremner. The oysters are 'fresh to death,' quite literally, and will impress even the most demanding palate. Now this might just be me but I always find myself making friends with my fellow diners. The cozy environment--and the liberal pours of the waitstaff--makes for an incredibly social dining experience. Les Montrealais and tourists alike will find themselves at home amidst foodies and diners who appreciate some of the best quality foodstuffs in Montreal (and Canada, for that matter). Allez. You must, if you're from out of town as this is a truly authentic Canadian dining experience. But be forewarned, the reason this review is not five stars is because the bills at up quickly at this joint and you'll be hard-pressed to leave without a tab around $150/pp if you order an appetizer, an entree, and a glass of wine."
/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Dear Foodies,We need to talk. I am fed up, really FED UP about these star chefs in Montreal getting all this glory and the royal treatment for cooking homefood. If I want to eat homefood, I'll cook at home and will probably do better work of it that these guys.This brings me to Liverpool House. So loved and adored, even Anthony Bourdain gushes like a tingly teenage girl at a Justin Bieber concert over the chef at Liverpool House. But I have only one question about that.... WHY?The restaurant looks pretty cool and homey, a place where you feel comfortable burning away the time, boozing and eating. There is no menu; the writing is on the wall... literally ON THE WALL. The quality of service is impeccable. The place as a whole is very welcoming, except for the noise, lotsa noise. Even if we removed the table next to us, populated by none other than Liberal MP Justin Trudeau, his lovely wife and his posse screaming and laughing like annoying 14 year olds at a McDonald's it would still be extremely noisy. But seriously this is about the food right? Yeah about that.They have a decent menu considering the menu gets an once-over pretty regularly. As starters there was Oysters, Fried Pig Tails, Rabbit sausage and over course the ubiquitous Foie Gras plate. I had the Foie Gras of course. As a voracious Foie Gras eater, I can't resist the offering when it emerges. Foie Gras is a complicated love affair. It can make or break the whole experience, the better the execution, the further downhill the experience can go. And this was no exception. The chef basically re-invented the Egg McMuffin with Sausage using high end ingredients. I was offered a breakfast sammich made of some bread, firm and unyielding, some aged cheddar (me thinks) and Foie Gras... a big tasty, fatty, delicious pile of Foie Gras drizzled with Maple Syrup, topped with a perfectly fried egg. Cutting through it, releasing the egg yolk, mixing with the maple syrup, the fatty goodness of the foie gras... made for what was likely the greatest execution of a foie gras dish I have ever tasted. It was close-your-eyes-tilt-your-head-back-and-going-hmmmmmm good. And once done I gave up all decorum and fingered the remaining goo of yolk, maple syrup and fat off my plate. Then came the main. How the mighty have fallen. All the dishes ordered looked less than ordinary. The fish, the lobster spag, the ribs and even my plate of rabit and risotto. I find that rabbit is best served braised. To roast a bunny is to take many chances of it being dry... and dry it was. Dry enough for me to gulp down 4 glasses of water in a row. Was it good? Yeah but way freaking dry. I had to stop eating it. But that was just adding insult to injury. Let's talk risotto. The way I understand it, risotto is to be a creamy rich unctuous rice affair. The rice should be a starchy rice, a heavy rice, not a jasmine rice and oh did I mention creamy, rich and unctuous? This risotto was none of that. The frame of reference I'm talking here is Uncle Ben's precooked instant rice meals you get out of a plastic pouch which you nuke in the microwave. There were no ingredients that I could identify here that belonged in a risotto, I mean even the rice was wrong. I've never made a risotto myself but I bet I could have executed one with far greater success. The whole dish was an epic and massive failure.The dessert, a sticky apple bread pudding thingie, was a thorough success in sugary goodness. But again, apples, maple syrup and some lemony sorbet... total win. But it was insufficient to buy back my good favors after the atrocious travesty of a risotto - an Italian would have screamed bloody murder and that dry choke-you preparation of the rabbit was unforgivable. This is especially egregious when a bistro like Via Crescent braises its bunny overnight in a ragout of carrots and celeries and sells it to you for half the price and yet never fails."

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal and possibly one of the more under-appreciated if considering quality of food and nice atmosphere. This is what I've grown to refer to as a ""Chalkboard Bistro"". The menu is provided on a single large chalkboard hung on the wall, written in chalk. While I'm not a big fan of this practice, the menu at Liverpool House offers an excellent range or options (not limiting but also not overwhelming) making decisions a bit difficult and leading to a repeat visit! Everything I've had here has been very good to excellent but the Lobster Spaghetti was AMAZING...one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten. Atmosphere is casual / comfortable, the staff very friendly, knowledgable and helpful."

/user_details?userid=gPK2AKr-UA_7hZus80SSng,Kat T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"From the owner of Joe Beef, a restaurant where those not-so-adventurous foodies can eat. Liverpool House has a rotating menu, so many reviews have mentioned specific dishes that were nowhere on the menu. However, I will mention what was on the menu yesterday when I snagged an awesome last-minute table. There is one main dining room and the bar area- totally decked out in Canadiana- deer antlers and row boat oars. Great artwook on the walls. We sat in front of the dinner menu and throughout people had to come stand near us to take a look at the options du jour.  This could be a great way to meet some new friends!Service was great in french and english explaining all the wacky dishes and preparations. They also aren`t bad for the eyes...Entrees range from $9-20 and run the gamut from Huitres (oysters) to steak taco. I tried the gnocci, as I try to do at any place that serves this dish.  It was creamy and soft- obviously made within the day.  Plats (main dishes) run from $25-50 for the lobster spaghetti, which I saw and it has pretty much a whole lobster on top!  Most are in the $30 range. Of the fish options, artic char or doré, I opted for the char with a `crust`of shrimp. Awe-inspiring and tasty. This had to be the biggest peice of char I have ever seen, and the smallest plate at my table.  The pintade (guinea fowl) was served on a platter and was the size of half a chicken. The rabbit could have served two, but my SO managed to finish it off!  No room for dessert, which is maybe why they only have 3 options. No matter, they all looked good. The drink selection is great which wine by the glass and a whole other wall-sized chalk board to review the wines by the bottle.  At the end of the meal, I stepped to the other side of the table to the hallway labeled, `pipi room`. After a bloody ceasar (served with oyster on top) and one glass of wine left me giggling all the way home."

We were a group of 3, and unfortunately, the restaurant decided that we deserved to be squeezed in to a table for 2 by putting an extra chair at the table. We had to move the table to wedge into our seats, and then realized that one of us was sitting directly over a cold vent. Who wants cold air blowing up their crotch for an entire meal? Not us. so we asked to move. We were moved to the table right next to the front door, where we sat on the most uncomfortable bench for the next 2 hours. No cushions, nothing to lean against, just a terrible place to sit for 2 hours.Which is unfortunate, since the meal was so delicious! Had the shrimp and polenta and eggplant and mozzarella to start. They were both great! The shrimp came with a lobster gravy that was amazing, could have had it to drink. For our mains we shared the onglet and the lobster spaghetti. Both were great, especially the lobster. We ordered the bread to soak up the extra sauce, which was the best part of the entire meal. For dessert we had the black forest cake (not so good) and the almond cake (pretty good).Overall, the meal was great, but it was disappointing to be seated so poorly. When making a reservation next time I would specify where I wanted to sit. I would suggest the same for anyone reading this."

We had reservation for 6 and arrived promptly, we were escorted to our table and got a brief explanation of what to expect. Our waitress arrived shortly and observed our crooked faces looking at a chalkboard with the daily menu written in French. After getting our wine and beers she explained each starter in elegant detail and took the time to clarify when needed. We order a few items family style, her recommendation, and enjoyed each one. My younger brother took the lead on ordering BC he is the foodie in the family and knows best. We had oysters that were almost sweet, foi gras ( I think) which was surprisingly delicious and we each had a bite and we had the beer cheese bread. All starters had good portions and tasted wonderful. I ordered the trout ( served in all it's glory) and even though m wife want a tail and head kinda gal she even tasted it. It was cooked perfectly and served with capers, peas and a delicious sauce. My brother ordered a sirloin and it was the biggest chunk of happiness I have seen in a good while, it was served with broccoli and some type of cheese. Besides him ordering it med well it was delicious! His wife and mine shared the lobster pasta and it was enough for each. Served with an entire lobster on top they were super nice about splitting it up. Our waitress took the time to explain th 20 something menu items in such great detail, answered all our tourist questions and even suggested a few other places to stop. I would love to return but there are so many great places to try in this town. Thank you Liverpool house, ps can you get us into joe beef before Saturday?"

It was a bit loud of an environment for my grandmother but since she can't really hear even in a quiet spot, it didn't really affect the awesome meal we had. Everything we ate was spectacular - beginning with oysters and burrata. I picked off of everyone's entrees but got the pakora appetizer as my main. Since I tried everything, I decided I was going to rate everyone's dishes and decide who's was best... well - that ended up being quite the difficult task considering everything tasted so great. If I had to pick, it was the pasta dish with lobster that my aunt and cousin shared. We had dessert and wine which were both really good. Everyone left very satisfied - including my grandmother. It was a bit pricey ($600 bill) but we decided it was totally worth it. Our server was also very sweet and helpful - although she did forget to split the bill and bring it to my sister who requested it at the beginning of the meal."
