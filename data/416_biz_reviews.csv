/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"To have the restaurant a 5/5 especially during this time of Covid, for excellent and attentive service, orignal food and delicious cocktails. Our server Vincent was a star!! Best service I've had since Covid, attentive, kind, chatty and took good care of us and it made our evening. The cheese and charcuterie is a most, considering that the charcuterie are made I house. Let me tell you the prosciutto was tender. The main dishes to the braised leeks and the duck tartare was light and flavourful. We ordered a rancid I, but they were ok, sauce was missing a little depth. That said, ambiance and decor is incredibly inviting and the spacing is adequate. Very clean and cozy. Highly recommend for a girls night or night out with your significant other :)"

Drinks are amazing, the food was also delicious and our waitress Channel's wine recommendation skills were on point. They also did a great job separating tables while not letting the restaurant look sparse, or ruining their amazing ambience."

I've been 3 times and here was my overall experience. Prior to this day, I attended a foodie event which allowed us to try their entire menu. Perles et Paddock definitely knew how to blow my mind. But unfortunately my third visit didn't quite reflect what I had experienced in the past.Beautifully designed restaurant- very OC/LA vibe but if you are looking for the perfect fried chicken, this ain't the place. The chicken and waffle was looking rather thin and flimsy- really missing that wow factor and really not what I had experienced before. The one I had previously was bigger and this one was kinda looking a little sad ($26). You're better off going to Popeyes or Mon Ami (Korean fried chicken. Go to the Somerled location).We also ordered the steak and egg chimichurri which unfortunately did not reflect its price point ($22). The steak wasn't tender. The dish that stole my heart out of all three was the sweet potato pancakes. Very savoury but I would recommend to add more caramelized pecans. ($16)Perles et Paddock is beautiful place, great for quick bite and cocktails with A+ service. The service that I received from A to Z was outstanding. But don't expect to be mind blown for their food. Great for cocktails though!"

No ""main meals"" served at this restaurant, all dishes are appetizer/tapas style. The waiter suggested 3-4 dishes per person. If you are 4 people you can take the entire menu and share all plates. Haddock was bland. Shrimp were good. Leak plate is not a good choice. We all liked the spaetzle. Drinks and wine are nice. Problem is that some of us left hungry! Be prepared to spend a significant amount. My favourite part was the decor. Enjoy!"

The decor is bright, organic and green... makes you feel good on a sunny summer Sunday. The food is delicious and fresh, and coffees are well crafted.

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"What a beautiful restaurant! The decor is light , airy and elegant inside yet so cozy with lots of greenery.  The service was impeccable and so friendly ! I was very impressed with them , we were a table of 12 with various dietary restrictions and they didn't miss a beat! they were extremely attentive and offered a warm friendly and fun experience and they were very knowledgeable about their menu and cocktails. we had the tasting menu and each course came with small cocktails pairings. Each course featured flavours that were original and prepared with care as well as assembled beautifully. Their cocktails were all super flavourful and unique , even the mock tails were a hit with everyone ! We started off with a plate of local cheese , bread and housemade jam that was wonderful ! The tasting menu the  featured 6 courses ,my favourite course was the pork with turnip , it melted in my mouth and has such amazing taste and perfectly cooked it blew me away ! the dessert was good as well their pistachio cake was delicious and they had a warm milk and chocolate combo infused with forest greens that was so interesting and seemed like something I would love to have on Christmas. I can safely say we all left satisfied. Although They are on the pricey side , but everything was top quality and every detail was thought about including the decor and the great service. I would say this is a great place for an occasion or to grab a cocktail !"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Perles et Paddock is a true pearl in the city. This location is unbelievably beautiful and stunning. The building looks like a fire station when you first set your eyes upon it but walking in the white walls and greenery lights up with the open sky roof. Simply stunning !I came here with a bunch of foodies so I was fortunate to try many of their brunch items. The avocado toast (4/5) has to be one of my favourites with smoked salmon, poached egg that was perfectly cooked; the chocolate beignets (3/5) were overly sweet but soft and moist, gazpacho (2/5) it's not a phenomenal dish to begin with - there aren't many ways to spice up cold tomato soup; the sweet potato pancakes (3/5)  tasted more like French toast with no hint of sweet potatoes but the fresh strawberries and candied pecans were a nice touch- kind of dry without syrup; Matabele shrimp roll (1/5) -overpriced for the amount you get -nothing mesmerizing about this dish, shakshuka (5/5) one of the best I've had -perfectly seasoned ; surf & turf (3/5) comes with a fish cake that was heavy on dil, eggs holandaise and bacon; the steak egg & chimichuri (5/5) and the chicken & waffles with honey comb and foie gras were both excellent - I just didn't have space for them; king oyster omelette (4/5) -great presentation and flavours, the sausage was good ; boudin (2/5) a blood sausage dish -this is an acquired taste I find - the presentation was spot on but the sausage itself is heavy on lemon juice. The prices are very reasonable 7-26$ and all dishes can be shared for 2. The cocktails are just as beautiful - I had a beer cocktail which was included in our special. This place reminds me of summer house resto in Chicago, which is a huge compliment. Looking forward to coming back on my own to relax and enjoy this beautiful venue."

/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Walked in late on Saturday night as I was craving one of their cocktails and we got to chat with the owner when we noticed the different menu. This guy listens to his clients! They took the tasting menu away and beefed up their bar menu to offer more generous portions for the same price. We ordered oysters (lucky lime, yum) as well as a tempura cauliflower entree which we easily shared. The flavour was spot on, perfectly cooked and the crunchy tempura batter on the outside, with a cauliflower purée, and marinated cauliflower stems, was just plain delicious! The service was as spot on as the first time even though this place was packed at this late hour. Why? Because their kitchen closes near 1 am offering great food way after most restaurants have closed shop. As always, the cocktails were just crazy good! As for their wine selection, thanks to the knowledgeable sommelier, you will surely find an amazing wine if the innovative cocktails aren't your thing."

/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Last time when I came, I gave five stars to Perles et Paddock. Yesterday, I went for dinner, sadly I had to remove a star. We were placed in the middle of the restaurant. For the longest no one would come check on us. It was difficult to get any attention from any staff because they would go behind the bar to the kitchen. Either we go after them or we had to yell after them. Water was poured after 20 minutes of our arrival. Then we have been sitting so long, about 35 minutes, but they never brought us the menu, and didn't ask us if we wanted to drink anything. We were getting a little frustrated. Then one of the host was annoying. He kept coming to take pics with the Birthday girl with a drink for her and with her balloons. We keep asking for the menu. I wasn't sure what to make of his attitude. He wasn't being serious. He brought another customer to another the table with menu. I almost raised my voice for the menu. It wasn't fair we were here way before them, and still no menu. Finally he brought it because of my raised voice. But with only one drink menu for 6 people. Honestly, I wanted to remove two or three stars because of this doofus. I wanted slap him hard sadly, but I kept my composure. When we wanted to ask him questions about the menu; he walks away and tells us the service girl will be with us shortly. An hour later, finally our waitress Frederick arrived. Because of her, I kept an extra star. She was simply nice, helpful with the recommendations. Afterwards, the service was improved thankfully. Our drinks and food were excellent as usual. I had old fashioned sour pisco (strong but soothing). My dish was the sea gallop. Every single bite was bursting and delicious flavors. In the end, our evening was saved by our waitress. I hope I don't see ever that annoying person in that restaurant when I go next time."

While it is not a cheap dinner by any means, it is definitely affordable and the cost is outweighed by the quality and care that went into each dish.Service was also very warm and personable.Interior and atmosphere is excellent."
/user_details?userid=gzt26zA5MqP45ecP0M6J9A,Mai Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is beautiful, I can't believe it used to be a garage. It now looks like a beer garden. Regarding the food, it was very good, we had the origami of hamachi, which was good, but not the greatest. Then I had the magret de canard, which was amazing. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend had the joue de boeuf, which I didn't particularly like, it felt like it had been slightly overcooked in the sauce.  For dessert, I got the chocolate dessert and he had the dessert du jour, which is a seasonal special: maple themed dessert. If you have the chance to get the maple themed dessert, please take it, as it was amazing. The portions are medium sizes.The restaurant wasn't overly booked, so it was great as it wasn't too loud so we don't have to scream to talk to the other people. You can really have a nice dinner. The staff was really nice, however, it took close to 20 minutes for them to take our initial order, that was the only negative thing I have to say regarding my experience at Perles & Paddock. Afterward, the service was great. Beside the only initial 20 minutes wait, this restaurant is great. I highly recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=pVNGGWaroaQ0MDHtBnmaHQ,Abir F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,A lot of room for improvement. Not enough complimentary flavors and menu is too safe for the price range it offers. Nothing special even though the presentation is really pretentious.Poor service as the waitress was lost and did not even know how to guide us on the appropriate bottle of white wine to order.We were a party of 3 and ordered 9 appetizers to share and were disappointed with 7/9 as most dishes were unoriginal and the meats were overcooked.
/user_details?userid=mteJOlja359dj7XYQnKzCg,Jay B.,"Chino, CA",4 star rating,"Quaint and relaxing brunch spot in Montreal that our buddy reserved for us the weekend we were in town.  We actually came here for Saturday brunch and came just as it opened..unfortunately, there was a power outtage that very morning, so things took a little longer than usual to get started.  We had a party of 10, which by comparison to the other brunch groups that were there, was small.  But we had a nice raised table by the bar underneath the enormous skylight, which was very comfy and bright, making the entire experience all the more enjoyable. Some of our group had the Surf and Turf, while the other half of us had the organic Chicken & Waffle (which was served with Foie Gras).  I was part of the group who had the latter, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken and waffle dish...the foie gras was really amazing, the texture was perfect, and by far my favorite part of the dish.  The chicken was a breaded, boneless and fried, and laid on top of the waffle.  It was crispy just enough as well as tender enough to cut through easily.  Not your traditional chicken & waffles for those Roscoe's or US-siders, but definitely good.  The surf and turf looked good, but the portion was rather small, and for the price, was disappointing to most of the guys in our group.  But i was able to have a bite and it was tasty enough.  Coffee was also good, so nothing to compain about there either.  If I had had more time, I would've added the bottomless mimosa for $50CAD, but we were short on it, so I opted out.  The service, outside of the power outtage, was great.  The owner came by and said hello, and the servers came by continuously to check on us.  I would definitely come back and try some other options in the future if I get the chance."

This magnificent et picturesque restaurant is simply unmatched! Transformed from an old carrosserie and designed by the owner, this stylish and chic restaurant emulates the Venetian interior garden, but with a modern touch. The owner of the business wished to create the vibes of the Griffintown, which has an industrial history and used to rely on labor of horses.In terms of food, we tried the signature dish of chicken and waffle, as well as sweet potato pancakes. Both were really good! The chicken was tender and crispy, and the tire-éponge added the sweetness to the dish. On the other side, the pancakes were served with strawberries and caramelized nuts, we were simply in love with both dishes!We also tried the famous cocktail and the St-Germain apéro, they were as beautiful as they were refreshing and well-balanced! The ingredients were seasonal and the mix was heavenly, you got to try it out!To end it well, enjoy the Nutella-filled beignets (baby donuts), they were really good! Bon appétit à tous!"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I had dinner and drinks here on a Saturday night. What a cute place! The decor of the restaurant is very zen and elegant . It's white everywhere with lots of plants.The drinks here are pretty strong!! That's what I want from a bar! They have a few interesting cocktails. I started with a cocktail called Le foie gras because I am obsessed with foie gras. It didn't taste like it though :( The cocktail contained of a liquor called Armagnac with foie gras and sugar. It surprisingly tasted a bit like an old fashioned. There was even a slice of orange in it. My boyfriend had the Seasonal Julep cocktail. It was a bit like a mojito but it contained gin, tarragon , cucumber, salicorne, white pepper, mint and sugar. Next I had the Verdita cocktail which reminded me a bit of a Bloody Caesar. I ordered it with gin because I like gin and the waiter recommended it but you can choose another type of alcohol if you wish. It  was like a veggie smoothie with tomato, parsley, cucumber, celery and it was rimmed with a chili type powder. It was good but I prefer a regular Bloody Caesar. I also tried my boyfriend's A Night in Tunisia cocktail and it was so refreshing! It contained pineapple rum, watermelon, ras al hanout (North African spice), sea salt and lemon.Everything we had was great! For food we shared the salmon bio entree. It had some cream with beets and cucumber watermelon hybrid. On top of the fresh salmon there was some crunchy stuff... almost like Rice Krispies. Then we shared two mains the duck and the chicken. Both were very good but the duck was the highlight. The duck was very flavourful and came with a side of string beans mixed with mushrooms and blueberries. It's a very salty dish. The chicken was in a form of a roll and deep fried on the outside. There was a yellowish sauce but I don't know what was in it. The chicken needed the sauce otherwise it would have been a bit bland.Lastly the dessert was amazing! It was pretty light and it was not too sweet. I don't usually eat dessert but I could have eaten it all by myself it was that good! We ordered the figues and pecan. Basically there was a thin circular layout of graham crackers with figues on top with a crunchy sugary layer and white cream on top and on the side there was pecan ice cream. I would come back."

We always sit at the bar and enjoy their amazing cocktails (they make some of the best drinks in the city here!) & then share all the appetizers and a dessert. Rarely do we order mains as the appetizers are so great! My favourite appetizers are the hamachi and the corn (in a foamy , fluffy soup texture)& lobster. Yum. The desserts here are a standout too. Last time we went we shared the After Eight (pic below) - delicious. Highly recommend this place for groups or couples."
/user_details?userid=ZxT_yQMHhu4Ac6UYgWGikA,Brute C.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"An incredible dining experience. In humble settings, the service was wonderful. Starting with creative cocktails, balanced flavors in unexpected combinations. My tartare appetizer was entertaining to the palate. Main course of arctic char was cooked to perfection with crisp skin, contrasting with white beans and chestnuts. The mango kiwi puree on the edge of the plate added just the right amount of acidity to brighten up the entire plate. Dessert with citrus flower had a crunchy meringue surrounding preserved lemons. Lovely. I sampled my wife's vegan meal and was amazed. Sunchokes, quinoa in almond butter. It was tasty and rich -- never believe that vegan has to be a sacrifice. The entire evening was charmed."
/user_details?userid=my4lYw_V2qKauwVTlBvOHA,Andy M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The good: beautiful room, amazing bar, and good cocktails. Management seems to want to fix the issuesThe bad: at least the night we were there the service and the food were both off. We waited 20m to get a drink order in, and by the 1 hour mark had only just put our food order in. It was one of those situations where tables full of guests with empty glasses and no food make eye contact with each other while competing to try to wave a server over - stressful and not fun.In terms of food, we tried the, Fried chicken:  almost no chicken, just chunks of batter with drops of sour buttermilk on top (I get it, you're deconstructing the ingredients, but it just tasted bad). Also, why does anyone think grilled lettuce is a good idea. It should be impossible to screw up fried chicken!Tomatoes and burrata: another impossible to screw up plate - all it needs is high quality ingredients, which they had, but... while the tomatoes were really great, there was literally 2 tablespoons of burrata on the plate. Just two tiny little pieces which they then try to make up for with some foamed ricotta which was tasty, but the whole thing just felt like they were going overboard trying to control food costsFried cauliflower: was like a made at home cauliflower tempura - kinda soggy and oily tasting, and weirdly accompanied by more sliced raw cauliflower.  It was neither high concept or delicious so I just didn't get it. Also this dish arrived cold, but you might starve to death if you send something back so we just ate it. Ricotta cavatelli:  I found this to be totally tasteless, plus the pasta was overcooked and mushy. The table seemed to like it though so maybe it was just me being cranky by this point. Shishito peppers: ugh, they ran out of shishito peppers and tried to pass off grilled baby bell peppers as what we ordered. This one is a huge warning sign to me about the future of the restaurant. If they think shishito peppers are so exotic their guests won't notice, hoo boy...Anyway, the staff and management were nice, and seemed receptive to our slightly bitchy feedback (sorry, I was still hungry!), and I do believe them that some of this just is growing pains since they're only a few months old. Hopefully they can step up both their service and their food quality because that beautiful room won't sustain poor quality of the other two for very long... We'll likely come back in a few months and see if they've fixed things, it's such a pretty spot i do hope it succeeds..."
/user_details?userid=kzXh1wIcCekofvPH5PGBgw,Gene K.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"Where to start? This was my favourite restaurant in Montreal last year, a place I recommended to numerous people for its great food and fantastic and friendly service...between April1'2018 to November 1' 2018 I probably ate here 25 times. The food was always 5-star as was the service, the decor is wonderful and the staff fantastic. Went back last Friday....what a disaster! How far this place has fallen in service is shocking. The manager/maitre'd was the same gentleman from last year, as welcoming as ever and remembered all our names five months later. And from that point on it was all downhill .....service was very very slow, took ages to take our food order. Unfortunately during the winter they chose to change from a simple, high quality 4-course menu to a small-portion, tapas style multi-plate tasting menu a-la Filet. Nice concept when the food quality is top-notch and the service can handle the multiple portions and dishes. Unfortunately not the case here...after our oysters and starters, which were excellent, we waited 40 minutes and were finally told our main courses would be out in a minute...20 more minutes and nothing, even after one of our party mentioned the ongoing delay. Finally they admitted that there had been a problem in the kitchen( I suspect they lost our order) and our food would be out right away....10 minutes later still nothing. So we finally told them to cancel the order and give us our bill. We walked out after two hours, having eaten a few oysters, 2 starters and a round of drinks....they were totally uncaring, no apology and the best they could do was deduct the price of 1 glass of wine off the bill. Considering that our party were such good and regular clients, the complete lack of concern for the terrible service and the cheesy reaction( deducting the cost of 1 glass of wine) from the bill was pretty awful. Considering the lack of quality in service and customer care compared to last year I have to suspect that the chef and/or owner has changed during the winter and the restuarant has suffered. I cannot recommend this place anymore."

I've come here for both dinner and brunch and have yet to eat something I don't like. The restaurant itself is lovely, a bright yet simple decor takes over what used to be a a garage. With a central bar and private dining room in the back, it's the perfect spot for any occasion. We tried the Hamachi, beef tartare and roasted cauliflower with the panna cotta for dessert. The menu is very allergy friendly and the food that is missing certain allergens is just as amazing as the other items on the menu. For brunch I tried the tartelette with salmon gravlax and avocado; a great balance of salty, savoury and a touch of sweet. I also tried the brioche, not to be confused with a cinnamon bunch, this thick bread comes with two in house made jams and fleur de sel butter. As for the cocktails, everything from the cocktail lists to the Caesars to a classic Old Fashioned are sure to be a crowd pleaser."

/user_details?userid=jg0eeUYN7zNLjmZiCgsxzg,James M.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"Tried out this new restaurant with a group of 7 friends, so we were able to share the entire food menu, minus the quebec cheese plate. First, we had heard this place had a solid bar, with a solid craft beer selection and great cocktails. While the cocktail menu was very promising, most drinks were extremely disappointing. Most people did not want to finish their cocktails, and we switched to red wine, a safer bet. We started with oysters, and while they weren't bad, they were far from great. That's when I started suspecting this place would be a let down, considering it's a market-food type restaurant with an emphasis on seafood and it had merely average oysters. While service was alright, the food was mediocre. None of the dishes were memorable, and my friend made a mental note that he was craving McDonald's, if you see what I mean. Didn't try desserts. Prices were fair. You can do much better in the area"
