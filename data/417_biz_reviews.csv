There is a decent variety of breakfast plates served with garlic fried rice and fried eggs. But since I went for the fried chicken and waffles I had to do it. AND I'M SO GLAD I DID. The coconut waffles with maple syrup go so well with the fried chicken it doesn't even mathematically make sense. On their own they're good, but so much better together! This is the second time we tried Junior and I will definitely be back again for brunch. There is more to try, and all of the brunch plates are about 15$, so a really reasonable spot to check out for a different brunch option."

They are well setup now for takeout though. Their menu is on various takeout platforms but I decided to call and just place an order by phone, it was easy and my order was ready in just 15 min.We ordered the coconut waffles and fried chicken band the breakfast plate with sausage ( lonsilog) . Chicken and waffles was my favorite, the spicy maple syrup sauce goes perfectly with the dish! The other breakfast dish is great, a nice balance of egg, rice, sausage and coleslaw."

I was feeling absolutely wretched. All I was capable of thinking was that I needed food, lots of it, as quickly as possible.So, a friend and I went to Junior. Both exhausted, both heartbroken from the bad news, we sat down and could barely read the menu through our grief and shock. We noticed that the table next to us had a big pile of food that was placed on banana leaves on the table, and we asked the waiter what it was. I forget the word exactly, but he told us it was the speciality here - half the menu, laid out on banana leaves. Usually you have to pre-order it, he said, but it's quiet today, so I'll see what I can do.I was nervous, because I developed an allergy to shrimp some years ago, and much of the menu had shrimp paste. We let the waiter know, and he said it was no problem - he'd make sure none of the dishes had shrimp. This was so unexpectedly welcoming and accommodating that I almost cried right at the table.The food came, and it was incredible. Tender, sticky pork belly with crunchy crackling, saucy ribs, tangy salads, fried chicken, an array of amazing sauces, a fence of rice around the outside, and atop it all, a fried fish with a tomato salad in its belly. It was just what I needed. The salty-sweet flavours, the spices, the rich fruity sauces, and the array of textures kept my mind busy and focused on the food rather than the awful day I'd been having. On top of that, the service and general experience was fantastic, friendly, and above and beyond what we expected, even though they couldn't possibly have known how much we needed it. I will continue to take friends and family to Junior as a representation of great food and great people. It was a real comfort to me in a very rough time, and I'll never forget that. Thank you."
/user_details?userid=nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,Bonnie C.,"Newton, MA",4 star rating,"I cannot say whether this is authentic or not since I am not Filipino, but I really enjoyed my meal here! My friend and I made reservations here for the kamayan as we were told it needed to be prepared ahead of time. We arrived a bit late, but they didn't mind as it was empty around 5ish (was a full house by 6pm). The kamayan came with green beans, fried fish, squid, fried pork belly, ribs, lumpia, fried chicken, and a bunch of garnishes on a big bed of rice.The green beans with garlic and mini shrimp was one of my favorites just because it is very similar to how my mom cooks it and anything with garlic is just superb. I also enjoyed the fried fish as well - originally I dipped it in soy sauce for more flavor, but then I ate it with the raw onions, tomatoes, and green onions, which added a whole new depth of flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The squid was refreshing and tasted very good with the shrimp chips.The lumpia was amazing but they only served us two of them - one per person I assume. The ribs were great but it was too spicy for me to continue eating so unfortunately I only had a few bites. The fried pork belly was great, but certainly lacked flavor (had to dunk it in soy sauce) and was very tough to eat. The fried chicken was good, but not the best fried chicken I've had. The batter was very good but otherwise the chicken was overcooked. The rice itself was dry and some parts were cold.The kamayan was $40 CAD per person which is not bad at all compared to what they would charge in the States. As a first meal in Montreal, it was overall very satisfying and filled me up after a long drive!The service was incredible and memorable. I will definitely be back, but I would like to order individual dishes instead. I don't doubt that the quality will be better when it is like that!"

Being Filipino myself, I found all the food from the menu to be top notch, doused in AuThEnTiCiTy!!!! SO FCKN GOOD. I wish I had pictures to prove and show you guys what I've had, but I'll take and attach some the next time I go. First of all, I'mma highlight their brunch menu because there's nothing better than waking up to a genuinely delicious Filipino breakfast. Brunches there are on Sundays and are super popular. Top favourites are: tapsilog, and fried chicken + waffles!!! For other main meals/specialties: pancit bihon, adobo baboy, and adobe manok. And for sides.. don't you dare come here without having their lumpia rolls!!!! Soooo mouth watering!!!!! For desserts: leche flan, and halo halo!!! Dieting? What is that. Vegans? What are they. You gotta LOOOOOVE MEAT to enjoy how this restaurant throws em doooooown!!! Jk.. kinda..they do have vegetarian options though  The vibe of Junior is super cool, casual, fun af! They do themed nights like ""wear your air max shoes"", and they have a fckin bomb ass dj who plays old school rnb and hip hop!! Seriously, this spot is always a good time! They've got Instagram since I don't have anything to show you: instagram.com/juniorfili… check it out!! And I'm so sorry Vancouverites.. this is in Montreal and not out here  I keep telling them to branch out here!!!!! ANYWAY! If you're in Montreal, GO TO THIS."

Nice little location, comfortable and friendly staff.  I ordered their Jeepney Pilsner from Brasseurs du Monde made specifically for Juniors and although I'm not a big Pilsner fan I did like this one it was very drinkable.   To start I ordered the Manggang Hilaw salad, fresh tomatoes and mango with a shrimp paste vinaigrette, I liked the salad, not so crazy about the shrimp paste very overpowering so I suggest just using a little at first as opposed to my initial spoonful.   For the main I ordered the Buto-Buto which is dry honey spareribs which were fall off the bone delicious.  Prices are reasonable however I was surprised that there was no rice served with the meal? Any other Filipino joint I've been to your leaving with rice in your pockets they are actually throwing it at you on the way out the door lol Overall a great place, their cocktail menu looks good as well.  5-7 happy hour 2 for 1 and Saturday and Sunday brunch 10am-4pm.  If you have not been make your way over to Juniors."

I always try to find different spins on traditional Filipino dishes. I mean there's endless of different recipes for adobo.Anyways, upon arriving, we were greeted by two friendly faces and one of them asked where we would prefer to sit. I ordered the calamansi mimosa. I never thought of this and why haven't I? It was tart and sweet. For starters, we shared fresh chicharron. I loved it but the hubby wasn't impressed (he's not Filipino so whatever lol).For the main dish, I had the chicken and waffles and he had the longanisa breakfast. He said the longanisa was good but nothing special. My chicken and waffles was special. I went to college in Kentucky so I consider myself a fried chicken expert lol. They said it's Jollibee inspired but its more crunchy which I actually like. The coconut waffles was different but good. It definitely satisfied my Filipino food craving during our Montreal visit."

My husband wanted the bangus sisig and it was the best one out of all we ordered. Service was also excellent. People around us kept ordering the fried chicken and waffles.

They waited for all the guests to arrive first before laying out the food set up, assuring everything would be hot and fresh. The feast consisted of fried lechon (pork belly), bbq ribs, fried chicken, langonisa, fried fish with veggies on a bed of rice, accompanied with various Filipino sauces! The food was delicious, packed with flavour and fried perfectly! We also go their Manila Sunrise cocktail, which was delicious and a must-try. The portions were huge and luckily, you can take home the rest! All in all, the portions are big, the food is great and the workers were really pleasant! Definitely would recommend this place, especially if you're a group!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was excited to try this place as it has been in my radar for a very long time now, so we walked in with a bunch of friends on a Wednesday night to order a few dishes and sample some of the popular cuisine. The space is cool, great wall art, and a real laid back fun vibe. We got seated and waited for a while to put in our order; there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant on the floor that night so it took a while. We ordered a few drinks; cocktails were okay overall but nothing great, really. We tried placing an order for food but we're told that the highlighted items were no longer available; thanks for saying this the first time around. Second time around, we ordered the fried pork rolls, a veggie crepe, the adobo chicken with side of sticky rice, and the honey garlic ribs. The food overall was good, nothing great, and not as flavourful as I hoped. The best dish was probably the fried pork rolls which were super yummy with the side of dipping sauce, and the adobo sauce which was great over the rice; you could taste the ginger which I loved! Overall, the food was okay and affordable for the quantity for this part of town. I enjoyed the venue and concept of Filipino street food but was only impressed with half the dishes we ordered. The service was super friendly but slow although the food came out quickly after our order was placed. I'd probably go back to try their daily specials, as the Wednesday tacos seemed interesting but probably not anytime soon."
/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Situated on Notre-Dame street, Griffintown, Junior is a cool little Filipino restaurant. It was my first time trying Filipino food in a Filipino restaurant. To be honest, I haven't really tried anything on their menu; how come? Well, we actually went for their specialty called: Kamayan. It's a very traditional Filipino way of eating.First of all, you need to call about a week in advance to reserve a table for it. They need to prepare all this in advance. Second, once the day comes, you show up, they lay down banana leaves covering the whole table.First, the rice. Then it's meat, after meat, after meat. Sausage, pork ribs in a sweet spicy sauce, lechon (which is basically roasted pork belly with a very very crispy skin), deep fried fish, shrimps, spring rolls, fried chicken, and to top it all off, they sprinkle some green beans on top. Gotta have some greens in it right?And finally, you eat with your hands. No forks, no spoon, no chopstick. Everybody dig in with their bare hands.Overall, the food is amazing. It's a great experience to have. It might not be for you but you gotta try it once.It's 35$/person and obviously, not vegetarian friendly."

The staff was super attentive and well explained the menu. I had never eaten Filipino food. I got the Bicol Express (coconut pork). And let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS. You should also plan to get a side order of rice. It was a bit on the spicy side, but it is not a hot spicy, more of a gingery spice. The meat was SUPER tender. I was very surprised.I was less in love with the appetizer we got, which was a crepe filled with veggies with a sweet and sour sauce. They had lots of fun cocktails on the menu that came in generous big glasses! They also have a fun beer list. I would skip the wine if I were you. I'm giving it 4 stars because I found the bathroom to be super Grimey. And the fact that I found the price was a bit high at first glance...In the end regarding price it turns out you can definitely split 2 mains between 3 average eaters...we walked out with a bill of 85 for an appetizer 2 mains rice and 2 drinks...if we were 3 it would have been around 40 a person, not too bad for a fun night out :)"

You had to call a week in advance to reserve so they can make sure to cook enough food. The experience was pleasant, the food was tasty and the employee was informative and offered a good service. A kamayan party consists of banana leaves laid out on the table to serve as ""plates""... rice is placed in the middle and covered with vegetables and many proteins (fish, shrimps, chicken, pork, beef). The whole point is to share the food with your friends and eat with your hands. Everyone enjoyed their food and had a great time.Price: 35$/person"

We ordered and food came out quickly, hot sizzling and burst out of flavor in the mouth. I haven't eaten Philippines food before can't say if it's authentic. + stir fry noodle with chicken and shrimp: hot and tasty, the noodle don't break in small pieces like other restaurants. + sweet honey pork ribs: crispy, hot , a little bit chewy (don't know if it's Phillipines style or not cuz same dish in Vietnamese food supposed to be super soft tender)+ rice for extra $3 (this I'm not happy about, it shouldBe complimentary come with the pork)+ stir fry string bean with ground pork: fresh string bean+ Manila sunset cocktails: I'm not too happy with the price $10 while main dish is $12 a little bit pricy for that small size cup and weak alcoholic level but my man said it's good. Mainly sweet for those who like sweet cocktail. This is why I rate it 4 star  Total bill for 2 main, 1 side, 1 cocktail and 1 coca: 69 before tip."
/user_details?userid=7Nq-eNN9v2-7PDQNLbg3Zw,Catherine L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here with a friend on a Sunday for a late brunch. It was around noon so we were able to snatch seats at the counter. I was immediately drawn by the colourful decor. The utensils were stored in reused metal cans which I thought was a nice touch. There's a DJ booth as well for weekend nights. It was difficult deciding what to order because everything sounded so good. Initially we wanted to order fried pork belly but unfortunately they ran out of pork belly that morning. My advice would be to come earlier for brunch (lesson learned). We ended up ordering the Longsilog which is a house made pork sausage. It's part of the Silog menu, a traditional Filipino breakfast with garlic rice, 2 fried eggs and bed of greens. The sausage tasted amazing and apparently contained pineapple     The fried eggs were cooked perfectly with the yolk still slightly runny and the dressing on the salad had a nice citrus kick. We also ordered the chicken and waffles which was served with sliced fruits and maple syrup on the side. The coconut waffles were thinner than most waffles I've had which worked out better because then you had more room to finish the pieces of chicken breast and drumstick. The fried chicken was juicy on the inside and very crispy on the outside like how you expect all fried chickens to taste like. The portions were quite generous for both dishes. I would come back again and try their dinner menu which has more traditional dishes. I would definitely recommend to check this spot out  if you're in Griffintown or make the trek down here, you won't regret it! Brunch menu offered Sat and Sun from 10 am- 3 pm"

/user_details?userid=XeocR5Pv87pMtgq_4Naxmg,Chesa C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"I was in Montreal for work, so during the week I couldn't do as much sight-seeing as normal travelers do. What I did end up doing, however, was abuse my meal budget and eat as much as possible. NO REGRETS. As a Filipino-Japanese American, I didn't grow up eating rich Quebecois/French food so by the end of my week, I was really craving for something familiar.If my cool uncle (or cousin) started a restaurant, I feel like it would be something like Junior. Since Filipino food can be tough to find in areas where there aren't a lot of Filipinos (coughAtlantacough), I think this is the route that Filipino restaurants need to take if they want to become as mainstream as other Asian restaurants. I ordered the tosilog (sweet cured pork, garlic rice, over easy egg). If you didn't know, ""silog"" is a combination of the Tagalog words ""SInangang"" and ""itLOG"" which translates to fried garlic rice and egg, respectively.  For tosilog, the ""to"" comes from tocino, which is a sweet-cured pork (it can also be chicken). I think the presentation of the tosilog was beautiful, which I owe to the salad and the plantain chips. The salad and plantain chips were both delicious, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the garlic came through in the rice. I did think that the tocino was on the dry side. Overall, it was a pretty good silog, but I have mixed feelings about it. Silogs aren't the most balanced and nutritious meals (it's all protein + rice), so I appreciate that Junior added a healthy twist to the plate. Even though the plantain chips were good, I think I would have preferred some chopped raw tomatoes (or a tomato-type salad) instead. A lot of the silogs I've had in the Philippines, Filipino-American restaurants, and at home usually come with some tomato. I think it would've been nice to have some of that nostalgia here.I also ordered a side of lechon kawali, because of course. The lechon kawali was the star! It was perfectly crunchy, while maintaining its juiciness. Since I was full from the tosilog, I took the rest of my lechon to-go and ate it on my plane ride home--it was still amazing hours later.I want to come back and try some of their cocktails and dinner menu items. Looking at the dinner and drinks menu online gave me a food boner.Service was good, parking was easy, and I look forward to coming back if I'm in the area again!TL;DR (Too long, didn't read?)- Good Filipino food in a modern setting. Super user-friendly if you have no experience with Filipino food.- The menu has both classic and fusion dishes. (Lechon and waffles?! Yes, please).- Decoration and vibe was the perfect hybrid of modern and traditional Filipino styles. Also, service was friendly and quick."
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"For the longest time, Filipino food had mostly been seen as comfort food, understood and loved almost exclusively by Filipinos themselves. Maybe a little lumpia here or some pancit there allowed the mainstream palate a safe gateway. Even then, most places I had been to that served Filipino food had it displayed behind a glass, sitting all day in hot trays, not the most appetizing food presentation in my opinion. Despite all that, for Filipinos like myself, our food is an endearing taste of our childhood, all that soury, salty, pungent, strangely textured stuff on our plate a delicious way to connect with our past. In the past few years, Filipino food has (finally) begun gaining recognition in the culinary world. Filipino fine dining establishments have popped up in California and NYC, receiving rave reviews. Being from California myself, I wondered if I would find the same thing after I relocated to Montreal. When I asked my friends here if there was such a thing, the resounding answer was, ""check out JUNIOR.""I've been to Junior twice now, once for dinner and more recently for Sunday brunch. The proprietors of this establishment are young, Filipino-Canadians who have framed the place in modern culture while still maintaining the integrity of our homeland. There are times where there's a DJ spinning 45s. There's a taco night. But the food and feel is PURO PILIPINO. And for that, I can say that JUNIOR is legit. Food-wise, I've tried two things, both of which I loved:Buto-Buto: this is one of those foods Filipinos consider ""pulutan"" (food that you drink beer with). Bits of pork meat on the bone seasoned and fried to perfection. Enjoy with one of their bottled brews and get taken away to an evening with the homies along a beach in Southern Tagalog. Fried Chicken and Waffles: The waffles, if I remember correctly, have a little coconut in them, which couple perfectly with these crispy, juicy pieces of chicken. You might want to ask for extra syrup :)All that said, extremely thankful to have a spot in town to sit and enjoy a little bit of home. Mabuhay!!!"

We had the Lumpiang Sariwa, a thin crepe with tofu and veggies in a sweet sauce,  and Ginasang Sitaw, fried green beans with veggies in a salty red sauce. We really enjoyed both dishes and the sweet and salty mix turned out to be an excellent combo. We will certainly be back to re-explore more of the menu.

I also found the garlic fried rice pretty interesting, it was all kind of stuck together in one mass. I dabbled my plantain chips and garlic rice with the various sauces provided: banana sauce (it's like ketchup), ""all purpose sauce"", and pinoy spice. All the sauces were tangy and fun!I found the dishes a bit pricy, but compared to typical brunch places it's pretty standard. Wished we got some drinks but the cocktails were expensive.

Junior has you covered! That's right, everything from fried chicken, to house made sausage to Filipino pork and fried rice. No boring eggs on toast here!A friend and I came here after a yoga class. In our post yoga glow, we thought what better idea than to eat fried chicken (it made more sense at the time). So we headed towards Junior. Although I am not a big meat eater, I do really enjoy a non-standard brunch. My friend ordered the waffles and fried chicken, which I was very sceptical about. I mean who eats fried chicken for breakfast? I think this is one of the those, you need to try it to believe it, because wow, was I wrong. The waffles were deliciously light and fluffy and the chicken was a really nice compliment. Don't get me wrong, I probably won't be switching up my overnight oats for fried chicken any time soon, but this was definitely a tasty and unique meal. On my side, I had the sunny eggs on a bed of fried rice, with sweet and salty marinated pork, pickle, plantain chips and a salad. Yep, all that for breakfast. Everything was delicious (minus a little too much garlic for my taste). Also, I left the restaurant so full I didn't want to eat for the rest of the day.

But with Junior, things just did not pan out. Junior, this review is out of love for you and food and diners. I want it to be a success! My best guess as to why our experience was such a flop? I suspect the chef quit. The guy cooking our food in the semi open kitchen was wearing sweatpants...I came in around 6 on a Saturday and there was only one other table. A little concerning, but the layout and decor of the place seemed promising!Our waitress promptly came to our table and apologized for not coming sooner because she was outside smoking. She honestly came so fast I can't imagine how she could have come sooner. And no matter how long it took, customers probably don't need to know it was for a smoke break! She was super friendly, though, and helped explain the menu and gave recommendations. Maybe back on track?My husband ordered a beer that was pretty good, but my cocktail tasted like cheap gin mixed with pineapple juice. I'm no cocktail connoisseur, but this was just so simple and cloyingly sweet. We ordered the ribs and the shrimp/noodle dish, which is where it really fell apart for us. I'd read on Yelp that the ribs were dry, but (unsolicited) the waitress assured us they wouldn't be. But then they were! We only got three ribs with bones, the rest was just little dry bits. The sauce had decent flavor. The noodle dish had puny shrimp - not seared or anything - and just generally had no flavor beyond bland veggies. Not to be a snob - I'd totally eat this food for take-out at a significantly lower price. But it seemed like a mean trick for the price and vibe of the restaurant.The only customers to come in the whole time were two friends of the waitress. And we left at a little after 7 on a Friday!I really wanted to get a taste for Filipino food and am a pretty open person when it comes to new foods and flavors, but this food and dining experience was just not good at all. I sincerely hope they can turn this place around!!"

I've tried Filipino food before but this was phenomenal. Had longsilog for Brunch with eggs over rice and salad and my, oh my, that was delicious. You can't really knock it til you try it. Also being a Filipino place in a non-minority neighborhood really helps the Filipino community gain exposure. And allows more people to try it! Overall, really great food! Will come back again!"

They have an outside patio in the back but we decided to dine inside since we had an infant with us.  There is house music for your listening pleasure.  We were there for Sunday morning brunch so I thought it was a little too early for it.  Apparently the chef is also a DJ.  We all ordered the ""silogs.""  I had the tocsilog, which consists of tocino (cured sweet pork), sunny side eggs and garlic fried rice.  Their silogs come with a simple green salad with vinaigrette dressing and fried plantain chips.  It was delish.  However, we were served lukewarm coffee.  Service was good though.  I would give them another try when I am in the area."

/user_details?userid=QMeZrGPwIbQL8nKYOjhsrA,Claudia C.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"We were a table of four and we got what the waitress recommended us. We ordered 4 dishes, 2 side dishes, and 1 large pot of rice. Originally, we were going to eat our dishes on our own but decided they were sharing dishes. There was the Buto Buto (dry honey ribs) $12, Lechon Kawali (pork crisp belly) $12, Adobo Baboy (braised pork shoulder) $13, Palanok $12, Vegetable roll $7, and last but not least. papaya salad (idk the price). We ended up paying 27 dollars each without tips. Keeping in mind, we got three drinks. There were plenty of leftover food and we ended up taking a lot home because it was so delicious! I highly recommend Buto Buto dish if you are getting a bunch of side dishes. Some might think it's a bit on its own. If you're one getting just one dish, I recommend the Adobo Baboy. You can pour some of the sauce over the rice. The crispy pork was also good too, but slightly on the unhealthy side. There was only one waitress on the floor but she was attentive and super friendly. I think her name was Kelly. I would definitely come back!"

Lets talk food: The chicken legs had a nice crunchy exterior while keeping the meat moist and juicy. Waffles provided a nice fluffy texture that contrasted very well with the chicken legs.Service was excellent! Water was refilled and order to table was around 10-15 minutes tops. The only issue I have with the place is that the portions felt a little small for the price. Maybe another side dish or something to really fill it out. Anyway an enjoyable and pleasant experience at Junior!

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"*** DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY ***I ordered delivery from Junior using ALCE. My experience was mixed but somewhat negative overall.I'll start w the bad: the delivery experience was terrible and I don't believe it's ALCE's fault. I ordered 4 items: 2 rice noodles, 1 pork adobo w rice and beans, and 1 pork belly w rice. They were all stacked together w the pork w rice and beans at the bottom of the bag - this was the only dish w liquid sauce. Result: the bag got soaked at the bottom and as the bag was removed from ALCE's carting case, it collapsed... yielding a mess (thankfully, the food was salvageable... but I had to clean the mess). Who stacks a liquid dish at the bottom of heap like that? Why not just use two bags. You know what, I'm ok if they charge me for the extra bag.Another bad: my order was incomplete (I think). The website claims it comes w sweet Mang Tomas sauce. Either it's invisible or it was omitted. The net result was an ok dish w unmet potential. Again, this is not ALCE's fault since they didn't pack the bag.The positive: the food was decent. Not great, but fine. Surprisingly, I felt the rice noodles were the best item - despite my strong ex-ante personal inclination towards the pork dishes.Verdict: I may try again, but definitely not w delivery. I will still use ALCE for other restos since many of my experiences w them (indeed, even the person who delivered this particular time) have been positive and painless. The problems (due to carelessness, I think) were mos def on Junior in this case."

We did want to try the food so we stopped in a couple of nights later.The same gent greeted us and much to our surprise, remembered us. He gave us some food recs and we weren't disappointed. The chicken adobo was tender, flavorful and went perfectly with the simple rice noodles.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Anyone paying attention to the Montreal restaurant scene has probably noticed the fact that between Griffintown, Little Burgundy and St-Henri, Notre-Dame Ouest has boomed restaurant-wise. The number of new and awesome places that have opened up over the past few years is staggering and difficult to keep up with. I've had my eye on Junior, a Filipino restaurant for a while now but hadn't truly made the time to visit. Over the holidays, getting the Montreal Cooks cookbook - a great book by the way - and trying a recipe from Chef Dre Mejia made me more anxious to go. This month, I finally find my moment to give them - and Filipino food - a proper try.I went both for a late night snack and then for their ""Rice n' Shine"" brunch on the weekend. I like the overall visual style of Junior - a indoor street vendor. Very colourful elements all around and the in-house DJ is a nice touch. I enjoyed the selection of music both times I was there but it was a little too loud on my evening visit. When it is hard to have a conversation at the table, it's not a good sign.To start on my evening visit, I went with the dish that brought me there in the first place - the Adobo Baboy - Soy-Vinegar braised pork shoulder. A nicely hearty portion of wonderfully tender and fall-apart pork. Perfect braised texture. The sauce is very strong on the soy so could be too salty for some of you but the vinegar helps to tone it down and creates a light finish. Add some sweetness, acidity and saltiness to the fatty pork. Very enjoyable - my imitation version just didn't match up!One of my friends chose the palabok - rice noodles with pork and shrimp gravy. This was sadly a big disappointment. It looked good but surprisingly had no real flavour - the noodles felt overcooked and only the egg served on top came through taste wise. The gravy provided nothing and the pork and shrimp felt brand and lifeless.Our third dish brought us back on the right track. We went with the Daing na Bangus - Baby Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic, de-boned and butterflied and pan-fried. First thing that hit us was the texture. Moist and flaky, the fish came apart so easily. The use of vinegar and garlic provided some sweetness and a little kick flavour wise.2 out of 3 wasn't what I had hoped but it was enough to come back for brunch with my sister. We first had the Longasilog - fried rice, sunnyside-up eggs, sweet pork sausage, plantain chips and atsara. A solid dish all around - I really enjoy the sweetness of the housemate sausage and how it mixed well with the runny egg and the rice. The plantain chips provided some crunch and the atsara a little bitterness. Very homey and filling.We also had the fried chicken and waffles - jollibee-style fried chicken and coconut waffles with maple syrup. This dish stood out a little more. As much as I hate coconut normally, the little hint in the crispy waffles worked really well and the fried chicken was outstanding. Loved the crunch of the skin and the overall moistness of the chicken.I'm happy to have finally been to Junior. It was great to try some Filipino food and realize how I do enjoy it and would like to come back. On the flip side, it was really disappointing to have a dish fall so flat on us. Junior is a solid part of my neighbourhood and a cool addition to the culinary scene in Montreal. Nice to have a generally underexposed cuisine be brought forth like this. I will be back Junior - I just hope that one blip was just that.Cheers!"

The dry garlic spareribs were just a touch sweet with the perfect balance of chili and salt and then Bang! the garlic. We had a chicken that had a curry based sauce. The french adorable waitress said to get some rice, just to eat the sauce with, and she was so right. Wow! That sauce ROCKED and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

/user_details?userid=42TfrOcb1Cucrzi_LCpNFQ,Czarina E.,"Hayward, CA",2 star rating,"The Filipino inspiration is there, but I felt that there were missing flavors. For example, the palabok tasted watered-down (as if the noodles were not drained properly) and the egg was scrambled rather than hard-boiled. The lumpia was too big for lumpiang shanghai, it needed more salt, and it lacked the flavors and texture of onions and carrots. My favorite dish was the sizzling sisig. Again, I felt that it wasn't the same as the sisig I eat with my uncles. Nevertheless, it was hot, spicy, and flavorful. It worked for me. If it's your first time eating Filipino food, it's definitely worth trying. If you're a Filipino craving for something akin to lola's home cooking, it won't alleviate your homesickness. Although the food was not what I expected, I thought it was tasty (rather pricey in my humble opinion) and I want to come back to try their other dishes and brunch.My biggest critique is the service. The servers were friendly in the beginning. As the crowd grew, they had less time to attend to the customers, which is understandable. But at the end of the night, when there were less people, the servers did not recover. They handed our bill without asking if we were ready, they fronted an annoyed demeanor, and I felt disrespected.I commend the chef for the food, and would like to return again. I just hope I receive better service the next time I visit."

So when we received the invitation to sample the fare at Junior, a fresh and trendy establishment specializing in Filipino cuisine, we were ready to go.Located on Notre Dame Street West, Junior's invites patrons to dine amongst it's bright and colourful decor. Upon arrival the first thing you notice is the aromas emanating from the kitchen as they quickly fill the location with the most tantalizing smells you could imagine. Tables are close and comfortable, one almost gets the feeling you are dining at home with friends and family.As we were not familiar with the menu we invited the attentive staff to guide us through the cuisine and asked to try the best dishes they offer. This is a welcome occurrence and the staff is ready to oblige at any time.We started our adventure with salmon ceviche with taro root chips, this dish gives your taste buds a kick of spice and opens your palate to experience these amazing new flavours. Next we were presented with buto buto or dry garlic spareribs. The smell of the ribs was amazing and equally matched by the taste. The mango salad came next and complemented the taste of the ribs perfectly. These three dishes arrived close together and the mixing of these unique flavours was pure bliss.Now that the appetizers were done, we were excited to dive headfirst into the main course. Our first dish was palabok, or an exquisite twist on pasta, rice noodles topped with shrimp and pork. It was delicious and something we definitely look forward to eating again. When our last dish arrived the kitchen staff was kind and served the peppers on the side so we could choose our spice level. When the sizzling sisig arrived, we found it bland and quickly added the peppers. Finally the dish was once again perfect. We were advised that this is the favorite dish of many of the staff members, a delightful serving of pork offal and ears. The dish was as unique as it was satisfying.After such a great meal, we thought it would be offensive if we did not at least try the desserts. What better way to end our experience but with flan. We love flan, but who doesn't. So a leche flan swimming in caramel was placed on our table, and as flans go it was one of our favorites. But alas we could not stop there as we were told we also had to try the turon. A deep fried roll of plantain and jackfruit, served with caramel dipping sauce. A dessert so good we could eat it forever.It would be our suggestion you grab your family and friends and head down to Junior, to to celebrate or create some new experiences and to experience some new cuisine.

Hers was with sweet cured pork (oh my yum!) while mine was with soy-lemon marinated beef, which tasted a bit like something I would've had during my childhood in Indonesia. The salad dressing was nice and sweet, which complemented the garlicky rice. The banana chips were very pleasant as well. The portion was generous, which was definitely a plus. The food, the service and the ambiance totally made for a legit island cuisine type place and as for that dude who told me Filipino cuisine was not very good, obviously he didn't know what he was talking about!"

However 2 our 3 meals were not edible. We had ordered the mango ""salad"" with shrimp paste. It was just a chopped up mango and tomatoes. Not mixed, no dressing... just the chopped up fruits that we were supposed to dip in shrimp paste, which in itself was a particular taste. I don't understand how they thought it was acceptable to charge 11$ for this when I could have passed by a supermarket and got same for 3$. Then we had ordered a noodle with shrimp and chicken dish , that just tasted like salt. It was pretty much just salt with some noodles, shrimp and chicken. It tasted like nothing but salt. And when we asked the waitress if it was supposed to taste this salty, she actually admitted that the chef had a mishap with the salt... but did nothing about it . We didn't get comped or anything. She had also said herself that she didn't like the shrimp paste, I don't get why she hadn't admitted this fact when we asked if she recommended it. It was quite a strange and bad experience. Though the braised pork dish and dessert were good... i unfortunately can't recommend this restaurant nor will i ever go back due to the strange service and none edible food. Sad since I've been wanting to try it for so long... but that's way too expensive for bad food."

Not to mention that the service was also terrible on top of that. My waitress was extremely pushy while we were ordering our food and then showed no interest in us after we had our meal served. I am also of Filipino descent and can for sure say that this is no where close to how my family would make these meals. Overpriced and not worth it, Won't be going there again."

Very attentive waiting staff who were pleasant throughout. Food was delicious and plentiful - we shared a starter,  main and dessert which was more than enough. My girlfriend, a master baker who is Filipino too, really enjoyed the Cassava Cake. No doubt we will return."

It took a while for the server to come to us.  The server ask if we wanted to seat on the  bar since there's only 2 of us  but I hesitated because my wife is so 8 months pregnant and the bar stoles doesnt have a back rest.  But good thing the lady server didn't really pushed it. So she handed the menu and right of the  bat we already knew what we wanted to order.  For myself I wanted to taste their porc Adobo and for my wife the veggie thing and porc rolls for the starter.  It took forever for the lady server to get our order that we are already about to leave.  Not even  water was being serve to us. Until one of the owner/server came to us and ask if we are okay.  Of course I said no and we are actually leaving.  The owner was politelyasking why we wanted to leave so I told him we've been  waiting for a while  now and my  wife is so hungry.  He was very apologetic  of the situation that we decided to give it a chance.  So he took our order and  we were patiently waiting for our food.  Again it took a bit of time than what the owner promised.  We were expecting for our porc rolls at least to be served first but to our surprise our Adobo came first and I did asked the lady server where is the rolls,  and the rice that was suppose to come with Adobo and the veggie.  I was already losing my patience. So lady came with the rolls,  rice and lastly the veggies.  I started eating my Adobo until my wife started laughing and saying this is Hilarious! She is eating a rolls that is not even a porc  but instead got a sweet banana rolls(dessert called turon). So again I got Pissed and told the owner.  The owner again was so apologetic and gave us the real porc rolls.  I admit the owner was  nice  but the food isn't good. I and my wife still prefer the food in   bahay kubo or papa's in van horne when it comes to taste.  I admit the ambiance at junior is better than the ones at van horne but would definitely   not recommend it. For the price I paid I  could get more satisfaction for food and service elsewhere and cheaper."

/user_details?userid=y-UWfVGfZTC6NiTUy5GHQA,Alexandra R.,Canada,4 star rating,"I heard through the grapevine that a new Filipino restaurant will open, so I went to check it out with a couple of friends last week. The place was packed, the ambiance was great - very laid back with some awesome beats playing in the background. We had to wait a little at the bar to get a seat (they were really busy), but in the end it was well worth it. The food tasted great, the pork was SOO tender! and so was the chicken, and very reasonably priced that it will not break the bank."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Junior was an interesting dining experience. It's a very, very cute, little spot on Notre-Dame. The dishes are served tapas style but the portions are fairly large which is nice. We ordered little dry ribs as an appy which were good. The chicken hearts were nice and the fried offal was good but everything seemed to have a basic overlaying salty flavour. I feel the dishes lacked flavour layers. We tried about 7-8 dishes in all. Some were good, some were meh. The shrimp was nice. My glass of wine (9$) was very good but by far the smallest pour I've ever seen. So I chose not to order another one. I would come again to try the brunch."

/user_details?userid=33eQhJ7NNyCfTsD-mv1ltg,Datchka V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Beautiful and colorful little spot in Griffintown with a chilling ambiance. We were 5 and we enjoyed our first experience into the Filipino culinary world.  My favorite plate was the adobo (pork). Price is more than reasonable for the portion given. A god variety of beer and wine. Definitely going back to try the noodles and desert. Yo all my epicurean Juniors is a place to discover.

Their brunch service is amazing and very generous, it reminds me of being in the Philippines. They have the best plantain chips as well. The service is awesome as well, very fast and efficient. I highly recommend Junior even for dinner service, their pancit palabok is sooo good."

My advice is to go with a group and order lots of things to share, like Filipino tapas! Favourites are the dry rub ribs and the incredible coconut milk ceviche. Brunch is really different and definitely worth trying. Prices reasonable and DJ spinning cool beats!"
/user_details?userid=0j0XQ8SH2M4vmmo5s30YjQ,Hannah R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Man this place was gewwwwwwd!!! We just left from brunch there and it was delicious! I am so tired of shitty, greasy brunch food or generic dishes and this place is such a good escape. First off, they have a DJ spinning Motown and soul and hip hop music so it's super cute and atmospheric. Second, the service is great. Our waitress was so nice and accommodating and knew the menu inside out. And finally the food was A+! Both dishes we got were really delicious and flavourful. The fried chicken and waffles were great. The waffles aren't super chunky and retained a lot of moisture and a unique flavour. It was an all around really great experience and I'll 100% be returning."
/user_details?userid=rarS1SPt1Ds7Ykddyohi4Q,E D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My friends and I went there on a Friday night. We were the first and only group at the time. The guy who took our order was friendly (he is the co-owner) and by the time the food arrived, Junior was starting to fill up. The place was nicely decorated - with a jeepney-themed look and funky tunes. Unfortunately, those were the only things good about it!The house-made tocino was decent - I liked the hint of Chinese five spice taste to it. The atchara (shredded pickled veg) that came with it was nice, too. The escabeche (fish) had too much soy sauce. My dining companion said the best thing about the fish was that it was boneless. The lechon kawali was tough and chewy. I asked our server to re-fry it (the skin has to be crunchy) but whnen it came back, it tasted just the same. We followed up on the pork adobo since it never arrived and after taking a bite, I wish we didn't bother. There was no flavour and the overcooked chunks of pork was just floating in a mass of under seasoned sauce. For dessert, we all ordered turon, which  was a total dud, to. It was not sweet enough and the center was ice cold. I bet the frozen ones you can get at the store are better than these.When we were ready to pay, the female server was very rude. When we asked for separate bills (she automatically gave us a single one for a group of 5) she got all agitated and exclaimed that we were ""making her life harder"" since she was not familiar with the computer, and that we were sitting on the ""group table"". After much arguing (we were fed up and just wanted to leave), we just paid the bill and decided to split the cost after. We were appalled by her attitude. We told her that we would have been happy to accommodate if she had asked us nicely instead of barking at us like we went there to eat for free. Such a shame. This place had so much potential.  I feel bad for those who have never had Filipino food before and goes to Junior for their first experience! If you want real authentic food with good service, try TK Restobar instead - or any Filipino joints in Cote des Neiges area (like Papa's). Better food and way better service. The owners are apparently known DJs in Montreal. Maybe they should just stick to what they know - music."

/user_details?userid=MJZhHTdaFxBYgz9bz9mshQ,Grace A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally! I found a place where I can bring my non-Filipino friends to eat and enjoy the evening, and they enjoyed it very much!! Our group of six (four Filipinos and two non-Filipinos) tried almost everything. At our table, we had varying opinions on what we liked best; however, our approval of the chicken adobo was unanimous. We enjoyed the lumpia, okoy, and turon. The palabok was tasty, although a few of us would have liked more sauce...since Filipinos like to drown food! Try the beer. I really enjoyed Jeepney. The wine list looks enticing, too.Admittedly, the service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was extremely busy. I expected growing pains, given that the restaurant is so new; I am not sure that the owners expected that many customers within the first few days. I expect that this issue will be adjusted in time. However, the owners were warm and welcoming! This made up for quite a bit. We did not really notice the time as we were having a good time chatting with other people in the restaurant, taking in the atmosphere, and really just enjoying our night.Junior feels like a place in Makati, Quezon City, or The Fort, with a dash of Montreal. If you want to go to a friendly place where you can hang out with your friends, enjoy some pulutan (finger/bar food), adobo, and good music, then I think you've found a place in Junior. I'm giving it five stars because I had such a great time overall."
/user_details?userid=3cTKXxBK6shS8LbbKzQF4g,Josh S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The first impression one gets when walking into this new & funky Filipino restaurant in Griffintown, is a sense of community, family, and culture. From the classic Hip Hop / House music playing, to the good looking smiling people, one knows they are in for a treat. This place reminds me of a really cool joint in Nyc called ""Tacombi"" with the VW Van parked inside it. There is a simplicity to the environment which makes one feel comfortable and at ease, with the staff that are eager to please. The menu selection is unique & delicious, from the coconut chicken to the fried fritter with shrimps in it! Price point is very reasonable, and drink selection (alcohol & non) is also out of the ordinary. Montreal superstar DJ brothers Jojo Flores & Toddy Flores are part owners in this venture, and with their ""PR star"" sister Bic helping serve the meals, you can't help but feel good about this family affair. This place is a welcome addition to the burgeoning Griffintown restaurant scene!"

Went for an early dinner and was really pleasantly surprised! We were recommended 4 dishes for the two of us, but 3 proved to be more than enough. The prices are not bad for the portion sizes and the back patio, general decor, and music is really fun and laid back. I would definitely come back!"
