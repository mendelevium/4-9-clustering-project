/user_details?userid=djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,Abby S.,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,"I'm still dreaming of my meal at L'Express and it's been over two months ago. It took me some time to sum up the experience and how much I enjoyed it all.Picture it: A somewhat gray, cloudy Saturday afternoon in Montreal. Feeling slightly under the weather, but still wanting to get a taste of the true local experience. And some fine wine, because wine makes everything a little better. L'Express came recommended and I couldn't say no to authentic Quebecois cuisine. Get there right around 5:30-6 pm and there's room at the counter, assuming you will leave in time for the 7 pm reservation to have their seat. Fine by me!Highly, highly recommend the country soup. It went so well with my white wine and hit the spot as I had been walking around for hours in the cold. Followed by steak and frites, which was pretty good. But the star of the meal had to be the soup, which I recently tried to duplicate at home a la quarantine. And of course I had to try dessert, a lemon tart which was just the right amount of tangy and sweet. Plus a glass of red wine, because why not?The food was all top notch and not terribly expensive. I thoroughly enjoyed my Saturday evening meal and will ABSOLUTELY go back when in Montreal again."

The cepes soup with jerusalem artichoke was an umami blast from heaven. Can't wait to cook up a reason to come to Montreal again!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"L'Express is a Montreal institution for affordable french cuisine. It's such a classic and I've always loved coming here because it's consistently delicious!Once you've placed your order, servers bring fresh baguette, cultured butter, a giant jar of cornichons and Dijon mustard to your table. They will refill your bread and butter until the main dishes come, which is awesome!I always try different appetizers, this time I went for the Rillette à l'Express. It was delicious, lots of fresh herb flavor and didn't taste overly fatty (even though Rillette is fatty!). It also tasted great with the cornichon and Dijon mustard. We also ordered the onion soup and a special appetizer, a leek salad. Each dish was perfect! For mains we ordered the ravioli, steak frites, steak tartare, fish a la grenobloise and the salmon. Both fish dishes were excellent! Fish perfectly cooked and their sauces were really umami. The fries that came with the steak were fantastic. Everyone was stealing fries off my friends plate! The steak tartar was prepared just how we like it and really well seasoned. All these dishes made it into the clean plate club!For dessert we ordered the famous Ile flottante and a fruit salad. The restaurant only makes 8 or so Ile flottante per day so I'd suggest telling your server that you'd like one for dessert as you order your appetizers and mains. One Ile flottante is meant for 2 people but if you have a small appetit, it could easily be shared by 3-4 people. The dessert is a pretty difficult technique and l'Express just nailed it! I also thought the fruit salad wouldn't be very exciting but I'm so glad we ordered it because the fruit was fresh, juicy and so nicely presented!Shout-out to all the staff because service was excellent as usual. At some point the host even went outside to help an elderly customer make her way into the restaurant. L'Express is a special Montreal restaurant and everyone should experience it. Their prices are so reasonable for the quality and quantity of their dishes. Cocktails range from $10 - $13, appetizers range from $8-$16, mains from $16-$28 and desserts are $6-10."

Every table full and everyone vibrant.I decided to do something different and ordered the Black Pudding as my main. Made completely on site, I enjoyed an incredibly tasty dish, spiced to perfection. I also ordered profiteroles for dessert, which I rarely have. Highlighted with a Baileys infused coffee with whipped cream. The staff were excellent, knowledgeable and just helped make the meal a great experience. A rare five star from me."
/user_details?userid=p_eViZiZwmE7R0FJnsZQDw,Victor U.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wanted to bring my Californian girlfriend to a typical French bistro, and l'express was exactly what we would find in France.The restaurant ambiance was slightly louder than I would have liked, and the tables were quite close to each other. I took the salmon and spinach dish, while my girlfriend took the risotto. The salmon was deliciously moist, well seasoned and perfectly flakey. The sauce was creamy and tangy, which added so much flavour to the salmon. The spinach was also creamy and could have been its standalone dish. The dish itself is very simple, but complex and bold flavours. Would definitely come back to try different dishes."

/user_details?userid=JpqpWvBQnJREquIQKvLfHQ,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"French bistro in Montreal that seems to be great for lunch, dinner, and late nightWe made a reservation for lunch on a Sunday and there were still quite a few tables open. There are a lot of choices on their menu and they have an English version (without prices). We ended up getting two appetizers and a main to share for the two of usThey also start you off with bread and a jar of mini pickles. The bread was just ok.. not fresh or warm. And I was a little ehhhh about the huge jar of communal pickles. It comes with tongs, and I'd like to think most people are sanitary but you never know....- Octopus and lentils: we were both not a fan at all... The octopus wasn't grilled or cooked... kind of just seemed soaked? not sure how it was poached or cooked. The octopus pieces were on the outside and the lentils were on the inside. I actually didn't mind the lentils, but I wasn't a fan of the overall dish- Bone marrow: comes with 3 pieces of marrow with toasted bread and salt on the side. You definitely need the salt to flavor the marrow. It's pretty no frills and simple. I enjoyed this dish, but wasn't the best I've ever had.- Steak tartare with fries: I always like a good steak tartare, and this one did not disappoint. I have a hard time eating it by itself, so I always spread it on bread or eat it with fries. It was a bit on the pricier side, but there was a good amount. I'd share this dishIt's not an overly fancy place, but they do serve good quality food on the higher price end."
/user_details?userid=D0Caw5JJXmQQ5luhH7ZvxQ,Carolyn B.,"Cincinnati, OH",5 star rating,"Our last meal in Montreal and what a high note to end on.  How can you miss when they bring you a huge glass container of cornichon?  Our waitress said that she has seen two people polish off an entire jar!!!  We all love cornichon and don't get it often enough with the teeny jars of it that you get in Cincinnati.  I even tried to make it once without success.  My waitress was the best ever because she let me speak to her in French and we managed to make it work.  Where I need help from them is to slow down a little bit when they speak.  She did. I could have kissed her and she complimented me on my accent!  and no, I don't think she did that just to get a bigger tip!  We had a bottle of champagne to celebrate having such a wonderful family trip together.  My son had a fabulous steak with shallot butter and pomme frite made the right way.  Hubby had blood pudding.  I caved and went for the Croque Monsieur.  Amazing!  When done right, it is really something else.  I'm afraid that I wasn't hungry enough to eat hardly  any of my pomme frite but they were done to perfection!  For dessert, we shared Baba au Rhum and Sorbet Citron.  I left our waitress a huge tip!!"
/user_details?userid=0iajoCW2mZvXtQd2_i_5nA,Jeffery L.,"Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,"I have been here several times with my wife while visiting Montreal. We returned after years away with our daughters. It has not changed and remains a great spot for dinner. There was unexpected traffic and construction that made us 20 minutes late for our reservations. The host was polite and still sat us immediately. No attitude despite us deserving it. The meal was well-paced and the the service was incredible. The team has it dialed in. My girls shared the beet salad and both loved it. My wife had the frisée salad with lardons and loved it. I enjoyed the special asparagus salad. For dinner my gluten-fee daughters loved sharing the steak frites. My wife enjoyed a pasta dish. I could not get enough of the house made ravioli. I seriously could have eaten two portions they were so delicious. My only complaints would be the ending. The desserts were mediocre. The profiteroles were the best. The crime caramel was really not good at all. And the eclair was somewhere in between. Although the after-dinner coffee was great, the fact that it arrived after the desserts was disappointing and odd. Everything else was so well executed this little flaw was a surprise. This place is so close to getting five stars from me and I don't give that often. I'll be here again next time I visit Montreal and hopefully I can adjust the ranking then."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been here four times. It's one of my favourite restaurants. It's necessary to make reservations because the space is not very large. However, it's possible to eat at bar without reservation. We have tried most of their speciality dishes. Previously we had fish soup, veal tongue, black pudding,veal kidney and floating island. I like them all but my husband didn't like his veal kidney with potatoes and mushroom. The kidney had a very strong taste for him but I have been used to this flavour as kid since my father liked cooked it for us. Over all I would recommend these dishes: fish soup, quail leg with wild rice, octopus salad (Luke warm), beef tartare, black pudding. Must have desserts: floating island, also orange crème brûlée was good too. Will come back for sure."
/user_details?userid=v0EpMF9gSH31Brr3PXpVcg,Puja L.,"Rockville, MD",3 star rating,"It's not fair because I had really high expectations coming here. Two of our friends highly recommended L'Express, saying it was their favorite meal on their last trip to Montreal. We walked a few kilometers to get here, and it was at least a bit underwhelming.We were pleasantly surprised by how relaxed and family-friendly the restaurant is, because dining with a new baby is hard. There were a couple larger parties, which helped drown out any fussing by baby.They have a HUGE wine list, but no cocktails or cider. We ordered smoked salmon and chicken liver mousse to start - large shareable portions with a baguette that was meh (and at least a little burnt). And the steak frites and chicken. Both tasty but not quite as good as I would have hoped. For one, the chicken skin was limp rather than crispy, although the meat was beautifully moist. Desserts also didn't wow, even though they sounded delicious. Bottom line - good but not great"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for a celebration. It had been on my list for a long time and I'm glad I finally tried it. Ambiance is very French bistro, and it's cool that it's open super late (until 3am.) Despite being decently upscale in food quality and price, it's casual. - Foie gras:  rich and smooth. I liked the bread the served it with - softer on the inside than the normal toast. Although we only got two pieces. - Potato Puree and Cod:  this was an appetizer special that was super tasty! It was served as kind of a dip and came with toast. - Jellied Egg: I've never tried something like this before but it was, in fact, an egg encased entirely in jelly. There was some sort of meat in it too? Unsure, but I'm a sucker for a soft yolk.- Roast quail: came with peas, a sweet wild rice and a couple of boiled quail eggs. Tasty and the presentation was really cool.- Veal kidneys: My first time trying kidneys. They're mixed in with mushrooms and almost kind of look like them. A firmer texture than liver, and the gravy it's served in is nice and savory.- Rice pudding: a dessert special that night. Rich and great with salted caramel and candied pecans.- Profiteroles: Maple instead of the usual chocolate. One of the best profiteroles I've tried. The pastry was very crispy on the outside and the sauce was reminiscent of the sauce for ile flottante (which they were out of and we were super sad about.) The service was a bit slow (3+ hours for the evening) but our server was helpful. We made a reservation day-of for two on a Friday night. Definitely will go back!"

/user_details?userid=A1WH7p28np55o_6xAKZxQA,Alan C.,"Cupertino, CA",2 star rating,"Overly hyped up and sadly underwhelming. We started off with the fish soup which came with fried/toasted cheese covered bread and a garlic tomato sauce that vaguely reminded us of a sauce from marseille that we enjoyed. This was the highlight of our meal; the soup was extremely creamy and has great flavor. The bone marrow we ordered was extremely messy. We're so used to restaurants cutting the bone marrow in half for us that were a little taken aback when they served them whole with marrow coming out of both ends so it leaked all over the plate. Made me feel like I was wasting all it's buttery goodness that I was trying to wipe the marrow off the plate with bread but alas, could not very every bit! My wife got the homemade ravioli as her main and it was refreshing. I can't quite remember what meats were in it but there were two types and it came with 5 pieces. I got the poached salmon which came on top of mashed potatoes surrounded by a lemon sauce and was not impressed. We topped our meal off with dessert and our waiter recommended the Ile flottante with caramel (floating island was the translation). It was essentially meringue hardened by a Caramel shell surrounded by a custard cream and almond caramelized brittle. The caramel shell was a little too much in the end. Overall, we were disappointed in the experience (food quality, personally think their actual service was ok) and by how many blogs/reviews mentioned L'Express as a top restaurant that had to be visited."
/user_details?userid=q4wDRjJPKWT6ieF7b680JQ,Willy X.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Maybe we just had a weak night. The bone marrow tasted gut, but it was cut into short pieces rather than length wise which made it nearly impossible to actually get the marrow out of the bone. The salmon was dry. While the handmade ravioli tasted delicious with excellent sauce, it was cold by the time it arrived to the table with a thin layer of film on top.There was also bread and cornichons served at the beginning; loved the cornichons."

The food is simply delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed. The clientele here is mostly older folks and locals, although I have seen few tourists near the bar. The service is good, it was pretty busy when I was there so I did feel it was a little bit rushed. Overall, very good experience and definitely will be back."
/user_details?userid=K95X5oE2-fuDZHhzFOfPUw,Meghan L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,I have always wanted to try l'express. Now that COVID is making dining out with friends more difficult I find the best plan is to get takeout and wine and head for the nearest park. L'Express has a very strict system in place for pandemic. You gotta order before 11am and pick up by 6pm. They post a weekly menu outside the restaurant. No where on this menu does it say this fancy french restaurant has converted to a grocery store. My pal and I arrive at the park only to discover the bag we picked up wad filled with cold food and cooking instructions! What the hell! What a way to kick us when we are down! Luckily we had ordered salad and smoked salmon which we were able to pry open despite its tightly sealed packaging. This restaurant needs to learn communication. If you are gonna serve bunker food let us know!
/user_details?userid=IjdJsFpsCx1P-8owC9HqSg,Xia M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I had the absolute best BEST BEEEEEST meal of my adult life here tonight! Duck confit. The duck had this rich color like the meat of a pastrami sandwich but super light crisp skin. Even the mini potatoes were crisped to perfection. This place is fast placed, loud and with French characters as waiters, all of them attentive and kind. I loved my experience here- truly a night to remember!"
/user_details?userid=he0VEAC0R2nWh_4Fk6atdA,Shawna B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A must visit in Montréal. The vibe is great - cafe/bar/bistro. The food was some of the best in Montréal. Oysters were the best. The beet salad, I cannot even emphasize enough how much I loved this simple salad. The beets were hidden under the lettuce, next to warm, yet crunchy heirloom carrots. The chicken liver pate was like crack! Only item we didn't love was the bone marrow. I think I prefer an open (split bone) preparation. My husband got the escargot special and was speechless. He said it was the best thing he ate while in Montréal. The octopus & lentil salad was also standout! The dressings that they use are light, yet tangy. Closing with a lemon tart dessert, which was very sour but delicious."

It really brings me back to the Bistros of Paris with the inside aesthetic, waiters, and the menu. The chicken liver pate is excellent, with pickles of course. The calf's liver, duck confit, and tartar are other excellent classics served here. Really you can't go wrong eating here and if you're looking for French food look no further."

All were reasonably priced and delicious.This was my first real solo dining experience and was quite comfortable and pleased with the service. Regardless of the food, which was very good anyway, I had a great meal with a great ambiance. If I come back to Montreal I will definitely come again to try other dishes!"
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"L'Express was recommended to us by a friend who used to live in Montreal as having amazing French food. We therefore made a reservation late one night (as they were completely booked until 8/8:30). At the entrance, we noticed an overflowing coat rack and checked in with the host. There is hardly any room to wait, but there were a few other groups waiting in the tiny space since no one wanted to wait outside in the cold. We waited. And waited. The host apologized, saying there was a mix up. About 20 minutes after we had arrived (on time for our reservation), the host asked us to sit at the bar and enjoy a complimentary glass of wine. I can't say no to free wine. The bartender was friendly and poured us glasses of our preferences. About 10 minutes later we were seated. We were given complimentary bread and a jar of pickles. I love pickles! Definitely a plus! I ordered the bone marrow and the ravioli. Both were delicious. I had a bite of my friend's risotto, which was also very delicious. The menu was in French and the waiter seemed to be more confident in French. It was definitely a nice dinner, and not too fancy to feel awkward or pretentious. The restaurant front is a bit unassuming and I heard people who were passing by say this was the best French restaurant in montreal. I thought it was great!"
/user_details?userid=6EQDa-MeN3jN6GJ2ftGeCA,Olivia R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I came here with my family to enjoy lunch and were quite surprised. Tucked away on rue st denis I didn't expect such a deluxe and delightful French meal. For my appetizer I had the daily soup which was so flavourful and rich. The highlight was definitely the ravioli! The mushroom sauce is so rich but so delicious. The portion sizes are a bit small but there is definitely meticulous thought and work put into each dish.

And that they did. My fiancé and I split a goat cheese salad to start. Crispy mesclun lettuce in a tangy vinaigrette, topped with four large slabs of creamy goat cheese. Let's GO. Next up were entrees - a perfectly cooked medium rare steak topped with garlic butter and served with a side of crispy fries and aioli for dipping. Let's keep going, shall we?  After that we enjoyed a bowl of meat, cheese and spinach filled ravioli topped in a rich and hearty mushroom sauce. Everything that we ate was beautifully presented and looked almost too perfect to eat. But, we did eat and finished every last drop of food on our plates.Want authentic French food while visiting Montreal? Want to feel like you are dining in Paris? Visit L'Express immediately. Just be sure to call ahead. We did not and were lucky to snag two of the last seats in the house (at the bar). The service is a little bit snooty, but the food was so good that they literally could have scowled at me all night and I wouldn't have cared. 5 stars and then some for L'Express."
/user_details?userid=kEVMEd0_xTrvwUg-IHG_cA,Stefano S.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"I'm pretty sure L'Express saved my life.I had just been dumped in California by my high school sweetheart of 13 years, 4 months from our (expensive) wedding. I came back from a business trip and she quite uneventfully remarked - ""I don't love you anymore.""One of my first trips after that breakup - literally months - was a business trip in January to Montreal.Everyone said I'd hate the city, why would you go in winter? This came from clueless Californians. Immediately, I was enchanted. I was alone; but enchanted. I met very lovely people almost immediately upon my arrival in this magical city....and the first place I ate for dinner? L'Express.I called the restaurant from a few blocks away. They answered the phone in French. I answered, poorly.""Bonsoir, I am... uh, I'm alone. Do you have a bar with room? I'll be there in 15 minutes or so.""""Oui, monsieur - no problem""I arrived to a wonderfully cozy and timelessly modern restaurant, front lobby full of coats and a singular, bakelite telephone that rings with a real ringer - a little hammer hits a brass bell - and it is just so delightful to hear ring as a well spoken, well-dressed employee answers and treats everyone with respect.I arrived and was quickly ushered to a bar seat with a brass ""reserved"" sign - utterly magic.Immediately, I was made to feel unbelievably at home and at ease by who I know now to be a local legend, bartender Claude Masson - he plopped down a jar of cornichons and was patient and helpful with the menu. The joy of the staff, the staggering quality of the food, wrapped in a completely unpretentious experience (and dining late night - what a joy) coupled with a glowing city that welcomed an outsider better than any other city I've ever visited on this earth. That is magic, and that is L'Express. And it was magic enough to convince me that everything would be okay."
/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",5 star rating,"L'Express -  Vive La France!! Late night visit after a show and we did not want fast food.. Hence L'Express. Octopus and Lentil salad in vinaigrette was one of the nicest plating I've seen in Montreal at a late night property.. The acid forward dish was the right combination, balancing  the octopus with the fresh tomatoes, olives and chives. The lentils were perfectly cooked and along with a nice glass of Pouilly-Fuissé. We then shared a country style soup that warmed us all up. A bit too many potatoes and slightly bland had to add a little salt to brighten it up a bit but enjoyable once we made our personal corrections. This was followed by veal kidneys in a mustard sauce with roasted potatoes that instantaneously brought me back to Normandy. Not an easy dish to nail but the kidneys were perfectly cooked!!! i will return again and again but will defiantly get a reservation before midnight. The room is a bit cramped but typical of a french bistro as your neighbor will join in your conversation and potentially share each others plates to compare.. Staff are running around and once you do get there attention they are simply perfect in the knowledge of each dish and surprisingly all the wines."
/user_details?userid=J7duvaxtVGPguXs5rlhDLg,Yun C.,"Berkeley, CA",4 star rating,"We're so glad that we made our way to dine here on our last night in Montreal. The restaurant is small and had a French bistro feel, very cute. Check out my video experience youtu.be/_01G91sSeSUWe came on a Monday evening around 6, without a reservation, thankfully, we were there early enough to snag a table before the reservation crowds started coming in. I guess, people in Montreal dine later in the evening, similar to the French counterparts :). The service was friendly but very laid back, they gave us lots of time browsing through the menu. The menu was in French but they also have English menu (though there was no price list on the English version but you can compare it to the French version to know the prices). The specials were only in French but the waiter was very gracious to translate and explain them to us.Upon sitting down, we were served baguette with butter and a jar of delicious fresh pickles with hot mustard!!! Yummmmm!!! What a great palate cleanser! So good, we had to constantly remind ourselves not to overstuff our stomach with these goodies!We ordered the Borsch soup special and the beet salad as appetizers. Both items came out very fast. The beet salad was very pretty!!!! Colorful, fresh and oooo sooooo yummy!!!! It was one of the best salad I've ever had! Not overly dressed, just perfection! The soup had small chunks of beets, beef, carrots, cabbage and I think potatoes, topped with creme fresh...oh my!!!! It was soooooo good! It was Perfectly seasoned, hearty, a great comforting dish on such a cold day!For the main course we ordered the pot-au-vou (stew with beef, chicken and vegetables)and quail with wild rice. Again beautifully plated and the Quail was out of this world!!! Crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, juicy, not overcooked! Delicious!!!! Certainly a dish that I would forever cherish as my last dinner in Montreal. The pot-au-vou though, was a surprise....I've had a dish with similar name, but it was cooked in some type of wine broth, similar to American pot roast. This was boiled everything in clear broth. Beautifully plated but you basically had to season the plate yourself (they gave a small jar of salt). I guess, if you want something light, this would be the kind of dish for you. The bone marrow though, was yummy! I spread the marrow on a slice of baguette, sprinkled with a bit of salt and voila, marvelous!For dessert we shared their famous ""floating island."" We didn't know what to expect, but oh boy, that was one large dessert! Certainly could be easily shared with 2 other people! (Even more if you have smaller stomach and not much into sweet stuff). It's basically a meringue coated in caramelized sugar floating on custard sauce with almond pralines ... WOW! It was good but personally, not something I would order again...too big too (n i usually never complain about size! Lol) ...my hubby loved it though. Btw, if you have bad teeth, this is not a good dessert for you...lots of chewing the sugar and pralines..Our bill with coke as drinks, came put to 95 CAD. Not the cheapest meal but great quality food that worth raving and coming back for. Highly recommended!"

With its classic pictures hanging on the background and The snuggly fit tables, this French restaurant becomes one of the loves of Montreal. A reservation is a must but a drop in is possible as well.

Duck confit, Roasted quail with wild rice, homemade ravioli, hanger steak with frites, steak tartare, bone marrow and 3 kinds of dessert: lemon tart, chocolate tart and ile flottant with caramel (egg white with almond on caramel glazed). In addition, espressos all around and an americano done the correct way aka hot water on the side. Other than the ravioli which was not that good, everything else was delicious.

The bone marrow is definitely a must for a novel experience and their shrimp risotto is good as well.I find the rest of the food very average but there is something magical about the place.

I found L'Express on Yelp and was very excited to try it out for a more upscale option on our anniversary trip in Montreal. The waitress came to our table and then multiple make waiters came over (drop off food/ water). They were professional.  We started off with the fish soup (had tomato base) and came with mini cheese toasts. Also ordered the special: stuffed zucchini with black garlic. Both were good but I wasn't blown away. The main course and dessert blew us away though..Main course: fresh sea bass and green beans Wowza!! Deliciousness Croque Monsieur (melted French ham & cheese) this was to die for and I got the side salad (huge) instead of fries. Dessert: leave room for the raspberry vanilla macaroon (best!!) made in houseThe made in house truffle was good yet richThe black and white tile floors were very French feeling and we enjoyed our L'Express experience. Next time we might sit at the bar for the croque Monsieur, sea bass, and a FEW macaroons. Bon appetite"

We booked a trip a little bit too last minute to get a reservation at Joe Beef or Garde Manger (actually, the latter was closed the one night we had in Montréal anyhow).We were not disappointed.As I understand it, L'Express hasn't changed much over the many years it's been around. And it shouldn't. It has the feel of a classic Parisian bistro, a little tightly packed, a little noisy, but with an awe-inspiring wine list and a great menu of classics. I went for house-made Toulouse sausages, served with mashed potatoes and an incredible gravy, while Herself had steak frites.Server made an unpretentious but excellent wine recommendation that fit both meals perfectly, and then for the most part left us alone, which frankly, is how it should be.We wound up too full to consider dessert in the end, likely from the folly of a snack to tide us over until our 8pm reservation.Don't neglect the pickles they bring to the table, they are amazing."

However, I failed to see what the hype was all about, as the food was very good but not necessarily significantly better than any of my other Montréal dining experiences. Then chicken liver pate with pistachios was delicious, as was the foie gras terrine. The bone marrow was good, but a huge hassle to eat because the spoons didn't fit inside properly. Each table is given a jar of adorable little pickles and they were delicious! For my main, I had the quail and it was pretty good, nothing to write home about. One of my friends had the shrimp risotto and that was delicious! Someone who had the lemon sage chicken breast reported that it was incredibly dry. But if you're looking for something a little different, the calf liver was delicious!The service was good but not terribly attentive. We had to remind our waitress to bring silverware a couple times, but I totally get that we were eating during a Friday lunch rush. Overall, delicious and good.

Self serve salt. Shrimp risotto - the risotto to die for. Perfectly cooked and the shrimp is done just right.Beef tartar - very good and not skimpy on the capers. It's a bit spicy for those who cannot handle horse radish kind of spiciness and the salad that comes with it is good as well. Beef ravioli - The sauce was very delicious, we used the extra bread to soak up the remaining sauces. Wish there was more - there were only 5 ravioli! Dessert wise - the meringue dome is impressive but it's rather big and if I were to come back I would skip this one. Everything was a knockout, thank you L'express! Merci"

No disgusting overnight organ aftertaste. Not fishy, as some would say. One of the best I've eaten, as compared to all the D.C. French places and European French places. Even Lefite wasn't that good. Duck confite was on point. Smoked and then fried. Just pure joy eating this. So much meat and still have quality juicy flavors. Fresh and elegant. Some may not be a fan of the plating. For this price and quality, I don't mind the presentation/plating. Quail was legit too. The poached technique keeps the legs moist and flavorful.

Food is consistent and service is very friendly with a cozy atmosphere. Ever since the first time I came to this place, I dreamt of coming back and enjoying that roasted quail dish. The bone marrow was also one of my favourite, but at this visit, I was overfilled with cholesterol from the night before so I decided against it. Fish soup was very light and on the watery side. It had a clean fish flavour in a slight tomato-y broth.Green salad was perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette on fresh greens. I loved this salad. Roasted quail with wild rice is something everyone should try. Everything about this dish is just so perfect. The quail is so crisp on the outside with juicy meat on the inside. The sauce it's drizzled with is very flavourful and a little salty, but it added to the dish. The rice was perfectly cooked. I loved the chewy texture and it all came topped with green peas and quail eggs yum!!The beef tartar was really fresh and was dressed with just the right amount of capers, sauce and whatever they bind it in without taking away from the flavour of the beef. I tried a bite of my sister's octopus lentil salad and it was delicious! She raved about it and cleared the whole plate. I love this resto and I've also heard nothing but great things from others who have visited on more than one occasion. This place is a must when visiting Montreal."

We walked past and missed this place our first try as the entire front is covered in scaffolding with a building design on a canvas covering it all, leaving it easy to be missed. The inside decor is very Parisian, and there are many appetiser, main and dessert options to suit many tastes. The one thing I would note is that hardly any of the wines they serve are by the glass (most only by the bottle) and I wish they had descriptions of each dish, as I ordered the shrimp risotto expecting a light, non dairy dish but it was heavily drenched in cheese - partially my fault as risotto can have cheese or not, but I wish I had known that before as a lactose sensitive person.

/user_details?userid=8oDB6mhtccdTy3O66PmxhA,Mike H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"L'Express is one of the iconic French restaurants in Montreal dating back to the 80's. The restaurant's interior is classy, and for the short period of time that you're there the clock gets turned back. My friends and I ordered several things to share:Celery remoulade: thin strips of celery root tossed in a housemade remoulade sauce topped with chives. This was quite large in portion, and the remoulade sauce was very strong. A bit too tart for my taste, but served as a nice appetizer.Roasted quail with wild rice: this was delicious. The quail was perfectly roasted with a slightly crispy exterior. The meat was moist and very flavorful, and the wild rice and quail eggs both served as nice sides.Epaule de porcelet croustillante: roughly, this is crispy pork loin in a creamy mustard sauce. But it's not just any pork: porcelet is a pig suckling that is fed with milk, and is truly the ""cream of the crop"" when it comes to pork. Unfortunately I am not a pork eater, but my friend did say that this was some of the best pork that he has ever had.Ttoro basque: a Basque style fish stew cooked with pieces of sea bass, shrimp, mussels, fennel, and potatoes in a rich fish broth. This was perhaps one of the best fish stews that I have ever had. The fish broth was strong but not overpowering, and had a nice sweetness in the taste. All of the seafood weren't overcooked, and the roasted fennel really compliment the entire stew very nicely. Literally wiped the entire bowl clean (I had to ask for extra bread!).Orange creme caramel: for dessert, we shared this, which is essentially a flan topped with candied orange peel in a caramel sauce. Simple, but elegantly presented. The orange peels were delicious and not even slightly bitter, and complimented the slightly sweet flan and caramel sauce well. A delicious ending.Service was very good, and our server was patient explaining to us virtually everything on the menu as we indecisively made our orders. Kudos to them!This stands as one of the most memorable meals that I have had in quite some time. A real bummer that I can't be coming here everyday!"

Perfect example of melt-in-your-mouth goodness. They also give you a giant jar of cornichons to snack on, which is nice.For my entree, I had the quail with dirty rice. It was served with romaine lettuce, so you could make a scoop out of it. The rice was great, but the quail... the quail was was amazing. Five pieces of perfectly cooked poultry.I also tried my buddy's steak frites, which were also really good. A bit heavy though, but that's to be expected.This was our last meal in Montreal before heading to the airport, so we moved to the bar to have some coffee before we left. The host (or manager? or owner?) came by and offered us shots of this coffee liqueur in celebration. She did one with us as well.

Called day of on Saturday and was able to get a table for 2 at 645pm.We got served the complimentary bread and butter. Butter was cold, which made it terrible for spreading. I'm not sure why some restaurants don't provide room temp or whipped butter as it just comes off as cheap otherwise. We ordered the bone marrow, ravioli and hanger steak. The bone marrow was as expected and not bad. The ravioli was decent and had a interesting mushroom sauce. The steak was cooked well however the fries seemed fairly oily (puddle of oily at the bottom). Overall, I think the prices are above average for what you get and the experience is average at best.

For entrees, I had quail which was very good and my wife ordered the hangar steak, also very good.The desserts were the best thing of the evening. We had the chocolate tarte, excellent and some very good profiteroles."

Had 12:30 reservation today & were warmly greeted and seated upon arrival at 12:05 (no traffic in MTL today LOL). Freshly brewed robust coffees came immediately & were constantly refilled. Milk or cream offered, the cream was thick, maybe 35%. All tables receive a mason jar stuffed with cornichons, and sliced baguette with ramequin of butter. Friend said all were great. We shared goat cheese salad that had 4 generous portions of tangy creamy goat cheese sitting on 4 large crouton rounds sitting on a bed of simply dressed bitter greens garnished with split kalamata olives. If you love goat cheese (like I do) you'll love this dish. We each had croque monsieur offered with either salad or fries. We both had the salad. Kidding! But those fries, not your typical greasy Quebec style (Lafleur/LBP etc.) probably cooked in duck fat but I'm guessing and they were sooo good. Should have taken the uneaten ones home because I could've eaten them cold with the garlic aioli they came with. The croque monsieur was buttery golden on the outside & inside bechamel coated ham covered ooey-gooey cheesy goodness. Best ever. I ordered Ile Flotant for the birthday girl who was blown away by the presentation. Meringue boule candy coated sitting on a pool of creme anglaise with almond pralines. Huge portion, we tried but couldn't finish. Service was super friendly, extremely professional from maitre d to awesome server to busboy. Can't believe it's my first visit. Will return soon."

That, coupled with the service and the price, earns a 2 star review. What we ordered: the escargot, foie gras, and marrow for appetizers; hanger steak with fries and duck leg for entrees; chocolate tart and profiteroles for dessert. The best thing were the desserts. The tiny piece of steak was served next to more French fries than any one person could finish, which was weird. The table next to us also commented on their own insurmountable mountain of fries. The bone marrow was inedible. The spoon they give you doesn't fit inside the bone. I used a knife to try to get the marrow out but was largely unsuccessful and made a greasy mess of my hands in the process. I commented on the difficulty of getting it out to the waiter, to which he replied that it was a matter of skill. Uh, sir, after 10 minutes of struggling with every utensil you gave me, I don't think so. The toasted bread the marrow came with was rock hard and unappetizing. The steak was good but tiny. The duck, escargot and foie gras were nothing special. Service was very rushed. Our initial waitress was nice but she disappeared after taking our order. We were then served by two young men who were clearly in a hurry to turn over the table.Definitely overrated."

All the dishes were delicious- each dish was seasoned well and was very comforting after a long day of exploring the city. Overall a pleasant dining experience and perfect for date!

Quite small with friendly staff and delicious food!We went around noon on a Friday afternoon, right when things picked up for lunch. All of our food showed attention to technique and tasted delicious. The bone marrow appetizers are very large, full marrow bones served with coarse salt, alongside their bread and butter. Very good.The rillete was also delicious. I did not love the sorrel soup but others in the group did. They also serve a large jar of cornichon pickles that are so sour and tasty!For entrees we had the calf liver (smelled amazing with the tarragon, cooked so gently, very nice) and the steak tartare (spicy, seasoned, mustardy, good!).For dessert, the profiteroles were so perfect. The choux was cooked to a crisp outside and delicate inside, filled with maple ice cream. Not too sweet.Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating; she brought crayons for the kids, pink lemonade, and saw to our needs often without words even being needed. Loved our meal and would return!"

We never should have doubted him, however, as he picked L'express and it was nothing short of amazing. From the second we walked in, it felt like we were transported back to France. What with the checkered black and white floor and the palm trees, L'express exemplifies the traditional Parisian bistro. And I absolutely loved it.To start, we split the Duck Foie Gras Terrine and the Bone Marrow with Coarse Salt, both of which were delicious. This was my first time having bone marrow off the bone, so I quite enjoyed scooping it out and spreading it onto the toasted bread. Each table was also given a huge jar of brined pickles, which I had quite a few of along with the spicy dijon mustard. For my entree, I ordered the Homemade Raviolis, which our waiter informed me was a pork and veal blend served in a mushroom glaze. Being a huge fan of mushrooms, I was not disappointed. It was a tad bit salty, but good nonetheless. The rest of my family ordered the Steak Tartare, the Sautéed Duck Confit, and the Hanger Steak. They all thought everything was delicious, minus the steak tartare, which was slightly under seasoned. We ordered the Ile Flottante with Caramel and the Apple + Blueberries Crumble for dessert. None of us have ever had ile flottante before and were very pleased with it. Both the meringue and crème anglaise were delicious and not too sweet. My favorite was the crumble though, as I love me some crumble. We all left the restaurant pleasantly happy and full. Most definitely letting dad pick out a restaurant again next time!"

Well obviously I love it so much that's why the repeated return.Service has always been very good, professional and attentive. The ambience is energetic, very French, and European feel. Little tables with white paper on them, which is a classic bistro/brasserie feels. It is a smaller version of Balthazar in NYC, but the menu is much better than Balthazar. They have items that are hard to find i.e. Veal Liver, Veal Kidneys, Rabbit Terrine and etc. Food taste really authentic, well executed and classically presented. Dessert wise expect creme brûlée, profiteroles, lemon tart, chocolate tart, floating island. Expectation is always met with no disappointment. Price wise in my opinion is reasonable and fair for the quality you get. Will definitely return again & again, and I highly recommend this place when visiting Montreal."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you ever want to have a decadent lunch or dinner by yourself sometime, come here, sit yourself down, order the bone marrow starter, the steak frites, a glass of wine and then let a completely sensuous eating experience unfold.After hitting the Sri Aurobindo store down the street and my mind still immersed in the rarefied spiritual air of Hindu futurist philosophy, I found myself in this part of town yesterday and realized it had been awhile since I had been to L'Express, easily hands down one of the best French (as in from France) bistros in town. You will find all the old stand-by classics of any French bistro or brasserie whether here or in Paris, homemade mayonnaise, chicken liver pate, bread, baguette slices, cornichons (gherkins), French onion soup gratinee, calf liver, steak tartare, steak frites, profiteroles, creme brulee, cheese plates, extensive wine and digestif lists, a bar full of brass fixings, mirrors, lively conversation happening everywhere, and a general air of conviviality. Yesterday we had the first snowfall of the winter and I was craving something comforting, warm and rich. The bone marrow starter hit the spot. Unctuous, rich, decadent and probably very bad for you, you can't eat something like this every other day. Served up in its bone, with toasted baguette slices, this is a treat and can rival a filet mignon in its richness and taste. (I'm just surprised how bone marrow has suddenly become an ""It"" item in recent years when we've been eating it for centuries in Muslim India in the form of Nihari, a super-slow cooked curry soup full of bone marrow and meat). The steak frites came with homemade mayonnaise and a slice of parsley butter melting all over the steak. Again, perfect. There was absolutely no way I was going to be able to have a dessert particularly the famous floating island so I settled on a single scoop of lemon sorbet instead to offset the richness of the meal.Attentive and friendly service, wonderful food, great lively atmosphere, you'd be hard-pressed to find something as established and classic as L'Express."

Given the high ratings, I was excited to try this restaurant but was disappointed that it was another one of those overrated restos.Had the octopus and lentil salad, which was rather flavorless. Shared a fish soup with my boyfriend, which tasted pretty good. Wish they had French onion soup on the menu though, as I was craving that before I came in. For my main, I had the poached salmon, which was served atop some mashed potatoes with a cream sauce surrounding it. Again, the dish was rather flavorless and felt very heavy. While they did have a lemon slice for me to squeeze lemon juice over it, I do wish they added something a little bit acidic (say pickled veggies) to cut the overall creaminess of the dish.Service was overall friendly and no complaints there. Unfortunately, food quality was just not up to par."

Reservation recommended! (just seems like the norm in any French restaurants in Montreal)Is it just me or I felt like there has not been any single bad dining place in Montreal? L Express is no exception - although this is not a necessarily a 5 star place to eat yet even the less than stellar restaurants actually are pretty good. It's just one of those things with French sophistication - the standard bars are pretty high across the board.Managed to visit this place during one of our restaurant hopping in Montreal the past thanksgiving. We tried to come without reservation on one of the weeknights around 8ish and we were told that they had no place until 10 PM, so we decided to take place our names down and hung out at different place in the meantime.So when we came back, we have already had some bites by then..so my friends and I decided to share shrimp risotto and the homemade raviolli! Food came out pretty quick, the shrimp risotto actually turned out not to be my favorite dish (2 out of 5), texture was a little off as the rice was more solid/starchy than more like a porridge consistency. And the vegetables inside it were still a little tough. The homemade ravioli  with mushroom was a totally different story. it probably was one of the best mushroom raviolis I ever had anywhere. The gravy that was part of the dish elevated the dish to another level. (5 out of 5). Another thing was that the portion was a little too small than my liking. It probably was for the better that we did have a small bite before coming here. So there you have it. Average rating = 3.5 stars."

This is how we decided to book a dinner at L'Express and the visit was so enjoyable that we started planning another visit during the second course. First we loved the vibe of L'Express, the dynamics, the noise, the energy. L'Express is may be the most French bistro among all the bistros in Montreal, it is also an example that there is no need to be fancy and there is enough elegance in simplicity. Second we chose as our preferred sitting the bar. Nothing surprising, that has been always our beloved place to be in a restaurant as the interaction with the bar tenders may be priceless.... Don't miss the chance to enjoy a dinner at the bar is my recommendation and also ask for advice what wine matches better your food. I did not see a cocktail menu, but mixes are made on demand and they are good.    Third the food is wonderful. I would not allow myself the extravaganza of eating bone marrow, french fries and steaks every day, but from time to time, oh yes and preferably at L'Express! The french fries are amazing and they are served with home made mayo. The hanger steak and steak tartare were superb. Don't get me wrong, there are some healthier choices in the menu. We also loved the home made pickles, and the extensive dessert list, and the endless digestive options, including few choices of Armagnac.Genuine five stars and shared love!"

We set at the counter and had a nice time chatting with a pair of our neighbors and the lovely gentlemen waiting on us.The menus were both in English and French and contained a generous but not overwhelming number of dishes.  The burrata, served in the form of a caprese salad was as good as it looked, fresh and delicately balanced. The octopus was overcooked, but I actually liked it nonetheless. The presentation on this one especially, screamed old French dinning. The lobster risotto and the steak were both very nice. They had a great selection of wines by the bottle and the whole experience was very reminiscent of dinners in Paris.

Let me start off by giving you fair warning 'DO NOT go here any later than 10pm' they have literally nothing left on the menu that's available other than the days left overs like  soups, some pasta dishes and basic chicken or fish. If you have your eyes and belly set on the coveted 'marrowbone with sea salt or quail' prepare to be disappointed.  To add insult to injury we had a snobbish, stuck up French speaking waiter who completely ignored our existence. For the first time in a long time I felt like my skin color was to blame and my lack of the French language came in the way anyway I brushed it off but it was enough to make me sit there feeling pretty uncomfortable and disappointed.

It's a classic French bistro, reasonably priced, with a ton of regulars. On a recent trip, I had no less that 8 different locals tell me that it was ""essential"" that I go here. Why? The Wine.The wine list is AHHmazing, heavy on French wines, especially the south of France, many bottles of which cannot be found elsewhere due to a direct relationship between the buyers and the wine makers. Furthermore, for someone (moi) who has fallen madly and in absolute bonkers in love with natural wine/ vin naturel, the menu makes it easy to pick them out, as they are denoted as (bio.) on the menu. Did I mention that the markup on the wines are extremely reasonable? I saw bottles listed on the menu sold at or below US retail cost, whereas at restaurants bottles can be marked up 200-300% plus. What a great, classic spot. I'm so glad the locals who pointed me out to this place shared the joy."

Now onto the food.Apps - Foie gras- I know this is controversial plate but wow. This was the best tasting foie gras I had and I had foie gras in Paris to compare. Bone marrow- I typically like the bone marrow that is broiled to have that crispy crust but this was still decadent and deliciousOctopus- if I had to choose, this was probably my least favorite ofthe three but still good nonetheless! Entree-Quail- sooo so soooo good! Whatever the sauce was, it was amazing and the quail was so moist. The wild rice underneath also have a nice addition due to the texture. Everyone said they loved my dish the bestSteak tartar- this was also so good! Most steak tartar I've had, I feel like the ingredients they add overpower the steak a bit but this place it was perfect. Nothing over powered the flavor of the meat and it was nice and light and delicious Steak and frites- the steak was also on par with the fries. If you're not with group and great to try a bit of everything, I'd recommend going for another dish since steak and fries can be done elsewhere. DessertOriginally my group wasn't planning to get dessert since we were stuff but the waiter brought out this amazing dish on the house! ( service was also amazing here.

The place is cozy and clean. It's lively and filled with conversation, but my boyfriend and I felt like we were the only diners in the space. The service was absolutely pristine -- our bread basket was never empty. Whenever we hit the last slice of bread, they'd swiftly come and switch out our basket. Our wine and water glasses were never left empty. They were prompt, polite, and gave excellent suggestions! THE FOOD: Chicken liver pate with pistachios/ So yummy and a generous serving to boot. They also gave us some mustard and an entire jar of yummy cornichons to eat with it. I dislike pickles but was converted after this. Quail with wild rice - perfectly cooked and generously portioned. I loved the presentation of it fanned out. Wild rice was cooked perfectly and salted well. I was stuffed after this but had to make space for :Blueberry tart - we asked our waiter for recommendations. He suggested the chocolate mousse or one of their specials, the blueberry tart. We opted for the latter and it was wonderful! Rich crust and a filling that wasn't too sweet. A perfect ending to a great dinner. They have a huge wine list and some half bottles listed as well, which was appreciated. We split a half bottle which thankfully left us alert enough to enjoy the dinner.

The wait staff was extremely attentive but not overbearing which is a hard balance to hit. I was pleased to note that although they are known for their wines that they also had beers on tap. I appreciated that the menu was translated into several languages. I would love to come back here when we return to Montreal

Service is also fast and they were very accommodating with a last minute reservation too.Price: more expensive than most meals but you're paying for quality here. It's definitely worth it.Ambiance: I love how classy and authentic this place is. It has an old school vibe that's reflected in both the cuisine, and design."
/user_details?userid=jyGzKoSIs-AStRX3NItM0Q,Neechi M.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Would probably give 3.5 stars if I could but 3 is too low. It was overall a good meal but with some issues:1) The beef tartare is the worst I've ever had and surprisingly they give a lot of it. I'm used to never having enough of it but instead we left a bunch on our plate. Not sure what the issue was. Perhaps it was a bit too warm, perhaps the meat was not high quality enough? Pass on this one.2) Hanger steak and frites was delicious. Would definitely order again, and it was cooked exactly how I asked for it. 3) If you are going at a busy time consider having a snack beforehand. The food took a good bit of time to come out so we ended up filling up on bread which made the meal less enjoyable when it finally came. Don't go here hungry and ready to eat immediately."

He said it was the best French bistro outside of France. It sure pays to chat with local bartenders!We were able to easily book a reservation online less than 24hours out for an early 5:30pm dinner.Our experience was one of the best dinners of our life. Accommodating to English speakers, the staff were so top notch and organized with bringing out our dishes and taking care of our requests including recommending some excellent wines to pair with our order.I loved how they brought out a large jar of cornichons to enjoy with your food, they went great with mustard and the pork rillette we ordered for an appetizer.We got one item from their daily specials that might have been the best dish of the meal - Fresh tomatoes with burrata cheese and pesto. We sopped up this dish with the bread L'Express provided!The entrees we ordered were the sea bass and hanger steak. The steak had a shallot butter on top that was outrageously good. The sea bass came with some perfectly cooked fresh green beans. Overall everything was fantastic.This really was a five star meal in every way. L'Express will be the first dining spot I'll recommend to anyone traveling to Montreal. Big thanks to Le A Bar for giving us this tip!"

I couldn't take this reason and it is so obvious that the shrimps are not fresh!  They told us they didn't charge us but we are not happy the explaination and attitude that they gave.

We sat in the front of the restaurant, but the back room looked cuter and had a sun roof and was less loud. We got the pork special appetizer, which came with the jar of tiny pickles. Delicious! Also got the celery remoulade - surprisingly refreshing. For the main we ordered the mushroom spaghetti and another special containing three different types of meat (sausage, pork, and a chicken drumstick) over a bed of seasoned beans and vegetable. The pasta was very tasty but the other entree was nothing too special. Waiter service was average as well. If you're looking for a casual lunch spot, it's a pretty quaint restaurant."

/user_details?userid=-od707p4FHGul0gte29AoQ,Nisha N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"**3.5**After much hype about this restaurant I made a reservation for Friday night. It was the first restaurant we went to on our weekend trip to Montreal. The restaurant by itself has a nice vibe to it, its a lively setting. We were seated immediately and started to place or orders. We had the bone marrow and foie gras for starters. I have to agree with one other reviewer when I say the quantity of the bone marrow was a lot, there were four of us at the table and we still had a tough time finishing it. Its a very rich dish and having too much of it killed the joy for me. It was my first time trying foie gras and I have to admit I did not like it, hence I can't really comment upon it. I had read about different styles in which it could be made and maybe I would have liked that more versus it being served just as is...Moving on the the main course, Mr. H had the chicken and said it was good, another friend had the risotto and loved it, one friend had the steak frites and had more to say regarding the frites vs. the steak. I had the quail and it was absolutely amazing! I dropped my fork and nibbled on it with my hands, out went the etiquette!For dessert we had the chocolate tart and it was fine. Overall the experience was a lot of ups and downs, for the price we paid it should have been awesome. I left a little disappointed and maybe next time I'll try another place.- The quail and the risotto were the highlights!"
/user_details?userid=5sH6Rcahm4R0CdXfSIdOOA,Candice H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Overall I had a pleasant experience here. But after reading reviews, I thought that the food would be better. The decor reminds you of a traditional French Bistro. Food 3.5/5:Surprisingly I really enjoyed their pickles and bread. Their pickles are delicious and the bread was soft and had a lovely crunchy crust.The appetizers were my least favourite; a little disappointing. We ordered to octopus salad. It was okay, but not something that I would order again. It was nicely presented and they gave you a lot of octopus, but I felt that it needed some more acid.We also ordered the chicken liver pistachio pate. We found this too rich for our liking, and the pistachio over powered the taste of the liver. We did enjoy our mains. i ordered the homemade ravioli, which was delicious. The pasta was delicate, and the gravy that the ravioli was covered in was delicious. The filling inside was tasty and a bit creamy. The mushrooms complimented the dish nicely, and gave the dish a bit of an earthy texture.My fiance ordered the shrimp risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly. The rice was creamy and the shrimp was perfect - not over cooked. The cherry tomatoes gave a nice acidic relief, from the creaminess of the sauce. I would definitely recommend that you try either of these dishes.For dessert we decided to get the Floating Island. It looked amazing with the sugar dome and the meringue inside and custard on the bottom. It was like a work of art. I can appreciate the difficulty of making the dessert. I enjoyed the almond praline the most. The meringue didn't have much taste other than sweetness. Overall the dessert was too sweet for my tastes, and a didn't live up to the presentation.Service 4.5/5 Service was excellent for the most part, until it came time to pay the bill, which was a bit slow. Our servers were pleasant and very efficient. When asked for recommendations they were quick to answer. They were also quick to clear our plates when we finished our dishes. Although it was busy, we didn't feel rushed and were able to take our time and enjoy our meal.The restaurant is quite popular, and we saw lots of locals.

/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"In Montreal, there is no shortage of wonderful eateries. Among the very best is L'express, serving up some of the city's tastiest French Bistro fare. It has become a destination that has yet to fail me and its array of savory options have left me hungry for more whenever I'm back in the states. It is a go-to for many, and a must for whenever I'm visiting.Adorned on the walls are photos from another time, a vintage peek into the old days when the establishment first made its name. The ambiance is festive without feeling touristy, the service is bustling yet wickedly efficient, and the decor is as simple as the faux-hand written menu.I'll just say it right now: Everything I've tried (so far) has been delightful. Granted I haven't had *everything* on the menu, the many things I have ordered were outstanding. Among the highlights for the appetizers include: quiche of the day (best is ham and cheese or broccoli and cheese), smoked Atlantic salmon, octopus + lentil salad vinegrette, the foie gras terrine, and of course, the bone marrow which was buttery, smooth, and sinfully delicious.From the beef tartare to the duck confit salad, their main courses are A+ from top to bottom. The pot-au-feu, or French beef stew, is a lovely and is delicious when paired with a great wine (ask the waiter). Few folks could argue against the roasted quail over wild rice or their homemade raviolis. My favorite so far has been hanger steak drenched in shallot butter and frites, a downright foodgasmic journey through a series of palate pleasing textures and flavor that my poor writing could never fully capture. If there are picky eaters in the group, shoot for the classic croque monsieur, or as they call it on the English portion of the menu, grilled cheese with ham. Even that is damn good, with mini chunks of juicy ham, and a gootastic mess of cheese that would even make lactose intolerant folks salivate.French fare, let alone the bistro kind rarely comes cheap. For the quality of some of the dishes noted above, the price merits the experience. And combined with all of the other indulging aspects of L'express, I can't recommend it enough with two thumbs up and post meal grins. You just have to experience it yourself.Je'taime, L'express."

Boy, this was a great dish with a super yummy truffled sauce and cooked root yet crunchy vegetables. I've tried boudin noir at a different restaurant the night before and that was a little off putting. Boudin Blanc here was fantastic, nothing I have eaten before. My other half ordered the mushroom ravioli. Also, a really hearty tasty dish. We decided to share the bone marrow. This was a very large portion, enough for four people!

Good thing my friends liked lentils so they finished that instead. The bone marrow was probably one of my favs.The hanger steak was good, but the tartare steak was a disappointment; it just tasted like just any other steak.Service was also a hit and miss. It took about 10 minutes for someone to finally come over (and that's after we waved someone over...I know, disrespectful on my end) to take our order.Again, considering the price we paid, I probably won't go back.

They did forget one of our appetizers but that's okay and they got it out asap.As for the food I must say it was nothing extraordinary and I didn't feel it was worth the price tag. I posted photos of all the dishes we bought and out of them the ones we thought were on the better side were: shrimp risotto, hangar steak, quail and the fish soup. The escargot and the os de moelle honestly were the most disappointing. Escargot was nothing special and the bone marrow was drenched in grease. If that's how it was supposed to be then I don't know why anyone would order it. The ravioli also had too much sauce, and the chicken breast was dry (as expected). The grilled salmon was also very disappointing. I guess if I would choose one dish to recommend it would be the shrimp risotto."

The tables by the window would be what I consider the prime seats, as the natural light coming in was very nice contrast against the black & white tiled floors and deep red walls. The beet salad was possibly the best one I've ever had- many different kinds/colors of beets and surprisingly a few carrot and mushroom bits thrown in for fun- but what really delighted me was that the slivers of cheese on top were slightly warmed. The quail over wild rice was very tender, though it could have used some more salt or seasoning (I added). Profiteroles with maple ice cream in creme anglaise was a great end to the meal and didn't feel heavy.

Downside was that lunch menu doesn't start until 11:30AM on weekends, so ordering at 11:15AM means your choices are mostly just bread and eggs.

/user_details?userid=pEMWzZ8qWY1T_K0HUoKDIA,Hope C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Have been holding back on this review for a few weeks because I was disappointed at the time and wanted to consider the meal again from a distance. It was painfully average: the ambiance, the service and the food itself. L'Express had been recommended to me previously by a lovely couple I'd met in Montreal a couple of years prior. A woman at a bar in Toronto also mentioned it in passing. Two random recommendations for a restaurant in the Plateau Mont-Royal area? I was sold.The area is uber-trendy, bustling and vibrant. L'Express has been a fixture in the neighborhood for decades, priding itself on classic French bistro fare. Maybe this is why I was surprised that the mood inside was dated and stale. It lacked the energy of the nearby restaurants. There's something to be said about tradition, but there's also something to be said about being flexible and revamping yourself over time. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer to start - always oily but perhaps not enough flair on this dish. Maybe flavored salt or some other garnish would have elevated it. Normally you can't go wrong with salt & fat on crusty bread, but it was banal in creation. It needed more. For our main, we split the hangar steak and frites. There's nothing more traditional about this standard bistro dish - and although the frites were fresh, the steak was on the chewy side. With every bite I tried to reconcile and defend it, but I couldn't get past the number of times I had to chew and chew and chew. Medium rare and difficult to choke down.The creme brûlée dessert was flawless and the wine (Pinot noir and Bordeaux) complemented the meal nicely. It took a little bit longer than expected to obtain the bill.Overall, this was probably a case of unrealistic expectations that colored an experience that could have gone two ways: viewing the restaurant as a stalwart that pays homage to the classics of French bistro dining, or being disappointed by a traditional giant that has failed to progress with the creativity of its neighbors. I'm sad to say the latter was my take, but I'd still go back in the hopes of finding the magic of convention."

They do have menus in French and English but the one in English doesn't have prices on it. The food was meh. We ordered bone marrow, foie gras, oysters, country soup, fish soup, quail, steak tartare and pork. The bone marrow and foie gras were greasy. I am not a fan of those dishes. Oysters was fresh and tasty. Country soup was ok. Fish soup was kinda watery and weak. For the main dishes, the steak tartare was my fav. It was nicely flavored and the fries came with it were crispy and good. My friend like the quail. The sauce mixed with rice was good. The pork was recommended by the waiter but it was not as good as I expected. The pork itself was tender but the sauce is not that good.

Nevertheless they are always kind, helpful and some of them have a fun pleasant sense of humor as well. They bring a jar of pickles to every table and leave it there for you to munch over. The food tastes great and the portions are what you'd expect of a french restaurant. I've tried the ravioli, the steak, the liver, the risotto... And a few of their desserts. My fav dessert so far is the white chocolate pistachio brulee :) it's a great place to treat a friend who's visiting, or just to catch up with an old friend over excellent food"

/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"This well established classic French bistro was opened in 1979 by a young couple who were frustrated that they couldn't get a good bite to eat after working long hours in the theatre. The concept was simple, provide delicious and affordable meals to everybody all the time.Their vision still holds true today as opening hours are from 8am to 2am on most days of the week. So next time you are out late and hungry, forget about poutine and greasy Chinese food, swing by l'Express! Classic French bistro food doesn't get better than this!We ordered for starters the bone marrow and octopus salad. Bone marrow was melt in your mouth buttery good. Octopus was very refreshing and well cooked but nothing out of the ordinary.For mains we had the raviolis - simply outstanding, bursting with flavour from the pork and mushroom filling- and the roasted quail - wow again, cooked to perfection, crispy skin, well seasoned.For dessert we tired the 'ile flottante' - huge serving of very well whipped meringue topped with an almond brittle. All in all, if I lived in the area I'd be going every week!"

Bone marrow is great, their French fries are excellent and I loved the salmon with beurre blanc sauce.

/user_details?userid=T2KRQSCZFXpj925mpNe1Hg,Elizabeth L.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"I'll start the review by saying I enjoyed the food and the star review doesn't reflect that. But... There were live ants in one of our bread trays! We didn't make a fuss, because I think we all weren't the type, but we did call the waiter over and pointed it out and asked him to remove that tray of bread. We also stayed and ordered partly because we were in shock, and partly because we don't like fusses and it would be strange to walk out of the restaurant. And partly because we were hungry (it's hard to make rational decisions when hungry and near food) and figured it was probably a one time deal (it was. We checked all the rest of the bread bowls and no ants). The waiter took away the bread bowl quickly... And the situation wasn't brought up again. We got our food. It was pretty tasty. It wasn't the best I've ever had but probably a solid 4 stars at least if I didn't have ants on the brain. The service was slow between dinner and dessert, but I think that's because it was peak dinner time (~7:30pm). The waitstaff was quite polite. We had two main servers, and one was extremely nice and attentive with the water. The white chocolate and pistachio creme brulee was delicious btw. Credit where credit is due. And we paid and left... And now I'm writing this because I think we should have received more... something for the presence of live insects in our food. There was perhaps a quick apology as it was whisked away, but that was it. Did the waiter even let the manager know? I would have appreciated the manager coming over and apologizing. I would have really appreciated having our wine or dessert comped. I am frustrated that, since I'm not someone who likes to kick up a fuss, the situation was poorly handled. I guess I learned my lesson."

Throughout the meal, the service was fantastic and very attentive. Every unused dish was picked up swiftly, the empty bread baskets were quickly replaced with full ones. The only time they forgot something was when asked for Parmesan for the pasta dish - my partner had to ask twice. Also, this pasta dish was the only vegetarian main on the menu, and was just OK according to her. This is not a good place for vegetarians - but the rest of us had the best meal ever:We started with bone marrow (Yammi! cooked just right) and then moved to the chicken pate (good). These are very good dishes to split three-way (you get three bones).  For the mains we had the veal kidney in mustard sauce (fantastic, rich meat flavours), the hunger steak with fries (as expected, simple but good steak and good fries), and the shrimp risotto (yammi!). For dessert we shared the signature desert (ill folttante with caramel) - this one looks great and it's an instagrammer's dream. it's fine for the pallet as well. However, the surprise desert of the evening was the coffee cream brule - well executed classic french with a twist. We let our waiter know how much we liked it and he told us that he agrees that it is great, but they change the flavour every two weeks. Last week's tea flavour was not as good in his opinion... To sum up - very nice evening. Book ahead."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Cleanliness: 3.5/5Price: $$$The restaurant definitely needs a reservation - it's rather small and can only accommodate so many customers at once. L'Express has a large history behind the restaurant which can be seen on its restaurant walls: It seems that the restaurant group takes a wall portrait. The pictures date back to early 1980s which really surprised me.The menu at L'Express is rather small - the three columns are in French / English / and Spanish or Italian ... I can't figure out the last column. Anyway, the prices are not listed on the menu so ask your waiter for prices, or have a look online on their website.This is what we ordered:Me:Appetizer: Country Style Soup (Minestrone)Main: Shrimp RisottoHubby:Appetizer: Bone Marrow with Coarse SaltMain: Veal Kidney in Mustard SauceHubby took recommendations from our waiter who eagerly recommended the bone marrow and veal kidney as my husband is quite an adventurous eater. I would've loved to join him, but I decided to be safe and stick to shrimp risotto as I was pregnant.After ordering, we were brought out condiments. Each table had a huge jar of cornichons (or are they gherkins?) which we were a little puzzled about at first. With no instructions on how or what to eat it with, we just waited until our appetizers arrived.Hubby's bone marrow looked so appetizing! He definitely had a side of cornichons as well :D, and with the baked crostini, he told me that the bone marrow was delicious! Oh how I wish I could've had a bite! We thought the portions of bone marrow were very generous, as we had ordered bone marrow elsewhere and its portions were not very big at all, only bite size. It was our first restaurant (so far) that served whole pieces.My minestrone soup was nothing out of the ordinary, but I really enjoyed it as I was pretty cold from the outside Winter weather (remember this was back in January). The soup definitely hit the spot and I finished the entire bowl without sharing with my husband :P. I was surprised at myself because I don't normally enjoy minestrone (I prefer creamier soups) but at L'Express, it was beyond my expectations.Hubby's veal kidney arrived not too much later and at first, hubby enjoyed it very much. However, towards the end of his main dish, I think he was having a bit of trouble trying to finish it. It was creamier than we had expected, and the kidney were fattier portions of the veal. It truly was a French dish! The potatoes were definitely helpful in balancing the fattier flavours of the dish, but I don't think they were enough.My shrimp risotto was delicious! The tables next to me kept looking over at my shrimp risotto... it was that good! The flavours were very well balanced and overall very flavourful! We couldn't really tell what the sauce consisted of but it's definitely worth reordering! It had generous portions of shrimp and other vegetables as well which I appreciated.I'm a sucker for profiteroles and I'm always drawn to ordering them whenever I see them on the menu! The profiteroles at L'Express were heavenly, literally. It was so good that I had to stop myself to ordering another plate of them. The profiteroles were perfectly baked with a caramelized top- crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside while still being warm! The cold ice cream went perfectly with it and oh my goodness it really was heavenly. If you love sweet caramel like me, you'd definitely enjoy this dessert!Overall, our dinner at L'Express was a very enjoyable one. I wish we had visited the restaurant earlier during our time in Montreal- we would've definitely been regulars! The service was slightly spotty - the restaurant was so crowded and busy that it took some time to get a hold of a waiter and put in our order. But the waiter that was in charge of our table was very friendly and helpful, and definitely didn't forget about us throughout our night. The restaurant, in my opinion, could've been a little cleaner, but with the wet winter weather and the number of customers in the restaurant, I think L'Express did a decent job of keeping the restaurant tidy and clean amidst everything.In the end, our bill came to something near what we would pay at a higher priced ($$$) restaurant. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it wasnt anything outrageously expensive for the quality of food and experience we just enjoyed. We would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone - those visiting Montreal, locals looking for a new restaurant, those going out on a romantic date, family reunions, for late night eats especially as it's open until 2-3am! It's going to feel like you are transported to France for an authentic French meal."

The menu had all the choices you'd expect with a couple of fish options. A couple of chicken and a few off the cuff type like calf liver and veal kidney. The wine list was quite vast with a wide range of price points. We chose a 60$ Riesling bottle which was a good tasting wine. But they thought is was acceptable to serve at room temperature expecting us to enjoy a first glass semi warm while we waited for it to chill in the bucket of ice. The other issue we had with our experience is with a entrée price of 25$-30$ it was sub par quality. It looked like something that could be made at home with a sloppy presentation. Average flavour. I had the sea bass and my wife the lobster risotto. The dessert we asked what they recommended, which was the apple tart. When we dove into it, it seemed like a piece that was left uncovered in the back of fridge for a week or two. The apples were this weird dark jelly on top and then more standard underneath. Flavour nothing special.I wouldn't recommend this from our experience."

Called Sunday morning and was only able to get a 10pm reservation at L'express but we took it and we're glad we did. First, definitely make a reservation in advance. We figured it would be empty at 10 on a Sunday but it was completely packed. Started with the octopus salad. Perfect starter. Moved on to the foie gras terrine. It was rich, creamy and decadent. As foie gras should be. We moved on to the cured ham plate which was okay, could've done without.  Finally we had the duck confit salad and the ravioli. The ravioli was OUTSTANDING. We regretted not having enough room to scarf all of them down. They were rich and delicious. Definitely order them. The duck confit salad, eh. The duck had quite a gamey taste and just paled in comparison to the ravioli. Our waiter recommended a half bottle of Bordeaux which paired perfectly to our dishes. The service was excellent, the ambience was cool - not too loud and appropriately trendy. We would definitely return on our next trip to Montreal."

I was on the hunt for the most traditional french cuisine I can find. I came across this French bistro called L'Express Montreal, and what stood out for me is I can have all my sinful french favorites in this traditional bistro.I walked down a trendy street of Rue-Saint Denis after getting off the Sherbrooke Station. After a brief walk I realized I have passed the entrance of the restaurant. I walked back and when I opened the door, I realized that I should've booked a reservation. I find it hard to request for a table. Table for one please.My first impression is how old times mannerisms are kept here. A lady patron that walked in before me gave the front of house manager a kiss on the cheek; one on each side, and then he proceeded to take her jacket to hang. I was lucky enough to get the very last corner seat at the bar (as hopeful patrons without reservations are told to wait at least 45 minutes.) Phew!I sat down and before ordering they serve bread and butter. Since I already made up my mind I selected the following.Boiled Egg with Mayonnaise (oeuf dur mayonnaise) 4.70: No thrills, a classic french snack starting with a boiled egg, covered in a coat of rich mayonnaise with strong hint of dill.Bone Marrow with Coarse Salt (os à moelle gros sel) 14.85: My goodness, for 15 bucks you get three generous servings of bone marrow. You are not going to break the spoon here trying to scrape for marrow. Guaranteed that you will get a rich portion every single time. The marrow is rich and heavy. It is more of a texture indulgence than taste.To accompany this, they serve unlimited gherkins straight from the jar as a side snack to cut the richness. Sea salt and mustard to enhance the flavor. Warm Goat Cheese Salad (chèvre chaud) 13.35: How can you be in Montreal and not try their cheese. Warm goat cheese on brioche with a light green salad.Chicken Liver Pate with Pistachios (Mousse de Foues de Volaille aux Pistaches) 14.75: To finally put you to sleep. We are writing this riding the subway back to the hotel, is this rich pate! Don't let the small size fool you. They are not holding back. Imagine spreading this over the top rich chicken liver pate on your bread over and over... and over again. The Pistachios is a classic accompaniment as it adds a different texture to the spread. I think I gained 10 lbs from this alone! But it was so worth it!Overall, this is for someone that wants to experience traditional french bistro dishes. I would bet that they haven't changed a thing in this restaurant since the opening. And that is not a bad thing. Not at all!"

I finally settled on a poached salmon dish, which didn't come with much¸ ( $24.95) small chunk of salmon with chevril tinted mashed potatos. whoopie! Desserts go for a whopping $10.00 per pastry, coffee extra, of course. Since, I already had my sugar fill that day, I passed, but my companions said the desserts were so/so, with the exception of the apple/berry hot pudding. Nice to have revisited the place after so long a time, but that's it for me, dream's over."

It was like a trip to Paris only in N America.We were on a family vacation, and I remembered an Anthony Bourdain episode where he ate here. I checked the Yelp reviews and made a reservation, which I highly recommend as far in advance as you know.Everything was wonderful, appetizers, salad, and entrees. A few bottles of wine and a lot of money, but worth it for a true Montreal experience."

First, the service was great. The waiters explained the menu in detail and took their time, answered our questions. The dessert menu is not in English, and the waiter explained the entire menu for us.The fish soup was flavorful. It was kind of like lobster bisque just rougher in texture and less creamy (hence the soup, not bisque). The stale bread crusted with dry melted cheese it came with actually paired pretty well. The raviolis and quail with wild rice I think had the same sauce (veal stock), which was nice. Just wish we didn't get both because it just seemed repetitive. Raviolis, if five of them were stacked, I would have loved it but then it wouldn't be a ravioli. Quail was cooked so nicely. Both the leg and breast were tender and juicy, and the wild rice added interesting firm texture to each bite.The floating island dessert - We didn't like it at all. An interesting looking dessert with boring taste. It was just sweet. It just tasted like candy. Ate one third of it and wanted to say something.So overall, we had a pretty good meal with great service with some standouts and some fallouts.But for the price, I could have had a better meal. A solid 3.5 stars."

The waiter was very curt but efficient and he knew that we're tourists, so he handed us the English menu.We started with:Fish soup - really rich and thick which was not what I was expecting but it was quite enjoyable. It came with 4 pieces of cheese encrusted baquette which was a tad bit chewy. Overall, it was good and quite a big portion as a starter. I was pretty much good kind of full after finishing my bowl of soup.Octopus and lentil salad - my fiancé loved this dish, it was a well balanced flavour, texture and acidity. It was again a pretty big portion but tasty!As our main we had:Onglet (steak frites) - I ordered my hangar steak medium rare and it was quite tasty with the compound butter. The fries was really good too, but after the appetizer I only had room for the steak. My fiancé loved the steak!Duck confit salad - The duck was shredded on a bed of greens, and you get a good portion of the duck. It was a nice balanced dish.Overall, my fiancé and I will be back, and perhaps share an appetizer instead of ordering one per person."

In addition, he also helped us with clear directions.Food - 4.5/5The appetizers and entrees were simply excellent. Our Bone Marrow arrived with nice little leaves covering the marrow and crunchy toasted bread. The scallops were also delicious. Consume them fast however. Our entrees Shrimp Risotto and Duck Confit Salad were heavenly. The risotto was generously portioned and disappeared in our mouths within minutes. I had some trepidation initially with the duck confit salad, but the second I ate some, I was hooked. Crispy duck bits populate a bed of fresh greens, creating a unique and flavorful taste.The only knock was the dessert- the flottante. I no longer have the sweet tooth that I possessed while younger and the caramelized exterior was just too much for us. But the interior was delicious.Bottom line- Go Go Go."

/user_details?userid=4Eaenf_bC7_T95j7wO2r8g,Chi L.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"From south of the customs and a French cuisine virgin, so I can't say I was used to the experience. Service was slow as first, but did pick up. My understanding is that each table had a waiter and server. The way dinner worked was that you got your menu, ordered appetizers, ate, table cleared, got the menu, ordered main course and so on, and repeat again for dessert. This led to a long wait time that no one in our party was used to/prepared for. (Not to mention the name of the restaurant led us to think this would be a fast meal.) I struggled to not use my phone... I assume that's what ""No SVP"" meant with the image below it on the corner of the menu.Onto the food:For appetizer, we had the smoked salmon, bone marrow with coarse salt, sorrel soup, and the ""country style"" soup. The country style soup was a vegetable soup.The soups tasted great. The veggie soup was loaded and tasted of the vegetables. The sorrel soup was thick, rich -and sour! Wonderful! The smoked salmon was good, lightly smoked. The bone marrow was mediocre, however. Rich, but flavourless. Turns out we were suppose to apply the salt at our own discretion. A little salt goes a long way for bone marrow, but given how small a piece of bone marrow is, applying salt ourselves meant it was easily over salted.For main course, we had the calf liver and the hangar steak. The liver came with your choice of side, which was spinach for us. It was well cooked, not tough and dry as I'd feared from childhood horrors of eating livers. The steak was topped with shallot butter and came with well-fried(over fried? Double fried? It was darker than usual after spending extra time in the oil.) fries. The steak was good but not great, chewier than what I'd expected and could be over seasoned for some. The fries were good but the dipping sauce wasn't to my liking. I was later told that steak isn't really a French thing. I wish I was told earlier. I was hoping to try bouillabaisse but that was not on the menu.So what does being from the States have to do with any of this? Would the same not apply to someone from Ontario or BC?Well, not knowing local initials, when the bill came, below the subtotal were lines for T.P.S. and T.V.Q.(I very likely don't have the initials right either) which our party had thought meant the tips were included. You know, tips and tax both started with a T. With that idea, we didn't leave much behind, but it was more than a quarter (Yeap, I know about the quarter)Turns out the two lines were for two taxes - federal and provincial. Nope, this is not done in California or Vermont or anywhere else in the US- or anywhere in general for that matter- that we've been to. So, yeah, the waiter and server from Thursday night, sorry.Someone get back to me if I've got something wrong."

The portion was perfect for sharing and all the mixed favors does good on a pallet. Entree - Baked quail with Quail eggs and wild rice.....delicious.

The wait staff was nice and helpful. What we initially noticed was the wine list. Having a few options for under $30 which is almost unheard of. We started with a warm goat cheese salad which was a nice start. I wouldn't say it was the best salad I've ever had BUT it was a nice french start. The pickles and bread they put on the table are a delicious touch. For mains we ordered a croque monsieur and the bavette. They came with a healthy portion of fries. We both enjoyed these mains. The croque monsieur was as buttery as you'd expect from a french restaurant. The steak was good with a compound butter. For dessert, we decided to get a creme caramel. It was quite delicious. The french version of a flan is quite nice and light. Overall, it was a nice meal, wouldn't say it was exceptional but its worth checking out. Not the cheapest meal, however, and this is why I rate this a 3."

/user_details?userid=gn9g8qkDvi7qUXQGtlQeBA,Mack M.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This is the best restaurant ever.We've come to Montreal twice, eaten here twice on both visits, and wherever we travel, we compare every good restaurant to L'Express.I don't want to hype your expectations, but if you come here, simply expecting a nice meal with good service at a not-so-high price, you will have a good time. You may want to come back again, and you should. Because when you leave Montreal, maybe not the first week after, maybe not the first year after, you may very well find yourself comparing restaurants in your home town - or in other cities you travel - to L'Express.There are fancier / hipper / I don't know what. If ever a restaurant could make you want to move to a city, L'Express is that restaurant. Because you could afford to eat here regularly, you would want to become a regular, and just the thought makes me want to pack up my life and learn to speak Quebecois! But, like you, I have a real life far off in another city.So make L'Express your home base while in Montreal. Come for brunch one day, dinner another. If you are so lucky as to have a third meal here . . .

Everything here thrilled me. I love that this is a nice French place, but it is not pretentious. The atmosphere is upscale casual, emphasis on the casual. Our waiter was very attentive and was happy to answer our questions. The service, from the host, to the waiter, to the busers, was spot on throughout the night. We started with the special mushroom tart, which we split, and it was everything a good tart should be. The pastry was buttery and flaky, with that great browned taste. The cheese was savory, but subtle, and the mushrooms were an excellent balance to the rest of the tart. For mains, I had the house made ravioli, which has pork and veal with a mushroom glaze. The waiter did make sure that I was okay doubling up on mushroom dishes, which was a nice catch, but I was happy to have both and the flavors were distinctly different. The boyfriend had the special lobster risotto. The raviolis were incredible, the pasta was doughy and tender, the filling was so flavorful and savory, and the mushroom glaze was to die for. It had this deep, earthy flavor and I sopped up the rest with the amazing crusty bread. The lobster risotto was an excellent summery counterpoint. From what I saw on the boyfriend's plate and tried, the flavors were light, the lobster was generous, and he was practically licking his plate even though he said it was very filling. For dessert we split the chocolate tart. Of course the tart was a dense, intensely chocolatey experience, but the dark chocolate sauce that adorned it really made the dish. It was so dark and a little bit bitter that it made the tart even better. The crust was nice and thin, so it held together and had a nice butter flavor, but didn't get in the way. I ate here two days ago and I am still raving about it. It is not to be missed in Montreal."

The bartender was our main service contact; he was pleasant and attentive, without invading our privacy or pressuring us to hurry up (even as the restaurant filled up).  Overall, I got to try something on my foodie wish list (steak tartare!) and we got to experience L'Express at the last minute, without a reservation...you couldn't wish for more, given our lack of planning.  I think if I got to try out the whole normal sit-down experience, going all out with wine, appetizers, and whatnot, that L'Express would definitely be a 5-star visit."

Trying the Ile Flottante with caramel is a must. The chocolate tart (made with 70% from Tanzania) was about the best I've ever had. Lemon tart was smooth, balanced in flavor, and topped with a sumptuous dollop of white chocolate ganache. There's something for every budget on the wine list. Old fashioned French brasserie atmosphere and service in Montreal. Try it, you won't regret it."

First thing you notice walking in is the trademark black & white square tiles. Feels very French-bistro-y (for lack of better descriptive).I was less than impressed with the food for the prices. Presentation was lacking, although quality was there. My favourite was the duck confit salad by far. Bone marrow was too much for one person, there were barely any escargots in my escargot dishes (would have been better renamed to escargot flavoured sauce), and the ravioli portion was too small... Otherwise, the octopus was amazing, lentils were okay.Definitely try if you have time (and the money), some people love it and find it very authentic.

It's a huge portion the capers really added flavor to it. Oh, and that home made ravioli...amazing. Bad : It's a bit on the pricy side, but then again it's not your average 12 am food spot.

The warm goat cheese salad and the duck rillette were great appetizers. The bread was perfectly chewy and crunchy, and the classic Montreal spread with the jar of gherkins and mustard were surprisingly delicious.

When we arrived, the place was bustling and there were a good number of people waiting to be seated. Our table took a little while to be ready for us, but we only waited 10 mins max.Along the walls are a ton of photos dating back to the 1970s, when L'express began. If a business has made it this far, it's good in my book. We ordered 2 half bottles of 2007 Bordeaux ($16 each), and started off with Bone Marrow and Foie Gras apps. We then ordered the duck confit salad, hanger steak frites, sea bass, and quail for our mains. The foie gras was nommalicious - I am a foie gras FIEND. MORE MORE MORE! It also came with a bucket of pickles that my friend could not stop eating (Hi Anita! :P) The bone marrow was pretty good too, but I have had better in NYC. The hanger steak was on par with normal steak frites. The duck confit was de-skinned and de-boned, which was disappointing because I was looking forward to that crunchy duck skin - but the meat was extremely flavorful. The sea bass was melt in yo'mouth. And this leaves the quail... OMG the QUAIL! So freaking good. Please do yourself a favor and get it. Amazeballs.Such a huge fan of L'express! Perfect service, great food."

My boyfriend and I ordered 6 oysters, bone marrow (my gawd...holy...so good), and steak tartare, with side of fries for me salad for him. I read on this blog that their beef tartare was one of the top places to order this dish. I was not disappointed. It had a nice spicy kick with capers and other dreamy stuff. The oysters were divine, and the bone marrow, which was my first time eating it was crazy good. It was so rich I swear I think I wanted to cry from its super delicious-ness. Definitely try their bone marrow for appetizer and definitely order their beef tartare. It was seriously good. Recommend recommend! Come by this restaurant if you are in the plateau area. It is really close to Sherbrooke metro, I would say 5-10 min walk. Great neighborhood too. As for pricing, well it's French food for you, so don't expect to come in paying less than 25-30 bucks.

From the get go, we were greeted by the host, a very kind gentleman who happily lead us to our table. Right away, my boo and I ordered glasses of beers while we enjoyed some bread and gherkins and waited to place our orders. We ordered our wine (Le St. Chinian), entrées -- both got onglets done medium rare. The cuts were small according to my partner (he's a big boy = big appetite) but I thought it was perfection. The fries were divine as well, while my boy got mashed potatoes (he has a peanut allergy and they do deep fry their fries in peanut oil) which he thoroughly enjoyed. Everything was beyond delicious but my favourite part was definitely dessert. We got the cheese cake and I honestly believe that it is the best cheese cake I have ever eaten in my life. That and my cappuccino and we had ourselves a perfect evening over a delicious, unforgetful meal. The service was prompt and very friendly, yet remained very professional. I honestly have no complaints about L'Express. The only one thing I have to say is why is it so good? I have to go back sooner than later now! haha!

I felt like the price of the foie gras did not match up to my expectations - that is my only complaint. The highlights were clearly the entrees!

L'Express is by far one of the best French bistros in Montreal and well worth paying them a visit if you have not already had the pleasure. Reservations are highly recommended as this place is almost always packed - and they close at 2am!Tucked away on St. Denis, this place can be a little tricky to find (no sign) and locals probably like it this way. Like the name of the restaurant, the décor of L'Express has the feel of old French train car. A long copper bar, black and white checkered floor, and a few potted palm trees really adds to the ambiance of a Parisian bistro from days long gone. Tables are close together, so expect noise levels to be energetic, which in my opinion, adds to the bistro's joie de vivre environment.   I've been coming here for few years now and the menu pretty much seems to stay the same with the exception of some daily specials (For Anglophones, there is an English version upon request). Some of their staple dishes we ordered were the bone marrow appetizer, which was perfectly textured (think meat-flavored pudding), steak tartare, had just the right amount seasonings, sauté de canard confit, and my favorite, pot-au-feu - all really incredibly delicious! Lol, I really think though, it's all about the jar of cornichons period. Wine was beautifully paired, at the suggestion of our waiter, with a bottle of Pessac-Leognan 2008 Grand Vin de Bordeaux. Service was unpretentious and exceptional as always. The waiters work along with assistant waiters and have their service down to science.

Most people return for the experience - the restaurant is known for being really classic and old school, not super modern or pretentious and I think that's what why they have such a loyal customer following.

My dish was good, didn't quite blow me away I think there wasn't enough flavor or variety to it. However the homemade raviolis came out and my husband looked at them like ""what the f*** is this"" because it wasn't Italian.  However one bite quickly changed his mind as they were melt in your mouth good. A little salty for the dish.If I had known there there was a counter I would've requested a table in our reservation but the best English speaking employee the bartender who was very nice was there. Again to my disappointment my husband made me skip dessert so our meal came out quite cheap. I would say if you are sitting at the counter it's definitely a more casual vibe but at the tables it seemed a bit more upscale. Can't wait to come back on our next visit and get an appetizer and dessert in!"

The service was very attentive as well as helpful. Our waiter made a few suggestions before we ordered and they were on point. I started with the bone marrow appetizer and i must say i didn't know what to expect having never had this before. The flavor was sweet, almost smokey. I loved it, but the texture took some getting used to.  For my entree i ordered the steak tartar (another recommendation) and it was phenomenal! Extremely flavorful and an extremely generous portion. I would actually recommend ordering this as an appetizer for the table as i couldn't finish the dish myself.       If you make it to Montreal,  this is a must!"

We stopped in around 8pm on a Friday and they were totally booked up but said they might have space at the bar in an hour. We went somewhere else for a drink and came back and were sat around 9:15.We ordered a nice bottle of red wine and asked the waiter for some recommendations. He suggested the onglet and the chestnut salad as a starter. Both things I probably wouldn't have ordered.I absolutely loved the chestnut salad. Fantastic! My friend was obsessed with the onglet.I would love to come back and try a few other things on the menu.

Upon entering, one senses that they have entered a special and iconic place. Traveling alone, I made a reservation for the bar. I assumed that I would just be placed at the bar when there was an opening. I was wrong. I arrived to find a table setting for me, a place mat and a card saying ""reserved"" at the space designated for me at the bar. It was a special way to begin the meal. The bartenders and waiters were exactly what I would expect at a French restaurant, and very attentive. The soup came in a beautiful bowl and accompanied by cheese bread slices. I chose the steak frites for my entree. The meat was succulent, juicy and able to be cut with a fork. The fries were crunchy, salty and perfection. I normally don't order hanger steak and fries, but I'm so happy that I did. It's the best I've ever had or could hope to have again.The wine list too is substantial and reasonable options exist. The prices are incredibly reasonable for such a nice experience, with most entrees in the $15 to $25 range."

There's a small list of dishes to choose from so you can quickly decide. Your order will arrive accordingly swiftly. They haven't changed their small menu for as long as I can remember but what they do have, they manage to do it well. And it's always pleasant to drop in for a quick bite. Think of a ""diner"" experience with much better and cleaner food that's well put together. Their meats can be overlooked. And that's often the problem when I go. But everything on their menu is solid. Take a look at the menu before you go. If there's anything you're in the mood for, this place is sure to satiate it."

The restaurant is the shape of a train cart almost, with mostly small 2 person tables. The crowd is local and diverse: we sat near an old priss-and-proper couple sharing a romantic meal, napkins tucked into collar and all. we also bordered a pair of hip gay guys with asymetrical hair-dews and sexy auras. I'd recommend dressing up a bit, but if you aren't, it's not pretentious. Also, it is open until VERY late, which totally fits my style. We saw people mozy in at midnight, welcomed to a full menu! If you going to get wine, I recommend the half bottle, it's very 'Montreal' to do, and a bit cheaper.As far as food recommendations, the ***bone marrow*** dish had me considering cannibalism for months afterward, every passing human reminded me of the fatty guk that I had dug out of those luscious bones! It comes with these really crunchy pieces of toast that combine perfectly with the marrow's texture. While the sea salt seemed like a good idea to sprinkle on at first, I soon realized that it overpowered the bone marrow which is perfectly fine on its own, so keep that in mind.What I love about this place is the subtlety of its facade. There is no sign directly on it but instead its name is on the ground in the black and white tiles right before you enter. (See the picture I posted) This is one of those reviews I write hoping secretly that no one will read it, since I do want this gem to remain a gem, but if you love that French bistro feel and you don't mind forking over the extra $ for the ride, then you really should hurry over and enjoy it!"

Wonderful experience. We shared the rilettes l'express (chicken pate), octopus and lentil salad and warm goat cheese salad for our starters. Chicken pate came with a slice of dried apricot on it and was absolutely delicious and flavourful. The octopus was tender and the warm goat cheese salad was sublime. All three dishes were very rich and filling and probably enough for us but we were greedy and ordered a main- the chicken in lemon and sage sauce. Probably the moistest chicken breast I have ever had, the sauce was amazing too. Food came fast, service was impeccable. The cost of our meal was unbelievably reasonable, including bottle of wine- 50 bucks per person! Would 100% come back here the next time I visit Montreal!"

It's a French nursery dessert, a meringue topped with vanilla custard, and the presentation is a lovely end to your meal.For what you get, it's an incredibly fairly priced restaurant -- you can get a glass of good wine for $5, for example, which I thought was quite cheap.

The minute you step into the restaurant it is as if you are transported to Paris of the 1920's. The decor is classic bistro with dim lighting and old world feel. The waiters wear vests and clean white aprons and greet everyone with warmth. You just know you are going to be taken care of. Everyone's food at the table looked delicious, but I wasn't able to take a bit before their dishes were already half finished, so I can only comment on my own food. I had the shrimp risotto. This is not exactly French, but the French version of an Italian classic. The risotto was perfectly cooked with just enough bite to the rice to not make you feel like you are eating baby food. The shrimp were delicious and fit the saffron infused rice perfectly. As for dessert, I was able to sneak more than one bite off of everyone else's plate. ;) My rum baba came in what seemed like a pool of simple syrup. This made me worried because I do not enough overly sweet desserts. However, the syrup was balanced, not overly sweet or rum-y. The cake itself was almost egg bread life and soaked up the syrup wonderfully. The chocolate tart was the MOST AMAZING chocolate tart ever! Think dark, bitter sweet, creamy, rich and buttery. Good, right? Well, multiply that by 100 and this is what this tart tasted like. I would come back to just have this tart again."

The service was more efficient than polite.  Nothing to make you feel unwanted, but nothing to give you that friendly feeling either.  However, it was very quick and prompt.  It could have been because our table was reserved for 8:15 (which they told us twice) and they wanted to get rid of us quick, but the service was very fast.  Which is a huge plus. The complimentary bread was absolutely delicious.  Not warm, but super fresh.  I got the steak and fries, which I now realize is my usual order at a french place.  The steak was pretty good, the fries were golden and crispy, really good.  For dessert I got a lemon tart (though it was called something else in french).  Not the regular watered down taste, super lemony, so I was a huge fan!

We booked our tickets for the bus ride and embarked on our trek to the bigger city! I tried really hard to get reservations to Au Pie du Cochon because of Anthony Bourdain. After relentless attempts, we were not able to get in! This is where Yelp helps! Looking at the myriad of restaurants, we made our way to L' Express without reservations, we walked in and were able to get a table but needed to be out by 7 because someone was smart enough to reserve a table. We were nicely greeted with a humongo jar of tiny pickles and bread,  boy were those pickles nice and sour! I started with the duck confit salad, it was excellent, with nice tender pieces of slow cooked duck meat cooked in its own fat. I then proceeded with the bone marrow. I was in heaven as my plate made its way, there were enough bones to feast the eyes! The marrow was succulent ad seasoned just right. Slather them bad boys on some toasted baguettes and you just died and gone to heaven! To drink, we tried the house local blonde which was amazing!All in all, I am glad that we stopped in, I think you will be too!"

/user_details?userid=3ybJXMA4RarhAqtO8Dv6MA,Lara W.,"Stanford, CA",5 star rating,"A Montreal gem.The cool thing about this French restaurant is that it really feels like a Parisian bistro, which many travelers are shocked to discover is NOT standard in Montreal.  Yes people, Montreal and Paris are on two very distant continents and no, Montrealers are not baguette toting Frenchmen.But this place might have you fooled, if you want to continue thinking that you drove up from Boston to visit France.  Please leave your redsox hat at the door though: the place is chic. Hard to spot from the outside but the mirrors and lighting make the place feel lively and spacious, even though its slightly small.  The service seems to be very male dominated; L'express is not pulling the cheap trick of hiring hot waitresses to get you in the door like some other wannabe restaurants on the parallel St. Laurent strip.  No, no, just a bunch of professional dudes who do a great job and know that they serve at one of the best restaurants in Quebec.The food is buttery, yummy and beautiful.  Its also a little grotesque to see octopus or bone marrow being served but I'll bet it tastes as good as their chicken in mustard sauce (which I suspend my vegetarianism to consume) or their salmon...The desserts are also worth waiting for, with the traditional isle flotant, some great chocolate tortes and even a baba o rum that will have your boyfriend's dad drunk in a few bites---and chanting ""baba baba baba"" for the remainder of the meal.  You must, must, must eat here if you are in town."

/user_details?userid=uIHchUrBgEXqExkKfKnusw,Jaime D.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"As a New Yorker, and a native one at that, it is said that New York has more French Bistros than France itself. And many great ones to add - i.e. Les Halles, Le Gamin, Jacques, Bar ta Bac, Provence.... Our hotel concierge advised us against this one and suggested one closer to the hotel called ""Holder"" - we should have listened. The highlight of actually going to L'express was walking through the multicolored convention center to catch the metro. Located in what the Montrealers call the ""Latin Quarter"" - really I didn't see any Latins, but many other fine little eateries. The place was not as lively as I would have expected it to be on Saturday night at 10pm. It was all maroon inside and had the feel of a pretentious diner. The service was OK, not impressive, but at least not snooty. I asked the waiter for a half bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and he brought me out and opened up a bottle of Merlot. We ordered the hanger steak and frites and the Lobster Risotto. We were for-warned by a local that the French bistros do not provide the quantity for the price they will charge and I just didn't get the hype after I got and tasted my food. I have to add though, that the Risotto had a generous quantity of lobster meat in it. I was afraid it would be aborrio rice with essence of Lobster - like a bisque. But it pleasantly surprised me with the meat. Although, at this time, Lobster is unfortunately very cheap to buy this season due to overfishing - hence the generous portion of lobster meat. Because we didn't get enough food, we had enough room for desert and the Creme de Caramel l'orange was a true mouthful of chewy orange skin bits. The coffee  that we ordered to accompany it was over roasted because it had a burnt taste.  Maybe  that's what they liked? Eh, I'll just  go to Tim Hortons.  But the cup it came in was so heavy I had to hold it up with two hands each time to drink it.  A picture is posted for your viewing pleasure. Our total bill for one appetizer, two entrees, one desert and a half bottle of wine came out to $108 USD. Sorry, I just can't rave about this place."

/user_details?userid=8P7N4FzCrLrFeBn9MmmZVQ,Becca H.,"Torrance, CA",2 star rating,"I'm so disappointed.  I don't even know where to begin.  My initial excitement was quickly squashed right when I walked in the door.  From the reviews I've read on this place and Bourdain's ""The Layover"" highlights on this place, I wasn't going to leave Montreal without eating here.  The hubs and I were hungry enough to eat dinner at 5pm and figured we would probably avoid the dinner rush since we didn't have reservations.  NO RESERVATIONS (not the Bourdain experience)Once we stepped foot in the door, the snobby older man (which I saw in all the pictures so he was probably ""somebody"") asked if we had reservations.  When we said ""no"", he gave us a look, flipped through his reservation book, and took his time.  Terrible first impression for customer service.  The phone rang and that's when he started getting irritated with whoever was on the other end of the line trying to change their reservations.  Eventually a shorter older lady came by and asked us if we had reservations.  Again, we said, ""no"".  IN THE BACKEventually they give us a table WAY in the back of the restaurant.  Normally, I don't care about things like that.  However, it was 5pm, and out of the 20+ tables in the front of the restaurant, only two were taken (by two couples).  The table we got in the back of the restaurant was right next to another Asian couple and other 6-8 empty tables.  My guess is that they didn't have a reservation either.  Hm.  The strangest thing is that before we walked into the restaurant, there was a white couple outside the restaurant looking at the menu and deciding on whether they were going to go in.  Eventually they did and my husband's guess was that they didn't have a reservation either.  Guess where they got seated?  YUP - in the front of the restaurant with the other white table.  I will end my rant here and go onto the food and service without making any conclusions.SERVICEOnce we got seated, no one came to our table for a good 12 minutes.  It got to a point where my husband was going to get ready to leave.  Because he knew I so desperately wanted to eat here, he was willing to stay.  Eventually, the waitress (the older lady from the beginning) came by for our order.  I ordered the Steak Frites and asked for it medium and the hubs the Quiche with salmon and spinach.  About 2 minutes later, the waitress came back and asked how I wanted my steak.  I reiterated that I wanted it medium.  FOODMy Steak Frites - Well, it sure wasn't medium.  In fact, it was quite well-done.  There was nearly no sign of any pink in that flank.  I found it ironic that the waitress came back a few minutes after taking my order to see how I wanted my steak cooked.  Apparently it doesn't matter how you order it because you're going to get it well-done.  Thankfully the fries were very good.  That's probably what scored them one star on this review.  The Quiche came out and it was not a salmon and spinach quiche.  In fact, it was mushroom, leeks, and ham in the quiche.  Somehow salmon and spinach must have gotten lost in translation. Thankfully, the quiche was delicious (one more star for them) but the salad accompanying it was drenched and salty.    OVERALLI'm sorely disappointed with L'Express on so many levels.  I can't recommend the food or the service.  I understand people say it's a true French dining experience. However, after being in Paris several times, I can't say this was anywhere close to what I experienced in France."

To start:Arugula with gruyere Duck rillettes (duck liver pate) Entrees:Wine: Pomerol Bordeux, 2005, Chateau Du Grande Chambellan (merlot/cab blend)Special - Duck with figs -- duck was succulent, juicy, rich, expertly prepared.  Why am I not surprised?Hanger steak with frites Dessert:The dessert was, quite simply, out of this world and like no other dessert I've ever had.  Leave it to the French!  It was the Ill flotette au caramel and was like a crispy carmelized dome with merengue filling and in a creamy sauce with crispy waffle pieces on the side.  Absolutely amazing!  You must not miss this.  Have to order. Cafe Latte -- best latte of my life! I knew it would be incredible here, that's why I ordered it and it did not disappoint.  Wish I could eat here more often, I would love to try sooo many more things on the menu. Writer's note: I have a confession...I did not discover this amazing life changing dessert on my own.  I saw it in a YouTube video where some girl ordered it and knew I had to have it.

They do offer a few dishes that aren't on the regular menu, which I have tried and are done well. But for me it's the regular menu that my steak always comes out the same as the last time I was there. If you want a multiple course menu with wine pairing Montreal has many others that do that.

Made a reservation at L'Express for Easter Sunday breakfast (11:15am) as they were completely booked for brunch. When we arrived we were promptly seated at a nice table for 2. Shortly thereafter a waiter took our drink order but it took quite sometime for our drinks (mimosa w/champagne $$$$) to be delivered by another server. Then another new server came over to answer our questions (the menu is only in French and we only speak English) and take our order. We were then surprised to hear our first server, the one that took our drink order tell, the table behind us the specials which we were never informed or. Our breakfast came out quickly and was decent (omelette and quiche) but the service was awful. No one ever came back to check on us, so we weren't able to order additional drinks when we wanted to. And we had to flag someone down for the check, well past the time we wanted to leave. Looking around the restaurant it seemed like we were the only ones receiving this horrible service - I assume because we were the only English speaking Americans. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal from the US for that reason."

When I saw how well reviewed L'Express was on Yelp, I put it on our ""must"" list, and am so glad I did. We had a lovely lunch there during a weekend getaway to Montreal.The restaurant itself looks straight out of a Parisian brasserie, much to my boyfriend's (a Francophile if ever there was one) delight. The bar is mahogany, the floor is done in black and white tile, and the tables are covered with white tablecloths and paper - just as one would expect to find. We sat at the back of the restaurant where we had a good look at black and white photographs depicting the restaurant and its staff for every year L'Express has been in business, and were quite impressed to see how many employees have remained at the restaurant for 5+ years.Service is slow, but one should expect that - the French do not rush through their meals the way Americans do (which means yes, there should be significant pauses in between courses, and yes, you should have plenty of time to review the menu before being asked to make selections). If you want the waiter, signal - he's not going to hover over your table and pressure you to leave the minute you've finished your plate, thank goodness. We did not have a reservation but should have made one - this restaurant is very busy, and if you don't want to wait, I would recommend planning ahead.When it comes to food, I thought L'Express held their own. I started with the courgette soup, which was creamier than I prefer, and I detected what seemed to be bacon crumbles on top, which I could have done without. That being said, it was a delicious soup, and I was more than happy to polish it off with some wonderful fresh bread. My main course, the quail, was absolutely divine. It was accompanied by a beautiful balsamic vinegar over a bed of wild rice. My boyfriend and I shared the tarte au chocolat for dessert, and while it was quite rich, we really enjoyed it.Quite frankly, I found the L'Express experience to be quite pleasant - it was certainly the most memorable lunch I had in Montreal this October."

The main dishes were good, I had the ""onglet de boeuf au beurre d'échalottes"" and my boyfriend ordered the ""confit de canard."" We both finished our main dishes.

I ordered the foie gras which was very decadent! My friend got the morel mushrooms on a crostini with arugula. Damn, this dish was so tasty! I loved how earthy the taste were and we both really enjoyed this appetizer!For my main entree, I got the beef tartare. It was very fresh and the portion size was big. It also came with pomme frites which were fried perfectly. My friend got a medium rare steak that was very juicy and buttery. We ended the meal with biscotti with Vin Santo et Cantucci and an Irish coffee. It was a perfect ending to our Montreal trip! I would give this restaurant 6 stars if there was that option. Totally would recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal!"

So looking at the not so exciting breakfast menu, had cafe au lait and waited till 11:30  The service was very reserved but friendly. I had the steak frits and a glass of Pomerol. The steak was perfectly cooked and wine was stellar. They served a jar of cornichons and mustard on the side. The simple bread and butter was amazing! Thanks yelpers!"

/user_details?userid=tjwblGkWN9m0vsGaypJ0Vw,Ben N.,"Cincinnati, OH",4 star rating,"More than perhaps any restaurant in North America, L'Express simulates what it's like to dine in a Parisian bistro.  It's got the real-deal French menu, and the Old World ambience is urbane and cosmopolitan, but also verging on the comfortably timeworn.  And, on weeknights at least, it seems to have regular clientele and staff who speak almost exclusively French and who seem like they've been dining here and working here for two or three decades.If that's the experience you're looking for, I can't recommend it more highly.But L'Express comes with so much hype from Yelp, Zagat, Urbanspoon, travel guides, etc., that I don't see how you can't be a bit disappointed by an actual experience here.  Ultimately, L'Express is a very nice restaurant and makes for a pleasant evening, but I don't think it really raises the bar that high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere, and so on. It serves mostly French standards.  (If you've been to Paris, you've probably had a better experience of this sort there in the same price range or even lower.  Or hell, you've probably had better French dining experiences in other North American cities.)  In other words, I think L'express earns B+ and A- grades all down the line, which is quite good, but hardly mind-blowing.  (Except for the authentic-bistro atmosphere, which is pretty close to an A+.) Bread and butter are good but not great, and we did like the jar of gherkins (with mustard) that the waiter brings to your table.  Sorrel soup was bold and almost perfect in its simplicity and balance.  But that bowl of soup was probably the highlight of the night.  I ordered sauteed duck confit which supposedly came ""with"" a salad, but this was more of like a big green salad, and not a particularly noteworthy one, with duck confit in it.  (I'm a dolt with the French language, so maybe the French on the menu accurately described this dish, but the English didn't quite do so.)  And the duck confit itself was flavorful enough but a little dried out.  The wife reported that her warm goat cheese salad was pretty underwhelming, and it sure looked like it, at least for a $12 salad.  She said pretty much the same about her sea bass, which was plenty good but well short of the best piece of fish or three she'd ever had.Obviously, it's possible we didn't order well and that we missed out on the items that best represent L'Express.A wine list that is largely French, with some reasonably priced bottles and a good number of selections by the glass.Four stars, yes:  L'Express is good.  But I bet you can do a bit better in Montreal.  In fact, I suspect you can do a bit better just in this neighborhood."

I can say only one thing: you are missing out!Well, judging by the reviews, I'm the one missing out as I've never stayed for dinner, but I can say with certainty their breakfast is delicious and affordable. Although we're big fans of l'Avenue, Express offers a much different experience and price point. Their coffee is simply the best I've ever had in a restaurant. So much so that it can be enjoyed without milk or sugar (something I have never been able to appreciate with other coffee, with the exception of vacationing in Costa Rica). So the highlight has to be their French Toast (Pain Brioché Doré avec syrop d'érable). You're served two thick slices of brioche bread (think challah) cut in four, cooked to perfection: golden and soft on the outside, moist and warm on the inside. Real maple syrup is served, which is a must in Québec. My boyfriend always gets the three oeufs tournés with baguette + bacon and a bowl of divine chocolat chaud. Last time we tried the pear compote, which is a small portion of a wonderfully smooth vanilla-caramel treat: mini spoon provided to indulge! We usually go mid-week, so it's never crowded and you feel like you have the place to yourself. Phone starts ringing if you're there close to lunch, but it's all part of the experience. This past time we joined them on a Saturday at 10:30am (they open at 10am on weekends for breakfast) and still were seated right away. The best part is breakfast is served quick so no long waits and bottomless (reg) coffee!No name shows above the door, just the address 3927 so look for the checkered black & white entrance tiles below the cream-colored exterior and enjoy!"

I went to L'express past 12pm, so my options of good food in Montreal were quite limited. Let's start off with service. Our waitress didn't give a **** if we understood the menu or had any questions. To me, that's a bad signal right there. Second, the food wasn't great. The quiche was not fresh and my steak was thin and had a lot of fat in it, when I was expecting a nice thick steak. So, I ended up paying quite a penny for food that I did not enjoy. Next time, I'll be going somewhere else for sure if I'm craving good food past midnight in Montreal."

L'express does a great job of using great ingredients and preparing all their dishes perfectly.A typical French Bistro with a long history dating back to '81 judging from their wall of employee photos, I can see why it has lasted. If you are not paying attention or looking for it though, you can easily walk right past this place.The name of the restaurant is tiled onto the floor just outside the restaurant, but there's no awning so keep your eyes peeled.  (At least there was no awning out when I was there)There is ample space and the decor keeps it charming without seeming dated.  Wait staff was excellent, although I can certainly understand why some people might find them cold.Keep in mind you're in Quebec where French is more dominant. It may be more an issue of English being the server's second language than it is a service issue.All in all it was a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend trying anything on the menu as everything looked delicious."

Out of four nights in Montreal, we EXPECTED this one to be our best meal (we were told this restaurant had an international reputation!) but it actually came in third out of four. It's good quality but somewhat underwhelming as an overall experience.  We ordered two appetizers: the pate and the mushroom tart (which was a special). The mushroom tart was AMAZING - by far the best of what we ordered. It came with arugula on top with a very tasty dressing, cheese, and ham. The balance of flavors and textures was excellent. The pate was ordinary. For entrees we ordered the roasted duck with red wine reduction sauce and roasted figs; and the halibut (both were daily specials). The duck was excellent -- in a very rich and flavorful sauce, nice mix of savory and sweet with the figs. The halibut  was just so-so. The halibut itself was bland and quite dry. The roasted red-pepper sauce was good but the best part about this dish was the bed of zucchini strips (cut thin like pasta). The atmosphere was lively and casual. The room was bright and loud. Not particularly romantic or fancy. (For example, of four nights  we spent in Montreal this was the only night we didn't get cloth napkins). The place felt more like a diner than a fancy restaurant. I didn't feel there was anything special about the atmosphere -- especially given how many other cool, cozy, romantic restaurants there are in town. The bread and butter they served was not very  good - bread was slightly dry, butter was too hard, and they did not give you small plates to serve yourself bread with.  The service was excellent and very friendly.  However, our overall experience was just a bit underwhelming. It was nothing like the total-quality experience of other Montreal restaurants we experienced. I would say it's very good, but nothing special. If there hadn't been so much hype about this place we might have gone with more tempered expectations and enjoyed it a bit more. As it is, I would say it's a good solid place with decent food, but I have no idea why there is so much hype about it. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things."

/user_details?userid=Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ,Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Bless this place for being open late AND for being delicious, as the two rarely go hand in hand. Our flight to Montreal had arrived around midnight and we were starving. Luckily I had a whole list of Montreal bistros that I had researched before arriving, and this one was not only just down the street from our hotel but was also listed as being open until 2am. We never would have found it it without the address, since there's no sign other than the lettering on the sidewalk tiles. I thought it might be a problem that we were coming in so late and ordering so much food, but our service was absolutely fantastic. When 2am rolled around, our server told us there was no rush, that in fact only the kitchen closed at 2 but actually they were open until 3am, so we could take our time.  Now onto the food, which was so good we ended up coming here again a few days later to try some more. We started off with appetizers of bone marrow, chicken liver pâté, and an octopus lentil salad. Not to mention that the table came with a big jar of cornichons and mustard. Everything was great, but I think we all really liked the octopus lentil salad the best. Next up, we had hangar steak w/shallot butter & frites, steak tartare, and a duck confit salad. Again, everything was delicious, and the steak was cooked perfectly. They had a very good wine list, so we had a couple good bottles to go with all of that. Finally, we closed with a plate of local Québec cheeses (one raw blue cowmilk cheese, and one raw sheepsmilk cheese), which we had accompanied by honey and a 1/2 bottle of Jurançon dessert wine, and espresso. We loved our food and the way they took care of us so well. We went again for lunch a few days later, and it was extremely crowded, but they managed to find a spot for us although we didn't have reservations. We repeated a few dishes from before, but we also this time tried a goat cheese salad, the rillettes, the roasted quail and the sole doré. My quail was so meaty and tender, and it had a nice honey glaze, and Mike's fish was excellent. For dessert we got their famous île flottante (a big scoop of meringue coated with hardened sugar) and a parfait. Service was once again excellent, impressive considering how busy it was.Over all, we were very pleased with the food and service coming from such a humble place. I think that's the challenge of French bistro cooking, to do simple food very well, and L'Express manages this marvelously."

It a small restaurant that can easily be missed if youre not looking carefully for it. The decor is very simple but the lighting makes it a very intimate setting. With a reservation, we were seated right away. Service was great and very helpful considering we couldnt speak/read french (they have an english menu available). There was bread, butter, and pickles to start. Bone Marrow was to die for. Literally! I swear my eyes were oozing fatty goodness by the time we were done eating it. Three huge bones served with croutons and sea salt. It was a magnificent appetizer! Duck Confit Salad - I think the duck was beautifully done. I was a bit disappointed in the salad itself however. It was DRENCHED in vinegar dressing. a bit overpowering for me, took away from the other flavors. Steak Frites - perfectly cooked and topped with an herb butter. it was really delicious. served with crisp fries. The experience/ambiance was a 4, but the food 3.5.

/user_details?userid=YzjsknYAU95hM3mS0HJljQ,Anita I.,"San Gabriel, CA",5 star rating,"First off... this is my 100th review!!!! I finally get to review my favorite restaurant!!L'express... where do I begin.  Two years ago my family and I took a road trip to Canada. we went to Toronto, Quebec, and Montreal.  My dad as our guide (even though he's never been there before) we flew all the way to buffalo, NY and rented a car and drove all the way to the border of Canada (4 hrs).  Then drove another 4hrs to Quebec.  I must say, i have never sat in a car for that long.  The trip was definitely worth it.  I love everything about Montreal, the beautiful people, the language, the streets adorned with fallen leaves.  This is where i meet  the dainty yet cozy L'express.  My brother had heard about this place and just to make sure, we asked several people about the restaurant and they agreed...it was the best french restaurant in Montreal that wasn't overly overly priced!  There is nothing fancy about this place, just checkered black and white tiles running the floor, dark wooden tables and chairs, and huge vases of miniature pickles.  Not to mention, you will only find this place by looking down. The name of the restaurant is discreetly spelled out in black and white at the foot of the restaurant. This is french food, in my opinion, at its finest...comfortable yet flossy..... inexpensive yet lavish all at the same time.  The menu is a rustic looking piece of paper, but with each dish spelled out in cursive as if someone used calligraphy to hand write each one.   For those of you who do not speak or read french, they have English menus.  Just ask!The waiter explained the specials for the night in his french accent which i found very attractive =P  He suggested we start with the Magret Canard (thinly sliced smoked duck served with halved figs and drizzled in a red wine balsamic reduction).  It was heavenly. The duck reminded me of fine proscuitto yet so opposite.  The color was dark burgundy and the each peice was so dainty.  When paired with the fig and the reduction i was blown away!  I tried to savor each piece, but between the 4 of us, we each had only 2 small slices.   My dad ordered the Parisian style steak frites w/ herbed butter.  For something so simple, it was one of the best steaks i have ever had.  When he cut into it, juices flowed out and we all knew it was going to be delicious.  The flavor of the buttered herbs and the meatiness of the beef drizzled in its own juices was so satisfying, not to mention the perfectly sliced and fried frites!  I ordered the bone marrow of cow which was topped with grey salt, served with toasted baguettes.  It was so simple, and the bone marrow was fatty and had a jelly like texture to it.  The presentation of each dish is so simple, four bone marrows, a pinch of Grey salt and individually topped with a green leaf of some sort.  Definitely not saving the best for last because each dish was magnificent beyond words... is the veal kidney with cremini mushrooms and baby dutch potatoes.  I have never eaten kidney other than cooked in soy sauce and topped with green onions.  This dish was so humble yet it blew me away.  the veal kidney was cooked perfectly.  When you bit into it, it 'popped' so to speak, and it was tender on the inside.. not rubbery and overcooked at all.  It was nicely paired with the mushrooms and potatoes.  I'm not sure what was in the sauce, but it was divine... ahh..to wrap up my long review... order some wine & do make reservations or prepare to wait 1..2..hours..even though its worth it!!"

/user_details?userid=_B-EA5Gy7U5uWNle-Krvtg,Amy G.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"The scene: Monday night toward the end of Just For Laughs. 1:00 AM. My dining companion and I had resigned ourselves to getting wasted on The Distillerie's massive drinks and drunkenly scarfing down whatever was still open, abandoning all hope on finding a nice place open late on a Monday in Montreal. And then there was L'Express.Happy to seat us at 1:00 AM (hot tip: their kitchen is open until 2:00!) service was incredibly polite and attentive. Like most folks in this French bistro, we started our meal off with some wine (an incredibly reasonable and tasty Cotes du Rhone, no less!), fresh, chewy bread, and a big jar of homemade pickles. Not much a pickle-eater-- and not even drunk enough to have strange cravings!-- I devoured these delights with dabs of mustard.After perusing the menu in wonder, we settled on a warm goat cheese salad and the ever-famous foie gras terrine to start things off. The cheve chaud was a dream, lightly dressed in a homemade vinaigrette with spring greens, endive, and crispy toast points, all topped with the most velvety, tangy goat cheese. Better yet was the foie gras terrine-- buttery, smooth, slightly salty, fatty... oh, goodness. Even the buttered toast points were perfection.We opted to share the roasted chicken breast in mustard sauce. Served with salty haricot verts, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes, the chicken breast itself was juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned to complement the tangy dijon.Both drunk on wine and foodie-joy, we lost all self control and ordered the chocolate tart. Buttery crust, rich chocolate ganache, bitter cocoa-- kind of the perfect end to an evening. During the taxi ride home, my dining companion and I were almost completely silent save for murmurs of, ""Whoa"" and ""That is easily up there in top ten meals of, uh, ever."" Service, as mentioned prior, was outstanding. Although we were the last seated, both the bartender and waitress were incredibly accommodating, friendly, eager to make recommendations, and even endured our pitiful French pronunciations. Highlight of our trip, for sure."

It's a busy, bright and vibrant atmosphere in a building that is not marked, except for the charming black-and-white tiled entryway. The servers are dedicated to their work and know their business - the kind of service that predicts what you'll need before you need it, and provides it without you noticing. The food is ostensibly simple, but artfully done, both in presentation and flavor. An easy example is the amazing crusty bread, cold butter, and cornichons they give you as you wait for your entrees. I could have happily eaten bread, butter, and pickles all night, but the chèvre chaud and canard confit were welcome interruptions - the duckiest duck and the cheesiest cheese! It's a wonderful place to linger over a glass of wine and the last bit of whatever you ordered - it doesn't matter, because it's all good. Just be sure to put in reservations early - they are busy even on weeknights!"

The meal was okay (steak frites), but I've had better for less.If you're in town for a few days and want to give it a go, shoot for mid-to-late afternoon in between the lunch & dinner rush, and you may be able to get in without a reservation.

When we walked in the host immediately knew we were from the States, so he asked if an English menu would help. We overwhelmingly said yes!Starting with the Octopus and Lentil Salad was great idea. The salad can only be described as an upside down lentil-shaped bowl decorated with circles of octopus meat and tentacles. The floor of the dish was covered with a tangy vinagrette. The lentil seeds were fresh and the octopus was soft.  A combination that can be shared by 2-4 people. The complimentary pickles were amazing. They were like the vodka shots of the pickle family. These tiny pickles packed a sour, sour punch. The bread was not amazing, it was just good standard bread. Grain Fed Chicken with Greens - This thick slice of chicken breast sat in a brown sauce that was dynamic and savory. I don't really like chicken, but this is something I would happily gobble up. Duck Confit Salad - I always thought that warm food on top of cold salad would wilt the greens, but their salad stayed fairly crisp as I devoured its neighbor. The soft dark meat was flavorful, but i feel not as flavorful as it could have been. There were also smaller, bright red, rectangular pieces of duck that were amazing - soft and rich in flavor. The combination of the three pieces really made the dish. So, try to cram it all in your mouth =).  Quail with Wild Rice - This was an amazing dish that I wish I had gotten. If you go, get this. There were several pieces of quail that you may need to eat with your hands, but it is well worth it. The quail was succulent and juicy - perfectly cooked. The wild rice was slightly crunchy, very hearty, and very savory. This dish was very dynamic and I can almost say, fun to eat! Sea Bass - The downer of the group. The sea bass was swimming in olive oil and although not cooked badly, it is not something worth driving all the way to Montreal. Dessert - Floating Island - This sufficiently fed 4 people, and I feel like this could even stretch to 6!  This was a dome of whipped egg whites encased in dark golden brown sugar glass floating on top of sugary waters. The dessert left me wondering about my dental health, but it was definitely interesting. If you want to try something new, try this. Overall, a very pleasant evening on a cold winter night."

We had the warm goat cheese salad (ok), steak frites (good), the lobster risotto (good) and orange panna cotta type of desert (bad). The portions are much smaller than what we Americans are accustomed to. Our bill was approx 120 CAD with a 1/2 bottle of wine, not including tip. Service was friendly, although painfully slow (how typical of the french!). We even had a ""French Canadian local"" tell us to stay away from French food in Montreal; he was right.

/user_details?userid=U5ihhqG7PI7kyE9Ob2uqog,Umami Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"An old Montreal classic, L'Express might be the most authentic Parisian bistro this side of the Atlantic. Imagine a long narrow space with classic checkerboard floor, stainless steel bar, tons of mirrors, hurried staff, packed tables, and most importantly, a jar of gherkin pickles on each table. Bright, loud, and bustling, don't come expecting a quiet romantic atmosphere, this a Parisian bistro, not the US version, damnit. And true to form, haute cuisine it is not - rather, emphasis is on hearty traditional French foods, impeccably executed. Although the food is unpretentious, service definitely comes with attitude. This is a proudly FRENCH Quebec restaurant, not English, and if you don't speak French you are nothing more than a tolerated vistor.  I can certainly distinguish my ""poulet"" from my ""moules"", but that basic knowledge doesn't take you very far when you are struggling to order ""mousse de foie de volaille aux pistaches"", whilst the waiter disdainfully looks on, glaring impatiently, visibly grimacing at the mangling of his precious language. Also, you might need some help distinguishing the finer points of the French menu beyond basic vocabulary (god forbid you ask  your waiter). So my suggestion is if you can, bring someone who knows their way around French cuisine and language to help ease the interactions. To his credit, our waiter was quite helpful when it came to wine recommendations. From the dishes we ordered, I'd recommend the bone marrow with sea salt, the lamb with potato gratin, duck confit, and the quintessential hangar steak with frites. For desserts, the very potent baba au rhum is recommended for only the very rum-friendly. The flourless chocolate cake, however, should be experienced by every man, woman, and child on this planet."

The bartenders are always tidy and stressed in could-kill-you-with-graciousness kind of way. It is very French which can take some time when it comes to ordering. Not to mention the specials are hand-written on the left margin of the menu. An English menu is available for rejects like me who are still remembering what shark is in French. Again, my love of the counter has a home. A long, long bar set for full dining. You'll see everything from Sex In the City like groups of girls who could care less if men were ogling them because they're so involved in some good dish to what look like unshaven musicians to professor like men huddled around a table as if they've been going there for years. The food is fresh, timely and presented beautifully. I saw the squid come out and I thought it was a bouquet of flowers. Next time, I'm definitely trying it. It can be a little pricey but when every other good restaurant is closing, L'express is just picking up. Grab someone by the hand and huddle in the foyer until you are lead to the perfect seat.

To start with, let's talk about the great French bread that they serve. It tastes just like the bread in France. None of that fake French bread that we often see in America, First course consisted of duck foie gras. The flavors were moist, rich, delicious. Entree consisted of shrimp risotto for the gf. She was a bit disappointed. Rice was a bit overdone and the shrimp were a bit tough. I had steak tartar. A rare treat that is normally not done that well in the states, so I took full advantage of the opportunity here. We also had a nice bottle of cote de Rhone wine. A mix of different tarts were given for dessert. Then to complete the meal, some digestifs consisting of a raspberry flavored ""eau de vie"" (water of life) and a $19 dollar glass of J. Walker Blue. For those of you who drink scotch, this is a great deal. The servers were very friendly here. Probably the most incredible part of the experience was that as we were leaving after midnight, this place was still serving people for dinner. The place was still full and new tables were still arriving. Incredible!"

/user_details?userid=KKdBQXnUlVUZ0ZNTfMQoEA,Tolga E.,"Hayes Valley, San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Yes! Another Montreal classic. L'express is both the most memorable and most forgettable restaurant you've ever been to. It was so memorable, that I have to write this glowing review, however, it was so forgettable that I could never remember the name, could never figure out how to search for it, or how to even describe in a somewhat unique way. And yet it is just that - unique. Oddly enough.The whole reason I went to Montreal was to experience Europe for half the money and take in a Habs game. I took in the Habs game on a Saturday, and had Sunday night to have my romantic poor-man's Europe experience. L'express delivered.From the outside, this place is completely non-descript and somewhat forgettable. You could walk by it on Rue St. Denis and choose a thousand other restaurants over it in pretty quick fashion. But, if you come in from the ridiculous winter cold, you get a totally wonderful experience. L'express is, in my opinion, the ultimate French bistro. Not that I've ever been to France, but if I had to paint a picture of what the ultimate French bistro in France would and should look, sound, and feel like, L'express would be it. Checkered floors, a long, classic bar area, and a narrow table-clothed dining area. It's fine-dining, but rough enough that you picture some poor, disaffected artists eating frites in the corner. We sat at the bar, and the bartender spoke absolutely NO english. Perfect. We ordered a small glass of the house red, which was $5.00 CAD. Awesome. I think the house red was still a French red. Don't see that much anymore. This being a French bistro, I went with the hangar steak frites, so I could try and compare it on even terms with the more faux-french american bistro's I'm used to. Perfect. The hangar steak was wonderfully cooked in the simplest of preparations, the frites were undeniably wonderful, and the whole meal was delivered as efficiently as possible with as much charm as possible from the french-speaking bartender. I also remember eating some of those cornichons in the picture, though I'm fuzzy on how that came about. Maybe it comes with their totally awesome french table bread?Overall, L'express is fast, affordable, romantic, poetic, and delicious. It's like having a dream about Montreal more than actually being in Montreal."

We ordered bone marrow and Quail on wild rice. Presentation was very nice and both dishes were very rich in flavor. I loved the quail A LOT! It was very tender and juicy and yet the skin was caramelized and sweet. The bone marrow was interesting, but definitely too ""rich"" (greasy taste) for me. I also thought the prices were quite fair. The quail was about CAD 18.In LA, I'm sure that'd be USD 25-30 at least. We stolled a bit on St-Denis. Very nice street with lots of unique shops. Highly recommend this restaurant!! 2 thumbs up!!"

My partner, who works for an airline, and I decided for a short get away to someplace we had never been. As experienced ""space available"" travellers we usually ""fly by the seat of our pants"" so to speak and don't make set plans. With this said, we decided to venture out to L'express with no reservation. We arrived at the restaurant at about 6:30pm and enquired about a table. The Maitre'd said that there was one table reserved for 4 at 8pm, however if we could finish dinner in 1 and half hours it was ours... Sold.. The menu was handwritten in French, however they also have a printed menu in English, Spanish and Italian. The waiter asked us if the English menu would be of assistance... another point for service. Since we were on a time crunch we ordered 2 courses each and decided to wait and see about dessert. I ordered the Octopus and Lentil salad and Martin had smoked salmon... The Octopus and Lentil Terrine was light, refreshing and set the tone for the rest of the meal. Martin enjoyed his smoked salmon immensely. Next he ordered the duck con-fit on a bed of greens and green beans while I ordered the shrimp risotto. Both were absolutely magnificent! It really was like we were in Paris! We decided to skip the dessert as we were almost approaching the 8pm hour, however I did see some of the choices and they looked spectacular. I will definitely be back to this restaurant on my next visit to Montreal. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=aEqdWoEgKDgz_wExZj3Pwg,Lucy L.,"Oakland, NJ",5 star rating,"So many reviews raved about their Burrata Tomato Salad so I had to try even though I would prefer to order something more French.  To my disappointment it tastes just like the Italian tomato salad with mozzarella cheese and basil that I made at home.  Nothing too special except the texture of the burrata cheese, a more soft creamy version of mozzarella cheese.  It still taste very good but I am just not ""wowed"" by the taste.  The presentation of this salad is very good so it will still be a good choice if you don't need to have classic French.  We also ordered their most famous bone marrow and it was not dry like some review said.  But I found ours too greasy.  Since we make osso buco at home this bone marrow was just ok.  But I have to give them credit for making this available because it is a tough job to cook bone marrow just right.  I did like my kidney main course--classic French taste.  I love the small plate so you don't need to bring the leftover home.  We ordered their cream brûlée because their best floating island was sold out.  It was really good, probably the best I have had in years.  I stopped ordering cream brûlée in the US because they were too eggy.  This one is perfect and with a pistachio twist.  Very nice.  Can't finish a French dinner without the cheese.  According to our next table who are a local regular customers I ordered the blue cheese because they said it is the best blue cheese in the world.  I have to admit it is worth it.  The taste is subtle, unlike many blue cheese, and you can taste lots of interesting things.  That makes it a true gem.  I also had their chocolate truffle, another well done.  I had to order a macaroon to try and remind myself why I never like it that much.  Although their macaroon was done perfectly I still think it is too sweet for me.  The wine we ordered also needs time to air.  It tasted better after 15 minutes.  I read some review about their wine and believe it could be their wine was not given enough time to air.  Their service was good also.  It was worth the experience after all."

It's just great french fare in a throw-back environment that won't cost you an arm and a leg. It's certainly not the best resto in Montreal, but with french bistros costing you a dime a dozen here, this one's by far the most worth it. The crowd is fun, the wait staff is quick and friendly, and the steak frites is just as it should be: crispy golden fries next to buttery pan-seared bavette. I also really loved the jar of gherkins and the bowl of dijon they leave on the table. Apparently, this is very french. Other things I've had-- the lamb, the mushroom ravioli- is just good. The presentation was a bit 80s and the portions were small, but both were tasty. L'Express also has baba au rhum for dessert-- but it sells out, so go early! Reservations are a good idea."

My friend and I were looking for a place to eat at 11p after having a couple of drinks at the bar. Everything around the hotel seemed to be close but someone recommended Le Express because they served food until 2a. The place looks like a diner mixed with a white table cloth restaurant. The servers were nice, fast and polite. I ordered some bread to tame my hunger and to my disappointment it was incredible hard and chewy. It was served with cornichons and Dijon mustard which I found incredibly delicious! I decided to order one of the specials which was spaghetti and mushrooms. I have to say for a pasta without a lot of sauce but to have so much flavor, even without cheese, I was amazed! My friend ordered the croque messieur which was amazing but the French fries were atrocious. So, I guess it all depends on what you order and what time you arrive. I would definitely go back in a time of need."

/user_details?userid=qPBuYezVaC7C4F7YKNDJ_Q,Yen D.,"Charlotte, NC",5 star rating,"A highlight of my week of eating in Montreal.  We made a reservation the day of just in case it was crowded, which was a great idea.  We were seated quickly, though we had to wait an oddly long period of time (did they forget about us?) but other than that the service was impeccable.  Cozy little place crammed with tables, no sign in the front, full of older business-looking people and their families/friends.  We were definitely the youngest patrons.  After the bread, butter, mustard, and pickles came out, we started with the incredible bone marrow.  It was just fat, but a big glob of it with a bit of sea salt on the toast was an amazing culinary experience that melted in your mouth with so much flavor.  I can't recommend it enough.Then we had the tartare (i ordered it epice or spicy), which came with fries and was quite yummy, as well as the saute of confit de canard on salad which was incredible.  Very flavorful duck perched on a lightly dressed salad with mini croutons and fried pancetta (perhaps); everything about the dish was good.  The only disappointment of the meal was the dessert, when we ordered an ile flottante (floating island).  Because of the fairly classical execution on the dishes so far, I was looking forward to the usual bowl of creme anglaise topped with that exquisite island of edible cloud to remind me of Paris, as the rest of L'Express does.  But instead we had a plate of custard with a gigantic mound of meringue coated in a FAR TOO SWEET thick coat of brulee, vaguely maple flavored.  I ended up pushing aside the candy coating and eating the rest of the dessert, which was fine but needed more of that yummy vanilla cream custard.Despite the dessert and weird wait before ordering, however, this place still merits 5 stars from me-great service, good ambiance, and very very good food.  It was a perfect last meal in Canada, and our bill including tip was about $80 CAD."

The caramel chunks in the sauce were simply too large and unmanageable.  On previous visits these were broken into small pieces.  This was a small oversight but one the chef should address.Service here is always impeccable albeit very formal and a bit stuffy.  In part this is because this is definitely a ""see and be seen"" establishment.  We dined next to a local news anchor although I must admit I didn't know who he was or what all the fuss was about.  All told this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you're going to Montreal do not miss the opportunity to have classic French Bistro food done well.  You will not be disappointed."

I'm seriously beginning to question the dining scene up there. L'Express is a proper bistro complete with bare essential service. We also waited 40 minutes beyond our reservation time. Trust me the free beer was not worth waiting 40 minutes. The food was only worthy of two stars. Salad was just a salad. Terrine of foie gras was nice but not worth 30 CAD. (Why on every menu in Canada is foie gras so expensive? I find it much for expensive than anywhere I've been the USA.). Veal cheek casserole was nice but nothing special. The risotto could have used more protein in it. Lamb was OK. Just nothing popped out as being above average. However, the bread was awesome. No need for me to come back here."

The foie gras terrine was good but very similar to other foie gras terrines I have had. My husband had a duck confit salad for his entree. It was tasty and had a nice variety of vegetables. I had the steak tartare and it came with fries. The steak tartare was good, but not that different from the tartare I have had in Chicago. The fries were kind of thick and not very crispy.  Nothing really stood out to us. Although the food did not wow us, the ambiance was nice and the service was friendly.

Like the other reviewers have said, no signs out front (unless you count the sidewalk) so it's a little hard to notice at night (especially in the rain).  The tables are dressed in white linen, but the dress codes varied from jeans and a t shirt on some diners to a suit on others.  Don't forget a reservation!!  The place got to capacity quick!  Four of us dined together and we had: the lobster risotto, the roasted quail, the duck con fit and the grain-fed chicken in mustard sauce.  They were all simply amazing!  We ended up having to share with each other because of how fantastic everything was.  The salads were perfectly fresh, the vegetables were crisp and the wine list was superb. My best friend and I decided to share a half bottle, and the wait staff was kind enough to split the half-bottle on both of our tabs without us even asking! As for the wait staff, they were simply amazing. They were very courteous and even encouraged our poor french, so that we cold try and figure out the menu on our own as they stood by just in case we had questions. But don't worry, they do have English menus!  The only negative (our fault)  thing I can say is that when you look at the dessert menu, pay close attention. My friend's wife and I ordered the Creme Caramel with orange thinking it would be like a Creme Brulee, but it was more of a thick custard, It was still good, and our own fault for not reading all the way, but just keep that in mindI cannot wait to go to Montreal again so that we can have a traditional french dining experience at L'express!"

A goat cheese salad with endives followed and it was ok but nothing special, then a steak tartare, here we had a miss.  For me the texture (seriously ground to a mash), was so unappealing, and the flavors were too mild, barely anything other than capers, at 24$ with a choice of fries or mashed, this was the big let down.  On the other hand the wines are great, they get all private imports which is ideal, we samples a gigondas 2008, costing 58$ that was very appreciated.I have in the past been here for breakfast, which is rather limited but always good, it is not for those looking for bang for you buck or to fill up, but it is a very pleasant atmosphere.They have really long hours and are often opened until 1-2am so if your looking for some quality noche, after hours this is a great alternative to crap food usually available at this time of night."

We had reservations for 10 pm and arrived a few minutes late due to a subway glitch. The Maitre d' took our coats and we were seated immediately, and I have to say, we received nothing but excellent service before, during, and after our meal. First of all, we had about three waiters attending to us. Our main guy was patient with me and my lack of knowledge regarding the French language (and everything was spelled out for me in English on an alternate menu as well.) We enjoyed wine and baguette with a-m-a-z-i-n-g butter (I promise to not wax poetic on the butter, but again, AMAZING) while waiting for our meal. Another waiter kept our water glasses full and brought us a mason jar full of gherkin pickles and mustard to enjoy while waiting for our salad. Now I'm sure this is some French bistro custom, but it's like they spied on me while I was snacking by myself one night and made note of it for our upcoming visit. Yummy. We ordered the warm goat cheese salad to share, and I ordered the shrimp risotto (with visions of Rachel Z. salivating dancing through my head)  while my boyfriend had the duck confit sauteed over a spinach salad with green beans (or haricot verts, if you will.) Everything was delicious, luxurious, and buttery. Our waiter was absolutely charming and didn't make me feel like a bumpkin (impressive, considering my reaction to the pickles), plus, he had a sense of humor, making a melodramatic show  of reading the menu while my boyfriend entered his tip on the portable debit machine. We had the profiteroles for dessert, and while I wasn't wildly impressed with them, it was definitely a solid dessert and the chocolate sauce they came in was delicious. It was a pricier meal but not ridiculous, and certainly worth the money and the freezing trek from the subway. Bon appetit!"

Roumalade was light and almost creamy (though no cream in it.) Duck confit salad, duck ""steak"" with figues, a hanger steak frites, and country vegetable soup for main courses. All done to a tee and couldn't be improved. The steak frites was truly standout for an old standby. And the duck with figs rich and flavorful for a winter night.  Soup was a thinner broth based one, in a classic french style. Not super hearty but flavorful.

Thankfully at 8pm on a Saturday night we were able to get seated within 5 minutes due to the table not having anyone next until 9:15pm. Lucky for us.The bottle we got was from Chile and was only 21CAD. We looked around and that's what everyone was boozin' off of so we knew it had to be decent. We were sitting in between two of the cutest old couples. One was drooling at my dessert, the other was talking about using the internet to book hotels (nice!). For appetizer we got the bone marrow, and it was SO amazingly juicy, fatty, and delicious. Hurt so good. We ordered the chicken in mustard sauce and the duck confit salad. Both were tender and flavorful - consistent delivery. This altogether with the vino made the experience even better. The chocolate tart was rich, but just what I needed to wind down.  The service was great -- had about 3 different guys wait on us throughout the night.The great thing is that it is open until 3am, you don't see that much. Topped off the night by checking out a jazz club near by. The neighborhood in that area is so cute. So much shopping I wish I could have done! I'll have to come back for more next time."

I was in the mood for the traditional garlic and butter escargot, but the way L'express prepared was even better. The lamb was a huge portion and was wonderfully cooked. My wife and I shared a great piece of cheesecake for dessert. We also enjoyed a great bottle of 2005 Bordeaux. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was traditional French - zinc bar, black and white checkered floor, etc. Definitely a great place to go if you're in the mood for an old school bistro, and its open until  2 am."
/user_details?userid=hT3kGKYFnLflIifxyeKWwg,Angie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"The first night I was in Montreal, I was ripped off by a restaurant pretending to be French. The second night there, I confused Montreal with Paris, due to a perfect French restaurant named L'Express. We didn't make reservations,  but this was not a problem. We walked in on a Sunday night and immediately got a seat at the bar. Perfection. The service was precise and the experience was unique. When we were seated, a jar of mini pickles and mustard that is akin to wasabi was set before us. I consumed a quarter of the jar and ate half a loaf of bread before I even placed my app order, not because service was slow, but because they were so tasty I could only inhale them. For an app, we had the bone marrow. The stuff looks horrid, but wow. It is served with very crisp toast and sea salt. Eat it all together and the dish is irresistible. Pure fat, but so light that it just melts away with each bite. For my main course I had the Steak and Frites (fries). Ordered it cooked medium and it was done perfectly (my dinner mate ordered hers blue and it was by all means still moo'ing). So juicy with just the right amount of redness. The seasoned juice from the steak was absorbed by some of my fries. I ate them all. All. Did I lose a touch of my dignity when they removed my plate and you couldn't actually tell what was served on it because I cleaned it so well? Perhaps. But was it worth it? Very much so. I will say that having the bone marrow and the steak was a bit much. My mouth tasted as though I had coated it with fat. Totally my fault for over doing it, but I couldn't resist. It was just that good. My dinner mate suggested I skip dessert and just have an apple back at our b&b. This seemed so wrong. So wrong. I went on and ordered the Chocolate Tart for dessert to help cleanse my palate. This was a let down. Not as ah-mazing as some have described it to be. A little too dense for my liking. But all in all, L'express was a perfect meal that set us back about $100 Canadian for an app, two steak dinners, two beers and a dessert."

I'm giving it four stars because the service was excellent and for the most part, the food was tasty. We started with a warm goat cheese salad (delicious). For dinner, my husband got poached salmon with chervil mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were fantastic and the fish was good enough. My main (chicken with a mustard sauce) was perhaps not the best selection ... the chicken itself was a little overcooked/tough. I was expecting a quarter chicken but instead I got a very thick breast (which probably explains why it ended up tough). For dessert, we had a maple tartine, which was delicate, flavorful and not overly sweet. I'd definitely recommend giving L'Express a try. Our waiter was fairly honest when we asked for suggestions, so perhaps this is the way to go."

Upon entering I believe that there is no longer the sign outside bearing their name but ask anyone on the street and they will point you in the right direction.

We started off with the bone marrow appetizer. Oh, Lordy Lordy! It was GOOD! I wish we each ordered our own. It came with four large pieces of bone and slices of toasted baguette. Next, we each had a simple salad and a splendid Burgundy. I ordered grilled halibut and the hubby had a chicken and beef stew that came with a large piece of marrow in bone. I was a little jealous. For dessert, a pretty little chocolate tart that melted in my mouth with a strong dose of espresso. The service was very decent and attentive without being fussy. It's a bustling atmosphere, loud and lively. I love having dinner in places like this. It's got that non-contrived look about it other restaurants try to create. It feels authentic.

/user_details?userid=aoXueUpissaKRRVgTFZ-5Q,Lisa S.,"MA, MA",4 star rating,"This classic French bistro in a bustling, hip Montreal neighborhood is a lot of fun, good for groups and families.  It's a long, narrow space with tile floors and small tables placed close together--which makes the dining environment as authentically Parisian as the food.  I wouldn't come here for quiet conversation, but my husband and I enjoyed the energetic, sociable vibe.  Waitstaff were knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Excellent cornichons and mustard on each table were nice touches.L'Express has an extensive menu with most of the greatest hits of bistro fare (pot au feu, steak frites, pate, duck confit, etc., etc.).  Starters vary widely in cost, from roughly $5 to $25, something to keep in mind if you're on a budget, because what you choose for that course, if anything, will determine whether you have an expensive meal or a moderately priced one.  Mains are mostly in the $20-26 range.  That said, some of the starters (quiche and salad, lobster risotto) are substantial enough to be a perfect main course, and others, like the chicken liver mousse, would be good to share. They offer a moderate, mostly French wine list with a good selection of wines by the glass.My husband ordered a warm goat cheese salad and the hanger steak with fries, and I had a special cold soup, a kind of vichyssoise with artichokes, and then a warm duck confit salad.  Both starters were on the bland side--maybe 3 stars--but the main courses were fantastic, solidly five-star, deliciously and precisely prepared.  My husband's hanger steak was the best we'd tasted in years; it did not need the accompanying (and delicious, in a lily-gilding way) herb butter.  Fries were classic French frites, down to the garlic aioli that came with them.  My duck salad was amazing, full of crisp-edged pieces of sauteed duck confit over a spinach, radish and endive base that was dressed with what I strongly suspect was duck fat.  Super-rich!  After all this goodness neither of us could imagine dessert, which was a shame, because the dessert list looked great.  My advice? Skip the starters, or share one with someone else, then have a main course and dessert."
/user_details?userid=2GF3gFtiXKExV1ugsGpXPg,Andrew B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Saturday dinner for four, reservations booked about 5 days ahead. The place was still bustling when we left around ~12:15am. We were shown directly to our table when we arrived, with the waiter removing a ""Reserved"" sign from a table near the front windows of the restaurant. Ah, a good signal.Service was snappy and on point, keeping everybody happy while not being over-obtrusive. We felt like we got a little attitude at the start (being four American males in their mid-20s), but the service warmed up quickly. Recommendations were excellent and the waiters were knowledgeable about both the dishes and the drinks. For appetizers, we had the rillette, chicken liver mousse, ouefs in mayonnaise, and a good cheese salad. As a devotee of salty meat and fat, I got down mainly on the rillette and the mousse. The rillette was rustic and flavorful, with a chopped texture that had just enough creaminess to allow you to spread it over toast. A rich, gamey pork. The mousse was probably the highlight of the meal; one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. An ethereal, fluffy emulsion of savagely herbacious fat. God, I love it. I did not sample the other dishes since we had a vegetarian with us, and I did not want to eat his appetizers, but he had nothing but good things to say. I will also point out that they were very accommodating, making many suggestions to him.Dinner was the duck confit over a salade verte. While the duck was spectacular, with wonderful contrasts between the creamy meat and crispy edges, I was most surprised by the greens. Fresh, flavorful, high-quality greens can bring a salad into another stratosphere. These slightly bitter, crispy greens, dressed lightly in duck fat, were perfect.We had the creme caramel and maple syrup tart for dessert. The creme caramel was mediocre, with a kind of flabby quality. Not much flavor in the sauce, either. The tart was delicious, but I thought the crust was a bit dry and crumbly.Dinner for four with three courses, two bottles of wine, digestifs, taxes, and tip was $270. A fantastic meal. Well-executed, classic bistro fare served with no frills or attitude, with great service."

Wonderful wine list with plenty of bottles between 35-50 as well as dozens of options (even if just to glance at) above that price and half-bottles as well. The steak was tender, well portioned and the pat of shallot herb butter perfect to spread between the grilled crust and crispy fries.

Tres bien.  For dessert, we split 2 because we couldn't decide on one.  The first was a delightfully light and zesty mango and rasberry sorbet over a crunchy cookie sheet.  The second was a parfait.  I don't speak french, but it was perfecto.  It was designed as follows: top layer of maple-y creamy nougat; pear butterscotch middle layer; covering a bottom layer of port soaked plum.  I closed my eyes, cycling through the long history of desserts that I've experienced in my lifetime, trying to find a comparison.  Then i realized i was cycling through the wrong category of food.  It was not a dessert; instead i should have been cycling through my short list of orgasmic experiences."

When we arrived for our 8 pm reservation on a Friday evening lots of people were waiting for a table. The service was excellent. Our water glasses were always filled, more of the delicious, complimentary bread was brought to us without us having to ask and the server answered all our questions thoroughly. He was even patient with us with as we practiced our French and helped us to learn some new vocabulary. :) Also, despite the fact that it was rather busy, we were never rushed to order or to finish our meal. I ordered a glass of Reisling which was fabulous (although it's a rather small pour). We really enjoyed the complimentary bread basket. They also provide a huge jar of cornichons (pickles) and mustard. I also had the goat cheese salad which was great, featuring four large portions of goat cheese and various greens including endives. As I said above, the steak frites was excellent with hot, fresh frites and a delciously flavored steak. The portion was more than adequate. For dessert I just had a truffe maison (small chocolate truffle). It was okay but nothing to rave about. My friend had the ile flottant which she enjoyed a lot. I'd highly recommend L'express for excellent food at rather reasonable prices and good service.

On the recommendation of a friend, I found myself shimmying up to the bar at this restaurant in a pretty hip - albeit understated at night anyway - part of town. I made a reservation just in case, but was delighted to see several empty spots at the bar. Hy (pronounced Ee) immediately introduced himself and made a wine recommendation based on my mood, and once the meal was selected, suggested another to suit the palate. The meal was fantastic - truly. Having spent the previous weeks in Vegas and New Orleans, I feel qualified to say this. Hy recommended the fiddlehead fern to start and the lobster risotto, both specials in season. I'd never had fiddleheads and was delighted to devour a dish of almost tender asparagus-like tendrils in a delicately scented light cream sauce that was rounded out with bits of ham and slivers of toasted almonds. I could have called it a night after this dish but decided to stay for the main course - a risotto of sweet lobster and a confetti of zucchini, red pepper and tender peas. Once the plate was cleared, I asked Hy for an after dinner drink suggestion in place of dessert and we decided on his first idea, a viscous, sweet wine with a nutty finish. Dinner complete, a list of personal recommendations for other restaurants and place to check out in Montreal from him, I was sleepy with thoughts of what and where to dine next. *On a side note, I read with interest about someone's butter comment. Indeed, the butter at L'express is remarkably good and I'm ashamed to admit, I slathered it on quite think to the equally delectable bread. Perhaps the calories are better spent on one of the restaurant's myriad specialties though."

/user_details?userid=8P8rrKya9OggLEtUr4seBg,Ruby Q.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  We were in Montreal for the weekend and went to grab some drinks at a local establishment.  While there we asked the bartenders what they thought was the best food in Montreal.  They both agreed that L'express was the spot to go.  So we took our chances and headed over on a Saturday night, no reservations.  Apparently we got super lucky, since most people say you need to book well in advance.  We got a table in 5 minutes and then the unbelievable experience began.The waiter was so nice and explained everything well.  We got the pate and the steak tartar per the bartenders recommendations.  I absolutely hate pate and have tried several different kinds., However, my husband loves it and he made me try this one.  It was incredible.  I didn't want to stop eating it.  The steak tartar was equally as good.  It was by far the best pate and tartar we've eaten.For my main dish i got the lobster risotto which was delicious.  By the end of the night we were both thoroughly satisfied and agreed that we completely lucked out by meeting those bartenders (Baldwin Barmacie, check them out for some good cocktails!).  Cannot wait to go back to L'express!"

We came in on a recommendation from a friend, around 8:30 on Saturday night, without a reservation, and the staff did their best to accommodate us. The food was delicious, the service wonderful, we were thrilled! I should mention that we, as a group, are not easily impressed, we dine out a lot, and are fortunate enough to live in cities that offer fantastic food and restaurants. L'express was the dining highlight of our vacation! Thank you L'express! Keep up the great work!!"
/user_details?userid=Wv6Dv-q8lnyUrb8u-d9m5g,Jay G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I am so glad that I don't have to deal with going to Paris to experiance this level of gastronomy.  Every bad review I have read about this place seems to come from people who claim to be New Yorkers - I haven't put a connection yet as to why but for the moment if your mail gets sent to zip code 10001 through 10282 and you summer on hampton beach, you might want to stay away from this place or risk comparing it to all the way more fabulous places in Tribeca and Soho.  All kidding aside L'Express is everything that it should be and nothing that it should'nt. On the two ocasions I have been service has been phenominal both from servers and bartenders.  That was also one of the chief complaints about this place - I haven't experianced it and I don't see how unless it was busy and someone was camping out and not realizing it.  Lets get to brass tacks... Food - Phenominal! Best Steak frites in Montreal, excellant thick hanger steak cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and mooing on the inside) with a rich herb butter: frites were also amazing, medium cut not to thin not too thick and not greasy at all.  Salad was perfect as an app and I was able to try the Ravioli of the day (house made) and it too was perfection.  So far I have only tried one wine on their list and thats all I have to.  One of the bartenders put me on to Brunel De La Gardine 2007 Cotes Du Rhone - modestly priced but it breaks the mold for young Cotes Du Rhone (in my humble opinion).  They tell me that there is an exclusive agreement between express and the Brunel house in France - meaning this isnt available anywhere else in N.America, currently I spend my time on the internet and in wine shops around the tristate area trying to make that NOT SO. Back to topic - For Dessert they have the typical brassarie faire of truffles and flans, my table elected the Chocolate truffles sold individually.  The concentrated chocolate flavor of one was enough to satisfy me as a molton chocolate cake, with alot less fuss.  A few things to think of before you go.. make a reservation because they are busy every night; get the bone marrow because they ran out of it last time I was there and I know it must be good;  go for wine, because liquour pours are typically measured as is standard in Montreal; try to get a drink at the bar and chat up the staff and bartenders - they are very friendly and helpful, even so far as to recomend other resturants for your trip. I love this place and I want to sublet a table for an entire summer!"

/user_details?userid=BdBzXtp1yWntU_VqmG_XkQ,Mahsa Y.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"I think this place will be a consistent favorite.  It is expensive, but worth it.  I think you have to try it for yourself to believe.Had the bone marrow, which is great, and a cod appetizer off their specials, which was okay.  Steak for entree was wonderful, husband got the scallops off the specials, which were great as well.  Our server was excellent, full of information and suggestions.  Dessert was the tarte tatin -- warm with ice cream -- yum.  I had the dark chocolate torte, which is intense but also very flavorful.I really like the atmosphere, the bar when you walk in, the cute bistro-type tables and chairs, and the way people are crammed in there gives it a cozy feeling.The people next to us had their small child (5 yrs), and he looked both bored with his food and the location -- not sure if it is a good place for children.  It can also be tight on space for strollers, but I think they are accomodating."

/user_details?userid=Y7qZ_uShSxg-68FJLGVYlA,Joomi K.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"the ambience is very French bistro (probably why it's called that!) with typical French food and excellent wine menu.  They had a lot of wines by the glass and there were many reasonable options.  We ordered:- Foie gras - absolutely delicious.  It was so fresh and creamy and light.  The best foie gras I've ever had- Bone marrow - I love bone marrow, but this was a bit disappointing.  I don't know what it is.... It was healthy portion and it was prepared very simply, which I like, but something about it didn't blow me away.- Quail with wild rice - Quail was perfectly cooked and crispy and the wild rice was really ""wild"" rice, not some fake version.  Seasoning was perfect- Pork and sausage ravioli with sherry sauce - reviews said their ravioli is really good because it's homemade, but I didn't really see anything special about it. Maybe I'm spoiled from all the NY Italian cooking, but I thought this ravioli was just good, not excellent.  Nothing about it was bad.  In fact, it was really quite delicious, but it just didn't blow me away."

My husband had the quail and I had the shrimp risotto which both were good-- but not earth shatteringly fantastic.  What was great was the little jars of cornichon pickles and spicy (like clear your sinuses mustard) at every table. And again, the service was so attentive, it made the average meal so much more special.  They do take Amex Ex"

Their goat cheese salad is amazing, and everything we ordered was good (croque monsieur, the kidney, country style soup, and the crumble for dessert). The waitstaff was extremely attentive without being overwhelming, and very kind despite the fact that we were a bit underdressed and slightly out of place (re: You'll feel better in a collared shirt and don't wear jeans).

We started with the bone marrow, which was interesting but good. I had the duck confit over salad and my partner had the lobster risotto. Both dishes were absolutely delicous. The risotto was perfeclty cooked and the duck wasn't too greasy. Also, the vinigrette was really tasty and I enjoyed the texture of the salad. Definitely indulge in some dessert. The flan and chocolate tart were incredible. The prices were really reasonable.  The staff was great and you don't need to speak French."

/user_details?userid=guznnHcshKIPIYzKadDiew,Terry B.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Very disappointing. We had to wait 45 minutes passed when we had reservations to be seated.Regulars who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. The staff were cold and unwelcoming and told us they werevery busy. When we finally got seated things went from bad to worse.The escargot was served on bed of mash potatoes and  mushed peas had and had   no flavour  the sorrel soup was more like diluted pea soup very weak, the salmon was over done served on bland spinach. We asked numerous times for their famous pickle jar and finally got up and got it ourselves, which was less than 10 feet away The staff was very unfriendly and food mediocre  at best .We had been here before and it was much better the other times  .Maybe they just  had a bad night but we won't be back soon.We are regular attendees of the great Montreal Jazz festival and love coming to MontrealThere are many superior places in Montreal that have great food and  service that are better than this place.This is definetely  not a 5 star bistro!"

This is as classic French bistro as you are going to get. Solid French food, nothing fancy, but they excel at every dish they do. Had the Hanger Steak with frites and it was good. Nothing to drool over - a solid steak. Also had the duck confit and that was tender and full of flavor and came on a bed of greens. Appetizers were a mayo egg and chicken pate, which is highly recommended. Skipped dessert. A solid meal that reminded me of Parisian bistros visited in 2004."

We were able to get a table for early Sunday evening and the place was still relatively quiet. We were greeted with some of the best baguette bread and mustard/cornichons. We had the goat cheese salad, ravioli and the steak tartar. Even though it was obvious we were the non french speaking tourists, the waiters were very nice and helpful. The service was prompt and they gave us help with our young toddler. Sadly he was out of patience by the end of the dinner so we didn't have a chance to try the desserts (though we did take a walk up to suite 88 chocolatier for a decadent hot chocolate."
