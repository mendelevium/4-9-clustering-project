/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I got duck on rice to go and it tasted good, nothing exceptional though. The duck was very boney and there were many tiny bone particles all over the piece of meat. Also there was very little bok choy. Their prices aren't the cheapest compared to other restaurants in China town."

They have a bakery up front that sells the classic hong kong style buns. Amazing deal of buy 6 get one free, and the buns are HUGE. You can also purchase cantonese barbecue up front as well, where they have the ducks and pork hanging by the window.The back half is a sit down hong kong cafe.They have the classic ""pick two barbecue"", where basically you can choose one or two bbq items, and have it served with rice or 3 other types of noodles. GET IT. The portion sizes are old-school-diner big at old-school-diner prices. One dish is $6-7, and you can get a drink with it for $1.25 more. I got the shrimp wonton noodles, which is not on their physical menu. Wontons were tasty and better than the other hk cafe in chinatown. They also have bun and bubble tea options if you wanna enjoy a quick afternoon snack. Anyways, I'm super glad we stumbled upon this restaurant because it gave me such a nostalgia kick.The crowd seems like the local elderly cantonese population, so I hope more people will come here and experience some casual and crazy affordable hk cuisine!"

It was good, but me and one of my friend had gotten sick. She and I were in the loo whole entire night!!I don't suggest anyone to eat the crispy bbq buns because I felt like I'm eating raw dough."
/user_details?userid=FXu1BTvGx9FmqJXPoQoXsQ,Alex M.,"Alhambra, CA",4 star rating,"Typical for a Chinese restaurant, service was nothing to rave about - it was abrupt and delivered without a smile. We even had to go to the counter to get our own menus after we were seated. BUT, they were accommodating in that we wanted to order two items not on the menu and the server checked with the kitchen staff and was able to make it happen. FYI they do have an English menu. Place is relatively clean but we didnt check out the bathrooms.Yeung chow fried rice was not greasy and had lots of ingredients. The shrimp and egg rice noodle Â was our favourite and one of the items that we special ordered. We also had a bbq pork rice plate that was pretty skinny (we prefer a little bit of fat for tenderness) but satisfied our bbq meat craving. We originally wanted the roast duck rice plate but they said they were out - this seemed weird as we clearly saw a duck hanging in the window. He did say we could order a roast duck congee instead so we opted for that. It was flavorful but oily, though there was a lot of duck meat. Maybe there was some miscommunication but at least we got our duck. We also ordered a preserve egg and shredded pork congee. It was plain but good.Overall for 4 adults, 2 kids it was super affordable at about $55 including tip. There's also a bakery up front and bbq items you can order to go."
