/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I used Uber eat to try their food. They just recently opened. My favourite dumplings place used to be Chinatown's. I notice the quality dropped so I moved on to try some new places. I had pork&shrimp&ginger and a chow mein. I can tell the dumplings were freshly made. I like their sauce which is a sesame one and a soy sauce one. The sesame sauce was pretty unique and added a twist to my routine. Chow mein came with kimchi which I liked a lot. Hope they can keep up the quality and then we can go there regularly.

All are obviously made-to-order, not pre-made and held.  Steamed or pan-fried. (The pan-fried are better.) Made-on-premises dipping sauces include spicy peanut sauce and a soy sauce option. I love dumplings and these are the best I ever had. Owner/chef and his wife, originally from Hong Kong, just opened the charming, small restaurant and are personable and hard working. Worth it from anywhere!  Love the classic French accordion music in the background."
