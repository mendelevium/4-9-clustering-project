/user_details?userid=mGpSdlT6XfHOtr-uHJgRzA,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"100% Highly Recommend Café Vasco Da Gama which is One of my favorite spots to go for coffee or grab a bite in Montreal. Take it from me as a regular happy client - I often go there alone, with friends and often bring my clients there :)Always friendly (they make you feel like your 2nd home) and have a helpful service even though it's often busy! Food is always delicious and there is an amazing selection on the menu. Food is always made from fresh ingredients cooked with lots of love. My suggestion while your there: Try any of their gourmet sandwiches and specially the Tuna Burger and Nata (Portuguese custard tart) - you won't regret it :)* The only recommendation I would have for the store is to add more comfortable seats for people who have back challenges.FYI: The Café Vasco da Gama takes its name from the great Portuguese explorer"

/user_details?userid=t4YGU4l5yTsYWEsg1GvwvA,Behrooz Y.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Summary: ok food, unpredictable service, awesome window seats. I've dined at Vasco da Gama several times, for lunch and for coffee/pastries. The coffee is good (they serve Illy). The pastries I tried have been consistently mediocre. The sandwiches are mostly tasty but overly greasy. The soups are usually delicious. The service here is very unpredictable. Sometimes it is normal, but, gosh, I've been unlucky at least half the time. They have table service, but there is no one to seat you or notice you if you take your own seat. They also serve you at the counter, but most of the time they lose track of the order and who ordered what. I've had mixups even when ordering at the table. This is worst at lunch times. I will come back here because of the window seats. They open the windows during the summer and there are seats right up to the edge. You can enjoy a little breeze along with your coffee and watch people hustle on Peel or Maisonneuve. Vasco da Gama is best for a late afternoon visit when you are in no rush. It is not a place to go if you are visiting from out of town."

The look & feel takes Jacky on a voyage to Portugal. Staff is friendly, and coffee is fresh & of good quality.Price is high but typical for the location. Can't go wrong with a nice latte and pastel da nata. If Jacky sets sail for the city, he's dropin' that anchor like it's hot at Vasco's.Follow @JackyEatsMTL"
/user_details?userid=FPv27CkYLodbfz3gj5Fnkg,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,A great little cafe. It's exactly what you expect and need it to be. I came here purely because it was opened early and close to my hotel and that's okay.  It wasn't too touristy and was not hotel food. I ordered the Fisherman's wrap which is essentially lox and eggs in wrap form. It was great and the cream cheese tasted very light. It came with a side of fresh fruits which were out of this world. I also ordered a Portuguese egg tart and grapefruit juice. Everything came promptly and the service was great. I'd come here again for my breakfast.

The location is downtown near peel , the inside is very pretty and airy and they have lots of indoor and outdoor seating. It's cozy and chic yet casual at the same time. the staff friendly and provided great service, the prices were affordable,  so no complaints there either ! I had the bifana sandwich and a side of couscous shrimp salad. The sandwich was tasty , lovely fresh bread &flavourful pork. The side couscous and shrimp salad tasted so fresh and bright , subtle flavours and so well prepared. They had so many delicious sounding side salads to choose from it was hard to narrow it down. And obviously I couldn't leave without a pastel de nata , which was perfection as always , buttery flaky fresh crust and creamy yet not too sweet custard filling (definitely don't leave here without having one of these !) I really enjoyed this place, I would definitely recommend giving it a try !"
/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,Robert G.,"Clackamas County, OR",4 star rating,"Reading a friend's review on Yelp informed me of this place and, believe me, I'm always on the lookout to add to my list of Portuguese possibilities in the Maple Leaf Country because you can't really access this sort of food too readily in the States except maybe in New England and New York's New Jersey suburbs with enough Portuguese residents.  So, I'm glad to have added Cafe' Vasco da Gama to my list and to tell you about it.Your Metro station for Cafe' Vasco da Gama is Peel and the French(-Canadian) lady on the train pronounces it ""Peell,"" so as to rhyme with a subsequent station she announces as ""McGheell.""  I wonder how they named this station.  When I hear this name, I am more apt to think of the poised and proper Mrs. Peel on ""The Avengers"" than I am the ""dechets d'une banane"" that you might slip on.  As you stumble out onto de Maisonneuve, don't wander too far.  It will be right there around the corner, albeit unobtrusive.  It's a long and narrow joint, with seating and tables that are shoehorned in.  Clearly, it wasn't intended for McGill students to get too comfortable and study here.Cafe' Vasco da Gama is a breakfast and lunch place ... or it can be just a coffee, or coffee and dessert, place.  I made it a breakfast place.  I ordered an omelette (the Vasco da Gama) with shredded chourico and cheese, a pastel de nata (one of those famous Portuguese custard tarts), and a cup of basic Illy brand coffee.  It was fairly priced, although the pastel de nata was a bit higher than the low prices you find them for in small Portuguese towns.  Everything was good.  Interestingly enough, the basic coffee was delicious.  The omelette was circular and did not appear to be folded.  Instead, the ingredients were somehow interspersed within it.  I was famished and devoured it.  As for the prices, obviously in Canadian coin, I had to tell myself ""divide by 1.30 and it begins to look more reasonable.""They were busy yet they managed to be nice to their customers.  Also, if you talk to one of the managers and know about Portugal and things Portuguese, they seem to be very receptive to that.  Even if the place is small and you can't sit around too long, Cafe' Vasco da Gama has some cool ceramic art to look at as well as some wonderful depictions of Portuguese history on the walls pieced together as panels of azulejos.In closing, ""gosto muito do Cafe' Vasco da Gama."""

Their omlettes, burgers, salads and pastries are great! Every time I am there, I feel like i am in Europe. This place has a charm and keeps drawing locals and tourists. It's usually pretty packed. In the summer, they have a lovely terrasse on Peel. You will enjoy whatever you end up ordering!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Great lunch option for folks working in downtown Montreal. There's a good mix of hot + cold dishes; lots of soups, salads, sandwiches and my favourites - the burgers.I had the tuna burger; it's seared and topped with spinach, tomatoes + caramelized onions. It was tasty and filling. My partner got the Burger of the month, a chorizo burger topped with egg, thin French fries + mixed greens; it was massive and very very filling. Both dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. We both got the Greek salad. Everything tasted fresh and flavoured to perfection!My only (minor) complaint is that when you walk in, it's not intuitive what to do next. First, you're assigned a table. Next, you go to the counter and place your food order. Then, you go to cashier and pay for your food and order (and pay) for your drinks. After this, you sit at your assigned table and wait for your food to be brought out. I would have appreciated verbal instructions or signage re: this process rather than fumbling around like a major clutz.I would recommend and will definitely be returning!"

/user_details?userid=iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"After an ill-fated attempt to grab breakfast at Universel - tip: don't go to this place at around 11:00 on a Saturday - we were wandering around trying to find somewhere else to eat. We stumbled on Café Vasco da Gama and were drawn in by its homey, intimate vibe.We were quickly shown to a small table near the front, and I began scouring the menu for something appealing. I eventually settled on the Vasco da Gama wrap (""egg, chouriço, São Jorge cheese, spinach""), because how can you go wrong with those ingredients?The answer is you can't, not really. And while this very simple wrap didn't blow me away, it's nevertheless a solid dish that I enjoyed eating. The ingredients all worked quite well together, and the food arrived hot (which meant that the cheese was still delightfully melty). I was admittedly a little disappointed in the lack of bold flavors, but this is a mild complaint. (I should note, too, that the backless stools get pretty annoying after a while.)"

/user_details?userid=V_yDb-sO60p2w7hPxV5P5A,Alexander S.,"Birmingham, AL",4 star rating,"Cafe doesn't have big tables - only small round shaky ones that can barely fit breakfast for three. Several tables can be put side by side, but seating is better suited for singles or couples.I've ordered fisherman's omelette with Viennese coffee, latte and biscotti. Both beverages were rather good (they use Illy beans), I've easily consumed two cups, but I can't commend the omelette. While I really like Egg Benedict with salmon, their salmon omelette didn't work - two tastes just doesn't match each other. Biscotti wasn't impressive, but it was good enough - not too sweet and not too crumble.My wife has chosen Mediterranean omelette with americano. Her omelette was much better than mine. Would've call it good if not for the olives.Daughter got grapefruit juice, which was awesome, and chocolate croissant, which was good but a bit weird.Overall, a nice place for breakfast if you just happen to walk next to it."
/user_details?userid=k7pXrI7mLNnG59y1OYKFTQ,Patrick M.,"Watertown, CT",5 star rating,This is a great little cafe. It's in an area where there are many nice stores and things to do. They have tables and a couch/booth area. We came in for lunch and I ordered the Kobe beef burger and my wife and kids each had the burger of the month which was a cod burger.My burger came with soup or salad and I chose the broccoli and cauliflower soup. The soup was excellent and it was definitely something I haven't tried before. The burger had the works and had blue cheese on it. I loved the burger and it filled me up and made me feel great.The atmosphere was nice. You could order food or get treats. They had a decent sized case with brownies and cookies and other treats. It wasn't crowded but wasn't empty either and the waiter was attentive to our needs.I would definitely stop here again. It was a little pricey for a cafe but it was expected given the area and the food ended up being well worth it.

/user_details?userid=ulk3n0JW8tWnQ83C7m8z9A,Jay L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Super solid place to have a quick lunch after dropping our luggage off at Gare Centrale with our group of four.It was a really quick walk from the station and I think I made the right choice as we walked in to a delightful buzz in the cafe.The space is a well-lit long and narrow space with the service bar on one side and a collection of different seating arrangements along the other side.The key thing on the menu is the made-to-order omelettes or the delicious looking sandwiches along the display window.I went for a western style omelette that was made fresh and it was delicious. The two pieces of toasted baguette was a very very welcome addition to the meal.  So satisfying to hear that crunch of the bread and then dig into the fluffy egg afterwards.I didn't have room for any dessert but they also looked very good. :-)The only little hiccup was that they somehow lost the ticket for one of our orders.  We waited 15 minutes and then asked them about it.  Turns out the ticket somehow fell off the board and underneath one of the panini presses. :-\I watched them make the order double-time so that was a good sign.Would definitely want to come back again.

The Cafe is a cute little place - staff is friendly and helpful. I ordered the beef croquettes and the cheese plate. The beef croquettes were really really hot and really really good - deep fried deliciousness with tender meat inside. My cheese plate took a little longer to get out but was worth the wait as the cheese they had was really good with whatever jam it came with. I think this place is a solid lunch option at a good price point."
/user_details?userid=MmnPGQFG2KuTwwkYwM8e9g,Aiesha B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"What a fancy joint. Stunning tile murals line the back wall and the front is strategically packed with a wide selection of wine bottles, coffee and artsy ceramic items. There are a couple of enormous paintings (one of them looks like a classic depiction of Zeus) and massive mirrors on the wall that make the narrow cafe look more spacious than it really is. The staff moved a mile a minute to serve dozens of people waiting for their caffeine fix or sandwiches. Despite the pressure, they do an admirable job of maintaining composure and a genuine smile. There isn't much space between the seating area and the service area, so after paying for my meal, I stood around awkwardly, trying to avoid getting in the way of the many patrons behind me. The supervisor was extremely apologetic about the long wait for my sandwich - ""Le Pecheur"".  This egg and salmon breakfast wrap is small and served with fruit. The thin slice of salmon was fresh and smoky, but also overly salty. The other ingredients include plain cream cheese, capers, spinach and barely seasoned eggs. Based on the price, I was underwhelmed by the wrap. Indeed, this upscale cafe charges an arm and a leg, but they certainly deliver when it comes to their drinks. I had a latte that was so bold, full-bodied and delicious, all my price-sensitivity melted away in the steam... I came back the day after for an iced coffee, which was creamy, rich and beautifully presented in 3 layers (whole milk, coffee and foam with chocolate sprinkles). The third day, I tried their mocha (along with 3 gourmet chocolates). The mocha is rich with a deep aroma and pleasant after taste of real cocoa. It was complimented well by the chocolates."

I love the ambience of this Café- an old vintage, comfortable seating and brunch options. Prices remained under $20 for their menu- pretty reasonable. Service was fast and the waitresses were knowledgeable about their specials of the day. I tried a freshly squeezed mixed fruit juice that had berries and watermelon as a base - super refreshing. For my main course I had the duck and fig sandwich served with a soup of the day or salad. The sandwich didn't really do justice to its title - the  duck was pulled and overpowered the other flavours (which is usually the case with duck as a main ingredient) but the sad part- I didn't even taste any fig or mango!! Which is why I picked this dish! The small Greek salad was nice and a perfect portion. I had a cup of coffee after my meal that totally hit the spot. I would stick to the assorted tapas menu- cheaper and more options to try among larger groups."

Despite this, they checked and allowed us to sit and we ended up ordering cafés au lait, croissants and portuguese natas pastries.

It's a great alternative to the Starbucks universe. It's a very narrow space, but still a decent amount of seating. The only downside is you have to stand in line in such a narrow space to order your drinks & food and then you get seated, I would prefer they allow you to order at the table as space is severely limited. The little custard pastries right by the cash are AMAZING! Smart to put them there as an impulse buy since as you wait to order and pay you can't keep your eyes off them.......and they're delicious. You can't beat the location right in the heart of downtown. Definitely worth coming here for the coffee. I haven't tried the food but the other patrons seemed to really enjoy the food as well."

All my friends rave about the duck sandwich but I usually go for the roasted veggie! If you stop by for a coffee you have to get a Portuguese nata with it.

They make you take a seat, you order for yourself at the bar, no service. Im not at my mothers house, im supposed to be at a cafe: I came to relax not run around the restaurant ordering and waiting for it to come to me. You also have to pick up your own coffee, the only thing they bring to your table is the food. What? What concept is this? The hostess was also rude. Screw this place, im never coming again. I only lasted through this experience because my girlfriend wanted to stay, i wanted out within the first 4 minutes of being there."

/user_details?userid=-cCTkUasCOj26YNNLbWRWQ,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Came here for breakfast on a weekday morning and was surprised that there were only a couple of seats available. It's a counter service cafe with omelettes and breakfast sandwiches. Illy coffee is served here. Had a vegetarian omelette and added cheddar cheese. The omelette was ok and didn't have a lot of filling. It's not a large portion. The omelette came with 2 pieces of mini baguette and a couple of pieces of fruit. Overall, it's ok. Not bad for a quick bite and a coffee when in the area, but not fantastic enough for it's prices for me to make the effort to go there."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Vasco is owned by the same person/people who own Ferreira. The difference is that Ferreira is high-end, while Vasco is more affordable, offering a variety of sandwiches, salads and desserts. It's suitable for breakfast/ brunch/ lunch, while Ferreira is more suitable for dinner. Ironically, the service at Vasco is MUCH better than Ferreira. Both offer Portuguese dishes. Vasco has basic staples that you will always find on their lunch menu and these include tasty delights ranging from the bison and vegetarian burgers, to the Ferreira club and preserved lamb panini. They have such a great variety of options that you would be hard-pressed not to find something that pleases your palate. My personal favourites are the veggie burger (made with quinoa), the Club, and the grilled veggie and goat cheese panini. All three are amazing.  All burgers and sandwiches come with your choice of salad, and you can usually find 4-5 different salads being served (these all change daily).  While all of their salads are delicious, my go-to is the sweet potato with curried chicken. At least I think it's curried. Either way, it is damn good salad!Their dessert selection is quite good for a small venue, and include the traditional natas and other pastries. If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll have to try l'Entrechoc - my FAVOURITE of all chocolate desserts! It's a tart with a firm crust (I think it's got a butter base but what do I know?) and i's filling is a combination of dark chocolate with caramel and whole hazelnuts. The top is a thin, crunchy crust. It's to die for! On that note, I've gotta go. There's an Entrechoc waiting for me with my name on it ;-)I gave them a 4 because the place is very small, and when you order to go, you have absolutely nowhere to wait for your food, other than at the cash, which has a table right next to it. The table is next to the entrance where everyone piles in to wait for a table. A bit chaotic. If you're going for lunch, get there before Noon and you'll be fine. Remember that the hostess will assign a table number when you arrive, and you will order your food at the back. A server will bring your dishes to your table. You can pay after you have ordered, or when you're done."

To be honest, I don't blame him. Good food, good music, good service. What more can we ask for ? Owned by the same owner as the higher end restaurant next door, vasco is a more affordable and trendier option for people who are looking to grab a quick bite, or catch up over coffee and desserts.   Although the cafe is always jam packed with people (mostly business people who work downtown), it's never too hard to find a seat. Plus the owner/manager is always extremely enthusiastic, making sure that you don't have to wait long for be seated. As for the food, it is FANTASTIC! I've tried the chicken chorizo burger, chicken chorizo wrap, tuna burger as well as their breakfast wraps. All are amazing, especially the tuna and chicken chorizo burger. Their coffee and desserts are also extremely good. Warning, they are highly ADDICTIVE, especially those cookies. This is the perfect spot to catch up and munch on some sweets after shopping, both of which I've been doing too much of.   Anyways, vasco de gama is a total jem in my books and i would 100 % recommend to anyone !"

It's got a very European feel so much so that you could almost imagine you are visiting somewhere else. Case in point their Nata(s) - Portuguese Custard Tarts are tops from what I've tasted over the years. I stopped myself from ordering a bunch more. I was happy to see they now have a one page tapas menu after 4pm which adds to their fresh daily pastry selection and other light meals ie. burgers, salads, sandwiches oh and how could I forget their Euro style coffee selection. I believe table service is also on the new side. In sum they've raised their own bar. I even noticed a catering menu on the way out. The seating isn't traditional, but is still great for business chats. It's one of my first thoughts for downtown meetings."

We even saw Helene Bourgeois-Leclerc once! The food is exposed in a counter in the back; they have a good selection of sandwiches, salads, some burgers, plus desserts, muffins, croissants & cookies. I personally like the gluten-free chocolate one: rich, a little bit crunchy, but still melts in your mouth. As to the food, I definitely recommend you get the trio of salads! 10,75$, always fresh & usually creative, comes with two little pieces of toasted bread = happy belly & guilt-free conscience. As a side note: they make a rather good latte."
