/user_details?userid=-Qw088X2mCyxkAMov9Qqlw,Xochitl M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing pizza. Good portions. Super friendly staff. Everything you need for a weekend takeout. They sell the little glass bottle cokes which I love !
/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pizza you can buy by the slice! I walked in here to grab a few slices today around 6pm and there was only 1 other customer there so service was fast. The slices are huge and it's thin crust so that means it's New York style!Despite the slices being quite large, 1 slice alone isn't quite a meal so I would order a salad or have something else with it.I tried the meat one (it had pepperoni and bacon) and the gargonzola. I wish they had an ""all dressed"" option with peppers, mushrooms and whatnot but that wasn't an option. From what I've heard, in order to have the New York pizza experience, you have to be able to fold your pizza in half and eat it with 1 hand. Well, the crust was a bit overcooked so I couldn't fold the pizza. I'd love for a foldable pizza for the NY experience."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Since opening in Griffentown New Yorkaise has become one of our go to pizza spots. As there name suggests, they serve a New York style pizza, i.e. big, which you can buy the New York way, by the slice. A mural on the wall proudly explains that each slice measures 12 inches by 12 inches. If you get 4 slices you might need a box to take it home in, if you drive a small car the box might not fit in your trunk. I'd describe their crust as medium thin. On the this side, but thick enough that it maintains structural integrity. My go to slice is the peperoni, my wife ends to gravitate towards the sausage. This is an all-round great spot to grab a  slice of pizza while you're wondering around Griffintown or hanging out at the canal."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Been wanting to try this pizza place for a while so like a good Yelper, I checked out the previous reviews for suggestions and the Gorgonzola delivered!  It's simple but satisfies the taste buds. For $3 extra, you can order the half half pizza. We also ordered the 3 meat. It's just a little bit spicy. Definitely preferred the richer flavors on the Gorgonzola side. The 22"" thin crust pizza is cut into 6 slices and 1 pizza was enough for 4 adults. Don't forget to ask for the chili oil!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been meaning to try this spot for a while but never got around to it but I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed I can now order from them for delivery due to this crazy pandemic. I was blown away by the size of this pie! Some of my favourite pizza spots charge the same price for a mere half the size of this pizza. I lightly reheated in the oven and enjoyed two slices and have enough for a few more days too. I had ordered the mushroom pizza, and I can tell you that, although I would have liked to see more toppings, there really was no need; my pie was fine!! Definitely will do again!"
/user_details?userid=DwuLtfL0_A-Kk4EwO10Rww,Sylvie Q.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great pizza in Griffintown! It is so big that two people would be better at carrying it than one! I have never seen such a huge pizza before. There are 6 slices. I like the name of this restaurant but nothing can surpass the REAL tasty pizza. Therefore, I prefer New York City's pizza."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"About a month ago hubby and I were craving some pizza and this place popped up on our Uber Eats app. We had never heard of it before and saw great reviews so decided to give their mushroom pizza a shot. When it arrived, we were FLOORED. The pizza box was HUGE! Opened up, it was easily longer than a meter! The pizza itself was super delish - not heavy or greasy and absolutely delicious. Definitely way too much food for 2 people but we were happy to munch on the leftovers the next day. The price was totally decent given how big this pizza really is (like...maybe the surface area of 2.5-3 standard large pizzas). Totally recommend!"
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing pizza spot! Their tomato and ricotta pizza is my fav. But their mushroom pizza and the pepperoni pizzas are equally delicious! Really close to my where I live, which is always an added bonus. Reza is super warm and welcoming. The customer service here is excellent! Definitely recommend this pizza joint. Oh btw, their slices are humongous, typical New York style pizza slices."
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"I've found there's a real shortage of NY style pizzerias in Montreal. Considering this, La New-Yorkaise is a welcomed addition! I visited the restaurant a few weeks after opening and thoroughly enjoyed my experience - so much so that I returned two days later and reordered the same thing.  At their staff's recommendation, I ordered the Gorgonzola pizza and it was perfection. It has mushrooms, red onions and Gorgonzola cheese, topped with pesto oil. You can taste the quality ingredients used. The crust was perfectly crisp and glazed with garlic butter, and the gorgonzola added an extra kick of flavour.The restaurant is clean and spacious, but seating is limited. I'd say it holds approximately 10-15 people at a time. Take-out is always a great option though - you can order and pay online and pick up when it's ready!I'm sure I'll return much sooner than I should."
/user_details?userid=mVRKwa4Ch4HSiEJ0KPRMIQ,Freddy G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing New York style pizza. Thin with a slight crunch. Never soggy. Add the spicy oil and some parmesan and get ready for a party in your mouth.
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Already came back for more with my whole family. We ordered a full pizza half Gorgonzola and half ricotta tomato. The owner Reza is so nice hebgave my dad a beer for his birthday. He really cares about his clients and loves what he does. He is here 7/7days and he says they will be opening a second location very soon.
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Simple review here. This is a great place to come for a slice of pizza.  Several to choose from. $4-4.50 for a nice 12-inch slice of pizza. I went for the tomato and ricotta pizza. Great thin and tasty crust. Overall really good place to come for a quick bite. I will be back!P.S. they do have salads too...I admittedly didn't look...I was here for the pizza!
/user_details?userid=NiZK2S0SOfSRR4P50KN98A,Meaghan P.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have made this our go to pizza place since it opened. I don't think there is a single topping mix we don't love. Go to favourite for me is the cheesy and earthy Gorgonzola with mushrooms and red onions and my boyfriends is the sausage with the red peppers, and mozarella. The ability to walk in and order 1 slice at a time, at the incredible large size it comes makes it a super satisfying stop in when you're walking in the area. We often order whole pizzas and love seeing people's reaction to the extra large boxes when they see us. Order a full pizza of 1 type, half/half or build your own box of 6 slices mixn'match. The owner and staff provide amazing service with a smile, and taste and quality never disappoints. Repeat client, highly recommending you stop in and grab a slice!"
/user_details?userid=AVPIsBnCxr-tQ4V5799pkQ,R M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,An option if you really want a slice in griffintown or downtown. Edible but costs over $5 a slice. Not New York pizza.
/user_details?userid=c_rVwkiLFabxj2oc4Esc2A,Litomedia P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Gorgonzola pizza in the making! Ready and about to devour it! Amazing  worth the detour
/user_details?userid=XyZzLPQrBbHOvOXfWM1Tgg,Angela H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Meh. Nearly $5 for a generic tasting slice and parking in the area is impossible so I had to eat in my car. It's nothing I'll be coming back for
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Welcome addition to the neighborhood.   Although I do prefer Adamo, this is better than average horrible slice we see in this city.   Though Its a little on the dry side.  I'm a huge New York style pizza fan so I'm just happy this is an option for me close by."
/user_details?userid=Ai6hp1zy64CzpFz6twOmKQ,Annie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried their pizza du mois today (asparagus, onions, etc) and it was AMAZING! Good quality, huge slice, for a fair price (4-4.50$). Will be back for sure!"
