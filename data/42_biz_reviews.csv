/user_details?userid=GuLH1c0GUbIdUVVTxx-img,Jamie L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"No doubt this is one of my favorite Korean restaurant in town. It's really close to my school and the price is reasonbale. My top picks are pork bone soup, seafood tofu stew and seafood pancake. Usually if I order stew or soup, they always come with two or three side dishes and rice. Great place for me to have lunch or dinner after study :) just hope they have delivery service soon."
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I like this Korean restaurant. It's very close to mcgill university. They have many choices of main course. The dishes we tried were tasty. And surprisingly their price is very reasonable! The restaurant also has a second floor with large space.  Which is good for large group party :)Staffs are very friendly. Will definitely come back.
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It doesn't look like much from the front door, funny story is I know they opened for awhile and told my wife that we need to try it but then completely forgot about until last week.We both finish work and just went there for dinner.So we ordered some stuff to share and I must say, the quality is surprisingly good!I'm a big fan of fried stuff  so we ordered alongside with the bulgogi combo and fried chicken cutlet rice.Everything, all of them, they are freaking good!Especially the chicken cutlet, I would it would be dry in the inside but no, it's super juicy!The bulgogi is served on a hot plate, again I thought the heat will eventually dry out the meat... Nah it just intensify the tasty smell lol.Another thing that really shock me was their price, I don't recall how much it was, all I remember the price was really really not expensive compared to other restaurant in downtown.Amazing place, will RETURN!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I have loved Opiano since a smart Yelp Elite took me there a couple years ago, so I was so excited to see Issan's review letting me know there was a new offering from these amazing owner/chefs. When I had an hour to myself this weekend between meetings I popped in to check it out, and ended up eating an unreasonable amount of noodles and feeling amazing about it. Woorijib doesn't look outstanding from outfront, and it is an older building where the front sunroom could use a little love. But there are lots of cozy corners, warm booths, nice vibes across several floors. The service is quick and very friendly and food comes out quickly. There are tasty and affordable lunch specials and lots of options for vegetarians and vegans. I ordered glass noodles with fried tofu and vegetables and egg and was served quite a large sharing portion. I thought I'd be taking half to go but the flavour was so nice, and the dish itself not greasy or heavy, I ended up sitting, relaxing and enjoying the whole thing. Happy Lunar New Year to me!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Woorijib is the new baby from the owners of Opiano. There's great similarities between the menu of the two places, but Woorijib is a proper sit down restaurant with table service, versus the more casual, ""cafeteria"" style of Opiano. The interior is bigger than you would expect, with the whole second floor set as a dining room. The building is not very new, but the ambiant light level, lanterns and decorative foliage made the place feel cozy and relaxing.We went there for dinner recently and the food was very good. The homely, comforting dishes were generous in portions. I had the Woori Jib Jungshik with bulgogi beef, which comes with a portion of stir-fried beef, vegs and rice. My friends got the Poulet-kassu and the Japchae bap with bulgogi. They also brough us a serving of side-dishes (kimchi, fishcake, etc). The food came quickly and was nicely plated. The ssam sauce was very tasty and went well with the beef, especially wrapped in the provided greens. Service was courteous and attentive. Sadly their shaved-ice machine was broken that night :(Really happy there's now an alternative to Opiano (which is closed on weekends and after 8 PM)."
/user_details?userid=_yrWWc93xAK1f-WZ2Bvo9w,Jack M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Went back and forth on the rating but ultimately what sealed it for me was that this place makes delicious food.I was in from out of town and, thanks to Yelp, this popped up as a great spot not to far from where I was staying. The person I was traveling with had not tried Korean food before so I was hopeful that Woorijib would be able to provide a good spot for his first foray into Korean Cuisine.We started by ordering some sake. The sake menu had two offerings and few more from the soju side. Overall a decent selection but not much of note.Based on some reviews and pictures, I expected panchan to be brought out to us but it was only after asking. There were just three offerings, kimchi and two more. This was probably the biggest disappointment to me as I am used to the spread of at least six or seven different dishes.Moving on to the main food though, we decided to try three dishes as I was trying to get some of the most popular dishes for us. We ended up with the beef bulgogi, pork bibimbap, and tofu japchae. Everything was fantastic and to be honest I was a bit surprised. The menu had such a wide range of dishes I expected that would mean nothing really stood out but everything that we ate was great. The japchae was especially flavorful and well balanced.A quick note on the space and service. Service was polite and the right level of attentive. Space was fine but really nothing that I had an opinion about.Come for the great food. It's tasty."
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Cozy, calm and hip atmosphere. The service staff was kind and timely. I try to refrain from making stereotypical comments but there seemed to be many people of Asian descent all talking in a/many language(s) other than French or English eating at the restaurant; I think this is a great sign in general because white people dont always have great taste in foods from ""outside their comfort zones""! I will definitely return when I spend lunchtime near the McGill downtown campus to try other menu items. The reason I took down 1 star is because the bibimbap tasted a little plain for me. Everything was very fresh and filling but nothing extraordinary. Once I applied and reapplied the red sauce that they brought with the dish it was spicy and flavorful!"
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A cozy and calm spot for good Korean food. With the same owners as the popular korean resto Opiano, their food did not disappoint! I got a chance to try this fairly new place out for a friends birthday, and I'm glad I did. I decided to try their pork bone stew, which came with a side of rice, fish cakes and potatoes, and it was delicious! The broth was so rich and well seasoned and not overly spicy, while the generous amount of meat fell off the bone. Others tried the bulgogi bibimbap, which came in a big portion and tasted great too. As for the service, the waiters and waitresses were all very pleasant and helpful, which made the experience of eating there even better. Also, the food came in a reasonable amount of time (~15mins) despite being such a big group.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this spot if you're looking good and cozy korean food! The food is great and is fairly priced, the employees are pleasant and the service is good. My only con at the moment would be that they currently don't have desserts, but fortunately will have some in the future."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious new korean place in downtown. The food were good and flavorful. I love that they have a mixed platters with many appetizers such as tteokpokki, kimbap, etc. They even have an individual portion for budae jigae. They give you lettuce and ssamjang to wrap their meat dishes. The service is great and they come refill your water several times. The place is quite big. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This new Korean spot popped up relatively recently (late 2019?) and I went in with friends after a nearby conference, since I don't really love the other options nearby on Peel.I accidentally found a new favourite Korean place. Nice. I'm pretty picky about bibimbap, ok? Some places don't make the bowls hot enough. Some places pre-cook the egg so you don't get to swirl it around properly. Some places don't let you have extra gochujang to add at your own discretion. But Woorijib does all these things perfectly.And it goes further! I had something called a KIMCHI ISLAND which is extremely adorable. It's basically just a bibimbap where the rice - mixed with kimchi - is placed in a tower, and the egg - raw, and beaten - is the ""sea"" around it. IT IS VERY CUTE. And also delicious!I've only tried the kimchi island, the mixed starter plate, and the deep fried seaweed rolls (my fav) but I'm excited to keep coming back to try more :)"
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love Opiano and I was thrilled to hear that the owners of Opiano was opening a more of a sit down type restaurant with cozier and a bit more upscale atmosphere. I went to Woorijib around lunch time and was seated right away. Service is impeccable and the variety of food is great too. They have some of the staple menu items from Opiano that I really loved but have a bunch of additional items that I have yet to try. I got the lunch bento box with tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and it came with a few pieces of tempura, assortment of kimbap (korean sushi), salad with their magic salad dressing which I adore very much, rice (which I substituted for more salad). Can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good Korean restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal! They have a good selection of typical Korean food. I went there on a weekend evening for dinner and was satisfied with both the service and the food. The waiters were very helpful and kind. The food itself was good, but not necessarily better than other Korean restaurants in Montreal.I decided on the ""Jungshik"", which is a meal where you have to make your own roll. It was the first time I tried this meal and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was well seasoned without being too salty. The portion was good for the price paid as well.Overall a good place to try out if you have a craving for Korean food."
/user_details?userid=ifobaHSMEX2ylus_XU4Kbg,Phil C.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"It was close to 9 pm and restaurants were starting to close. It was my second time in downtown so I broke out the trusty yelp and filtered by open now. Found this local place by my hotel and It was exactly what I needed... variety. I didn't want to get two large portions of good and over eat. This was perfect on a cold Canada night. The service was quick, atmosphere was cozy, and the food was excellent and fresh. Everything tasted fresh and bursting of flavor. I actually wish I had this restaurant back home. The sampler plate was the highlight."
/user_details?userid=_MeA1exOjobDz9J6cGaglA,Nick G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm surprised this place doesn't get more reviews. I like the food they serve here. The bibimbap I ordered came with kimchi and soup. The food portion for the main course was quite large and filled me up quickly. I still left some room for the dessert, which was not what I was expecting in a good way. The ice cream sits at the bottom topped with shaved ice, matcha powder, and mochi rice balls. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because of the waiter. He was nice, but didn't seem to know much about the menu when we asked questions about certain courses."
/user_details?userid=q_oc5Gp5Cmmh9X5EGN6Irg,Dustin L.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Love this place especially the service and the ambiance. Fast and friendly service. I've known this place from friends and always have good experiences here so far. Highly recommend the pork bone soup. It is probably the best in town compare to the other Korean restaurant. Must Korean restaurant to try in downtown.
/user_details?userid=U5zHy7ZeBghPq0XeY4b0Fw,Kai Q.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"We stumbled upon this restaurant on Yelp during our brief stay in Montreal and decided to try it due to the proximity to our hotel. Thank goodness we did, because the food is truly top notch. The chicken katsu is incredible- perfectly seasoned and fried. The noodles were very well prepared as well. Prices were very reasonable. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=CUnPcNRfqs040C_9-0-a_g,Bhavyaa C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lovely Korean food with good portions for the price!  my friend and I both ordered jungshik a.k.a. meat sizzlers with side dishes (lettuce ssam, sauce, rice). The sizzler plate had a lot of great tasting meat, and the sides were fresh. We also received the typical small appetizers (potatoes, kimchi, and a mini omelette-type thing) and ordered a plate of regular kimbap to share. The kimbap was super fresh and tasty and complemented everything super well. The ambience is great and the seating is spacious and nice! I'm glad this place opened since other Korean places in the area (Kantapia, Atti) closed down, and I'll definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I havent had such good korean food in a while!! Everything ordered here is delicious and some of their specialties are the fried rice with egg (cooked in front of you) and the cheese corn. I found the corn a little bit bland and overly buttery but that's just me. Everything else was cooked to perfection and the flavours were great. The fried rice was so tasty and had great texture. The japchae is awesome as well! The servers are also super friendly and quick. I loved it here and I definitely recommend this place.
/user_details?userid=DEbR4SoGnmQSWDf518gK4A,Victor M.,"Daly City, CA",5 star rating,"Went to eat here today towards the end of our vacation.  We tried looking for Yelp reviews on this restaurant but could not find any so we did not try it until our hotel staff (Residence Inn - downtown - next door) recommended it.  We tried it this evening and was so glad that we will eat there on our last night tomorrow to try some of their other dishes.  The prices are very affordable compared to some of the Canadian, Italian and steakhouse restaurants during our stay.  For the two of us, we had a dumpling appetizer, bibimbap and japchae dishes and drank soju.  This was plenty for the 2 of us and the bill was only $53 USD, much less than the other restaurants we ate at.  If you are looking for an affordable Korean restaurant with great food, we recommend this.  They've only been opened a short time which is why they weren't on Yelp yet.  But as a vacationer from San Francisco, this was great Korean food and a change of pace after eating other Montreal cuisines.  The service was also great.  We walked by this restaurant every day and saw it frequented so we were glad we decided to eat here.  Hope you'll do so too!  They are not on Yelp yet but check out their website at Woorijib.com."
