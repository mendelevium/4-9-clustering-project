/user_details?userid=ijOZLZDhQZ7nLLig5Yhdeg,Gino B.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Downtown Montreal is packed with unique restaurants nestled in between one another; Iberica is no stranger to this concept on the Peel street strip between DeMaisonneuve and SherbrookeThe 2 level restaurant is entered through a red velvet curtain from the front door, perhaps to simulate a theater stage entrance or to serve as a dual cold air guard; interesting! Once you pass through the curtain, the dining room becomes the spectator seating where various cozy tables, full bar, an open kitchen and a second level are housed under a jaw dropping 20 foot urban chic open concept ceiling loft.The open kitchen is in plain view of the seating and appears quite simple, especially given the dozen of luxe tapas and menu items it churns out.  Fronting the cooks plate assembly area is a seafood ice box whereby fresh caught fish, oysters and mussels are in plain view of customers...very unique and another Nice touch.  Oh my!...the ceviche is so close I can taste it already!Iberica's post lunch Cocktail and wine list is impressive without being overbearing.  The tapas menu, which came in handy for this afternoon's light snack and drink meeting, is very diverse and today; we indulged in the decadent tomatoes and onion salad ($12) which had five kinds of yellow, red, green and orange tomatoe varieties, that were sliced with onions and filled with flavorful seasonings, olive oil, lemon, garlic; mmmmm mmmm mmm!!!... the dish was very fresh and light.  Next, the filet mignon medallions ($24) came sizzling in a personal skillet and were ultra tender, cooked to perfection All and all, Iberica offers a stunning space with a casual yet sophisticated level of service that is friendly and not intrusive; just what a business meeting or a slightly pricier date night would call for in the downtown core....mais oui,...of course!"
/user_details?userid=U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",3 star rating,"Iberica has an excellent atmosphere and vibe. Really nicely done and perfect for a date night. The service was also great, Mario was the best. He was so friendly, helpful and truly knowledgeable about all the dishes! Mario even plated our tapas styled plates for us and cut some of our food. He truly has excellent customer service and is a great guy. I wish the food was as awesome as Mario's customer service but unfortunately I felt that it fell a little short. Below is what I tried and my thoughts.-Scallops on pea purée, diced chorizo: you get three scallops, the dish itself is aesthetically pleasing and the scallops were ok. I liked them enough to eat them but didn't find them to be prepared exceptionally well.- Manchego cheese bread: the only description is ""Manchego cheese"" but the bread came out saturated in diced tomatoes and had raw pieces of Manchego cheese slapped on top. We are a tomato hating family so as soon as we saw it we were like ewwwwww. But even if we liked tomatoes, it is totally not what we were expecting. I would pass this up. We did send this back and it was taken off our bill, which we appreciate. - Beignets et croquettes - we tried the Lobster and shrimp fritters and they were tasty. Creamy and rich and satisfying, they came 4 to an order.- Grilled octopus: we are huge fans of grilled octupus and order it often. Unfortunately this octopus was not good, it was very tough and chewy, which means it was probably over cooked. Not enjoyable at all ...super disappointing.- Roasted cauliflower, preserved lemon, pine nut and pomegranate - this was my favorite dish of the night. Something about this cauliflower made it sooooo delicious. The pomegranate seeds gave it a nice flare as well. I would recommend this dish. I don't think I'd come back but I also wouldn't say it was a total fail. Perhaps just an off night. Nevertheless, we still had a good time and enjoyed ourselves. Somehow really good service makes up for sub par food, a little anyway."

I should have just ordered that.  Everything else was good, but not awesome. Not a huge beer selection, but we enjoyed the one they had.  Worth a try if the menu appeals to you."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"I was hanging out at my hotel bar one day chatting with the bartender about places I had eaten and a gentleman next me to chimed in. He told me about this place and how I needed to try it! The only thing better than good reviews on Yelp is a word of mouth recommendation, so I made sure that I bookmarked this place to check out. Here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: I came solo and sat right at the bar. It wasn't very busy on this Tuesday evening. The restaurant is quite elongated with multi-floor seating for the busier days. The decor is so lovely. The ceilings are so high so it gives this place a very spacious feeling. The 2 huge multi-piece square chandeliers are just a sight to behold. They're so cool and provide most of the lighting for the restaurant.Service: I can't remember the name of the young lady who took care of me, but she was excellent. Since I sat at the bar the service was extra quick. It also wasn't very busy, which I didn't mind. She smiled a lot, made sure I was taken care of and made my experience a good one.Food: This is a tapas style restaurant, which I love due to the small plates that allow me to try several different things all at once. First up was the ""Tomato Salad"". It was a simple seasonal tomato salad with olive oil and onions. It was fresh, flavorful and delicious. Next up were the scallops. There are 3 medium-sized scallops with Romesco sauce and diced chorizo right on top. They were excellent, but man I wish there were more of them. Lol. Next was the roasted cauliflower. It was served with pomegranate seeds and this incredible whipped... I don't even know what it was, lemon? I don't even know man. It was fantastic and unlike anything I had ever had before. Last, but not least was the beef tenderloin. It's just 3 small cubes of tenderloin with some crushed black pepper. They were excellent. This place didn't miss a beat, everything was absolutely excellent and I'm excited to try the rest of their menu!Value: All prices are in $CAD. Pretty decent. It's not terrible, but certainly not cheap. My tomato salad was $12.00. Scallops were $18.00. My seasonal cauliflower was $14.00 and tenderloin was $22.00. Not terrible, but quite expensive for someone eating all by themselves.In conclusion I loved it here. I will certainly return to try the rest of the menu! Check this place out if you're in the area."

If you're in the downtown core, this place is conveniently located.Now, let's address the not so good. I've visited 3 times. On my most recent visit, I took advantage of the daily lunch special, which was Paella w/ Grilled Octopus, Mussels and Chorizo. Unfortunately, while the dish was beautiful to look at, the Paella was underwhelming, lacked flavour and terribly under salted. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about my first visit - food included. I was so impressed that I suggested it for a friend's celebration dinner. When I visited again (with that friend), I found the food was just okay - nothing more. On my third visit, I was so underwhelmed that I felt the need to share it with you.In my opinion, the food here is not as good as it used to be. I'm disappointed because at their price point, the margin for error should be slim."

/user_details?userid=2g5qp1_2_iGDJI7hPcC8TQ,Andrew M.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,"Dinner here was a bit disappointing.  We thought, generally, the food was over-priced and mixed as far as quality.  The $50 steak was over-cooked and terrible (was billed as a ribeye but tasted more like an over-cooked sirloin).  Was also odd that this Spanish restaurant didn't have any olives... since those are such a staple in Spain.  The appetizers we got were good -- tomato salad, bread, charcuterie.  The lamb chops (main), though not cooked rare as asked, were still tender and tasty.  The large shared fish platter was like a deconstructed paella; beautiful jumbo shrimp.  The paella, in general, looked good (though we did not get it... but did get the rice with the fish dish).  It seemed that the ingredients were of high quality (except the steak) and the staff were nice. Atmosphere is industrial and modern and nice. Overall, not a good value proposition here.  (Also, apparently I checked in at the wrong Spanish restaurant and left a review there first--have moved the review here now.)"

/user_details?userid=XyJXNfsGNPLqI2c86jzPTw,Edmarie L.,"San Antonio, TX",5 star rating,"On vacation in Montreal we stumbled upon this restaurant. All I can say is WOW! If in the downtown area and looking for tapas then this is a must visit. It is not well advertised on the menu, but on the first page in the bottom corner they mention a tasting menu. The entire table has to agree and we are so glad we did. Our server asked our price range per person and the rest was up to the chef. It was a fun food adventure not knowing what the chef would decide to prepare for us. Let me tell you he did not disappoint. Our first course started with a delicious skillet of shrimp and toasted bread, the shrimp was cooked in a spicy smokey sauce perfect for dipping the bread. It was accompanied by diver scallops perfectly cooked and topped with a sun dried tomato and chorizo mix along with a romesco sauce. Our second course only increased our excitement, we were served filet mignon with grilled octopus and papas bravas. The steak was great but the highlight was the octopus and we'll it was prepared only to be punctuated by the spice of the potatoes. Not knowing where our meal was going we thought this was the highlight, we had no idea what the chef in-store for us. Our final course came with an entire red snapper perfectly pan cooked with seafood paella and some curried vegetables. The snapper was tender and so flavorful, and the seafood paella was chocked full of shrimp, cuddle fish, clams, mussels, and fish. We had no complaints and were so happy in what was prepared for us. In addition the service was fantastic. Our server and the food runners ensured we were well cared for, explaining each entree and serving each of us our portion. We recommend reservations, and our table was in the front window a perfect location with plenty of space for a party of 4."

Mario and Diane made my husband's 40th birthday dinner absolutely astonishing. They were very personable never missing a beat with excellent recommendations in terms of  wine and dishes they serve.  Mario and Diane made our dinner at Iberica worthwhile.  We shall definitely visit Montreal very soon and Iberica is one of the restaurants in the city we shall dine at again.:-)"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is fancy Spanish tapas and I like the location but honestly I've had better Spanish food elsewhere.The iberica caesar was awesome! It was spicy and salty and topped with an iberica ham chip and a deep fried anchovy. I then had a glass of Spanish red wine which was also very good.We started off with the coca con tomate which is a baguette cut up with tomatoes and olive oil and sea salt. I usually love this dish even though it's so simple. The bread was hard and I've had better tomatoes bread at other Spanish restos. Then we had the jamon iberica. This was very good. It legit melted in our mouth. The slices were very thin though. We ordered the mixed croquetas but instead of getting one of each we ordered two lobster/shrimp croquetas and two cod croquetas. They were both good but if I had to choose one I would suggest the cod. Next came the grilled octopus with Yukon gold  potatoes cut up in small cubes with lemon and oil. It was well cooked but some pieces were super salty. It's too bad because otherwise it would have been my favourite dish of the night. We also ordered the filet mignon tapas with black pepper sauce because the waitress recommended it. It was good but also salty but less salty than the grilled octopus. The filet mignon was supposed to be cooked medium rare but it was actually more medium. For dessert we had the chocolate beignet. I took half of one and was like "" nope, not worth the calories "" . My boyfriend said it wasn't sweet enough because it was dark chocolate but still ate the whole thing. lol It's a nice fancy Spanish resto but there are better Spanish restos in Montreal in my opinion."
/user_details?userid=CPICnRMxW4YJLKYyZXpGAg,Alishia S.,"Longview, WA",3 star rating,First and foremost - the server was absolutely stellar. She was on top of her game!As for the food...this menu has so much potential but the two dishes I tried were just a tish short. The cauliflower with homemade hummus lacked seasoning. While the piñons and pomegranate brought some wonderful notes the lack of seasoning was very evident. The buñuelos de mariscos were crispy and had a lot of favor but it was missing a wow element. Overall the experience was nice but not memorable.

/user_details?userid=AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went there with high expectations being such big fans of spanish tapas.First off, despite there being plenty of room in the back of the restaurant, we were made to sit in the front by the main door where we were constantly exposed to cold air. The décor is indeed stunning and the atmosphere nice. But the clientèle is on the older side, and snootier side.The menu at first glance looks amazing. Especially in terms of the number of vegetarian options.  We ordered the pan con tomate, the patatas bravas, the catalan spinach, the roasted vegetables with romesco sauce and the vegetarian paella. To say the least, we were very underwhelmed by the flavors. Which, unfortunately, is not in line with the concept of tapas.The true judge of a good tapas place is the success by which they undertake the pan con tomate. This one was essentially flavourless tomato on decent bread. The roasted vegetables were ok, the eggplant was raw inside, and there was a very minimal pocket of romesco sauce that did not wow the tastebuds. The spinach was awful, essentially just boiled and serve with a few raisins and pine nuts. Nowhere near the true dish that we have eaten many times in Spain and at other spanish restaurants. Patatas bravas were probably the best part, but that is being generous. Again only a minimal amount of sauce. Now the paella, tasted like minute rice with frozen vegetables and unflavoured tomato sauce topped with the same bland set of roasted vegetables as our other dish.The wine was decent, and the service good. However the food arrived much too fast, again going against the concept of tapas where you enjoy one or two dishes at a time and slowly get the other ones throughout the evening. The table next to ours received all their dishes at once, and so they were literally hanging over the edge of the table. But I suppose this is the restaurant's way to ensure rapid turnover.I would NOT recommend this restaurant and will definitely not be going back."

The bread was crispy and flavorful, the scallops were tender and perfectly cooked, and the ham croquettes were creamy and delicious. As a main my friend and I split the seafood paella, the seafood was wonderful but found overall it was lacking a bit in flavor. Would definitely come again for the great food, wonderful drinks, and top notch service!"
/user_details?userid=XfQloz-i6NywnjZl0OIzwA,Kim T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Beautiful chichi restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal. Decor and design was very trendy and nice.  It's a tapas place so do expect to spend a lot or leave the place still hungry. We order a lot of food (bill came out a little over $200) and our belly weren't really full. Food tasted good and the presentation was beautiful. But will we come back for the amount of food served versus the price paid. Probably not. I would say that the place next door (Ferreira Café) is 10X better!
/user_details?userid=tDZZ2WAPzJui4o8g1DWQjA,Yingcan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The first impression was very bad because of the lady at the entry with cold face. She brought me to the table. Then, she took my coat, gave me a tag for pick up coat and just leave without saying anything, not even a smile.Maybe it was because I was waiting for friends, no one talk to me or offer a cup of water for ten minutes...However, after five minutes, a waitress with a very warm smile asked me do I want to drink something. She also tried to help us find a bigger table because a friend decided to join us at the lastThe decoration in the restaurant is pretty fancy.The food and the wine is deeeelicious. But one thing the restaurant need to improve is the attention to wineglass. They gave my friend a champagne wineglass with a little damage that could hurt her mouth. Fortunately, she used other side of the wineglass before finding this issue.Despite those negative impressions, it is a good bistro for hanging out with friends."

There was a beautiful prix fixe menu which one of our party chose, and the rest of us selected many, many tapas and a few of the paellas. We feasted, literally for hours, and everything we had was excellent.   The menu was very extensive, and really, we enjoyed everything.  (One wish for a change - that the tuna were cooked slightly less, but honestly that is it.)Our waitress was as close to perfect as you could hope for.  I wish we could remember her name so we could compliment her justly (she just moved back east from out west).  After we ordered, she planned out which items to pair together, and she paired everything beautifully.  She was wonderfully attentive, and gracious.Best of luck to the owners - you've created a beautiful place with a warm, welcoming vibe, and a great menu.  Thanks for making New Years so nice for us!"

My first attempt showing up Friday night without a reservation didn't work so well so I made reservations the following weekend.The overall room has a good feel but its a tad narrow. The upstairs balcony has a more filled out room.As we received our cocktails the waiter suggested we go with the chef's menu which gave us the ease of not choosing and be surprised.We were served various courses with a selection of charcuteries, cheese, ceviche, octopus, squid, lobster tartare, lamb chops, vegetables, and seabass.The majority of the dishes were good but a couple like the squid failed.Mario took really good care of us with his natural charm and generosity.We very much enjoyed our time here and wish them good luck on their new business journey."

It's a beautiful place with lots of potential. The issue really is the quality of food, I expected much better than what I paid for. We had lobster, lobster and shrimp croquets, shrimp, patatas and more. The lobster was fresh, but had no taste. I had to ask for more butter and garlic, but by that time it was a lost cause. The wine was good, but all of the French wines were only available by bottle which sucked because my friends aren't big wine people so it was too expensive for me to get one alone. If you're looking for a beautiful venue then go here, but expect to be a little hungry and disappointed afterwards because it has so much potential."

/user_details?userid=i6E-Bn9qdCnGiAcNYjPWCg,Vincent Q.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"All style no substance AND we got ripped off. I don't usually leave reviews but this place was such a disappointment I had to leave one.First I have to say the restaurant itself is beautiful and the selection of ingredients is great.The beauty of the restaurant and emphasis on fresh Catalonian ingredients is misleading as it doesn't come together on the plate. The paella was lacking flavour. It needed some more salt and saffron or some kind of spice or fish broth or something tasty..this was bland. The rice was over cooked and the seafood was just ok, nothing worthy of the $60 price tag. The people I was with had the grilled seafood platter for two the seafood was alright. The side dish of rice was dry and tasteless. The fish in the platter was great BUT the waiter dared charge us an extra $15 over the advertised $95 price on the menu (this was advertised as a set price not market price)claiming that they gave us a bigger piece of fish than usual. That's a total rip off. If you advertise one price that's what it should be, I don't care that you decided to give us a bigger piece without asking us first. Looking at the pictures people posted of their platter it looks like we got the exact same size as everyone else. So their bigger piece explanation was Total BS. No one ever asked us at any time if we were ok with the surcharge before serving us. At no point was this ever brought up until the bill came. Yes $15 is not much but I wonder how many more clients they do that to. This felt like a total rip off. I wonder if they're trying to sneak in some surcharge for the Grand Prix weekend..at least be upfront about it. Already the meal itself wasn't that good and then they add a very sketchy fee on top. Also the waiter kept coming back speaking in English, which is fine with me but the people I was with are francophones. I would constantly answer the waiter in French and even told him to speak French for the other ones at the table yet he would leave and come back in English. Worst part is the waiter was francophone himself..this whole experience was ridiculous."
