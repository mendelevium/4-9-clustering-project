/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"How is it possible this place doesn't have 5 stars?? We've been twice in one week and it was because all week after having it once I kept gently slipping Da Silva back into our rotation of places to go to when we need non-home cooked meals. The place smells UHHHHMAZING. It's a masterpiece to behold so many chickens on a grill being lovingly babysat and turned by hand every so often. It is a fam owned business and they definitely have a welcoming, friendly, hearty vibe and service. Be warned that if you call later in the evening it gets busy so wait times can go from 10-15 mins to 45 mins later on. We ordered around 5pm and only waited 10 mins. Prices are very fair considering the portions and the FLAVORS. I'm sorry I'm using so many capitals but emphasis is needed. I wish I could just pass you this chicken sandwich and I guarantee you'll be typing in caps too. The chicken is their star and none other than the spicy chicken sandwich is the perfect vessel and embodiment of their genius. Usually chicken sandwiches are often too saucy or greasy and while yummy can be a bit overwhelming. This one was a revelation. It looks so ordinary but the crispy, light, fluffy bun, then the fresh butter lettuce, tart tomato, and assortment of some sort of pickles are peeeerfect with this spicy, juicy, charbroiled chicken. It doesn't need anything else, it's in a class of its own and perfect as it is. It was hard to share this with my husband and I had to remind myself how much I love him to begrudgingly hand it over and watch it disappear in big bites. The fries are like steak fries, thick but very well spiced, some crispy and some soggy. They're really addictive for some reason. Salad's nice and light (very fresh) with a very light dressing of what we think is olive oil and a dash of vinegar/acid. The chicken can be a bit dry in the drumstick but oh boy the rest is tender, juicy and spiced with bold flavors. It also tastes like a Montreal steak slice with fennel and some kind of spicy blend (we ordered spicy you don't have to but you should). A wonderful wonderful meal that nourishes body and soul. Thanks Da Silva!"

Incredibly easy to work with and they got our food ready on time!Mostly went with their quarter chicken breast, fries and salad. Chicken is great and fries are good but salad was quite oily. Also went with their pastel de natas and they were good but I'll admit I've had better.Overall a pleasure to deal with, would have appreciated if the food could gave been delivered by the street for the event."

/user_details?userid=Rbu8KWk_62Ud5xvpLfoYzQ,Food T.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Restaurant advertises that it closes at 9:00pm.  Went in at 8:15pm and was refused service because they were ""closing the grill at 8:30"".Came specially to try them out as a local alternative to Jano.They made my choice for me.  I'm not going to pick a restaurant that can't really be bothered, and neither should anyone else."
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"I'm new to Montreal, but I've already tried a few Portuguese chicken spots and Da Silva is definitely one of my faves. The fact that it's just a few blocks from our place makes it our go-to. Food-wise, I can only really comment on the combo (chicken, salad, and fries) and while the salad isn't much to gloat about, the fries are pretty solid and the chicken is the grand prize: not too greasy, and grilled just right for my taste. The family meal is also a pretty good option. The staff are wonderful too. One very important piece of advice, especially during peak (lunch and dinner) hours would be to order in advance over the phone. Trust me."
/user_details?userid=Ujju9P2yERI5Tu7clsOiSw,Jay F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Portuguese chicken I've had. I much prefer their approach (basting the chicken with sauce vs drowning it once cooked like Ramados). Makes for a crispy skin and a more charcoal flavour. It's a family run business, you'll be served by the owners who are very kind. A must try if you're a fan of Portuguese chicken. I certainly miss having it once or twice a week when my office was close by."
/user_details?userid=nqkSWxeteYkMKtSSFJr2pg,Sam E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious Portuguese chicken! It puts nearby barbecue chicken places to shame. The guys there are very friendly and even take the time to punch holes in their takeout containers so that the fries don't get soggy. Be prepared to wait at least twenty minutes as they grill your chicken (over charcoal) to order, but it's worth the wait."
/user_details?userid=ifBAyw26vmE7ciPOb1xwZQ,Natasha A.,"Kamloops, Canada",5 star rating,"SUPERB. I'd heard about this place, but only made it here when my usual sushi spot for lunch was closed for holidays - and I'm glad I did! I'd had Portuguese chicken only once before, and had been very disappointed, and reluctant to try it again. This is well seasoned, and delicious! I don't even like fries, and those are amazing! So glad I gave Portuguese chicken another chance, I'll definitely keep coming here. I've asked Yelp to update the address as they're now on Queen Mary!"
/user_details?userid=7NdPHZ_avhJqAfNO8dGeEw,Sabrina A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best Portuguese restaurant!!! They would give generous portion of the best Portuguese chicken in Montréal! You will come back for more and more.
/user_details?userid=hHWxBQUquz4wUwY5ck9JXw,Neil D.,"Saint-Sauveur, Canada",5 star rating,"I've eaten here several times. It's a small bland place but the food is out of this world. The Portuguese chicken is grilled fresh and is always juicy, the spicy sauce is just that, spicy. The plates are served with salad with a home made dressing and fresh cut fries with a seasoning. Recently I tried their hamburger and I was extremely impressed. The burger is grilled on the same grill as the chicken and couldn't be any better if you made it on your BBQ at home. All in all it's great food at very reasonable prices. My only suggestion is if you have a large order or are more that two people, call ahead."
/user_details?userid=JAIC-ZoDmAF4e52y3Tzvng,Jay G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,I love chicken and Portuguese chicken but this chicken is very dry!! They offer sauce on the chicken or on the side and both options are dry. Fries are decent but I'd rather go to Metro or CoteStLuc BBQ up the street to get a BBQ chicken
/user_details?userid=MyMtrDp8PYjKb5AVcIwoAQ,Hossein K.,"New Glasgow, Canada",5 star rating,"One the best Portuguese chicken places in Montreal! I tried the 1/4 chicken combo (breast, fries, and salad). Great spices and not dry at all (which is tricky when you grill chicken breast). The fries were pretty good as well. Definitely recommend it. Very friendly staff!"
