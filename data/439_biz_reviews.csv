/user_details?userid=sfIGgz__NRRNvUB5tlg0CQ,Dave S.,"Waikanae, New Zealand",5 star rating,"Incredible meal and phenomenal service. We all had the 3 course meal for $35. There are some extra charges for things like the scallops but great value and each course was a visual as well as gastronomic feast. 3 of us had the rabbit saddle for an entree. Delicious flavours and beautiful presentation.  Our 4th person had Indian mussels with a curry salsa. Fish of the day for main had rave reviews as did the chicken Ballantine, and the scallops were also a hit. 5 small dessert petit fours after finished the meal with a flourish. An amazing meal and experience."
/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Daniel B.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"We were looking to get a nice dinner in downtown Montreal and chose Accords Le Bistro over Cadet and were glad we did. This restaurant was great, not only in terms of food, but in terms of service and atmosphere too. We really enjoyed our experience here.When we showed up to Cadet on a Thursday around 8:15pm, the place was packed, loud, and there was a wait. We didn't want to wait so we walked around the corner to Accords where we were seated immediately.Right away, I liked Accords because of the atmosphere. Unlike Cadet, we felt relaxed and comfortable inside Accords. We could actually hear each other talk. As for the restaurant space, it was elegant and beautiful with vaulted ceilings, pendant lighting, and a glass-enclosed wine cellar. The place has a modern, sophisticated look to it. There's sidewalk seating and, the night we visited, the weather was pleasant so the dining room's sliding glass doors were kept open, adding to the already-cool ambiance. Accords is a wine bar too with a ""privately-imported"" organic wine selection.They had great deals for dinner. We could get a three-course dinner for $40 (+$35 with wine pairings), four courses for $50 (+$45 wine), and five courses for $60 (+$55 wine). All Canadian dollars. These kinds of prices for this quality of restaurant (""fine"" dining) are unheard of in big American cities. For the multi-course dinners, there were 13 dishes to choose from in five categories. If ordering a multi-course dinner, no more than one dish from each category could be selected. A la carte, these dishes ranged anywhere from $10-42 each. Two dishes, the pan-fried foie gras and duck breast, had a $14 upcharge if ordered as part of a multi-course dinner.Additional offerings included oysters from Prince Edward Island (market price), shareable dishes ($7-16) like fries and porchetta, local Quebec cheeses (one for $5, four for $20), and desserts ($10-14). One of my friends ordered the oysters and the market price for six was $17.Here's what I had:Three-course meal ($40)* Poultry liver mousse, carrots bread, confit onion* Pan-fried foie gras, gingerbread, candied fruits, honey (+$14)* Fish of the day (pan-seared pollock), smoked ratatouille, goat cheese ""La Beurrasse""Dishes to share* Fries with mayo and ketchup ($7)Dessert* Fruit sorbet ($10)Wine* Sorelle Palazzi, Podere Il Ceno, Chianti Colline Pisane, 2017 bottle ($62)Overall, the meal was wonderful. There wasn't a single bad dish. Presentation was outstanding. I did find it odd/interesting that they served the poultry liver mousse as the third course in my three-course meal. Classified as an ""amuse-bouche"" on the menu, I expected it to be served as the first or second course, not the last one. That said, the dishes came out in the same order that I ordered them. If you prefer a particular order, I'd let the server know.The poultry liver mousse was less of an amuse-bouche and more of a small plate or appetizer. It was three or four good bites, not one (amuse-bouches I've had in the past were typically one or two bites). It consisted of a dark, thick, soft slice of carrot bread topped with a generous spread/dollops of chicken liver mousse, slices of carrot, preserved onion, mustard seeds, and some crunchies (to provide contrasting texture; I forget what they were). The mousse was smooth, rich, and flavorful. I liked it a lot.My favorite dish was the pan-fried foie gras. There was a generous serving of foie gras placed atop a slice of lightly toasted gingerbread and large, ripe peach slices. There were other fruits too, but the peaches stood out. They were terrific -- juicy and sweet. The foie gras was perfectly cooked. Like the liver mousse, it was rich and flavorful, and went really well with the bread and fruit. Overall, the dish had a nice sweetness to it, but it wasn't too sweet. If you like foie gras, I think this is a must-order.The pan-seared pollock with smoked ratatouille and goat cheese ""La Beurrasse"" was OK. Not bad. If I ever came back here, I don't think I would order it again nor would I recommend it. The flavors just weren't there for me. Still, it was a beautiful dish with quality ingredients. It seemed to be missing something that I can't put my finger on.The fries with mayo and ketchup -- just your standard fries. Large, crispy, and some with the potato skins still on. They're almost like pub fries or the kind of fries you get with fish and chips, but not as big/thick. Generous helpings of creamy mayo and yummy ketchup.The fruit sorbet was fantastic. It was apple sorbet and there were two scoops served on a plate over some crunchy/crumbly bites (not sure what it was). You can't go wrong with the sorbet for dessert.Our server was a young dark-haired man with glasses named William. He was very kind and attentive, quick to refill drinks and respond to any request we had. An older gentlemen, who looked like a manager type, was also quite hospitable. He warmly saw us in and out."

/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,"Highly impressed! Would definitely recommend, would definitely return! Came here for a McGill Alumni Wine Tasting and Pairing event with my dad on a warm and rainy Wednesday evening. The Bistro's two Sommeliers were spectacular and endearing. Both down to earth, friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about every one of the 5 Austrian wines they presented and paired thoughtfully with perfectly conceived bouchées. This event was geared at the seasoned wine connoisseurs and the amateurs, such as myself, alike. I was enthralled in a panoply of information and sensations and I would gladly repeat the occasion a million times over.In particular the duck confit croquettes were to die for, my favorite taste of the night! Also of particular note, would be the dessert wine, which was out of this world; and we were among the last people to get to savour it here in Québec, as we had the last 3 bottles only available via import. The service was impeccable and unwaivering. The price was definitely on the higher scales but worth every penny. I can't wait to go back for a tasty treat and a very good well sought glass of wine!"

The muahroom butter tastes wonderful and the service top notch. I highly recommend this reataurant. 5 stars."
/user_details?userid=DzYxzYKFUsPiry1p4I1E8g,Ernest H.,"Aptos, CA",5 star rating,"We really liked this place! Food was excellent and unique. The food pairings and seasons were interesting and delicious. We arrived at a busy time for dinner but the Maître de would not seat us, not because there were no tables, but because she did not have enough staff to serve a proper dinner, a nice touch! We waited until the Restaurant cleared a little, and were seated for an excellent meal. The waiter spoke excellent English and French. We had the chief's choice dinner. 3 courses all unique. Each item was fully explained as it was served. The meal was $45 CD per person, wine extra. A great value in my opinion. This restaurant also has a second location in the old Montreal Port area, with the same format. it was also excellent."
/user_details?userid=-G2yLi-qli5HuXED-gY62A,Mark M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"For any out of towners or locals alike, this place is definitely worth a try. The chefs tasting menu is not for the unadventurous, but the flavors that takes ones palette on a journey throughout the meal is for every foodie out there. The price is unbeatable with the wine pairing, which compliments each course beautifully. HIGHLY recommended!"
/user_details?userid=95h8tdQOG_bAET7FiHfEWQ,Rey C.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"I've returned to Accords and nothing has changed...and I mean this in a very yummy and delicious way.    The seasonal menu changes look amazing.  I had the octopus (again), but this time dressed up with a potato purée and chunks.  Very delicious.  The orange wine!  The orange wine!  Must try.   Finally, the service staff - Shaun Audrey and Serge - are amazing.  Overall, a wonderful third experience. Til next time."

/user_details?userid=3QRWohrd5N7Ez-nUoEAUnw,Matthew M.,"FL, FL",5 star rating,"This was my first time in Montreal on the occasion of my 40th birthday. This was luckily my first stop. On happenstance, I found this place on Google and decided to pop in for dinner. Full disclosure, I am a chef, which makes me typically the absolute most obnoxious kind of critic. I have to say, however, the food here is absolutely outstanding. The boudin with bok choy and mustard was perhaps one of the best bites I've had in some time (sorry guys, I might steal that one). The oyster mushroom risotto was flawless; creamy, delectable, and perfectly executed. The atmosphere is sophisticated without being pretentious. The staff are all friendly, bilingual (I only speak english and spanish, and they were more than accommodating). I cannot recommend this place enough, from their exceptional knowledge of wines and local cocktails to their passion for farm-to-table and local, sustainable food, this is a must-visit when you are in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=fR0TCuQCL1TaZCZrWJFYrg,Max C.,"Morrisville, PA",1 star rating,"I do not think I ever had such bad experience with any food place. Ordered the ""tasting menu"" with a glass of wine. The tasting menu consisted of some juvenile experiments with some-what rotten products. The glass of wine smelled like cat litter box, i am not sure if they did some-thing to that half open bottle of wine or glass itself, but i still can't forget that smell.Never ever again I will go to that place, nor recommend it to any one. Stay away."
/user_details?userid=ukvAspT1zd47vKTeZmV9XQ,Zhanna R.,"Princeton, NJ",1 star rating,Looked good inside but very disappointing food :(  and wine pairing was the worst I ever had... boxed wine is better . I would not recommend it.
/user_details?userid=G6HW7nzfAGgKIJh-jYOIZQ,Jamie K.,"Kansas City, MO",5 star rating,"The best dinner experience in Canada. We had the chefs choice, only the second week they've done this, and I had the wine pairing with it. Best choice we've made here. The whole meal was an unforgettable experience. Tons of food, great local ingredients and local wine. I wish I could eat here every week. Save your $ and take a nice night to enjoy this place."
/user_details?userid=rlWqllUqgpWK067GPp6_0w,Christine S.,"Underhill, VT",4 star rating,"Delicious.  As for service, I've never before had the waitress put down menus and then start explaining upwards of eight individual entrees as in-depth as this - I was quite parched and really wished we could have been served some water before the lecture began, but I appreciate the attention.  There was a nice selection of local draft beers; we bypassed the tasting menu and ordered three individual plates.  For two people, three or four such plates are necessary.  The burrata was outstanding, a delicious and generous amount of cheese on a tasty bread artfully decorated with flowers.  The homemade pasta and the fish of the day were well executed.  The desserts were lovely.  I consider this to be an expensive restaurant, but worth it."
/user_details?userid=s6nIyADt_Xea5aPOG4Q7aA,Jaime S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,A delightful gem that we discovered! The 5-course meal with wine pairing is the absolute thing to do here. And at $75 CAD - it is quite a deal. Dined outside and everything was prepared to perfection for a Summer's night. The farm to table vegetables had an overpoweringly fresh flavor. Absolutely delicious. Now the city of Montreal should just close off the adjacent road and leave only foot traffic - and the experience would simply be perfect!

/user_details?userid=GSG9d8WxU2XNd5odUw_U9Q,Alex P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3 star rating,"Atmosphere is good. Food was average. I had a chicken with mushrooms and beans, friends had pasta and flank steak. The consensus was food was good but nothing spectacular. Service was good but the wine recommendation was pretty bad. We ended up paying around $70-$80 each with a cocktail and a bottle of wine. I can have a pretty awesome dinner for that price at many other comparable restaurants. So three stars is fair, a good place to socialize with friends not to have a great dinner, at least not for what you will have to pay. Staff could use some education about wine pairing."

/user_details?userid=d1vT0pSJ3OFVmqg5UhbxoA,Paula Y.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Best and most tender octopus we've ever had! Service was excellent and so were the main courses  (flank steak for hubby and local fish for me). Chocolate ganache dessert was not too sweet and a great way to end our meal.
/user_details?userid=5Bs7gusydtazJcoYzLsFvw,Janet K.,"Astoria, NY",5 star rating,"This meal was a treat. Perfect for more refined, elevated French food--""foodie"" in quality and vision without the stuffiness. Perfect portions, plentiful bread and really great service.  The desserts were as good if not better than the food (which is rare!!) and had probably the best octopus I've ever had. Very reasonably priced considering the quality of the food and wine we got. Will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=swtCVoZKBMeIUs4v3Gy2yQ,Sydney W.,"Cicero, NY",1 star rating,"My friends and I had a pretty awful experience while here... We came to get a couple of appetizers and some drinks while on a weekend getaway from Central New York. We sat down in the outside seating area where we were given food menus and a cocktail menu. When a waiter came over, he asked us if he could take our drink and food order, and we told him that we wanted four cosmos, although needed a little bit more time to figure out our food choices. While explaining this to him, he rudely gathered our menus and took off. A different waiter came to give us our drinks, which were tasty, but our original waiter never came back to get our food order. When he finally came back about a half hour later, he was only there to give us our check. The kicker is, in the United States, we leave the tip on the table after the check is paid. Although, when we had paid the bill, our waiter actually came back to the table requesting that he was given a tip. We explained to him that we were used to just leaving it on the table and that that is what we planned on doing, but he just rolled his eyes at us and walked away. We were shocked by the horrible service. Would never recommend or go back."
