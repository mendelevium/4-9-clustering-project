/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cafe Sfouf, you are pretty great. Good call on participating in this edition of the indie coffee passport, otherwise I might never have discovered you. The space is beautiful, with an industrial vibe to it similar to replika, and huge windows that open on warm sunny days. There's even a kids' corner, something I will come back to take advantage of when my little guy is bigger. I didn't try any of the food, but it must be delicious. Everything was well presented and appetizing.I tried a ""lait d'Or"", or golden milk, a steamed milk infused with tumeric and other deliciousness, and it was exactly what I wanted. Warm and comforting like a coffee, but without caffeine, a little bit spicy but so much, like chai's mellow cousin."

The decor and plants make it a very nice spot to get work done, there's even a kids area with toys. There's several outlets scattered near the walls, and it is very well lit as well. I love how all of the drinks come with a little tea cake. What really turns me away from the place are the amount of flies!! Came 3-4 times during the summer and it was nearly impossible to get work done with the amount of flies buzzing around you, landing on your desk/drinks, etc. Couldn't even get a 1 minute break . If this issue was addressed it would be a great place"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",4 star rating,"First time here and i love it! A little cafe on a street corner,with a rustic and cozy feel. First thing that caught my eye was the plant wall; cute and very ""instagramable"".Every drink comes with a little turmeric cake (both delicious&healthy). It's a little small, gets packed really fast. So if you decide to check it out, go early! Closest metro is about a 10 min walk (Beaudry metro).At the doors they added a dome like plastic cover, which helps isolates the cold when someone opens the door,really well thought out for people inside.They even have a little play area for kids called ""Le Petit Sfouf"" such an adorable name!Love the big garage doors! Definitely coming back in the summer,when both doors are open and the sunshine's through.Downfall: There aren't that many wall plugs."

Gaby and Mel will make you feel at home! An awesome place to meet a friend or stay hours for studying...Dis I mention the food? You won't be able to forget about the delicious Tartines!
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",2 star rating,"Cute little neighborhood café. It seems like each and every customers are regulars. The industrial-like design with used & refurnished furniture, i'n not so sure. Sitting on  a chair that seems on the brim of falling apart is not my favorite part but the coffee is nice. I was told to wait before ordering and then bluntly asked why I haven't ordered yet. There was some back and forth of awkwardness that was really unnecessary. Lady, I just want a coffee."

/user_details?userid=LkhDqR1y_tqOv3AiSqnLOg,Agape H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Wonderful service! The owner is the kindest woman. The locals love this place too whether it's evening on a weekday or Saturday morning. I got an americano with a splash of milk and it was not your regular Starbucks coffee. Very affordable and rich in flavor! WiFi works well and it's a wonderful place to study/get out of the house in the winter.
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love the vibe at this café. The staff is super nice and laid back. Just the way it should be when you sip your coffee or tea :). Me, I love their ""lait d'or"". It's a turmeric tea that they sweetened with honey. I love mine made with almond milk. They also offer a Sfouf mignardise with your hot drink. Delicious! I haven't tried out their food yet but It's made on the premises. They close early though (6pm everyday)."
/user_details?userid=cY4gShiuzFVRRfUbbdrr2Q,Masha E.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,one of the best cafes in Montreal to study/work. The ladies work here are extremely nice. Great selections of coffee and snacks. My go to cafe to a quiet study place.
/user_details?userid=Mg8P-Sw04XtNAPX6gAGx8Q,Christina C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I could spend hours at Sfouf. The decor is perfection and they tartines are so good! Simple but flavourful. I love their lattes. The owner is lovely and friendly! Nothing bad to say here!@cchehade
/user_details?userid=QQoJ94IlLIG-162eLsT7Yg,Courtney K.,"Stratham, NH",5 star rating,One of my favorite chai lattes in the city and my favorite spot to-date for a delicious bowl of soup. Charming and bright atmosphere and decor. I could (and have) stayed for hours and hours.
/user_details?userid=wb_BRhsZh0b3s3yQA14jkw,Tiffany H.,"Flushing, NY",5 star rating,"Lovely Lebanese cafe located in Gay Village. The staff is welcoming and friendly, and the interior is very nicely decorated as well. It's decorated simply, and in a corner, there is a beautiful display of a shelf/ rack of potted plants.It's a great spot to read and work, or just catch up with friends. There's music playing in the background, but it's pretty quiet. They also have free wifi! Their matcha latte is delicious, and each drink comes with a complimentary petit sfouf, which is a Lebanese cake made with semolina flour, sugar, turmeric, and pine nuts, which was very tasty as well. They offer some pastries, including sfouf, cake, donuts, and scones. They also offer a variety of tartines, either sweet or savoury. I opted for the zabneh, zaatar, mint tartine, which came with a side of salad. I'm unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food, but the staff was friendly enough to explain/ show me what everything was (Labneh is cheese made from yogurt, and zaatar was a combination of herbs). The tartine was delicious and very flavorful. They also have a  brunch option, which many people had opted for. Portions looked very generous and it looked really good. Definitely coming back soon to try it !"
/user_details?userid=pV5yh55j12SWmipNv53qsQ,Thea M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The labneh and za'atar is authentic and SO good! Everything is fresh and decently priced. It does get crowded on the weekends but people cycle through pretty quickly. Lovely place to study, perfect ambiance with many plants!"
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Sometimes it takes me several visits to make up my mind about a place. Here it's the opposite. I stepped in, was greeted by friendly staff, charmed by the sunny, hip, vibrant atmosphere, and decided that I definitely like the place. Then, the cappuccino and cookie just confirmed it. I like the green plants everywhere, the large tables that maximizes space for patrons, the vintage feel, the ""petit Sfouf"" corner for kids, and the fact that it is out of my usual new neighborhoods. Great discovery."
/user_details?userid=EayT7EqEYuiYE7vegzbs7A,Hema P.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Lovely spot for lunch. Labneh and za'taar is excellent and so is their liat d'ore -- oh delicious! Low key space.. lots of people work with their laptops here.
/user_details?userid=fzCFYwjrTyvCKoecPuq3Bg,Shauna F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cosy atmosphere with an artsy vibe. There is a children's corner with toys. However, the food is a bit pricey for what it is (standard sandwiches and such)."
/user_details?userid=Ex-QoUxevVpBPsovXWb8cw,Naoufel T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I live next door from this Cafe, it is one of my favorite in the neighborhood for sure. I love the fact they have plenty of light, in the summer they open one side of the cafe so you feel you are sitting in a terrace. The food is decent, the coffee is pretty good."
/user_details?userid=i_4JP5Co6WZqgoPHnIPh4g,Bertha F.,"Portland, ME",2 star rating,"Has great potential, were it not for the horrible 90s music the staff plays and (get this!) whistles along to.  If I return, it will be with high quality noise-cancelling headphones."
/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lovely cafe in the upper Plateau where they've got great sweets (better than the actual coffee). One sweet in particular is an Arabic dessert. You'll know what it is by its orange colour, a natural hue from the tumeric in the recipe. Give it a try! This is a pretty quiet spot, great for reading, and kid-friendly too."
/user_details?userid=iuZAf1pyuMBzND_2aAmZJg,Lavi L.,"Ridgewood, NY",4 star rating,"Decent spot for coffee! Great on a rainy day or anytime you feel like reading a book, staring out the open window, using their wifi (if you are international) or simply catching up with friends. Quality of the latte was on par with my expectations and I'm honestly surprised this place doesn't get more love on Yelp. About $4.50 for a cappuccino but found that's typical for Montreal."
