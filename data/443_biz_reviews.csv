/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My go to for a club sandwich.I know it might come off as weird as it's a burger place but I don't LOVE their burgers but the club sandwich on the other hand is delicious.Came Tuesday afternoon around lunch time, the place had a few people in it not very busy so we grabbed a table downstairs and got our menus. We knew exactly what we wanted but decided to check out the appetizers.We started off with the fried pickles with the lemon aioli. There was 4 pickles not very big as it's just one pickle cut in 4 I think 8$ is a little pricey. On uber eats they are 9$.We got a pitcher of moose head and listened to some great tunes while we waited for our delicious clubs.The chicken is very juicy and spiced up nicely and they chop up the chicken instead of throwing a huge slice In there. The bacon is crispy just the way i like it. Love the bread the most tho so good ! They put enough mayo that you don't have to worry about it being dry and boring. It comes with fries and a pickle.Great customer service and yummy food."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I tried the brunch here and it was comparable to the other NBG location. I was surprised that the restaurant was pretty empty at 11am on a Sunday. Perfect for a hangover brunch. Lots of options but the flavour profile is kind of the same throughout (salty,heavy..etc..) Probably not the best place for something like an açai bowl but that's not their vibe so it's ok! I really enjoyed the challah French toast, just wish it was a little warmer. I wish they included some fruit with each meal. Just an orange slice or two could really brighten up the dishes.Notably, our waitress was amazing. I don't know her name but she had short hair?? She was super friendly and quick.Anyways, very convenient location and no wait on a Sunday. For those reasons, I'll probably be back"
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for brunch with a group of ten people and had a GREAT experience. The service was crazy quick - faster than any other time I've gone to a restaurant with this big of a group. The servers got all of our orders perfect and they were super kind when taking our orders and bringing our food. We were in and out within an hour and fifteen minutes. The food itself was crazy delicious. I've gone to another one of this franchise's locations for dinner before and it was superb. As a result, i was expecting the same deliciousness for their brunch and I was NOT disappointed. I got the Avocado Eggs Benny and I substituted the salami for bacon. My oh myyyy!!! Absolutely delicious. I've had a lot of eggs benedicts in my brunching experience and these were up there as one of the best. Would 100% order this again (and again and again). I highly recommend!"

The server was so nice and very helpful. I ordered Holy Swiss with house fries on the side. It was so gooooooood! Server offered if we want ketchup and mayo, she really knows what's best match with fries! I love my experience all in all and it was my first time here. Would definitely come back!"

It's great for big groups. The service is always great. And the food is delicious.They have a good selection of burgers, but for whatever reason you're not happy with their selection, you can create your own with your choice of patty.Their patties are made in house so you can ask for your meat cooked as you please. I like seeing red in mine.With different locations across the island, you have no excuse not to try them out."
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far one of my fav burger joints. This spot not only gives you the option to customize your own burger, but your own poutine as well! They have various great sauces, like their tandoori mayo and lemon aioli which are must try's! Me and my friend decided to create both a burger and a poutine, a simple BLT beef burger with spicy mayo with a tater tots poutine topped with spicy mayo sauce with sweet potato fries on the side. Although the place was busy, the food arrived very quickly. The burger was cooked perfectly and the ingredients tasted very fresh! The burgers and the poutine were simple but delicious. As for the sweet potato fries, they were fried perfectly too, being crispy outside and soft inside, and came in a generous portion great for sharing! Overall, this is a great burger joint in downtown! Great staff, good food and a reasonable price! It's also great for groups, and during spring or summer, they have a hidden terrace in the back which is perfect for outdoor eating."

However HERE was a different story ... we decided to sit outside and the waitresse literally asked me to leave my stroller WITH my baby inside ( he is only 6 months and clearly looks like a baby) outside of the railing because ""it wouldn't fit next to me"" I lost my mind!! You dont need to have kids to know that THAT is not okay!  Some clients who were sitting outside couldn't believe what she was asking me to do! They were so shocked .. I had to move chairs around to make it work! All it takes is a little creativity and a heart! Already that blew my mind but I decided to stick to what I came for & dismiss her completely..We took the game changer. It was really good! & delicious!! Perfectly cooked and well combined! Definitely recommend it .. but never going back to this location."
/user_details?userid=U5YNgTOEW48PFHmpYl229A,Chelsea D.,"Southwick, MA",5 star rating,Ate here on a whim while visiting the city. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding - one of the best burgers I've ever had. Everyone there was super friendly and answered all our questions. It's hip without being obnoxious; tastefully decorated and fun music playing. The place is small and the tables are close together which may bother some people but we did not feel cramped. I hope they are still here the next time we visit!
/user_details?userid=UCqsm9FfQ-xOw1GIrFHj-Q,Vi S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After coming here a few times, I feel confident that Nôtre-Boeuf-de-Grâce is one of my favourite brunch and burger joints. The space: 10/10Walking into the restaurant, you'll be greeted by a mannequin that looks a little to real for comfort. The quirkiness of the restaurant is something that I don't see often. The space has a nice ambiance during the day, relaxing yet bubbly. It feels very ""Montreal"". During the summer, they have a terrace and being able to sit outside to enjoy brunch (or lunch) is a great experience. The service: 10/10 The wait staff are incredibly friendly and helpful when it comes to the menu. They really make the experience worthwhile. Everyone that I've been served by have been able to ask any question I asked, whether it be about the menu, food preferences, or the actual restaurant itself. The food: 9/10 Why only nine out of ten? It's not because the food is bad, but au contraire, the food is amazing. Usually whenever I eat here, I am neither too full or left wanting more. I am usually just satisfied (basically I can still stand up after eating).One day, my boyfriend and I decided to brunch here, par usual, and we decided to go for the Challah French Toast. When it arrived, we were both disappointed. It may just be that we're used to more than just two pieces of fried chicken, but compared to the abundance of toast, the amount of fried chicken was disappointing.Food I've tried:Challah French Toast: 8/10 (portion sizing)JD's Classic: 9/10 (pretty standard breakfast)The Last Brunch Sandwich: 10/10 (was amazing and flavourful, I recommend it)The Hangover Poutine: 8/10 (was not the best poutine I've ever had, but the caramelized onions and the egg made up for it)Biblical Brie: 10/10 (was truly biblical, trust me, you gotta experience it)Holy Swiss: 10/10 (not gonna lie but their burgers are truly holy and their buns are amazing. never had buns this good)Thou Shalt Bacon Cheeseburger Sr: 11/10 (my favourite burger, it's a true artery clogger but I would gladly choose it as my last meal)Jerk Fries: 12/10 (I would eat a mountain of these if I could. the flavouring is phenomenal and by far the best jerk fries I've ever had.)Bottomless Mimosas: 100/10 (I am an avid mimosa indulger, and these bottomless ones are the bomb dot com)"

It reminded me a lot of Burger Royal because you could choose the size and the burgers don't come with the fries. The meat is juicy and tasty. I made my burger with avocado and it was so goooooooood. Fresh and well presented. I just wish they had a mac and cheese burger :PSeating is ample and comfortable. Service is fast and people are friendly. Honestly, a really great burger place."

A friend and mine decided to do brunch as we were overdue on catching up... we decided to try NotreBoeuf de Grâce for brunch. Our waitress Chelsey made for a pleasant experience and was attentive to our needs.Food was DELISH... it's like the chef knew that I was there because the food was Made with love ! (Just as I love it!) I had the breakfast sandwich and requested an add on of avocado! The sandwich was filling and prepared to perfection. My plate came with 'mashed/shredded' potatoes which I couldn't even finish thats how satisfying my sandwich was.My mimosaS... (insert shy face) were on point...My friend's smoked salmon platter was also prepared to perfection... she got several slices of fresh salmon, salad, bagel, capers and I believe crème fraîche...Overall Amazing service and great food!The place is CLEAN which is super important to me.

Eggs not cooked the way anyone asked for. Hashbrowns were so over fried they were rock solid. Couldn't even stab them with your fork. Coffee was never re-filled unless we asked for a top up. This place looks like it has potential from the outside, but it's extremely clear that is but a facade. Will not be back - don't waste your time or money here folks there are too many wonderful and infinitely higher quality places to dine in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for a brunch! I ordered the one with the bread, two poached eggs on top with avocadoes.  Then, I went crazy with the drinks; orange press, milkshakes and orange juice. I had a bit of trouble with the first server. I think I have an accent or something. I don't know. Everything is pretty healthy to eat and I didn't think I add 5 more pounds after today. The food is great. I love the concept of having anything I want in the menu. Overall, I didn't come in a 9 am because of my hangover from last night supper.  It was still worth the trip over there because everything is so good. It is on my list of brunch place to go"

It has a nice terrasse, I'd definitely recommend sitting outside when the weather permits it. P.S. The mannequin at the front entrance ALWAYS scares me, so beware when you're walking by.FOOD: Call me crazy, but I got the salad. At a burger joint. And I liked it! My friend also got the salad and seemed to enjoy it. We also got the lychee sangria and it was really good as well. Next time, I'll be sure to come here to try a burger. I wish the portions were a bit bigger though. PRICE: A tad bit expensive, but considering the area, I'm not too surprised. SERVICE: The service was good. Staff are friendly and are efficient.

We orderd a 9 oz burger and the meet was raw as if you just take it out of fridge, grill it for 30 sec each side and put it in the burger. No kidding!9 oz is a thick piece of meat, but at least medium?I could see the strings of raw ground meet... it's so disgusting to remember..I told the waitress and she was suprised to see the meet like that, but just a simple ""sorry"" and took it for extra grilling, but again it was raw as hell! They didn't change my dish, they didn't even give us any offer to make it up. Not even asked us if we were happy at the end. They just passed us the bill.Is this a fair customer service?.."

That's a little bit surprise but in a good way. For drinks, I got orange juice, which is vey fresh. Then after meal, I took a latte. I forgot to stir a little bit before drinking...so...it was so bitter for the first try. But then it became more and more mellow and savory! I was so happy that I didn't throw it away in the beginning.  Lol."

Decor is nice and they have two large TVs - one with a basketball game and the other with a hockey match playing. We ordered 2 B.G. Blonde beers and 2 B.G. Classics with fries. The beers arrived quickly. The burgers were nothing special - dry meat (even though they say they cook their burgers 'pink') and mealy tomatoes. We got their special sauces for the fries which were good - I especially liked their spicy mayo. Service was OK, our waitress did not once check in on us, but the other servers were generally friendly and helpful when we needed something.All-in-all, I could make a better burger at home, but they did use a nice quality beef."

I was warmly greeted and the server kindly understood the state I was in, hungry(hangry almost) with just 20 minutes between appointments. She didn't know me, she just treated everyone with a high level of thoughtfulness, I watched her do it repeatedly as I chilled at the bar and ate.  I ordered a veggie dog and didn't get the slightest reaction from what is admittedly kind of a weird order in a place with Beef in the name. It came out quick and the cook came to check in and chat quickly about veggie dogs. The texture of the dog and the bun were fresh and great and I was happy with everything. Happiest of all with the warm happy vibe between the staff and customers. NBG provided a calming break from an annoying afternoon, I'm thankful this spot is available for harried humans in the area."

I have to admit that neither of us got a burger at a place that specialized in burgers but that's because their menu was so much more than burgers. I went with Samson's Lox which was probably the best smoked salmon sandwich that I've ever eaten. Packed with salmon, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and capers on an onion bun. I had trouble fitting it in my mouth. Delicious. The other sandwich we got was a make your own veggie burger in a lettuce wrap with avocado, aioli and grilled pineapple. Also huge and very yummy. I had the best drink of our trip there - lychee sangria. Woah. They had a ton of beers on tap. The waitresses were all super helpful. The only negative was that they randomly started blasting (and I do mean blasting) the stereo and it was so loud that you couldn't reasonably chat with someone sitting next to you and had to yell. No idea who wants music that loud. Prices and food quality were really great. It's in a busy area but there was no wait and plenty of seating. It's a must visit on our next trip to Montreal."

I did not ask for this to be taken off the bill but clearly stated I did not want to drink it.  I instead ordered the house blonde beer which was half way palatable.   I had 1/3 of it.  The old fashioned was still on the bill.Service:  4/10.  The bartender was responsive but the server (a thin, tattooed woman) could not bring herself to smile if her life depended on it.  Despite there being so little customers we found ourselves having to flag down staff and no one asked how our meals were.We were in Montreal for 5 days - this was by far and away the worst experience.  The owner did come in and put up some plants to spruce up the place - I wish he had a few minutes to inquire how we were enjoying our food and experience so we could have provided some direct feedback"
