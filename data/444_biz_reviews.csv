/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In this review, I hope to shed light on this shady looking restaurant. I had this bookmarked for two years and only recently visited the place. It still only has one Yelp review. Small restaurant (that probably gets more visits from parents of preschoolers than hungry customers because it looks like a daycare from outside -- will elaborate) serves a variety of delicious Chinese food near LG metro station. Food:Hot and Sour Glass Noodles (5/5): Balanced spicy and sour noodle soup with a touch of minced pork and pickled veggies. The best I've had in metropolitan Montreal.Fried Chicken Cutlet (4.5/5): Comparable to Taiwanese chain Hot Star but comes with a lower price tag. Crispy on the outside, tender in the inside. Has many flavours to choose from. Marinated Duck Wings (4/5): Nicely seasoned and very aromatic. Many other marinated duck products: To try.Although some flavours may be unfamiliar to non-Chinese people, I believe this restaurant deserves a lot more exposure. The restaurant has a nearly invisible paper sign that says ""Chez Wuhan"" on the entrance and is decorated with cartoon duckling stickers on the windows. Yellow. Friendly. Ducklings. Add a few eggs and a bunny and it would be an Easter themed daycare. Wuhan is a city in central China. And one of their traditional delicacies is...? MARINATED DUCK NECKS. Hmm ducklings on the windows, marinated ducks, ducklings on the windows, marinated duuu... ok. I just connected the dots.So next time you pass by Lionel-Groulx, come on in with the kids and check out some authentic Wuhan duck products (as well as the best hot and sour glass noodles)."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If Chinese kitsch was a thing, this place would be a great example.Chez Wuhan is a tiny tiny little joint with just a few seats, a counter, and funny duckies decorating the rather cheap interior.Speaking of ducks, Chez Wuhan offers a great selection of marinated meats, including duck necks, duck tongues, duck wings, duck feet, pig feet, etc. Not only that, they also offer, to my great joy, a quite decent sour and spicy vermicelli (酸辣粉)! This place is obviously not catering mainstream Chinese food, and it probably took a toll on their popularity. In fact, googling the name will likely direct you to an unrelated Paris restaurant. They do have a Facebook page (2 likes!!) with the menu and a few pictures. That being said, nostalgic expats and sinophiles will likely find solace in Chez Wuhan's comfort food.Don't judge a book by its cover!"
