I truly believe that people should drive to go there just to have a cozy seafood restaurant experience. The decor was nice, it wasn't meant to be a fancy place but more of an adventure style. They had décors of lobster cages hanging, some boats made out of wood & a ""fake indoor terrasse"" ( not sure how to call it but you would see once you visit the restaurant).The prices are fair. I came with my parents for the Sunday promotion which is 2 for 25$ fish and chips. They had quite a selection. The flavours were: beer battered, Cajun, Jamaican jerk, lemon and fennel, curry, classic and much more. The menu has a little bit of everything: salads, tartares, burgers, seafood platters....My mom and I ordered the fish and chips. She had the lemon and fennel, I had the Cajun flavour. My dad ordered the mussels (creamy leek). The taste of the fish and chip was amazing. The texture of the fish was excellent. They served big pieces and were lightly battered (not the typical type where some places add a thick batter and you end up with a small piece of fish). The fish wasn't oily and was very crispy. This place used great quality fish for their fish and chips dish. As for the mussels, my dad loved the flavour. It was delicious and came inside a big pot.Overall, my experience was great. I feel in love with the food and can't wait to go back!"

We went on a Wednesday as it was taco night. It's advertised as $6 for tacos with a photo of 3 tacos... However, it's actually 1 taco for $6 or 3 tacos for $16, so beware. It was still worth it, because each tacos were unique, flavourful and filling. As an appetizer, we shared the lobster ravioli which obviously the portion is small, but it was my favourite dish there as the sauce is incredible. As main courses, we also tried the London fish and chips which was perfectly fried (and I love that there's a variety to choose from in the menu) and the mussels with marinara sauce which was disappointing due to the lack of sauce. Although the price can seem steep, it is a seafood restaurant and the portions are quite large so I thought it was reasonable. As it's a tiny restaurant, I wouldn't recommend going if you're a group of more than 4 people and I would reserve ahead. The reason why I have to remove a star is because the service was extremely long as we constantly waited for our food and for the waiter to come to our table. At the beginning of the night it was a full house so we were more understanding, but we felt forgotten at times and ended up staying there for almost 2 hours! I would still recommend eating here and hopefully the service will be more efficient."

As our entree we had the fish and chips, original style and Cajun style. Our meal was outstanding, the service was wonderful and we enjoyed our overall dining experience. We will be back for sure!!"

Service was polite but extremely slow.The full portion of fish and chips was very tasty. The clam chowder was good too. The seafood platter was a bit on the expensive side, not great value but delicious. Would have liked to have bread on the table since the meals took a while to arrive."
/user_details?userid=_5e8UDi5s5I9AS9DVB5JgQ,Fitzy B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I second Sheryl L. nice quaint little place but average food and above average price. (soup and a main for 2 with pitcher of beer didn't leave much change from $170) Service / Waiter a bit abrupt but seemingly less so to what we took to be regulars. Will return to give it another chance and try the fish n chips.

Finally went for supper with the in-laws (one of them had eaten there before). Turns out the menu was re-evaluated and things got more expensive portions for a little smaller. The food was average, presentation was A+. In my opinion a little expensive for the taste. But should try it at least once."
/user_details?userid=Sjp16LU3gMh--G6tQXqn4w,Valerie V.,"Sainte-Catherine, Canada",4 star rating,"The fish is really fresh, I've tried lots of fish and chips places and this place remains on top on my list. I love the ambiance and the decor. The terrasse is really cute. The price is also fair. Definitely worth the detour if you're not from the area. The only thing I would improve is increase the parking space."
/user_details?userid=jtN1UZuoLa4_fK02H5OfSg,Samuel Q.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for casual seafood dining. Especially nice during the summer as they open up the dining area and it becomes a terrasse. Good is well prepared, fresh and pretty straightforward. One page menu with the usual fish&chips, mussels, lobster rolls, surf and turf. They have fish&chips nights, all you can eat mussels nights, etc. Make sure to make a reservation!"

I tired the jamaican jerk ones, my wife had the panko ones. Both very good! I loved that the fish was crispy, but not too oily. Definitely need to go to actually eat there, and try something else!"
/user_details?userid=STGdWAW7jxJp3I7zvnQouQ,Stan M.,"Kahnawake, Canada",5 star rating,"Everything that I ate was excellent!Clam chowder was not thick but very rich in flavour without a fishy taste. Steamed clams are the best I ever ate! Small clams but the flavour was great!Lobster rolls were awesome at $8 each.  Two for $22 fish and chips on Sunday and Mondays is very, very good. 8 ways to order it and just as many dipping sauces. Best little seafood restaurant on the south shore and definitely worth coming too. Family friendly and wonderful service."
/user_details?userid=8ymaT3R_ixJ1ZIVeVh_6Mg,David B.,"Shelton, CT",5 star rating,"What great little restaurant in a industrial area. We were camping nearby and did not want to go far. They did not disappoint. Although they are famous for the fish and chips I had the burger with onions straws and grilled shimp. Great combo. And the chipotle mayo had just the right heat. My wife had the pasta with seafood (mussels,shrimp etc). She loved it. Good selection of Beers on tap (6). It seemed like a lot of locals were there which is always a good sign.Writing this review is making me hungry.I think i'm going to go there for lunch."
/user_details?userid=RADmqlq23F8l9azR_Dooqg,Jared L.,"Sainte-Catherine, Canada",5 star rating,What can I say but wow! Comfy seafood shack atmosphere reminds me of Newfoundland cozy lobster shacks. I had their infamous London fish and chips and was not disappointed. Just make sure you make your reservations at least 2 weeks in advance as they are very busy.
/user_details?userid=Y_q97PNavv00ZoUbQf0Jow,Patrick D.,"Greenfield Park, Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,"This was our first time there. The food was excellent, so was the service. Very casual decor and ambiance. Will definitely return. The Fish & Chips were perfect. They even serve mushy peas just like the Brits do. Whoever owns and operates this eatery knows his fish and seafood. Can't wait to try their tartares. The tuna tataki was superb. Fries to my liking and they offer malt vinegar. Quite the pkace for seafood."

We go back over and over not only because of the delicious food, but also the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. The ""Fricassé de palourdes"" is a must have, as well as the lobster imperial roll. If they have the general tao shrimp -not on the menu but sometimes available on tapas night- definitely try them!"

Once it arrived everything was delicious. It seemed as though if you knew the owners service was faster. Definitely will be going back but only because the food was so good."
/user_details?userid=GZOOwF5BJFSIJZUC9zWo4w,Jj T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place and great atmosphere. Restaurant parking space is limited, but there are many available nearby. Food is good too, but the price may be a bit higher than average."
