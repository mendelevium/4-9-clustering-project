They even offered us 2 extra pieces for free.They also sell other Iberian products from the Andalusia, Catalonia and other regions of Spain."

Fried chicken, fried pork chops, fried veal cutlets, fried fish, fried shrimp, fried vegetables and... and fried croquettes!Originally created by the founder of classical French cuisine, Philias Gilbert, and named after the verb to ""Croquer"" in French meaning to crunch or eat, these small balls or rolls of savory are fried in oil until crisp and golden -- insanely popular as both a delicacy and as a fast food!Since then, many variations emerged around the world. Haitians love it with cod. Jamaicans with plantains and rum. Latin Americans with yucca. Brazilians with chicken. Indians with chickpeas. In Spain though rather than being filled with potatoes, Spanish croquetas are filled with a creamy béchamel sauce and can include a variety of fillings like spanish ham, chicken, mushrooms, spinach, cheese or salt cod... typically any leftover food. The béchamel mixture actually has to be refrigerated overnight in order for it to be firm enough to be able to shape it into little thumb like shape to make the croquettes.Last weekend, after years of searching the local food scene high and low, I was thrilled to finally uncover a place that actually makes authentic Spanish croquettes!These heavenly crispy fried morsels simply melt in your mouth.Here's what I tried:Jamon: Spanish Serrano HamRabo: Oxtail braised to perfection Squid ink: Calamari, squid inkSeafood: Shrimp and garlicVegetarian: Roasted bell peppers and more Azteca: Roasted Corn & Poblano peppersLece Merengada: Cold Ice cream core... and a plate of this week's paella which are only served on Sundays. On Saturdays they serve a special cassoulet. And to wash all of this down, a pitcher of Hibiscus lemonade! The space is small, where half of the restaurant is reserved to a huge freezer and only seats 7 people but you'll probably gobble up these croquettes before you can say it - so no need to sit down. If you are around Mont Royal mountain, stop by to meet Tigreton and his wife Ana. These folks only cook that they trust, take the time to properly source their chicken, pork and all of their produce."

Foreigners beware: it's effectively cash only. They don't take credit or debit cards that can pass as credit as of February 2020. We had a tasting menu of veggie and meat based ones. All amazing. The chistorra one is a must-have for meat lovers and the Azteca for veggies. Make sure to have a chat with the owner, he is lovely."
