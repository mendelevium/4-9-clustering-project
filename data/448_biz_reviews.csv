/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We're moving into the same neighbourhood, so we decided to check out the new restaurant on the block. We've heard about this place from our new landlord, so we were excited to try the food.We got two vermicelli bowls, one with grilled chicken and the other with tofu and shittake mushrooms, one tofu spring roll, and one Vietnamese iced coffee. All dishes were solid, and beautifully presented. Everything in the dish was flavourful and they complimented each other with the different textures. The one thing that bothered me was that in my tofu and shittake bowl, I barely had any of the mushrooms and wished that there were more of them.I'm guilty of this, but you can't really compare this to the ""authentic"" Vietnamese places in Chinatown or elsewhere. Le Petit Sao may not be the typical Vietnamese restaurant you're used to, but they got creative and delivered just as much flavour as any other Vietnamese establishment. Can't wait to try their pho next!"

I ordered the fried cauliflower generesl tso's.  It might have been edible , we're it not for the disgusting, browning bean sprouts.  Gag."

My choice stopped on the bun bowl, it was okay, but there wasn't enough nuoc mam for me, and too much bean sprouts. The chicken was very good !  But that's just personal taste. My friends who took Pho were totally happy with it though. And the Banh Mi another one took was actually way smaller than we thought."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This restaurant needs to get their SERVICE ACT together. I popped in and ordered a small mango and papaya salad to go around lunch time. My order was paid for at 12:05pm.There's a bit of a line up but nothing crazy. As more people come in, I start noticing that the to-go lineup is growing while eat-in folks that ordered well after me are getting served.At 12:25pm, I ask when my salad will be ready... and... they haven't started making it yet. I turn around and see a few other takeout order folks getting worried about their order status as well. I got my food at about 12:33pm.Does the resto understand that many to-go orders come from folks who are particularly busy? People who order to-go so they can get back to their workstations ASAP? Why prioritize the eat-in folks? Hmm... maybe because they expect a tip that's conditional on service quality. The irony: I had PRE tipped the resto on my takeout order. Go figure.It's too bad. The food here is ok (not great, but ok), the place is clean, and it's conveniently located for me when I work from home.Full disclosure: the resto did comp me a fresh spring roll (I hadn't asked for anything to be comped). The gesture is was unanticipated and was appreciated (even though I don't eat fresh spring rolls) - hence the 2 star review rather than a 1 star review."
/user_details?userid=_hsruQCw6UTnjlQiuSpScg,Mike M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,Been to the other location a few times and it was amazing; I'm happy to say that this location is no different.  My go-to order is the banh mi with a side of pho broth.  Their banh mi is a modern interpretation of the traditional sandwich while still keeping the main features of a banh mi that everybody knows and loves.  I've eaten hundreds of banh mi's in my life and theirs definitely ranks amongst the best.  This place also has a nice homey atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.  Highly recommended!
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Second time visiting this nice Vietnamese restaurant as it's close to my office. I tried both the banh mi (a bit small) and the bun cha and they were quite tasty. Reasonably priced as well.
/user_details?userid=UHfafipFY8wy65iTYPiWQQ,Siwen J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,My friends and I ordered appetizers and 5 main plates. We waited for 20 min for appetizers and an additional hour for mains. I went to check and they hadnt started to make our food yet. The supervisor and the cook were arguing in the kitchen... We decided to leave finally after 1:30 without eating mains and disappointed.
