I lived in Poland for a month and ate nothing but the local cuisine the entire time so I know good authentic Polish food when I have it. The Pierogies were great and their Potato Pancakes were top tier. They even had authentic Żywiec imported from Poland, not the crap that's brewed in the US and has the label stuck on it. Eating here was like being back in Poland. If you're on vacation in Montreal and love authentic Polish cuisine, you gotta try this place."

This place reminds me of my grandma's eastern european cooking and I was glad to have found it a while back. The family have been coming here numerous times over the years and it never disappoints It's a great authentic Polish place that serves up fresh and delicious dishes. This place is rare and one of a kind. There's not many fine dining polish cuisines in Montreal so to have one on such a high end caliber is quite marvellous.As we walked in, the ambiance was genuine and inviting. There was a cheerful gentleman playing the piano and It complimented the the place on it's authenticity. Service: 5++++The lady greeted us to the resto and seated us at a fabulous table were we were able to enjoy the piano tunes and sip on some water while we were still thinking of what we wanted to order.The family recently came here for lunch on a cold day and we all agreed we wanted to warm up our bodies with some traditional borscht soup.I immediately ordered my favourite dish from childhood of the grandma's cooking (Flacki) :5/5 instead of the traditional borscht.this is a soup made with Tripe ahh myyyy gawdd it was so tender and delicious a real délicates. It was fresh and flavourful just pure joy.The folks got Borscht which came with sour cream if you like that ahaha the parents are creatures of habit and always go for that sour cream anything Potato Pancakes (Placki) were shared with sour cream again aha it was insanely fresh.I don't believe you can go wrong by ordering anything on their menu. Everything, is made on the spot and quite frankly the quality has always been consistent over the years.Overall, this is a great little gem and if you want to taste delicious authentic polish food you definitely must come here and try it out ! I definitely recommend this place."

We had a group of about 8 and were able to get a reservation.  I wanted everything on the menu.  Fortunately, one of my friends also did so we ordered a bunch of stuff and shared.  Everything was delicious.  The thing I was the most surprised about was the beef pirogies.  I'd never had them before and they were to die for!  I also liked that you could split up the pirogies so we had half beef and have cheese and potato."

It was one of the only few open during the time of a late lunch.To my suprise, this restaurant turned out AMAZING. This restaurant has traditional Polish food, which came to be the besT polish restaurant I have ever been to.I highly reccomend getting an order of perogies. They were so delcious and perfectly seasoned. My favorite were the ones filled with meat. The dumpling itself was chewy and bouncyI also recommend an order of their potato pancakes. They are fried to perfection!!I also recommend the fried beef/pork patty with a gravy and steamed potatoes. I have no idea what the potatoes had but they were extremely addictive.I ordered two different meals. One meal was a 3 course meal, where they had a soup, entree, and dessert with coffee. The barley soup I had was delicious, the entree was a variety of diffferent menu items (kind of like a platter), and the dessert was an apple pie with a sweet cream that I still dream of. The other entree was the fried patty and potatoes.Overall, so happy that fate brought me here to eat."

Stash Cafe is my friend's favorite restaurant.  We were visiting and staying over for the weekend and it was a surprise that they were going to take us to his favorite place and I have to say my wife and I were very happy to be both visiting and to be their guests.  The interior of Stash is very different.  The seating were in fact church pews and there was a large dresser type piece of furniture at the back and we were so curious we asked.  Apparently it was also from a church.A different twist is the night we came they had live music with a pianist playing all sorts of tunes from classical to rock to you name it.  The piano by the way is right by the main entrance.  The menu has a lot of choices and for Polish cuisine I have to say we know our stuff.  We have many Polish friends so we've had the distinct pleasure of trying many homemade dishes on many occasions.So besides having what came with our dinners my friend had also ordered us some placki and pierogi for appetizers before our mains which also happened to include both of these as well.  There's no such thing as too much apparently.  We all ordered what I think was called the debutante plate.  It started off with the warm borscht which I normally prefer over the cold version.  Sour cream seemed to be coming in waves with each plate which were the dressing for the soup, the pierogi and the placki starters.  The starter pierogi were beef and the placki were nice and crispy on the outside.  I loved the richness of the sour cream together with both and the borscht let's just say I was tempted to be licking the bowl like a dog!  To think if the starters were this good what would the plate be like?Well the main dish came and it's a mix of bigos, placki, stuffed crepe, and more pierogi.  As far as the flavors and everything I have to say this was the best Polish meal I've had.  That's saying a lot considering how much Polish food I've had in my day.  The pierogies on my plate this time were the mushroom and cabbage combo.  I want to mention that the service was above great.  Our server was on top of everything and very attentive and extremely polite and professional.While it's not often we come to Montreal I always find or have the opportunity to eat very well with each visit.  This visit was no different.  My friend's favorite place in his home town is exceptional.  With all the great places to eat in Montreal Stash is but just one in a sea of amazing places to dine.Sto lat!"
/user_details?userid=4rCxhWOWHF05dwhYIL9SYw,El D.,"Albuquerque, NM",5 star rating,"You can sit down and order ANYTHING here, you will not go wrong. We tried a variety of items and they all exceeded our expectations. First, when in a Polish restaurant you must have the Kielbasa w/ sauerkraut and potato pancakes (those pancakes complemented the dish very well, you can't go w/o them). A delicacy item was the Sledz, every bite of the pickled herring w/ the apples, sour cream, and onions took me to another world. The red wine probably had an influence in this journey as well. What else, yes the Pierogi we went with a variety of stuffings ranging from cheese/potatoes, cabbage/mushrooms(my fave out of the 3), and beef. Let's not forget dessert: Nalesniki, I'm talking crepes w/ cream cheese and raspberry (framboises - French spelling and sound makes this more justice). Next time I'm in Montréal I will ensure I return to this amazing place."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Had a surprise evening out at stash cafe and loved every second of it.Besides going to Poland I didn't think there would be such authentic cuisine but there was and it's right in the heart of old Montreal.As soon as you walk in you'll fall in love with the charming look of the stone walls and red light fixtures that hang over the tables.We had a fantastic time and it was so romantic with a nice view of the street. The perogies were incredible maybe even better than Poland.The pickles were the best pickles I've ever had AND they serve you ice cold vodka with ice cold shooters. Makes all the difference I swear.Beautiful charming place and I can't wait to go back.
/user_details?userid=hez4PSZ6dKGfrIautZWrbw,Daniel G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A popular Polish spot right in quaint Vieux Montreal. Old stone walls and wooden tables almost gives the place a medieval vibe. Authentic Polish eats complemented with quick yet stern service.To start, had the pierogies with roasted onion and very rich sour cream. The pierogie goodness went well with another app., the sledz or pickled herring, wrapped around a creamy potato centre. The strogonow is absolutely fantastic with very tender beef strips and a succulent black peppery sauce. The shredded beets on the side were done right with a nice garlic kick. On the cocktail menu the apple pie cocktail is a must-try if you're looking for something sweet. The combination of potato vodka, apple, lime and cinnamon goes really well. For dessert, the Nalesniki sweet cheese crepes garnished with fruit really top it off.Quality Polish eats with simple, sometimes a little stern service, in a cozy atmosphere."

With all the great spots in Montreal, I was a bit upset that I wasted a meal here.Came in for brunch - service was slow, lack-lustre, and employees just didn't seem to want to be there. My boyfriend got the potato latkes with eggs and spinach. No seasoning at all and super bland. I got the blood sausage with eggs and the same complaints. If you're in Old Montreal, check out all the other joints around the area if you're looking for a brunch spot. Maybe their regular menu is better, but unfortunately, I don't think I'd want to try considering all the other spots to choose from."

Kielbasa appetizer - delicious I also enjoyed my Polish mimosa - the apple and plum juice with spices was tasty and ""Christmas-y.""The service was great!  They were friendly and accommodating of our baby, and found us a spot to park our stroller next to our table with baby within it.  The food came out quickly.The stone walls and wooden tables created a cozy atmosphere, and we loved the posters hanging from the ceilings.  The bathrooms upstairs unfortunately did not have a changing table for our baby, which was a disappointment.Overall, this was a wonderful spot for a meal near Old Montreal!"

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, I felt like I was in another world.We had a reservation, which I would recommend because the place was quite busy. The dimly lit room was perfect for an intimate meal, especially with the live piano playing. The hanging lamps, the wooden furniture, the stone brick walls--it was just a beautiful atmosphere.Our waitress was very nice. Service was quick but not rushed. Everything on the large menu was very affordable for the amount and quality of food you're getting. I had the krokiety and it was magical. Crispy breaded crepe on the outside, tender beef within. I asked for tomato sauce instead of mushroom, which was gladly accommodated. The potato salad and normal salad on the side were very light and refreshing. The salad dressing was delicious.The portion sizes were huge, so we regrettably did not have room for dessert. We walked out comfortably full and satisfied. I wish I had food like this back home."

Well worry not, since this one's definitely worth a visit.I, too, was planning to go somewhere more French, but I ended up here for dinner and definitely don't regret it. The ambiance inside is classy and comfortable: prints hanging on the walls, a pianist playing in the corner, and red lighting giving the whole restaurant an eerie glow. It feels like stepping out of Montréal and into a different country.For food, I got the ""Menu du Débutant"" Table d'Hôte. The starter was a piping hot borscht. The main course was a hearty collection of different appetizers (pierogi, a potato pancake, a croquette, and bigots). And for dessert, I got an apple cobbler with cream (good but unremarkable).Overall it was a tasty meal and a fun experience. Pay Stash a visit if you want something unique and different for your next meal."

We were sat right away and it was a fun busy atmosphere. The piano player is great and was good background music. We ordered two appetizers to split- the potato pancakes, kielbasa, and our server suggested we get the main course pierogis instead of two appetizers to save a couple bucks. She even offered to do a split of two flavors- my husband loved the beef and I loved the cheesy potato ones.  Our only complaint is service was good, but not the best. Our server did not hear that we wanted the potato pancakes and did not check back with us until we were done eating our other two dishes. I would have preferred to have them all together. Had she checked in just once earlier, we could have re-ordered them sooner. We actually had to grab another server to order them so that was annoying. Other than that, fantastic polish food!"

They have an interesting selection for drinks.  You must order food in order to be served drinks - apparently for legal reasons!  We even tried the vodka in pickled juice just for kicks and it turned out to be pretty good.The food here is amazing.  Whether it be the polish sausage, veal, pirogies, the polish dinner or desserts.  The potato pancakes are undoubtedly the best you can ever taste.The ambiance of the restaurant is very casual and the live pianist in the evening makes it even better.  Parking can be tricky around here.Pricing : Not an inexpensive place but you get the value for your money.Will I return? : Definitely!"
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",4 star rating,"Duck into this red-hue, low lit Vieux-Montreal restaurant for an epicurean experience of pure Polish comfort foods. The potato pancakes were just like my mother made and the pirogies are must-haves, the sauerkraut rich, and our main entrees satisfying, full of depth and flavor. You can taste the love cooked into these honest and hearty dishes. This is old-school dining at its best, a restaurant doing its thing without feeling compelled to be hip, fusion, trendy, or modern. And it works! Our waiter was pleasant, but did not ask to refill our wine. We could have easily been swayed into another carafe. Dessert menu was very limited, but we were pleasantly full from dinner to do more than glance at the selections. Verdict: Authentic restaurant in the heart of Vieux-Montreal is perfect on a cold night. A hearty mix of locals along with visitors is a good sign that the Stash Cafe is a smart pick in a city overflowing with dining options."

We walked into a dimly red lit, cozy restaurant with a smell that made my mouth water. Despite not having reservations, we were seated immediately at a nice table by the front windows.We started off with some Kielbasa for an appetizer - probably one of my favorite types of sausage, and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly sautéed with tasty onions. For the main, we both settled on the Strogonow - strips of perfectly cooked beef filet in a red wine sauce with mushrooms, plus a bonus two small potato pancakes and a beet salad. The beef was flavorful and satisfying, and the potato pancakes were among the best I've ever had. Stash Café for a great Polish meal? You can't beat it."

But since it's usually just a summertime thang, get your borscht while it's hot, as in when it's served cold. And why not follow that up with a delicious brunch plate. Decisions are tough at Stash because everything on the regular and brunch menus sounds delicious, everything that passes by you looks enticing. Just go with the flow and get that breakfast Zyviec beer to whet your appetite and to wash it down. I had the sunny side ups wit potato pancakes and sausage - the only thing missing, in my view, was a bit of sour cream for the pancakes (the yolk goes far, but who doesn't want smetana as well).  Incredible service here as well, attentive, friendly and very pro."
/user_details?userid=vNToltF1f4NLPRNHH4DEbg,Sam G.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Walking around Old Port with my family, we decided to stop here for dinner. Everything was shared family style so I got to try some of everything.Food 5/5: Keeping in mind that this was my first time eating Polish food, everything was delicious! We got the ""set"" Debutant menu which came with the soup of the day and dessert. The soup of the day was pickle soup which although sounds weird, was one of my favourite things, completely unique! The dessert was an apple crumble, which was the perfect ending to the meal, not too sweet and with fresh whipped cream. The Debutant main was a mix of their top sellers, which I definitely recommend getting this so you can try different stuff. The placki were like giant hash browns and the pierogis were probably the best I've ever had. We also ordered strogonow and golabki. I loved the beet salad side! We wanted to try the sznycel but they were sold out. Everything was tasty however very heavy and meaty, I was glad we didn't get an extra dish. Atmosphere 5/5: The restaurant is quaint, with comfortable bench seating for big groups but dark romantic lighting for dates. It's a versatile space even though the restaurant is quite small. It's quite busy though so I would definitely recommend making reservations.Service 3/5: This is where they lost points. We'd been eating all day so we didn't order a lot for dinner, and most of my family doesn't drink, so I felt like we were a write-off to the waitress. Once she took our orders, I don't think we saw her again until she brought the bill. She didn't come by to check on us or refill water."

Food was slow so that may have been because it was busy.  Morale of the story is everyone out of our table got their food with the exception of me. My take is they didn't enter my order. People were done their meal before I got my food. Such poor service unfortunately. All I got was a sorry sir it will be 2-3 more minutes meanwhile the rest of the table is finishing their meal.  Ridiculous!!No discount, no free dessert or make it up.

/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,Robert G.,"Clackamas County, OR",5 star rating,"I didn't know how I'd like this place.  The name confused me.  Stash Cafe' doesn't sound very Polish.  In fact, it's the name of a brand of tea in the U.S.  I had read a little bit about Stash Cafe' and the write-ups (in guides, not on reviews) were very good.  Those are more reliable than crowd sourced reviews because they are written by people whose writing is both excellent and has je ne sais quoi (ideal for write-ups about Montreal).  I approached the menu on display at its exterior with some caution, looked it over, tried to identify some items I'd like and had a good price-quality-quantity rapport, and walked away to think about it.  I returned.  I'm glad I did.Stash Cafe' is often full.  Upon going in, I saw some two tops in front of me, with the bigger tables at the perimeter.  The person greeting me asked me where I wanted to sit of the limited spots available and I pointed at the two tops, but specified the ones in the back and away from the entrance.  That turned out to be serendipitous, as I will explain.I had a combination type platter and there were some pierogi(es) in the equation.  The server helped me dissect what was on the menu, being both a pleasant and patient individual.  The flavors were robust, hearty, and downright delicious.  I had either a soft drink, coffee, or hot tea as a beverage.Stash is a little more than what a Polish diner would charge if it were in more vanilla parts of this city, but it's in the Old Town, or Vieux-Montreal.  However, it was worth it.  The interior is a little dark but that could have been that dusk had arrived and that there was a piano player adding to the ambiance and doing a great job.  Again, the service I received was just great.Upon sitting down, a conversation with the folks at an adjacent table spontaneously ensued.  They were remarking about how good their food was and looking my way.  It turned out that the people seated next to me were a European couple whose home had been Montreal for a long time.  With this unexpected and serendipitous turn, it kept me from taking photos, slowed down the pace at which I normally eat, and caused me to forget some of the details of what I ordered.   Stash Cafe' turned out to be a wonderful experience.  From me, they get a ""thumbs up"" on all dimensions.  Thus, it seems fitting that it is situated in the historic center of Montreal so both locals and tourists are able to enjoy what it offers."

The cabbage stew is well seasoned, but a bit too salty for me. The mushrooms in cabbage stew are good but only few pieces. There are many sausages and pork in the stew. The portion is pretty big.

The meat was flavorful and the mushroom sauce served with the dish was divine, ask for extra mushroom sauce!The only thing that let the place down was the service. We waited a long time for a table as the waiters would not seat us since the hostess was on a telephone call and the food took quite a while to come out. This is forgiven as the food was excellent."

We were DYING for some perogies and we got there after their kitchen closed. Instead of just turning us away, they recommended another bar nearby that served food and we enjoyed thoroughly. The next day, we got to Stash right before closing the kitchen. They definitely have a great team staffed and they brought our food out quickly and kindly. They also have live piano in the evenings which was a beautiful touch! I honestly felt like royalty because their servers were so kind, considerate, and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place."

It's just warm, and inviting and large windows that has a nostalgic view of Montreal streets. Lots of natural wood, and natural lighting from outside. Who wouldn't love it here. I've never had polish food before and this was one of those places that you would visit again. Decent portions for the price and all around great food to classic dishes. I had the Poranek Polki - 2 sunny side up eggs with potatoe pancakes. My friends had the Zapiekana. I would save the level of comfort food is equivalent to grilled cheese with tomato soup on a rainy day."

I asked for four meat ones and four potato and cheese ones rather than limiting myself to one only type.Oh, and their potato salad is very good.This place has a nice low-key feel to it and the old church pews give it a bit of old world ambience which is suiting for an Eastern European restaurant in Old Montreal.I don't have a lot of Polish restaurants to compare this one to but this place sure hits the spot."

Rue St-Paul is an awesome little street with numerous restaurants and shops.I have had Polish food  in Philadelphia but Stash is different. The Polish places I have I been to before were mostly in bars or semi cafeteria style but Stash is a really, really nice place. The space is very old world inside and warm with a wood and stone interior. We were there in June and the windows were open. They had a live piano player that only added to Stash's charm.Everything we had we really great, including the Pierogis. I had the Polish Stroganoff and that was pretty darn incredible.

/user_details?userid=HazZWd5jBiGhPfI4C9CJVg,Zach B.,"Rochester, NY",4 star rating,"I'll keep this brief: get the potato pancakes.I still can't get over how good they were. They were hands-down the best I've ever had in my short 26 years of life. I don't know how ""traditional"" they were, but if your Polish grandma makes potato pancakes that aren't like these, she makes them objectively worse.Seriously, these pancakes exist on a local maximum of the hyper-dimensional pancake tastiness function: there is no possible step you could take that could make these pancakes taste better. They were *magically* savory in a way I can't describe. They were delicious enough to eat by themselves, but still played well with the applesauce we ordered as a side.  Side note: I had never had a pancake so good that I was reluctant to mask its flavor with applesauce, but here we are.Everything else we ordered as solidly above-average Polish food. The pierogies were nice, and it was great we could sample all the different flavors with one order. I tricked my girlfriend into getting the black sausage, which was good as far as blood sausages go. It reminded me a little bit of haggis, but with less intense spices. I'd probably skip that unless you're ok with blander flavors. (I do like haggis, by the way.)The atmosphere reminded me a little bit of the Russian Tea Room in NYC, but more approachable.  Another pro-tip: if you're older or disabled, feel free to use the elevator up to the bathroom--the stairs are pretty steep and I saw an elderly lady having a little trouble climbing them!"

As we walked by the storefront, someone opened the door and we heard the piano playing and we were just drawn inside. We didn't have a reservation so we were thankful they were able to seat us at the bar. The place has an incredible vibe, between the jazz music, the dim lighting, the old features. We ordered the entree of pierogies and the potato pancakes. And, to be really honest, I'm not sure I've eaten anything better in my life. The pierogies are topped with these perfect little onions that add the perfect flavor. The potato pancakes are crispy and flavorful. We both cried as we realized we had gone through the food so fast and ended up cutting our last pierogies into the tiniest bites in hopes to savor it for a little while longer. I'll be dreaming about this place until I make my way back to Montreal. In fact, I'll probably plan a trip just so that I can eat those pierogies again."

I'd prefer a Chinese dumpling in this case, with meat you can actually taste in terms of texture.It was bland, it wasn't enough food...The borscht was not a real one, it was a light soup which everyone told me was not a true borscht because there was just a light beet soup.I'll try it again but so far, it's just okay.

/user_details?userid=5qIwy91T9rAQj3_2O4cn5g,Leo M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,Good Polish food in a charming atmosphere.I  dined here a few days ago and to get a feel for the place ordered the 'sampler plate' - the Table d'Hote's Menu du Debutante. For my appetizer I chose the the Sledz - a very tasty 'herring salad' wrapped in a herring filet. For the entree plate itself the Pierogies were the star of the car - plump and tasty and perfect. The Placki (potato pancakes) were delicious as well - though I would have liked a bit of apple sauce to go with the sour cream. On the other hand the Krokiet (croquette) was kind of bland for a fried crepe filled with meat. But most disappointing was the Bigos (cabbage stew with meat and mushrooms) which was oddly flavorless given the ingredients. The Menu du Dubutante comes with a small fruit cobbler but I instead ordered the Hazelnet cake - creamy and nutty and delicious. I paired all this with a St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout and coffee.If I were to do it again I think I would try the vegetarian version of the Menu du Debutante - getting the mushroom Krokiet and cheese/potato or cabbage/mushroom Pierogies. Or just stick with the Pierogies.As I mentioned the atmosphere is charming and there is a small bar off to one side of the restaurant. As for the service...it was brusque yet efficient and aggressively polite almost to point of rudeness. It took me back to any number of Eastern European restaurants I've visited in the past.

In the past they are not opened on Mondays, but we were both surprised they were open November 30!!! A Monday and Andrzejki (St. Andrew's Day)! The lovely lunch at 12:30 was peaceful, 3-4 tables of customers. Very quiet. The interior is absolutely gorgeous. You can impress anyone here!Stash makes good traditional Polish dishes such as - pierogi $13 we asked them for a mix. So we had some with meat stuffing, some with cheese and potato (l love this one), and the rest with mushrooms and cabbage, topped with caramelized sweet onions- krokiet $4.50 one crispy roll (like a fried dumpling) with mushrooms or meat. I had the mushrooms and it was great, I gobbled it up fast.- barszcz soup, which is beets soup, deep wine red in colour and supposedly spicy. Stash's is not spicy at all, but still flavourful and quite nice. It's best when hot so don't let it sit!The best Polish dishes are perhaps at your Polish friend's home, but Stash Cafe fills the void and with wonderful service. They have Polish beer and wine, as well as the incredibly delicious crepes with cheese, topped with sugar, sweet strawberries and fruits. You do in fact eat this as dinner in Poland, but here in Montreal this is a dessert. And it was sooooooo delicious. This is officially my favourite crepe of all time."

Not very large but they have seated large party's in the middle by putting tables together. When you are a party of two they just separate the table of four a little. Last year they actually had a chef grilling outside on the sidewalk. The kitchen is downstairs and service is efficient. Very small bar and I have eaten at the bar when no tables were available. The desserts are in a case next to the bar area, save room even if you normally don't eat dessert. I often take mine home because it's so good. Looking forward to my next visit."

We passed this restaurant as were searching for our meal and on a Saturday in old Montreal, good luck trying to get a table. We waited 20 minutes and it was well worth it. The schnitzel was not greasy and light. The potato pancakes are to die for..ligt and crispy. The goulash flank steak with mushroom sauce was delicious with the best red beet salad!   The atmosphere was great, decent prices and the service was excellent. Must try that is diffrent from the rest of the tourist trap."

My mother-in-law is an INCREDIBLE cook and so is her mother and they tell me her mother was a great cook and I totally believe them. I could eat my mother-in-law's pork chops everyday and I don't even like pork THAT much. Let me tell you Stash Café takes me back to my visits in Poland sitting in my grandmother-in-law's apartment. We would chat as I peeled potatoes (she spoke no English I spoke no Polish) and she would show me how to cook and I would watch and try to learn all I could. The Flaki here is perfect. I tried flaki at a restaurant in America and almost couldn't eat it ever again (it smelled weird). Thankfully I gave the Flaki here a try and it is delicious. If you like menudo you will like this Polish version. I'm not going to lie to you people, it's cow intestine. That may sound scary to some of you out there, but you're really missing out if you don't try this. The texture is unique the flavor is unique. It's a rich soup full of herbs and spices and tender meat. Don't think about it just try it. The kielbasa has that snap that I cannot live without. Who can bite into a sausage and enjoy it without the snap? You need the snap. Full flavored sausage here. The Sledzie (pickled herring with apples)! I've never had this outside of my mother-in-law's house let alone seen it on a menu! Also we only have it over the holidays so this was a real treat and Wow this was good. The plating is done tastefully. The juicy meaty herring the tart green apples the creamy smietana the bite from the onions the fresh fragrant Italian leaf parsley.  All there. Again don't think just do it. Try it.Lastly but not leastly the hunters stew Bigos. Phenomenal in my mother-in-laws house also phenomenal here. There's prunes and their delicious kielbasa and cabbage and sourkraut. There were juniper berries in there and bay leaves and the broth. So rich. This is a hearty meal. It's called hunter's stew for a reason. It was made to warm the hunters up after long days in the woods. This will warm you up and make you feel full and cozy inside. Wow. You can tell this has been cooking at least since yesterday. The flavors are fully developed in this hearty stew. You will go home satisfied and happy. I tried all the unique things my in-laws make best. I haven't seen most of these items on menus in different Polish restaurants around the world. (Even in Warsaw.) This is what the Polish people eat at home. This is real Polish food."

First things first, Stash serves Polish food, so there was of course a vodka list. JJ ordered a Belvedere, which was startlingly cheap (CA$7). I ordered myself an IPA, and we settled down to look at the menu.I ordered some cheese and potato pierogis for us to share, which were pillows of heaven and came with a side of sauerkraut that I was initially wary of, but gobbled down once I got a taste. I also had beef stroganoff, which was rich, hearty, and arrived with a side of potato pancakes and beet salad (shredded). I was perfectly satiated by the time I finished my food. Service was on point, especially once the vodka got flowing. We finished our delicious meal and headed reluctantly back out into the cold.As a final note, I thought I hated sauerkraut. Turns out I've just never eaten it when it's been made properly. If you're in the same boat, or if you really need some good pierogis, stop by Stash and you won't be disappointed."

This was the first meal we had, late night, after driving 7 hours from NY. It was cold and rainy outside but stepping into this restaurant, we instantly felt warm and cozy. The space is small and intimate and quite romantic with the red lampshades. We had two overtired and hungry kids in tow so too bad it wasn't as romantic for us...but they graciously sat us in the corner of the room where we could put our stroller near the table. We ordered conservatively at first but after clearing our plates in 5 minutes we had to order more. The food was so comforting and delicious, and I didn't even know I liked Polish food. We ordered: KROKIET, Breaded crepe roll filled with beef and mushroomsPIEROGIPLACKI: Potato pancakesKIELBASASTROGONOW: Beef StroganoffSZNYCEL WIEDENSKI: Breaded veal schnitzel served with sunny side up eggThe veal schnitzel was a bit bland so we asked for a side of the mushroom gravy to top it and it was perfect.

My mother has Eastern European ancestry, and she attests that this location is truly authentic to Polish cuisine. The spinach crepes and pierogi were the best dishes of the meal (flavorful and satisfying), while the sole fillet was just fine and the bread was okay.

It feels really cozy and warm, which was great since it was downpouring outside that evening. We were seated right away and our water was friendly and attentive. Everything is priced very well--we all got appetizers, wine, and a full meal for around $40 per person. The waiter also gave us our individual checks without us even having to ask, which was awesome.I got the cheese and potato Perogies as an appetizer and the Krokiety with beef as my main meal. The Krokiety came with a side salad and sauerkraut--the salad dressing was to die for, I wish I got the recipe for it from the waiter. Everything I ate was very flavorful and homey.

Well if it has great reviews, looks really inviting, and if it happens to be snowing and freezing outside (like it was when we went), then I think those are good enough reasons.Actually I had one of the more distinctive soups that I've ever had at this restaurant, hence the four stars. I've looked everywhere but I really haven't found a place here in the Bay Area that could duplicate the ""zurek"" soup (sour rye malt soup) I had here. Simply wonderful...Sure the sausages and pierogies were great as well, but on a cold winter's day that soup is what I remember most."

We were seated by a very welcoming waitress which kept a smile throughout our entire meal. Since it was my first time trying Polish food I went with the beginner's plate which offered me pierogi, placki, krokiet, and bigos. Genius isn't it? The plate was like a Christmas present to me because I was excited to try everything but I wasn't sure what to expect. Everything was delicious especially the pierogi (dumplings) and the krokiet which was a roll covered in breadcrumbs with a meat filling. I don't know which kind meat the krokiet's filling was (maybe beef) but it didn't matter because it quickly slid down into my belly! As for the pierogi, those were heavenly. The dough was al dente and the filling was rich. I want more of those miniature pillows!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Polish colleague of mine brought me to Stash Cafe  years ago and the restaurant was on my list to revisit since then. We were a group of nine and at first we started kind of slowly with the drinks and orders, as soon as our choice was made appetizers and mains started coming quickly, and orderly. The food in Stash was perfect for the rainy fall evening, filling, warming and quite delicious. I had the tripe soup, which was amazing, very well seasoned and the tripe was excellently cooked. The two starters we tried were the herring, single piece of fish garnished with apples and sour cream, and the  potato pancakes. The potato cakes were just Ok, but I'm a big fan of the herring. The main courses were perfectly prepared. If you opt for schnitzel you would not regret and it comes with wonderful red beet salad. The star of the dinner with no doubt were the pierogi, there are three flavours to choose from, the meat ones being my favourite. We naturally went with the Polish and Czech beers as a drink choice, but the menu offers good wine list and some vodkas if you'd like to consume your herring appropriately. The restaurant has cute atmoshphere, the little benches used for seating may be a little bit uncomfortable if you fit three grown up people in them. However, the good food compensates for it. The live piano performance is wonderful. I can easily see myself coming again for some soup and pierogi, and glass or more of wine."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Stash Café has hearty, satisfying, stick-to-your-ribs fare. It's simple in it's approach without trendy foams, dusts, or smoke emanating from a glass dome. This is the kind of food I wished my Eastern European grandmother would have made had she been a better cook. Last night I came in with a pretty big party of family and friends. My sister and I shared the Placki (potato pancake appetizer) and they were thick but not heavy. Then we each had a plate of Krokiety, which is essentially a deep fried rolled up crepe, either with a mushroom or beef filling, and a mushroom sauce on top. It was served with a simple green salad and a dilly potato salad. This is one of my favorite dishes, and although I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms generally, this dish is somehow comforting - I even prefer the ones filled with mushroom! We were stuffed at that point, but I forced myself to share a portion of plum cobbler which was perfect for early fall and absolutely delicious! So why not 5 stars? The ambiance is nice, but when you have a larger party seated along pews, you cannot really talk to anyone except those next to you or across from you. Also, we had a lovely waitress, but she seemed over-worked, handling several tables and carrying out multiple dishes without tray, leading to her doing several trips (even for smaller tables). When the whole table isn't served at the same time, then those who are served have to wait, or the ones without a meal watch their companions start without them. TLDR; simple, honest, Polish comfort food."

I'm sure glad we came here because we were treated to a lovely polish meal, something you definitely won't find in Colorado. There were only a couple of groups seated when we arrived so we had no trouble getting a table. Our servers were kind and very attentive. We ordered the pierogis (cabbage and mushroom), two house salads, and the stroganoff. Everything was so delicious!! The salads came out first and they were lightly coated in a delectable dressing that reminded me of a Caesar but definitely had something else in it. I finished every leaf of lettuce! Next the pierogi which I ordered as a meal but there were only four small ones on the plate. However, they were tasty! Soft, juicy and flavorful I could have eaten a lot more. I even enjoyed the side of sauerkraut and usually I hate the stuff so that was pretty cool. I got to try a bit of the stroganoff which was excellent; meaty with a hearty amount of mushrooms. However, the star of the plate in my opinion was the potato pancakes because they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. For some reason they also tasted like bacon?! I was definitely on board :)In the end food is delicious, prices are fair and staff is friendly. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"

While scrolling down the, what seemed like a million, restaurants in the area I spotted this place. Being Polish it caught my eye, we had never had Polish before so we thought we'd go try it out. We were seated right away. The restaurant is swanky in the all the right way, outfitted with leather booths and old fashion décor. Our server was prompt and friendly, knowledgeable about the menu lucky for us, we of course had lots of questions about the cuisine. I settled on the meat and cheese Perogies, my friends went with the Kielbasa and cabbage. Holy cow, the food was fantastic. The Perogies, were prepared to perfection. The Kielbasa was juicy and cabbage was surprisingly savory. Prices were moderate, I assume everything in the Old Port area is priced slightly higher than the rest of the city but in my opinion it was worth it. I would definitely visit again."

This place has a certain feel to it that I absolutely love, one that begins from the moment you enter the rustic wooden door. The ceiling feels like a rustic European beerhall with the plaster and wooden banisters, and I love the stone walls. The bathroom area is also above a beautiful stone spiral staircase. All of this just underscores the great ambiance.The food is fantastic European comfort/fried offerings. We started with the cheese and potato pierogis (yum!) and potato pancakes/latkes (solid, but nothing special). For our meal we got the Chicken Schnitzel (wife) and Veal Schnitzel (me). Each came with a small potato side that was far superior to the latkes. I loved my dish - rich and flavorful - but my wife out ordered me here. The chicken paired with the coleslaw was so moist and crunchy at the same time!Service was slow, but not rude or impolite (unlike some other experiences we had while in Montreal).Bottom line: if you like polish food and are looking for a gem of a place to dine with a great atmosphere, do not skip this place!"

I did not like the fact that Stroganoff came with potato pancakes, that's just too greasy, I would have preferred boiled potatoes instead.I ordered barszcz soup and it was just a simple beet broth. I was told this is traditional Polish barszcz. It was good but I prefer regular borscht that comes with beets and veggies inside. So I think that $5 for just a broth is too expensive.We also ordered Pierogis appetizer: 4 different Pierogis (meat, cheese and potatoes, and cabbage and mushrooms).

The food is fresh, well plated, well portioned but lacks proper seasoning.Pierogi are probably the best dish - tender, light. Stay away from the schnitzel - it's tasteless.Service is attentive. The place feels a bit like a cafeteria probably because of the cheap wooden tables and chairs. The restaurant is set In an old church and uses pews for some bench sitting. That's cute but not very practical unless you like to sit in the high school gym bleachers. I recommend it for lunch. It's fun and gives you a taste of the peasant food of the past. Good news is that you don't need to plow the field afterwards."

We were warmly greeted and shown to a great little table looking out onto the cobblestone street and it's occasional passing horse-drawn carriage. It was all very touristy, but in the best sense possible.Having heard that Polish food tended toward heaviness we carefully chose our lunch portion to match our appetite.  I had the tripe soup (Flaki)  and an entree level order of pierogies whereas the Missus had Barszcz and Kielbasa - their typical beet soup and sausage meal.The honeycomb tripe's texture was OMG wonderful, as was the hearty broth. The pierogies were completely unexpected. They were delicate little pouches, their translucent skins glistening and  hinting at the promise of meaty yummy goodness. A dollop of sour cream just sent the meal over the top. I almost started planning a trip to Poland solely on the strength of these nibbles it was that good.I think that the Missus's meal met her standards because she wouldn't share any of her dishes with me.

/user_details?userid=ZozeRlq1OuAl5uDg1cYIcA,David K.,"Ayer, MA",4 star rating,"It was quite by accident that we found ourselves at a second Polish restaurant in as many days during our recent visit to Montreal. We had made hasty reservations elsewhere but upon discovering that it had an ambience somewhere between a punk rock club and a frat party a quick change of plans was needed. It was Saturday night and Vieux Montreal was hopping; would we be stuck eating Poutine again? We spotted this place and it looked busy but it never hurts to try. Surprisingly and to our relief, she looked around and said just a few minutes and I can fit you in. Great!So we sat on a bench inside while we waited and took in the ambience. It was completely full, with tables of all sizes densely packed. But not in a claustrophobic way. The effect was almost like a jigsaw puzzle: the tables as interlocking pieces filling the cozy historic stone-walled dining room. Soon our table was ready and we were escorted, right into the heart of the animated scene.We looked at the menu and everything looked good, with all the standard Polish fare one would expect. But for some reason we were both attracted to the appetizers. There were six and we wanted them all. So we pointed to the appetizer page page and asked for ""one of everything"". Plus a salad.Now probably appetizers are not the best way to judge a restaurant, as they can sometimes be rather simple and not where the chef shows off his talents. But no matter. They were all very good and exactly what we hoped for. We had: Krokiet (breaded crepe roll stuffed with meat and mushrooms), Placki (potato pancakes), Pierogies (pastries stuffed with various savory fillings), Kielbasa sauteed with onions, Sledz (picked herring), and something else which escapes me. All simple plain food, just what we expected and hoped for. The only surprise to me was the sauerkraut: much milder than I am used to, with less salt and vinegary tang. I liked it though.I'd love to go back someday and try some of the entrees. Maybe next visit?For dessert we got a slice of hazelnut cake. Plenty big enough to share. Good enough though not memorable.Some Yelpers have mentioned problems with the service. I couldn't disagree more. Our server was efficient, friendly, and made us feel right at home from the moment we came inside.I almost forgot to mention the piano player. He sat at an ancient upright piano and played throughout the evening. Mostly old jazz and jazzy renditions of old pop tunes. I only wish we would have played some Chopin (who was Polish). Be sure to tip him; he helped to make the place feel special."

Then some fresh Rye bread with butter. For the main course we all ended up getting the mixed plate. It had Perogies, a Potato Pancake, a meat croquet, and the most delicious sauerkraut! It was rich and filling. The sauerkraut was cooked with beef and sausage providing a flavor that was out of this world!!! The meal ended with coffee and a fruit cobbler of choice. I had the peach with creme-fresh on top! The ambiance was comfortable and the service was wonderful. We felt welcome as guests of the restaurant and our server made sure that all of our needs were met. If I lived closer, I would become a regular."

It was -18 outside when we passed by, and it was closed. Because of my Polish heritage, however, I wrote down the name and vowed that before we left the city, we would eat there.I called from the hotel the next day, made a dinner reservation, and spent the day anxiously awaiting our trip to Stash Cafe. I grew up on Polish food. I don't have a grandmother on my mother's side. I have a Babci. She's been cooking polish food for me for 25 years. So, too, has my mother. The meal that I had at Stash Cafe that night with my wife stands up next to the cooking of my mother and my Babci as being some of the best Polish dishes I've ever eaten. I had the kielbasa. They were divine. Cooked absolutely PERFECTLY, with a side of potatoes that were out of this world. My wife had the pierogis, stuffed with cheese and potatoes. As good as the kielbasa was (and believe me, it was fantastic), I found myself envious of (and eating most of) her dinner. The next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be going back. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is fantastic (they have a piano player that comes in and dazzles), and the location is fantastic.Oh, and don't forget to order dessert. (P.S. For those who said the service can be slow, take a step back to enjoy life. Not everything has to be fast/fast/fast go/go/go all the time)."

The first time at the Stash we ordered Pirogi and another dish. Then the Pirogi arrived it had a wrong filling and instead of the 8 pieces as started on the menu there was only 7 pieces on the plate. The mistake was corrected with a new plate from the kitchen. Second time at the Stash ordered Pirogi and another dish. Again received Pirogi with wrong filling. Had to wait for correct order to arrive from the kitchen. The third time ordered Duck and another dish. After 1 hour and 20 minutes nothing arrived. Inquired with the waiter three times about the food and each time were told that it is almost ready. Customers at three tables around all arrived after we were seated and all had their appetizers and main dishes served and finished while we were still waiting for our food. Our waiter was unpleasant and unfriendly. After 1 hour and 20 minutes we got up and left hungry and angry. Extremely disappointing! I don't know if they forgot to put the order in or did not have a duck to serve, but there should of been a way to avoid this. Give a customer an appetizer or something... Be honest... Be friendly... You can't make people wait for food for an hour and 20 minutes... If the duck is not ready to be served serve the other items that were ordered. Offer something on the house... Do something!I am greatly disappointed in Stash. The food that we tried was good, but overall I can't recommend it.

For dinner we ordered bigos (roasted meat, sausage, and lots of cabbage), krokiety (breaded meat and mushroom crepes with a side of salad and side of potato salad), and golabki (cabbage rolls stuffed with pork and rice with side of pickled red cabbage). Bigos was well made and tasty but did not look so appetizing. Krokiety had two separate crepes, one was meat and other was mushroom. The salad and potato salad were not so different from the American versions.

The waiter was very attentive and the service was pleasant. I ordered this dish (which I will not name here but describe because I don't want to butcher the language) that was basically breaded fairly large nuggets that were made of ground pork with mushroom sauce/beet salad/potatoes. It was seriously satisfying and I really enjoyed it. Beet salad was quite delicious too! Not too sour/sweet.  My bf had the pierogies (sp? correct my spelling if it's wrong) but they are essentially Polish dumplings with mushroom, cheese, and potatoes. Those were enjoyable too. Portion sizes were just right and not overwhelming. The dinner was definitely different than what I usually am used to but I really recommend coming here because they have live piano playing, I'm assuming around dinner time.

Wow, what a find! This place serves hearty Polish/East European cuisine in a low-lit intimate setting. And, did I mention at dirt cheap prices? No joke!The staff here are very friendly, however note: The service is European-style. Do NOT expect prompt, speedy service with multiple check backs and all that. One person (when they're ready) will take your order, someone else brings your food, and then you pretty much linger..and linger, and so forth...But, its all good, if you go in expecting this type of laid back hospitality (similar to most restaurants in Montreal). We were encouraged to order some vodka to go with our meals...Yes!!! But, we were quite thirsty and each opted to have a nice 20oz pour of Montreal's foremost microbrew: Saint- Amboise for $7.00C. Great choice as it pairs well with this type of hearty cuisine.For our meals we ordered a few different popular choices and turned our table into a Smorgasbord. Our choices: Pierogi, filled with meat and cheese, served with fresh sour cream $15.25C (best pierogi I've ever had, whaat??), Golabaki, meat stuffed cabbage served with potatoes and vegetables $12.75C (again, phenomenal), and Placki, potato pancakes served with fresh sour cream and sweet chunky homemade applesauce $11.25C (to die for!).Needless to say, I will definitely be making this a routine spot to hit when ever I'm in the great city of Montreal. Between the quality of the food and gorgeous décor, ambiance and artwork which lines Stash's walls, one would expect to pay so much more.

Good friends of our are Polish & have cooked for us as well. Additionally, we've made at least 18 long trips to Hungary where they serve food similar to Polish cuisine so we've had our share of sausages, borscht, etc.We ate at Stash Cafe twice during a visit to Montreal in August this year. On our second visit we also took a German friend. Quite frankly, we all loved this place and the food. Two other of our friends dined at Stash Cafe in the last month & also loved the food. The interior is cozy & has some nice Polish artworks on display. On both our visits were walk-ins, but it does tend to get busy, so perhaps reservations are a good idea. We had numerous dishes between us: bigos, pierogi, kielbasa, golabki (stuffed cabbage), & a wonderful charcuterie plate & even the smalec (a spread of bacon fat). Everything we had was delicious!

/user_details?userid=cXciolQyHZiW3uAB_dgPuQ,Ian L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My father's birthday was coming up, so as he is Polish, we thought what better place to go, than to Stash for some Polish food. I had not been to the restaurant in a few years and hoped it would be just as good.As soon as you walk in, you are met with that familiarity of having been here before. The piano player is tickling the ivories, the lighting is just bright enough, that each table feels like it is in its own little private area.If you like Polish food or have never tried it, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. There are dishes on the menu, that remind me somewhat of what my grandmother used to make for us.We started off our meal with drinks and being in a Polish restaurant, we started off with a round of Polish vodka, Wyborowa. Nicely chilled and a great way to start off any meal; but I guess any meal that starts with a round of drinks is a nice way to start.We got an assortment of appetizers to start with. A few people got the Flaki soup (a Polish soup made of tripes) and we also got pierogis, plaki, kielbasa, and sledz (herring). On a side note, I don't like herring, however, I decided for the first time to try the one from Stash after my brother convinced me that it is really good. OMG, he was right, I now know what herring should be made like (sorry grandma), but that was really good. What better to have with herring, than vodka, so round two was ordered. Hey, it's a celebration.Three people at the table got the sznycel wiedenski (veal schnitzel), someone got the Bigos (a type of Polish stew), and one golabki (cabbage rolls). There was a lot of sharing and trading of plates and each was excellent, although the golabki could have used a little more salt and the Bigos a little less salt. However, I would recommend either of those dishes in a heart beat. The portions are well sized and quite filling.For dessert we got struddel, although I was surprised that a Polish restaurant didn't have pączki (Polish doughnut). When I asked about it, when making the reservation, the lady told me where I could find them; but I wasn't sure if she meant I could bring them with me or she was just simply being nice and telling me where I could buy them.The meal, with tax and tip (and I was very generous with the tip because our waiter was great) was 308$. That was for 5 meals, 6 entrees, 2 rounds of vodka shots, 2 martinis, bottle of wine, and dessert. In my opinion and of those at the table, it was money well spent."

We even had a Polish waiter. I had the stroganoff with potato pancakes and salad. So yummy. My husband had the sausage plate and it was huge.

/user_details?userid=ZNS93MCO2vs0Ohb4P6C_IA,Anna P.,"Willsboro, NY",4 star rating,"Stopped by Monday during lunch rush.  Restaurant was full of guests.  My nephew and I liked an ambiance a lot. Service was very good and attentive, very good selection of Polish food. We had żurek, which was different than traditional Polish soup, too much of marjoram, no wild mushrooms, no hard boiled eggs, but it was tasty. Pierogies was the smallest I have ever seen, but very tasty. We had those to start the meal. Than krokiety, one meat and one mushroom, very good, flavorful, again: the smallest in size ever. My nephew had a special: crapes with melted cheese, ham and asparagus. Those were very good as well and very small. Both main dishes were accompanied with side salad, and in krokiety case, also potato salad. With salad arranged on a plate, the dish did not appear as small as it really was. We finished off with two fruit cobblers ( apple and peach one).  In short: we had appetizers, main meal and dessert, so were filled.  If we ate just a main meal for lunch, we would be hungry.  The prices were not bad, so we could buy more food. We are going to be back and try other dishes as well.  Overall we enjoyed our experience."

I had the platter, which came with a starter soup, main plate with pirogies, a meat filled croquette, potato pancake and pork & cabbage stew. The whole thing was followed by a peach crumble with a generous serving of cream and green tea (you could choose from other teas and coffee). If I had to criticize anything, the platter was very heavy, all one colour and salty. I couldn't finish the croquette which felt dry. The pirogies were the best part: covered in caramelized onions and half filled with meat and the other half were filled with potato and cheese. The potato pancake balanced the salty stew. I would come back for the pirogies, live music, great service and cozy ambiance."

Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)The menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming.  So points today for simplicity.If you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets.  A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec, something different than French!"

I was super impressed by this fact alone because two languages is hard enough! They were super friendly and we got some laughs. We heard lots of laughs from other areas of the restaurant, too.* The atmosphere was jubilant and friendly. It was comfortably noisy. Felt like a true polish restaurant. Oh, and go to the bathroom! The staircase up was totally medieval.* Lots and lots of alcohol choices - and of course tons of vodka! Take a look at their placemats for a little giggle. Do it.* The food. Oh my god, that food. Do yourself a favour and come here hungry. They had all the polish staples. The pierogi were simply fabulous, not too greasy with just the right amount of fried onion. It came with a truly polish cabbage salad. The potato pancakes (Placki) were delicious and came with a side of what seemed to be homemade sour cream. I myself and lactose intolerant, but my dinner mates gobbled it up along with their food. I'd suggest asking for apple sauce if you can't eat dairy.

I started off (with her guidance) with a Barszcz which is a beet consommé. My was it good. We also had the Pierogi entrée as well as shots of a particular Polish vanilla base vodka. For my main course I had the Kielbasa with egg salad and sauerkraut. The sausage and the egg salad were good but I really tasted Sauerkraut for the first time (again). It was absolutely amazing. Apparently it is prepared the right way there as they drain all the vinegar out of it by hand-pressing it for just the right amount of time and and a good amount of effrot actually yields a relatively small portion, but now I tasted real sauerkraut and I am a fan. The service and ambiance were great.

Our children are picky but we were able to get the pierogies without onion on top. The Krokiet was the best I've had with a nice crispyness. Best to call ahead for reservation!

I wanted the great open window, the old town building, and I had a hankering for fish.  I was drawn to this place by an aroma that tickled my olfactory senses a block or so down the street.     It had the great open window and a beautiful brunette greeted me and asked where I'd like to sit. She gave me a menu and a glass of water. I first needed a restroom, and beautiful brunette gave me directions to the facilities.       I've got to comment on the bathrooms, or rather the pathway too them.  Out the restaurants door I found myself in an old stone mason stairway, wooden stairs creaked as I climbed them. I could feel the history of this place. This was the old Montreal I was looking for. I savored the walk to the bathroom as long as I could, but beautiful brunette would be waiting for my lunch order.      The menu was good, and I found myself torn between two items.  In cases like this, I tend to get an opinion of an employee. So I asked beautiful brunette which item she preferred. She picked one and I ordered it.  It was a sautéed filet of sole, with a salad and potato. Beautiful brunette said it wasn't actually a polish dish, and I was okay with that.     The fish came out, it looked and smelled delicious.  A filet covered in slivered almonds sat next to a salad and skinned potatoes.  I ate them, and they were delicious. A band struck up a merry tune outside at a festival going on a few streets away.  Every now and again a cool breeze would blow in through the great opened window behind me. The meal experiance was magical.      Beautiful brunette visited me often, filling my water glass, and checking on my progress with the delicious meal.  The bill ended up around 20 bucks with tax and tip.   I'm way glad I ate here, and not at the five guys burgers down the street. I would recommend it, and their bathroom to anybody visiting."

The food... was fantastic. By far, the most authentic and identical to the homemade and dishes I grew up with.  The piergories, the second best I've had compared to my mom's.  The potato pancakes - perfect and served with apple sauce and sour cream.  (These are very hard to do right - they were spot on!)  Not too heavy and not to dry, the right mix of crispy outside and tasty inside.  My fiancé had the fish stew which comes with larger hearty pieces of delicious white fish in a tomato-like stew with vegetables.  This is not my personal favorite, but I liked it.Good selection of Polish beers, vodka and a full bar.  Service was very pleasant, and not slow. The food is definitely made fresh every day and well worth waiting for.  As another reviewer mentioned, even on the first visit - you feel as if you have been here before and already know everyone.  We finished our meal with homemade apple strudel served with a light sour cream sauce.  Price - was very reasonable and the portions are perfect (although you will be tempted to order more to explore the menu deeper!)One of the most pleasant experiences during our trip to Montreal - not to be missed!"

My wife really loved it. The polish sausage dish also came with some very scrumptious dill potato salad. The total bill for the 2 plates and 2 iced teas was around 40 Canadian dollars.

The borsch soup, though wasn't so good. In fact, it was just a red, salty broth. I was expecting something with texture.I ordered the debutant menu which featured a sampling of perogies, chopped sausage with sauerkraut, a deep-fried thing sorta like an egg roll with beef inside, and a potato pancake (latke?). Very nice. I just wish there was more sausage!The dessert (apple strudel) was just okay and not at all like the strudels I've had elsewhere. A strudel should have layers, no? This one was more like an apple crumble - a soggy one at that. And the taste was nothing special. Next time, I'll just order a la carte and get a main dish without entree or dessert.

My husband, son and I shared kielbasa, pierogi and galubki and they were all delicious. The service couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. In a seriously touristy part of town, this feels like an authentic, charming find."
/user_details?userid=1DiZw91c6xtC-3qJMAlwOA,Tina B.,"Woodlands, TX",5 star rating,"This was THE BEST Polish food I've tasted in a long-long time! Authentic, homemade-tasting, beautifully seasoned, very well-prepared. The service was great - always such an important aspect of any business! I was greatly impressed by the fact that the staff spoke at least 3 languages: French, English and Polish. Friendly, polite and helpful. Next time we are in Montreal, this will be my Montreal's #1 destination! :-) yes, it's THAT good! :-))"

/user_details?userid=wiiw1GIV26O2y_S01xka9Q,Melanie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,I liked the classy feel of the decor and the food was very good so I have no complaints there but the waiter taking his sweet time to give us our checks because he was more concerned about talking to the pair of women at another table was annoying.  It was to the point we didn't get our checks until the women were leaving.

/user_details?userid=L2lSnnyht3fB-ONcU2NaFw,Emory B.,"Cleveland, GA",4 star rating,Great place.  The food is delicious and considering its Old Montreal not terribly pricey.  The atmosphere/decor feels authentic without being kitschy.  The food is very good and decent sized portions.  My salad was fresh and green.  I wish there was a 4 1/2 stars.  This place deserves it.
/user_details?userid=8KTHqMcUXTGfguXozgFoZA,Georgia N.,"Astoria, NY",4 star rating,The food and atmosphere was really good! I love the decor in this place. The food was very well cooked and the pierogies were amazing! The only reason why they don't get 5 stars is because the waiter was taking his sweet time by talking to someone else.
/user_details?userid=XUqfnt21HvIHUEJ0mPBR-Q,Adam H.,"Bay Shore, NY",5 star rating,"O.K.   I have to start this review by telling you I cant be impartial! My friends go to Montreal every year for new years  and i started last year.  I found this place prior to my first trip, and after having a early dinner here we all decided it would be a staple. We all know that a great place this time, does not mean it will be great next time This was sooo not the case here!! The service...the food....the feel of the place!!! I couldn't  wait to come back, and i cant wait to go back!!"
/user_details?userid=HF8k3B7g7xk3wJZj3wK1Vg,Sherry Z.,"San Mateo, CA",5 star rating,"This place was amazing.  Their potato pancakes were delicious (Would have never thought to put so much garlic and sour cream and applesauce on it). Their dumplings were also very yummy and I had the tripe soup which was, once again, very yummy. Their dessert was also wonderful-- I had the hazelnut cake and it was the perfect, decadent end to a perfect meal. The service was also very professional. I would love to go here with my significant other."
/user_details?userid=_eon5rnS9LN8gH0NkQHVVA,Daniel Z.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",4 star rating,This was a great find a little off the beaten path in Old Montreal. The food here is traditional Polish fare. My mom and I both had the stuffed cabbage which was very tasty and filling. It came with fried potatoes and a red cabbage salad. The decor is very charming there are church pews and open windows all around. Also some nights there's a piano player who the night we were there played some jazzy tunes. Service is a bit slow to start but once they get to you it goes quickly. Recommended for anyone who likes Polish food or someone who's interested in trying something that isn't from a chain restaurant.
/user_details?userid=r8vO3DK-ydziuS_sT706wg,David W.,"Milton, WI",3 star rating,"We picked this restaurant because it had wide open windows (on a beautiful evening) and had a piano player.  The menu offered three choices for complete meals... a Polish sampler type feast, fish (filet of sole, I think) and roast wild boar.  The meals included borsht, a green salad, entre, dessert and coffee.The borsht was basically a beef consume flavored with beet.  It was served with sour cream.  Not like any borsht I've ever had, but not too bad.The salad came with a house dressing to compliment the lettuce (only lettuce) hence the ""green"" description.The Polish sampler plate was tasty and satisfying.  The roast wild boar was so dry and tough, it was nearly inedible.  According to the waiter, ""wild boar has a different texture than pork"" (apparently a shoe leather texture!).  I left all but  the first bite for the garbage bin.The dessert was an apple strudel and was very good.  My wife asked to substitute the poppyseed cake ($1 more) for the strudel.  The waiter  agreed to do it at no extra charge since ""I didn't like my entre"".  Honestly... the strudel was a much better choice!Clearly the most memorable part of the evening was the talented piano player who effortlessly turned Pink Floyd, Blackeyed Peas and other favorites into ""elevator music"".Next time, we'll probably stop in just for dessert, coffee and piano."

/user_details?userid=T-ci3jRz09lTOtO13qCBuQ,Laura C.,"Fort Mill, SC",4 star rating,"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Had the Debutant and split an order of cabbage rolls with my dining companion. Everything was delicious. The cabbage rolls were served with a nice, slightly spicy tomato sauce.  The filling was very tender and flavorful. Pirogies were also very good. The Debutant gives you a nice selection, so if you are not familiar with Polish food, it is a great place to start. If I was spending a long weekend in Montreal and could only choose two or three restaurants for dinner, this would definitely be on the list."

/user_details?userid=w0eFvridg4LMKQXtO-t-Kg,Kelly K.,"Huntersville, NC",4 star rating,"We discovered this place on a previous trip to Montreal, and it was on our list of places to eat when we returned to the city this past week. We got 3 big plates to share: potato pancakes with sour cream, a mixture of cabbage and cheese pierogies, and a pancake ""thing"" filled with mushrooms. It was all SO good. We had our 3 year old with us, so we couldn't linger and really enjoy the food like we wanted to. We had some potato pancakes left over, and we took them back to the hotel to maybe eat later on. They were ice cold when I finally got to them, but I didn't care. I still ate them."

The service was great and very friendly and we got food very quickly, which was especially important since we were starving. The food was great and tasted very fresh, I know my fair share about Polish/East European food and I have to say a lot of places don't do it justice, this  place does, so that's saying a lot and for a fair price. This is a place you should surely check out in you're in the area. Yum!"
/user_details?userid=1u6zz0xpKrIyjL0hljR2_g,Alan C.,"Santa Ana, CA",4 star rating,"Finally, Good food in Montreal. I was looking for good polish food and decided to try Stash Cafe. Very nice restaurant. There is a piano player and the ambiance is very relaxing. We ordered cabbage rolls, pork chop and pirogi. All we super good. Being from California, we never eat sauerkraut because it tastes terrible.  Many of the dishes came with sauerkraut and it was FANTASTIC. They make their own and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Make sure to get dessert also. :-)"
/user_details?userid=AF7HUYYtB3jovSdZrdqfig,asia h.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"Splendid - that's how I'd describe it. I'm a Pole, born and raised in Poland, spend there good 25 years of my life (out of 32, so I guess it counts for something). I visited Stash Cafe Bazaar with my parents, born, raised all-time Poles and a few friends and we were all nothing but impressed. Ordered barszcz, zurek (soups), krokiet with mushrooms (started), all of their dumplings and kotlets - all of which was splendid. Soups were nice and flavorful and tasted home-made, krokiet was delicate, not greasy, subtly mushroomy, all of the dumplings tasted awesome (meat ones would be my favorite) kotlets were huge and tasty. Only complain was from my dad, who wanted more of their side potatoes - he's one big starch-loving traditionalist) and from me to increase their Polish beers selection (although they had some nice local beers, so that's just my wishful thinking). Decor was very nice too, ambiance was great, live music added on to that. Prices were very reasonable too. Overall an afternoon at Stash Cafe Bazaar was the best ending to our Montreal trip - thank you for that! Best Polish food I had outside Poland for sure (except my own cooking that is ;)))"

/user_details?userid=NHBk6M0kbMEJ9XAox8PD7A,Jay T.,"Kew Gardens, NY",2 star rating,"Not a fan. Was really looking forward to a nice polish meal in Montreal, but this was kind of disappointing. The food was meh, not horrible, but just kind of bland. The restaurant itself felt kind of stuffy. Combination of a warm, crowded room, with warm water being served, mediocre food, unengaged service, and a piano that was somewhat too loud, just made the experience a bit uncomfortable. Wouldn't come back."

Cafe Stash features excellent Polish food; pierogi, sausage and sauerkraut, hunters stew, and a variety of other specialties. Décor is Polish lodge, and service very fast. I highly recommend Café Stash for lunch or dinner in Old Montreal.   This is a moderately priced restaurant."
