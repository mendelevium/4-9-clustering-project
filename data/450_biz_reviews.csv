It appears to be part of the Barroco Group. Super Loco was open for takeout only due to the COVID-19 restrictions, I am not sure if they will open up for seated dining when restrictions ease. The takeout window is pretty cool and looks more like a South American mini-mart that contains Guatemalan chips, Mesa, Mexican Soda, etc.My experience was mixed, starting with a fairly lengthy 25 minute wait for my order. There were about 10 people hanging around waiting for food on St. Paul, I think the kitchen got backed up due to a large order. I'll chalk that up to new kitchen operation kinks and assume they will work it out.I ordered a pork sandwich, a veggie sandwich and a chicken empanadas to share. The sandwiches where huge, stacked high with ingredients, and finished with an orange sauce that I thought would be spicy but ended up being bland. The Mexican style bun was good but I thought it should have been warmed up,. We both thought the sandwiches were A-OK but not great.The empanadas were another thing all together, absolutely delicious and served with a yummy fresh and vibrant salsa. They were baked to a crisp golden perfection. This dish is worth waiting for and I will gladly return to load up on all of the varieties!"
