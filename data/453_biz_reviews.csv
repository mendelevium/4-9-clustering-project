It is very near our lab and it is our most favorite place for lab discussions, especially after a long week of frustrating results on Thursday or Friday evenings.I really like the servers here, they are very attentive, even if the place is full and they are going crazy!The house beer is only 4$ and this is what I order when I am cheap.Otherwise, they do have other beers and interesting cocktails if you are willing to spebd extra :)For a bar place, it serves very good food with even vegeterian options! I enjoy their chicken wings too. They have live bands during summers. And if you want to watch the hockey match with friends, you will love this place."
/user_details?userid=pwIZ8XOrHgBNZaqLsfke3g,Kathy D.,"Fort Pierce, FL",4 star rating,"I haven't managed to visit this pub when they have entertainment but on my most recent visit they had some nice 80s music playing while the football game was on. There was a new small menu and I tried the Mac n cheese with smoked meat, some of the best I have EVER tasted. My husband had a spicy chicken wrap and onion rings he enjoyed very much. Best of all is the excellent service we always receive, it really means a lot to us. I have been to other pubs in Montreal where your drink is completely empty and no one cares... :-(This place has a lively vibe and employees who clearly enjoy their job. The restrooms are on the same level so no stairs! I love this. My only complaint would be the fish and chips... the fish was breaded, frozen kind and so fishy tasting."

They also have a great open mic night on Tuesday. Many beers on tap. Warm wood based atmosphere for the low light pub experience. The food is pretty good. I have had the nachos, the poutine. I've seen the burgers and wings. All is good bar fare. Lots of tvs. 5 stars  because I i have kept coming back despite the competition of the area. Enjoy!!!"
/user_details?userid=tejGH-sqC2iRz2ZQTZgsqw,Ed A.,"Weehawken, NJ",3 star rating,"It's an Irish pub a half block from the busiest stretch of pubs in Montreal (Saint Laurent). On a day when I walked for blocks hoping (but failing) to find a bar that didn't have a line of 20 people in front, this pub had no line at all. In fact, it didn't have much of anyone inside when I got there on a Friday night. Nightlife isn't its strong suit. At least they had a nice selection of beers and some fast & friendly bartenders, which is more than i could say for other places I visited."

/user_details?userid=3shnYp5XKNIAwFF_rq9QPQ,Bob N.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,"The kind of pub you feel at home the minute you walk in.  Visiting from the states found this pub across street from hotel, became our favorite go to for a pour or three.  Kilted staff are great - Mike the manager offers up great stories and humor - and makes this Irish pub authentic.  Did not eat there but food looked real good.  Music on some nights."
/user_details?userid=ulk3n0JW8tWnQ83C7m8z9A,Jay L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,We were looking for a place to grub as we got into the city late but wasn't able to make it here before the kitchen closed.  They allowed us to bring in outside food which was really nice of them!  Unsure if it is an ongoing policy but I sure hope so!  We ended up bringing in a few pizzas and offered some to the staff behind the bar. #winningThis was a great place for a group of 12 of us to grab some drinks after arriving into the city for about 2 hours.  The staff were friendly and it wasn't too busy on a Thursday night which gave us ample room to settle in.We had a couple of pints and had a jolly good time! :-)

We had mushrooms & Swiss hamburger and grilled chicken burger. The portions were generous but flavor was nothing special."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Fun staff! Nice play to chill and relax after work if you just want a beer or if you want something to eat they have a great menu.Gets busy on weekends but that's the point lol.
/user_details?userid=UH6RCH9K1o2VW3CU8PY5iQ,Julie B.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,"We were looking for a place to grab a late night dinner and this pub served food until midnight so we found ourselves here at 11:40 pm, starving. It was a typical pub with plenty of tables and table tops in addition to a long bar. We sat a table top and a server immediately brought us menus and took our drink orders (Guinness, natch). I had a French dip that came with fries and a cup of lamb barley soup. Pretty decent pub fare; everything was tasty and not greasy. The place got really loud when a cover band came on and busted out with some Pretenders and U2 tunes. It actually got a little too loud for my comfort level but then again, I'm getting old. Surprisingly, it never really got crowded in there, even though it was a Saturday night and all the surrounding bars seemed packed to capacity. Well, I guess not everyone likes cover bands? If I lived in the neighborhood, I would likely frequent this pub as long as they took the band's volume levels down just a notch."
/user_details?userid=A4Wk81wYwDecI8vIs63TiA,Giorgio B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Very nice ambiance. Very limited vegan options though. Notably the veggie burger is not vegan while it is vegan at other pubs like McKibbins. Please add more vegan options. I had the veggie curry (vegan) and samosa that we were told initially that were vegab but they weren't. Please make your samosas vegan!
/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Adding to the horde of existing positive reviews, I must say that Ye Olde Orchard has a great laid-back ambiance and a nice staff. As soon as I set foot in the pub, I felt like at home. My husband and I each had a veggie burger; it was decent and warm, served with a side of fries, a typical dish. He had Jack Daniels on ice and I had a specialty coffee, the Nutty Irish, which tasted great.This simple and short visit was very pleasant and relaxing. We are very likely to visit again in the future. Heck, it's been only a few days and I already miss that coffee!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Top notch pub! I came here with a large group of people and the vibe was jovial, the service was wonderful and my hot toddy was hot. It was BLOODY COLD outside and the warmth of the crowd, the staff and the booze seeped into my core and cured all that ailed me. This was my first time coming to Ye Olde Orchard, but it won't be my last! Somehow, it kinda felt like home but I'm an Irish-Canadian Maritimer after all. It's damn cozy, on a heart and soul level.I ordered poutine, which was standard - not the best in the city but certainly not the worst, either. My partner had nachos that were pretty good. It is pub fare, after all - really, you're not there for the food, but for the charming stone walls, boisterous patrons, reasonable prices, easy location and casual camaraderie. I'm thinking this would be hangover breakfast heaven.  The place was full to the rafters on a Wednesday evening, and it sounded like there might have been some live music happening later in the evening - somebody was having fun testing a microphone, anyway. I couldn't stay for the show, but I'd be curious to go back to check it out sometime. Four YARS for me mateys at Ye Old Orchard. It's as pubby as a pub gets."
/user_details?userid=OyWhTonjjiaIzjSeNPeGcA,Koji S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very much the impression of the friendly neighbourhood bar - I was there on a Friday evening, and the crowd was perfect: enough people to talk to and create a warm atmosphere, but not so many that I couldn't find a seat. Not filled with students trying to get wasted. Many friendly people open to conversation. Prices were reasonable at best, but the selection was solid, the experience made up for it + they let you taste a few beers before making your choice."

/user_details?userid=qn1NZziyQoPXXLzgJ_iQgg,Glen S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Felt like some pub food while in Montreal and found this place near to where I'm staying. Atmosphere is pretty chill and the music is great (if you like classic rock).  Service is mediocre (waiter forgot my soup), but they have some good beers on tap (house lager is pretty tasty) so I call it even.  I had the steak and mushroom pie and a baked potato which hit the spot.  Not out of this world but what I expected. I would come back, but would order something else. The burgers looked really good.I gave them a 4, but if I could have I would rate them at 3.5. I would probably come back"

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I usually go to the Monkland or St-Sauveur locations but stopped in at this one after a day of gallivanting on the Plateau. It's a little small but they also have a few tables set up outside - perfect for those warm summer days. Well, if we ever get them! The service was good, and when asked for a 'birthday drink recommendation,' the waitress suggested one of their 'homemade' creations: the Bourbon lemonade. HELLO! It was served in a pint glass and they weren't cheap on the Bourbon so... no complaints! What I especially like about this location is that it just feels like you can walk in at any time of the day, pick a corner and just chill out without anyone bothering you. Love it. I didn't have anything to eat so can't comment on the food. That said, if it's anything like Monkland or St-Sauveur, you've got nothing to worry about. They typically serve food throughout the day, including breakfast/brunch; their menu is quite varied so there's something for everyone - even you veggie lovers :)"
/user_details?userid=vrmFLUxupn5JI3PqT_28Zg,Brian W.,"Stamford, CT",4 star rating,"Great English style pub right off of St. Laurent. There's a ton of Montreal beer on tap and the bartenders are great. Around $7 for a beer or mixed drink, but worth it and expected in the city. The had a two-person cover band tonight (Reuben and someone else) who were fantastic. Only thing I can't comment on is the food. Definitely check this place out."
/user_details?userid=yFEImrDzBHZpH7489UlvwA,Michelle A.,"Clifton, NJ",4 star rating,This restaurant was a convenient 5 minute walk from our AirBnB. The ambiance was super cozy and the LIVE ENTERTAINMENT was very tasteful and relaxing. The food was amazing and the portions were enormous! They're definitely shareable portions since our group of 7 ended up taking up half of what we ordered. They have plenty of VEGETARIAN options as well! I got the veggie curry and it did not disappoint. Staff were very friendly as well.
/user_details?userid=Gv2wHeY8sQuyEUS8yX56HA,Paul G.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,It is a good place to stop for a beer.  It is on a side street so is quieter and has open seating facing the street which is very nice.  They have beer specials so just ask.  It is a small pub.  Waitress wears a kilt and is friendly.  Food is nothing special just pub food.  Has 3 tv screens.  Has a genuine pub feel to the place with stone walls.  I would return.
/user_details?userid=nicGnkYxQLXQFHAcNp4rsA,Steve X.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"All I can say is the food is very good, and a fan of their pub style. But the wait staff,......phew! really need to work on them. I had some very bad service here. Those kilts sure don't help them be better at their job. I've been here many times, and the last time i went was from a waitress who really needs an attitude change. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars and being nice is because the food is great and don't want to take away the whole restaurants integrity just based on the wait staff."
/user_details?userid=2gH7UiJcs3auEn9azJjhEw,Sandra V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Started coming here due to the worldCup and discovered that they have great nachos. Will continue to go back even if the World Cup is over. Nice little pub.

She totally messed up our night. She doesn't deserve to get any tips and do that work. I hope she meets a same waitress when she get any restaurants. Except her, this pub is cool."
/user_details?userid=NrevV_Ku8WCNZC4tyzg7SA,Melissa S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really live this place. It's close to home, the vibe is always inviting and friendly and most importantly, the food is on point.I've tried a few of their dishes and they have always hit the spot. If you're looking for a satisfying yet healthier meal, their salmon is great. I switch out the rice for mashed potatoes. Less healthy but super delicious. If you're a vegetarian, the veggie burger with sweet potato fries is sure to please. But if you're looking to really indulge in a comfort food classic, try the beef stew.  Huge portion with amazing gravy, big chunks of beef and vegetables, all nestled in a bowl with a mashed potato ring around it. Perfect."
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Exactly what you expect from a Irish pub: good food, friendly staff, relaxed vibe.A few items worth trying:- their burgers- their curries- and their Irish Toast at brunch (French toast made with Bailey's)"

I would describe this pub as ""chill"". It not big as such but that's what gives it a very comfortable feel. The nights when live music is played are the best; one is more than happy sipping beer and smiling."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A GREAT place to either stop by for a pint, a bite to eat or watch a game.I began by frequenting the 'original"" Ye Olde Orchard"" on Monkland years ago but since they have branched out to downtown and St.Laurent, I usually meet up with friends at this location.Was here yesterday meeting up with a friend for brunch. Both of us had the Highlander Breakfast complete with sausages, ham, bacon, scammbled eggs and their IrishToast (French toast dipped in Bailey's). They also have that Dr. Seuss classic ,Green Eggs and Ham (It's actually scammbled eggs with pesto)!Friendly service, a great menu, very good food and a laid back vibe make this a great spot along the Main to just chill and relax with a friend or more."
/user_details?userid=WVzff6WDqhqksu8pkVZvFQ,Madita A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place for a beer with friends, watching hockey or a casual dinner.Enjoy a good variety of local and Irish / British beers in a great location. The place is really quite big, but the room is divided up to create comfy smaller areas. If you come here to watch a game, you will find there is no shortage of TVs, and you get a good view from everywhere.The menu offers quite a variety, from burgers and other pub fare to Indian curries. The special house salad is a huge concoction of fresh greens and veggies, with a tasty dressing. The Indian curry was a little low on the spice level - but hey, it is a pub! Might be a better choice to stick to the classics."
/user_details?userid=orI43AUZELMBpz3jBD0_fQ,Polyester B.,"Enterprise, AL",4 star rating,"We were here before and after a JFL show and had a great time.  We had an awesome bartender.  The menu was hit or miss as were the menu prices, but we would definitely stop by here again.  We shared the nachos, which were just ok.  My husband enjoyed the Cajun chicken sandwich.  I ate the Bonda -- one was enough after the nachos - and it was delicious, but I would have appreciated a dipping sauce with it.  Again, great service and Irish pub ambience."

Sri Lankan options are fantastic - our server told us that much of the kitchen staff is Sri Lankan so they make great dishes. Nachos were wonderful, good selection of beers, wifi had a password.

/user_details?userid=0b6EVoYxrt1U9U00kf5uig,Lacey N.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Our first food/beer stop in Montreal-wasn't too bad. We both had some draft beer and poutine (which was delicious). They had the Rangers/Tampa game on so every way you turned your head you had a great view. Pretty good and friendly service, we will return here again!"
/user_details?userid=mT8t8hA_ElPvHgQq2pQ4oQ,Rose L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really good for watching play off games, especially on a Sunday or Monday. These days their happy hour goes until midnight. Lower tier draft beer is $5 a pint, their house beer is only $4 a pint! On Sunday they also have 1 lb of wings for $11. The medium spicy and the cider barbecue were both quite good, you can do half and half for the 1 lb order which was nice for variety. There is always plenty of room so you don't have to worry about what time you get there. The service was very good. Perfect English and French."
/user_details?userid=GxP5hy5t4aTOyIiO05jL1A,Victor T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"First and last visit. Decided to sample their fish and chips as it seemed to be a typical dish on a pub menu. Three fair portions of fish with rather cool tasteless fries. All in all, the fish plate at $16 was not memorable, the fries were cold. The beer ($7.83) was excellent though. Service was OK, but cold. Not an experience  I would care to repeat or recommend. Felt cheated out of $30.40 (including tip)."
/user_details?userid=mROok9JZx19AwvOJlI8FHQ,Art O.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Awesome pub not far from our crappy bed and breakfast. We walked in here after a long flight from SF and this place was perfect. I was turned on to the St. Ambroise beer at this place and so I had a have a few pints to start my trip to Quebec right!The food was better than most pub fair in SF. I had the beef and mushroom pie and it was so great, I kept ordering on our future visits here.They also had a cool cover band (just two dudes - drums and guitar/vocals) which was surprisingly good! I later realized that the music scene in Montreal is a bigger deal than other cities I've been to.Best of all was the service! Each of the servers (especially the young, darker dude with the permanent 5 o'clock shadow) was very welcoming and professional."

Food is good quality pub grub but I would say pretty expensive. I heard great things about their curry but was a bit dissapointed, might have ordered to wrong thing.  For $17 it tasted like the jar of curry sauce you buy in the grocery shop.I would say that its a decent place but you are looking at $25 for a meal and a pint, which is kind of a lot."
/user_details?userid=M5cOI1lQW_d-JOMK0gZAGw,Jo K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An Irish pub that offers a consistently great experience. The last time I went they still didn't have a full liquor license, so you had to order a meal with your beer but that's never been a problem considering the pub fare they serve is above the norm. On different days of the week you'll get to experience bar trivia and great live bands with some decent acoustics in the place. I've always had great service from their friendly staff."

/user_details?userid=D0E-lGF7zXUJjFJEgUePsQ,Alexandra G.,"Alingsås, Sweden",4 star rating,"This pub is right around the corner from our place, and I feel very blessed about that. It has a cozy authentic pub feel (not commercial). It looks a bit rustic with big wood floors and custom-made bar tables along the side. It feels buzzling and busy without being to loud. Obviously it is great for watching games with all the screens but I like coming here for the food too. I mostly eat from the Pub menu which has meat pie, Irish Stew, steak and Guiness pie - all warming wintery foods that I eat year round. I have also had some sandwish there, it was comme ci comme ca. Lots of food for the money actually. On Thursdays they have a band that plays Rockabilly, it is quite groovy. They have pub quiz one night which doesn't sound very exiting to me but had some friends mesmerized for hours. Think it was a Wednesday."
/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am a regular at this Olde Orchard location because its food is excellent (I adore their burgers and onion soup) and its beer selection impressive.As with other Olde Orchard locations the food ranges from pub fare to burgers, steaks and curries. I stick to the burger section and have never been disappointed.Beer-wise, I prefer the local brews to the imported ones. They are cheaper (even more so at happy hour, which runs until 7-ish IIRC) and stimulate the local economy. My picks are the Cream Ale, Apricot Wheat and Griffon Rousse. In the imported section I dig Smithwick's, Newcastle Brown and Cidre du Minot cider. It is excellent.The wait staff are always great and help create a good mood. They will gladly recommend your next tipple if you're undecided.I love this place, and so should you."

All the food is excellent, and I highly recommend substituting the sweet potato fries since they're delicious. A good selection of local and imported beers on tap. There are pub quizzes, regular live music, and all the Habs games on the big screen with sound, plus some Euro, World Cup and select Premier League football matches. The waiters all wear kilts and the service is friendly as. What's not to like?"
