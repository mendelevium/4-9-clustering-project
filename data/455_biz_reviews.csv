/user_details?userid=p6giCgCiZ1fNgLg75L9xjw,David C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My wife and I had to find a caterer only five weeks ahead of our wedding.  Kimberly and her team at Miss Prêt à Manger (our main contacts there were Zoe Dascher and Jonathan Albert) answered every question and request that we had extremely quickly and set up tastings for us in no time. They were attentive to what we wanted, to our budget and soooo helpful. We were given great assistance with everything from wine and drink selection to finding a DJ.On the day of the wedding, everything went off beautifully. The staff were a well-oiled machine - but a machine that was attentive to us and to our guests. All of the food was delicious, guests' wine glasses were kept full, wine was served at the right temperature, drinks were mixed exactly right and we could not have been more pleased.To be honest, we were a little concerned because we knew that Miss Prêt was also catering two large events on the same night as us and there was always the lurking fear that our little event might be put on the back burner.  Wrong.  It may be that the personnel we had was the ""C"" team but even the ""C"" team was impeccable.  It is rare to find an organisation that does carries  its mission with soul and with tremendous organizational skill.  Miss Prêt à Manger carries this off with aplomb.Recommended without reservation or hesitation."

The overall aura of the restaurant is super mellow. Thanks, Miss Prêt!Now, onto her music. I've been following her SoundCloud (@labluesy), soooo good! Her playlist is my playlist now.Thanks for catering the McGill Management International Case Competition. We had a blast!"

Why, do you ask, am I writing a review if I haven't eaten here? Because so far, the service has been exceptional.I'm getting married and was looking for a caterer. After going through about 50 different places and getting quotes, I landed on this business. I did some research online and saw that almost every single review was raving about Miss Pret a Manger.Kim & Zoe have been so helpful and patient (yea I'm a bit intense.. I'm European. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it) with aiding me in choosing a menu specifically to suit my needs. Every single email was answered almost immediately and every phone message was returned within the day.So far, I can totally see why everyone is raving about the service at Miss Pret a Manger and I cannot wait to see what Kim & Zoe have in store for me food wise on that special day!!"
/user_details?userid=7mZrMbJG9mJuH6RX3e3X6w,Dina A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Small-ish portions. I took the salad duo. One was called Bondi and the other choux frisée. I Payed around 10$ and was a little dispointed when I got my to go box. That is, until I started eating! It was so fresh! So good and so filling! Don't be fooled by the smallish box! The two salads were filled with high quality ingredients like pecans, goat cheese, sweet potatoes....I really liked it. I might go back to try their soups! Oh and the service was excellent!"
/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had the Asian sensation salad - made up with a big mess of really fresh vegetables; lettuce, shaved Napa cabbage, scallions, carrots, celery, spinach, red cabbage, tomatoes, chopped parsley and everything good for you that you know you should be eating. The salad is topped with a bundle of sesame peppered cold soba noodles and seared sesame crusted tuna with citrusy-soy tataki sauce. Jokes aside, the thing was substantial, paired with the trio of salads to start with, my insides were burning from all the vitamins and rainbows and smiley emoticons.I was full. Could it have been the slices of bacon or blue cheese baguette? Probably not. It's rare that I would write so encouragingly about a friggin salad, but I am - so please go out and purchase your lotto tickets accordingly. Yes, breakfast is most important meal of the day, but I strongly believe lunch comes in a close second. A meal that will provide you enough energy to sustain you through the afternoon before your evening dranks is equally as important, but not as important as keeping you awake and not knocking you out with a food coma once you get back to work. With a never ending rotating roster of inspired and healthy lunch specials, it's a great alternative for people who need a quick bite to go, or have the time to sit down for a proper lunch - all food groups represented."

By and far, Miss Pret has the healthiest food on that dismal block (everything else is burgers and beer). However, the portions are teeny-tiny. I went a few times, each time ordering a different salad combo (yum!). But they would fill most of the to-go container (about two-thirds) with a few pieces of big lettuce leaves so that the main only filled one-third of the box. Each time I was left going, 'ok, so where do I go for a real meal now?' The kitchen also re-uses so many of the main ingredients across plates that in fact, you're left with few options in the end. i.e.) sweet potato is in many dishes, as is spinach etc.Every time I've visited they seem to be overstaffed (sometimes 8 people visible behind the counter when there are only 2 customers), and yet I've had to wait very long for my food."
/user_details?userid=1XdFW0RivEP2koAlRYrZYw,Lisa B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I sampled the canapes at Yelp's Belle Mo event, which were provided by Miss Pret a Manger. I have to say, the ones I tried were not only delicious, but also really well-presented and cleverly put together. Canapes can sometimes get a bit dull, if you're going to a lot of events, and for anyone who is hosting an event and looking for something a bit different, I can highly recommend Miss Pret a Manger. The vegetarian cocktail sticks, with tomatoes and cheese were gorgeous, and the salmon pate was served generously on the crostinis."
/user_details?userid=kxXr01bsJDQ_OdNWVZafGA,Dale D.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"I stopped in at this restaurant for lunch on my last visit to Montreal. It was around 2 p.m., following the lunch 'rush'. I was greeted by Kimberly who was sitting at a table working on her computer. I was offered a table by the window, which is perfect on a rainy day to watch life go by.I ordered the Asian chicken soup, and a Salad with grilled chicken. Service was warm and friendly and very attentive. Chatted with Kimberly who interacted with every customer that walked in the door. Many customers are on a first name basis with the owner (Kimberly) and enjoy the personal attention.There is an open kitchen concept with plenty of amazing aromas finding their way in to the dining room. The food was great, beautiful presentation. Dessert ( Kimberley's carrot cake) was a must even though I was stuffed!This restaurant is not open in the evenings, so lunch is your only chance to enjoy this great venue.Say hello to Kimberly for me!"
/user_details?userid=Wzri7ilDXMawJf-_Xhuq6Q,Emily M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This place was wonderful, possibly my favorite meal in Montreal so far! Go here! The staff was super friendly and very attentive, more than I can say for other dining experiences in this city. They were cheery and helpful, translating the entire menu into English for us with no attitude or annoying looks. We ordered and in the meantime were served a little taster size cup of their soup of the day, and brought out some little breads that had blue cheese and walnuts(!!!) Delicious. Our entrees were large and the healthiest looking things we had eaten since we arrived here. I had the salmon tartar, which was mixed with avocado and mango, and came with a behemoth sized salad. My boyfriend had the grilled bass which came on a bed of broccoli rabe and rice, topped with some sort of Mediterranean salsa. Both were fantastic. The tartar seemed to have the perfect ratio of avocado to fish so it wasn't goopy or anything, his bass paired with the greens was a wonderful combination as well. We split a ""famous bar"" for dessert, a graham cracker crust bar topped with chocolate, coconut, nuts, etc, which was the perfect sized sweet treat for after such a lovely meal. The prices seem about right for Montreal restaurants, and with such a friendly staff and fun ambiance I wish I was staying longer in the city so I could go back!"

Kimberly Lallouz and her team were exceptional. We had a 50 people wedding party in our home that they catered. Miss Pret made it one of the nicest evenings I have ever had. The food was absolutely outstanding, the service was amazing, they cleaned up beautiful, they were fun (Zoe even danced with us a bit!) .. I can not say enough good things about these people. Thank you for making our wedding party a memorable, fun, delicious and amazing evening! Heidi & Lenny"
