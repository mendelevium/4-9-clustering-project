We love the warm, relaxed atmosphere and will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=EIlVB_rky4VA6rx9oETJNw,Jim V.,"Menlo Park, CA",5 star rating,"Oh my - this is definitely best Greek dining experience in Montreal. Let's start with the fact that the flavors are darn close to what my Yiayia used to make. It was ""instant comfort food"" for me. It helps, too, that the owner's son made us feel right at home. It makes total sense, as this is a family owned restaurant that has been in business for decades. We've now been back many times.The restaurant also has a very cozy ambiance, despite the fact that there is a LOT of seating. In the summer, I recommend the outside patio. My favorite dish is the chicken souvlaki, which is not only grilled to perfection (i.e. not over-cooked), but the marinade is this mouth-watering-very-much-like-home flavor that keeps me asking for more.This is a place you can go with family, on a date, or even a business lunch. The prices are reasonable and the food is beyond satisfying. PS: If you like wine with your meal, not that it is a ""bring your own"" kind of place."

It was a bit busy but still got a great seat, service was quick and our waiter was friendly.Pros: great chicken with the honey sauce.Big calamari rings with a sweet tomato sauce.Salad was flavourful.Cons: calamari body were over cooked couldn't eat themSaganaki was deep fried and not what I'm used to.Great little place but once you know what you like off the menu you will have a wonderful night."

/user_details?userid=OC7pX0AVsJY2heO454Drjg,Jonathan P.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I love them. It is not my first rodeo, and they're always great. I placed a phone order and went to pick it up. I asked for the chicken souvlaki from their Table D'Hote menu, and they usually don't include the soup to go, but the guy told me to bring a bowl or container and he would give me their lentil soup. And it may seem like nothing, but they make the best lentil soup in Montreal, it MATTERS!I didn't even ask for a dessert and he included it. I live in Toronto, where we have Greektown and 100s of Greek restaurants, and none are better than La Maison Grecque. Great service, great FRESH and HOMEMADE food, great overall experience.Thanks for a perfect meal!"

/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",4 star rating,"Great resto for byow. The shrimp plate or the surf & turf are amazing. But the last time we went, something changed.. the soup used to be much better, but it lacked tastiness, kinda tasted like canned soup(both the lentil & chicken soup). Great for groups, nice ambiance, good price too."
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",5 star rating,"What a nice restaurant this turned out to be from start to finish I could not have asked for better service, it was an overall totally wonderful dining experience. LMG is a byow resto with a limited menu hitting the Greek food highlights; delivering some of the best perfectly cooked lamb chops I have had anywhere. The first standout was the house salad with their house made salad dressing, I would return just for that in a New York minute! The waitress said the chef makes it everyday and it has some 30 ingredients, I don't know about the 30 ingredients but at first bite I was elevated to a new sensory salad dressing experience that was mind altering. Ladies and gentleman this was an absolute palette explosion of dynamic yet variegated subtle flavors that will leave you speechless, breathless and with heart palpitations, it did me! Quebec lamb is some of the very best, even if you don't like lamb this would be the absolute perfect place to put that silly aversion to rest permanently. Cooked medium rare with hints of lemon and rosemary the flavor was downright scrumptious. For dessert I had the Galaktoboureko, one of my favorites; it too fell right in line with being one of the best, not overly sweet Greek desserts,I have had. It is interesting this restaurant was not my first choice as I was on my way to another Greek restaurant down the street but the line was out the door and I didn't want to wait. I have dined in many Greek restos in Montreal over the years; they have all been very good, some I have returned to several times. La Grecque Maison will be my first choice when I am in Montreal craving Greek food from now on hands down!!!"
/user_details?userid=nB1k_D08ybNk_CS-a3fAyw,Chris C.,"Gardena, CA",2 star rating,"Stopped by, largely due to the positive reviews, but we must have hit it on a bad night. We had souvlaki, salad, calamari with potatoes and rice - very standard fare, but each dish was very poor. The calamari was as if was from frozen and had a very dry batter. The souvlaki had an odd, tangy marinade that I did not care for at all. The pork itself was very tough and undercooked in spots. The salad was very old, the potatoes we were served had skin - which is fine - but were clearly unwashed and tasted literally like dirt. The rice was cold and dry. Whatever the reasons for our experience, we won't be back, despite the warm interior, the food was not pleasant, at all."
/user_details?userid=El9mDDq1L9dKRnp6WNPx7A,Sta K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My third time visiting. Their lentil soup is the best soup I've ever tasted and you can tell their food is made with love. Juicy chicken as well. Great music, prices,atmosphere and family run."
/user_details?userid=wHGUmUio1-j3zg_ObIoG9A,C K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Terrible experience. It took at least 15-20 minutes to be served, another hour to receive the food. The scampies came without any lemon, which took another 20 minutes to get, and the waitress forgot twice (it was actually a busboy who brought them as soon as he saw we were impatient). By then, they were cold and inedible. We couldn't ask for fresh ones because no one came back to us. Both dishes (per menu and waitress confirming) were to be served with rice. The person who brought our plates just dropped it in front of us, without saying anything, and we had to call them back and ask where our rice was.Another 15 minutes - halfway finished our plates - and they said rice was out. We asked for a credit of any kind, as why are we paying for a full plate when items are missing? The owner came to us about 30 minutes later, and refused to give any kind of credit though we paid for an item not there. He just stood there staring at us, and we had to explain our question over again. He was so condescending and never had a smile or even apologized for this experience thus far. We were calm and smiling but he was cold and made us feel humiliated. He said if we wanted to wait another 20 minutes, there would be more rice. Keep in mind that this simple meal had thus far taken HOURS and we already finished our plates. He also said the next time we come, he'd give us 3 rice plates to make up for it. Right; he would not even give a 50 cent credit but promised more food next time. How would be even remember us? He wanted us out of there. Again, this was the owner. There are so many better locations on the same street that go above and beyond for customer service, food, and ambience. Also: the deer mounted on the wall and dimly lit bathrooms seal the deal."
/user_details?userid=7WRLKCJVJdTOweV3wcKEjQ,Julie R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I chose this place for my birthday in February after having been just once in summer. There is tons of room for groups and you don't have to reserve much time in advance. I knew the food was good, and it was BYOW (and next to an SAQ!).Generally speaking, I feel this is a laid-back place where you can eat decent meat (not sure for vegetarians!) All in all, I think most of our table was happy with their orders, although apparently the onion soup was horrible. The proteins were well cooked to order (I had Filet Mignon) and most dishes come with salad and soup, which is nice. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Also, their terrasse in summer is amazing at the back of the restau, lots of flowers and somewhat hidden from the hustle of Duluth."
/user_details?userid=vUs5c95PoB6t4wF4xtSs9A,Julia P.,"Fultonville, NY",4 star rating,"You will not leave hungry! The setting is very nice and not only do they bring you a big basket of bread to start off, an entree comes with soup, salad, rice and potato (with food) as well as coffee and a dessert. The food was good and was not pricey for what you received. Great service as well, very friendly. Good spot if you are hungry and looking for some fresh, (mostly) healthy options."
/user_details?userid=EoJ-OCkagVNoKu7IDICZrQ,Nili A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, the ambiance is very cozy, the service is very good, it always has space for large groups, the food is yummy, and the price is reasonable! Also, it's byow! This combination is rare to find!"
