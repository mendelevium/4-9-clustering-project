Every week the selection changes based on Chef's inspiration and availability. Not only is the tasting price unbeatable, but the quality of dishes and ingredients that you receive far surpass expectations.Between the four of us, we had 3 services and 6 dishes. The first service included a roasted carrot salad with goat cheese, an arugula salad with fried calamari, and a creamy beef pasta. The two salads were top notch; the carrot and goat cheese offered the perfect sweet/savoury combination. Quite honestly, I still daydream about the calamari in the Arugula salad. The second service included a chicken, chorizo and cashew dish, and a mackerel plate. Finally, dessert was a bread pudding.The service was great. Our waitress knew her stuff and recommended the perfect wine pairing for our tasting menu.The restaurant is very small - cute and cozy though, not crammed and squished. Reservations are a must, and they're taken pretty seriously as I had to give a credit card # to hold."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Small but cosy place on Plateau, I wasn't expecting them to have good brunch options but oh boy was I wrong! Their steak and eggs were top notch and Mexican eggs on tortilla were delish too. But their king brunch choice is the Big Feast, humongous plates (more than 1...) of eggs, potatoes, pork chops, bacon, giant rib steak, blood sausages and more. As we were explained, this ""dish"" easily can fit 4 grown human beings or 5-6 of average eaters. Yes, it cost $145 but once you divide it between 4-6 of you it's not so bad and once you see the size of that steak you will understand what you will have to work with...Definitely a great experience, ambiance is awesome, service is perfect and the food is fantastic. So yes, I am getting my butt there back again!"
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Chien Fumant has the atmosphere down, a quaint corner restaurant on a street which counts two of the best eateries in the area - Maison Publique and Quartier General - as neighbors. Ultimately, and especially if I'm comparing to either of those gems, I always find myself reaching deep into the pockets coming back without too much in exchange. For one, the restaurant doesn't always know what it is; I suppose 'Mediterranean Italian with French and Asian influence' might be apt, if that weren't so vague and confusing. Two recent pasta dishes were fine, nothing I couldn't do at home, and one dimensional (great margins for the owner though!) and a chickpea purée with lamb was heavy, gritty and odd, and barely livened up by the few limp mint leaves strewn around it. A calamari appetizer, also fine but cheaper Asian places do them better. Egregiously, the plates that appetizers were meant to be shared on were dirty, with a really unpleasant film over it. I had to actually return the plate and instead of any apology, just quickly wiped it down so there was a bit less film in it, and then returned as though my request for a clean plate was a hassle. I felt compelled to apologize, and did, but then on reflection- F* that! My plate was dirty! The wine by the glass is ok, the list only gets interesting if you begin to spend a lot for a whole bottle. The waiters were okay- speedy service, but not terribly friendly. The beer selection was non existent. (Sorry but Labatt doesn't go well with any food for me.)Each time I come here I am lured by the promise then the food comes out good, but averagely so, nothing sparking great, no complex sensations, or coming close to the sublime experience often conjured by those at Quartier or Maison. But the price mimics those places, so to me it's not worth it, except for the atmosphere."

/user_details?userid=VC3HG0L6EPtWCxc7N-ZApg,Nick P.,"Montclair, NJ",4 star rating,"We came here on recommendations and I have to agree with the other comments, this place is awesome!The atmosphere: She really loved the setting of this place, it's nestled in a neighborhood like it was a little corner store. The atmosphere in the place is great, there's a bar central to the main seating area where you can see the cooks at work. The other seating is by the window where you can look out onto the neighborhood. Very romantic setting, 10/10.The food: we started off with the beef tar tar which was excellent! It was a Korean style plate with kimchi and an egg, very creative. For entree I had the lamb and she had the pasta. The lamb was served as an Ethiopian dish with collard green and beans served on a pancake. For creativity alone I was very impressed! The meat was tender and the sides flavorful. The pancake wasn't really that close to an Ethiopian Injera but it was good, more like Aunt Jemima ;) her dish was very good as well, the only issue was it was so tiny (look at the picture, mine was literally 4-5x larger!). She did order the smaller size but the difference between the small and large were just too much. And the price wasn't that different.Overall we were both really impressed! The only downside and the reason I can't give it 5 stars was the pricing. While the food was great the prices are too high. The quality was good but our dinner was over $100. Otherwise, the waitstaff were excellent and very friendly, we both highly recommend the place!"

We usually stay in the Plateau when we visit Montreal, and my husband had noticed this restaurant several years ago and always wanted to eat here.It's a tiny, lively restaurant with an open kitchen and maybe 10 tables plus bar. The food was a knockout win-win for us - everything was incredibly rich but not excessively so. Highlights for me were the chanterelle appetizer and the tagliatelle with lobster in a rich lemon beurre blanc. My husband loved the entrecôte soaked in butter topped with rich escargots confit."
/user_details?userid=8vijC91d3ekAbGuDLgzSfw,Sara C.,"Auburndale, MA",5 star rating,"The rating is based my dish and preference. My party made a reservation a couple hours before hand, it wasnt that busy and the crowd was extremely friendly. My party shared the Korean Steak Tartare, which was so balanced in flavors and well seasoned.I ordered the Duck Confit which was phenomenal. It was fried so it had a crispy outside and the vegetables surrounding it were so fresh.My mother ordered the seabass which was just as good, a little salty for her tastes, but tasty none the less. When we went there the staff did not speak English very well, but we were able to get our points across and engage in conversation. They were friendly, respectful, and attentive to us awkward Bostonians.In conclusion we had an amazing time and I would definitely go back next time I visit Montreal."

Main: Cavatelli veal shank, Greek yogurt, Lemon confit + Hanger Steak, mash, Provençale Tomatoes  = Devine, we could not finish...Desserts: Classic Queen Elisabeth Cake with Home Made Vanilla ice cream + Lime Pie, coconut, marshmallow and chocolate- coconut syrup = my date needed a moment to gather herself, let's leave it at that. Champagne and wine kept us company throughout the nite. There are many restaurants in Mtl...but only a few good ones. Le Chien is part of my top 5."

Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar, salivating at the dishes being prepared in front of your eyes.

Like some of the other reviews, we felt very rushed and were told what time we had to leave as soon as we sat down. Server was cold and unfamiliar with the menu when we asked for recommendations. Dinner was good but dessert was not to our liking. We ate only a small portion and were never asked if we enjoyed it. Also, we were brought the wrong bill (for less than what we owed) and when we informed the server, no thank you or apology. Would reccomend going somewhere else. There are lots of great restaurants in Montreal where the employees actually care."

They have amazing drinks and are doing some very creative things in-house, drink and food-wise. The ingredients are as local and great as the people. It is a great place for a night out alone just sitting at the bar, a date, or a small group; very unpretentious. The menu changes each month, and I am always excited to see what they come up with next."

/user_details?userid=Rvn-Ymc8_9z4vbcm2ZwenQ,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Dinner here was amazing! I learned of the place thru the travel magazine AFAR and I'm so glad we went. It's outside the touristy neighborhoods so I loved the very local vibe and the fact that the menu was only in French. The staff were all very nice and helpful so we had no problem ordering. We had the mushroom puff pastry appetizer (5 stars!) which was so delicious. The mushrooms tasted so fresh and aromatic. It was a very flavorful dish. We also had the oxtail stew (4.5 stars). It was hearty but not heavy and the use of different textures made it delightful. Then we had the duck with cherry sauce with lentils and green beans (4.5 stars). Also delicious. The meat was tender and moist and the accompanying lentils and beans made it a very satisfying dish. For dessert I had the strawberry bavarois (4.5 stars) which was very yummy and light but the portion size was too much. Since we were sitting at the bar we watched as the chef prepared the dishes and so many other things looked amazing. There was the carpaccio and bone marrow plate that looked amazing, the escargot, and the rib steak for two that looked divine! I wish I could go back! Interestingly the experience made me think of M. Wells in NY not just because M. Wells was a Québécois diner but also because the dishes there were all exciting, unpredictable, and bursting with flavors. That's exactly how Le Chien is. The restaurant is very small so I highly suggest you call for a reservation. And the menu changes often which only makes the place even more likable. The wine list is excellent but their cocktails are also very good. I had the boulevardier and I enjoyed it very much. I was also surprised how reasonable the prices were. Dinner like this in NY would easily cost a lot more. Especially considering the generous servings. This definitely made our visit to Montreal memorable. I would go back again if I'm ever in Montreal again."

/user_details?userid=-IhLzUOGA4TAXl0CgtY4SQ,Taner B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,It is a cool neighborhood restaurant. There are not too many seating options as the space inside the restaurant is quite limited. Make a reservation! The bar seats are overlooking the open kitchen. I enjoyed the Chinatown calamari and the lamb with red wine. The food is fine but quite overpriced. The service can get sluggish if it is a busy night. During a busy night it can get very noisy!

/user_details?userid=c0Cau2zsD-63GFVnUvo0Uw,Isabelle Anouk B.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We went to Chien Fumant on Wednesday. Three business women, one of us who has been going there for years. We had been warned that we had the table for two hours only, and the reservation desk had asked for a credit card number to hold the table which was quite unusual for a neighborhood bistro and only three guests. We sat and the waitress recommended the tasting menu. For 30$ each, the chef was to select plates and courses. We decided to go for it. We wanted to order a bottle of wine but the waitress insisted that we tried their cocktails. We did. She brought our drinks and before we could taste them, she brought all the food, probably 5 plates. We asked her to slow down the pace and let us have our drinks, that we wanted wine with our food. In no time the chef was at our table, asking us to leave not to complain in front of other guests. It happened so fast we were completely floored and in disbelief. But we left. It was the first time anything like this happened to me. I think this chef needs a serious break. Behavior like this is enough to sink a business in no time."

Passion for food and drink is evident, and each time we are here becomes a celebration, even with no occasion! The charcuterie boards highlight Canadian delicacies and we love to bring visiting friends to sample local or made-in-house specialties. Definitely a menu for meat lovers, try the tartare and steak. For a vegetarian dish, I recommend the 'halloumi cheese, cruncy salad, dates & tahini' We have yet to try their famous brunch, but will be back without a doubt! The classic and experimental cocktails are also lovely, and this is a very sexy place to sit at the bar solo, and sip something strong while the world goes by. Their website describes them as being ideal for ""restauranteurs, nightowls, curious and 'bon vivants' that never say no to a surprising dish."" I would agree wholeheartedly; bring your curious side and you will not be disappointed!"

He insulted me repetitively calling me (man) with a condescending posture like I was some guy transacting in the street.

I enjoyed it, it's definitely a nice small ""unique"" restaurant.Went there with my girlfriend, we shared the chinatown calamari (very good, a different twist on the typical calamari entrees).We both got the pork, (the menu is written on a chalkboard, so it always varies). The food was good but the plate was definitely very small. We then shared a brownie desert which was very big and really tasty.Overall I would recommend this place, not too expensive and definitely a cool ambiance.I also noticed there is no information on what to expect price wise anywhere onlime ( their website menu does not post prices, and since the menu is on a chalk board we cannot know what to expect, so to help you het an idea I will give you the prices of what we ordered:- calamari entree 16$- main dish (pork woth octopus) 30$- brownie dessert 11$Hope that gives you an idea, the main dishes range from 20 to 40$"

/user_details?userid=DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,Josef-Konrad R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Le Chien Fumant is a bit out the of the way, reservations are a serious consideration given its teensy tiny size, and it is a tad pricey considering brunch for two cost close to $50 without any of their signature cocktails added to the bill and before a tip was added in, but these are just trivial worries when you factor in the flavors, freshness, quality, and the uniqueness of the dishes offered here.Everything is homemade, from the English muffins used in their lobster Florentine Benedict, to the cured meats and sausages they serve up during the day. Who does that anymore? The food offerings are as unconventional as this restaurant's decor that welcomes you with a giant poster of the 1957 B-movie classic ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" at the front door, features Wild Wild West flourishes straight out of a Frontier Town bar, and places 8"" religious candles on each table in place of the typical tea lights one might find elsewhere. Their ever-changing yet playful menu was the impetus for this first visit. I've checked out their website often over the last few months, just to see what was on the menu after hearing about this place, and have been teased with dishes like rabbit done gumbo style and pork belly served up as a doner kebab.   Their brunch menu this past weekend was no less eclectic. While you could order some ""basics"" like ham and pineapple, or eggs served with homemade country sausage and biscuits (Biscuits? Real Southern-style biscuits in Quebec?), I indulged in two quivering chunks of boudin (blood sausage) served atop an apple waffle that was accompanied by a frisée salad with lardons and two perfectly poached eggs. Worth the trip and spending a good 45 minutes on public transportation and a 15 minute walk under dark, ready-to-burst, cloudy skies to get there? Oh yes, yes, yes.Worth making a reservation even though a credit card was needed to secure it? Fine by me and perfectly understandable given its limited seating.Worth the cost? Hell yes, especially when you factor in their choice ingredients and how they handle them, the attentive service, and the fact I've only seen breakfast and brunch items this creative in Las Vegas. Worth a return visit? Already booked."

I had the gnocci (very average) and the doré (fairly tasty). They do have a decent number of vegetarian choices but the menu on the night I was there was fairly meat-heavy.

We were one of about 4 tables, so the joint wasn't quite jumping.  Between our party of 4, we had the famous Chinatown Calamari, which is the only item permanently on the menu, zucchini flowers and lobster in grape leaves for apps.  Mains: ribs & scallops, turbot dieppoise.  The calamari was good, overly sweet and the zucchini was good, if a little heavy on the bread stuffing.  We all agreed, the lobster in grape leaves was a fail.  The  mains were both well executed if not especially stellar and unfortunately the Korean ribs were sold out.It's not that we didn't enjoy the meal; as a neighborhood resto, it's very good but given it's out of the way for a lot of folks and tourists almost certainly, it may not be worth the trip.The service was good and I can imagine when busy, it could be a fun place."

Overall, though, the service was really pleasant and our server helped us pick something off the menu (we understood almost nothing). The ambience is amaaaaazing. Really great place, hole in the wall, but with personality. Also, a guy sitting at the bar got so drunk that he fell off his seat and backwards INTO someone else's table.

/user_details?userid=lu88gy8PbYPBaH1jgkmy4Q,Dan G.,"VA, VA",5 star rating,"So our friends who live in Montreal made a reservation here for the four of us on a Saturday night and it definitely did not dissapoint. Restaurant was tiny and only had 3 tables which could accomodate more than 2 people.  They had several two-tops. Our firends had been to the restaurant only one time previously and enjoyed it (obviously).  Living in DC with some of the best restaurants and variety of cuisines, we are always slightly cautious about what people think is good.  We ordered some drinks, the smoked meat appetizer, and discussed our dinner options.  We decided to do the ""small"" tasting menu.  We ended up getting four appetizers and four entrees which were SUPERB!!!  The amount and quality of the food for the ""small"" tasting menu was overwhelming. Every one of the dishes was delicious, had interesting flavors, textures, and was cooked to perfection.  I generally dont like lamb and my wife does not generally like any fish, but we both loved the lamb dish (one app & one entree) and the halibut entree dish.  My favorite dish was the korean bbq tartare which was awesome.  I wish that they had some more wines which were under $50 a bottle.  We ordered one of the cheapest bottles and it was still $57.  With the four of us we ended up spending quite a bit in wine.  Also, they did not have any wines by the glass so you either had a whole bottle or drank cocktails.  Probably one of the best meals which I have ever had and definitely in the top 3 or 5 of all time."

/user_details?userid=PPgEaJQc3W35CGJUyy2R1A,Const P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Despite reading recent negative reviews, I decided to finally try out Le Chien Fumant against my better judgement. What struck me first was that it was empty for Sunday brunch. Brunch in Montreal is usually synonymous with long lines and high volume. One table of customers was being served while the rest of the staff awkwardly loitered at the bar. When we were ready to order, I asked if my eggs can be done ""over easy"", to which the waitress responded that they are done sunny side up. Confused, I asked whether the chef can flip the spatula and turn over the egg, to create an over easy egg. The waitress came back and said that the restaurant ""does not have the equipment"" to do my eggs over easy (sarcasm noted). Meanwhile, an unshaven and disheveled-looking manager and kitchen staff at the bar stared at our table, smirking, and seemed to enjoy watching our confused reaction. It was very awkward and we felt like we were being attacked. Needless to say, we walked out after the snide remark from our server, as we have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant setting. Nobody stopped us from leaving nor apologized. I understand a chef that does not want to change his cooking method, but I will never condone the staff of a restaurant treating patrons with sarcasm and disrespect. An establishment that is this small, empty, and off the beaten path should be very weary of letting a customer walk out with such a bad taste in their mouth. You've received an onslaught of negative reviews recently (particularly for service), and it is now blatantly obvious why. Word of mouth is a POWERFUL THING, and we will make sure to do our utmost to dissuade family, friends, and colleagues from funding your unmerited arrogance. As a Montrealer and food lover, I can easily say this was the worst restaurant experience in my own city."

The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked, and the sauce was velvety and unctuous.I highly recommend this restaurant. It was one of the more memorable meals I've had in the past year."
/user_details?userid=acN81m0RL9tXw9IlQv3OTw,Maryna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Went to have brunch there past Sunday with my friend. The food left us speechless. We ordered breakfast enchilada with pork and homemade pancakes with strawberries to share and both plates turned to be delicious. They also have a great coffee-inspired cocktail list for those who feel like having a drink. I definitely recommend this place to everyone who cares about great food & superb service.
/user_details?userid=EUtFaImcQQq5YDCRL1dHHw,Adam M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Chien Fumant -can- be mind-blowing.This is a small (let's not say tiny) restaurant at the corner of Gilford and De Lanaudière. They offer an early and late service; customers are the expected to only attend one of them to allow new patrons to come in. This can be off-putting for slow diners and people who like to talk a lot.The strength of the establishment is its menu. The chefs of Le Chien Fumant make much of their ingredients in-house, and the dining menu--written by hand on a blackboard--is frequently refreshed according to the seasonal availability of fresh items. You would have to go every day of the week before you could possibly have the same dining experience twice.The arrangement of the restaurant is fair and attractive, but can create some snags. During the winter, tables near the exit are subjected to cold air with some consistency, and all year long customers will have to deal with a somewhat cramped space and only one restroom. This is a minor inconvenience if you dedicate yourself to the tasting experience, however. Meals are always exotic but accessible, and diners are invited to discuss their tastes and adventurous leanings with the staff and chefs to take smart decisions about what to put in their mouths. Provided you are ready to trust the presentation, you will be rewarded with a fine foodie experience. The chefs of Le Chien Fumant have laid in front of me plates in which I recognized nothing edible, and plates in which I immediately identified everything I hate. In both cases it was stupidly delicious and eatable.This is evidently not a cheap place. Le Chien Fumant bets on quality and all of their items are priced above casual dining averages. It's worth it to reserve and plan in advance so that you do not end up ordering the dish you can afford instead of the one you really want. The same can be said about the cocktail and wine list: very good, but somewhat pricey. That being said, I can only give Le Chien Fumant a warm recommendation. It would be best to bring along a friend with foodie leanings to discuss the presentation and texture of meals, but regardless of background or tastes, Le Chien Fumant offers a decidedly above-par dining experience."

Portions are generous so consider sharing. We had a Chinatown Calamari salad - superb - and shared half a roast chicken complete with mashed potatoes and peas. Wow, simple yet divine.    Also come prepared to wait OR make a reservation. And order a cocktail, their drinks are creative and well executed."

/user_details?userid=pUTpFPTFQobDv7rsO1x3xw,Devin D.,"Boston, MA",1 star rating,"First of all, this restaurant is small and waiter didn't explains to us since everything is in French and I'm from Boston. We just order from what the waiter put down for us. I ordered Steaks and pasta since he said should be good for 2 Adults and 2 Kids. The bill came out $148 I order Steaks on for his suggestion $50.00 on board but somehow he put down $100 steaks. Plus we waited for the food to arrived at 45 minutes. I would defintely not going back ever gain. Bad service and rip off prices."

/user_details?userid=9L02W-cPfUQvgf_uyxZWHw,Robert R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Love the decor dislike everything else. I love good service, I tip well when it is deserved.... Almost to excess. However I can tell you that there was absolutely nothing to tip over at Le Chien Fumant. The food was not very impressive and the wait staff were dreadful, rude and un helpful. It would have left a bad taste in my mouth if the food hadn't been so salty that my mouth shriveled up. Overall unpleasant.... And I am a glass half full kind of person!"

The ravioli was bad, bad texture bad taste, just bad, can't save that one, i make better raviolis....rack of lamb was a big mess with sauce and all kinds of things... i was hoping for a nice rack with a crispy crust cuz that's what i was craving, instead it had more of a stewed consistency, and it did not taste too great...we skipped dessert because the portions are big here... didn't have room for dessert... all in all, the calamari will bring me back, but i'll be trying something else and hopefully i'll find a good main dish here yet...The staff were very friendly and the place is welcoming, i like the atmostphere here."

I took a friend there and we both had the korean short ribs, which were made to perfection with an excellent kimchi side.  The food was perfect, but I was loved the atmosphere and am excited to go back."
