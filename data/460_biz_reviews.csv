These hip Mile End obsessives focused in on 5 menu items and executed with musicality. As far as slices in MTL go, Adamo finally has a contender in its weight class. Don't sleep on the hidden menu homemade ranch and spicy honey sauces! My girlfriend's only complaint is that I've been going too often - 5/5 don't see myself slowing down.

/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"How many slices a week of Toni pizza is too many? This is exactly how I love a pizza slice: crispy base that doesn't flop around, delicious hot toppings, keep it basic and classic, then drizzle me some ranch! I absolutely love this place. Small menu and they do it right. If you find yourself needing a quick snack while you're out - this is the place.  The whole pizza serves 4-6. But heats up well the next day if you're less and you can thank me later. It's hard to not stop in for a slice when I pass by. Which is often, maybe too often...?"
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite pizza place in Mile End and I have tried nearly all of the ones near me. Their concept is simple and straight forward. No bells and whistles just pizza. They do not have too many options just pepperoni, margarita, cheese, square? We usually get margarita, classic flavour. The full pizza is $26-$28 depending on the flavour you choose. And it's absolutely massive. Two slices should more than fill up a big eater. To give you an idea of how large it is, the box does not even fit in my oven. The crust reminds me of authentic NY style pizza. Thin crust, crispy, yet chewy on the inside. They have two sauce options: ranch and hot honey. Both are very good, but I'm a ranch girl through any through. Try it!"

Beats out Slice & Joker next door, La Main Folle, Adamo and anything else you put them up against. Classic, simple and small menu with not a bad slice to be found. Bonus points to the best customer service in the city that continues to surprise me everytime i visit, which has been 2-3x a week at this point. Staff are very passionate about their job, pizza  and the customers they serve. Alex is the man, and you can tell he really cares. Would give 6 stars if possible!"

/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Lots of pizza places opening up in the mile end recently. Something must be in the air. I really love the aesthetic of this place and the slice was actually very good for someone who doesn't usually choose pizza to eat when there are so many other options. Fast service and friendly staff, super excited to see how my friends will like it."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't like bashing other businesses in my reviews but I want this review to be objective and transparent and comparative with what can be found in Mtl. I tried La Newyorkaise, Adamo and Slice/soda. At this point I thought Montreal was just not meant to have NYC style pizza. While Adamo was the best out of these three, it still lacking in structure and texture.And then comes Pizza Toni. Now this is a fantastic slice, crispy without being hard, a beautiful texture enhanced by semolina (I think that's what it is, but could be polenta). The toppings are simple, high quality and perfectly balanced. Perfect! Bravissimi! I will definitely be a regular."
/user_details?userid=Vp5RDiX9I4c-kWX6Ws-s8g,Skye L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I don't like to post negative reviews but customer service was awful. I ordered a pizza on the phone. They said 45 minutes. I arrived an hour later. When I get there they say there was a problem with the pizza and they need another ten minutes. I was pretty disappointed. If they were being honest about this problem they should have had it fixed by the time I picked up since i was 15 minutes later than previously discussed. What frustrates me was their indifference. Anyhow, I left. Won't come back. Terrible customer service."
/user_details?userid=FIT6RkObw-oclsY7eDTeNA,S M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Happy to have this pizza place in the neighbourhood but also happy that there's some other competition opening up soon, from the looks of things. Pizza Toni has great decor and delicious crust, price is OK (for mile end), but the state of toppings is just absurd: tomato sauce, cheese, and the occasional basil or arugula leaf does not real food make. My standards aren't high, but this is embarrassing - Montreal isn't a food desert."
/user_details?userid=XCd2bgbWo0v_u4aVPRmrQA,Isabella R.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,Truly amazing pizza that doesn't make you feel bad or instantly stuffed after eating a slice or 2. Prices are good and their attractive staff definitely is a plus!
/user_details?userid=xHEVocQxAjMqTycnIHZl8Q,Brian S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is exactly what Montréal needs to change the horrible culture of slice pizza on the island. They are using organic Bianco di Napoli tomatoes, the infamous Ezzo Pepperoni from Ohio and block mozzarella that is shredded in house. The saviours that we all were waiting on! Thank you Pizza Toni."
