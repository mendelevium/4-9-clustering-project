/user_details?userid=HhRcq4INJlID3helYAcLug,Melissa H.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"Once I saw the name of this place, I HAD to come here! I ended up coming for brunch on a weekend, and while it was definitely busy, it was still really easy to get a table for our party of 2. They have quite a bit of seating both indoors & outdoors, and the space is super cute! We tried the brunch tartine & the Melisse casserole. The brunch tartine was good but the Melisse casserole was amazing. It reminded me a lot of shakshuka and was a lot more flavorful than you'd expect. One of the dishes (can't remember which one) also came with a side salad, which was possibly the best side salad I've had: it came with the perfect amount of dressing so that it was flavorful but not soggy at all. The coffee here is also really good!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious food but disappointed in the drinks. We got the salmon tartine and the porchetta tartine. They were both served on a bread that had a strong grilled flavor and it was great. The salmon was fresh and complimented the veggies and sauce well. The porchetta was very soft and perfectly salty. We got the lemonade and the iced tea. They were both extremely diluted and it felt like drinking flavored water. As for the service, it was great and the food came quickly. The place is quite big and it's nicely decorated with plants. Would definitely come back for the tartine."

The restaurant is simply beautiful with easygoing but elegantly decorated. We came in for Saturday morning brunch, and we were received enthusiastically. The restaurant was very busy; it took a while for our waitress to attend us but after taking our orders, our dishes arrived promptly. Every single item was presented beautifully, and each item was delicious starting with our smoothie, strawberry mimosa, banana hazelnut bread and fried egg, cheese and salmon sandwich. We devoured everything happily. The prices are steep but the quality is superior. Definitely, this place is a must."

From the decor to their delicious meals, I wish I could give them more than 5 stars! For a week we were staying in Montreal, we ended up going to this place twice and we weren't disappointed at all. Let's start with their delicious Latte. My husband and I are coffee snobs and I couldn't find anything to complain about their coffee! It was so good and really really smooth. The first time we were there, I ordered Wild Argentina Shrimpswith grilled pineapple and soup of the day (split pea soup) while my husband had breakfast tartine and we both really enjoyed our brunch. I had some dessert which ended up being quite sweet, but I didn't really mine since we were on vacation. On our last day in Montreal, we went their for breakfast and I had this amazing banana bread and smoothie. As writing this, I can't even stop thinking about how good everything was and dreaming of my next visit!Bonus point: I love their bathroom! Absolutely clean and organized. They also have TV in it. I love the soap they use -- environment conscious and smelled really nice! Their staff was also top-notch! I think these awesome things I mentioned should be enough for anyone to give this place a try!"

I loved the decor it was so cute with all the plants and the service was good.We had the Tartine Martin, Sandwich Dejeuner/with ham & a smoothie. Everything tasted great and fresh, perfect for breakfast."
/user_details?userid=YA_kmtQExvqu8q3jkHIEjg,Alyssa C.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"We had an incredible dining experience at Melisse last night! We were in town celebrating a friends wedding and organized the bachelorette dinner here. We had a group of about 14 and they were very accommodating. We had called prior to ask if they would separate the checks and they were wonderful about it.The food was incredible. They have two appetizer options, two entree options, a few meat and cheese board options, and a dessert menu. The menu seemed to be mostly seafood the night we were there. Thanks for the great experience for our group!"
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband and I had brunch here recently. The food was good, albiet pricey since the portions were so small. The ambiance is trendy and a bit froufrou. It was full of yuppies and DINKs (just being descriptive and not perjorative because we actually fit into both these categories, lol). The menu is only in French, so good thing nous sommes bilingues because otherwise the server would have had to explain the whole menu to us, like he did for the pair sitting at the table next to us. Why not have a bilingual menu and save the staff the hassle?Anyway, I had the green beans, mushrooms and bacon salad ($8) and my husband had the egg salad on toast with a side salad ($11), he added bacon to this for an additional $2. My salad was tasty but really tiny. I should have also asked for the dressing on the side because it was drenched in oil. Also the menu said there were potatoes in my salad but there were no potatoes of any form in my salad. Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed my salad. The saltiness of the cheese and bacon really complemented the sweetness of the green beans and the different textures in the salad were excellent. My husband enjoyed his meal, although I noticed that his toast was burnt. The bacon was thickly sliced and looked delicious. I had a taste of the egg salad and it tasted whipped and fluffy. My husband had a coffee ($2) and the sugar they give you are cubes shaped like card suits (although mostly hearts and clubs). I thought this was super cute.It's really loud in there though, but I'm great at tuning other people out, haha, so we still had a good time.Service was courteous and efficient. I was hungry again shortly after, but it was still an enjoyable experience."
/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"My weekends usually consist of trying out new brunch places and on one rainy Saturday I stumbled upon Mélisse with a friend.Everything about their decor is beautiful, there are cute corners everywhere you look and it's obvious they put a lot of thought into the design. The staff is very friendly and attentive, although a bit slow at times. Okay, so let me tell you about the food. I got the pain poêlé. It's similar to French toast, it was served with a lavender crème. It was absolutely delicious and not overly sweet. Some people may think the portions are too small but it's a perfect portion and you won't be left feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. I've been here multiple times and you definitely don't want to miss out on their pastries. Everything from their croissants to their scones are absolute perfection. Add one of their delicious coffees for a full course and you'll be left daydreaming about this meal for weeks to come. I'd definitely recommend and Mélisse is a welcome new favourite to the Montréal brunch scene."
/user_details?userid=8AatsWCP9rka3CRuMknCKQ,Michelle T.,"Nashville, TN",5 star rating,"Pleasantly stumbled upon this place for brunch after visiting an art gallery nearby. We sat at the counter and enjoyed friendly but non-intrusive service. A few weeks later I'm still thinking about the main dish I had, which was one of the most satisfying brunch dishes I've had in recent memory: sausages and green lentils with poached eggs and a side of grilled bread. All of the pastries in the glass case by the window looked tasty, too!"
/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So pretty and peaceful here despite MAJOR construction going on all around them. Some days I actually long for winter. A cabbie once told me there is only two seasons in Montreal...winter and construction.  Very clever, Mr. Cab Driver. Wanted to try this place forever and this week I've been twice!  The breakfast tartine with salted salmon was small but amazing!  The chai was on the sweet side. I'm finding that many places use a ready made mix from a carton which is disappointing.  Not sure if that's the case here, but it was sweet.  I prefer a spicy chai. Another day, I came in just for coffee while waiting for the rain to lighten up.  The service both times were great!  I can imagine how hectic it could be for brunch as it is a very beautiful space, elegant but not stuffy. I got to enjoy its serenity during their off time.  Great space to do a little work or just daydream."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This quaint little resto located in the old port has a super cute outdoor space too. We opted to stay indoors; the space was modern with touches of vintage chic, comfy chairs and a great laid back vibe. We ordered their strawberry mimosas and the casserole Melisse; if it's named after the resto, it must be good, right? Slight mixup with our drink order was readily rectified and although the mimosa lacked in alcohol, it was still light and refreshing, The casserole with potato, ham, mushrooms, cheddar, a fried egg and sourdough bread was perfect! Great flavour thanks to the harissa, nicely perfected and presented. Portion was just right as was the price for this part of town I would totally return to this spot for brunch; although a little out of the way from core Old Montréal, I enjoyed the food and feel of this cosy resto. Perfect way to start off a lazy Sunday."
/user_details?userid=R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Melisse is a modern place where you can enjoy a coffee break with a friend. The design is really minimalistic with a touch of modernism, the ceiling is high, the place is white, and The terrasse is wide.The food is not to die for. I went today with my mom for lunch.We ordered the mezze tapas or they call them "" les a cotes "". Overall the food doesn't meet my expectations as they were high!The soup du jour was a dried tomato soup with beans and Parmesan. Nothing fancy. The grilled salmon with pineapple is fine.The kafta was bit dry, the bavette with chimichurry was good and tasty (for a $9 plate) and the epautre salad with eggplants was tasteless.On the coffee side, I tried the  latte and it's fine.The service was very decent. The waiter and the hostess are very friendly wich gave me a very good impression."
/user_details?userid=noLV2HHn8FwWtR50vSHtNA,Laura A.,"Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is now one of my favourites in all of Montreal! The decor is sooooo nice, the staff is friendly, service was quick and we didn't even have to wait for brunch on a Sunday. I had the summer salad with zucchini and Quebec strawberries and it was sooooo good. I'm a huge salad fanatic and this one gets on top of the list for sure!"
/user_details?userid=wCT6anc87_Wp1OX32mMc-A,Elina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"I am so glad I got a chance to enjoy a breakfast here during our visit, beautiful airy space, we did not have a reservation( definitely recommended) but our gracious host put us by the window on the other side of the main dining room, worked out great since we had a stroller. Great choice of dishes for every taste, I opted out for a egg salad tartiné and added gravlax salmon to it, absolutely delicious!(obsessed) Got a smoothie to go as well. Will definitely come back if in town."
/user_details?userid=edGZZ_-4nSzBNwJHh5z6pQ,Allie L.,"Mendham, NJ",5 star rating,"My friend and I had breakfast here and loved it. The atmosphere is gorgeous and the staff is so kind. They even let us decide which table we preferred. I ordered the green juice which was delicious, as well as the breakfast sandwich and cappuccino. It was all so good and presented beautifully. My friend had the shakshuka and agreed it was wonderful. This was the perfect brunch spot and if ever I am in Montreal again its one of the first restaurants I'd go back to!"

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Melisse is a hidden gem in Montreal and I feel like I almost don't want to review it so that it remains my little secret. I went here to meet my friend's roommate two Sundays ago after we finished brunch at my apartment. We weren't very hungry but decided to order coffees while our friend ate her brunch. I had the most adorable chai latte and wish that I would have tried the food. The ambiance is divine; it definitely does not feel like you're in cold Montreal when you're inside. The large, garage style windows let in so much light and the greenery makes you feel like you're in a warmer climate. There was a group of bougie women who decided to have a photoshoot in there (they even brought a photographer)! It is a sweet spot for a very girly brunch and I recommend it; although getting a table is tough. Be sure to make a reservation or come early."

/user_details?userid=qgYjGrYlavOWCG8cPZAB8Q,Sharyle D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"We enjoyed a lovely dinner at Meliisse. We started with oysters from PEI. They were accompanied by a mignonette with tomato paste, different but brilliant with the oysters. We had shrimps and scallops for our main course.  Both were perfectly cooked. We shared a brownie ala mode for dessert amd it was sublime. The service was excellent. Fabulous!"

/user_details?userid=56pxEGEDkGR5vyLrCCFKMQ,Nancy J.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,I've been to Melisse a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. Not only is the food great but the place is stylized very nicely. The service is one of the best in Montreal and the coffee is a local Toronto roast that is perfectly handled by the barista.
/user_details?userid=j-BCdG72_y5U7Qkb9HBiFg,Bianca B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Nice place decor-wise. The place is clearly new and needs a LOT of practice. Friendly service but inefficient and slow. Food is good but the plates are small and heads up, you'll pay $2 for a slice of bread."
