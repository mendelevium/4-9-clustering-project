/user_details?userid=8C8Ml7hj1zxyhcChk1TESQ,Danica C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"I visited Elena during my recent visit to Montreal. I arrived on late Sunday evening and choice of good restaurant was very limited. I am so glad that Elena was one of few restaurants opens late on Sunday. We arrived around 8:45pm and the dining hall was full. However, we were able to sit at the bar table immediately. The bar seating was very comfortable. The service was very friendly and prompt. We were greeted by friendly manager and the people serving us were very friendly too. They explained the menu clearly and answered our questions patiently.  We order Diavolo pizza and Tagliatelle. Food came fairly fast. Diavolo is made with organic flour and very soft. It has a slight aroma from the flour. My dining partner who doesn't prefer eating pizza praised about this pizza many times. The in-house made pepperoni was not overly salty like other places. Must try to eat the pizza with house made spicy oil. Tagliatelle was my favourite. The pasta was so thin and bouncy with eggy taste. The Ragu sauce was so flavourful yet didn't over power the pasta taste. It was very impressive and I think it is the best tagliatelle I had so far. We also tried the special dessert - Roman Holiday - 3 scoops of strawberry sobert with fresh fruit and wafer. The sobert was refreshing and the whole dessert was nicely made yet it was pretty pricy for it."
/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"A fresh new contemporary, Italian spot in Place St-Henri. The thin crust mushroom pizza is to die for and the Kale ceasar is also equally good! You are bound to miss this spot as it is very nondescript on the outside. The decor inside is beautiful pulling some mid century flair into this very unassuming spot. It's not overly pretentious that can be common of many newer restaurants. The service is friendly and efficient. Elena ranges on the more affordable side and you won't break the bank eating dinner here.The only reason I'm docking a star is because we were three people crammed in at a two person table. There were plenty of other tables available around us. I'd had made this reservation a month in advance so a little disappointed. This place gets pretty busy so make sure to make a reservation.I would highly recommend nonetheless, it's a perfect place for family, friends, and loved ones."

Service was excellent, and overall experience was great. Wine recommendation was perfect and exactly what we wanted! Ordered : diavolo pizza (9/10), margherita pizza (9/10), garden pizza(7/10 - lots of leaves and veggies) , and special pizza of the day (veggies, no cheese, but perfect balance of flavours 9/10), Dante salad (9/10), tagliatelle (10/10). Food was amazing and would definitely recommend!!"

Street parking is available but may be in short supply depending on when you go. I didn't notice if it was metered.The place: Great space that's not too big and not too small, with a decent-sized bar near the entrance and a dining area on the opposite side. Decor is minimal but cozy - you almost feel like you're sitting in someone's kitchen!The goods: My date and I decided to skip the appetizer and share two pasta dishes (even though everyone seemed to be ordering pizza, which, by the way, looked and smelled delicious!). So, we ordered the spicy Strozzapretti and the agnelotti. The strozzapretti was served in 'nduja, buratta, citron confit and pangrattato and was fantastic! For me, it was the perfect level of spicy (actually, not that spicy at all) but my date found it very spicy (he's a wuss!). The fish was bursting with flavour and had we been given bread, I would have. sopped up every bit of remaining sauce in the dish. The agnolotti was served in a marron and espresso butter sauce that was so very unique and so very tasty. This dish had a hot of sweetness to it that my date loved. We really enjoyed both dishes, with my favouring the strozza and him favouring the agenlotti. For dessert, we went with the cannoli - these were some of the best cannoli that I've ever had, which says something, considering my family is Italian and I've had the opportunity to eat cannoli in Italy. YUM! Service: Great - super friendly individuals. Price point: I docked one star because I felt like the price is a little steep. For two mains, dessert and 2 drinks, it was $100 (excluding tip) for two people. That said the quality of the food is great - I will go back to try the pizza!Check it!"

On the plus side - coming here with a large group - you get to try lots of things, on the minus side - you probably want to order at least 2 of everything. Another notable thing here is cocktails - they're pretty good - and you'll need 'em to handle the music volume - part of the whole ""not stodgy"" branding.Another thing that was next level is their dessert. Also ask about the grappa - they have a curated collection that wont disappoint. Dont miss."

/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We were really excited to try Nora Gray's new sister restaurant! It's well located in St-Henri, not far from the metro and lots of free parking in the area. The ambiance is so nice, it's casual and not stuffy. I like that they have online reservations and you can reserve either at the bar or at tables. We ordered the asparagus and suppli Al telefono as appetizers and both were creamy and delicious! Pizza: we ordered the Diavolo (peperoni and hot peppers) and the margherita. Being of Italian origin, I'm very particular about pizza.  Elena's pizza is very authentic. The crust is thin but crunchy, there is just the right amount of sauce (so that the crust doesn't become soft) and just the right amount of toppings. The pizza really brought back great memories of my families pizza.Wine: the waitress suggested a glass of wine for each of us that would pair well with our order and she really nailed it! For dessert we ordered the hazelnut ice cream which is a generous portion for just $3 and the cannoli. The cannoli is not what I know to be a traditional cannoli so I didn't love it but this may be their spin on it.This is a really nice pizzeria!  Get a few pizza's to share and order a glass of wine and you will have a great time!"
/user_details?userid=NDpDbLel51kGekwWhdhb9Q,Natasha R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,This review is about the poor service. The food here was ok (not great--soggy pizzas but decent pasta). My friend booked our holiday dinner for 8pm for 5 pple. They set us up in an awkward round table where 4 of us were to eat at a bench on one side & the other 1 person sat o a chair facing all of us -- like a job interview. Very odd so we requested a 2nd chair& there was a fuss. We had to then ask the waiter if we could order drinks (you'd think they'd want us to order some). When the waiter came back for food order we asked for 5 more minutes and he rolled his eyes. Seriously???!!! The food arrived in rushed fashion & we had to wave our waiter down to order wine w our meal. At 9:30 we were told that if we ordered dessert we had 20 min as they had a seating at 10pm. We were not told this at time of booking & this is just bad service to spring this on folks. One friend was craving dessert and ordered one and when we asked for bills we were told the table after us had arrived so can we pay quickly. WTH???!!!!!!I used to like this restaurant. I've been 6x in past. But not again. The poor service & treatment of us + declining food quality (did I mention the soggy pizza) left a bad taste in my mouth.
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here a while back for dinner for two. Overall, the experience was positive and fun! We made a reservation and were sat pretty promptly (at the bar, which is always fun as your service is extra fast and you get to interact with the staff more). Food: we had the cauliflower as well as the roasted carrots to start which were both delicious.  For our main, we shared the pizza of the day which a potato pizza and the tagliatell - a classic. The pizza, to my surprise, was very good! I didn't know what to expect from a potato pizza but I remember it being very scrumptious. I wishh I had taken photos to share! The tagliatelle was also very simple yet phenomenal. To end the meal, we shared a cannnoli which was also good. Service: since we sat at the bar, I expected the service to be better but the bar tender was a bit snappy and short - maybe that was her personality? It wasn't much to make a huge difference in our night but it did throw me off a little bit when we were trying to pick which wine to have. (We ended up getting a bunch of different glasses of  different wines instead of a bottle and tried some cocktails as well, the cocktails were well made!) Overall: really fun, this place has a very trendy vibe with a cute yellow door. Food is good, the menu is not too pretentious or long and it's a good time. Make a reso in advance! We came in on a week day and it was still packed."
/user_details?userid=KNRwbAKYzHXjaWGQJc_pTg,Jimmy L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This Italian modern restaurant has more velvet and hipsters than a Arcade Fire music video. A beautiful restaurant that sets the table for beautiful subpar food. The menu is interesting, but food lacks that tang. Even their pizza strikes out. Elena is a spectacle for your eyes but not your mouth."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was quite busy on a fri at ten pm. We got the gnocco fritto to start based on the barmaid's recommendation. It's basically three pieces of warm, fried dough with toppings on the side. The dough was like  an unsweetened donut but in the shape of an eggroll. It's empty inside. Next to it was a meat that was similar to a thick salami and then another meat similar to prosciutto, and then marinated eggplant. It was very good. You can put all the stuff inside the dough. Then we had the diavolo pizza. It was a bit long for them to make it but it was worth the wait. The barmaid recommended the mushroom pizza and the margarita pizza but we wanted something with meat on it. The diavolo pizza has pepperoni, tomatoes, chili peppers, and mozzarella di bufala. I added spicy oil to make it even spicier. I paired it with a montepulciano d'abruzzo red wine. It was super dry but once it was aerated it was so good! Mmm i will definitely be going back! I like the vibe and the decorations. There's a white brick wall and a marble looking bar. It was very zen. ***review update ***My friends and I went on Saturday night. We ordered the diavola again because we liked it so much last time. I ordered the Jimmy Conway. It was good but I still preferred the diavola. The jimmy Conway had salsiccia, rapini and provolone. My friend had the fun guy pizza and I tried a slice. It was bland and I do not recommend it. Another friend ordered tagliatelle and he loved it. The only negative thing he had to say is that the portion was too small but he has a slice of pizza and was fine after. We all ordered coffee to stay awake because we were so tired and I totally regretted it because it was the worst coffee I've ever had. It was fruity and acidic. It was too weird for me. The Americano and espresso tasted the same. Some of us ordered the ice cream - hazelnut, pistachio and lemon. The pistachio was so good! Another friend had the canolli and he didn't like the filling because he found it tasted fruity. This is a dimly lit, loud resto good for a night out with friends or even for a date. Basically come here for the pizza and pasta. The salads looked good and the portions were huge but I didn't want to order salad on a Saturday night lol. If you really want dessert get the pistachio ice cream and do NOT get coffee!"
/user_details?userid=r_XO_oUvgrBzZdZGB_R23g,Jacob W.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Really awesome dinner at Elena. I arrived thinking I would not eat pizza. I just wasn't in the mood! But then I saw (and smelled) one of their pizzas, and I suddenly was in the mood for pizza. Funny how that works.We started with two vegetable appetizers, each of which we loved. The cauliflower has a really delicate cook to it, soft with just the smallest amount of crisp on the outside, and an intense romesco sauce that really hits you over the head (in a good way!). The radish salad, by contrast, was delicate but packed with flavor, acid and fat perfectly balanced to draw out the flavors of the thinly sliced radishes.We shared a pasta and a pizza. The spaghetti ubriachi was excellent-- it's a dish I often dislike because it can take on unpleasant scorched wine flavors in the pot. This one did no such thing, and instead married the flavors of simmered red wine, briefly melted parmigiano, chili, and olive oil with a power that deactivates the conscious mind and makes one very briefly lose one's fear of death. The asparagus pizza was also a real winner, really celebrating the flavor of the vegetable with both briefly cooked thin slices and a luxurious asparagus cream. Rich, for a dish nominally celebrating asparagus but very worth it.The wine program seems quite strong-- I had a great skin contact wine with a light sparkle to it. My only criticism is that there are very few offerings by the glass, which is a shame because I would have liked to try a few more things. It does seem on trend to basically only feature one or two wines by the glass in each category so I can't really fault them, and I did really enjoy the one I had so what am I complaining about?Go even if you aren't yet hungry for pizza. You will be."
/user_details?userid=bOl4BUQzgcZegP8yxYPEFg,Tiffy C.,"Outremont, Canada",1 star rating,"Not plant-based friendly at all, overall underwhelming experience.To start off, we had booked through an app, and received confirmation of our reservatio. However when we got there they made a big fuss about us not having a reservation (although we had done it) when a table was free and could accommodate our party.The wine selection is all ""natural"" wines, I am by no means a wine expert but all the wines tasted very vinegary and they were fermented, so slightly sparkling, it was like a super vinegary kombucha. So if you're into that you will like their wine selection, if not, you will be dissapointed like most our table was. I asked for a sparkling water twice and never got it. Appetizers were not plant based friendly, but I ordered for the green salad and asked them to hold the cheese, it was delicious : lettuce, fennel and radicchio. I ordered for the margarita pizza without mozzarella, and asked if they could replace the cheese by arugula or spinach, they said they cannot add anything on it. We asked for the mozzarella on the side so another dinner could enjoy it, they said they can't put it on the side. Not accommodating at all, I basically overpaid for bread with burnt basil leaves and tomato sauce that tasted like tomato paste out of a can. I've been to many great pizzerias, they are always very kind and accommodating and happily replace the cheese with greens. Regarding the dinners who are not plant-based, they were disappointed by the portion of the pasta dishes and underwhelmed by the pizza. Desserts were tasty, the blueberry dessert was amazing too bad the ice cream it's served with is bland. The coffee was very good.I find that $50 is overpriced for the quality of what is served.  I wouldn't come back or recommend Elena."
/user_details?userid=l-1cva9rA8_ugLrtSdKAqA,Vibhor S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This is some good pizza. I got the classic margherita and it was delicious. The only thing that I think can be better again is the dough, it being a bit more airy (this is just me being whiny and nit-picking). But everything else was great, especially the sauce to cheese to dough ratio.The service is quick and good. And the decor is very nice too, very minimalist chic (this is me trying to talk like I know shit). Would recommend this place for sure."

Get off of Yelp and go to Elena!!! My husband and I came in on a Thursday night without a reservation and were shocked to see this place packed! Luckily there were two seats at the kitchen bar area available. We were greeted by a cheerful hostess and every employee we came in contact with was super amazing. The menu was in French and my French is not super good so our waiter explained EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu to us! We chose the pasta special which was smoked squash in a brown butter sauce with fried sage. WOW!! The smoked squash flavor resembled a smoked meat. The brown butter sauce was so light and the sage was the perfect topper! Our waiter suggested a perfect red wine to go with our dinner which was so tasty. We also ordered the M. Fun-guy pizza which had champignons, céleri-rave, taleggio! Mushrooms upon mushrooms upon tasty mushrooms of all kinds. The dough is specifically milled for Elena and will blow your mind. The best pizza I have ever had. Sitting at the kitchen bar allows you to watch the kitchen work. The kitchen works like a perfect dance. For dessert we had the Affogato which is an apple donut. OMG!! It literally is half of an apple dipped in donut dough batter and fried. They top it with caramel and a HOMEMADE RUM RAISIN ice cream, a dash of salt and brown sugar crumble. HOLY COW!!! AMAZING!!!! The place feels like a bubbly, dinner party. The employees are happy and dancing and treat you like you are their only customer. Did I say EAT HERE yet?  IN LOVE!!! I'll be missing Elena while back in the U.S."

Our waitress was understanding, patient and helped us settle on our choices. We ordered exactly what she suggested and were blown away with our dishes.Food: OMG! Both my friend and I got the Fun-guy pizza w/ mushrooms, celery + taleggio. For dessert, we ordered the special, battered + fried Apple topped with Rum Raisin ice cream; it tasted like apple flavoured donuts.I would recommend and return!

Located on the west end of Notre Dame street, the location was a surprise to say the least, considering this area isn't exactly chic for a restaurant of this caliber; the sleek modern decor and retro design touches make for a very beautiful space and great laid back feel. We opted for the suppli al telefono (rice croquettes) as a starter and both loved the moist croquettes and delicious tomato sauce; the pecorino cheese added a touch of savoury to the sweetness of the dish and the execution was bang on! We ordered two pizzas for our mains including the margherita and diavolo. If you can impress with your simplest pizza then you're laughing; the crust was perfectly chewy, thin but not flimsy, so it holds those generous toppings perfectly. The pepperoni on the diavolo pizza was delicious and there was the perfect amount of heat to really give that pizza a kick, although my friend found it a little too much. The mozzarella and the sauce were perfect! I haven't had a good slice of wood oven pizza like this in a while! We ordered the cannolis and a cherry financier for dessert and both were amazing, although the cannoli with the pistachios and honey were really unique and out of this world tasty! This spot is a great addition to the strip and is definitely my go to now for a nice casual evening in a great space, good service and of course, delicious pizza."

We ordered 3 pizzas and shared amongst ourselves along with two pasta dishes. If we were to go again, we would simply get more pizzas. Btw, I wouldn't take the chance of going without making reservations in advance. The restaurant is not conveniently located by public transport, but I think it's worth it."

Our server was amazing at answering our questions and giving us some insights on our possible choices. She was great. The pizzas were incredible. We both like pizza and have tried numerous places in different cities including Montreal. The ingredients were fresh, wonderfully paired and beautifully put together.

We had a set menu organized for us, which was great as we got to sample several dishes. I was the only one who didn't eat seafood and they were able to accommodate me and brought an extra dish. The kale Caesar salad (a first for me) was absolutely delicious! We had 3 different pizzas to sample which were great - the one I wanted wasn't included...the Diavolo :( Well, now I have a reason to come back! The tagliatelle really stood out for me too. That would definitely have to be part of my next visit! Have to say the service was fantastic too. They were friendly and very accommodating and always available when needed. The restaurant itself has a nice casual atmosphere. A great place to share a meal with friends! I will be back!"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I've got some serious attitude about this place. I felt just about indignant when my partner and I left there yesterday: this place is a slap in the face to the neighbourhood and probably the strongest example of a toxic business gentrifying the neighbourhood.First of all, we walked into a nearly empty restaurant on Monday evening and were snobbed for not having a reservation by a guy in nikes and track pants. Seriously, if you're going to be a condescending jerk to us, you might as well look professional. We were told (word for word) 'we have a place for people without reservations' and were escorted out of the restaurant, through what was referred to as the 'sketchy alleyway' (not funny guys, this is my neighbourhood) into what is, admitedly, a cute concrete backyard space. In the backyard there's service at the bar and you can only order salad, pizza, and desert, which was fine with us. In the process of ordering at the bar some dude stole our table who's drunk middle-aged pal later got in our faces for no good reason. None of this is the biggest deal, but given the consistently crappy attitude of the staff it left a feeling that this place is an overall gathering space for awful people.As another reviewer mentioned, they were not accomodating to a plant-based diet, whatsoever. I generally don't like to compare with professional experience, but I worked at reputable pizza places for years (one that charges even more for the pizza!) and never was there such an issue made over having the cheese on the side. Additionally the final product without cheese is a disgrace to the establishment; as it's been commented before, it's a hot cracker with tomato paste and (literally) four leaves of basil. The second star in this review is attributable to the wine- the orange wine we tasted was divine. I'm a big fan of natural wines and clearly these guys know what they're doing on that front. That being said, each glass of wine was the same price as our mediocre pizza. Ho-hum.Dear Elena, it's thin crust pizza being served in a concrete backyard in 2018. Get over yourselves."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went with a group of 6 last Friday night and enjoyed the experience despite a few shortcomings. As advertised in other people's reviews, the table was not yet ready for our 7pm reservation. The 15 minute wait didn't kill me, but I get the impression that we got off easy this time.I had the telefono arancini appetizer. It was crispy on the outside with melted cheese inside and a delicious sauce. It was good but it didn't change my life...calm down people. For pizza, I ordered the Diavolo which is essentially a spicy pepperoni pie. It was far spicier than I anticipated, but still quite enjoyable. The outside crust is absolutely delicious, but the crust in the middle is far too thin and not nearly crispy enough to hold up to the toppings. As a result, you will have a difficult time holding up a single slice to your mouth. Even when a slice is completely folded inward, the tip will droop downwards. I'm no engineer, but surely, this can be addressed and corrected? Lord knows I've had authentic italian pizza that doesn't do this. Like most authentic italian pizza, the cheese is used sparingly. I could have used another handful of mozzarella to fill in the gaps. Charge me a few extra dollars, just give me enough cheese.The wine and cocktail list is extensive and fancy shmancy. This is after all, a Nora Gray offshoot and so 17 dollar pizzas are just the bait they use to sell you wine. Nevertheless, there are some reasonably priced bottles if you look carefully. There are a whole lot of people here for the scene. There was a lineup at the door of well to do, hyper confident, sparkly, and bedazzled young people at 10pm just as we were leaving. We might have lingered a little longer, but our waiter suggested that maybe we want to move to the bar downstairs to make room for more paying customers. Not cool or appreciated.  For some reason, they only list 5 pizzas on their menu. I would have liked more variety. Apparently they have a hawaiian pizza on certain nights as a special. This and another half dozen or so pizzas should be added to the menu permanently. I'd go again and try some different dishes next time."

The best part was the service, it was excellent. We had the kale Cesar salad, it was just ok, not that flavourful. We each had a pizza. They were just ok and very salty. The crust was underwhelming, very chewy and soft( unless you like that ). I prefer and crispy crust. The worst part was the dessert. Had a gelato sundae. The gelato had a good flavour but the texture was horrible, all ice crystals. No creaminess at all. Huge disappointment all around.We sat in the bar area that has a fabric wall hanging that has not been vacuumed probably since the day they opened.  It was pretty gross having to look at that dirty thing while you eating isn't appetizing."

I preferred the Margherita while everyone else at my table preferred their popular Mushroom pizza.As appetizers, we ordered the kale Cesar salad and the bread. Both were delicious. The only reason I elevated this place to a 5 star instead of a 4 was the AMAZING spaghetti ubriachi (cooked with red wine but the taste is very subtle). Words really cannot do justice to this perfect plate of pasta. Perfection. In fact, I urge you all to try this dish at least once. Bravo to the chef!Prices are very reasonable and service was quick and friendly. The place definitely has a hipster vibe going with its modern furniture and old school blinds.

He said it was no problem to get a seating, but he didn't mention it was for downstairs!!! Did we know??? The icing on the cake is I passed by Tuesday night to ask if a reservations had been made,the guy just said for sure she must have made it didn't want to bother to check!!

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"When I heard that the group behind Nora Gray, one of my favourite restaurants in the city, was opening a second restaurant, I got excited. When I heard that it would based around pizza AND be in St-Henri, closer to my neighbourhood in the Point, well that made me very happy indeed. For many months, we heard online about details of the upcoming space until eventually Elena opened up. Reviews were very positive to start so I found myself there for a relax Sunday date night hoping that I had found a great pizza place to enjoy.For a Sunday night, Elena was certainly busy! The space is a sparse modern vibe - lots of whites and grays. The lighting is mostly ambient and indirect - a strong similarity to Nora Gray but the size and colors of the space make Elena less intimate compared to its sister. The interesting element of the space is the serving counter in the middle of the room used for alcohol, olive oils, salt, pepper, wine glasses, etc. It adds a interestingly retro element but the modern style of the table fits the look they have going.The menu is small but covers more than just pizza. There are also some salads, some entrees, some meats and pasta options to enjoy! We decided to start with a plate of Gnocco fritto - basically fried pizza dough puffs served with housemade red wine sausage, mortadella, soppressata and marinated eggplant. I found the soft pillowy texture of the fried dough nice but the real treat of this dish is the homemade charcuterie. Nice and rich across the board - I was a big fan of sopressata and the sausage.For mains, we had a desire for pizza so we stuck to pizza. My fiancé went with the margherita - tomatos, basil and mozza di bufala. I went with the Bianco - potato, pancetta, onions and kénogami cheese. Elena does Napoletana-style pizza - the dough is lightly chewy, the crust barely charred and pillowy. There is no crunch to the bottom. The pizza requires you to fold it because it will not hold on its own. Based on that style, Elena nails the dough - if you are expecting a crispy base, you will not get that here. I enjoyed the chewy pillowy texture immensely.However, we both had issues regarding the topping on our pizza. For the margherita, my fiancé found the tomato 'sauce' very thin and watery. It felt like the pizza should have had more tomatoes than it did and thus the balance between the cheese and tomatoes felt off. In my case, I liked the flavour of the Bianco but I also felt like there is a lack of the quantity of the toppings. When I compared to other Napoletana-style pizzas places in the city, I feel like I got more toppings on the pizza than this. It is a subtle thing but we both left feeling slightly disappointed in our pizzas. I love Nora Gray so this visit was a bit of a letdown for me personally. It was fine but given how highly I rate Nora Gray, fine is not what I was expecting from their pizza. I am now very interesting in seeing what I get while in Naples this summer on our next trip because I wonder how close Elena is to traditional pizzas and how what I have had locally impacted my enjoyment of their pizza. Pizza can be a very personal experiment so I'm sure Elena's pie will satisfy many but for the moment, it is not my preference.Cheers!"

I was a bit thrown off by the location (a bit far from other well know restaurants in St Henri) but the restaurant is beautiful and a great size (even for groups). The food was also really good. The kale Cesar salad was fantastic and the seafood salad was perfectly balanced in terms of flavour. The pizza was ok but I found the sauce a bit sweet for my liking and the I also tend to like my pizza slightly more cooked. Plan on going back. Totally recommend it to others

/user_details?userid=J35hslTy0-tedmqxrOflzQ,Caroline C.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,My sister and I joined my dad for dinner at Elena over the holidays - the restaurant was booked pretty full and changing the reservation from two to three meant we had to sit at the bar - which turned out to be a great thing. The service was so so so good. Vero talked us through the whole menu and made sure we selected the proper bottle of wine for our party. She was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. The food was so good - we shared a shrimp salad (was a special) and the Diavolo and mushroom pizzas. It was the perfect amount of food. I cannot recommend this place enough. Will definitely come again next time I'm in town.

Delicious new addition to the neighborhood of St-Henri.I had ordered the gnocco fritto as my appetizer and the margherita pizza as my main. Best thin crust pizza I have had to date.I will definitely be returning in the near future.I highly recommend to book a reservation online before heading there."
/user_details?userid=y7nGHxsj7kQ1WUlCveO_Pw,Rafic K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Elena, no matter where in the city you are coming from its well worth the trek to St.Henry! Tucked in between apartments (in a mostly residential neighbourhood) it would be a little hard to find if it weren't for the stylish, eager dinners waiting outside to wolf down naturally levied wood fired pizza! reserve a spot in the contemporary dinning room, or try your luck around back in the dreamy, intimate  patio. Its small and you seat your self, making it a bit more casual then its counterpart up front. Snag a seat at the bar like we did and chat the night away with the fun and knowledgeable waitstaff. Serving up a classic margarita covered in mozzarella di buffalo and funky house specialities like the Mr. Fun-guy, a white pizza with a celeriac ricotta, covered in mushrooms! The real draw, at least for me is Elenas extensive, perfectly curated natural wine list. Its sure to satisfy the beginner wino and expert wine drinkers alike. Dont be intimidated by some of the obscure varietals or wine makers. The staff is uber knowledgeable and more then happy to help you navigate the small but delightful list of white, red, orange, and sparkling. Great staff, well made food, beautiful ambiance, delectable wine list! This place is a gem! P.s they are a coffee shop during the day! Be sure to check it out."

Dare I say it was actually our favorite place from the entire trip. I would highly recommend. Food was excellent and flavorful, the wine selection is robust, and the service is top notch. Worth the trip and every cent. Will definitely be back."

/user_details?userid=2G09bHKMvfiBhTR8theOyA,Sanaya S.,"Bay Harbor Islands, FL",5 star rating,Incredible natural wine selection. They're served in large bottles that gives a fun side to the experience. The Kale Caesar is absolutely delicious. Always fun to try their seasonal pizza but something to be said about the simplicity in the tagliatelle ragu. Deliciously simple. Staff was so helpful and kind. Cute place and has quickly become one of my Montreal favourites.

Food is amazing, wine list is great (could use a few more options by the glass but what they do have is very good) and the service is awesome. Ambiance and décor are also amazing. This place will definitely become a hot spot quickly. A must try!"
/user_details?userid=aJ1ivlkGDeIC_1cCP7BcHA,Eric L.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there last night. On Notre Dame but West of De Courcelles in an area without many new restaurants (for now), which makes it quite easy to park. Decor and vibe very cool. Food was excellent, had the Kale salad (simple but really really good), Margherita pizza which was great (think Bottega but a bit thinner), pastas were very solid and tasty (medium in size). Also had the Dorado which was very tasty but would have been nicer if deboned and served by the wait staff. Service was friendly and efficient. The only negative (and the reason for not giving it 5 stars) was the music, quite loud (and I don't mind loud) but didn't love the playlist....some sort of techno-disco-funk type music. Check this place out."

Was also schooled by the waitress on how Apérol spritz isn't an Italian cocktail but a French cocktail... seriously disappointing"
