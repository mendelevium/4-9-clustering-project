We had the fish and chip which comes with 2 pieces of fried fish, homemade fries, coleslaw and homemade tartare sauce.You can also get half portions which is the same but with only 1 piece of fish.The fish was so crispy and light. Even after spraying it with a large quantity of lemon it was still crispy. The batter smelled fresh (not like old oil that is reused), the coleslaw was not too sour and the tartare sauce had onions cut in tiny pieces so that you have a crunch at each bite.We went at and odd hour 4:30 so there was not many people but half the tables were already reserved.  So if you plan on going for supper i would suggest to reserve or you will probably have to wait in line."

We kinda went overboard with the huge platter before the actual f&c but glad we tasted it all. The best part of all they had Alcohol Free Glutenberg which made my day because I'm pregnant and made me feel "" normal "" in all sense of the word. I definitely recommend this place!! Looking forward to go back, actually tempting myself to do so tonight #GF #Fish&Chip"

When we arrived the two ladies were in the middle of a discussion but invited us to have a seat. The weather was nice, so we wanted to be seated at the window. Then, one of them brought us the menu, with no smile nor hi ... nothing.She came back a few moments later and then asked us dryly if we were ready to order, I ordered mussels with fries and fish & chips for my son. We were served relatively quickly, the mussels were really good and the proportions were more than generous. My son was also pleased with his dish. However, during all the time we were there not once, she came to ask us if everything was okay, something that she actually did with the other tables. I then asked her for desserts because my son wanted something sweet, she had this annoyed attitude, so much that my 7-year-old, finally told me that he did not want anything and we left.if the energy put in the food was the same used for welcoming clients, well I would have unhesitatingly put five stars to that place."
