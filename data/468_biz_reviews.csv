Hidden in the old montreal, it has a very welcoming and convivial vibe. Leo Iacono, the owner is as friendly as one can be and it feels like he knows everything and everybody. Uncomplicated and great would be the beat way to describe this restaurant.The luch started with some pasta because what's more italian than pasta? Nothing. Extremely tasty. Main course was a huge 25 days aged bistecca with a peppercorn sauce. It was cooked perfectly, juicy, tender and filled with taste. Also an italian classic, dessert was a biscotti and cannoli. I finished my plate and my neighbor's. I could've eated a whole batch because it was so good!There's also a huge and great selection of italian wines, I've also spotted some amazing grappa if you like that."

Truffle linguine and Barolo infused pasta both delicious and outstandingMaitre'D was attending to other guests when we left. I paid it no thought until he chased us down on the street to thank us for our business and wish us a good trip.  This is the kind of extra effort and gratitude that makes a restaurant memorable.  Thanks for a fine dinner
