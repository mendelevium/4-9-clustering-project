/user_details?userid=BAF1ZKlIqXAAY_DQGMtoIA,Farrah K.,"Kingston, Canada",5 star rating,"A must for anyone looking for a fantastic Japanese spot in Montreal.I was able to get a reservation for a Friday night for 2 at 8:30pm pretty easily. We called beforehand, indicating we wanted a patio seat (COVID-19). The restaurant doesn't take patio reservations, but told us we'd likely get a seat on the patio at that time - we did, with less than a 5 min wait.The food here is AMAZING. I was beyond pleasantly surprised.Between 2 of us, we split 4 items (along with a side of rice) 1) The salmon tartare is a HUGE must. Initially, it seemed like a small portion but totally worth it, and probably the best salmon dish I've ever had.2) The beef short ribs were also very good, and was a decently sized portion. I'm not a huge beef eater, but enjoyed how these ribs were cooked and seasoned. 3) Octopus balls - this appetizer-type item was decently sized, and very soft (almost tasted like cheese - in a good way).4) The Edamame was another must. Edamame is usually pretty standard, but I could not stop eating it because of the unique seasoning used - definitely worth the $4-5.Aside from the 9.5/10 food, the ambience was absolutely great. The patio is gorgeous, cozy, and has terrific music. For a bit of a nicer/fancier dinner, this is a 10/10 spot. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=UiU_yqwSQwTZdw3vxD_Aag,Helene M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We decided to try out this restaurant which was on our to-try list for a while, and we were not disappointed! First of all the place, decor and terrasse was awesome! We sat on the terrasse right at dawn and the ambiance was perfect...wooden tables, lanterns, big mural of a sumo right on the facade when you go out + big kudos for the choice of music with soul and loungy sounds which was a perfect fit for a relaxed tuesday evening. The food was very good, a bit on the pricey side for the quantities served but delicious. The service was impeccable. Will definitely return!"
/user_details?userid=nyl_1VcRIAyI55bb_scpdw,Mary T.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"On my final full day in Montreal, I had dinner at Biiru. It is roughly a seven-minute walk from the hotel.It was open for dinner at 5:30 pm on a Wednesday night. I got there at 5:40 pm and it was buzzing with activity.Since it was just myself, I landed a spot at the bar. It is a plus if you are a lone diner. Otherwise, you need to wait a bit if you are a larger party.The eatery has a patio area. I was perfectly happy inside, cooling off.A nice guy at the bar served me during my time at this eatery. I got a Diet Coke and pork gyoza to start.On the menu, it had ramen in soup. However, in the summertime, it's not available. Instead, I got the ramen sarada. It is essentially cold ramen noodles, with ground cherries, cucumber, shiso, cilantro, sriracha peas, nori, and a ginger vinaigrette on all of it.The pork gyoza came first. They were nicely pan-fried. It had a slight spicy kick to them. I loved the scallions. The filling was yummy. I loved them all.My ramen sarada was next. It was my first time having cold ramen. It worked nicely. There was so much flavour in this dish. It was spicy. The textures were different and cool. The ground cherries made this dish pop. The ginger vinaigrette was subtle. I appreciate that it was, as I am not a huge fan of strong ginger.I wanted dessert and got the matcha cake with passion fruit mousse. It was so good! The matcha cake were in cubes. There were crunchy bits under the cubes, which added a nice contrast. The matcha had the right balance of flavour. OMG, the passion fruit mousse was amazing! It was bright and not all that sweet. I loved how creative this dessert was.The washroom is a single stall for women. It is a bit cramped, but was clean.I had a nice experience here. The food was amazing. The ambiance is nice and relaxing, with candles on each table. The artwork is a bit quirky. I'd come back. (323)"

I went like 7 times and will always go whenever i have the chance !  My favorite is the Water melon salad, the sauce of it makes you want more! The interior design is really cozy and nice!"
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This a 4.5 star review. This Japanese tapas gem has been on my restaurant bucket list for quite some time and I was very pleased with my experience. I had the beef brochette, the ramen noodles and their poke bowl. All excellent and would definitely order it again among all the other great items on their menu. If you haven't been, do check it out!"
/user_details?userid=1CmhdHhJHokf2mkemRiY3g,Stephy S.,"Holmdel, NJ",4 star rating,"A nice little cozy restaurant in Montreal. We sat at the bar since it was crowded during lunch. I got the karaage caviar dish (fried chicken over rice). The chicken was very nicely cooked and seasoned, over a seasoned bowl of rice. Our bartender/waiter was nice and not too attentive, but my glass of water was always filled. Fun vibe in the restaurant. I'd recommend."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a really cute spot with great ambiance!! The food is excellent and fairly priced. We ordered several things for the table to share and everything was absolutely delicious!! We loved the food so much, we ended up ordering an entire second round to eat! Didn't get to photograph that but everyone was very satisfied. The servers are friendly and accommodating. Will definitely make a trip to this spot again!"
/user_details?userid=CMEAQHjrRps7OMjVZQARFw,Tyler A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"We came here on a Friday after work and sat at the terrasse in back. The space felt very trendy and was filled mostly with a younger crowd. We ordered five plates to share for both of us and we left feeling satisfied, but not stuffed. The mushroom okonomiyaki was the highlight of all the dishes we tried with the Chirashi 2.0 coming in a close second place. The Totoro cocktail was strong and reminded me of a drink you might get at a tiki bar.Overall I would definitely recommend this place. I couldn't find anything to complain about; the service was great, the food and drinks were delicious and it had a neat atmosphere. I'll definitely be going back!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"I've only visited Biirū once, for about 45 minutes at lunchtime. In the short time frame that I was there, they made a lasting impression. I can say confidently, that the food, service, price and location are great!From their lunch menu, I ordered the Salmon Tartare served with rice and Nori, and it was absolutely amazing! The tartare was perfectly seasoned and packed with flavour. The portion was ideal for lunchtime - not too little, not too much; it was just right. Also, everything on their menu was super affordable. The salmon tartare dish was 13.95. In my opinion, it's a steal for the quality and quantity of food that you receive!When I visited, the restaurant was quite busy. I believe the person that served me was the owner. He greeted me warmly and was very attentive throughout my time there. I appreciated how often he visited my table to check in and ensure that I was enjoying my meal.The decor is very modern and hipster-like. The restaurant is very small and intimate, so I'd strongly advise making reservations. I spotted a decent sized terrace, that I imagine will open as soon as the weather permits. I'm excited to return to try a few other dishes on their menu!"
/user_details?userid=79PMejA4-xLHlYWPIxAZfw,Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",3 star rating,"Food ranged from decent to tasty, but service wasn't the best. We were super excited to try Japanese cuisine in a French City especially because of all the amazing reviews I read. We arrived post the normal dinner time so got lucky with a table. I tried calling several times to make reservations but no one picked up the call. I got the abakado and thought the drink was ok. We ordered tartare, poke bowl and pork ribs and they all were delicious, especially the ribs was very flavorful. We finally ended with a matcha cake which was stale and tasted weird.I would say the food was around 3.5 but the service was really 2. Our server attended us just a few times throughout the night and we had to tell her several times to get us silverware. So we waited until the food cold cold. There were several other larger groups that night who were having shots and our sever was having multiple shots with them. Though it was great to see a fun ambience where you enjoy while you work, it was rather tiresome to ask the server several times for utensils and wait for the food to turn cold to start eating."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decided to come back here after falling in love with the tarutaru, but was disappointed. It tasted different and the spiciness and herbs were overpowering the salmon taste. We also tried the haru karaage to share. The chicken was lukewarm and it felt like it has been kept on the side for a while instead of being freshly made. Don't think I would come back for now."
/user_details?userid=7sBZaqo57glRsFlWwuXnaA,Kimberley K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3 star rating,FUN place.  Lots of action. IZAKAYA.  The food is not the best.   Good but not Great.  The beef is chewy and I had to spit out a lot of it.  Stick with the tartare and potstickers.
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I've been here once a while back with a girlfriend for lunch. Great service. We sat on the outside patio which was nice and cozy. The tables are a little too close together but it was fine as we were one of the only ones there. Food was great overall and fairly priced. I would come back to try other things on the menu next time.
/user_details?userid=A5UmPoM48Y8NOzMg7gjPuw,Natacha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly one of my favourite Japanese spots! It's always packed, their menu is straight forward and you can tru multiple things on the menu. I've been 3 times and they just never disappoint. The service is great and I love that the waiters know the menu. The food is soooooooo delicious. Their spicy salmon tartare is probably my all time favourite. It has rice krispy flakes on top of the rice, its the perfect amount of crispy and spicy. Also their ramen is top notch. I've been to solid ramen places that don't have a broth this good. I've almost tried the whole menu and I promise you you won't be disappointed. Only thing is that their restaurant has two seatings and they fill up quickly so you need a reservation. Also for dessert you NEED to try the passion fruit matcha dessert, it's life changing"
/user_details?userid=7RLTlbjC8uDySlVkoqFiYA,Patience S.,"Morristown, NJ",5 star rating,"Two years later, Biirū is every bit as good as we remembered. (Also as loud, but it's worth it.)The Ramen salad with wakame crunchies, sriracha chickpeas was to die for. The Chicken karaage was excellent. Both of these were so good we ordered second rounds. I loved the suika 2.0 with pepper and shiso. The salmon bonbons were tender and the salmon sashimi very fruity and fresh.A number of cocktails were ordered.  Raijin got a second round. I had the Kitsune, and while I did not dislike it, I would neither recommend nor ever order it again. ^_^The food is exceptional. Absolutely worth a visit."
/user_details?userid=1sRA2M40gvdteexhL5Xknw,Cindy T.,"Westminster, CA",3 star rating,"Drinks were good! Service was great! Food, I would have to say it's a 3.5 stars as I've had more tasting Japanese dishes elsewhere. The decor is unique and nice, that I must say. Price is little higher then the norm for what they are offering. I would come back to try their yakitori dishes if available."
/user_details?userid=Z9HuJXXZw3Cc7d--29Yzng,Bonnie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5/5Food is good but not wow. I took dishes to share with my boyfriend but they werent satisfying and honestly it's not worth it. The beef tataki tasted only the sauce and with a lot of veggies which I find not compatible. Also, I took skewers with bacon ( something called mochi) but it tasted like ricecake. Not gonna lie but their menu has a lot of interesting food, the way they describe their plates is very chic-like it makes me wanna try everything. Portions are small, not a place for tappas. I had a very nice experience there, So you should definitely give it a try. although the food was so-so the place/deco is very original. It's a nice place for a date. I went on the terrasse because they didn't have a/c inside and their terrasse is very cute. Service is excellent, they filled my water right the second i was done drinking my water. The bill came right away after being asked so the service is impeccable compared to many places."
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,Amazing service all night and we were quickly seated even though we came in on a Friday Night on Poutine Week. Great music and venue. I loved the decorations in the place. The food was price amazing and the portions were large for the amount. The Japanese style poutine was out of this world. As well their Godzilla Brownie too ! It was great I went with many friends so we split different items and shared. It ended up being a cheap night. The only downfall I do not understand which bathroom was for women and which was for men. I also highly recommend the sake bomb as you do it with friends and enjoy the night. They get you to count on Japanese to three and pound your fist on the table to make the shot drop in the glass.

/user_details?userid=4C2LycW0izAjm4UEtvIgcA,Rich H.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Nice atmosphere, friendly/helpful waiters, lousy food.  Biiru is a fantasy of Japan by/for people who have no idea about quality Japanese food.  Chirashi, normally sashimi on a bed of fresh sushi rice, was nothing of the sort.  It was a salad of several-day-old bits of fish/cucumber salad on low quality rice (tasted similar to Uncle Ben's).  The fish was hacked in to small scraps.  Eel yakitori was slightly better but it was covered with way to much of a sticky, sweet sauce (La Choy ingredients?).  Okonomiyaki was somewhat more authentic, but it was finished with a dump of some dry, green spice that is never used in Japan or by authentic places outside Japan.  Sake was of reasonable quality for the price.  The high ratings for this place make me wonder whether there is quality, FRESH sashimi in Montreal, prepared by adequately trained chefs.  Avoid."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Service was quite bad on Friday evening even though the food was good. The staff tries too hard to kick people out of the restaurant so that more guests can get a table, but the way how they do it is just wrong: they literally pulled my dish away from the table even though I am not done with my food, that was really rude.We ordered the salmon sashimi (my fav), the mushroom pancake, the tuna poke, the beef tataki and the octopus balls, all of them are quite amazing. I would recommend people to avoid going there on Friday or weekend because it is crazily packed and the waiters are really not nice and patient, but at least the food is not bad."

My daughter and I shared several different dishes and all were wonderful- great variety of flavors and styles, from fried chicken to ramen. My favorite was the salmon sashimi while she raves about the ramen. Delightful spot."

I don't eat seafood or fish so I ordered my own dishes and everyone else shared many plates. The rest of my group really enjoyed their food. I ended up getting Ramen Sarada, Haru Karaage, and some Yakitori skewers. I have to say I loved everything I ate. Nice choices on the drink side too. Definitely a trendy atmosphere. Overall, a fun night out."

Seems like a fun place to hang out and have a couple cocktails and go on the patio. The service was good, but I would definitely not suggest getting the ribs, they were rubbery but everything else was delicious. Definitely try the mushroom and beef to talkie that was excellent!"
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A really nice place for Japanese tapas. The portions are small, we were 2 people and we ordered three tapas and deserts. The pork ribs were delicious. The chicken fry with scallion were also very good. We also had the corn, with coconut and lime. For me, the flavours did not work out. We had maltesers brownie for deserts which was not good. The brownie did not taste fresh."
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've never really been adventurous enough to stop and eat at a restaurant without first researching it extensively on the web, but last night, I'm glad we did. After setting out to go to two separate Japanese restaurants and finding that they both weren't accepting any more clients, we were discouraged enough to go home, heat up some leftovers, and call it a night. However, on the way back, I looked up and saw some bright lanterns swinging above a patio - from there, we decided to reroute to biiru. When we entered the restaurant, every table was full except one in the corner, conveniently a table for two. The outside deck was closed for the night (not sure why), which was a bit disappointing at first, but the immediately apparent trendy interior made up for it. Later, I found that even the washroom was cool. Ultimately, the decoration could be summed up as a mix of traditional and classic Japanese gaming culture. Key features included a huge wall mural, pac man neon wall pieces, and a neon lucky cat sign.  The service was pretty good considering how packed they were, and we ended up ordering 10-15 minutes after we first sat down. We got karaage; two plates of two skewers each, one of grilled eel and one of chicken thighs; and two house specials, shoyu ramen and the mushroom okonomiyaki. I didn't manage to get a picture of everything we ordered before we ate it all, but my favourites were the eel and okonomiyaki. Personally, I wouldn't order the ramen again as I wasn't a big fan of the pulled pork in the ramen and the flavour of the broth.I can't believe I've never heard about this place before - I'll definitely be coming back soon!"
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Very enjoyable place but not authentic. More like Americanised Japanese food but the taste is great. The portions are small finger food style and range from $9-$14.We took fried chicken with onion sauce ($9), great batter and tasted superb. The short ribs (~$12) were also delicious and very tender. We also took Salmon Candied ($9) which was warm and cooked to perfection. Their serving speed is really fast, food comes alnosti instantaneously.Try their cocktails, mostly original recipes so you won't get them anywhere else. We tried Abacado (or something like that) which was an avocado blended cocktail, had mild spice tones but a great drink in my opinion. A cooler drink was the Oseno (or something like that) which had a blend of asian fruits (kiwi, guava and the likes). Enjoyed both the drinks.It's better to make reservations beforehand.All in all, great place but not a Japanese place. More like an American shack with japanese themes."
/user_details?userid=0_6zmGnyHQrls5sJdKqudQ,Brietta Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Our bridal party was passing by in the area and quickly Yelped and found this spot. We were seated outside and I loved the decor, which depicted Japanese sumos and other characters along the walls. The ribs I got were extremely flavorful and needed rice to accompany it, while the ramen a friend ordered was extremely bland. The age tofu app was more sweet than I liked but I did like the fried chicken app and the drinks were all very unique and really good as well. I'd recommend this spot for drinks in the outdoor seating area to have with some snacks but would skip the food."
/user_details?userid=FK6QC2bpIcAIwPQ5MGxPFg,Alice X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Please try the okonomiyaki if you like truffle!!! You can definitely taste the truffle flavour there. The pork ribs weren't as flavourful as I thought it would be, but they were very tender. We also ordered the salmon tarte, which is a pretty small portion in my opinion. My friend really liked it, I personally hate the strong ginger flavour so was not my favourite. Overall I really recommend the mushroom okonomiyaki. This is so far the only restaurant I've tried in Montreal where you find more cabbage than flour batter in okonomiyaki."
/user_details?userid=iluSlybvDwAQuZStj3G42Q,Talha B.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,Holy moly! This place is bomb. Stopped in alone on a Tuesday night dinner as I just got in to Montreal. The spicy salmon tartare and the mushroom pancake are phenomenal. The mushroom pancake is super interesting and has thinly sliced truffle that moves and dances around. Loved every bit.
/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"I had high expectations coming here. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were hit and miss. I was excited to see agadashi tofu on the menu but when it arrived it was very bland. The fried chicken was just ok. Not very juicy, just a step up from frozen chicken fingers. The drinks were delicious.  With the selection of upscale restaurants we have in the city it'll be a while before I come back here."

You have to try the raw beef, which is served with pickled carrots and mushrooms, yummy! The atmosphere is very lively, but could be on the noisy side in someone's opinion. It's a great place for young professionals to hang out"
/user_details?userid=a-EHG6o5P2RtgSitnesCKA,Lau B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is great, lots of different things to taste, the ambiance is relaxed and cool, but it's very busy and cramped all the time, make sure you make a reservation if you don't want to be rushed. The service there is extremely fast, I've been to many tapas style restaurants and the Biiru is just surprisingly quick, and I ate there on 3 different occasions on a busy Friday/Saturday night. If you're looking to eat authentic Japanese cuisine, this is not the place for you, it's more of a modern Japanese inspired restaurant with a twist on most recipes. It's on the pricy side if you want the full experience I suggest tasting a lot of different things, what they can do is serve you good up to a certain amount of money per person, let's say 25 per person or more depending on your budget, they can choose for you if you're more of an adventurous eater. Very cool place."

It was a Sunday at 4:30pm. Before going home my wife asked me for a decent Asian restaurant. I opened Yelp and found this good reviewed Japanese restaurant opening at 5pm. So I decided to drive to there, fighting against the many roadworks on St Catherine. We managed to park close, but the restaurant was closed, chairs on the table, no opening hour on the door. What happened? I came back home, our stomachs empty."

/user_details?userid=aehLkadQqOZ4-xX2d0g0aQ,Deasy N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is definitely one of my favourite izakayas in MTL. I really enjoyed the lively ambiance, cool decor, the terrace, and of course the food and the drinks! The waiters were so helpful and they know the menu well. Some days they don't take reservations, but of course it's always good to call and check. Sit in the terrace if you can. I had the pork ribs, which was probably one of the most famous dishes there, and they were delicious. The meet fell off the bones and the sauce made me lick my fingers (which I don't normally do, lol). The sweetness of the ribs paired well with my other dish, the salmon tartar, which was a bit on the spicy side. I absolutely loved the salmon tartar - it's delicious and fresh. It was on a bed of rice surrounded by small crunchy crispies and seaweed leaves. I tried the brownie dessert, but I wasn't too crazy about it. They only had 2 choices on the dessert section. I think I would skip the dessert in this place. Lastly, the drink: I had the Abocado. Avocado cocktail? Yummy, light and refreshing, like nothing I've tried before (in a good way). Unlike many cocktails (which can taste similar to other cocktails), Abokado is new to my tongue and I loved it! I will return to try more items!"

/user_details?userid=bCLqNCdhUdsmTj9Braespg,Ruby Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Man, this place is so cool (but expensive)!!! It would be awesome to come back for celebratory drinks or quick tapas before heading off to an event. The atmosphere is lively and you can hear a mix of English and French (if you strained your ears to decipher the hodgepodge mess of words, of course).You get seated quickly if you come earlier during the night, and the tables are all cramped together. You get a water jug of water but when you run out they don't refill it, which is unfortunate because I drink a crazy amount. For two people the waiters recommended us on getting 4-6 tapas, so we got a mix of fried and raw dishes!The dishes are definitely Asian-style food with a twist. To be honest a lot of non-Asians frequent this place as opposed to Asians, so it's less authentic food but definitely super trendy and also delicious. The average cost for each dish would be ~$10, but it does fill you up when you finish the meal.Biirū is a casual but modern restaurant that is great for pre- or post- party. You should definitely come by when you're feeling for an interesting new take on Asian food!"

My girlfriend and I came from philly and went to stop here for drinks after dinner on our first night in town. Went in and asked the hostess for two bar seats, as she was getting it ready another hostess approached us and asked what we needed. When we said we were looking to sit at the bar she said ""well we are closing in about 15 minutes so.."" suggesting to us that it isn't worth staying. It was 930 at the time so I'm sure they didn't close at 945.. especially when online it says they close at 11, we left anyway since we were not welcome. Clearly this spot is not friendly towards Americans, disappointing to still see people judging and refusing service based on nationality. If you're an American... go elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=GxdCcMYn13DSzwEPqs8Kag,Kiran S.,"Milpitas, CA",5 star rating,"We were a group of two wanting to try out Japanese on our trip to Montreal. We called the hotel ahead to confirm that they had vegetarian options before we headed over. They said yes and we walked over to the restaurant (we were staying in a hotel that was a few blocks away).We were greeted immediately and were given a choice to either sit inside or outside (it is a small section that does have a roof). We decided that we preferred the outside section and we were seated immediately. The hostess was very helpful and since this was our first time, he walked us through the drinks and food menu. We went for the sweet sake and for food we ordered a tomato salad, seaweed salad, Japanese veggie ravioli, fried tofu and mushroom pancakes. With the exception of the burnt taste of wild mushrooms on the pancakes (more a personal preference), the food was wonderful. Also, they are all small plates, so while it seems that we ordered a lot, the amount was perfect.Also, the group that was seated outside in the order tables were all speaking to each other. They were all about to partake in a few rounds of a sake bomb. For those who don't know about it (we didn't at that time), you balance a sake shot glass on two chopsticks that have been placed on a beer glass. You are supposed to shout out inchi ni sam, sake bomb and bang the table. This makes the shot glass fall into the beer glass and then you drink the mixture immediately. We decided, what the heck, lets have some fun !! So there we were, our meal completely forgotten, doing sake bomb and listening to drinking songs of Quebec. Also, I loved the spirit of Montreal that day. The folks there, who seemed to be locals, understood that we were not from around and asked us where we were from. When we said that we were from California, they started singing ""Hotel California"" and welcomed us with such beauty. That was a night of good food, great company and group sake bombs !!Also, as we paid our bill and were walking back to the hotel, we realized that the restaurant had not charged us for the sake bombs. We rushed back to pay for them. When we explained to them that they had forgotten to charge us, they were really nice and shooed us away saying that it was on the house !!"

The service was a bit slow, but the wait staff was nice and made very good recommendations. A bit crowded, there was some confusion as to whether or not we could reserve ahead (their website said they don't take reservations for less than 6 people) but we were seated immediately and overall had a pleasant experience. TL;DR: we left full and tipsy. So it was a good evening. I'd go back."

Everything you order is to share.We had beef tataki, a little spicy but delicious, salmons bonbons, that's salmon with a sweet soya sauce, ramen salad, a cold dishes with vegetables, mushroom okonomiyaki, the portion is big but it's good and mochi wrapped with bacon, to describe, it's rice cakes with a spicy sauce served with skewers.For two people, the total amount was $60. I don't think that the service was slow, actually, it was quite fast.  Nevertheless, it's quite hard to make a reservation as you need to have a party of at least 6.I would definitely go back, maybe with more people to try their other dishes, they've recommended me to order pork ribs but I have not tried yet."

They had a ramen poutine and it was so-so.  It had the ramen elements minus the ramen. If they played it better they could've gotten a 5 star from me but they used hash brown mini taters as the fries base. Perhaps they could've used thinly shredded potatoes to simulate ramen noodles and would've made it a more balanced dish. Otherwise their standard fare is pretty good and consistent--I've been there on 3 separate occasions.  A couple of the wait staff make me think trendy, hipster and they totally rock. It's a fun place to chill after work, I've yet to try sitting outside in their terrace in the summer!"

Initially it annoyed me how difficult it was to get a reservation here (we were finally able to book a table a week in advance and then 2hs before we got a call saying there were no tables and we would have to sit at the bar - which we accepted), but that didn't get in the way of enjoying how GREAT it was! It's mainly a small plates restaurant, so for 2 people you could order like 4 or 5 dishes and share. Every single one was AMAZING, creative, original and absolutely delicious! The cheese gyozas were to die for and I strongly recommend the signature dishes, both are amazing. Great cocktails as well! Hopefully it will get easier to find a table here as time goes by.....I definitely want to come back, but I'm not the type to wait in line for hours....."

To clear things up, Biiru isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant, it's more of a ""fusion"" restaurant with a Japanese influence.I didn't know I had to make a reservation in order to get a table, but the hostess sat us at the bar since all the tables were booked for the night. Flying in from California, I wasn't able to call and place a reservation so sitting at the bar was totally fine. After a couple minutes of looking at the menu, the bartender Alexander helped us choose the first couple of dishes and drinks. He was extremely helpful and my mom and I ordered the chicken thigh yakitori, beef and cheese yakitori, gyoza, and two cocktails for starter. The gyoza came out first and was very good! The chicken thigh yakitori was so tasty; the chicken was grilled perfectly and the sauce was delicious! The beef and cheese yakitori, on the other hand, was okay. We then ordered more chicken thighs and a bowl of sashimi (forgot what it was called).As much as I loved the chicken thigh yakitori, I think I loved the drinks more. Since my mom and I sat at the bar, we watched Alexander make all the drinks in front of us. My mom ordered the Onsen while I ordered the Daruma and we both loved the drinks!! If you're looking for something refreshing, go for the Onsen! The Daruma (my personal favorite) had a very fragrant spice in the cocktail which I found very enjoyable!"

/user_details?userid=d9HEG7j_BBpyONGMaHsAJg,Vana C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I booked this restaurant as a plan B since Imadake was fully booked for Saturday. I must say our group of 10ppl were not disappointed. This izayaka is a gem, tucked away in the corner street and all you see is a Japanese flag glowing. Decor is super edgy and artistic, nice ambience, tint more trendy than a bar. I just wish the music was a bit more toned down, I wanted to hear the waitress and the buzzing sounds of ppl chatting. My Meal review: 1. Pork ribs - Omg mouth watering! Fall off the bone goodness, hint of sweetness where it's not overly done. 4.5/5 2. Bowl Chirashi Zushi - I was in heaven! Nice pieces of butter like salmon, nice flavors with the pickled cucumbers! Yum! I keep dreaming of it. 4.5/5 3. Yakitori - baby octopus, I was excited about this one because I'm such a seafood lover. This one I wasn't sure, I think the marinade might have made it to jelly like. I was expecting more of a char to the tentacles. Still very tasty. It was 3/5. I would have liked to see grilled squid instead! 4. Beef short ribs - I have a thing for fat and a bit if cartilage. This delicious meat was smoky and sweet. 4.5/5 5. Cheese ravioli - meh. Not my favorite. 1/5 6. Fried chicken - ohhhh crispy goodness!! Recommend you get this. Lightly battered. 4/5 That's my thoughts on the food. Oh FYI the drinks are very good! we agreed the food was an overall 4/5. I wish they had a bit more options with grilled food! That's what I want to eat with a beer. Overall I would totally go back :) Vana"

Yes.. the Biiru workers are not obligated​ to teach but still.. if the customer is eating like ""oddly"" shouldn't they help? I understand the worker's side too but some other places they do help customers if they see them eat... oddly... almost half of my visit I spotted​ ppl eating ""oddly""... Overall...

The servers are really helpful and polite (and also cute), and I always try a different thing when I come here and end up being satisfied with my order. The calamari, watermelon and caviar salad, and sashimi are some of my favourites there. All fresh and delish! Also it's in a great area in Montreal! You're surrounded by other great restaurants if you can't make it in there (Escondite, Jatoba) and its just a walk away from both old port and uptown.

Not sure if they are Imadake competitors or owned by the same person, but this place was awesome (maybe more awesome than Imadake even....).Service was hands down, the FASTEST I've ever seen in the city (5 dishes out in less than 7 minutes!!!), and done with big smiles and good overall energy.We decided to go for a few dishes so that we could sample everything and ended up with the following:1. Salmon sashimi on watermelon - disappointing. Salmon tasted not fresh and didn't really work with the watermelon. 2/52. Fried chicken with black pepper mayo - pretty good..not too much breading and good portion size. 4/53. Pork ribs - amazing!!!! 5 or 6 large ribs with a very yummy sauce that was slightly sweet but not overpowering. 6/54. Japadog - Not a fan but hubby liked it. Interesting concept though! 3/55. Edamame Then for dessert we went for the:6. Kitkat brownie - holy amazingness. One of the best brownies I've ever had! 8/5 (haha)7. Japanese cheesecake - not so good...weird texture and not too flavorful 1/5.Overall, we were in and out in under an hour, and all the dishes above plus 2 glasses of wine were only $80, so super decent price for the quality of food presented!I strongly encourage you to go and check it out and try to sample different items from the menu because they have a lot of interesting options!

I was really happy with the vibe of the seating area which isn't particularly large but feels spacious. The decor verges on a spoof of itself with the coloured lantern, plastic japanese masks and music. Overall, the noise level of the restaurant is quite high so it can be hard to have a normal conversation without leaning into a table closely or yelling across. In the summer I believe they have a patio out back. I would come back for drinks and a bite to eat but maybe not an overly long meal."

We ordered 5 dishes to share and only one impressed us - the Kamo Tataki. The duck was nothing we've tasted before for a duck dish so that gave our tastebuds a surprise and the apple salad complimented it very well.The mushroom omelette was very greasy and half of it was burnt. I couldn't believe the chef would let that go out of kitchen. The short ribs was overdressed making it extremely salty.

The hostess said she could squeeze us in until 8:45 a group reservation was to arrive, which gave us about 55 minutes. The atmosphere was a highlight, including interesting artwork, people doing a Sake Bombs and friendly wait staff who spoke English and French.  It would fun spot to go with friends to eat and order a couple bottles of Sake before a night out.We ordered the 300ml Pink bottle of Sake. 10/10. Would buy again. For an app we had the soba, which to our delightful surprise was marinated in Korean sauces and Kimchi - definitely a nice choice. Onto the ramen; I had just eaten ramen the night before at a competitor and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I had high hopes. Their ramen included two kinds of pork, minced and a strip of pork, along with veg and an egg. In an interesting twist, they added poutine cheese, which I see as an interesting Quebec-meets-Japan experiment, and I respected the creativity. I wouldn't say the poutine cheese took away anything from the ramen, but it didn't really add anything either, flavor wise. Purists would probably not like it, though there is something to be said about a good poutine cheese and I just haven't quite figured out what that is yet.  I rank their ramen among the best ramens I've ever tasted, and certainly among the best in Montreal.I'd definitely come back to try this place again, particularly before a night out to drink some sake bombs."

We sat at the bar for 15 minutes trying to get somebody to notice us but nobody came to take our order, even though we were literally surrounded by waiters. When we finally managed to order, the food was indeed very quick and very tasty - I had a raw tuna bowl and my boyfriend had their must-try pork ribs. At that point we had to ask the bartender to just drop our cocktails because it wouldn't have made sense to start drinking them half through the meal. He was very sorry and very nice about it.

A perfect spot if you're stuck downtown and want a drink and something to eat. Have the fried pork!"

We ordered Beef Tataki, Spicy salmon, Fried chicken and Beef ribs. All the foods are too small. Smaller than cat's meal. You never get full. And they put too much spices and some kind of herbs. They don't know what is the Japanese food. And all foods and drinks are too expensive. The decoration of restaurant is looks cool but the qualities and details are not really. Some Japanese words are on the wall but it doesn't make any sense."

The jazz music in the background work great with the Japanese art and the candlelight. Open for 7 months, but I can see it'll be around for quite a long time. Wish they had one in San Mateo. Maybe next year!"
/user_details?userid=C9V2zEro96ZPdf7eLOgxdw,Elodie B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I really did not like this restaurant. Its way too loud. I felt pressured to eat because the dishes kept coming so quickly. Last but not least it was so cold all I wanted to do was leave. So many other Japanese restaurants in montreal are better than that. We ordered the gyoza which were not very tasty. How are ribs or corn in any way Japanese? The only decent dish was eda mame.

I'm seated at a little table and chairs touching chairs.. more like jackets touching jackets to the neighbors next to us and I always wonder about the fire and hazard regulations when I'm seated like this. I was taken to this restaurant and was told it's a Japanese Tapas restaurant. All the dishes that came left me a little confused. WHY?! cause they were all mixed Asian foods. Some were Korean, some were Chinese, some were Japanese.At one point someone served us an interesting dish only to take it back soon after we took some pictures of it because it turns out we hadn't ordered it. Thank god they caught on to that! cause it looked good. I loved the Modern Western Japanese twist Art that are on the walls, and the sleek decor. But I felt cramped in the busy and somewhat loud restaurant. After paying the bill and after leaving, I felt it was a little too over priced for food that wasn't that spectacularly good."

Maybe getting back to writing reveiws will be therapeutic for me so here goes...We went here a few months back, they had just opened like the week before and we thought well it's always Kazu or Imadake, it's time we found a new izakaya to add variety, and so Biiru pops up...We had no rsvp, but we got a table. Which was nice. We ordered a whole bunch of things, from ribs, shortrib, soba noodles, gyoza to okonomiyake, fried chicken and yakitori. The only thing we couldn't get was ramen, which they didn't have yet.I told the waitress sarcastically, you expect me to come back for the ramen? I don't think so. But in the end I told her since the food was so good I would come back to check out the ramen. The single best dish was the ribs, fall off the bones, juicy and tender, a little on the sweet side, but since we were four, I only had 2 pieces and the sweetness didn't get to me. The second best thing was the soba noodles which had some bacon bits and kimchi dressing which was easily the most original thing I've had this year.The rest of the food was very good also, but nothing stood out like the ribs and the soba, we finished with a sake bomb and some japanese cheese cake. The place definitely has ambience. I still have not gone back to try the ramen yet but I will soon."

If you're looking for authenticity, you will only find pretentiousness, especially in the menu.

The big murals and the interesting lighting fixtures give it an artsy feel and the overall tone of the place is pretty cool which is rare for a downtown Montreal spot.They have a nice little Isakaya style menu with food that's best for sharesies and a good choice of asian beers and cocktails.Although the food itself didn't blow my mind, it's pretty solid overall and the general experience was quite fun. This is a great spot for a small group of friends that wants something nice but casual. I'd say it's definitely worth trying out if you're downtown and looking for a place that is not packed with cheesy 9 to 5ers or tourists."

They brought me an ice pack, did not charge for my dinner, and paid for my cab.  Here's the not-so-cool thing. The restaurant manager never once apologized for their faulty stool.  And after my husband and doctor friend REPEATEDLY told them to put away this stool and their other faulty stools that apparently were lined up against the wall, the manager refused to acknowledge them.  (My husband and doctor friend checked the other stools near us that's how they knew about there being more faulty stools.)This place loses so many stars for the following two reasons:1.  They never apologized.  This shows a serious lack of responsibility. 1.  There were many faulty stools so mine was not just a fluke.  This makes them negligent.  2.  The management never agreed to remove the faulty stools upon our request.  This shows their lack of good judgement .

My cocktail was the spirulina cocktail which I have not yet had but I love gin so I went for it. Loved it. Super delicate and looked great. Perfect for the meal. Pork ribs were well seasoned and extremely tender. The pancake was full of mushroom savory deliciousness. We all had a really great time.

Even dinner time!!)I'm mostly disappointed with the service we got. We were a group of 10, was never advised about the timed seating during reservation but only midway through, and all the staff could do was insist that the person who confirms our reservation did tell us. I understand you want to enforce your house rule, but what position does that put the client? At that point, I don't even see the point of us staying for the whole dinner, but we did. We rushed to order, we rushed to eat, we were rushed to pay (couldn't even pay separately as we asked at the beginning). That was the worst dining experience. We were good Samaritans and left your restaurant 10 mins before 8:30, your second service. I didn't see any groups waiting after our table, there was no lineup, there were even empty tables. That's unacceptable as a restaurant, in the service industry, to treat paying customers. It's a disgusting money-making gimmick."

It is the perfect summer dish.Pōkuribu (pork ribs) was very good, with a finger-licking good coating sauce.

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally got a chance to try Biiru. I spied it back when it opened and thought the location was original and neat, tucked away on a small street that no one ever really uses anymore. The experience was pretty much as I was expecting, with one or two surprises thrown it. I would say my rating is more a 3.5/5 but since the service was good, I'm rounding up instead of down! First, the alcoholic pitcher they offer (forgot the name, but it's the only pitcher on their menu, $45) is very tasty, stronger than I expected them to make, (considering most Japanese places here in Montreal seem to prefer watered-down versions of drinks), but also a tad too expensive. Nevertheless, I would probably order it again haha. The chicken thigh yakitori were pretty tasty (sweet) but the accompanying tangy coleslaw (I believe it was made out of celeri rave/turnip) didn't do anything for the dish. I would still order it again, since there was a good amount of protein on each stick. The salmon bowl (I think the Taru Taru) was good and had all the requisite ingredients we expect in a raw salmon bowl. Unfortunately, in hindsight, it didn't stand out from any other salmon bowl you can get from Kazu, Imadake, Yokato, or any other Japanese, etc, and the portion was just too small for the price ($13). Now onto the ramen (Ramen 2.0, I think they call it). First, I do usually prefer the richness and saltiness of a tonkotsu based broth; for whatever reason, I find the milky texture of the fatty liquefied pork bones comforting (sorry if I just grossed someone out!). Here, I believe it is a shoyu broth- so lighter in texture, and chicken broth based. The broth was strong enough, and held its own against the ingredients. It came with pulled pork, which I now know is not going to be my first choice of topping, but that's just a personal preference. The cheese curds were fun, and actually seemed to belong in the dish, even if it's an odd choice! It would definitely overwhelm a richer broth, however. The egg was fine, but I prefer the ones from Schlouppe or Imadake &Yokato. They need to reduce the greens they put in the ramen. It was a veritable forest in there! (watercress if I remember correctly, and bean sprouts). Overall, I would order the ramen again (hold the greens!), and more yakitori if I went back. Would I go back, though? Only on a semi-full stomach. I had about $33 (before tax) worth of food, and left only maybe half full. I can think of a lot of places, Asian or other, where I could get a lot more bang for my buck and still have a fun ambiance. But yes, go for drinks, the lively atmosphere and some skewers!"

It took a while for the waitress to notice us which started to get somewhat annoying but finally we got noticed. Lots of small plates versus big plates, and everything was excellent - pork ribs, pork gyoza, salmon sashimi (which I don't recall ordering at $15, but it was excellent with small bits of salmon, rice and sheets of seaweed), chirazu sushi (this was supposed robe the sushi, salmon and eel, but while it was tasty i found more tofu and veggies than sushi) and the candied salmon balls which were excellent but searing hot (ouch!). $95 tax and tip for 2 plus beer kind of expensive but a very good meal in a fun, eclectic place."

In the last years and probably the next ones too, izayakas (which translate to japanese bar) are going to be everywhere. And Biiru jumped on the occasion to open a new trendy and eclectic restaurant in an area where young profesionnals are always looking to have a good time and spend some cash on good drinks and good food. Yes the place is beautiful with high ceilings, good music and a what will look like a beautiful terrace in summer. But, when it comes to food, Biiru unfortunately does not  deliver. The seaweed salad was too citrusy and lack some flavour. The gyoza were just OK nothing to die for. And the chirazhi sushi that I had was lacking something..maybe some texture? Overall go for the vibe and the dexor if you are in the area but with the excellent selection of trendy and lively place in Montreal that offer good food at good price, your hard earned cash can do better in term of food."
/user_details?userid=hYKxkZM1Okcwa6NBexktNw,V M.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Very, very good food - I had the salmon ""bonbons"" (spicy caramel flavor) and the chirashi sushi - very fresh fish.  Also had the ""godzilla brownie"" which was quite tasty.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the amount of fish in the chirashi was pretty minimal - I'd almost recommend ordering an extra salmon sashimi and plopping it on top of the chirashi!  Oh, and great service too (I ate at the bar)."
/user_details?userid=YB8lcCoITYGtw374N8QgJg,Mia C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Overall, this restaurant was good, but I've been to better izakayas in Montreal. I found the portions a bit small compared to other places, so we had to order more than expected and my bill at the end made my heart skip a beat (actually, I think I can speak on behalf of everyone at the table).The decor is cool! The wall paintings are really nice and I like the use of the chalk in the bathroom. The music is a bit loud, but I have to say we were a big group and I was at the far end of the table. The atmosphere is otherwise calm, unlike Imadake and Kinka, but it depends what you're in the mood for.To start off, I had the avocado cocktail... Let's just say I expected it to be way bigger for the price... I was disappointed by that, but I have to say it was good!For the food, if you're a big group, I would suggest breaking up into groups of 3-4 people to order, otherwise, it could get a bit difficult.Everything on skewers was really delicious (we had the eel, salmon and octopus). The fried chicken is a must as well: very tender and yummy with the yuzu sauce. I recommend the dish with watermelon, salmon, crispy noodles and ponzu sauce. It was really tasty; a good mix, really! The beef ribs and gyozas were REALLY good!However, I've had better ramen (not sure about the idea of putting cheese in it...). I found it to be a bit bland... there seemed to be something missing.What I was disappointed of most was the fact that they did not have any sort of japanese style dessert (I particularly love green tea based desserts and it's one of the first things I search for on an izakaya menu). We still decided to take a dessert and went for the Maltesers brownie, which was fantastic!Also, sake bombs are always fun ;) (but not as exciting as at Imadake, sorry!)"

The ribs were really good but thats it, everything else were were bad, the dumplings were tastesless the okonomiyaki was the same, i went there hoping to find something like kazu with good drinks but i was really disappointed. Even the drinks were way to sweet and i couldnt taste the alcohol, service was ok but it was wayto expensive for what you get imadake is wayyyyy better that this place."
