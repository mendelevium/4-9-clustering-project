/user_details?userid=ZqBFC02f34dDg8ryNL1PaA,Ariel D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered a Goat Roti with rice via UberEats, everything arrived well and still hot.The goat was perfectly cooked, very tender and tasty. The curry itself was perfectly spiced (as in seasoned), though not spicy (as in hot) at all...but that is fine for me, as I prefer not too spicy food.I would definitely try other rotis and other dishes they make in the future."
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I just ordered goat curry but this plate doesn't impress me much because the food is dry. I wish they put more sauce and vegetable.
/user_details?userid=s9ic-24SmodR6vHfJWysKg,B N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Judging solely on takeout, this wouldn't be my go-to place for Caribbean in Montréal or in the area.  The roti itself tasted good, but in terms of curries, rice and beans, plantains, and other sides, I've had more flavourful elsewhere. That said, I ate with a friend (who doesn't like spice) who thought it was much better than the other place we tried. So, who knows? To each their own."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My god, this roti was even better than the ones I ate at Trinidad (and I worked in Trinidad for 3 years). They are very generously filled. I'm coming back for sure."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The goat roti was quite good while the jerk chicken was not. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't go as high as 4.I ordered via Uber eats the other night because of the extremely favourable reviews online. First the good news:The goat roti was delicious and filled with small chunks of tender goat and potatoes. I found the filling to be on the dry side. I much prefer a ""wet"" roti like the one at Boom J's. Add some of the sauce to the filling mixture. It would help bring the whole dish together. It was nevertheless well seasoned and came with a small salad and a coke for 13.50$ I would prefer having the option to order a roti a la carte. I don't necessarily need a side salad and a coke. Customers shouldn't be forced into buying a trio, especially if they are pairing a roti with another meal.Now for the problem:The jerk chicken was nearly inedible. It was so ridiculously salty that my entire mouth burned from the salt. It wasn't necessarily overly spicy, but the salt level in this batch of chicken could kill a guy. You can't even taste the jerk seasoning with the overpowering salt commanding your full attention. I took a few bites between sips of water just to be absolutely sure. There's no doubt about it that what I ate wasn't prepared properly. I'm wondering if maybe I got a bad batch of chicken since the reviews for this place are so good. I liked the presentation of the meat which was served boneless over well cooked rice. It's such a letdown when something that looks so good is ruined with salt.My side orders of plantains was absolutely killer! They are served with enough firmness to retain their shape and are bursting with sweet flavour that cuts the rich and spicy food very well.Next time, I would instead try one of their doubles and maybe a goat or chicken plate served in a stewed sauce."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5*I ordered on uber eats so this is based solely on that experience since I have never been to the actual restaurant. I ordered a combo with jerk chicken, rice, salad and a drink. I also got a side of plantains. The chicken was good, a tad bit saltier than I like it though. However, it was well cooked and a sufficient portion. Salad was nothing special.Plantains were perfectly cooked and delicious. I would order again from here but would probably try something other than the jerk chicken. I also want to mention that they prepared the food super fast. Much better than other restaurants who kind of ignore uber eats."

What on earth were we waiting for? The food was fabulous!Pure comfort food with serious flavour. The doubles are incredible, the jerk chicken was amazing. Went in to get takeout and was out the door in about 10 minutes - that's fast, very friendly service!"
/user_details?userid=YeJwlhJhqXt0KFAOP6RgWA,A L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not sure how long this place was open for, but I discovered it in about 2011-2012, when I was living in the area. I now love further away and let me tell you it's worth the journey. I haven't tried their main items, but the best thing about this place is the DOUBLES! And the ROTIS! I can't put my finger on it, but the doubles are nothing like I have ever tried before. I've had them elsewhere but nothing puts a candle to this place. The owners are friendly, and the service is fast. Post up!"
/user_details?userid=qIf8ghcLOIMXsjarC43gAA,Isaac L.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great food!! You have to try the Doubles & the Roti. One of my favourite places for Caribbean food in Montreal. Nothing fancy here, just good food and friendly service. I have eaten in the restaurant and ordered for delivery, the quality is always the same."
/user_details?userid=IRcx08fkw5p6FCxi6BupNQ,Maddie M.,"Westfield, NJ",2 star rating,"I've eaten from here several times and have loved it, and have recommended Tropical Paradise to many people, but I am incredibly disappointed with how my experience was today. I ordered the 'Original Doubles trio (vegan)' from Uber Eats and I noticed halfway into one of the doubles that there was a chunk of meat. **I have been vegan for a long time and haven't eaten meat in over a decade.** I called the restaurant to let them know and the woman who I spoke to on the phone was rude to me and cut me off saying ""no, I saw him make it"" when I explained to her that there was a piece of meat in it. I'm not stupid nor am I blind. I've attached photos of the chunk that was in my food, first what it looked like and then after I spread it apart with a fork. It is definitely meat. And I am definitely annoyed. The thing that bothers me the most is how the woman handled it, I have worked in restaurants for more than two years and I did not find it professional at all"
/user_details?userid=PenRJ_rbZrsRsGOpCKaxWw,F T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time ordering via ubereats. Food came quicker than estimated arrival time. Was very pleased about that. We ordered the goat and chicken roti with a side of plantain. There is so much meat in the goat roti. Wow! Yay! Tasty! It could have been hotter though but still hottish warm in the centre. Properly seasoned, not too salty. The plantain was a bit too darkly fried but nicely ripened. We enjoyed our meal. Will order again."
/user_details?userid=MEIlaaULE0oOReMD265xtA,R J.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Chicken fucking doubles...Hands down, without a doubt, no question, the greatest tasting thing on earth! If I was on death row, this would be my last meal and I would die with full stomach a smile on my face. Up until now, I had no idea that food could taste this great. My only complaint is that I get full from eating this incredible meal which prevents me from eating more. Please, everyone reading this, do yourself a favor and get these chicken doubles today. Get some for you, your mom, your dad, your grandmother, your neighbours, everyone.  Just get some in your mouth ASAP."
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Food is great, gentleman owner at cash is great. Jerk chicken has awesome flavor and spice. Chicken stew is mild but very tasty. Vegetarian dishes of chickpeas, spinach and various other vegetables are super too. I usually get the combo plate that comes with your choice of two mains (I go either for jerk chicken + vegetarian dishes, or on days I don't want to do spice, chicken stew with vegetarian dish) plus tasty rice, some plantains and small green salad. We always do take out just because the ambiance isn't the greatest (but that's not why you should go!). Prices are cheap to fair considering the large portions. This is a family-run business, and it's really nice to see that they appreciate and respect their customers. I hope they stay there forever!"
/user_details?userid=AStTppA8-jqhDxF2kajwaw,Rajendra Réjean K. C. B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent Trinidadian cuisine. Doubles are indeed a treat. Perfectly cooked chana masala between two puris. Chana masala is a chickpea simmered to a delectable state and infused with aromatic and flavourful Indo-Caribbean spices. Puris are fried flat breads made from chickpea flour dough. The combination is irresistible. Served with a sweet and sour tamarind chutney as well as a highly piquant scotch bonnet pepper sauce. This place also has excellent potato balls. Ask for a tall, cool glass of authentic mauby. This is a refreshing root beverage akin to sarsaparilla or a lightly sweetened root beer. You might also want to try the sorrel which is a sweet and festive tonic of a beverage made from the sorrel flower and enhanced with ginger, lemon and various spices. A healthy portion of Caribbean rum is optional."
/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Been wanting to go here for a long time and finally did. Looked at the menu and decided to get the regular size jerk roti and doubles. It came out to around $12. The guy at the counter was really nice and the service was fast. The jerk roti and doubles were both bless, good flavour, spice and pretty filling. I'll definitely come back for more soon."
/user_details?userid=3mRdO02gSlFZfjNqNRawsg,Brandon Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Came here late at night during my last day in Montreal and got the regular oxtail because I grew up eating it. Not fall off the bone soft but was enjoyably tender and had good flavor. Would get it again ^V^
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"My folks in CDN have been coming here for some time, and I can see why. Tropical Paradise is down-home, Trinidadian comfort cuisine at its finest. My go-to is the jerk chicken plate, which is amazing. Grilled slices of jerk seasoned chicken with just the right amount of kick, on top of rice with a side salad and plantains. But the underrated joints here are the doubles, which are a common street food in Trinidad and Tobago. They're basically a sandwich made with fried flat bread filled with curry channa (original) or with meat added (chicken, goat, beef, etc). Cheap, filling, and delicious. The folks who work here are super sweet, and if you decide to dine in, the food and the music will take you back to that Jamaican vacation you took a few years back. Just don't mind the snow outside the window :)"

I didn't know what a lot of the things on the menu were, but the helpful staff instructed me!  I had a goat ""double"" and a side of plantain, and hubby had the jerk chicken plate with salad and rice.  We shared a ""sorrel"" (drink).  Everything was delicious!!  Spicy, but not overpowering.  I understand why this place gets so many 5 star ratings!The ambiance is very very casual (order at the counter/pick it up when ready/clear your own table) but the food is worth it.  We will definitely be back!!"
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tropical Paradise is soooooooooo satisfying!! my mouth is watering just talking about it! Their jerk chicken is flavourful and tender on top of their rice and salad. Their hot sauce is spicy and delicious. But the star of this little restaurant is the ox tail. Ohhh myyy goshhhhhh its sooooooo good literally like butter in your mouth, I don't even understand how the oxtail can be so fall off the bone tender! I would highly suggest Tropical Paradise!"
/user_details?userid=HVGfPIZ-w4f0_CfejUGhxg,Joyce N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,First experience with Caribbean cuisine. I had the goat(or was it oxtail? Don't remember lol!) plate. PRETTY spicy but good. The staff is nice and the environment is calm.

/user_details?userid=BbJD4hZhlIkEh-8HcaedXg,SGdance S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The best Caribbean food in Montreal. Doubles? amazing. Roti? Amazing. Aloo pie? Amazing. Jerk plate? Amazing. Plantains? Amazing. The family running it also amazing! The only sad thing is that I moved away from the city and find myself craving it WEEKLY. It's delicious. Whatever you pick you cannot be disappointed. Make sure to taste their delicious hot sauce as well on the side. Miss you tropical paradise!
/user_details?userid=lNDdOlmN8lu-YJdB-cwfZQ,Cat R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really good food and very welcoming, first time we went we ordered  chana roti, classic and goat doubles, aloo pie, red snaper and curry goat, everything was delicious !! today we got some more doubles (best doubles in MTL), oxtail, curry veggies and once again all very tasty and fresh. This place is becoming my go to spot !"
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Tropical Paradise has been open for a long time. I'm not sure exactly how long, but when I was a teenager I used to come her for 1$ delicious, melt-in-your mouth chickpea doubles. I went back recently and absolutely nothing has changed except that the doubles might now be 1.50$. I had a classic goat jerk and a chicken roti. What I remembered where the fried plantains, the layers of flavour in every bite and the friendly, fast service. It has not changed. Goat melting apart in your mouth, potatoes so perfectly cooked and the spices- the flavours!! My!! I can't wait to get back for another meal. 5 stars!!!"
/user_details?userid=W9X0n1WLmJOOpxspoWN1zw,Georgina H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Love the selection that they have here and the prices just can't be beat!!! The only thing you need to eat here is a double. Ask the staff about it. Look at my video. It's the best thing between two slices of carbs ever. Try the goat. You won't regret it!!! You can also have the original with chickpeas only. So delicious. I need to try other things here but my eyes always hone in on doubles. Yours should too!
/user_details?userid=2iRyEolDQn1OSpyK6icJPQ,David W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Kind of an oddly placed gem, right on Decarie as it is. Never seems particularly busy when I've gone, but the food is really good, and the owners are pleasant."
/user_details?userid=P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,Sadia H.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Best jerk chicken in montreal! Even the rotis are pretty good. I tried the pineapple chicken once and it's not as good as the jerk. The spicy sauce is great too. The place doesn't have the best decor so it's not a good sit down place but the food will blow you away. Great find!Update: I recently tried the oxtail - DELICIOUS!

/user_details?userid=QFwKMj6ygJJ0_PUVLbbvlg,Walid S.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Best jerk chicken in town. A real nice Trini restaurant. I am yet to try other dishes as I always fall for the jerk.
/user_details?userid=N794_0peAHRbj_sJe-d1vA,Tibergula Le Glouton G.,"Arctic Bay, Canada",4 star rating,This place is one of those hidden jewels that everybody keeps a secret and orders from then claims they cooked it themselves. Its known that Caribbean folks are passionate about cooking  and have no problem when it comes to spicing their foods and its safe to say that the flavor boat has dropped anchor in this little gem   . this is a great place to go to try something new and different ... Note the hot sauce is house made and is Hot not hot like wow that's spicy but more like OMG My Mouth is on fire call 911 Hot. you 'll have to try their doubles witch is the Caribbean version of the burger . your pallet will thank you after dining here !
/user_details?userid=zI-QalunKn_0q4ryDnWLyA,Kristen V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm a trinni girl myself, and can cook what I think is some mean west Indian food, so I tend to get extra critical when I eat west Indian food made by other people.When this place first opened years ago, I decided to give them a chance.  I can say with 100% honesty that it has been my go to place for Caribbean take out when I don't feel like cooking.   Their jerk chicken is amazing, their curry chicken is amazing, their doubles are HUGE, and they offer a nice selection of chick peas, chicken, shrimp and goat doubles, and they are DIRT CHEAP.  The food is seasoned perfectly.  It's family owned and the family are such nice people.This is DEFINITELY a place to check out if you are in Montreal and want some good quality west Indian food.  The ambiance is rather bland, although they do have an out of place pool table in the back, but it's the food you're going for, and for the years I've been going there, it's always been consistent, and always been great."
