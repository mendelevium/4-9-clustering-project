On thursdays you can have a small but delicious dish of steak or salmon tartare for $5. I had them both, no regrets. Both plates went along with red wine. Not only was the staff really nice but the ambience was perfect. Great for dates and for groups. The staff was a bit slow that evening but compensated it with great service and they had an awesome comeback afterwards. One of my favorite spots in the Plateau."

There were four other parties at the bar focused on the game, and each group could essentially have its own TV and area because of how the bar is oriented.MTL has a pleasant, modern aesthetic. Love the turquoise-legged stools and port hole windows above the bar that let in sun and views of greenery.We sat at the bar. The microbrew bottle list is small, but there's representation of any beer you might want.Chill spot! Be sure to go to the back and see the VW van kitchen counter and pool table."
/user_details?userid=bfSkQSCq-fmTIJ6RXB4BnA,Evelyn M.,"South Gate, CA",3 star rating,this place is in a really good location! the drinks are made from Canadian spirits and there is a variety to pick from when visiting this bar we unfortunately came at the wrong time there was ONE bartender (very friendly and helpful) and a packed bar. It took us over 15 minutes to even order our drink but over all the drinks were very tasty and refreshing maybe next time we will come at a time when it is not so busy

We were searching around on a Sunday night for places to eat at 7:00, so many of the places were filled up with people and had long waits. I was concerned that since there was no wait for this place, that it would not be very good, but it ended up being great! It has a cool modern atmosphere with comfy couches and cool decor like the bike hanging in the corner and a grill with an old fashioned VW van frame in front of it. I got the fish tacos and shared a kale and quinoa salad. Both tasted fresh and yummy. I think that place was meant for more of a bar than a place to eat dinner, but it was very good regardless. The only thing is I think because of this, the pricing seemed a little bit high."
