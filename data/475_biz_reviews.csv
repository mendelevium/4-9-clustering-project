/user_details?userid=9EL_U6GOh5o-gY8KmS7w-A,Mai T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First heard about it today but it did not disappoint! Ordered the cuban sandwich and the famous pulled pork sandwich. Wow they were both delicious although I have a slight preference for the pulled pork. It was tangy, the pork was tender and the coleslaw was a great texture contrast to the meat. Oh! There was also some hot peppers in the pulled pork sandwich which added a great touch of heat. The cuban sandwich was very good and well balanced in flavor but a bit dry (especially compared to the pulled pork). But flavor was definitely there and all the different meats married well with the mustard. Delicious!"
/user_details?userid=oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg,Rebecca H.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,"This place came up multiple times during a google search for ""must eats in Montreal"". I like to apply the preposition ""le"" before any sentence to make it sound french, so obviously this was a must hit for me. Le Pick Up is famous for probably numerous things but the reason that really caught my attention was their vegan pulled pork sandwich. How in the world? Apparently they use Jackfruit as a pork substitute here. When our uber dropped us off initially I thought maybe I had gotten the address wrong or that it closed because it's located essentially spank in the middle of a random neighborhood (random because I have never been to the city before and am unfamiliar). Sure enough, just to our left was a small convenience store with a sign ""Le Pick Up"" dangling from the facade. It's small inside. To the right is the ordering station and further down the cooking station opposite a counter with stools. There is an old school sign with individual letters tacked on that serves as the menu. We ordered the vegan pulled pork sandwich and the grilled halloumi sandwich looked too orgasmic to pass up. We went into a corner table in the back of the store surrounded by sundries sold by the store and a what appeared to be cookie jar made out of ceramic jean shorts. I couldn't possibly make this up if I wanted to. Eventually the sandwiches were brought to us and they were absolutely gorgeous. The ""pulled pork"" was seasoned and thicc and covered by even thiccer cabbage slaw, all contained within a soft and fluffy bun. This was absolutely delicious and definitely takes up quite a bit of space in one's stomach. I've never had jackfruit before and it's probably my least favorite meat substitute, the texture is the most strange.The grilled halloumi was even better. Halloumi itself is absolutely orgasmic. The saltiness of the cheese combined with the crisp, toasted bread and flavorful slaw. I even munched on one of the random crust CORNERS. What kind of sick fuck am I?Anyways, this was a great place for a low-key, chill, snack-meal. I also hear they have great potatoes."

When you guys reach out to me and ask if I eat for free- You might wanna sit down and reevaluate why you wanna do this to begin with. Come talk to me when your credit card statement is starting to look like a restaurant menu. When people ask me where they should go eat and the feedback I get in return is positive? THAT'S what truly make me happy: To be transparent and be reliable. In all honesty, some hidden gems out there just deserve as much recognition as the big boys in the food industry.Le Pick Up looks like your regular convenient store, a little raw. But when they tell you to not judge a book by its cover, they weren't joking. With rock music blasting in the background, while you're sitting by the counter- you know this is the real deal. Juicy, tender, and most importantly mouthwatering- this $10 Cuban sandwich is THE winner. I always have this idea in my head: It this place worth the drive? The answer is yes.I low key wanna know where your favourite sandwich is in Montreal. SUGGEST ME!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Dropped by on a Saturday afternoon for a sandwich. There was a small line that moved quickly. They had a great selection of beers and drinks and some interesting products for sale in their ""depanneur"" area. We ordered the haloum and faux porc sandwich. The haloum sandwich was delicious, not too salty but juicy and just enough acid. I had never had cabbage and haloumi before, its a great combo. I'm not vegan but I ordered the faux porc because reviews said it was great and i was really curious. It really exceeded my expectations! The faux porc is this thinly sliced tofu with sauce.  The sandwich was so well balanced, the faux porc was great and the slaw, ""mayo"" and pickles balanced out of the faux porc perfectly. My husband just wanted a bite but ended up eating half of the sandwich because it was so good!Cant believe I haven't been to Le pick-up before, I look forward to coming back!"

It's chill and delicious. It's like a crusty old dep with a heart of gold - sweet young punk servers and chefs selling some of my favourite food plus good beers and organic groceries and other corner store things, plus local art and good zines. We can't walk nearby without going cross-eyed craving the veggie pulled pork like it's Pavlovian. Also love the classic breakfast sandwich, the grilled halloumi and pretty much whatever is on special. The owners are badass humans who have gone on to partner with their friends and employees in bringing more dreamspaces into being in Montreal, like Alexandraplatz and Cafe dei Campi. I am, in every way, a fan."

Yesterday, Le Pick-Up allowed for this altered state of reality with its life-changing vegan pulled pork sandwich. I believe I held conversations while eating, but I don't remember a single word of them. I can't even tell you where I was at any point while devouring this masterful ensemble of yuba bits slathered in BBQ, topped with slaw, hot pickled peppers and pickles. Hot sauce. Hot sauce was involved and made a wondrous thing even more wondrous. That's really all I can write about in this review because the deliciousness eclipses just about every other detail... well, except for the fact that the staff is the sweetest and the deceptively humble environs is endearing to regulars and new customers alike. You'd never expect to encounter a life changing sandwich here so that makes me love Le Pick-Up even more!I'm, as we speak, making plans to return to Montreal in a couple months so that I can have daily access to this sandwich. My days will revolve around eating this sandwich. I cannot imagine ever being the same again if I can't have this sandwich."

He had to ask them to remake it to vegan without the mayo sauce since it had eggs. Looked amazing and huge portion but the cabbage was overpowering in vinegar. The faux pork was very good in flavour and had a lot of bbq sauce. There was nothing else to it though.. not worth the $9 to it. Overall, cute shop, hippie ambiance, good flavour of the meat but not the other ingredients and no sides considering how much you pay."

Kool.Decided to take out but still had to wait 15-20 mins to get food.Staffs are very friendly.I had the vegetarian faux pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty decent. The sauce was lightly spicy and sweet but I couldn't really justify 9$ burger tho. just my opinion. (I kept thinking I could've paid a little more to get a complete meal)I also had potatoes on the side but it was just meh (dry and the portion at 4$) All in all, the sandwich was tasty and worth checking it out but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I randomly bixied by Dépanneur le Pick-Up when I was cruising around the area but for some reason didn't stop to check it out. Lucky, I was back in the Mile Ex area a few days later and stopped this time to check it out. It's location is somewhat hidden in a quiet residential area.Hours are decent. Weekdays are 7:00am - 7:00pm and Saturday 9:00am - 6:00pm.Nothing like grafitti on your sign to give it a cool grunge look. Candice wuz hee.Love the old school diner menu. It's almost a throwback to back in the day diner prices. Couple drink options. Cool that there's also a little grocery market inside.Their pastries looked pretty decadent, especially that lemon square.Matching diner booths and decor to solidify the old school look. Ventured outside while I waited for my grilled sandwich to be made. Love how there's two-seaters to sit at right along the sidewalk. Only in Montreal.- Haloum grillé ($8.00) - grilled haloumi with mint coleslaw. Everything is made to order here and you can tell. The sandwich was bomb. Best vegetarian sandwich I've had. Bread was grilled perfect; crispy, golden, buttery goodness.A huge slab of haloumi cheese awaits inside. The texture of haloumi is satisfying and grilling it made it even more so. The inside is packed with ingredients; red and white cabbage, carrots, onion but the game changer here was the mint. Gave it such a refreshingly cool after taste.This is the spot if you want a cheap, delicious made to order grilled sandwich. A depanneur and diner all in one combo."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Overall I'd say this place is a-ok, but its atmosphere and non-food offerings make it quirky and definitely enjoyable! It seems to be a local lunchtime favorite as nearly all of the tables were full. Luckily, I managed to grab a window seat while waiting for my food to come out.I ordered a cappuccino and the pulled pork sandwich. The cappuccino was perfect and came in this beautiful red cup that I really wanted to steal and take back to put in my own apartment. The flavors were bold and strong but not too overpowering or acidic, and it went down so smoothly. I thought the pulled pork sandwich was just okay and nothing too special. Maybe it was a bit too sweet for my taste, as I like my pulled pork to be focused more on the natural flavors of the meat.After eating, I browsed their shelves which held some relics related to all things arts and culture, and I picked up a zine for $2.50 which detailed why you should start a band. I thought it was lovely that the authors decided to address specifically queer and POC female participation in a typically sexist band culture and why it's important to have them represented. It was also funny and carried a sense of honesty that can't be forced. I'll come back to explore their selection of SXSW and other music festival-related goodies next time!"

I am pretty sure it was ""someone else"".Consistently delicious. Casual vibe (it's part of a dep) and off the beaten path - full of local Montrealers. It has a small seating area (maybe 3 tables) and the bar inside, and in the summer there are picnic benches outside.Close to the Jean Talon market if you're in the hood.This is one of those places I hope never changes."

It's a cross between a good old dep and a diner, with a zine rack and an array of weird knick-knacks.  The coffee is really good and so is the food.

But despite being more mainstream, they have definitely kept their hipster roots. This is a perfect place to grab a sandwich to go or enjoy it on their terrace on a summers day.

/user_details?userid=aCxWWhNJ3VRYmGfrHvACwA,Jonathan S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,I love this place! I have eaten here many times and have tried almost all of their menu items (it is not extensive). I fell in love with the ambiance and the food. The restaurant is in a corner store just off of Jean Talon - it's kind of like walking into a mum & pop Depanneur from the 70s. The pulled pork is fantastic but my favourite is their Grilled Haloum sandwich.
/user_details?userid=8JenYJYbj0Nou7IAL1XC0Q,Megumi A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4 star rating,"FAUX PULLED PORK SANDWICH: The bun/bread is good, as are the slaw and pickles. I actually haven't had a pulled pork sandwich since becoming vegan or vegetarian and I'm not sure when the last time I had one when I did eat meat, so although it's been years, I honestly was so surprised by the quality of the faux meat! It's definitely a personal choice, but I'd rather eat just veggies than spongey/tasteless meat alternatives. Note: Order without mayo if vegan. I'm vegan and it's still Very good. Well, I didn't think it was missing the mayo because the BBQ sauce is good.Can't remember the price exactly but it was about $8CAD. And the sandwich was pretty big, I saved half for my next meal!COFFEE/ESPRESSO: I've gotten coffee and espresso here on many separate occasions, and they were always really good. I heard that a couple of the people there work at those high end, chemist-style coffee places, which I know doesn't necessarily mean it's good here but it's a fun fact anyway. Again, don't remember the price but it's like normal not over priced, about $2CAD per drink. THE PLACE: It's still a depanneur, so definitely expect that sort of place. There's seating at the counter right where you pay but there's also a bunch of tables out back. It's super casual but don't let that trick you into thinking all depanneur's have as good as food - they don't. This is quite literally a diamond in the rough (well, not literally obviously).Sidenote: The desserts look amazing (different cookies and pastries, etc.). I haven't tried any because they probably all contain eggs or dairy, but I've seen many a people gush over the chocolate chip cookies and this vanilla pastry that they have. Try one for me."

The only real issue with being a vegetarian is that I always feel left out while my friends have a big meaty paw of a sandwich and I am stuck with what looks like cat food from a tin can smooshed between two lame pieces of bread. Thanks to Le Pick-Up, I too can now have a huge 'meaty' sandwich in my paw! The chipotle mayo and banana peppers provided a nice kick and the bread was perfection: toasted and delicious. My meat-eating lunch mate couldn't get over the texture of the tofu, said it was exactly like real porc. The staff here are friendly and fun, the tunes were cranked and we scored a picnic table right by the door. I love this place!

My. Goodness.Admittedly, I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and as such have never eaten pulled pork before. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to taste like, but if it tastes anything like the incredible faux pulled porc I had here, then I certainly understand the hype. It was so sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. Amazing flavours and perfect crusty bread at a good price. Not to mention, babely eye candy behind the counter taking your order and serving up the goods.

Then topped with tangy and spicy sauce, caraway seeds, pepper, preserved pickle, sweet chili, jalapeño, caramelized onions, vinegary slaw stuffed high between 2 slices of chewy bun! It's a mammoth, my $6.75 was well spent! Service is prompt but expect to wait for 15 minutes to get your items whipped up on a weekend. They even send us a bottle of ice water with clean cups while waiting at the empty communal table, so thoughtful! I guess the heat wave is driving me crazy these days in Montreal but nothing beats this crazier yummy creation by Le Pick-up.The inner space is a little cramped but the patio has a couple of dining tables and seats as well as in the ""secret garden"" at the backyard. I saw a stairway leading to a second level which I do not know if another dining hall exist? The place is just full of artsy vibes!!!!  If you are looking to get some cookies, condiments, canned items, they have a few on the shelve, I am seeing my fave maple cookies that I almost sweep it into my bag!

Well, I kind of feel that way about Le Pick-Up's faux pulled ""porc"". It is seriously the most glorious thing sandwiched between two buns. I am actually salivating as I write this and cannot wait until the next time I sink my teeth into it's edible deliciousness. The best part is that it's not tofu that they use but jack fruit for their ""porc"". Where they find jackfruit, I'm not sure. One day I will take the time out of my day to find out but for now I depend on Le Pick-Up for my fixture. The staff is always friendly and they have fridges full of cool drinks like Curiosity Cola and what not. I like Boylan's Ginger Ale which they keep in stock. I could shower in it.There are other sandwiches as well, but unfortunately I know nothing about them so its for you to find out. One of my friends swears by their tuna sandwiches and it runs out fast so best go early if you wanna dig into this fish sandwich.Side note: A lot of people think the faux pulled ""porc"" is vegan but there is mayo in this sandwich so its best to skip the sauce if you wanna keep it ""ethical"" for all you vegans out there."

The bun and dressings also added a nice presentation to it. It felt like I was eating a super manly and substantial sandwich, which is not often something you get when ordering vegetarian sandwiches.

I've tried a couple of pulled pork sandwiches all over the US and surprisingly, this place takes the cake. Well balanced with pickles, mayo, pickled banana peppers and cole slaw...crunchy yet airy bread...It was great. The Pick-Up also sells a small variety of ginger beers, which was a big plus for me / a wonderful surprise. If you're in this neighborhood, you MUST try it out. Plus this place is a stone's throw from Jean Talon market, I recommend visiting both in a single outing.Price: $7.50"

It's nice, juicy, fresh and has an amazing taste! I would recommend to take home potatoes as side dish. After taking this lunch you will be thinking  about a nap :-)"

I had the special which was a lemongrass beef sandwich with Kim-chi. It was so good! my friend had the pulled pork that looked really awesome. Although, I've REALLY thirsty ever since. The atmosphere is very laid-back casual but clean. Waiters were great. Very friendly and checking up with us often to make sure everything was good.I will definitely go back again."

Whether you're vegetarian or not, the faux BBQ sandwich is outstanding, and the ""tunathon"" is the best tuna sandwich I've ever eaten. The cookies are also fantastic. Cool setup, great people, great food. Can't recommend enough."
/user_details?userid=zjCkHoEjvbfbfCKbyvTxkg,Hayley V.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"i live for places like this and if there was one in my neighborhood I would go there every day. It's an eatery hidden inside a convenience store with a fresh, delicious, and inexpensive menu. Try the 'pulled porc' and you will not be disappointed. Downsides: seating is limited, wait times are long, and it's best to bring cash but the food is worth it. You're welcome."
/user_details?userid=S_sIeCOqy7F4RFs0le1cDQ,Joel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Awesome food from a converted retro dep hidden away in a quiet side street near Little Italy. Vegetarian pulled pork sandwich is sublime. Staff are super friendly and interesting.

/user_details?userid=fAkZJRqGUtkYMe7WBvUaVw,Karen N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Came on suggestion from a veggie friend who used to live in the area. The veggie pulled pork was incredible. It is  made of  seitan and it is absolutely delicious. One of the best veggie sandwiches I have ever had. Also had the halloumi which was also perfect. Wish I lived in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=_PlVMtt4bwiOAalr1wso9A,Grant H.,"Victoria, Canada",4 star rating,"Wonderful.  I was enchanted at once the first time I walked in here upon sight of the inexplicable gigantic toothbrush.  This is in fact a depanneur, but they have a sweet little kitchen to pump out delicious meaty (or not) savory meals.  Upon sampling every sandwich on the menu (not in the first visit) I'd have to say that the winner is a tie between the Club Chipotle (club sandwich with chipotle sauce) and the Post-Reveillon (turkey and cranberry!).  Of the two times I had the pulled pork, it unfortunately varied.  My first was not nearly moist and flavorful as it should have been, yet the second time (when Beaver was in the kitchen) it was deeeelicious and perfect.  My plate was a mess and I licked it clean.  In public.I have as of yet to try the soups nor the salads, but I surely will sometime soon.A solid place for cheap and filling eats to show your out of town friends a little slice of Trouvé-seulement-à-Montréal"" dining or just to meet up with local friends for a delightful bite.  Nice and hidden so the dummies from McGill can't find it as it's located outside of the McGill ""Ghetto."""

'really really good' was all i could muster. as a measure, the most ""really's"" in a row i've given before proclaiming something was good was 3, her name was jezebel. i want to assure you that two really's are seldom uttered in rapid succession, i don't throw them around lightly.  the pulled pork was really really good. note - the prices on their website are currently out of date, in most cases the sandwiches were $0.50 - 1 dollar more than what's indicated."
/user_details?userid=l_-IvCLz6Z28IYZbi22ltA,Christine Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best pulled pork in the city, hands down - including the vegetarian version, which is delicious! They also make a fantastic iced coffee and have a super charming little patio in the back, which is the perfect place to spend a sunny Saturday morning. The kind of amazing in-between place that makes me adore Montreal. Just don't all go swarming the place, because this is my favourite neighbourhood spot!"

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is Le Pick Up's claim to fame. Slow roasted pulled pork sandwich in barbecue sauce, served with grilled peppers, coleslaw on a Portuguese style bun. REALLY tasty. Straight up. There was a certain zing to the barbecue sauce and it was complimented perfectly with the crunchy slaw directly in the sandwich. All it was missing was fries and they could have called it a ""Po'Garçon""."
/user_details?userid=_ow-WHamb41wjRKZvFL3yw,Lucy B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lunchtime might be busy here but I enjoy the hustle and bustle of sitting at the counter and chatting with the chef while watching my food being made. Once you're a regular here, you'll get treated like family. Try the powermade in the summer: a delicious homemade hibicus iced tea, or try one of the best iced coffees in town (add your own sugar and milk! tasty espresso! ) During the week, if Michael made the soup of the day, always order it, he's amazing at it. Best breakfast sandwich ever: your choice of ham, bacon, cheddar or veggie ham, a fried egg, your choice of bread (including corn tortillas) lettuce, tomato, mayo- but they'll always let you add things for a few extra cents (i say do bacon AND cheddar, make the mayo chipotle and add hot peppers). This place is loud but friendly- if you're in town and you don't know anybody, here are some very sweet and funny people who will make you feel like you're among friends."
