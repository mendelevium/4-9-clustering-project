/user_details?userid=v3Pdf-EED0oFnySQA99UFw,Leonard L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Been here on back to back days during my short trip to Montréal. It's a real local gem; its not that close to the busier area of Avenue du Mont-Royal, but it's definitely worth the short trek! I had their Le Burger Belles Sœurs with the beer combo, and then the bison (?) burger special and the galvaude the next day; they were all delicious! Brought a bunch of friends the next day and it was a total hit with them as well. Our server was great, answered all the questions we had and was very accommodating especially since we didn't speak french.We'll definitely be back when we return!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Visited this quaint little dinner in the Plateau for lunch with a couple of friends on a cold winter's day for a quick bite before returning to work. This space is very homey, with daily specials on a chalkboard, and the service is very friendly; felt like dinning at a friends house. The daily special comes with soup and dessert for a very reasonable price. I opted for the vegetarian burger instead and loved every bite! The burger is actually a slice of tofu and it was served with fries; burger was juicy and flavourful and the fries were perfect. My lunch partners went with the daily special of meatballs and mash. They both loved it although they thought the soup entree was way salty and didn't finish it. Overall, great experience; I would return for a cosy lunch anytime!"
/user_details?userid=OhJHYrDzZA4ux0WLX-nAfg,N C.,"Murrieta, CA",5 star rating,We enjoyed the food and hospitality. Great neighborhood place. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Burgers were juicy and the bun was soft and delicious. Frites were crunchy and perfect accompaniment to the burger.
/user_details?userid=GacSO0rpHBbZFULn7xxe8Q,Mark M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5 star rating,"We were waking from Downtown to the Botanical Garden and tried Les Belles Soeurs because of the rating.  It is a simple causal neighborhood restaurant   The service was excellent, the food was the best we had in our visit to Montreal.   Not fancy, but well done and of good quality.    Highly recommend if you are seeking simple fare."
/user_details?userid=O0PGfIbPGvbsZ0XpWFbMqg,Zoe S.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,"So freaking good overall. I got the lamb burger. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The bun was like a potato challah. So soft and yummy. The sauce was so delicious, just wish there was a bit less so I could taste the meat a little more. The poutine was pretty good. About average. The service was awesome. Our waiter was super cute"
/user_details?userid=zDgZawGVnPL4sLzEiKOxUA,Jillian G.,"Civic Hospital - Experimental Farm - Central Park, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little neighborhood joint to grab a quick bite in! Large portions & affordable pricing. Loved the burger, cooked great on a fluffy bun & I ordered it with a side of fries/salad which filled me beyond belief!Only complaint would be no AC meaning maybe don't go when it's 40 degrees out.. but otherwise a great stop when you're in need of some fuel."

/user_details?userid=s1FQcJ1Yd_Kk-zDEcl-2LQ,Carter B.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,We went to this burger place right after we first arrived in Montreal not knowing what to expect. We all ordered different kinds of burgers and all agreed they were simply excellent. Staff was very good at checking on us to make sure we have everything we need. And I know this is random but you HAVE to use their bathroom!! It may be the best part of the restaurant :)
/user_details?userid=J3QmCrc_b5POljkbAL2xfA,Danielle D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Piece of paradise. Feels like home, that is, if your home has funky decor, mega delicious food, and friendly people. What took me so long to come here?"
/user_details?userid=JU4G6DRPbN29h1_Is1BmyA,Mark B.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,"For our first night in Montreal, We looked on Yelp for a place for dinner. And, Les Belles Sœurs was incredible! I ordered Le Burger Belles Sœurs and it was the most delicious burger I have ever eaten. It was succulent and incredibly yummy. The service was wonderful and I love the quirky decor. I highly recommend this gem! It is not to be missed."
/user_details?userid=_ZVA75Y6mt_RmnjTsoi37w,WinDar Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This is the second time i come here. First time  i wasn't impressed so i decided to give it a second chance. The food is good but the service is very looong! It does not deserve 5 stars.
/user_details?userid=xERNrqTL5y1WW5fN4htRBg,Elizabeth F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It has one of THE best veggie burgers I have ever had. I have such a hard time finding good vegetarian options, especially since most people just throw on a pre-processed veggie patty, but not this place. I never get tired of ordering it, in fact I've had it for breakfast a few times ( haha ). The ambiance is pretty good here too, lots of cool details, design, and the staff are really laid back and friendly. Love it!"
/user_details?userid=eWUWCTB5bKs_-rgxbcjALw,Ayoub R.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely fantastic place! It's probably the best place I've been in Montreal for burgers. It's a small little restaurant and if you're in the neighborhood or on the plateau, it's worth a little walk. Great place and the 5 stars are completely worth it."
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Didn't live up to the 5-star reviews being left. Was passing by the area and decided to Yelp to see if there were any standouts in the area to grab a bite. Surprisingly, this place had a 5-star rating from seven different people, and I figured they couldn't ALL be wrong?? Worst case, it's more like a 4 star, I thought. Well, unfortunately, the lamb burger I ordered (special of the day, the ""Mexican"" with guacamole, corn relish, cheddar, etc) was nothing to write home about. Meat was pretty dry even though I asked for a medium burger (I get the feeling even though the server nodded her head when I asked for medium, that they just automatically cook everything pretty well done). All the toppings on the burger just didn't come together, and the sourness of the corn was off-putting. The worst was the Velveeta-tasting so-called cheddar. It was almost liquid cheese, totally processed, and didn't taste at all like cheddar. Fries and salad on the side were OK, not great. My burger, fries + one beer (included in the trio) was something like $17+ tax. The place itself is small and very hot inside due to no AC. I wouldn't mind the lack of air conditioning but since the grill/kitchen area is open to the rest of the resto, it got very hot and unpleasant. I don't think this place would survive if it were in a location that gave it competition. Oh well, at least I can say I tried!"
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?"
