Even the interior in beautiful. It is several tapas to share, I love those kind of restaurant. But here they know how to revisit common plate by mixing unusual flavors together. I spent my time being surprised.Big plus: the ratio quality / price is really good I took 7 or 8 tapas, 1 beer & 1 glass of wine for 90$ with taxes and tips"

What can I say this place us what I miss about Montreal now that I live in Ottawa:Cool vibes, amazing tasty food, trendy feeling, packed and alive after 10pm. The stuff were also super nice (but that we do have in Ottawa). My friend liked one of the dishs so much he wanted more so they arrenged a large portion of the side dish just for him, and with that they won the 5th and 6th(if I could) star."

It's literally one of the only hot spots that is open on a Monday night so yes, it was busy at 7:00 pm. As lovely as the indoor space was, we opted for the small terrace in the back of the restaurant. Although it doesn't have much of a view (basically overhead residential balconies and a parking lot), it is nice to have the option of outdoor seating. The tables were cozy and candlelit, and offered a relaxed feel. The music inside did get louder as the night progressed but the repertoire was awesome, and added to the neighbourhood hangout feel this space seems to have become. We were warmly seated and greeted by the wait staff who patiently explained the menu as well as the various wines on their list. The food menu was comprised of seasonal sharing plates, as well as a variety of side dishes including cheeses and charcuterie. In order to get the most of our experience, we opted for the platter option where they assemble a sample of their sides dishes including cheese, charcuterie, pickles, beets, olives and bread. As recommended, we also ordered three of the most popular sharing plates including the Boxermans sandwich, the tomato provençal, and the stuffed zucchini. From start to finish, the food was impeccable! Great flavour, perfectly executed, and great ingredients; you can taste the freshness of the produce. Three plates was much though after having such a big platter for an opener. The waiter was also bang on in recommending a great crisp and light white wine; loved that most of the wines are also available by the glass cause we finished that bottle fast! This place is my new coup de cœur, offering great food at very reasonable prices, a great bar and drink selection, and a laid back feel in a beautiful setting; it doesn't get better!"

AMAZING list of private importe sulfate free wine. Recco ordering 2-3 plates per person. Good for groups of 4 would not recommend larger. Great neighborhood ambiance. Perfect for a Saturday night dinner plan for a few hours.

We were at the bar right next to the open kitchen so got to watch everything being prepared. The aubergine, carpaccio and rissoto were all spectacular and they even gave us a free chocolate mousse which was excellently done. The wine list was also very impressive. Over all one of the best restaurant experiences I've had to date."

We ate outside and we allowed the chefs to bring us their best selection and it was way beyond what was expected. The wine they suggested was perfect to pair and overall it was our best meal while visiting for the long holiday weekend. For a nice, light, tasty, and unique dining experience, enjoy some dishes from Boxermans"
