Or maybe fresh, homemade bread to bring to a friend's wine and cheese? Check out la Bête a pain! I love passing by here whenever I'm in the neighbourhood. Parking is hard to come by, but this little gem of a spot is worth it! In addition to their sandwiches, they have lovely salads and baked good (try to choco chip cookies!)."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a really nice location. Their store is bigger than I expected and for covid reasons they have set up a way of circulating throughout the store that brings you through all their products. You pass by the virnnoiserie section, then the pastries and then ready to eat, coffee, wines and canned products. We decided to try their brioche brownies, cannelé, almond apple brioche and 3 little cakes. Everything was good , it just wasn't great. The brioche had almost no brownie inside and the little cakes lacked some flavor. The cannelé were very good though! I think other chains like amour du pain and les pains dans les voiles are much better."
/user_details?userid=ulgeAt99UluIQs8nuqnFNg,Tyler K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4 star rating,Cozy bakery with cafe that offers many treats. Went during covid restrictions. Doing a great job with contactless business. They offer lots of artisanal breads and things like jam. Four stars reflected by menu items being a bit pricey
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Yes, it's well known that this bakery (though it's so much more than that) has great coffee and tasty treats; However, that's not what makes them special. The fact that this is one of the very few places to get quality breakfast during the week, wins major points in my book!I got the avocado toast which was tasty and beautiful. Was it the most mind-blowing toast I've ever had? Not exactly, but it was good. It was made to order, the portion is massive and the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. Also, the coffee was fantastic!Also, this place has a great ambiance and vibe. There's lots of natural sunlight (which early in the morning I truly appreciate). This may be my new early-morning, week-day spot. I'm excited to return and try the French Toast!"

This cafe in particular is tucked away at the entrance of Must Société, this giving it a cozy, only in-the-know feel. Friendly service, plenty of options, communal environment."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love a good bakery. You walk in and the smell of fresh baked goods just hits you like a wave. It is both pleasant and mouth watering. It is hard to enter a bakery and not leave without a few good items - much to the dismay of my scale. In my neighbourhood of Pointe St-Charles, we still lack a true great bakery but luckily I am close enough to a few wonderful ones in St-Henri, Little Burgundy and Griffintown. Bête à Pain in Griffintown is one such place. I had been in a few times to try some bread but hadn't found the occasion to try their sit-down services as they offer breakfast, lunch and apero until 7pm. That changed recently as it became the perfect place to meet up with our Architect friend to discuss some life stuff for the wife and I (yay home reno plans!) and have brunch at the same time.First off, La Bête à Pain is a beautiful bakery. Attached to the MUCH société store off of Peel St., it definitely goes the extra mile in creating a visually stunning space. There is a great use of the industrial traits of the building - the brick walls, the high ceilings - and then adding some softer touches to play off of it. The use of an all glass wall at the entrance to get lots of natural light, hanging plants, the use of old wooden tables, wood lats covering the ceiling, etc. The focal point of the space is the open baking area itself with a beautiful display counter for the goods. Very appealing when you walk in!We arrived early enough that we had the breakfast options to choose from. The menu is smallish but still has good variety and naturally uses fresh baked goods they produce on hand. My wife went with the pain perdu - served with ricotta mousse, pear compote, mint, caramelized pecans and a caramel sauce. A decadent dish to be sure for breakfast/brunch but hey why not? My wife loved the pecans, the sauce and the pear compote but something about the ricotta didn't pair well with her. I enjoyed it more than she did but yes there was something off a bit with it - the ricotta tastes like nothing really so it just added richness but in a fad way that really lingered more than the other great elements of the dish. I went with the smoked salmon croissant served with dill, capers, red onions and creme fraiche. Huge hit for both of us. The croissant was buttery flaky perfection - tender and soft but firm on the outside. Pairing that with smoked salmon is no brainer and the addition elements worked great as a whole. An excellent breakfast sandwich.In the end, the meal was not perfect but definitely enough to entice us to return again. Bête à Pain is worth a visit alone for their wonderful bread and baked goods. If you are a little more hungry than that, it is definitely a good option to consider. Cheers!"

Not salty like you are used to in the states! Everything we ordered was delicious accept the orzo cold pasta. That was under seasoned. Customer service was great and friendly staff! Definitely would come back here. The decor is great as you are surrounded by fresh bread and pastries.
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of Bete a Pain. We have now worked a stop at Bete a Pain into our standard weekend routine. The bakery is conveniently located in Griffintown, not to far from home so we will typically stop in to grab a quick bite to eat and some bread to take home. The one warning about Bete a Pain is that it is connected to the Must furniture store so the trick here is to make a sop at the bakery without spending a thousand bucks on furniture on your way out. ;-)I really enjoy all their bread, which they bake on site in small batches throughout the day. Which means that there is a good chance that the baguette that you pick up will still be warm. My favorite loaf is the pain multigrain, but everything is good. As for brunch (served till 11:00 AM sharp) and lunch: Everything on the brunch menu is very good, but my fav is clearly the avocado toast. Served open faced on a slice of toast this dish offers a generous amount of avocado with a perfectly cooked egg, yolk still runny,with nice highlights to the flavor coming from olive and sesame oils and a sprinkle of bee pollen. On the lunch menu the grilled cheese is great as is the baguette sandwich, which s super simple but really hits the spot. The only item I would suggest you avoid is the tuna tataki which was a bit disappointing. But, in fairness this is not really the type of establishment that you would expect to find the greatest tuna tataki (if I were them I would remove it from the menu as t is a bit out of place). All around major thumbs up to Bete a Pain!"
/user_details?userid=74Myfl8pOGeKcmkVTimsvg,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",5 star rating,"A really lovely bakery in Griffintown and a great place for breakfast.  Our first visit was on a Friday and it was nice and quiet.  We opt'd for a couple of croissants and coffee. Both the almond and chocolate croissants were heavenly. The chocolate was rich & good quality and the almond was not your typical almond croissant where there is some almond paste in he middle; this version it is worked into the croissant itself and it's awesome.The second visit was a Saturday morning and the place was packed.  There was only 1 poor waiter responsible for all of the tables so things took longer.  The avocado toast was served with a poached egg over multi grain bread; it was an excellent version.  The ricotta with strawberries was served on the corn bread and was delicious.We also tried a chocolate eclair; the best I have had anywhere.  An exceptional place worth a visit;, those who live in the area are very lucky to have it."

/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My new obsession here is their rosemary fig loaf. It is just perfection. Just the right amount of sweet and savory.  Unless you are watching your carbs, feels like a balanced diet to me!  They also have ready made meals that you can take home and feed a small army. The meals vary. It's usually a pasta casserole. The other day I saw a creamy mushroom soup that looked amazing. So if you're in a pinch and lazy to cook, you can always stop by here to pick up a quick easy dinner."
/user_details?userid=R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"La bete a pain is a great bakery in Griffintown. All their products are fresh and the quality is very good. The bread and baguette are prepared daily.I suggest you try their fig and romarin bread, amazing with any type of cheese and wine. They also have soft bun for burgers too. I always take the latte. Last time I was there, I took the beignet a l'erable which I recommend. Also, they propose 3 to 4 variety of french desserts like the lemon tart with meringue on top, the chocolate religieuse, the eclair du jour and others... This place is always crowded and you can pass by at any moment of the day and enjoy their crunchy and perfecly baked croissant. Go for the almond. For lunch and 5@7 they have a menu with small servings/portions.You can try their fried chiken burger or their tuna tataki or their amazing jambon fromage baguette. The entrance is located on young street which isn't very crowded. This allowed the bakery to be quiet and cozy for couples to meet there. In addition, it is connected to Must society.When I am done from la bete a pain, I always exit by Peel street. This allows me to pass by Must and see if they have any new furnitures.I should mention that the decor is one of the finest,  a mix between the oriental and occidental."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wanted to try a new brunch place or a cafe for quick breakfast, when we came across this place on Yelp. It's really close to where I live so decided to give it a try. Have to say, my husband and I were not disappointed at all. They share the space with the Must Societe store. So we walked into the store and just asked the staff their for this bakery. We ordered the cauliflower soup, grilled cheese and the chicken burger. Everything was amazing. The grilled cheese portion is vey generous - 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in one order. I struggled to finish just the one sandwich, took the 2nd sandwich to go. The kimchi chicken burger was very flavourful. Every bite burst with so much flavour. The soup was creamy and delicious. It's more of a winter comfort food kind of soup so I wouldn't get it again on a warm summery day. Our take-away: we could have shared the grilled cheese and soup. Next time, I won't get the grilled cheese unless I am sharing it with someone. Service was decent, not bad. Our food came pretty fast, so no complaints."

I highly recommend them."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: In Griffintown. Street parking is available but you'll need to be patient when looking for a spot. I have no idea how you'd there via transit but I'm sure there's a bus from somewhere, that will get you here. Place: It's pretty small so if you want to brunch on a weekend, you should get there early. The goods: This is going to be a preliminary review until I go back for brunch... I stopped in to get coffee, and decided to get bread too. I got the sun-dried tomato fougasse. It was very fresh and smelled delicious. Taste-wise, it underwhelmed me. Wanted to love it, but oh well. The latte (almond milk) didn't work for me. It was very bitter. Service: Great - very friendly. Price point: On par with similar places. Will update review after my redo."

Rustic atmosphere, great service and great desserts. They change their soup menu every week and you can ask for bread for sides. Creamy soups with fried onions toppings is something you definitely need to survive Montreal winter's. Chicken burger , ham sandwich and their grilled cheese sandwich are great too. Cinnamon bun and their almond croissant is drool worthy. You can load more carbs to go by buying their bread ."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hubby picked this place for a Sunday brunch recently and after looking  at the reviews and pictures I was soooo excited to try it out. We arrived around 2pm and had to wait in a quick 10 minute line to be seated. Having read amazing reviews about the chicken sandwich, I opted for that while my partner went for the classic jambon beurre. We also decided to try to peanut ginger salad. Sadly, my sandwich fell flat. It was nothing special and I found myself really regretting my choice within the first couple bites. The salad on the other hand was amazing - I could eat that thing forever and never get bored! After our meal, we decided to try some of the yummy looking pastries and went for the chocolate amandine and a brownie stuffed pastry. Unfortunately neither one was really great (comparing to French pastries from France and/or Mamie Clafoutis in the city). As cute as this place is, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon but definitely check it out if you're in the mood for some bread (so much variety!)"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I initially was pretty stoked for the prospect of a sit-in bakery space. I love the idea of being able to do some laptop work while being surrounded by the sweet aromas and gentle heat of a large bread oven; throw in a beautiful Griffintown loft-like space and I figured I was in like sin. Once I actually got into the space it felt pretty textbook hipster fare and actually kinda uncomfortable for a long sit.I definitely resonate, however, with other reviewers in that the service was very good. I sat through the lunch rush and watched some of the most unpleasant patrons enter and give a consistently hard time to the servers. They responded consistently professionally and with a smile to what is obviously a generally obnoxious lunch crowd. The resiliency of the staff was definitely the most impressive part of la bête à pain.As far as the bread goes, I didn't think it really tasted much better than your standard-issue Premier Moisson loaf (available at the grocery store) and the price was more expensive. While it was a half-decent loaf, it definitely felt and tasted like a franchise product (which it tries to evade with it's Griffintown-specific concept). Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the product, but I think you could take the time to visit independent and more specialized bakeries in the city for a better bread for the same price."

/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Their bread was heavenly and delightful. While the smell was fresh, and delicious. Montreal does have many amazing bakeries, which they impress most of us who are foodies with a strong focus on buying local and from small stores. I'm one of them! For me it will always be a mix of quality over quantity with a good value. La Bête à Pain hit the spot beautifully! This is why... Due to the fact that I visit the bakery at 4:00pm on a Saturday, I've missed the chance to sample their lunch menu, which included sandwiches, and salads, etc made fresh to order!I will certainly be coming back!As I sit down, I observe the ambiance. Casual, nicely, and uniquely decorated with comfortable space, and high ceilings. Glass windows throughout, therefore you have a great amount of sunlight. Great while you sip your coffee or tea. Although do take a break from your typical cup of tea or coffee and try their hot chocolate. It's prepared to a perfect temperature, not at all overly sweet, great hints of dark chocolate with a generous size of their homemade marshmallow. You won't regret it! I promise.  One of the highlights for me was being able to see everything upfront. From the variety of bread, to step by step of how the bread is made. Views of their large ovens, and their talented staff working hard, and fast. When glancing at their large variety of breads, I simply couldn't decide. Luckily I stumbled upon a wonderful, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable chef named Russel. Who took his time to show me around and explain in details everything about their breads, desserts(Eclairs,Beignets) Their bread is baked to perfection. Golden and crusty on the outside, while being tender, moist with good structure on the inside. Indeed their primary focus is bread. Which it shows. Having said that, do take the time to focus on their desserts. Which includes a good variety of Eclairs or hot and freshly made Beignets. Sadly, I've missed my chance since I was there close to their closing time. Coming back to their eclairs. These are not your lightweight, fluffy tasteless filling inside with touches of food coloring. When you try La Bête à Pain eclairs, you will taste a bite of sweet perfection. They are filled with silky smooth custard, as they should be. A delicate glaze on top that ranges from chocolate, to maple and the list goes on. No food coloring. Simply, and naturally delicious.  Last but not least. Some of you may not be familiar with a Canelé. Which is  is a small French pastry with a soft and tender custard center texture and a dark, thick caramelized crust. A typical pastry from France. I highly recommend it! It's not overly sweet, it has a wonderful hint of vanilla from their vanilla bean(Lovely amount of specks!) and a crunchy caramel tone exterior. Overall my stomach was very pleased, and I left with a smile.  Job well done!"

It was amazing- loads of avocado, tomato, cucumber all piled on top of a crusty piece of whole grain bread. Yum! My wife had the pain perdu which was also amazing. It's sort of like French toast or bread pudding served with ricotta, strawberries, mint, and honey. Really, the two dishes we're outstanding.  I would give it 5 stars for Wednesday. We went back Thursday and I ordered the egg salad sandwich and my wife got the avocado toast. Both were way too salty. Maybe the chef was different from the day before? It was disappointing.  We also got a croissant, and it was not flaky; it had a bread like consistency. :(We loved our server on Wednesday. Thursday's sever was sweet but very slow. We had to ask for our check twice; it was weird.

Their desserts are amazing too, I forgot the name of the one I had but I'll put the photo and they have it everyday but they sell out before noon usually! The veggie sandwich was also delicious with eggplant and bell peppers and cheese, grilled panini style on olive bread, really recommend you try both and split with a friend! The place is also adorable and and super cute for a friendly lunch or a date. And I love the washrooms, huge and super nicely 'modernly' decorated.. the café is at the back of an amazing boutique furniture store so it's the perfect social place to go eat cause you can browse furniture for fun after lol anyway I'll post the photos and they should speak for themselves. But last thing, I love the staff!! Super cute and friendly, new favourite café/bakery/lunch spot in Griffitntown! But lunch food is only served until 2:30pm then it's only baked goods so go early haha today they reserved 2 sandwiches for me to go and they prepared them for me just before they closed the kitchen and held them for me! :) so love the people working here too! (My friend loves their fresh baked baguettes and bread too, but I still need to try those so I can't comment yet!)"

They do have a breakfast menu as well where you can sit down and enjoy their meals. We had the avocado toast and croissant with salmon and we both loved what we got. This bakery will amaze you with its ambiance, service and taste for sure. Be sure to check out the store next to it- I loved the plates, cups, etc. they have really cute stuff!"
