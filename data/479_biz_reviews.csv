Their pastries are more expensive than other bakeries but they are very good! It has such a nice ambiance as well. They play jazz music which adds to the reason why I love going here."
/user_details?userid=DQ-sNY_J0Dp_adIu0jnu_A,Bella N.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Duc de Lorraine's a really charming spot for all sorts of baked goods. The service was warm and welcoming, and our orders were brought to our table quite quickly. I had the quiche de Lorraine warmed up, and it was flakey and light. The serving size was good, and the prices seemed fair. It just wasn't a standout bakery, but it wasn't a bad spot at all."
/user_details?userid=MMKknEw3lR1hZ1-SpORFHw,Diana L.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,If you're missing the airport come here. Just kidding. Sort of. Prices are high and food is below par. 14.50 for a 6inch baguette with cheese and a slice of ham?! I got two sandwiches and two salads and two pastries and the total was 100$. If the food was amazing - fine. But it was less than ordinary and gave me heartburn which I rarely get. If you don't like your salad drenched in salad dressing please tell them to put it on the side. That was a big mistake and I ended up using 8 pieces of paper towel to attempt wiping the sauce off at home.  It reminds me of mediocre airport food at insane prices. I can think of many better places in Montreal to eat including the ready made food at the Atlantic grocery store next store!Oh the vibe is nice and the people are friendly but with covid that only goes so far...
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Granted, making pastries of such a high quality and for so many years it no easy task - however I would never have expected their Religieuse au Café (coffee cream stuffed pastry treat) would cost $7 (and now ironically days later raised to $7.25). I'll openly admit that is was a real treat, and big enough to save a couple of bites for later in the day. As a point of interest the croissants were larger than most, but not as good as many and again pretty expensive at $3, so perhaps there is a trend going on. Indeed, the place is lovely to the eye and they have numerous authentic French bread and pastry treats to eat on site or take out. Regardless the decor and service are above average and is worth a visit if you are prepared to 'shell' out.Note: If you think the pastries are expensive, checkout the coffee prices. The brunch are lunch are no steal either. I'm all for reputation deserving of a little bump up, but these levels are even more than I imagined."
/user_details?userid=qHhIOpSB9q2E6JmWbzV0BA,Christa Lei S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"The food is good, but the service is extremely slow. The waiters were kind and friendly-- but service was way too slow. We waited for a quiche, croque monsieur and two soups for two hours! By the time our mains (quiche and croque) came around, we were not even hungry. Disappointing because the food was delicious but the long wait left our appetites to be desired. I believe their kitchen is not big, and the dishes are coming out slow because of it. If you are coming here for dessert (ready made in the case) and coffee, you will be fine. Anything that involves the kitchen? Expect at least an hour half wait. My bf and I were disappointed in how long it took that it out a bad taste in our mouths. We won't be back due to this. Unfortunate as this is so close to the Oratoire."

I wish i can give this place ten stars! The bus tour guide told us about this bakery, so we hopped off and had to check it out. I literally just wanted to taste everything in this shop!I couldn't even decide what I wanted as there were so many choices, pastries, cupcakes, truffles, etc. I selected the almond-filled croissant. WOW it was just amazing, I wish I bought another one, or ten. Another selling point: they have wifi!!!"
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",3 star rating,"Since the french toast from Duc de Lorraine has been circulating around social media, I figured I'd give my own input and see what this is all about. Brioche French toast, with whipped citrus ricotta, blueberry compote with maple drizzle at $16.00. The citrus infusion of the ricotta paired well with the sweetness of the blueberry compote. Unfortunately what made me a little sad was that the french toast lacked that extra crisp that La Fabrique has. Overall not disappointed, but La Fabrique still wins my heart by a million miles."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place has been iconic for French pastries for over 20 years. Sadly, not everything they make is exquisite. I have had amazing pastries in the past but I had their croissants recently and was very disappointed. Unfortunately the croissants were very soft, the layers weren't flaky enough and far from what you would expect from a reputable French bakery. Perhaps you may want to stay away from their croissants and try other items they offer. Service wise: the young lady that took our order was very nice but the host was quite unpleasant and rude. I will assume he was having a bad day..."

My parents have been bringing home pastries and cakes for as long as I can remember. Recently, I've been meeting up with a friend of the family here to pick up some freelance work from her. I had the occasion to check out the menu and pick up a wonderful strawberry cake for my parent's anniversary. The staff there is always courteous and helpful, and not saying anything when I stand around with my friend chatting for a while. The cake I purchased was filled with fresh strawberries, cream, and had a pink marzipan topping - very European. We all enjoyed it and I would purchase another cake from them for my next special occasion. The only quibble....it's a little bit expensive, even for the high quality."

Speaking of the pastries: this place is an excellent bakery. Done in a traditional French style, the bakery boasts pastries, cakes and tarts with chocolate, fruit, crème patissière, praline and many more flavours. There were at least 15 macaron varieties!I had a praline éclair and it was amazing. My mum had a lemon tart (they were out of the meringue and a few other things). My step-dad had some kind of chocolate thing (I forget!). We all stopped talking to enjoy the food. It was amazing. Seriously amazing. My favourite bakeries are all on the plateau, but for my first bakery experience in NDG, I think I know where I'll be going from now on. Also, the service was amazing"
/user_details?userid=MMNc3pupBViosmjldigDXg,Adam B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,Omg! Still waiting for food 1 hour and 30 minutes after ordering. 1245 yelp reservation. We sat 20 minutes later. And after asking many times where our food was we find out 1 hour later that they apparently lost our order.  It took 1 hour 30 minutes to get the yogurt. We would have left but visiting and no idea where to go. Go to brunch at your own risk. Food might be good don't know didn't get it yet besides the yogurt.

It looked cute, we got a table ordered soups that were over salted, then waiting for the sandwiches it never arrived. We saw our waiter only a couple of time, food was ok but service really slow. There is only one bathroom and there is always a line.In overall is a bad experience, disappointed when there is good food and places in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Went here to get three pastries for a birthday and a small coffee. Every pastry tasted Devine. The coffee was good too but prices are way too steep. 7$ plus tax for each pastry and 4$ plus tax for a regular coffee. My favorite pastry was the royale. It had a crunchy Ferrero Rocher style cookie inside and it just melted in your mouth. The meringue pie was also superb. I would skip on the opera next time. Gorgeous terrasse in front but not for this on a budget !!

/user_details?userid=pxodqdk-GelbKirvXVL_SQ,David G.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"We loved this place. Went there today for coffee and pastries. I had a Mousse Royale, husband had a Napolitaine (sp?). Both excellent. The iced coffee was the best cup of coffee I've had in a week in Quebec. (For some reason, I've had a run of terrible coffee both in Quebec City and Montreal; not sure if that's a thing or just bad luck.)I also enjoyed the classic fifties/sixties look and feel, too. Service was excellent. Prices a little on the high side but quality was high, too.It's about a five minute walk from the Cote des Neiges Metro stop. Well worth a trip if you have a couple of hours to kill."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Stopped by here when looking for a quick breakfast place in between two events in the neighborhood two weeks ago and had high expectations for this place based on previous reviews.Upon walking in, you are immediately transported to a little café in Paris. The servers are dressed to the nines, the little tables and chairs are typical of the ones you fine in various parts of France, and the general ambiance makes you completely forget that you are in Canada!We sat down and we're very surprised at the prices for simple plates like omelettes or two eggs with a side of bacon. Every menu item was priced a little ridiculously for what it was but we were hoping that this meant they were outstanding.It did not.What we got was a a very bland omelette and two sunny side up eggs with three pieces of fruit each for over $35!!! Adding to the damage, there is a counter with lots of fresh baked pastries that we wanted to try (because we thought that maybe that's where the strength of the café came in) but we were shocked when we saw the insane prices. Mille feuilles, éclairs and all other small desserts were $7-8 each (keep in mind these are $3-5 everywhere else in the city) and croissants started at $5. Nonetheless, we ordered an amandine (almond croissant) for $6 crossing our fingers that it would be the best amandine we'd ever tried but sadly, the amandine was just as bland as everything else.The prices here can be justified if the quality and taste of the food was outstanding, but that's not the case here! To be fair, the ambiance and service were great so it wasn't all bad but that's not enough to justify the prices at this place.Won't be back! :("

The local is very lovely and French looking, all the products are nicely displayed and there is a very cute dinning room and a nice patio during the summer. They offer some delicious sandwiches and pastries and it does wonders for a nice and casual lunch. The food is so good that I would give it a 5 if it was not for the not so attentive service we received on our last visit. It's not the staff was impolite, but they just seemed not motivated to work."

I love the location, the fact that there's plenty of space to sit outside and that a small green space separates the cafe from the traffic of Cote-des-Neiges st. With friends and family, we've tried the coffee, pastries, burgers! and breakfast items. The food style is somehow reminiscent of American eateries. I find it sad to confess that on multiple occasions I've been quite disappointed: the biggest blow was when we were served stale cold waffles with the unpleasant texture of congealed oil. Upon enquiry, our server said that they (a pastry shop!) won't have time to make waffles to order (or to toast them!!) and they bring it straight from the fridge! then she reluctantly offered to take it away if we don't like it. I've also had Caesar salad with soft tasteless cheese instead of (tasteful hard) parmesan!So I don't have particular plans for going back; except perhaps on a beautiful sunny summer day, to sit outside with a book and have some coffee..."

Cafe food was solid. I had the mushroom soup, which was good but came without bread or crackers. I also had the croissant, which came out of the pastry display case cold (to be fair, it was a cold day). I've also tried the grilled salmon, which came out perfectly cooked, and had an orange glaze, which was a tad too sweet for my tastes.Just come for the croissants."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I had two so much different experiences in a week time in Duc de Lorraine that I have the feeling I visited two different places. Well the location and personnel were the same. The host and waiting stuff are overall very accommodating, and the service is fine. What I had problems with is the croissant quality which was the main reason for my visit. Sunday #1. I have an important business in Côte des Neiges. It is a beautiful sunny fall day, somebody is craving croissant and Yelp told us Duc de Lorraine offers some of the best. It is indeed my first visit in this very popular French bakery. The place is packed with brunching customers, but we are seated shortly. The croissants and pain aux raisins are amazing. So good that we actually depart with two croissants for the next morning and even after almost 24 hours the croissants are as good. With the addition of two glasses of prosecco (yes, they have full bar) we definitely depart extremely happy.Sunday #2. After a long and exhausting work week I'm craving the very same croissants. Why not have coffee and croissant at the same place? Duc de Lorraine is packed again. The wait is approximately 15 minutes, that allows me to look at the new batch of croissant that are just baked and arranged behind the counter glass. They somehow look strange, lack the usual brownish color. People who came after us are seated first, that little frustration is somehow resolved as at least we are getting the table we prefer. The croissants arrive and they are the worse I have ever had. May be that would be the way my first home made batch of croissants will be if I ever decide to make them myself, they lacked fluffiness and multiple layers, the bottom was under baked dough. I actually can get better croissants in Provigo. The cappuccino was only so so. We depart not so happy. I really like Duc de Lorraine, but they lack consistency and I have no interest to go back. You can't exist based on your previous fame, if you have produced crappy batch of croissants just don't offer them to your customers. I feel really bad writing a three star review, but this is the final math after summing up my experience from Sun #1 and #2."

Having been in Paris, their pastries look and taste as if I was in a Parisian cafe. Absolutely delicious. Flaky, buttery, great quality and very reasonably priced as well. Along, with a kind and friendly staff, who is very knowledgeableI highly recommend the dark hot chocolate, made with French chocolate and tastes absolutely amazing! Their sandwiches and salads, are also outstanding.Perhaps you are wondering why a positive review and four stars? Simply and only because of the parking. Let me be upfront, parking is a nightmare! Most of the parking is only residential, or with a permit only! The VERY few spaces available, are only for 30 minutes. So what I strongly suggest is park at the St. Joseph Oratory parking lot($5) and walk 3-4 blocks to Duc de Lorraine."

The menu is evocative of a French cafe with a Canadian specialty or two added in as well. The atmosphere is cozy, and the bilingual staff are friendly and readily available. It's not only a short walk from the famous St. Joseph's Oratory, but it's also a short walk from the Métro station.

They clearly take their time, know their ingredients and know how to prepare these dishes.While there, we saw many locals from the neighborhood gathering, which was a good sign.Following lunch we were talked into trying three of their pastries, and Opera, Chocolate Eclair and an Eclair Chantilly.Along with a latte and cappucino.. they were delicious.Duc de Lorraine will definitely be on our list to visit again when we're back in Montreal.  It's a ways out of the city, but worth the trek, to be sure."

We had just spent the morning at St Joseph's Oratory and wanted to pick up some quick snacks before we started our long drive home. We stopped by Duc de Lorraine with the intention of getting some pastries to go.We were greeted right away by the attentive and friendly staff. The decor is quaint and inviting. The staff struck up a conversion and upon finding out we were leaving Montreal, convinced us to sit down for a 15-minute quick lunch.The quiche and cappuccino were delicious by themselves but the waitstaff and atmosphere made it one of our favorite memories of Montreal.We've been recommending this cafe to our my friends who plan to visit Montreal since and we can't wait to go back. If you get the chance, don't skip dining in."

After this excursion we decided to go for an impromptu meal and found this unassuming spot on the corner of the street. Upon entering the restaurant, we were met by the exquisite smell of freshly baked goods, with a delectable array of homemade cakes, pastries and other sweet treats. The large bay window on the end wall of the restaurant allowed the natural light to permeate the room, exploiting the marvellous day.The menu contained a myriad of French brunch options, such as croissants and baguettes. Three of us opted for the classic French baguette with ham and cheese. The Parisian-style baguette was the perfect texture, and the fillings did not disappoint. We then decided to order a sweet treat, I opted for the almond croissant which was a perfect finisher, and my friends who got the hot cross bun raved about it!Along with that, the service was fantastic - they were very attentive and our glasses were always kept full. All in all, Duc de Lorraine was an authentic French experience that I would highly recommend. Will definitely go back to try more from the patisserie!"

That also explains why their prices are higher than their competitors. Easily the best croissants, pastries and sandwiches you'll taste on the island of Montreal. I find they have strange hours, and have a tendancy to close early so try to aim for the middle of the day.While their pastries and baked goods are the real star items here, I also have to add that their homemade sorbets are nothing to sneeze at either."

I have often ordered Croque Monsieur, so having ordered this - at $19.00 would have expected a generous sandwich served on a bed of lettuce at least.  Sadly, my croque monsieur looked like a geriatric disabled sandwich, dry bread, old ham.. I was in the company of family who all ordered dishes priced well above acceptable pricing and were equally disappointed.  Shame on you Duc - you are no more than Paysan de Lorraine.  No more visits for me!!!"

I asked for an iced coffee or something like that (thanks for the details Pierre) Order arrived, 15 minutes later or so, and the waiter just spilled half my drink while giving it to me. So he took it back, and came back another 20 minutes later, I had finished my pastry by then, my friend had finished everything, and he only managed to spill one quarter of the drink this time.Great.Pastries are ok though, and the rest of my drink was fine.

This place is a topnotch spot to experience some of the freshest pastries, cheese, meats and pate second to Paris as one can find!..Seriously. While exploring Cote-des-Neige, my friends and I passed by this corner patisserie and was drawn in by the most incredible smells I've ever experienced. Words can not describe the assortment of edibles Duc De Lorraine had to offer, so I added a lot pictures - they are as good as they look! Staff here were incredibly friendly and hospitable. Realizing that this was out first time there, one of the staff members broke out multiple tasting of cheese and fresh bread for us to try on the house. The aged cheddar and Guinness cheese was my favorite and unlike anything I have encountered, oh soo good! Note: They have an extremely reasonable lunch special: $8C gets you a bowl of the soup du jour, 1/2 sandwich, and a drink of your choice. There is a small glass enclosed dining area in the back that has a nice view of the area. This is the perfect place to hit before heading up the hundred plus steps to L'Oratoire St. Joseph.

OK, whatever, I could deal with that if their food was worth it. But it's not! The 3 chocolate mousse cake I had was overly sweet with no depth, they should just call it the white chocolate mousse with weird gel and dry/stale biscuit base. Oh yeah and it had a hair on it. I didn't have anything else so maybe they had better offerings I didn't choose. The table next to mine got a pizza and it looked so sad. It's like a flatbread with no sauce and a random sprinkling of toppings. Definitely not the worst but I've had way better."

They moved around tables and chairs, and even made some poor guy reading a book switch seats so we could take over. I felt a bit guilty about this, but they seemed happy to make us feel welcome.We had already taken a look at the sweets inside, so we pretty much knew what we wanted. The waiter came and sat down to take our order - someone asked for a menu - he said, ""I am the menu!"" Very sweet.The macaroon I ordered was dry. Everyone else enjoyed their desserts.

The pastries aren't as good as some other places and are also more expensive, perfect example are their éclairs, they're around $5.50 and same size as every other place... so they taste better? No. Never bothered trying the other things they offer there since everything is so expensive compared to other bakery/pastry shops. Wouldn't be surprised if the other stuff was also mediocre. Moral of the story, don't believe the hype, there's better value pastry shops and bakeries in Montreal that also have better quality and tasting food. Wouldn't really recommend"

That is due not so much because it has deteriorated (it is aging well) but more due to the fact that many of the goodies it offers are now offered so many other places that the rarity factor is now gone. I can now purchase 20-30% of Duc's offerings at the supermarket or pharmacy.

Back home we don't have many bakeries near us that sell French or Italian pastries. Even the ones that do we have to travel far to such as in Boston which is almost two hours away. So in light of that, my fiance ended up picking out eight macarons: two caramel, two chocolate, two vanilla, and two raspberry. Personally my favorites were the vanilla and raspberry which both had a great flavor/texture. I found that the caramel macarons wanted to literally melt on me so I had to eat them rather quickly. My fiance, instead of eating my treats, ended up getting an eclair for himself which he enjoyed. I personally didn't go inside the shop so I can't comment on the overall condition. What I can say is that my macarons were awesome and probably some of the best I've had! We will definitely be coming back here again when we visit Montreal in the future."

My recommendation - don't sit outside on the street cafe, unless you enjoy burning money.  My wife and I went to Duc De Lorraine twice during a recent trip to Montreal. The first time we were walking by and decided to go in for a look. My wife bought a bag of day old chocolate almond croissants from the bakery by the register. They were so good even as day olds, that we decided to return for another visit a few days later. On the second visit, I went inside to buy a few items. As it was near lunchtime, so I was going to buy a veggie pizza for us to split, and 2 chocolate almond croissants for dessert. The prices are easy to see in the display case by the items. The young lady working behind the counter said, we can bring them out to you if you want to sit outside. As it was a beautiful day, we decided to sit for a while and here is where our visit starts to take a twist. The waiter came, he was great, very friendly, sat with us to take our order, but he never gave us a menu (remember, if you see no menu, you see no  prices). Like another reviewer said the waiters ARE the menu. They help you figure out what you want to eat and drink.  OK, no problem,  as I had just been inside and I saw the items that I wanted to purchase.  We ordered 2 coffee's, one veggie pizza, 2 chocolate almond croissants, and my wife got a basic green salad. All food items were delicious, but when the bill came the prices were significantly higher than the prices I had seen inside in the bakery display cases! The Pizza was approximately 3 dollars more, and the croissant prices were close to double the inside display case price. Now, add on your friendly waiter's tip (who has become your best buddy and told you his life story), and a significant Canadian tax to your inflated bill just for fun!  I said to the waiter, ""there must be a mistake, because these are not the prices I saw inside"", and he said ""the bill is correct, these are the outside prices"".  What???, Say WHAT again??? The outside prices?  The price changed when you carried them out to me? Maybe they have a webcam hidden outside so they can watch the reactions of people getting the bill?  I paid the bill and was still in disbelief, so I went inside and found the young lady that I had talked to initially and she confirmed, Yes, the outside cafe prices ARE higher than the inside ""take away"" prices (FOR THE EXACT SAME ITEMS!). Is this a French thing? Are we in Paris France?  I guess you could think of it as paying rent for sitting in their space, because they do not rush you and you could probably stay there all day and people watch if you wanted to.  When I am back in Montreal we will return to Duc De Lorraine for the great croissants, but I will buy them inside and find a nice outdoor spot over by the Oratory to enjoy them."
