Due to all the restos being closed again I tried Bar George's Uber eats. IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! Ordered the beef Wellington, arrived hot and cooked to perfection. Also ordered the chicken curry. Amazing! Chicken was sooo juicy and tender and flavourful. I will definitely be ordering Uber eats from Bar George again."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This review is based on their brunch service. I was very happy to know they offer breakfast, brunch and dinner every day during the holidays and take reservations for all of them! They were very kind over the phone and helpful.The service from the moment we were greeted to the moment we left was above and beyond. We always had our coffee full and never had to wait long for anything. The dining room itself is also extraordinary, it's very cozy yet elegant. Although there isn't a dress code, you'll want to put in a little bit of effort to feel like you are worthy of the space.The brunch menu is extensive and offers a lot of classic as well as exotic brunch options. It ranges from oatmeal and poached eggs to smoked haddock hash and beetroot salad. I had the ""American breakfast"" which comes with eggs, bacon, potatoes and bread. The potatoes were really amazing and I recommend ordering a dish with these. They are cooked in herbs and duck fat which really make them stand out. The bread that came with the dish was very dry and underwhelming compared to the rest of the food. Everyone enjoyed their meals but I find it lacks a bit compared to their service and ambiance. I've been here for dinner and I find the food is much better so maybe my expectations were a little too high."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"My mother really wanted to try this place because a reviewer had said it gave Downtown Abbey vibes. I will say, they were right, even though I've only seen 1/4 of one Downtown Abbey episode. The place is indeed very fancy inside, but their terrace isn't the same vibe. I think this place is great when you wanna have a warm meal and it's cold outisde and you can bundle up inside and there's a nice fire going, but during the summer it's too dark to eat inside and it's too warm to get something to eat that's hot so you end up eating outside and it's nice but just ok. This is just my opinion though. We went on a tuesday night and I made a reservation for 4. No problem getting seated and in my reversation (online) I mentioned it was my mother's birthday and they were kind enough to give her a surprise piece of cake. We ate on the terrace because there was a light breeze and it was a beautiful evening. I ordered the tartare as an entree and the steak as my meal. I found the tartare just meh but the steak was well cooked. The service is good but we were left waiting at some times. The highlight to me was the dessert they brought out. It said happy birthday on it and it was some sort of meringue cake that the waitress lit on fire and it looked very cool. It was, coincidentally, the exact dessert my mother had her eye on (I had not asked beforehand what kind of surprise I wanted for my mother). Although this place didn't impress me, my mother really enjoyed it and that's what counts to me. I'll take her to brunch here next time."
/user_details?userid=jtx0pnIDrn5f1EGMQ9jjDQ,Penelope M.,"Fanwood, NJ",4 star rating,"We stayed in Le Mount Stephen hotel while in Montreal,  so we must try Bar George.  A Victorian mansion turned into an elegant restaurant. I learned about Lord George Stephen who lived in this mansion in the 1800's. His story is just as interesting as this historical place connected to one of the most modern hotels I've been to. Onto to the food. Brunch. Omelette Forestière. Me: omelette forestière, please.Waitress: do you eat bacon?Me: yes        Is lardon, bacon?Waitress: that's why I askI don't think she liked us, but it was the most impressive omelette - how can this delicate and fluffy beaten eggs, able to encase diced laardons and mushrooms without falling apart? Beautiful and delicious! And the cubed potatoes fried in duck fat was the ultimate best; some smaller pieces were burnt,  I admit, yet still scrumptiously edible. The scone? Stale. Lord Stephen would have been embarrassed."
/user_details?userid=iquCZU8tjmRQrnDgci5YpQ,Cori C.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"It can be a challenge to find a nice bar near the train station. Yes, there are many places near Bonaventure and along Crescent Street, but if you're taking the train for the last vestiges of that blink-and-you-miss-it era where you could travel while maintaining your dignity, perhaps you'd also like something that doesn't feel like a mall food court or a frat party.Bar George may be busy at prime times, but in those in-between afternoons the bar is quiet and lovely and the perfect spot for a drink and a snack.The space is gorgeous. The service is fantastic, if a little slow. Coming here for a proper meal is pricey, but drink prices are pretty standard and there is a small menu of bar snacks.Plus, hands-down the nicest bathrooms around."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Before even broaching the subject of food quality, the decor at Bar George deserves recognition in its own right. Walking into the main dining room, one is struck by the dark wood paneling, intricate ceiling and mouldings, majestic artwork hanging on the walls, and the throne-like chairs guests sit upon to dine. There are precious few restaurants like this in this city. You feel like you are dining in the once glorious Oak Room in NYC. Just sitting here with a drink would be impressive enough. Fortunately, my wife and I ordered a whole lot more than just a drink.Full disclosure: We were here courtesy of an all inclusive gift certificate won at a charity auction. Therefore, we only paid for our drinks and gratuity. We squeezed that gift certificate for all it was worth!The meal started with comforting warm cheese rolls served with butter. We then split an order of the Welsh rarebit toast which is essentially an open faced, savoury grilled cheese creation. For those of us uninitiated in this dish, it does NOT contain rabbit or meat of any kind. It just sounds like it does. I think it is mixed with mustard, egg, and cheddar. Whatever the ingredients, it was delicious. Now I feel like I have to order this every time I see it on a menu. My wife had a very pretty plate of tuna crudo with grapefruit while I opted for the chef's special of the day: Foie gras flambé with pineapple. You know it's going to be a good night anytime a waiter is going to casually set fire to food at a table. I'm not sure which spirit was used for the flambé (possibly brandy), but the result was a large and perfectly creamy lobe of seared foie gras paired with sweet confit pineapple. We're talking about my happy place here.For my main, I opted for the enormous veal chop smothered in a thick layer of blue cheese and whisky sauce. Served with a Yorkshire pudding, this dish is for experienced eaters only. Each bite felt like I was committing a mortal sin. The meat was cooked to a juicy medium rare. Just like the decor, the chop was unapologetically grand and ornate. My wife had the black cod with mussels and clams. Of the small bite I sampled, the dish tasted incredibly fresh and was seasoned lightly in order to allow the fish and seafood to shine. My compliments to the chef who proved that he/she can prepare both heavy and light dishes with equal ease and mastery.For dessert we opted to share the baked Alaska for 2. First of all, it's baked Alaska; a dish you haven't seen on a menu for a very long time. It's basically ice cream and cake encased in meringue. Secondly, the dish is flambéed table-side. You want to set fire to my food TWICE during the same meal?? Count me in! Dessert was delicious, the wine was flowing, and my head was spinning in the best possible way from the rich food and the opulent atmosphere. Service was extremely attentive and doting throughout the evening. This place knocked it out of the park for me and my wife and we cannot wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=fdOuKZghNqoaA-Z8kn7_qQ,Jamie Y.,"Irving, TX",4 star rating,"We had breakfast at Bar George while in Montreal. The décor of the restaurant is stunning and so is the hotel itself. We made a reservation before we went, and we were seated at the best seat of the house (in front of the fire place with stained glasses). My husband and I never had English style breakfast before, so we ordered Full English breakfast and chia seed bowl. We both really enjoyed the food! We were a little surprised by one of the item on our breakfast plate, which is called black pudding. (If you don't know what black pudding is - it's pork blood sausage.) They make their own black pudding there, and some people even visit Bar George just for that, according to our waitress. Apparently it is a delicacy in Britain. Learn something new everyday!We had great time and great food at Bar George. I would love to visit again for dinner."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This rating is for brunch. I'd like to think I've been unlucky and would give it another shot, but my experience was subpar in terms of food and service. - Poached eggs & avocado toast: soggy toast, cold eggs (perfectly cooked however), the avocado was more like a guacamole, some sweet spread was underneath the toast and I believe it didn't combine well at all taste-wise. Strongly recommend not to order this dish. - Scone: heavy, neutral, uninteresting - 'Fresh' orange juice: wasn't freshly squeezed, disappointing for such a place. Pretty sure it was Tropicana. Expected more. The potatoes and smoked haddock looked good. I'll try that next time with coffee instead! The service was painfully slow. Price is 10$ too expensive per person (around 30$ each). I guess it's because of location. The place was good looking. Wish everything else was up to par."
/user_details?userid=J84FICbDVoSe7ZXn5lnQNw,Cameron S.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Lovely ambiance at this historic building. Service was solid, however a bit tardy. Our waiter switched mid meal for some reason. Eating dinner at a later hour during an apparent shift change may have played a role. I personally ordered the Beef Wellington. Overall the food was solid and the location was very cool."
/user_details?userid=5xxI2JMKSyPNCLpXOgPaig,Chad V.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",5 star rating,Five stars for pure ambiance! A century old mansion in the middle of Montreal. Take note of the intricately carved woodwork all around and remark about how beautifully polished it is. It's an amazing space that is incredibly rare and the atmosphere is modern yet old world. I'd be equally comfortable taking a date I want to impress or a business contact. I'll be back next time on Montréal.
/user_details?userid=i1QjdNtqBUX8s9uTsiAHmA,Andres R.,"Centerville, MA",4 star rating,"Unusual restaurant in the heart of Montréal, offering British cuisine. We enjoyed our table next to a fireplace as requested in our reservation.  Our waitress was cheerful, knowledgeable, and gave us excellent service throughout our experience.  The cocktails and appetizers were delicious, and we shared the beef Wellington, a house specialty, and a wonderful salad.  My only disappointment was the size of the portions, more akin to those of a crusty french restaurant than the heartier meals you usually find in British restaurants."
/user_details?userid=XFR4tfX0LFE079es_FlQzA,Lu H.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Gorgeous restaurant inside the Mount Stephen hotel. We arrived on a rainy day around 12:30 for lunch. Took the hostess awhile to get back to the front desk, not sure where she was exactly, but after she saw us, she checked out umbrellas, and seated us promptly. The interior was Renaissance-style, so is the hotel entrance, as it was converted from an old mansion. All the paintings and chandeliers and doors make us feel like we stepped back in time to 19th century. Lunch menu wasn't extensive, but everything looked delicious. We got the cream of mushroom soup, sea bass, and cod cake, the husband also got an old fashioned. Per him, the drink was a little watery. For food, the mushroom soup was creamy and full of flavors. Sea bass was cooked perfectly, and complimented by the sauce. I don't think I've had a cod cake before, so I can easily say this is the best cod cake I've had. Inside was very moist, with lots of cod. Vegetables on the plate provided the right amount of contrast. Service was friendly and very accommodating as we have a one-year old. Towards the end it was a little slower, and we had to wave someone down to get our check. But hey, most people don't feel rushed to get out of a place like this, unless you have a baby who can't sit still. :)"
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So I randomly discovered this place thanks to Yelp and I really did not expect it to be in a beautiful ""heritage landmark"" kind of building which is also a hotel.Service: the waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, 5 stars there.Ambiance and decor: the main reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the decor. The interior design is just outstanding, I feel like I went back in time and entered an old French mansion. It is such a gem.Food: the food however was not that impressive. I went for brunch and ordered the Benedict eggs. I did not particularly enjoy the eggs nor the hollandaise sauce, and it was pricy for what was offered. However, I do not mind paying the price just for the beautiful surroundings.Would come back and do recommend."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the kind of place that you wish you could give a rating of 5*.The ambiance is fantastic...old rustic British decoration.I'll start by saying that the food is fantastic. I took the Full English George which has 2 eggs, ham, beans, black pudding, saucisse and bread. From the description, you would think that you will be stuff and feel sick after such a plate like when you get out of Ben & Florentine or similar. But to my surprise, portions were not too big given the number of items and the taste was great. The black pudding was one of the best I have tasted. My bf hates black pudding and he even approved it. The beans were also very nicely done.Our table each ordered a coffee and to our surprise, we were all disappointed. You would think that this kind of place would serve you nothing but perfection. However, it wasn't the case. The coffee had such a light colour that you would think the person forgot to change the coffee before brewing again. The taste of the coffee also confirmed my assumption. We asked our waitress and she said that the coffee was freshly made and that was the kind of coffee they serve. Either I really don't know my coffee or they serve crappy coffee...you can be the judge on that one and let me know.Service was also extremely slow and the waitress didn't know all the items on the menu. When asked about a specific item, she said she didn't know and had to go ask.Go there for the ambiance and the food. If you are not in a rush and is not there on a completely empty stomach, you should be fine."

A lovely Victorian Mansion turned into a business with service to match.    I came in to get a drink and was taken away by the beauty of this place. They have creative seating areas, an old bar, eccentric rooms, a great drink menu, and a great place to people watch.  I visited Bar George on a cold November night and this bar took me in, gave me a good drink, and warmed me up.  This building also provided dinning which is by reservation and hotel accommodations.  Loved the music they were playing at the bar and ambiance, I could have stayed all night. Would love to have another drink here when I come to Montreal again."

I went there last Friday night to celebrate my birthday with a couple of friends. Everyone was amazed by the excellent service received by the entire staff. Starting with Alex who took my reservation in the most welcoming and kind way. The manager always passing by too check if everything is okay. Our waitress Kate, beyond amazing. Thank you. Now let's talk about the food, my favourite part! Exquisite dishes. Well cooked, nice presentation. I've I mentioned it was great? Yeah a billion!Now I don't regret a minute the choice I made. This year was the most memorable birthday I ever had. I totally recommend this place. Thumbs up... naaaah!!! Both hands up!"

It was smokey and matched well with the potatoes and poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The dishes on the menu were all around 20$ and all looked delicious. The service is fast and the waiters were very friendly. The place is clean and had an old fancy vibe to it. Would definitely come back."

The food was great. I had the salmon eggs Benedict. The wait staff was super attentive and knowledgeable. And the ambience is amazing! This is one of the fanciest breakfast places I've ever been. And I totally stumbled upon it. Pricey but it's worth it.
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Whatta treat!My brother and I visited Bar George for lunch this week and were delighted. As others have mentioned the décor and general environment are exceptional- I don't think I can think of another accessibly old-school fancy establishment in Montreal that would have me so tickled pink.I definitely get why these guys have a reputation with their cocktails. The white lady I ordered was perfectly balanced (normally I find the Cointreau overpowering in cocktails like that, not this time). My brother also found his drink fantastic.For food, we both ordered the duck confit cottage pie which was delicious. I will critique however that it's a big strange to have such a hearty stew on the lunch menu during heat wave season. That being said, we both loved it- we just weren't as able to polish off our plates as thoroughly as in the colder seasons.I actually found the lunch prices, considering where we're talking, were decent. Bearing in mind the service, quality and environment I think it's worth the visit."

But the food is so delicious...I rank it honestly better than Joe Beef which was a disappointment.  Mushroom soup and chips with curry were some of our favs!Ambiance:  you cannot beat this ambiance.  All of the beautiful wood, stain glass, paintings...such an amazing experience, so much to look at - romantic, chic, fun all wrapped into one beautiful place.Thank you bar George for a great evening!

Well worth a look around - the staff are generous and friendly with letting you explore!The food itself is a smallish menu, but pleasant enough for a nice brunch. I was a little disappointed with the black pudding (far too soft!) but everything else was very nice, and not as expensive as the décor implied. A lovely place to take visiting British people who are missing a taste of home (like me!)"

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Bar George- for anyone who has attended McGill, this building resembles one of the many faculty clubs owned by the University. It screams McGill even though it's part of a hotel. I came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch.Walking in the bar is located on the left, the main dining hall is straight a head, followed by the hotel entrance on the right. The decor is beautiful- classic and hand carved wooden ceilings decked with chandeliers. I won't like lie- the dining hall is very dark. It almost a feels you're part of Harry Potter's dining Hall and I magically need a wand to  light the place up. I wouldn't have picked this venue for summer- too dreary.The menu is simple yet overpriced. I ordered the avocado toast for around 20$ that is a popular dish reading from yelp. I'm south Asian and this dish did not settle well in my mouth - chutney on avacado toast doesn't make it fancy people! To wash out the aftertaste I thought a 5$ freshly squeezed juice would do the trick. To my surprise - the portion of the juice is what you get in a happy meal. For a Virgin drink - Let's be nice Bar George and serve bigger portions! Although, the side order of buttermilk scones for 4$ was totally worth the price if not more as it is served with a variety of fruit spreads.My bill came out to 27$ for 3 dishes. I was hoping for a better brunch menu for the price I paid, but maybe a dinner soiree will have prove me wrong."

The service was amazing they have a lot of staff who always made sure that I had water, coffee and tea. As well asked if I liked the food. They made some options on the menu Vegan for me. I chose the avocado toast it had a great relish under which gave it a nice taste to it. The service was also very fast from the kitchen. They have a great Americans and with the tea they have a full pot not just a cup ! They have beautiful washrooms, parking is on the street which is free on Sundays. The only downfall with the price for a tea, coffee and two avocado toast was $30 which included the tip. It wasn't horrible but a tad high. But you get your money's worth here. Check it out for a fancy occasion."

/user_details?userid=S3nCmgSpJmsThVwAcf9Opw,Kristine D.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Bar George gets 5 stars because of the whole experience. First, I enjoyed the look and energy of the space. It felt like we were dining in an old mansion. For the food, we started with the octopus, foie gras, and croquettes. They were all excellent. The octopus was cooked well, the foie was so tasty especially with the black pudding, and the croquettes were a nice combo of flavors (also had black pudding!). For mains, I ordered the beef wellington, my husband had the veal chop, my dad ordered the steak frites, and my mom had the salmon. The beef was excellent! The beef was perfectly cooked and the dough was the perfect crispy-chewy balance. Everything came together so nicely. The service was above and beyond. The staff were extremely attentive and thoughtful. The manager even came over a few times to check in with us. What I enjoyed most was that they gave my toddler a little red bear since they noticed her other toy/pacifier was also red. While I imagine they give most kids this little toy, I appreciated their attention to detail and thoughtfulness. We will be dining at Bar George again !"

I live within 5 minute walk from here so I find myself at this bar probably too often but I love the atmosphere, the impeccable service, their drinks and the food! They make good cocktails and I like their pimm's cup. I've also tried several items from their appetizer menu such as the oysters, steak tartare, octopus salad and tuna crudo. The tuna crudo was to die for! Amazing flavours and fresh ingredients. Portion is a bit small iverall for the price but it really is amazing. I would strongly recommend the tuna crudo!"
/user_details?userid=8h1r7mXd-H225yDgc4EMPg,Sarah A.,"Pawtucket, RI",4 star rating,"This place is seriously incredible! The atmosphere/ interior/ decor alone is worth going, to say nothing of the yummy food. Make sure to leave some time to take some photos outside before going in for your reservation. When we visited two weeks ago, there were beautiful flower arrangements out front and there's the also gorgeous exterior of this old mansion to take it. It's conveniently located right off of Saint Catherine and is close to the Peel Metro stop. I'll let the decor speak for itself in the photos. We had requested a table near a fireplace and we were very happy to be seated literally right in front of a fireplace. Of course, it was not operational (summer and all) but the vibe was very cool. Our booth also included a number of plush velvet cushions and we really felt like royalty. The cocktails did not disappoint at all! Really great combinations of flavors. I wish I had taken a picture of the menu because I can't remember the cocktail I had but it was named after one of George's wives. We started with the heirloom tomato salad, also enjoyed some foie gras which was served on fire, and shared a beef Wellington. I am super obsessed with beef Wellington and that was my main reason for coming here. While all the food was delicious, we did find the portions to be a little small. It wasn't a big deal since we totally gorged the prior night on poutine, but I would caution others dining here to expect smallish portions. Service was really great throughout our meal but when it came time to pay, we had to wait a really long time for our server to cash us out, which cut down on the time we otherwise could have been out and about enjoying an evening in MTL. The only other detracting comment I have is that they seem to microwave the rolls and the second batch we had with our meal was definitely over-microwaved. One I couldn't even finish. Not very nice for an otherwise fine dining establishment. Expect to shell out some serious $ for the food and drinks. If you want to just come and check out the atmosphere, come for a drink at the bar and maybe an app. I'd definitely come back for the beef Wellington, however. Final tip: do not leave before you check out the bathrooms! Faucets of gold, chandeliers, so fancy, oh my!"

I ordered the roasted cauliflower salad with spinach vinaigrette which was today's special. Then I had salmon gravlax with crumpet, on the side a perfect Pinot Grigio. Each bite of my food was simply amazingly delicious. The portions were perfect. I didn't feel over bloated, that I actually had space for a little desert (whiskey pudding) and a latte. It was another delish dish! It is slightly over priced but you know the quality is far superior, and each presentation of each dish was breathtaking. I can't wait to go back again!"

I hadn't realized that Bar George was a restaurant in a hotel until we got there but don't let that deter you. Firstly, the hotel and restaurant are beautiful. When you enter there is an ornate wooden staircase which was perfect for Christmas day post dinner pictures. The entry was also beautifully decorated for the holiday. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly and very helpful, especially regarding the menu. The food was fantastic. We all started our with cocktails that were a twist on traditional English drinks. As a gin lover I really appreciated the cocktail selection. Our server suggested the scallops with blood pudding ravioli which was delicious, I would definitely recommend this dish. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered for dinner and we got three desserts to share. We got the George's mess which is their play on Eton Mess, the pumpkin pie, and the whiskey chocolate cake. I had wished the George's mess had more meringue but all the desserts were rich and delightful. I would definitely recommend Bar George to visitors of a Montreal."

We had lunch in a separate room, private and intimate and were very pleased with every aspect.The first dish, the tuna crudo was amazing in texture and taste. Only the raw radish were off putting with the champagne tasting we had. It's just not fitted for wine in general.Then we had a seared sea scallop with black pudding and cauliflower cream. It may seem like an odd mix. However, the cauliflower and black pudding were so delicate and creamy that it worked perfectly.We then had a grilled veal chop with blue cheese, whisky sauce. It was brought on a service plate and separated in portion by the table. Again, lovely and perfectly executed both from a cuisine perspective or the service of it.Last but not least, george's mess. A white choco chantilly with berries was to die for. Just the softness and texture of the chantilly is worth coming. I' m not kidding.Overall, it may seem pompous from the outside, but don't let this stop you from an amazing experience."

Housed inside of a hotel that seems to have once been a palace inhabited by royals, Bar George will initially impress and inspire awe in visitors.I am not a fan of giving three stars, especially given the fact that by the time we left, a sour first impression from a female bartender had been rectified by good customer service from other staff working the floor. But first impressions are everything and all I can think about is the condescending bartender juxtaposed with the stunning environs and three stars is where I sit at this time.It was a Saturday night and the place was packed, so packed that getting a bartender's attention seemed a fruitless effort. If I hadn't been so enamoured with the place, believe me, I would have wanted out of there ASAP. My guy got up to the bar while I scoped out a place to sit. The only table available had a ""reserved"" sign on it. Who knew that they took reservations in the bar area, and it certainly didn't appear that way as there was no hostess to be found, but OK. Meanwhile, my guy ordered our drinks and I got back to the bar to see the bartender making a face as she reluctantly poured our drinks. ""What the hell did you order?"" I asked, wondering if he ordered a piña colada or some other annoying drink that no bartender wants to make, especially when it's this crowded (note: this is not the bar to even think about ordering such a concoction). He told me that he had asked her first if they had Mezcal, to which she answered, ""yes,"" and then he asked if they had sparkling wine, to which she answered, ""yes"" in a tone that implied he was an idiot for asking. And then she just stared at him instead of, you know, doing her job and giving details as to what they actually have as far as Mezcal and sparkling wine. It was odd and incredibly uncomfortable, but he ordered a Mezcal on the rocks and a sparkling wine. We took our drinks past the crowd to a small hallway where there were miraculously two chairs and sat down. Within minutes, a really nice server came over and offered us a stool so we had somewhere to place our drinks. A little while after that, another server came by to see if we wanted another round. Like I said, this rectified the earlier situation and I ended up enjoying my time in this jewel box of a lounge. I'm hoping this was just an isolated incident, so I (hesitantly) do recommend The George and would also consider going back to try their food as I spied a couple veg options on the menu."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"A must stop if you visit Montréal - even if it is just for a drink. Bar George is a downtown Montréal restaurant and bar serving Scottish and British cuisine with a decidedly Québécois twist, alongside classic English drinks that are high octane and served in possibly the most beautiful building in all of Montréal. ​The name is a nod to the fact that this ""home"" (by that I mean mansion/complex) once belonging to Sir George Stephen which has since been transformed into a boutique hotel I wish I would have booked at least one night at during my trip. As for the restaurant​, Chefs Anthony Walsh and Kevin Ramasawmy seem to effortlessly tie established​ U.K. cuisine​, contemporary​ Québécois flavors along with upper class​, homegrown components​ in a menu​ that features everything from Scotch Eggs to a Butler's Steak - all at very reasonable price points considering the environs and locale. The service is top notch to boot. I just updated the star count to 5 while thinking about it. Few restaurants can check all of the boxes Bar George does on a whim. I opted for the BG Club Sandwich & Chips which is a superlative to that Club you are accustomed to at the local Golf Course or greasy spoon. How so? Glad you asked. For one, Bar George utilizes Cornish Game Hen as the poultry and Toronto Bacon (I don't personally know how Toronto Bacon differs from any other, but it was important enough for the waiter to mention). The customary Tomato, Lettuce, and White Toasted Bread are all in the starting line up along with a Piccalilli Mayonnaise to put the finishing touch on a superb sandwich. Most certainly worth the $19.00 (CAN) price of admission. The best part happens once you finish your sublime meal. Look around a bit and tell me that I am wrong; It is a free museum​ tour. Have a libation in hand for best results."

I made a same day online reservation and came here for brunch on a Saturday. The decor is very Victorian and nestled inside of a trendy hotel. I got the poached eggs with avocado toast. My toast was a bit hard but the avocado was fresh and the egg yolk melted into the meal. The Benedictine eggs my fiance got were superb! The crumpet they were on was soft and the bacon brought the meal together. We went to the next room afterwards for drinks at their bar. I didn't want a regular drink off the menu and asked for ""something that tastes mild but is strong."" The bartender knew just what specialty drink to concoct! He was super friendly and knowledable about the local sites too. The place also allows customers to walk around the first and 2nd floors to see the different Victorian rooms and dining venues, providing a blast from the past. A must when in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Eating at Bar George makes me feel so distinguished.  The dining room features ornate wooden ceilings and comfortable seating.  It feels very high class and almost like something out of a movie.  It fills up at brunch time so you would be wise to make a reservation. I have eaten here twice now for brunch.  Both times the whole experience was okay but it didn't blow my mind.  On my most recent visit I had a haddock hash which was so salty that it drowned out the other flavours in the dish.  The time before that I had an omelette which was alright though the duck fat potatoes were delicious.There was a hiccup or two with the service but I feel that they were honest mistakes because the experience as a whole was quite up to par.  In fact the host was incredibly welcoming.  The waitress did forget to bring the coffee I ordered but she rebounded and the rest of the service was fine.  It is a bit expensive for brunch but once in a while you could justify the expense.  Having experienced Bar George at brunch I would like to come back at dinner time to see how it compares.  In this part of town it is one of the better brunch options around but I do think that there is room for improvement.

A bit expensive. Friendly service.VERDICT: I recommend if you are looking for a classier and clean restaurant.My friends and I ordered the scotch egg and beets salad. Both were good. I had never tried a scotch egg before and it was definitely interesting. The meat surrounding the egg was seasoned well but had too much breading for me. However, I did like the crispy bite of the meat encasing the velvety egg. The beets salad was refreshing and tossed in a light vinaigrette. Had a much needed acidity to the overall meal. It was a great contrast against the savoury scotch egg.Our server was so friendly and sweet. He was really attentive and made sure that all our needs were met. We did not have a reservation but he seated us immediately despite the lunch wave that was about to come through."

Its absolutely gorgeous the decor and classic feel to this place. We tried the food menu a couple of times and honestly it's not my jam so this place is on our list for a night out of drinking! The bar area Is so classy and they have a really nice selection of alcohol! However last night was a funny altercation with one of the employees and honestly I'm really shocked and annoyed by this. I would like to add that I am not here to talk bad about a restaurant however I think the lack of respect was completely out of line here..We come here often .. and I never expect a royal treatment however I do expect a proper service and we always get it from the staff they are always extremely polite and attentive to the service they provide... Last night a friend of mine and myself decided to come to bar George for a little bite and some drinks.. we went to the bar area and sat on the chairs they have by the side of the bar.. we ordered our drinks and some small food to share.. so the waitress brought as a second table so we have room to eat and place our plates and drinks super accommodating right?? Absolutely!! Now at this point we have our plates and food on this table that she brought for us and at the same we had a very small table next to us with our drinks and some more food.. all of a sudden this guy comes up to us and says ""do you mind , I'm going to take this table because we are alot of people and I need it"" keep in mind we have our things on the table so we both looked at him and said "" yes we mind we are clearly using this table"" so he looked over and said you can use the other one!!! So we basically told him NO. He got verry annoyed and called over his waitress and said ""bring me another table because they dont want to give it to me""....like a child Then i realized that this guy looks extremely familiar and wanna know who this douche bag is? Excuse my languag.. he is the exucitive chef of the restaurant HA!!!! Isn't that amazing??? Guys.. I'm sorry but that is not okay!! This dude needs a reality check and to humble the fuck down. Never in my 12 years of experience working in the food industry  have I ever witness the exucitive chef do this to his customers in the restaurant!! If you needed an extra Tiny table then take your party to another room or a bigger table and dont bother your clients!! Because clearly you're not a client here! I am still so shocked that he assumed we would just say yes. What kind of service is this? Its honestly so ugly and a really bad attitude to have. Just to give you an idea of how small the table he was referring to for us to use was so small our plates didn't fit! I have no words but to say your exucitive chef is an exucitive douche bag."

The coat check and host were very friendly and welcoming. However, we ended up standing at the bar for 20 minutes with no acknowledgement from any of the three bartenders. I got us a couple menus from another guest after the first 5 minutes. After 15 minutes, the host walked in and asked if we needed a menu, I declined and asked if one of the waitresses could take our order since the bartenders were far too engrossed in a personal conversation with the guest in front of us to take our order. Unfortunately after 20 minutes my girlfriend and friend were over it. We had nothing but good experiences other spots in Montreal that weekend (Tiraditu, Bar Furco, Pullman, Bartizen, etc.) so we decided to head elsewhere. The host was apologetic and looked uncomfortable with the situation but it was obviously not in his control.

Bar George ticked all he boxes.The place was about half full on a Tuesday lunchtime and the three staff members were all attentive. Lauren our main server had oodles of personality and was chatty in a really good way. She plainly liked her job but after chatting we learned that she had ambition to continue her education at a serious level. For a science graduate she had great knowledge of food, wine and road building! In a nutshell she was a great server and a 'people person'.Our lunch of scotch egg (11/10) club sandwich (10/10) calves liver (9/10) was delicious but the whisky pudding to finish it off was too sweet for me (8/10) but not for my partner ; the sour cream ice cream it was topped with was excellent. Wine was pricey and a glass of admittedly very good premier crus pink bubbly at $30 was too indulgent, but tasty non the less. My local red ale at $8 seemed much better value.As other folks have mentioned the bar and restaurant area has an amazing setting and for a special ambiance in Montreal I doubt that it can be beaten.Finally the test of a good eatery...the humble chip (well I'm British and so is the restaurant) the last one was as good as the first and also still crisp.

Bar George's restaurant is the depiction of customer service excellence. When guests left the table, they would return finding their napkins folded, and entrees covered to retain the heat. Recommendations were provided which we followed without regrets. We had the table by the dining room door, from which you can feel the breeze coming from the main door. Without asking, the host noticed we were chilly and closed it right away. From a food perspective, I wouldn't recommend the fries which aren't particularly unique, but everything else on the apps or entree list was incredible, my favorite being the Steak du Majordome. Make sure you keep room for dessert, you can't miss out on the Profiteroles, which are artistically presented. Highly recommended !"

I picked Bar George based on the reviews, location, and the fact we were able to make a reservation at such a weird hour - I know a reservation isn't necessary at 4pm on a Tuesday, but we had a Canadian Senator coming and wanted everything locked down, if only for our own anxiety. I got there a bit before my guests and was delighted by the spectacularly beautiful room and the perfect, warm service. And then I found out that, very reasonably, we were between the lunch and dinner menus and would only be able to order from the Bar Bites. There were lots of delicious sounding options, but nothing vegetarian at all - everything had fish or meat - except for the French fries, but we needed something substantial before our event! Yikes! I asked about vegetarian options, and told the waitress my concern. She said, I think I saw on your reservation you are coming with a Senator? In that case, if she needs something that's not on the menu, we'll hook her up. Which was super nice. And I'm glad to know they can accommodate powerful people.... But but but. True class and high level hospitality is treating everyone at that high level. Anyway. I ate the curried fish on crumpets, and the cheese on the Ploughman Platter and they were totally freaking delicious. I loved the service from every single person I interacted with, and as the bar started to fill up with 5a7 crowd I got the impression this could be a really fun, classy place to come for drinks if you want to feel fabulous. And the lunch and dinner menus have salads and other vegetarian options I think, so no stress. Just a moment that left me thinking about how class can determine access to healthy, sustainable options... and a Yelp review seemed an appropriate place to share. ;)"

It's inside the Mount Stephen hotel, a boutique hotel in a restored historic building. I decided to stop by for breakfast. The first thing that strikes you is the space itself. The wood-panelled walls, plush carpet and hardwood floors, and marble countertops evoke the grand hotels of a century ago. You have the option of eating either in the dining room or at the bar. I chose the bar for the more open space and brighter lighting, since I was there for breakfast. The menu is simple and well-curated. Given the British pub theme, they have the usual suspects, along with the full English breakfast. I opted for the omelette forestière, with mushrooms, lardons, spinach, Emmental, and duck fat potatoes, along with a side of their breakfast sausage. I was seriously impressed with everything. The omelette was properly executed, not overcooked, and the filling was the right mix of crispy and gooey. The duck fat potatoes were excellent, with a slightly crisp, caramelized outside encasing a creamy interior. The sausages seemed house made, and had a nice herbal seasoning to them. Service-wise, business was slow when I was there, and even though the staff was taking advantage of the down time to prepare for the lunch and dinner rushes later that day, they were friendly and attentive. I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit for dinner soon."

The exterior and interior are absolutely beautiful so we were excited for the experience we were about to have. The food is fresh and each plate has such a great balance of flavors. We first came for lunch and loved it so much that we made dinner reservations for the next evening. Do yourself a favor, whether it's just to stop by for a drink or have meal, you won't regret your visit to Bar George."

The food is always tasty, presented nicely, and at a reasonable price. Drinks I find are a bit expensive, better suited for a peaceful cozy evening outing rather than a drunk night! Servers are almost always attentive, kind and helpful. I've been to bar george a few times. For a lunch date, for drinks and snacks with friends, and for lunch with colleagues and so far everyone has enjoyed the bldg, the ambience and the food.The food is not quite 5star, but the settings add a magical character to this place that is worth more than 1 extra star :)"

This place is in the heart of downtown. It used to be a private club that went bankrupt. It looks like a classy old British bank. For appetizers we got tuna crudo and cauliflower salad. Both with delicious and full of flavor but small. Then we got the beet salad cuz we were still hungry. It was also good. For mains we got the strip sirloin which was a special that day and the butlers steak. Both were good. The butlers steak was a little salty and comes with fries. The food was served very fast. The service was exceptional!

There is a large bar as well, and small tables by the window in the same room as the bar. There is also a patio. We received superb, 5-star service there. Our server went over the menu and answered our questions in detail. He was  knowledgeable about the food, as well as the history of the place. He also made sure that our specific requests/modifications are met exactly. The food was very good and came out very quickly. The menu was straightforward and included a few fish options. We had the atlantic mackerel and the black pudding agnolotti. The mackerel was very tender and delicious, with tasty sides. The agnolotti was very good too. We went there for lunch and didn't get drinks or desserts. I am already making plans for my next visit to try out the whiskey pudding!"

/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow.That about sums it up.My cousins brought me here late one recent stormy blizzard-y night for drinks in the bar. Being a native Montrealer, I thought I was familiar with the downtown core and all its offerings. But I had never heard of this mind-blowing bar and attached restaurant, or the exquisite hotel it is housed in. (In my defense, I've been living in Seattle the past 25 years, and now Vancouver. But STILL...).Entering this establishment, you really feel like you are entering an upper-crust ""gentleman's club"" lounge from another era. Think: an exclusive bar for aristocrats out of a Sherlock Holmes novel. That's what I imagined, anyhow, with the deep wood paneling, Victorian architectural embellishments, pillars and cornices and engravings abound, coffered ceiling, commanding central bar, upholstered plush armchairs in many intimate niches, even inlaid buttons on the walls (we asked: they used to be used to ""summon"" the servers, but they've been deactivated). SO COOL. So genuinely retro. This is how drinking in a bar used to be, in a more gilded age. I was so impressed with the bar that my cousins asked the hostess in the lobby if we could check out the restaurant. She gladly escorted us inside, where I marveled at the beautiful ambiance, which was similar to the bar. Very ""old world"" and intimate. Lovely fireplace there. Just a warm and intimate dining ambiance. Looking at the menu, I'm already planning on dinner here when I next visit town. Fine dining all the way.We next visited the adjacent lobby of the hotel where we spoke to a young man behind the main counter. What a nice guy! He was so personable and very happy to be working there (his words! But it was evident in the pride he had with this beautiful hotel, and to be working in the city of Montreal. He was originally from Israel, as I recall). Just a super nice guy. The hotel label was surprisingly contemporary, being a few steps away from the old-fashioned elegance of polished wood and traditional architectural details of the bar and restaurant a few steps away. There was a huge electronic monitor on the wall, and a minimalistic front desk with sleek polished flooring. It made for an intriguing juxtaposition of aesthetics with the other areas we visited - but not unpleasant. Interesting! Looking at the photos on the monitor of the various guest rooms and suites available, I thought this would be an optimal hotel for out-of-towners. Lots of room options, and being in the heart of downtown, with such a gorgeous bar and restaurant attached, would be the ultimate."

We had a very friendly and attentive waiter who explained the menu to us. The food was very unique and delicious. I had the fish crumpet and the cauliflower salad. Together these two dishes were filling and a treat for the tastebuds. I never expected to like a cauliflower salad. In fact these two dishes were unlike anything I have had. The dessert looked incredible as well. While it is a bit pricey, I think the food is definitely unique and well put together."

The only thing I was impressed with was the decor. Everything else was a bit of a letdown - but then again, it could be because of what I ordered. The chia pudding was average at best. The British coffee was good - the booziness definitely helped to offset the otherwise unimpressing taste of the chia pudding. I coughed like crazy during the beginning of my brunch and made a mess on the table - the server did not even come to ask if I was okay. He just stood there and spoke with another server. It was only when I gave them eye contact that one of them decided to come over and help clean up the bits of cream that I coughed up. Service was, as a whole, aloof and inattentive. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back but I'll definitely try out more heartier dishes like the Full English Breakfast or chicken pot pie."

I am big fan of beet salad with goat cheese, so I was really looking forward to it. It was beautiful presentation but something was not right with the cheese. I can't point the finger what was wrong, but I can tell for sure that that salad didn't sit right with my stomach. I had to run to pharmacy to buy a Gravol right after the meal. For some reason, the goat cheese didn't even taste like it. So, I think the salad wasn't fresh."

But the she told us we couldn't order dessert because the kitchen was closed. This was upsetting as we told her way ahead we would be getting dessert. We expressed our dissatisfaction and she went back to the chef and they created something for us thankfully. The food was AMAZING !

If you love history and visiting historical places..bar George should definately be on your list. Situated on Drummond Street, this majestic home is most certainly a site for sore eyes. A handsome smiley doorman welcomes it's guests into this beautiful stone walled mansion. Stepping into the former Mount Stephen's Club is like walking back through time. Stunning hand crafted wooden walls and marble fireplaces...makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale place. What is most awesome is that they do allow guests to visit the second floor to get a glimpse of the rest of the mansion. We went for Sunday brunch and loved the whole experience. The food itself is good but it's being in the mansion that adds to the overall experience. Will definately go back to try the 5@7 at the bar area! We went on a Sunday 10am and easily found parking on the street...no parking meter fee until 1pm on Sundays. Reservations are required."

/user_details?userid=KeJf9Hn4H3sPUFbUw3Eq9A,Vivian Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Bar George was by far the prettiest bar I've ever seen. We were in Montreal for a few days and randomly stumbled upon Bar George. When we realized it was British food we decided to stay for lunch and try out the menu. I had the chicken pot pie (it was legit) and my friend ordered the Cornish hen (soooo tasty). I don't think I've ever gasped when waiters deliver my food but I did when I saw the size of my pie. Needlessly to say it was a good surprise. The service and ambiance was excellent. If you ever get the chance to visit definitely sit at the bar and try going during the day so you can see the gorgeous light that fills the room. 10/10 experience.

It's classy with tons of paintings on the walls and  the bathrooms are so fancy. The first time I came here was with my bro and my boyfriend. I found it weird that they gave us one roll of bread for three people. I asked the waiter for two extra rolls and I'm glad I did because the bread was very good. It was warm and soft and similar to a brioche. My bro had the Cornish hen. I took a bite and it was phenomenal!! Picture a beef Wellington but replace the beef with hen. It came with toasted oatmeal skirlie stuffing and traditional bread sauce. OMG!! I had the lamb sirloin with black pepper haggis, mint sauce, and potatoes. My boyfriend had the sirloin steak with Yorkshire pudding, champ,and whisky gravy. I preferred the steak to the lamb but the real winner of the night was hands down the Cornish hen. The waiter was really nice and offered us free coffee/espresso. I liked this place so much I came back with my aunt last week. My aunt and I shared the triple chips which came with a curry sauce. The fries are big and the sauce was literally just curry and not like a curry mayo. I would not recommend it. This time around I decided to get the Cornish hen. However the waitress told us that there was a Cornish hen on the special menu and it was similar to the one on the menu except that they added asparagus. So my aunt and I got the special because hey why not get asparagus for $3 extra?! But nooooo!! It was a completely different!! The one we ended up getting did not have a pastry around the hen!! It was just a roasted hen with vegetables on top of it. I was so sad. I found out later that we were misinformed and that Cornish hen I wanted was the one on the menu. Boo!! Next time I go I will definitely not make the same mistake. The hen was good but it wasn't what I wanted. If u ever go to bar George definitely get the Cornish hen. It's a must!"

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So I reconnected with a long lost cousin who was visiting Montreal and we totally hit it off! When does that happen, right? We went to dinner earlier in the week and I definitely felt like I had to repay her for the fantastic meal she paid for so I took her to Bar George for drinks. Several hours and a very hefty price tag later, we left feeling like we bonded in a magical little place. Bar George is gorgeous on the inside, regal and ornate- just like me! We sat on the large bar in the middle and made it just in time, because the place got packed around 10 pm (even on a Wednesday). The bartender was an incredibly kind and sensitive Egyptian man that was so attentive to everyone. We also ordered the fries from the delicious smells all around us (the smell was more appealing than the fries, but I don't regret my decision). I've heard the brunch at Bar George is incredible so I'll have to be back to give this a second review. Overall, if you have an out of town friend to impress, take them here and wow them with the majesty that Montreal has to offer."

/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW! Talk about a beautiful place to go eat with friends and/or family.  As soon as I walked into the Mount Stephen, I felt like I was eating somewhere in England in some sort of ""victorian style"" mansion and I was no longer in Montreal! I was immediately impressed with the amount of detailing and renovations put into this place. We were greeted right away by a hostess, who sat us in such a beautiful dining room with lovely, comfortable seating. They have a great choice of cocktails to choose from. I decided to go with a classic, Pimms cup. It was delicious! The menu consists of choices of fish, steak, chicken and pork. The servings are of decent size and the food is delicious.  As we were served our plates, the waiter explained every detail about how the dish was prepared. I ordered the cornish hen. The food was delicious and I don't really have any complaints! I would definitely come back here for a birthday dinner, a 5 a 7 with friends, or before going out. The building is so lovely and all of the detailing really pays off. I do hope that their menu does change from time to time, as the menu can be a bit repetitive if I do want to keep coming back more often."

We even made time for a rich chocolate tart with ginger sorbet. Everything was spectacular and the building itself is worth a visit. I wish I would have taken photos but I couldn't stop myself from eating enough to remember."

I called to ask if he could serve  on my family and I because I really wanted to make an impression and he totally went beyond my expectations.  The food is absolutely fantastic,  as good as any 5 star restaurant in Montreal, which is saying something.  I loved the boudin noir canneloni/scallop/ cauliflower dish.  It was so imaginative and the flavors went together so well."
/user_details?userid=AxGGEda-D5aa26KQmoYMrA,Erika A.,"Plymouth, MA",5 star rating,Beautiful place for brunch with an exceptional staff ! They made sure everything was perfect !! I feel like I stepped back in time! The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting yet elegant and romantic. The avocado toast was perfect and the full English breakfast was huge! Mimosas and cappuccino are a must try! We sat at the bar and the seats are so comfy ! The warm jazzy frank Sinatra music in the background while sipping cappuccino made me feel like royalty in this beautiful setting! Don't skip this place!!!

/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Exquisite decor and top notch service. The menu, though not very extensive, offers some classic British dishes. We had the burger, scotch egg and chicken pot pie and they were all perfectly executed."
/user_details?userid=CqwWKYBfrR35jHiFBjBD-Q,Labonneviveuse S.,"Edmonton, Canada",2 star rating,"The bar is a beautiful place to sit. I was very disappointed, however, with the pain perdu. It was small, cold, and the berries weren't ""muddled."" Deeply unsatisfying. When the waitress asked me how my food was, I told her. I got no response. I had to ask for the menu so I might order something else. This time I tried the buttermilk scone. The scone itself was delicious. But it came with little glass jars of poor quality jam and no clotted cream. Given that the place prides itself on being ""British"" the latter should be regarded as essential, and a lavish joint like this should definitely be serving up fresh jam!"

/user_details?userid=D--50tew2XcHQ7-GJDjdXQ,Dee A.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"We came to this bar for three of our four nights in Montréal. What a fantastic bar. Stunning decor and atmosphere, beautiful building, friendly, unpretentious staff. Prices not as sky-high as you would expect from a bar in the lobby of a five star hotel. Easily and quickly became one of our favorite bars in any city. The music was different every weeknight we visited (ranging from 80s to jazz) and was a little more upbeat when we visited on a Saturday. (Also much more crowded!) My suggestion, wrap up a day of shopping at around 4 with a seat at or around the bar."
/user_details?userid=9-TV_gHUZheMNKkMR4hQyA,Sam O.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,"With no doubt the classiest bar in Montreal , the charm of the old place , the marvelous wood and marble work give this place a class by it's own . Everything about the bar is fantastic except the slow service ,the restaurant is little disappointing , the quantities are too small , the waiters are friendly but not well trend . I guess things will get better with time"
/user_details?userid=mNU-5CY-Rm0sjYhNloU3Gw,Skmtl M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,The venue is beautiful and rich. Very cozy atmosphere. The bar area is far too loud for a conversation. The music can be turned down a bit and still have a party/festive atmosphere. We were 8 for a birthday dinner in the main dining room which is really lovely. The cocktails were quite good (Golden Square Mile Sour & Lady Stephen) while pricey. The mushroom soup was beautifully flavoured but should have been thinned out as it was almost like a thick puree. The fish dishes were good but we found the accompaniments way too salty whether you had the organic salmon or Icelandic cod.  Overall the dishes weren't memorable for the prices charged. The chocolate and ginger tart was delicious and the warm whisky pudding with ice-cream is very sweet and rich. A few bites is all you need! I would come back here for brunch or afternoon tea or even drinks as it's such a nice environment. Valet parking is available for $15 or if you go after 6pm on a Tues/Wed you can park around the corner on De Maisonneuve at an outdoor lot of $6.
