We were very happy with food and A-Mazing service. 5 reasons I want you to visit and I'll be back. 1. Decor is very unique. It's Moroccan North African. 2. We ordered soup which was delicious and filling. Ask for ""Harissa"" if you wanna add spice to it. 3. Olives and bread were good too. 4. We were so full but I wanted to try merguez (North African sausage my favorite) They were so nice they just brought some as tapas instead of us asking to place the full order. 5. Tea was amazing. Full halal establishment. Enjoy your meal there."

We had already sampled another restaurant the year before, so this year, it was Mogador's turn. We wanted to put luck on our side and arrived 10 minutes after the opening over the week-end. The place was predictably empty and we lounged about, right behind the lovely window. The decor is quite beautiful, and if the wait gets long, you can always grab books!The regular couscous is just that, the royal couscous is where it's at though! I don't remember now what were the extras, but man it was rich, filling, and piping hot! I had the apricot tajine, and while it was delicious - equally piping hot- you should know it contains what is on the menu in the strictest sense: apricots, lamb, almonds. That's all folks! No veggies anywhere. The ice cream served in a lemon is inspired, but came straight from the freezer, so we looked at it for a long time.What really bothered us was that the waiter/cook/owner came around mid-meal to ask us to change tables - in an empty restaurant. He apologized and explained that the large table was reserved for a birthday, but uh, we were celebrating too.. The people never did show up. I guess it's on us for not having reservations, but we didn't want to party either. Either way, maybe going there for lunch, right as it opens it's a good idea :/"

By the time we found this restaurant, they were closing but still chose to let us in, which was great. There was a group of people just dancing with loud moroccan music in the middle of the restaurant which I loved seeing! They added a special touch to the whole moroccan experience. We were seated at these low, adorable, golden tables (that were actually kinda small for the six of us, but we managed to eat at the same table) and on absolutely confortable seats. The low lighting made it more intimate for us and was perfect for the occasion and the decorations just made us feel like we were elsewhere completely. Also, the staff was so sweet even though we came in so late. When the food came, it was really hot, but my tajine was absolutely delicious, although I wasn't completely full. Unfortunately, there were some other meals that weren't that good, and were just plain and okay. We still really had fun in this restaurant, and I'd still go back and carefully choose my meals just to enjoy the festive atmosphere!"

People were dancing and welcoming us the moment we stepped in that restaurant. Our orders came faster than I expected and for a person who has never eaten Moroccan food,  I was really eager to try my couscous. At first, it was good. The taste was very different from the couscous I normally eat, but because it was very dry I wasn't enjoying it as much as I thought I was. However, that won't stop me from trying another Moroccan meal!"

From the moment you open the door you are in another world, the smell, the lights, the tables, the decor it's amazing.Love their couscous, the tajines, the pastillas, the Mogador Tea and the orange blossom pudding. The portions are a little small it's the only downer. I'm a fan"
