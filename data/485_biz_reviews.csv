/user_details?userid=lOUsfGYvP7aThtpIQbqyVw,Jacky Eats Mtl ..,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"No Clowning around.Il Pagliaccio is a cozy fine dining restaurant with chic/modern decor. Jacky juggled his 5 course meal of beet salad, eggplant parm, gnocchi & a tender cut of contre fillet de veau accompanied with an array of premium wines. Head pagliaccio, Manny, is serving fresh of the day. No frozen foods on your dish unless you get the semi-fredo for dessert. Price is no laughing matter but expected for the great/classy service & quality of food. Parking is a joke but you'll have the last laugh once you're done with this joint.Follow @JackyEatsMTL"

This is small cozy Italian restaurant with staff that is attentive.The menu is limited but yet covers all areas of meat, pasta and fish for your delight. Crusty Bread and bread sticks are served immediately before ordering. Sweet potato and carrot soup for appetizer. Light and tasty. My main course was filet of veal with a green peppercorn sauce served with an array of veggies. Cooked to perfection. To end the lunch I had my signature cappuccino with panne cotta (mediocre). My experience as a whole was wonderful, good food with a romantic twist."

Was reluctant initially but am glad I came. Food was wonderful. The highlight: a homemade tagliatelle w white truffle and egg yolk (this was a special). Fabulous!!! Also had their fish of the day which was well executed and simple. Not too heavy and sauced up. Finished the meal off w a panna cotta. Probably the low point of the meal: just ok, nothing special.Overall: may skip dessert in the future but will most definitely be back.(Remark: I give 4 stars for now since the dessert wasn't perfect and I wonder if the incredible white truffle starter is an outlier that isn't always available. If my latter worry is assuaged in a future visit, I'll probably revise to 5 stars.)"
/user_details?userid=o-HL7frA9e6FajGevKJsOQ,Susan W.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Absolutely delicious Italian food with a warm and welcoming staff who even brought a kid-friendly amuse bouche for the littlest diners at our table. House made breadsticks and bread keep the kids happy while you enjoy the more sophisticated fare.

/user_details?userid=DQD_436KsMmIIprc5XASKQ,David C.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,We ordered 2 pasta dishes. My partner saw nothing she wanted so they created a special dish for her. Both dishes were excellent and the service was warm and friendly.
