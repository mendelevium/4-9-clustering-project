/user_details?userid=0cHEkFahUqJiobK3vo8BbA,Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",5 star rating,"Café Bistro Mon Plaisir is a lovely little spot located just two blocks from the Cathedrale de Notre-Dame in Vieux-Quebec. The café itself is quite nice, comfortable and inviting, with many small tables where you can sit back and enjoy a little something to start your day. What brought me her this particular morning was a photo posted by a fellow Yelper of a lox and bagel sandwich, and my quest was well-worth the walk from my hotel. Start with a classic toasted and seeded Montréal-style bagel, add a generous portion of quality smoked salmon on some greens, top the salmon with a sprig of dill and some cucumber, and put that all on a bed of creamy cream cheese. Partner that with a strong cup of coffee and you've got yourself a winner. The owner and his staff are quite nice, and the café also offers a variety of choices for lunch for stay-in or take-away. You might easily walk past Café Bistro Mon Plaisir because of the Nestlé and Haagen-Dazs ice cream posters in the window, thinking that it's a tourist trap, but it's not - inside, some tasty pleasures await your arrival."

I experienced quality customer service paired with delicious food. As an English speaker, the staff accommodated me and helped me maneuver the French menu with suggestions. We had a croissant with jam, egg sandwich croissant, and two coffees. All excellent with welcoming and cozy atmosphere."

We ordered the croissant sandwiches and they did not disappoint. The croissants were so fresh and the sandwich was delicious. We came back on Saturday to have breakfast again but they were closed
/user_details?userid=iloYf0yq9TQhuJI0mHZxKw,Bobby C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,Great little french cafe in old Montreal.  Killer breakfast bagel and coffee for $5!   Take a stroll down the old streets of Montreal inhale the smoke and construction diesel lurching around each corner.  French colonial history embedded in the cobblestone roads.
/user_details?userid=A5qdTzr16HEMEQ_URi3_BA,Michael P.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"Montreal for the weekend. First breakfast was quite fancy, see my other reviews to see where I went. At that other place we waited in line for 30 minutes for a good breakfast. Decided to change up the pace for breakfast when coming to cafe Bistro Mon Plaisir. No one was here this morning with the exception to one man reading the newspaper. The hostess greeted us in French and English, as usual, and then conversed with us in English. I've never had any language barriers in Montreal, this was no different. We ordered the bagel sandwich and a quiche. Bagel came with cream cheese, lox, and cucumber. Initially, I thought that I would get a cold bagel as she took an already made sandwich. But with some black magic trickery she was able to toast the bagel and still keep everything else fresh. The bagel wasn't drop your clothes, best thing I ever ate, but it was a very good quality bagel sandwich. As a tourist I wouldn't come here again because there are so many options for me, but if I lived in Montreal it wouldn't definitely be a place I make a regular for a quick breakfast if I worked/lived nearby. We also ordered a quiche which was quite pleasant and came out warm and delicious. The size of the piece was very generous and I was definitely full by the end of breakfast.If you're looking for a quick breakfast place that is no thrills, but delivers on tasty food, this is a place to consider."

/user_details?userid=l04QmkEARudoSgHCXcJtuA,Jeremiah C.,"White Plains, NY",4 star rating,Great coffee shop around the corner from Notre Dame! Recommend this to anyone who needs a good pick me up at an affordable rate! Their macchiato is strong and gave me the boost I needed to conquer the blazing sun.
/user_details?userid=O3M72g7L7amnH-uJhAsIjQ,Sammie L.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",5 star rating,My mother and I got the salmon with lox and it was delicious. Their sweets and cappuccinos are good as well. Very cute atmosphere would definitely come back again!
/user_details?userid=f2iqOc1r-rh4xtfg9MKbQw,Liudmila D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A nice place for a quick bite.  I was lured in by a sign of my favorite coffee on the wall - Illy (which is apparently not used to make a regular coffee). The Mon Plaisir croissant with ham, cheese and lettuce was tasty. The personnel was courteous. I didn't see any sign of a washroom, but my hotel was around the corner, so I didn't specifically ask where it was."
/user_details?userid=-atxx_G9W1sXZ1RYDqUSVg,Dave L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Small cafe with some seating.  They have food but it's not cooked there so if you have something like an omelet it will be precooked and warmed in the microwave, same with the soup.  Friendly service.  Nice for what it is but probably best for coffee.  If you want a full breakfast go elsewhere."

/user_details?userid=kbE5U8Xhag-VP6_hIpZ9zQ,Luke W.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Great place to sit and use the computer - not crowded, great wifi and some socketsThe food is excellent by cafe standards, I've tried two chicken salads and the quiche. The service is friendly. Menu is all in French which may be why there's not more tourist traffic, but the staff speak English."
/user_details?userid=F4uUNDIUWMUuH1ZJU6gmEw,Wendy B.,"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",5 star rating,"Decided to eat here based on Yelp reviews. Cafe Bistro Mon Plaisir did not disappoint. We had salmon bagels that had just the right amount of dill, cream cheese and cucumbers. The cappuccinos were also delicious. Highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=j2YPR5SYgpgMnlj3hZbpLg,Library G.,"Greenville, RI",4 star rating,"The croissant with egg and cheese was excellent, my husband said his bagel with salmon and stuff was also very good. They gave me coffee instead of the tea I ordered, but the coffee was also quite good. Comfortable and relaxed place for a quick breakfast before exploring Montreal."
/user_details?userid=9WtNJYQlnluVVGq0PYy0pQ,Andrew R.,"Calabasas, CA",5 star rating,"Visiting from Los Angeles. We stayed in Quebec City and Montreal for a little over a week, and actively searched for the best croissant. Crazy,  I know. But, hey... why not. We stopped here for a quick bite, not thinking it was going to be great. Wow, I was wrong. The BEST croissant I've ever had. Period. Chocolate and hazelnut heaven. Their quiche is very,  very good,  as well.  Coffee is Illy, I believe. Can't go wrong there. Service excellent. Highly recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=IcMBRRt0gMbDhi4I_hvgLA,Amanda K.,"Charleston, SC",4 star rating,Sandwiches are pretty good. I had no idea how it would taste and it was an excellent pick to have for lunch! Being that I only speak English it was sort of difficult to communicate with the employees. But they were nice to me. The drink selection is great btw.

Bottom line: Come here, you won't regret it!"

Their breakfast is fresh made and ample. Excellent coffee too! There are awesome sandwiches and other tasty pastries to take along as you tour the old city. I'd highly recommend this place!.

/user_details?userid=mWqgE5aqCWCkG_gNvGmzNQ,Ivy D.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here for a quick snack while touring Old Montreal. It was a cute little store and perfect for a quick rest and free WiFi. I enjoyed the decor and I really loved the chairs they were cute and comfortable. It was not crowded and the other people I saw there either had take out or were also unwinding in the shop with their laptops. The staff were friendly and hospitable, spoke in English. Ordered a green salad (which they didn't have already made so they offered to make me a fresh one) and a chai latte, both of which I enjoyed. Was worried they didn't have a washroom bur after searching, they definitely do have a single washroom next to the counter, on the other side of the main seating area."
/user_details?userid=MCdgzhntTVK0OEH0ivqpEw,Stuart ..,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,Very friendly staff.  Excellent espresso and the croissants are excellent.  Highly recommended.
/user_details?userid=YpTtBJuRdQuAXxtoTOLnPA,Paul A.,"Burlington, Canada",4 star rating,Enjoyed a double shot macchiato whilst sitting in the winter sun that was streaming in the window. Nice slice of chocolate cake. Wish these places would open earlier in the day but notice that later opening hours seem to be more common in Montreal. That is you can't just pop in for a coffee first thing morning.
/user_details?userid=8P7N4FzCrLrFeBn9MmmZVQ,Becca H.,"Torrance, CA",4 star rating,"Yummy shrimp sandwich on a bagel bun!  This was a nice spot to sit and grab lunch while walking around Old Port.  It's cute and quaint with great lunch specials.  I was delighted to see that they had a shrimp sandwich and immediately settled on that for lunch.  The shrimps were plentiful and didn't have a fishy smell.  The bagel bun was amazing.  It was the everything bagel but light, crispy, and chewy.  I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Old Port!"
