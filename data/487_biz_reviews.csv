The service is top notch, they have Wifi, the patio is gorgeous, and the food is excellent!  Dine here if you're hungry!!They offer omelettes, waffles, salmon, roast or prime rib, salads, vegetables, fruit, desserts, mimosas, etc.I stumbled upon this gem and am so glad I did.  I got to eat before hiking Mount Royal and it was exactly the kind of food I needed.  I could've spent more time here it was that enjoyable!"

For the quality and quantity of food served, the cost is reasonable!For $36, you get a choice of appetizer, main, dessert and coffee/tea. The lunch options were extensive and there's something for everyone - carnivores, pescatarians and vegetarians.I ordered the Beef Tartare for my appetizer. The portion was insanely huge and could have quite easily been a main. It's served with a hand full of match stick fries and crispy capers. The tartare was well seasoned and enjoyable. For my main, I ordered the grilled lamb chops, salsa verde, pearl couscous and eggplant caviar. The entire plate was delicious, and once again, the portion was more than enough. For dessert, I had the cheese cake. This may have been the highlight of the meal for me. I found the texture wasn't as dense as your typical cheesecake - it was light and fluffy.Luckily for me, this restaurant is a stone's throwaway from work. So, yes - I will definitely be returning very soon!"

We had the choice to sit inside or outside on the terrace. Beautiful summer night is to be enjoyed outdoors. There are 2 different menu's and I opted for the dinner menu. Ambiance was upbeat since they have a DJ playing some good music. The hostess was friendly and shared some info on the menu's.  I started with a Virgin Caesar which was refreshing and ordered the Ricotta and Tomme d'elle cheese gnocchi with peas as the main course. Small portion, light with some nice flavours. Night cap was a Cappuccino. The whole picture was enjoyable. My friend Fatina ordered from the Bar menu which the portions are bigger. She took home a doggy bag. Lol. Oysters seem to be the hit on the menu. Left with"

It was close to where we were staying, so it was perfect. We ordered the seared scallops for an appetizer and the duck as an entree. Service was amazing the second we got there. They seated us at a nice spot away from the big tables so it was nice and romantic. Ambience was really nice. They began the course with a basket of bread and an amuse bouche which I was not expecting. I forgot what it was but it was certainly delicious. The scallops came out first and it was cooked perfectly. It was so sweet and paired very well with the peas, corn, and purée. Not to mention, the presentation was amazing. I'd have to say that this is my favorite way of eating scallops. Yum! When the duck came out, I was pleasantly surprised to see what a big portion it was. At this point I was so glad I shared with my friend since we both don't have big appetites to begin with. The duck was cooked perfectly. It was paired with mushrooms, rhubarb, cherries, chives, and two other sauces that I don't remember (but very delicious). The mix of all the flavors were amazing and would love to eat duck prepared like this all the time now. Although we only ordered two things, it was enough to make us fall in love with French food all over again! We were so glad to have experienced it here at Renoir and I cannot wait to recommend this to everybody I know."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4.5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Price: $$$$We made reservations through Opentable and arrived promptly on time. After checking with the host, we were brought to our table as they asked us about coat check. They also brought over a bag hanger for my handbag which I thought was very thoughtful!There was only one menu available to order at Renoir for Christmas - their Christmas Dinner Special! At its affordable price, we were able to taste foie gras, truffle, and caviar all in one evening! Because I was in my third month of pregnancy, I was very careful with what I was eating. Hubby and I chose to order one of each choices available, with my husband having the foods that I couldn't have :P, such as caviar and foie gras. We also skipped on wine pairing...because well I was pregnant and hubby was being considerate :D.Not too long after we ordered, complimentary bread was brought out. Nothing too special here.Our first dish of the night started out with foie gras panfried and paired with pork shoulder. I didn't have too much of the foie gras (just a bite) but it was so delicious! Paired with butternut squash and sweet and sour mushrooms, the appetizer was very enjoyable. Very satisfied!The next dish, or the first main course consisted of homemade buckwheat flour gnocchi, artichoke cream and fresh sea urchins. Of course, I couldn't have sea urchin...so my husband had it. Now that I think about it, we should've asked beforehand what Renoir's Christmas dinner menu consisted of, or at least if dietary substitutions were available. Too bad we realized this late! Anyway, this wasn't my favourite dish, but it was still quite enjoyable. Perhaps I didn't like it as much because I couldn't fully enjoy all the ingredients in the main course.The next course was a refresher in between our main courses, the gingerbread granité. I had a feeling that it may have been made with alcohol, so I asked our server if it was as I was pregnant. He promptly returned with a alcohol-free version for me to enjoy :). Essentially, granité is a granita, a cold shaved refresher made with sugar, water and other flavourings. The gingerbread was a great flavour especially for the Christmas season, and as it's one of my favourite desserts, having it in an ice cold version like this was a pleasurable experience. Kudos to Renoir for also having alcohol-free versions available!My husband decided to get the first choice on the menu for his second main course: Royal quail, foie gras, black truffle and vegetables. I, on the other hand, decided to try their second choice: Arctic char, cauliflower mousse line, Granny Smith apples, shellfish and caviar.Hubby and I were both quite surprised that we were able to see foie gras, black truffle and caviar in both of our dishes put together. At the price of the Christmas menu, it doesn't seem like it's possible as the three ingredients are fairly expensive. Well, we weren't complaining! My husband enjoyed his dish very much, while I was pretty content with mine as well. I gave the caviar portion to hubby for him to eat instead of me :(.Overall, both dishes were equally delicious but I think the royal quail was more preferred by both of us over the Arctic char.For dessert, we had the chocolate orange yule log with orange sabayon and praline chocolate. I didn't think I'd like it very much but to my surprise, I finished the entire slice wanting seconds! Google tells me sabayon is like a light custard like dessert with origins in Italy. I'm not the biggest fan of having citrus flavours with chocolate (I like my chocolate dense and rich), but this dessert was quite good even with the orange flavours.VerdictOverall, Renoir's Christmas dinner is phenomenal for the price you need to pay. At $89 per person, having 4 full courses is a real bang for your buck deal! The ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant is also the perfect place to enjoy a romantic dinner date with your significant other, with friends, family, and much more. The upscale hotel atmosphere also makes it suitable for formal meetings.The service we received was fantastic - everyone was all very friendly and helpful with all of our requests no matter how small or large. I do wish the menu had more dietary options, but we never asked if substitutions were available beforehand.Now that I'm not pregnant anymore (yes I gave birth! :D), I would love to go back for a full on meal with my husband and enjoy all the foie gras I can have; too bad I now live in Vancouver! Anyway, I highly recommend Renoir and their Christmas Dinner this upcoming winter season (I know it's so far away...but you can never be too early!) and I'd love to hear your thoughts about it if you decide to go!As Renoir is located inside Sofitel Hotel, valet parking is available."
/user_details?userid=0jei54nHjA5QT-VHiw04Gw,Alan M.,"Medway, MA",5 star rating,"My wife and I went here for Christmas Dinner.  Renoir was one of the only places that was open in the area of Montreal that we were in, and we wanted to ""take it up a notch"" for the holiday and eat in a fine restaurant.  Arriving at the Sofitel hotel, we were directed to the restaurant by the doorman and they have a coat rack outside the restaurant or you can check your coat.  We went for the early seating at 7:00 and after they checked us in, we were taken to our table by the windows.  The menu was set already and the only thing we had to decide was whether or not to get the wine flight with each course, which we did.  Though this was a very high end restaurant, sometimes they strike out and that happened to me, in that the appetizer, I just didn't like...it was made properly but the flavor just didn't appeal to me.  The server AND the manager came over and offered to replace the dish, but when I told them I didn't like it, he said and I quote, ""We want you to enjoy all of your dinner, and if you don't mind waiting for a bit, we will make you something that you'll enjoy.""  Needless to say, they did not disappoint.The servers were bi-lingual, which was helpful as I don't speak French, though one of the servers did not know that we only spoke English and came over with our entrees, and started to describe them in French...and while I didn't understand what she was saying, it sounded wonderful.  When she switched up to English after being tipped off about our language preference, her English was good, but one could tell that French was her language of choice.  The service was impeccable, the food was good, though the portions were small (typical of fine dining places), and all in all, my wife and I got to hobnob with what felt like high society for a little while.  All in all, I would recommend Renoir to anyone who enjoys fine dining."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We went for Sunday brunch, the price tag was 170 for 2 adults and one 5 year old child, no extras. We also brought a baby but it was free for her. My complaints are not price related given that I knew it beforehand. At that price however, I expect a minimum of service. We were told upon arrival that the place was fully booked. Not true. We were there 90 minutes and more than half the tables were empty.Basically, my issue is that we were completely ignored.We must have asked for water at least five times, only to get it at the same time as the bill (when I had already left). We also tried to get a bottle of bubbly water, but no one would stop for us to ask even when we signalled them! What was even more frustrating was the lack of place on the table. They did not pick up the plates in between servings. After I told a server that we had no more place on the table... she just said ok... but didn't take them. She wasn't rude or anything just completely clueless. I also had the baby's plate in front of me to avoid her throwing things around. When she wanted more fruit I had to get a plate and actually pile it up on top of the other two. The pile was still there when I left. (This place is in the Sofitel?!?!?)My son asked for juice and I promise you I really tried to get it but it was impossible. One person told me they would tell my waiter, but the juice wasn't coming. I got up to look for my waiter but could not find him. Finally asked a waitress where he was, she said she didn't know but nicely said that she could help me. So I asked her for the juice. And still never got it! I got so frustrated at being ignored with a table of dirty plates, I left my husband to it and waited outside. My son still wanted a juice so we stopped at a cafe on Sherbrooke.The food itself was very good... Not a huge selection but excellent quality.  I haven't tried the desserts because I was so upset I just wanted to get out of there. I just don't understand how a place like this can just completely ignore people. Everyone was polite and our waiter even apologized to my husband by saying he had no time?!? What a waste of money just to be left feeling so angry."

Prices were high, making the Mtl a Table menu very worth it. The gnocchi appetizer was made with a very flavourful cheese. The cod was cooked perfectly. The dessert was tasty, but the layers were quite thick and it was a bit hard to eat through them all at once.What I enjoyed most was the excellent service. Upscale but very friendly. Given the price, I might need to wait until my parents are back in town to come again!"

/user_details?userid=rrNx9GQGp30RaHhBH3XrJw,Alex P.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"We stayed at the hotel (Sofitel) where the restaurant is located and dined at Renoir twice (also had breakfast twice). The restaurant has a formal dining area as well as a more casual bar area. First night we tried their formal dining. The service was excellent. The dishes were good (to be honest, we really liked the appetizers; the main courses were good) and the presentation was excellent.Second night we tried the bar seating. It was cozy and comfortable. The dishes we tried (a hamburger and a roasted beef sandwich) were perhaps slightly underwhelming even for a bar menu. But the staff were very polite and welcoming.A bit of a mixed impression from our breakfast experience. First day, the staff were very attentive and our breakfast was out on time. Second day was pretty much the opposite. Perhaps something was wrong or we were just unlucky at that time."
/user_details?userid=RkVNb4DpKwehS3FAziAMVA,Kelly K.,"Reston, VA",2 star rating,"This restaurant was recommended in the AAA book.   Had a good first impression on dining room and outdoor patio.  Opted for the outdoor patio because of the nice weather.  Seats outside are not very comfortable as they were plastic. I waited 15 minutes for a waitress to take my order.  My first choice from the menu  not available.  My second wasn't either!  Off to a bad start.   They should tell you up front what isn't on avaiable when they give you the menu or better yet print a daily menu.  Prixe fix dinner here set me back 66.69 before tip.  I opted to start with a first course of black rice with a zucchini flower fried on top and burratta cheese.  The complimentary basket of bread offered a variety of tasty breads.  The waitress brought out a complimentary mini appetizer that was excellent-two morels with tiny slices of zucchini over a mini toast.   After 30 minutes of sitting I got my first course.  It did not look appealing nor taste good.  The black rice was cooked right but was way too salty.  The burratta cheese just tasted like the cracked black peppercorns that was liberally added to the cheese.  The only tasty thing was the one fried zucchini flower, which was excellent.  The waitress asked how I like the dish and I told her that I didn't like it.  There was no offer to switch it out nor was my empty water glass filled until I finally asked for more water. I told the waitress that I hoped the main course would not be too salty or peppery.  Had I not been tired I would have insisted they take back this dish and provide something else.An hour into dinner, finally got the main course of lamb and was told by a different waitress that it had no pepper or salt.  It didn't have pepper but my palate sensed it had salt and alittle too much of it.  Meanwhile, I overheard the couple at the next table complain that one of their first courses was too salty!  The lamb was not the best cut of meat but was okay.  It was served with green beans, yellow beans, yummy baby carrots, baby parsnips and a few fresh herbs.   Too much salt on vegetables when they did not need any salt.  I thik it was missing a key ingredient that was on the menu, lardons.  Another waitress offered to make up for the quality of food with a free salad though I declined.  Ended the meal with a berry creme eclair and a very good cappuccino.  The service was slow and so it almost two hours to eat from sitting down to dessert.  Way too long sitting in hard plastic chairs!  I wish my order had been as good as the free appetizer of morels and zucchini.  A good start to meal went downhill from there.  Considering the cost of 67 before tip, I expected better service, better food, and better chairs.  The manager came over too acknowledge that my complaint will be addressed with the kitchen.  I won't be coming back to find out if things improve."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is decent and the service is good. I think it's generally overpriced - especially for Montreal. On my most recent breakfast there, I had the bagel and lox (nothing special compared to other places), a coffee, and an orange juice (fresh). Total was over $40. I believe a comparable meal can be had for $20-25 elsewhere - with comparable service. So you pay a fairly large premium for something they looks slightly upscale. I don't value this too much - but that's a personal preference thing."

/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"IAteMontreal received a great honour recently, the honour of dining at Restaurant Renoir at the Sofitel Montreal. It would be so easy to say the meal was a work of art, but it was beyond that it was a true masterpiece.""One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.""― Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's OwnTo say we dined well at the Renoir would be an understatement, because it was just not about the food, it was the ambiance, and it was about the people. Usually around this point we regale you with the fashion and the decor of the restaurant, but there is not much to say. It was after all a Sofitel establishment and the mane Sofitel speaks for itself. But if we had to choose our word for the Sofitel Montreal it would be perfection and the Renoir was just that perfection.""Pull up a chair. Take a taste. Come join us. Life is so endlessly delicious.""― Ruth ReichlOur favorite part of the Renoir, only because we had to choose one, was the people who work there. We use the term ""work"" very loosely here, because quite frankly the staff just love what they do. How do we know this? We know because they exude such joy in being around their customers. Under the tutelage of Chef Perret the kitchen works like a well-oiled creative machine, delivering divine dish after dish. The attentive wait staff is always there with a recommendation, or to take care of your requests. With a management team like Karim Ikrimeh and Marc Pichot we learned very quickly why the team worked so well together.""There is no love sincerer than the love of food.""― George Bernard Shaw, Man and SupermanBut enough about the staff, on to the center of attention of the night, the meal. With enough food to share with our new friends we were invited to sample the best the Renoir had to offer. It was simply amazing.We began our experience with the charcuterie board, overflowing with, proscuito, garlic sausage, a very spicy chorizo, raisin and mushroom sausage, fois gras, and smoked duck breast. It did not matter what we tried first we had to try it all. There was also the perfect accompaniment of a selection of cheeses, Monsieur Emile, Cabanon, Charlevoix 1608, and finally Bleu Ermite. The complimenting cheeses made the charcuterie board the only way to start your dinner or a nice sampling to enjoy with a glass of wine or two during a 5 a 7.""The only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook.""― Julia ChildAs we were experiencing the bar menu, the next dish was of course the delicious burger, The (Ham)Bourgeois of Yul. The burger is served the traditional Montreal way with fries and coleslaw. It was presented to us along side it's counterpart of the Dish of the Moment, the codfish tempura sandwich. The codfish tempura was a stroke of genius and a must try for all seafood lovers. Since we tried the burgers we had to try the hot dog, if you could call it a hot dog. Filipe's Sausage was no ordinary dog, with the pickled veggies and the truffled mustard it was the king of hot dogs and Filipe should be very proud. Should you feel the need to share these ample sized sandwiches, the staff would be happy to divide them for you.As we are in Montreal, you cannot enjoy bar food without having the top Montreal dish, poutine. The Poutine Qwack is, as you can tell by the name, covered with duck confit and a red wine sauce. You may also choose to add a sublime helping of fois gras, making it the perfect poutine. Be sure to watch for the Renoir's offering during poutine week coming in February 2016.  Because what else do we have to do in February but eat the best poutine in the city. If that was not enough to eat we were offered a special treat, the KCG ribs. Braised ribs prepared in a sweet and sour sauce, the were so good the meat melted on your tongue.""We must have a pie. Stress cannot exist in the presence of a pie.""― David Mamet, Boston MarriageSadly we had to come to the conclusion of our dining experience. But not before being served an angelic selection of the most delectable desserts. Alas no pie, but we were presented with eclairs, cakes, fruits and more. Our choices, well that we are keeping to ourselves, you will just have to go and try them all.""Seize the moment. Remember all those women on the 'Titanic' who waved off the dessert cart.""― Erma BombeckThanks to the amazing staff and management at the Restaurant Renoir, it was an experience we shall never forget."

Tender, fresh, and the fat was crispy and just perfect!

There was a bit of different flavors in each dish ranging from sweet to salty.Service: 1/5, this is where the restaurant loses its stars with me. We had 3 people in our party sharing 2 main dishes. Every time a dish came out we had to ask for an extra plate as if I would be eating off the table. Second, when the bill came, our waitress (Justine) charged us for a 3 course meal and an entree which is more expensive than just the appetizer and 2 main dishes that we ordered. When we tried to tell her so that she can fix the bill, she huffed and puffed and walked away and told us she would be back later. Third, in a nice restaurant like this, you would expect that water would be refilled without asking. We had to ask every time we needed water to be refilled and the glasses were smaller than average. We ended up giving her a 15% tip from my usual 20% and that is being very generous.Atmosphere: 4/5, dim, romantic type ambiance.

I ordered the lamb for dinner  and smoked duck / melon appetizer... WOW! The food was amazing !!! If I were home I would have definitely eaten the meat from the bone lol. The staff was absolutely exemplary of what a high end restaurant should strive for.  They were engaging, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.  Unfortunately this is our last night in Canada but we definitely ended it well at Renoir!  The drinks were PERFECT!  You definitely get what you pay for here... I ordered chicken strips for my kids and one didn't eat them because he said they had no taste.  The other ate just half of the portion (which was generous). Just to preface, my kids have eaten chicken strips from mom and pop places to high end steak houses / restaurants so they kind of know their chicken strips lol.  For that, I may take a half star off, but honestly this is not a place for young kids anyway so that's why I'm keeping it 5 stars for the adults. My picky husband had a burger and he said it was really good which for him, is saying a lot. The atmosphere : it was a very relaxed atmosphere with varied age groups, dress code was cocktail casual but we were casual as we just hopped down from our room in the Sofitel.  We sat in really comfy lounge chairs by the bar.  The restaurant itself wasn't very crowded, but the area by the bar remained packed.  You can order from the bar menu or the restaurant menu in that area so it was perfect... when we come back to Montreal I would definitely visit again."

We were greeted by a friendly waitress and she informed us that they had a bar menu available. We didn't feel like having a full scale dinner, so we opted to sit in the bar.I read over their bar menu and wasn't too enthused about the options they had; therefore, I asked for their restaurant menu (which was allowed). She was hesitant to give us the main menu, as she stated it was more sophisticated than the bar menu. I don't think she implied it to sound rude, as she was trying to help us, but it could have been interpreted that way since the BF and I were in casual gear. However, she provided stellar service, so the problem wasn't there.Some other positives were the free olives, nuts, and pretzels to snack on. Also, we received a free amuse bouche. The last positive was the ambiance, as it was casual and made us feel relaxed.However, the food is less than to be desired. Everything was overcooked! I decided to order from the ""sophisticated menu"", and was sorely disappointed. First, the amuse bouche, it tasted like bad sushi. It's free, so it didn't really matter much. It was a fried tempura muscle with some spicy mayo sauce. It would have been okay if there was something acid to counteract with the salty notes, like a lemon squirt. Also, the oyster tasted super fishy. Not sure if it was the muscle or the batter, but it was not pleasant. Then we got our appetizer. It was razor clams, raspberries, and baby leeks. The leeks weren't cooked enough, they were tough. I only ate a little bit of the leeks. The razor calms were delicious but would have been better if they cut the raspberries into smaller bites to match the razor clams. The raspberries added a nice sweet and tart note to the dish. I ordered the swordfish with stuffed squid over black rice. The rice was delicious but everything else was overcooked. The stuff squid was so tough that it took forever for me to cut into it and to chew it. The swordfish was dry because it wasn't cook properly. It had great seasoning, but wished it was more moist. Finally, the stuffed zucchini flower was such a letdown. I loved stuffed zucchini flowers, but the batter or something had a super fishy taste. It tasted exactly like the amuse bouche batter. The fish taste was not expected and was more towards the rancid end of sea flavor. I didn't finish it but my boyfriend, the human garbage disposal did. The whole dish had no balance, just like the amuse bouche - it was seafood salty. I had a strawberry cake-like dessert. It was tasty but nothing memorable. Overall, it was a huge let down for me. The service and ambiance was great, especially in the bar area. However, the food had a lot of flaws."
/user_details?userid=m9N0pWvqTiOhWnFiv_FLLQ,Remco T.,"Newton, MA",3 star rating,The food was just alright. We visited during F1 weekend. The prices seemed severely inflated. The service was good. We sat outside which was okay until they turned on blasting music; too loud. But the $264 dollars we ended up paying was off the charts for what we had ordered. Be careful.
/user_details?userid=Z4KJFsfbGOI_Y_betFy_4w,Gregory D.,"Palo Alto, CA",4 star rating,"This is a nice sophisticated restaurant with an ""international"" cuisine, meaning that it is good for business entertaining.  You can bring arbitrary guests here and be pretty sure they will find something appropriate (which is pretty typical for a good hotel restaurant).  There is always a vegetarian dish and a fish dish, both of which are typically very good.The place has a very nice ambiance, excellent service, and provides a pretty quick turn-around at lunch time, or even dinner time.  There is also an express menu  at lunch time that has a nice variety of items, an interesting collection of tastes, and which comes quite fast, including a selection of small desserts."

/user_details?userid=rwJH9oQChbHdYI640P_mgg,Julien D.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"When it comes to restaurants within hotels, I am not usually a huge fan. Unless we are talking palace and hi end cuisine.Somehow it is hard for me to judge the Renoir as I have only had a brunch there. But I must admit, what a brunch. This is probably one of the best brunch Montreal has. And if you still have room for desert, well they have the best ""millefeuilles"" you will ever encounter. And trust me as I am usually not a big fan of them. You will find an array of amazing deserts, but not only as the buffet grants you the possibility of a healthy brunch as much as a decadent one.So basically, if you are in need of a nice brunch, be assured that you have. A nice spot right here at the Renoir.The only thing that could be improved is probably the setting of the restaurant. Indeed more than the setting, it's mainly the furniture that kind of makes me not over excited.  This is true for not only for the Sofitel hotels, but for most hotels that tend to rely on furnitures that are really of average quality, and that brings a spirit of ""cheapness"" to the places. Unfortunately, over affordable solutions, often from China, seduces way to many hotels around the globe, and in the end it shows."

Mom loves the Belgian waffles as do I, love the  chocolate sauce and the vanilla cream, I tried the apple/strawberry puree for the 1st time.The duck legs confit were tasty & lean as was the roast beef. I enjoyed the novel service of the poached salmon made with star anise & cinnamon. The snow crab leg was so fresh it was sweet.For me the star of the meal is often the dessert - it was today I tried all six; lemon meringue tart, mille-feuille made with both custard & cream, choux pastry filled with cream, a chocolate mousse creation with caramel & passion fruit, a fruit mousse verrine a composite of raspberry, blood orange mandarin and pistachio; accompanied by the french pressed coffee.I kid you not when I say I short of rolled out of there.The service as always was professional and attentive."
/user_details?userid=CdOQhyqvef_8Ynf-1LhgGw,Sohail M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Our group of 6 adults and 2 kids went there on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Service was excellent and worthy of a Sofitel restaurant. We got pampered with white linen service, and the kids got to eat pretty much anything they wanted, even if it wasn't on the menu. Décor was modern and beautiful. Would surely have given this a five star rating, except it was pricey, so I equated that with the service, but took a point off for a lack of creativity on the menu. The eggs benedict I had was good but comparable to much cheaper places, the scrambled eggs my wife ordered was once again nothing exceptional. Safe to say its best to come here if you want to impress someone or have a quite conversation (our group was the loudest in the restaurant :) Would recommend this place on the mood of the day (do you want to feel like royalty for a couple hours or not? hehe), convenience i.e. staying at or near Sofitel like we were or just to say that you ate there :) Lunch and / or dinner may be quite different so cannot comment on that."

We ordered the duck poutin, very fresh but you must have a stomach for rich food. We also ordered the beef ribs which were Asian inspired and nice. A bit on the salty side but tasty. All in all the food and service were good but the bill is pricey for what you eat.Came back for breakfast the next morning and had a lovely server. We ate eggs Benedict and yogurt with berries and granola, all amazing. French press coffee was done right. The bill was very pricey for breakfast for 2 as was dinner last night."

The food was amazing. I had the rabbit dish and he had the lamb. Both meals were cooked to perfection. For dessert, we enjoyed a banana pudding encased  a rich dark chocolate shell. The staff was attentive and warm. The help to make our stay in Montreal a truly memorable one."

With the lovely weather we opted for exterior seating. I ventured for prix fixe and everyone else went a la carte. Very delicious wine by glass options though pricey.Everything was inventive French inspired well prepared perfectly seasoned. My fois gras starter had enough interesting variants on the side  to transform the tried and true but ever delicious simple sauté of fresh fois.My rib eye steak  was a simple but beautiful rendition.My dinner companions had the rabbit and a seafood combo plate. All dishes reminded me of some tasty newer style restaurants I have visited often in Paris and French country side.The bad Perhaps for price point would have liked a little bit nicer exterior option. Wine list smaller than expected for this price point. Overall for a restaurant I had not seen in too many top Montreal lists ,I would highly recommend as romantic destination for interior dining. I really was quite surprised it has not been more on the radar especially after my visit to much talked about Au Pieds( see my review)."
