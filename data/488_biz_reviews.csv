/user_details?userid=7LwNP-TCe1-pevp6KjYIPQ,Dan G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fun experience - good foodI went here for my son's birthday because he wanted to relive some of his childhood memories of eating teppanyaki. (Food cooked on a hot grill in front of you). I love the fact that it is a set menu including soup, salad, main course, tea and dessert for about $30. The salad dressing they use is very tasty and I wish I could buy a bottle of it for my home. It also includes shrimp appetizers. The 3 of us tried different main courses (chicken, steak, filet) and all three were cooked to perfection and delicious. Dessert is is 2 choices of ice cream so nothing exceptional but it tasted authentic and no freezer burn taste. It was fun watching the chef do his thing in front of you but the show did not live up to the memories.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…"

/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I don't have any complaints about this location. The salad dressing before you start is delicious and when I say delicious I mean the best out of all this grilling places.Can't go wrong with the shrimp and beef or lobster tail and chicken teriyaki.Can't cope without sake or a Sapporo.Haven't been in ages I miss this spot can't wait to come on by!

Always entertaining, kids enjoy watching the chef, and I have never been disappointed when it comes to the food. This place is my favourite place to go and I always go every year for my birthday and for my mothers birthday !"

/user_details?userid=h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,Jill M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Came here for a friends birthday. We were a group of 9 people all seated at the same table.  The food was very good and overall i had a nice experience. The cook was funny and highly entertaining.  Definitely will be coming back here.
/user_details?userid=4InQPZ5xc4rZMRxDGYdJZw,Alpa S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"bit pricey but great for groups. Not sure if it's good for dates. Food: teriyaki chicken was great! Shimps and beef were ok. It's just salt-pepper and soy sauce in cooked food. No special spices/exotic ingredients. Portions are ok, too. 3 starts just because it's entertainment else i'd have given this 1 star based on just food."
/user_details?userid=Mvs4_S_Klo-aiR12keyAYQ,Steeven L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel. My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get sushi here, the main attraction is the Teppanyaki.As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show."

/user_details?userid=2bfpsTEAuAsY93ELDBVr_A,Orly R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great staff, great location and great food.The chefs are amazing and make the experience memorable. Great Japanese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date or even a party."
/user_details?userid=rdrbizbKmClF3M2t11XxFA,Sara L.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,"I  have been going to this place regularly for over ten years. It is consistently awesome. I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  In terms of the ""show"" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive. This place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal. I highly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=xve9Sb8bx1Aid0313rYUQQ,Chen L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Showed up to a place less then 20% full. Guess it was Monday night. Waited 40mins before chef came to cook for us and only after I went to the manager to complaint. Chef quickly came, cooked out meal within 15mins and we were done in the same amount of time. Definitely not repeating due to mediocre food with little to no selection. The staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20% filled restaurant on the chef being slow! Good way to throw your chefs under the bus."
/user_details?userid=luxGSQ8kNf7Q00DyBrLCgw,Tim R.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"It's always a fun time with the food cooked in front of you. Nice quality and decently healthy... Price point is a bit high, but it's fun from time to time."
/user_details?userid=Lj4aiPE5RRIn5m1zgKSIQQ,Tarushka S.,"Cote Saint-Luc, Canada",4 star rating,"Bring a sweater and leggings/pants with you, because this place is freezing! There's something wrong with their ventilation/air-conditioning system. It might be warmer if you sit next to the grill.The sushi is always good but I've never had the grill. It's a great place to get together with friends, family or colleagues for any group event. Children's birthday parties are celebrated a lot here. I plan on celebrating mine here in September."
/user_details?userid=8Wx_X23YvD84kmeI5ie-jw,John D.,"Washington, DC",1 star rating,"Worst experience I've ever had at not only a Japanese steakhouse, but any restaurant short of mcdonalds.  Went there yesterday evening and sat down.  10 minutes go by before anyone arrives to take our drink order.  Another 10 minutes.  Drinks come and we order our food.  Sit and wait another 15 minutes.  Soup arrives.  15 minutes later, salad arrives.  20 minutes after that we walk out.  45 minutes and never saw a chef. There were maybe 4 parties in the entire place and only 1 party when we finally had had enough.  Do not eat here."
/user_details?userid=6YPfM_xcWZM4GjBvGvL8Mg,Alfonse D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,It is not just a meal ... It is fun evening with a delicious food and a great presentation .I gave it 4 star because it is not at the same level of Benihana in Toronto and the US.I believe it is the best available Japanese grill house in Montreal island .It is a bit expensive because of the location.
/user_details?userid=segRkXhf1vSCnEi_aHnGdg,Lauren Ashley S.,"Orange, CA",3 star rating,"Toyo, Toyo, Toyo... where do I begin. I was first introduced to this place 4 years ago, for my friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef/performer. I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward! I'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do."
/user_details?userid=TZPsABv-sMnreTLwLsg9xg,David B.,"Niagara Falls, NY",4 star rating,Had a great experience here. Our chef had lots of fun with the meal and put on a good show. Food was fantastic and a large portion. Great time all around.
/user_details?userid=qF7WxFRdMTHdv8s1wfXPYQ,Erin G.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I was unimpressed. The restaurant was almost empty and yet the service was still slow. When we were served the waiter got the order wrong. The portions were also very small, especially for the price. I understand that in restaurants like this you're also paying for the experience, but the experience was lackluster. There was very little flair to the cooking process and our chef was not engaging at all. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Take your money and spend it on a restaurant with better quality service."
