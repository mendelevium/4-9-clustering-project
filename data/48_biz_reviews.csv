/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with a group of friends. I've been wanting to come here for a while. They have a nice selection of wines, Asian beers, and cocktails to choose from. I went for a Japanese beer. For food I started with an order of vegetarian imperial rolls. These were really good...nice and crispy on the outside with great flavour on the inside. They're served with a good dipping sauce too. For the main course, I went with a large beef Pho, with extra braised beef. It was a nice sized soup, but I was hoping for a little more beef and noodles inside. The soup did have a terrific taste though. Although for the price of the soup ($16 + $4 for the extra beef), I was hoping to be a little more full! Service was definitely top notch. They take good care of you while you're there. The only downside is that it's probably a little more expensive than it needs to be. But still a good night out and everyone enjoyed their food."

The food was absolutely delicious and flavourful. My absolute favorites were the spicy beef tataki salad and the pork buns (you could see both in my pictures), and I'll most likely order both next time I go. I also liked the shiso leaf appetizer and the pork imperial rolls, but I wasn't as crazy about them. The service was great too. All of the things our waitress suggested we liked. My only critique is the price. For the price that you pay, I find the portions to be small and it is very easy to rack up a big bill, especially if you are hungry. I would have easily rated this restaurant 5 stars if the prices were a little cheaper or the portions a little bigger."

It a tapas style kind of restaurant with a variety of cocktail. I'd say definitely reserve because the weekends are very crowded. We arrived there at 8 and by 9 there were people waiting at the door. This is more of a Asian fusion restaurant and the dishes are not super authentic but very tasty nonetheless."
/user_details?userid=7BypYgbi8ur5jRQMsRcMHQ,Jil M.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Came here for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night. Service was good and the food was delicious. We got the pork & shrimp buns, the spring roll & the tartare -- the steamed buns definitely stole the show but the whole meal was great. After, we headed downstairs to Nhau -- by that time the bar was busy and we had to hover for a bit but a table opened up pretty quickly. Beautiful ambiance and great music. We ordered fairly quickly but somehow our drink order got lost in the mix -- it happens. Our server was wonderful and brought us a couple of shots to apologize for the wait. When the drinks did arrive, they were good.  Only word of warning, that if you have asthma or any issues with smoke, they do burn quite a bit of incense downstairs (or at least they did the night were were there), and it gets pretty smoky."
/user_details?userid=L_BfX60OabNkEIBjUfOJMw,Khan V.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",4 star rating,Really good food. You feel the Asian origin in every taste. A great place for a romantic dinner. A lot of conversation if you don't mind the noise.
/user_details?userid=R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited this place in both locations, Mont Royal and Vieux Port. Both restaurant have the same food menu, both have an amazing terasse and both have an amazing and fast service. I tryed the dinner menu at the Mont Royal twice and the selection is very big: a choice of soup, cold and hot dishes. The buns are amazing and you can only find them on the dinner menu.For lunch and at both locations ,they offer the table d'hote at a very convenient price. I always start with the Soupe Coco. It's an amazing soup. Then I often order those tasty vegetarian spring rolls. As main course, I tried the coconut salmon, a very light and parfumated taste. Their Pad Thai is a home made (done from scratch), so you know that you wont be able to compare it to any of the other Pad Thai you will find in Montreal. My recommendations for the main course is the Grilled 1855 Beef, Satay Sauce, Crispy Brocoli. Its a mouthwatering piece of meat, with fried brocoli, a sauce that is to die for and at the end of your meal you feelthat you had something different and yet very fulling. Their dessert are fine. I suggest you try to taste everything on the menu. It is a place I would go every time I need to have some exotic gateway. Also for a 5@7, their drink are amazing, a different taste everytime, in a very nice and modern decor. This place is a coup de coeur."

I'm not usually a big fan of vietnamese but honestly, this changed my mind. Everything was fresh and new. I got the crunchy tofu and the porc spring rolls, i burned my tongue because I was trying to eat everything as it arrived at my table. The tofu came with this really fluffy and tasty coating of crunchy-ness and sauce. The spring rolls were indescribably delicious. I highly recommend ordering them.  My family ordered different meals so I got to taste the pad thai and the coconut salmon as well and those meals made me wish I had more stomach space. Unfortunately, the terrace was full when we arrived so we had to sit inside. However, the interior is so modern and chic that I didn't mind at all. My family and I had a great time! It's a really great restaurant for a nice flavourful and laid back dinner."

I ordered the porks buns and they were gone in literally 5 minutes. The menu was a bit pricey for what it was which kind of turned me off. It was a nice place to host my friend's birthday dinner and their drinks were really good. I highly recommend getting those if you do want to drink something!"

/user_details?userid=m5fNVWQFfgOj-sAXBxeBSw,Marcus S.,"South Orange, NJ",4 star rating,"This is definitely a spot to come for an evening with friends and it showed. Upbeat music with outdoor seating with those patio party lights. Inside its mote dimly lit, music lounge tans it's a bit a stuffy. Food and service though? Awesome. Pad thai was surprisingly good, full of flavor, nice big crispy shrimp and a fair portion. It wasn't as spicy as I expected but that may have been for the better as the flavor itself is present throughout. The pad thai was to have braised pork but I only could taste it in a few bites which was kind of a let down. The salad was ok all present, I tried some the veggie bowl, but thought is was a bit high, although again the portion was fair. Still really good and a unique take on the entrees but not the best Vietnamese I've had. The outdoor ambience with friends I think is the big draw, I'd say 3.5-4 stars."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This cute place has a small terrace in front of the restaurant. It also seems to be very popular with locals and visitors. It's not your typical Asian food restaurant, it's little bit more upscale, the portions are smaller and more expensive than what you could find in Chinatown. That being said, their tartare is amazing, the food is simply delicious. The service is friendly and attentive as well, so despite the price, I would definitely go back there again."
/user_details?userid=zbpP28M6g0YHaaIJ6ZP2Xg,Elise B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hà is hands down one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Montreal (and also one of my favorite restaurants period).My friend Claire and I went for a weekday lunch, as my friend had mentioned they have a lunch special.Indeed, for lunch, you basically get a free starter with a select choice of meals (about 7 options). I often order the beef pho, but had been disappointed the last time I went, so I opted for the cold octopus salad as a main and the mini laksa as a starter.Both dishes were amazing and so delicious. The laksa was seasoned to perfection and very tasty. As for the octopus salad, just wow. The dish was beautifully plated first of all and the combination of flavours, fresh ingredients and spices was just perfect.I highly recommend Hà to anyone looking for a great Asian meal with a bit of a twist, either for lunch or dinner. Hà is a great spot to try with friends, family or with your partner.For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"

The atmosphere was cosy, the service fast and the food delicious. It is a little on the pricey side but you won't leave feel hungry. The price of the dish dictates its portion size!"
/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had really high expectation after looking through Instagram and Yelp about the restaurant. To be honest, I was debating between giving a 3 or a 4 stars because their food didn't ""wow"" me. I decided to give a 3.5/5.I think it is a pleasant place to have a meal. It is situated in front of a park and they have a patio where you can enjoy the summer breeze. I highly recommend the patio seats as it seems brighter than the interior seats (I didn't go in but it seemed quite dark inside). I also noticed people prefer the patio seats, so if you can, try to get there early. We got there at 6pm and the patio was almost filled up even if it was a Wednesday night.The service was friendly and fast. In fact, a waiter came to fill up our cups even when the water bottle was on our table already. However, our waitress didn't told us what was the dishes of the day. We had to listen to another waitress telling it to another table in order to figure out what they were.The menu is quite simple. They have soups, buns, appetizers, hot dishes and desserts. I wouldn't say they have a large selection of items (if I compare it to other Asian/Vietnamese restaurant). But there is plenty of dishes to pick from. I had a hard time picking what I wanted to eat! They also have a cocktail menu!I settled down for their pad thai, as I'm a big pad thai lover. I noticed the little spicy icon next to ""pad thai"" so I asked our waitress if it was possible to make it not spicy. But she said they can make it less spicy, which I was fine with. My friend went with their laksa soup, which also had the spicy icon (but she can eat spicy, so it didn't bother her).We didn't wait too long before having our dishes. My pad thai came with 4 big crispy shrimps. I don't think I've ever had pad thai with crispy shrimps elsewhere, so I was really excited to try it! There were also pork cutes inside my dish. I'm really glad I went with a less spicy pad thai because the more I ate it, the spicier it became. Their pad thai was more on the sour-side. It was an okay/decent dish but quite pricey I find ($18 before tax and tips). I had a sip of my friend's laksa soup and it wasn't spicy at all. She had to add a lot of Sriracha sauce in her bowl to make it spicy. We both agreed the soup was a bit bland and somehow it tasted a bit like pho broth to me.Before we left the restaurant, the table next to us' order just arrived. Their beef pho smelled SO good! Next time I go, I would probably try it (although it is more expensive -$14- than the other pho restaurants in Montreal). Their buns, coconut salmon, BBQ ribs and grilled beef also looked delicious from the pictures on Instagram and Yelp."
/user_details?userid=2d2qfAlBXSxcIpqu067_4w,Heidi L.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"This place rocks. It is simply delicious. We were starving and ordered 6 things off the menu and munched our way throughout the evening. We sat outside on their lovely patio with candlelight. While all the dishes were yummy, the crab buns were outstanding. I highly recommend this place. The attention to detail, the consistency, and the beauty of each dish was memorable. Bravo."
/user_details?userid=GCyF7g55m4Zg7EcOwq7-9g,Michelle W.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Saw a review for one of the best salad rolls in Montreal. As a sucker for Vietnamese food, I had to come try it. Instead of ordering salad rolls, I ordered a papaya salad, chef wings, and the grilled beef dish - and yes, this is all for myself. Papaya salad was blend, lacked acidity from limes, and the unique flavors of fish sauce. Despite asking for extra spicy for the wings, they were barely any heat. I might have a high spice tolerant, but I know what's spicy for a normal person. The only thing I enjoyed was the beef. The broccoli was lightly battered, beef was medium rare (though the cut wasn't the best), and the additional fish sauce with peanuts that added a punch to both the beef and vegetables. I wish they could have had that sauce for the papaya salad. The restaurant is hipster, with communal tables inside and a patio outside. I hated parking around the area because it's all permit only, except for meters along the front streets, which were fully occupied during dinner time."

The room is beautiful, I love the light and decor and the service was friendly. It's comfortable and elegant and not too fussy and it's location across from the park is dreamy. The food didn't blow me away but I did like the pad thai I had with it's super soft and savoury pork, the ingredients all tasted fresh and clean and delicate. (I know, not a good authentic choice for a Vietnamese place but I had a craving.) I would love to go back to try some of their delicious sounding cocktails. One of my dining companions was pretty bummed by the broth in her soup so I'd avoid that and explore more of the small plates next time."
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,What a perfect place for a lunch on the terrace. And in the evening the perfect place to eat and have a nice glass of wine. Everything on the menu is very well done. Explore a new dish and trust them to do it well. The rolls are a must as an entrée and the soup is great. Really I trust them so much the last time I was there I ordered a fried rice dish that could be boring or too commercial and it was amazing. Last point the service is usually exceptional. That is all.

Wings, pho, pad thai, papaya salad all came up WAY short. One consistent theme, bland. Wings, WAY too sweet. Broccoli was good.

/user_details?userid=jwBm39I1a-A_jvJeZR-_EA,Gary C.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"More 2.5 stars. Really more of a Vietnamese Fusion if thats what you want to call it.  If you know and love authentic Vietnamese cuisine then this will not cut it. We had gone strictly because were meeting a celebration party and the group had decided on this restaurant. We all settled on a prefixed menu at $40 per person. Starts with Edamame with a delicious seasoning. Then it starts to go down hill. Some kind of a papaya mango salad that was too spicy and soggy! Almost everyone (11 out of 15) said the same. Next was sliced beef with stale shrimp chips! The beef was tasty but all the accompanying green salad and shrimp chips were again soggy. Then imperial rolls that were supposed to be wrapped in lettuce leafs for dipping. The lettuce, mint leaves, and cilantro had seen better days. Instead if being fresh crisp lettuce it looked like they had been sitting out and wilted. The main dishes of 2 shrimps and some pork in a pad thai was  overcooked and way too soft! 3 other couples said the same thing. The Salmon was the last on the service and that was not bad. The meal took so long to come out it was 3.5 hours into the night and it was 11 pm. Desert was supposed to be part of the meal but when we asked they told us the kitchen was closed! Not impressed with the meal so far everyone just went with the flow and said our fair wells!All in all if you want a $$$""hipster Vietnamese fusion"" experience and you're not fussy about eating ""mushy"" Pad Thai then you picked the right place! Our bill came out to $115.00 with a diet coke! Seriously this is way too much for what we got."
/user_details?userid=JQM-lulAGTAwyKhKkcnshA,Mimosa V.,"Waterloo, Canada",4 star rating,"Pros: Nice seating, Outdoor patio, Fusion food Cons: Service, Prices-Ambiance- A nice place to grab lunch or dinner if you're in the mood for Viet food with a bit of a twist. The service for us was not so great but we could have overlooked that. We had the lunch menu and it offered a good variation. The prices range from 10-28$ for lunch. Tbh a bit pricey for a  Vietnamese person who's use to paying less/nothing for her people's food. -Food-Coconut Soup: It came with the lunch, you had a choice of soup or papaya salad, I thought it was OK nothing too great. Think of a thai coconut red curry in a lighter soup version with some noodles. Thai Papaya Salad: This was a solid app, the fresh vegetables are mixed in a well balanced and flavoured sauce. Lacked a little spiciness kick that I'm use to. Banh Mì: Ok, so I am use to paying 3$ for banh mi so when we ordered this for 14$ I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately that was not the case, don't get me wrong it was good but I expected more for the price. The bread is grilled and the whole sandwich was warm. Catch of the Day aka Octopus /Pieuvre:  The dish that saved this place from 3 star rating, so you should kinda get it.  It was a serving of grilled octopus served with asparagus, watercress and other vegetable mix. The octopus was tender and well marinated. The dish really did keep true to Vietnamese flavours, from the octopus marinade to the salad vinaigrette to the side dipping sauce. A dish worth its price and worth a revisit. -Overall- A step up in price and ambiance from your usual Viet cozy/crazy restaurants. You're paying for a prettier seating plan and a twist on flavours."
/user_details?userid=SfNfXuYfLxywOtgf2mYoJA,Lisa B.,"Tampa, FL",4 star rating,This restaurant was a recommendation by another restaurant that was booked - which was lovely of them to share. Try the wings! The Green Tea ice cream! The Octopus was pretty good but a tad bit over cooked - a MOST common thing. Still - it was NOT rubber like is often the case! The space is beautiful and the wait staff was delightful. Oh! And the spicy edamame was delish too! It is quiet enough that you can have a conversation and while it is listed as Vietnamese - it was more like Asian fusion to my way of thinking. A very lovely evening.

We also had the salmon with coconut and the pad Thai, which were also delicious. The tapioca desert was kind of strange, but good. Great service as well in this small resto in The Plateau."
/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I was verrry curious about Ha when it first opened on Mont Royal. I finally tried it with a friend of mine last week for lunch. At first, we were disappointed with the limited lunch menu compared to the extensive dinner menu online. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Lunch includes a soup or papaya salad so here's what we ordered in the end: 1. Coconut soup - SO flavourful. Exactly the mix of tangy, creamy and salty with a kick from a Southeast Asian soup. 2. Imperial rolls - We shared the deep fried rolls with veggies and fish sauce on the side. Really tasty! 3. Catch of the Day: Grilled octopus with rice and watercress salad - The combo of all three were perfect in this dish... The smokiness from the grill, the sesame from the rice and the acidity from the salad with watercress and pickled onions. 4. Five spice shrimp - You can never really go wrong with anything five-spice, and this shrimp did not disappoint. It's super satisfying and goes very well with the rice and sauteed veggies on the side. Most DEFINITELY would recommend Ha for lunch! I will definitely be coming back for their dinner menu on a pleasant evening to sit on their terrace!"

Service was attentive and quick. We got the Laska soup and pad Thai to share, but the winning dish was the surf and turf crispy rice salad. Woah. The rice had a meaty flavor and was crunchy along the bottom and the beef was cooked perfectly. It came along a side of basil salad and pickled veggies. Cocktails were also a hot. I got a version of the Aperol spritz and it was perfectly balanced."

We ordered tom yum with shrimp and a salmon tartare. The shrimp was really the star. They were tasty, plump, and fresh! The salmon tartare was tasty but forgettable. The portions were dinky for the price. The only reason I was conflicted about the three or four star rating was the terrace. It overlooked Mont Royal Park on a beautiful Sunday afternoon after France won the World Cup. The québécois were turnt and we appreciated their joie de vivre (I think?!)"

/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was very good in my opinion, but I'm not going back and here's why:- It's too dark to properly see your food; they have these annoyingly trendy light bulbs that colour everything in orange, but really barely give out enough light, and they are also warm, which brings me to the next reason not to go there:- It's super warm inside; apparently the a/c ""just broke down"". I was sweating through the entire meal. - The acoustics is really bad; I found it very hard to converse with background music, chatter, bar and kitchen noise (and we were as far away from the bar as possible - near the entrance).It could be nicer on the terrace, but today was rainy and anyhow terrace season is almost over. - It's pricey for what it was. We paid over $30 a person, and didn't get that much food. The beer pitcher was indecently small (enough for 3 glasses only).In short, a disappointment."

First of all, the decor looks great. I went there with a friend on a friday night and, even if the restaurant looked packed, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. I ordered the pad thai and a beer. It was good, but I thought it was a little bit too much to make us us pay 21$ for a simple pad thai. Don't get me wrong, it was better than your typical thai corner restaurants, but still, it could have been cheaper. This is the main reason why I'm only giving 3 stars.  I have to admit that I would still go back to try other things from their menu and see if the rest is really worth the kinda high prices."

Those chicken wings really took me back to those summer days in Vietnam, that pairs absolutely well with their house draft beer. However, their food seems to be lacking the spicy punch to some of their items in their menu, thus I would suggest to ask for the chef to add a bit more spice. or maybe, i just enjoy spicy foods in general. Overall, the atmosphere of the place is very pleasurable, good for friends, or for a chill date with the bae....and yes I would definitely go back again! #tresbon"

The kind of place where you can shut down your eyes, point to a coupe of things on the menu, and no matter what it is, it will be delicious. You want to be amazed and surprised? Try the buns. I have been thinking about the buns again for several days, imagining the texture in my mouth, wondering how they make it so moist, and how they give the ""bread"" this black color?!

It's definitely not the normal, casual vietnamese restaurant you're used to. We had the edamame with herbs & lime, and the crispy tofu to share. As the main dish I had the Hà's Pad Thai with braised pork & crispy shrimp, which was fantastic. It's a little bit more expensive than the normal vietnamese food you get but definitely worth it."

The coconut salmon was excellent - highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=dctu_FcNlLCUOVSxIr9iLg,Sladjana D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here last night with a friend. I was drawn to the simple and intimate terrasse- I love the ambiance! However you will have to wait a long time to be seated outside if you don't have a reservation. We placed our name on the waiting list and had to wait 30 mins (and also saw our table given away to people who had arrived after us, grr!). We ordered the salmon tartar spring roll as as an appetizer - I didn't love it, it had a perfume-y aftertaste. We ordered the pork and shrimp pad Thai as an entree and it was a winner! Super tasty and a good portion size - but not for people who don't like spicy food. If you want to eat well but not break the bank I would definitely suggest getting the pad Thai. I would recommend Ha for a nice warm evening on the terrasse....with a reservation."

I sat at the bar which was great, because the bartender was very friendly. Nice cocktail menu and a small but diverse selection of east Asian beers to pair with the food.I ordered the green papaya salad and the salmon tartare spring roll. They were brought to me at the same time, which was a minor annoyance, but fine. The papaya salad was so tasty, but just ever so slightly overdressed. The spring roll was fine. The salmon was fresh and it was plated beautifully, but for the price I was hoping for something a bit bigger. I definitely want to go back and try some of their more traditional Vietnamese options; it was just way too hot for phō.Overall, slightly pricey for what it is, but the food is yummy and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming."

/user_details?userid=WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ,Gillian T.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Had wanted to try this place for a while, but even the good reviews I'd read couldn't draw me up to the Plateau during the brutally cold first two months of 2015. We finally ventured out tonight and were not disappointed.Re reservations, we called this afternoon and got the recorded message that we should email, which we did. We got a call back about half an hour later offering us a 6pm or 8.30pm table for 2. There was in fact quite a lot of space when we got there at 8.30, with a free table for 6, and several tables for 2. The restaurant was in fact maybe 70% full.I liked the decor, which I found simple and tasteful. I particularly liked that they have hooks for your coats, especially since I had been saying just a couple of days previously that I don't understand why all Montreal cafés and restaurants don't have cloakrooms/coat hooks.And so to the food: We tried the papaya salad and pork buns for starters, and followed with the lemongrass ribs and the catch of the day, which was grilled arctic char served with a coconut milk and curry sauce and accompanied by sweet potato noodles and shredded daikon.The papaya salad was good but not as spicy as Satay Brothers. The pork buns were really good. I loved that they were black (from squid ink), and the sauce on the pork was excellent. It was a typical Asian taste that I find hard to describe - a touch of sweetness and a tad of sourness, with neither taste overwhelming the other. And there was just the right amount so that it was succulent, risked oozing from the bun, but didn't make it soggy.The arctic char was really, really good. I expected way more sauce, but in fact there was really just a touch to set the perfectly grilled fish off. The noodles and daikon had the a couple of Thai Basil leaves on top, but I felt that they would have been better shredded and mixed in. It was just missing a little something to make it an excellent dish.The lemongrass ribs had been slow-cooked sous vide (vacuum cooked) and the meat (a good amount of it) fell off the bone easily and completely. They were a nice change from barbecue or spicy flavours, fresh and tangy in taste. They were served, or rather, decorated with a few slices of vegetables and edamame in a lemony sauce.We washed it all down with beer. I tried the Bia Hoi on draft (they also have Boreale and a selection of imported bottles of Asian beer). The Bia Hoi is a lager with a nice golden colour and fine bubbles. I'd expected something more German in style so it was a nice surprise.The service: We were a tad late and the restaurant called me to see whether they should wait for us or could give our table away. I didn't think anything of it till I got there and found there were plenty of tables. :-/ We were served with water quickly and got our menus shortly after, but I had to ask what the catch of the day was. The waiter was friendly and the service was prompt.The bill was very reasonable at just under $75 for two."

/user_details?userid=TLwP7EWKiD8Sbr_dm3BysQ,Cyril C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Initially I was worried when I saw the number of menu items offered. Then I understood that this restaurant chose quality over quantity. The food is great, the service perfect and the price seems impossible (appetizer and main dish for 14$ at lunch time). I am curious to find out if the menu is renewed on a regular basis. I will soon find out since this will be my new spot in the neighbourhood."

/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"No. You can't reasonably charge 45$ for two plates of sautéed veggies and rice that aren't even on par with those greasy Thai express take-away. At least the kitchen closes ""late"" (10:30)"

It was EXTREMELY warm in Hà, almost unbearably so, but the food and alcohol made up for it! Drinks were on point. Food made your mouth start drooling as soon as it was served. I can honestly say I can't wait to go back!"

/user_details?userid=XmGcSDOILFVceIT4hkb0rQ,Rhonda K.,"Henderson, NV",1 star rating,"""HA HA"" on us! My experience dining at this restaurant started with trying to find a parking spot on a Sunday night at 7:00pm. Parking was very challenging and I circled for half an hour trying to find one. Finally found one a 15 minute walk away from the restaurant.  I was referred to this restaurant by a neighbor.  Very bad decision. The food and staff was terribly disappointing.  It started out quick but then very long gap between appetizers and main courses. I ordered a glass of wine, (waitress never came back to see if another one was wanted during my meal). She forgot to order/serve the jasmine rice we ordered and it came towards the end of the meal. Asked for soy sauce and she forgot to bring it, and eventually, after a second request another waiter brought it. Lots of staff, but  grabbing a staff member was trying, as they run back and forth from inside to outside. (Made for far from a relaxing meal when you are seated near the entrance.) Upon seeing previous reviews, we ordered the pad thai with crispy shrimp. There was nothing crispy about the shrimp! It arrived with 4 shrimps (3 were RAW) and the pad thai noodles were soft and overcooked. Manager offered to make us more shrimp but we declined. We were already there a long time and  it was terribly hot inside, with no fan in site. When the waitress brought the bill, she placed it on the table saying that something else was coming from the kitchen. The restaurant offered us as compensation a $7.00 tapioca, fruit and nut desert.  The $19.00 pad thai with shrimp dish remained on the bill. I was stunned. They should have removed the pad thai and shrimp dish from the bill AND given us the desert complimentary! They made a very poor choice trying to keep this customer satisfied, and unfortunately, we did too by choosing to dine here. They should be ashamed of themselves for not taking the shrimp and pad thai dish off our bill. We could NOT eat it! I will be posting a review on trip advisor as well."

/user_details?userid=U01NvkeKgPNH8TlmQRY9-Q,Doug F.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Making a reservation on line was very easy, parking not so much. Went there because of recent positive review in the Gazette. Imperial roll was very greasy, and had no taste. Pad Thai was pretty good, but when you order something that's supposed to be spicy and it's not, it's frustrating. My wife had one of the soups, almost no protein in the broth. For us it's all about how tasty the food is, and at this place it's not."
/user_details?userid=Il3FejoMTG4BODfg9gJA3Q,Sarah B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The terrasse is pretty on a summer's night - it's lit with string lights and filled with flowers. Definitely would sit outside if you can (no resos taken for the terrasse, but you can sit at the bar and wait for a spot to open up). As for food, I'd recommend the black buns with shrimp, the spicy chicken wings, and the pad thai. It's a little pricey for the portion size, but the food is delicious. They also have interesting cocktails - twists on classics like the old fashioned and the Aperol spritz."

/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was difficult to rate Hà but I've settled with 3 stars and will come back with a recap after I return for dinner. We went at 2:30pm and the lunch had just finished so there were only 4 things available on the menu; a pho soup, imperial rolls, shrimp chips and edamame. The service was terrible. The staff barely even noticed we were there. The waitress mixed up our simple order of one soup, one spring roll and never brought us cutlery or napkins, I had to get up and retrieve them myself. It's one thing if she said ""oops I forgot cutlery"" as she laid the food down, but to walk away and ignore, and make your customer work, is a big no-no. The soup was really good. It came with no accoutrements (or perhaps they were forgotten too) but the broth was flavourful, the noodles were heavenly and the meat tasted like filet mignon. The spring/imperial rolls were, well, one small fried roll- for a hefty price. But good. In all, good food, a bit expensive and bad service. I will come back though, for a dinner service, and update."
/user_details?userid=nfXK9ZBp5B4GhixgDVVxcw,Antoine N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great great experience at this establishment. Came with a group of friends (we are all vietnamese, most born and raised) and I have to say this restaurant is among the few in montreal that really nails the Hanoi flavor in their Pho (of course we tried the Pho). We each ordered different dishes on the menu (which has both authentic vietnamese and fusion-esque dishes) and everything was amazing. The highlight of all the courses was the Squid ink pork belly buns, which was delicious. The staff was very gracious, even though the place was packed we weren't rushed or anything. Overall we had a great time, def would come back again!"
