If you like Middle Eastern cuisine, this place needs to be added to your list!I was in a group of 4 and we shared 1kg mixed Mirage grill (10 brochettes of kafta, beef,chicken). It also came with fries, along with a pita stuffed with meat and a type of pizza on pita (sorry, I don't know the names of the latter 2!). We also shared a Fatoush salad and some hummus. The food was phenomenal. The marinade on the meats was delicious. I just kept wanting more despite being stuffed! Everything we ate was delicious. I will 100% be back."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried the mixed mirage platter with a side of fatoush. The fries with the garlic sauce were amazing. The salad and rice were pretty good as well. The meat were also decent but they were a bit dry. Adding garlic sauce on it definitely made it better. As for the service, there wasn't much service today. After giving our order, we never got any water until we asked for it and they give u a pitcher of water and you pour it yourself. Other than that, the food came quickly and the girls were nice. The place is clean and nicely decorated. We spent around 20$ each and were full."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was craving hummus and falafel and I got lucky finding this restaurant in the new year vacation period. The plates are small but the quality is on top! Hummus was extra creamy, I recommend getting the one with pine nuts. Everything is topped with the most delicious olive oil and you must get the home made freshly baked bread to savor all the dishes! The falafel didn't disappoint, it was fresh out of the frier, perfect size, not too big or too small. I recommend always having something fresh on the side, the fatoush salad for example: if you don't like mint you will come to love it!Overall super happy with the food, the service was OK too, it's more of a family style restaurant so don't expect it to be silent. Would come back again for that hummus anytime!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delightful cosy restaurant! The staff is indeed very nice. The decor is wonderful. If you're a group of six, ask for the booth seats in its own semi enclosed section. After your meal, you can also dress up in a garb called abaya, don on a tarboush hat and take a picture with your friends. The staff will gladly take the photo for you! The cuisine is mainly Syrian with some Lebanese items. Our waitress recommended that the 4 of us split the Mirage mixed platter with all sorts of grilled meats--lamb, chicken, kaftas, kabab, areyes kafta, roasted tomatoes, onions and a side of crispy coated French fries aaww yeeaa.  All really yummy, especially when slathered with garlic sauce. Only the chicken was a bit dry but the rest we gobbled up. This was more than enough and we had a bit of left overs.For the starters, we added the warm bread--sooo soft and squishy and so good with the hummus and eggplant dips. They also gave us a basket full of pita. They have olive oil that you can douse your dips with. The fattoush salad is classic and topped with crispy pita chips for a balanced meal :) Great place! Not too busy on a Sunday night. By 8pm, we were the only patrons left in the resto. Will definitely come by again!"

Everything is freshly cooked and prepared and come at a very reasonable price. We tried a plate with all the meats and chicken along with hummus and Taboule and all plates were super fresh and delicous. You should not expect the best service though!Make sure to end it with a red tea or turkish coffee
/user_details?userid=lyzHnDnL7ftTExMU8_cEjw,Amr H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Review during Covid-19: ordered online so can't tell about dine-in service. Delivery was fast as expected, we found grill prices exaggerated as others commented, so we ordered 1kg kofta. It was well done and delicious! Rice order should have been bigger for the price. All was v good except mankousha Nutella, which is rather a Nutella pizza. 5* -1 for that."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a find! My friend reserved this restaurant to celebrate her birthday. It is an absolute marvel. The decor inside, Middle Eastern look and feel. There is spot where you can wear the jacket/shawl with hat; to look like a Jordanians, and with the decorated background, we can take pictures. We had a lot of fun with it! The service was was excellent. Everyone is super friendly, helpful and patient with such a big group. My side of the table decided to order 1kg grilled meat. So we got kafta Kababs, shish taouks, filet mignons, fries, rice, grilled onions, tomatoes, taboule salad, hummus and pita. It was Food for 4 people. It was so delicious that there are no words to describe. For desert, watermelon was served and it was included. For all these food, divided by 4 people was 15$ each. Unbelievable! Here is the special surprise, I asked for a cake and candle for my friend, since it's her bday celebration... they did bring the cake but also the played the Happy Birthday song over the stereo, the whole restaurant knew it's her bday.... that was perfect.It's an amazing restaurant; excellent food, beautiful decor, and lovely service... it is a must!"
/user_details?userid=5CbfKqyOSe63xH6CJL9sSA,Maxine R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,"This was the first restaurant my family and i went to on a trip to Montreal. We weren't disappointed at all! There were four of us and we hadn't eaten all day and had come at about 3pm. The atmosphere was great, with beautiful stain glass lamps and cozy booths and seats. The woman who served us was patient and recommend the mirage mixed grilled platter which contained a sort of pizza looking pita bread (4), white rice (3 cups), and french fries (2 cups), along with various meats including chicken, beef, kofta, lamb chops. there was a side of white garlic sauce also on the side. All of this was about $54. This took about 25 minutes to be served. My family and i were EXTREMELY satisfied with out meal as it was filling and so so delicious!! my personal favorite was the kofta with the white garlic sauce. We also ordered a fatuoush salad and labneh with the bread that was already served free with our meal. We were satisfied with the labneh, but the fatuoush salad was a bit salty. Both of these dishes took about 15 minutes to be served. The reason i'm only giving this restaurant five stars is that for one, the service was quite bad. Although the server was kind in the beginning, not once did she check up on us. The staff seemed very scattered and busy, although there were very few people there at that time. Although, i would definitely come here again despite all of this, it was sooo worth it!ALSO: although above it says credit cards aren't accepted, they were."

/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far best service I've ever had at a restaurant! The staff was great, food arrived quickly and very helpful. We were complimentary fruits as dessert. I had a friend who came with her son who wasn't in the best mood. The restaurant provided her son fries ""on the house"". They have a little corner where you can try traditional middle eastern clothing, the decor is beautiful. Food was excellent. We were a large group and no one was disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=GpOtN5GAqfAMKRTXiYaJ-g,Nicole G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"We had an amazing experience at Mirage! It's open late, has beautiful decor, friendly staff and delicious food. I'm a vegetarian so Lebanese is one of my favorite cuisines, there are so many choices. The grilled halloumi, hummus, greek salad and falafel were all delicious. The pickled peppers were spicy and addictive, the olives were the only thing that we didn't love. My fiancé loved his chicken dish and couldn't stop raving about how perfectly the rice was cooked. The server that brought out the food was so happy that we were enjoying it and brought us out amazing fresh baked pillowy bread. I also love that they have freshly squeezed juices and wish I had a glass of watermelon in my hand right now."

/user_details?userid=4kuqP2sUBJYivpldCqTw1g,Anu R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,The best Syrian food we have eaten. The Manakish is a pizza. The one with thyme favored with sumac is by itself worth the visit here. The foul and balila and moutabel are in name similar to what you may find at a Lebanese place but the interpretation is Syrian and delightful. The balila is similar to the chickpea stuffing that goes with Indian bhel and is lightly flavored with black salt.  The house made pickles are a delight!

When it comes to food, it had the best fattoush I had in a restaurant in Canada (fattoush can be disappointing in restaurants). Excellent cheese manakeesh and amazing fatte. I feel like visiting Montreal again just to go there. Loved the place.It was an amazing experience."

A beautiful place with a lot of importance given to its interiors starting from the beautiful Moroccan lights to the Islamic art mosaics they have given a lot for the tiny details."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"After seeing such awesome reviews for Mirage I decided to stop by for dinner with a friend hoping that this was going to be a delicious Middle Eastern dinner. We arrived around 5:45 on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was completely dead. After looking at the menu, we decided to share a few dishes: fattouch (because it really is one of the hallmarks of excellent Lebanese/Syrian food if made well IMHO), hummus with meat, an order of freshly baked bread, the Mirage mixed grill which had a little bit of everything, and two lemon-mint juice orders. The juice came out first within minutes and it was delicious. This was followed by the hummus and bread which were also excellent. I had high hopes after these items but sadly my excitement deflated once we got the fattouch and meats. The fattouch was the weirdest one I've ever had with way too much sweetness and zero salt or acidity to balance it. We only ate half of the dish. The mixed meats were also a bust: all were way too dry and overcooked, the meat arayes had zero flavor, and there were no dipping sauces (garlic/hummus) that came with the plate which was a bit strange. The fries were delicious (Costco fries) but the rice was flavorless. When I asked to see the dessert menu, I was told that they only had knefe which was 3 days old, mouhalabiya or cheesecake - decided to forego dessert. Apart from the disappointing food, service was also unpleasant. We were there for close to three hours and were only visited by our hostess a couple times to top off our water. Food isn't great, service isn't great, and a $72 bill pre-tip for the above given the subpar quality is ridiculous. Won't be back!"
/user_details?userid=h--BtpfIAwH0ECC7uUQdJA,B A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We just crossed by this restaurant and saw the decoration out of the window. It was very original and attractive so we got in.The place is very nice and the grilled mixed plate is one of the best I tasted in Montreal. The hummus and mtabal eggplant is so delicious. They offered us jus and dessert as well. Simply, I suggest that you try it when you are in downtown. Family friendly and they have a corner yo take photos on a traditional background with a water fountain."

The service was amazing, the cook came out to greet us and offer us some fresh falafel he had just cooked up that were delicious. I ordered the shawarma sandwich and some kebbeh and it was amazing and very Home made. I managed to try the hummus and garlic sauce and they were delish!

/user_details?userid=ABRuCT6K3HJ4e0gWdtOmlA,Ella B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I went to Mirage with a couple of friends who had previously had a positive experience at this restaurant and recommended it to me; sadly this visit was not so good for any of us. The service was terrible, the waitress was very late to come greet us, could not be found (or would pass and not even glance our way) when we wanted to place our order, had an unprofessional attitude, and was not friendly. We asked for water multiple times and we still didn't have a carafe on our table by the time we left. The food took extremely long to be served. The place was also clearly understaffed, there was only one other visible staff member (other than the waitress), and he did not seem to care to help her out or try to take care of us while he was standing on the floor behind a counter, and we kept looking his way and trying to wave for attention. One hour in things was so bad we felt compelled to ask for the manager to address our complaints to him, but the result of this encounter was even more disappointing. As he saw our frustration the manager could have done something to make it up to us, instead he kept justifying his position, and closed the conversation with a ""I'll make sure to take care of you next time"", which is the kind of empty promise better not said. The food might have tasted ok, and the prices not too outrageous (it wasn't cheap either), but the experience was very unpleasant and I would not repeat it or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Middle-Eastern cuisine is not only about the food, it's about a whole experience, hospitality, friendliness, generosity, a shared little dish to start the meal while you have a good time with friends..."
