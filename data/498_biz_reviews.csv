/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Seems to be a really authentic spot! The papusas are cooked great, large portion for $3. I got the queso and the pork + beans, both were very tasty! How are these not more popular?Don't skip on the plantain and sour cream starter!! They give you a WHOLE giant plantain that's been cooked to super sweet and velvety perfection. I love these and they're really hard to find! This is now a super favorite spot just for these.Had the chicken breast plate which came with a large salad and rice + beans. The rice was super good, cooked way better than most places. The chicken had some spices on it but there wasn't anything too special about the plate.They have a lot of authentic drinks too, my favorite is Horchata which was spiced just right. Cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg in there. Perfection!The staff was very very nice too, although a bit slow at the end when waiting for a box. At the register, we striked up a conversation about plantains which was enlightening.I'll definitely be coming back for more papusas and plantains."
/user_details?userid=-6WwCAgaEJNuAaM3pOFVqQ,Crystal L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"I love this place, I stopped by while visiting Montreal. The service was amazing, our server recommended a traditional beverage and we ordered it without asking what it was - he smiled, and very proudly brought us our surprise, amazing horchata.  The papusas were insanely good, I got one with beans, even though I also eat meat, it was SO GOOD. I tried my friend's papusa, he got meat on his and it was also unbeatable. We ordered a lot of food and loved every single dish. They also had some exotic desserts that we wanted to try but we were too full on all of the food we ordered, so that's what I recommend you consider while making your order - leave room for a dessert!"

I had brunch there and got 2 eggs, plantains, beans, half an avocado, cheese, and a chicken tamale. I asked for scrambled eggs and to my surprise they added tomatoes and peppers. Everything tasted great! It's a good change from the regular brunch staples."
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Papusas are bigger than other places which I really appreciate it. The pork and cheese is the best and ask for it extra crispy. Their pickled cabbage is lacking more variety, tastes very vinegary. The service is super inconsistent and make sure you have at least 12 mins to wait for the papusas when you order to go. I'm not a fan of places charging me for sauces and that is exactly what they do. Overall the papusas are decent but definitely nothing to be jumping up for joy."
/user_details?userid=8SmGbIlNujF9VXFQ5cas8A,Seth P.,"Pacifica, CA",5 star rating,I thought I had eaten at every Papuseria in Montreal and today we randomly walked in here because we were in the area and to my amazement we had the BEST papusas and enchiladas of any restaurant in Montreal. A great lucky find.

/user_details?userid=0zOCmWbSyuAUyPKfSd9R_w,Francis D.,"Berlin, Germany",4 star rating,"Came home from a trip to south america and was craving some traditional fare so I tried this place out. It was super busy and i ordered for pickup but it still took about 45mins to get ready. Totally worth the wait... very good quality, big portions, just what i was looking for. Try it out for sure."

/user_details?userid=iFMtSp_4HpnnW8ID5QKVFg,Zoey K.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I go there quite often with my husband who is from El Salvador. Its very hard to find good pupusas in Montreal when you come from El Salvador because most restaurants dont even compare and thats the truth. This restaurant however is quite good and I was able to make my husband somewhat happy since at all the other restaurants he would complain they didnt know how to make them well. Pupusas, soups, carne asada as well as the crispy beef tacos they have are all quite delicious. Food looks clean and so does the kitchen. I didn't like that once I went to pickup my takeout from there and when I arrived a table of clients who spoke English had just arrived and the two waitresses were arguing behind the cash because neither wanted to take them, and they were making fun of them for speaking english which I found very unprofessional and quite offensive....."
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is my new favourite pupusa place in town! I've been to three other pupuserias within walking distance of this place and have decided that El Chalateco is the best. I always order the bean pupusas which have this perfect creamy texture, and the curtido and tomato sauce that come with them are fresh and delicious. The guacamole and chips are also really good and a decent portion size for an appetizer, although if you're vegan or dairy intolerant be sure to ask for it without cheese. (The cheese is sprinkled on top of the guac, but isn't listed on the menu.) The servers are super friendly, the food arrives quickly, and there's enough seating that I've never had to wait for a table even though it's always busy.The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the TVs (they seem to be everywhere you look)."
/user_details?userid=hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,Gregory S.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"Came here with some friends and one of them was El Salvadorian.  I love lots of Latino food and especially tamales so I was looking forward to this place.  Went on an extremely hot day and it just so happens that the restaurant did not have any air conditioning.  It was like a sauna!  There were three portable fans that really didn't do much.Ordered the Sangria, which was strong in alcohol (a lot of wine), but I did not like the taste that much.  I had the chicken tamale to start with.  It was decent, but the middle of my tamale was room temperature.  I like my tamales to be piping hot.Then I had the pupusas and wow let me just say that they were awesome.  Warm, flavorful, tasty and accompanied with coleslaw and hot salsa made me forget about the average tamale I had just consumed.Pupusas are typically a very heavy meal, but I managed to chow down 2 of them.And to top it all off, the food is very inexpensive."

/user_details?userid=xSR2fy8x0IdnZ9s-5Wvt9A,A G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Why wait in line every weekend to go to the popular brunch joint right around the corner when you can go to this place? The scrambled eggs, homemade tortillas, plantains, avocado, beans, feta, sour cream special is a true breakfast of champions in the best kinds of ways, super fresh and cheap to top it all. My main breakfast spot these days."
/user_details?userid=4sxH0vYXE-X11Zd59BnSiQ,Jenn B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've passed this place hundreds of times but it's so unassuming that I never thought to check it out until my husband brought home pupusas one night (oh, pupusas, where have you been all my life?). How glad I am to know it now. First off, the waitress was one of the nicest and most genuine I've come across recently. She actually seemed slightly hurt that I didn't believe her at first when she said my favorite dish was actually really healthy. (I forget the name but it was a corn tamale with cream- imagine a really moist piece of sweet corn bread... Ok that sounds a bit odd but trust me and the nice waitress when we say it's amazing!). My husband got a couple pupusas and they were delicious and filling. Don't let the size fool you! It being my first time there, I panicked and got the Salvadoran tacos because I know tacos and generally love them. While they were good (fried and topped with vegetables) I'd stick to my tamale and the pupusas... Or just keep trying other things the waitress recommends. Totally reasonably priced- 2 adults and a kid ate for under $30 AFTER tax & tip and we were pretty full. It'll take a serious amount of will power to not stop in the next hundred times I pass."
