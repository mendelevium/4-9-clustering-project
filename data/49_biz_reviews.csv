So it only made sense to order some to celebrate the holidays!  We ordered from Bomboloni Boss because they offered delivery options unlike other restaurants selling these pastries, and we were not disappointed!!Their website is beautiful and, since they offer delivery, it was overall a really easy process! In addition, their Bombolonis were deeeelicious!! We tried the cannoli flavor, red velvet flavor, blueberry flavor and salted caramel flavor (not pictured). All of the flavors were so yummy but our favorite was the cannoli flavor (which they've added to their menu)! Overall, we definitely recommend checking out this business! Their flavors are unique, the ordering process is easy and their products are yummmmyy!"

A box of six feels quite weighty--that's because they're heartily overstuffed with creamy filling!  I ordered a box with nutella, pistachio, champagne rosé, and almond. The packaging is a lovely touch that makes them feel premium as they are. I booked for pickup at noon when they open for takeout and the bombolonis were still warm! I agree with my fellow Yelpers...the nutella one is the richest, most decadent flavor. The champagne one is so pretty but I found the taste very delicate so I couldn't make out a flavor in particular. Same with the pistachio...besides the green color, I wouldn't be able to identify the flavor if I didn't get to see it. The almond had a strong almond essence to it. They're all really pretty and presentable--a great gift option! I bought mine as a pre birthday treat and was happy with them. The dough is pretty divine, it's soft and just the right, light texture. The donuts are dusted with icing sugar and granulated sugar. I appreciate how they're not oily. I warmed them up gently in the toaster oven for that warm, melty texture. It's worth the little drive up Decarie to pick up a couple of heavy Bombolonis :)"

If you're craving a donut or a dessert, consider trying a bomboloni! We couldn't decide which to get so we decided to get a few different flavours! We were tempted to get one of each, but we're only two peopleWe ordered the red velvet with mascapone filling, nutella (my fav!!), strawberry heart, coffee crisp, pistachio, and the nutella ricotta. They all very good, decent size for the price. I was actually looking to order a box containing a number of them, but there was only the option to pick individually. Perhaps this can be offered in the future . My only other comment was the coffee crisp one needs abit more concentrated coffee taste in the cream - but I am a strong coffee kind of girl so that's my personal preference. Overall I would recommend!"

My favorite by far is the Nutella & would say it deserves a trophy! Decadent, rich and generously filled with Nutella yet without that heavy feeling. The second time around the donuts were fresh out of the oven and as you can imagine, it was HEAVENLY. Even the car smelled like Bombilinis ;-)A few things to keep in mind, you will need to order these more than 24 hours ahead online so you can't just drop in.  They are located at Table 51 (no signage) and only open between 11 am-3pm.Make sure to share these with others as I don't believe you can just order one or two."

I gave in, and set my date online with a time. I went on my date, picked 6 beautiful looking donuts; there was a personalized message, which was a beautiful touch. When I got home for a night cap, and then had a bite of the donut....it was love at first bite. I wish everyone to go ahead and fall in love with these amazing delicious donuts. Right now, it is perfect timing! Christmas!"
