/user_details?userid=Pc4LV-N3MHSzv3UO_9hY3Q,Mitzi W.,"Alameda, CA",4 star rating,Not bad for mall Chinese food. Expected it to be stir fry but it was soup noodles. And the noodles are hand pulled!  Had the pork noodles and the seafood noodles.  Hit the spot!
/user_details?userid=FsGjL_GNpzhvSCQ3DJiHpA,Ibrahim M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5 star rating,Got the broth with braised beef.  Was skeptical at first since we r in a food court.  Saw the guy grab pasta dough and start making enough pasta for my soup to order.  That was pretty cool to watch.  Bowl was very flavorful and certainly exceeded my expectations.  Great value and flavors in a food court  - can't go wrong if you like Taiwanese noodle soup.
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is in the food court at the Eaton Centre.  After some serious shopping I was hungry, so stopped here for a bowl of noodles.  It was pretty food for a food court place.  I had the #5 Beef Shank Noodle Soup ($8.95).  It was slices of beef shank, bok choy and noodles.  There were green onions and cilantro as well.  The broth was surprisingly good.  It was very flavourful and had a very subtle spicy kick to it.  It was not spicy, I mean I would consider it mild, but it had an ever so tiny and fleeting kick to it.They pull the noodles in front of you when you order and then toss it in hot water.  It's a fun show to watch.  The noodles were nice and chewy.  The bok choy were nicely cooked.  The beef was super tender, but since it was shank some pieces were a bit too fatty for my liking, but there were some lean pieces too.I am not usually a fan of food court food, but I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's a nice change amidst all the usual chains (e.g. Tiki Ming, Kojax, Thai Express, Subway, etc.)."
/user_details?userid=-a0XgJCXoJln2Ue_JMnfIQ,Jules D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Take it from someone who is used to their location in chinatown: it does not compare to the actual restaurant! Really bland in flavour. Meat is not the same and looks suspicious. Broth tastes like instant soup mix rather than beefy, fatty broth. The noodles were the right texture but didn't have enough sauce or seasoning as it does at the restaurant. This is basically the fast-food version of the original beef brisket with dry noodle-the half-assed version.You also get way less food for the same price. I usually can never finish the bowl and today I was very capable. Lackluster!! Will not be returning but I still love NUDO on St-Laurent. This location gives it a bad name :/"
/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"Hit or miss restaurant. 2.5 starsReally depends on what u order. The pork ribs noodle is pretty descentbecause the meat is tender and flavorful.Today i ordered the beef shank,and found it underwhelming, the beef didn't have much flavor to it, they should make a real hao lam meen instead.The soup base is all the same,and taste more on the sweet side rather than meaty flavors. The noodles are descent as well,sometimes undercooked,so u have to soak it in your soup before eating it.A good about the place is they only charge 1 dolla for double the amount of noodles,which is totally worth it  cause or else you won't be full from their regular portions.Conclusion,better than nothin when you are really craving for some soup noodles."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent food court restaurant. I still love chez Lan better.  Haven't been this place since I graduated. They change their servings bowl to a thin plastic one. The portion goes smaller than before. The beef noodle soup also changed from a dark colour to a more clear look, similar to Lan. I used to get a free pop drink with my student ID. Good old memories changed a bit. A little disappointed. Still worth a try."
/user_details?userid=WSS_IdtIg42NvpxF7_jvJw,Jonny T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food and great place right in the food court easy access. I liked they make noodles in front of you. I got the #1 which was noddles with peanut sauce, shredded chicken with peanut sauce and bok Choi. The portion was goood and price also under $10 I added a combo option for $2 for drink and side dish. The side dish tasted disgusting meat at your own risk. The food came out popping hot and was delicious. The peanut sauce tasted a bit bland felt like they watered down the sauce and hot sauce as I saw the texture too watery. The service was quite fast and plenty of seating"
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: Mall fast food. A nice touch is that they hand-pull the noodles in front of you.FOOD: The food was decent. I think that if you want genuine Lamian, go to Lanzhou Lamian in Chinatown. I promise that you won't be disappointed. The flavors at this Nudo seemed on the bland side (I had to add more spices to bring up the flavor) and the quantity of noodles was small. Even my friends pointed out the tiny portion. I will not be coming back here again, especially since there are so many other options in the food court.PRICE: I was pretty disappointed with their portion-to-price ratio. The plastic bowl was quite small and it didn't fill me up as much as it should have. It wasn't too expensive but I would rather spend the money elsewhere.SERVICE: It's a food court so there wasn't any service to be delivered. They are efficient though."
/user_details?userid=kjzg7jTm6tWhETeJ3xDqZw,Andrew H.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"These soups! Are just awesome! Full of flavours, heat, healthiness and much more. It's fun to watch them beat the noodle dough in front of you, it shows you're getting it freshly made. The prices are also competitive. The only thing is that they only accept cash and debit, no credit but don't let that stop you from going. It's a must try."
/user_details?userid=zc96Xp6H2pa-NY0F6bulcQ,Irv K.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Needed a quick brunch and it came to me in the bottom level of the Centre Eaton in Montreal. What a treat to get hand pulled noodles in a nice air conditioned space with free WiFi. I needed a place to escape the heat and humidity and this worked....now to go find a cold beverage. Note to Self: ""balancing your carry-on luggage and a big bowl of soup is tough normally. Good job not burning yourself or others with a broken clavicle on top of everything"". Why thank you Self!"
/user_details?userid=pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w,Bernie C.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is cool!  I've never seen anything like this in a food court.  It's such a great show watching the chef pull the noodles right in front of you. It's like watching a true pizza chef flipping the pizza.  They only serve noodles here - hence the name.  So please don't ask them to substitute it for anything. :-). It's located on the 1st floor of the Eaton Centre.  I had the BBQ beef shank noodle soup for $8.95.  The noodles were pretty good and there was ample beef shank.  Sometimes this is a problem with food court food in that give plenty of carbs and very little meat.  It's kind of the exact opposite here.  I kind of wanted more noodles, but I can't really complain since I got a show out of it and were made right in front of my eyes, literally!  What I liked was that they put the soup in a separate bowl so that you could appreciate the noodles before pouring the broth on it, however I would have preferred if the broth was a bit hotter.  It was warm but I like my food piping hot.  Despite the broth not being to my liking temperature wise, when you combined it with the hand-pulled noodles, it made for an awesome light snack.Verdict: Come see a quick show and a good light snack.  To ponder: I hope they have more than one noodle puller during busy hours because it did take around 7-8 minutes for my meal to be prepared and that could end up in a huge line during the lunch rush."
/user_details?userid=G7Gq1wK_En5Yb6Crl-F0Dw,Julia V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't feel like I'm eating food court food when I eat here and that's a good thing. It tastes super fresh and yummy and they serve it to you in a real bowl which is a nice touch. Usually when I order Asian food, especially noodle soups, at a food court it ends up tasting very fast foody. Here, it feels like ordering a bowl of noodles at a chinese restaurant but eating in a mall environment. I think that's helped by the fact that it's part of a local chain of restos.The sesame chicken bowl is good but my fave is the beef shank. I've dranken the entire bowl of broth and was fine, I don't think they put too much msg in it. I've tried all three locations and I'd say this one is on par with the one close to Concordia (the china town one is horrible). The one close to Concordia gives you a bigger portion of noodles but has more msg so in the end it's on par."

/user_details?userid=GRz2VNgbImKxtBDg5ssb_Q,Kelan W.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Very good and hearthy bowls of noodles in the food court of Eaton Center. However, it used to be better. The soup broth used to be richer and now it's watery a few times when I was there. The portion of noodles in the bowl seems to have decreased as well and now paying 10$ for a bowl isn't really enough for lunch as. I noticed these points for a few months already and I am disappointed by the portion everytime as there are more joints of LaMian (Chinese Ramen) near Guy-Concordia or Chinatown with greater portions for the same price.3 stars since the food is still delicious and probably the best in the food court."

This is also one of the first time I have to say I love Food Court ""Fast' food! Spicy Beef Shank Noodle ($8.50) was really good but a little pricey and smaller in portion compares to Chinatown location. A good option if you are in the area and have cravings for Chinese food."
/user_details?userid=LsNK47ZPj-0Re_WhTmZjrQ,Arlene A.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Walking through underground Montreal, we passed this place and saw the young gentleman working there making the noodles from scratch. Fascinated, I bought a #8 BBQ Pork with Noodle soup. I was not disappointed. The broth was tasty and rich, the noodles were firm and fresh and the pork was delicious, with a genuine bbq roasted pork flavor. I'm sure that the Québécois who live here might not think much of this place, with so many great food options in this wonderful city, but for someone like me in the middle of the food desert that is central NJ, it was quite a treat to find such a quality bowl of noodles, just casually walking by in an underground mall. Truly enjoyed and highly recommend!"

The noodles are freshly made, you actually see them do in in front of your eyes and trust me its a dinner and a show event. I love the fact that you can always ask to add Sesame sauce (really upgrade the meal) the soup on the side (so you can add as much as you want and not drawn the food) and its very reasonably priced ( 7-9$ per meal) for this kind of fresh food. Also if you are a student you get free drink."

However, here is not China, I don't have so many choices. I have lunch here very often since the noodle here is better than that in other Chinese restaurants. I recommend the #2, that is my favorite one, noodle with pork sauce. That one is delicious that I can't find anything to substitute it.They made the noodle in front of their costumers. Many Lanzhou-noodle restaurants doing it in China so I feel it is very common. However here is a non-Chinese guy makes noodle here, which makes me feel very interesting:)).I recommend here totally."
/user_details?userid=5Yc0NgkRKmwgeVbilJ0w7w,Pet A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I really like this place and have been coming for years.The food itself is OK.  I won't say its the best Chinese food, but it's definitely not the worst.  To all the people complaining here, I'd like to remind you that you are in a food court.  With that in mind, it is probably the best Chinese food court food I have ever had.  The food is quite flavorful, and the portion size is good for what you are paying (8-10 dollars a bowl).The broth is not bad.  It has a bit of a kick to it and pairs well with the noodles.The star here though are the noodles.  They are hand pulled in front of you and then put to boil in the water for a minute or two to firm up.  When you bite into them, they have a nice chew to them.  I tend to order the noodles with pork sauce.  The pork is nicely seasoned and very chunky and sprinkled with some fresh cilantro. There are nice undertones of garlic and Chinese spices in the pork sauce.  You can think of it as a ""Chinese spaghetti bolognese"".  Since it is served as a dry noodle (no broth in the bowl), they give you a small bowl of broth on the side.  I pour a bit of the broth over the noodles to loosen them up, this making it easier to eat with the chop sticks.  This is my favorite bowl to order.I've also tried the other dishes and they have all been consistently good.I would definitely recommend this place if you're craving unique noodles downtown, and some good Chinese flavors."

After a long day of shopping, I decided to give it a try. Normally food court food will be frozen and heated up or fast food that is filled with calories. Not with Nu-do. Each dish uses hand made noodles that is made fresh to order. During my visit, I ordered the noodle soup with chicken and my brother ordered the noodle soup with beef. The noodle soup with chicken tasted amazing. The noodles had a nice texture and were cooked amazingly. The broth also tasted delicious as it was filled with flavour. My brother said that the noodle soup with beef tasted awesome and the noodles were the best part of the dish. Nu-do exceeded my expectations. The fresh noodles and tasty broth is not something found in a food court. I recommend this to everyone looking for food to eat after shopping. It earned all of its five stars."

For $12 we bought #4 to share with extra veggies, a considerably smaller, less tasty and less-well cooked version of the beef tendon soup at Nouilles. Nudo noodles are hand-pulled but with considerably less craftsmanship and style than Nouilles, they're not as tasty and seemed a little under-cooked. Beef was cooked but not to the melting tenderness of Nouilles. Save your appetite for the real deal!"
/user_details?userid=-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,Billy K.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"This is a unique food court option - nothing similar in terms of freshness & entertainment. It's located in the Montreal Eaton centre on the bottom floor. The chef spins, stretches and slaps the dough on the counter. He then separates the dough into fresh noodle goodness. It certainly attracts a crowd!You select from about 8 different options including, pork, beef chicken and vegetable. Portions are a decent size and priced between $7 - $9 per bowl.This is probably the first time I tried freshly made Udon noodles and it really makes a difference. These are damn good noodles.I ordered the vegetarian soup and it was served with Bok Choi, mushrooms and lot's of green onion. I thought the broth was slightly oily but still good overall. I will be back the next time I'm in Montreal to try some of the other options.PS - If you sit near the restaurant, it gets very LOUD. The dough is slammed against the counter over and over again, it actually scared me a few times.BK"
/user_details?userid=iAS1fd-iKqya1xshoCC5Eg,Sarah S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"First I thought this was the same place as Nudo in Chinatown, which is my favourite place to get noodles. But they taste completely different. The soup is too spicy and tasteless; the quality of meat is not as good. No marinated vegetables, but only a couple pieces of bokchoy in the soup. The only notable thing about this restaurant is that they make noodles right in front of your nose."
/user_details?userid=oTxQtsOERwwgnA3R63SIHQ,Richard S.,"Melbourne, FL",4 star rating,Is this the best Ramen in Montreal?  No.  Not even close.  Kinton Ramen blows this place away.  Is this great ramen for a food court?  Why YES it is.  Order the #1.  There is a reason they put the Chicken Ramen first on their menu. The Chicken Ramen with the crushed peanuts just gives the ramen broth more flavor than the other options that just add cooked meat to the broth and noodles.   The side dish bundled in the combo was lacking.  This place should either increase the number and quality of their side dishes or get rid of side dishes alltogether.

You the spin then slap the counter with the noodles, and then they pull, bend, pull again, bend again, and pull again. Sure it's in the food court of Eaton Center in Montreal...However it's fresh pasta and whatever culture you look at, fresh pasta/noodles just freaking rock.There are only about 8 menu options. Noodles, with some meat (Pork, Chicken or Beef) with delicious baby Bok Choi, broth and of course the noodles.For a food court restaurant which permits the owner to print money without putting a good product, I can't find anything wrong with this delicious fresh noodle bowl.

/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When I'm feeling a little under the weather, my mind immediate shifts to soup.  Warm, slurpy delicious soup.  And when I'm stuck  downtown at work, I need warm delicious slurpy soup that's quick and nearby.  And Nu-Do fits the bill.  Located in the food court at the Eaton Center, it isn't the first place I'd think to get my soup fix, but it works.  They do takeout, putting the noodles and toppings in one container and the soup in another, so you don't need to sit in the food court to enjoy (though it can be fun to people watch). A bowl of bbq pork noodle soup will cost you less than $10, so it doesn't break the bank either. It isn't particularly spicy, yet it's flavorful, so when I need to get the sinuses moving I make sure to load up on the hot sauce to add in.  As an added bonus, while waiting for your soup you get to be entertained by the cook pulling the noodles.  It can get loud, as the dough is repeatedly banged on the counter, but oh so worth it."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: In the Eaton Center food court. Food: Obviously I ordered noodles since that's the only option on their menu. I chose the chicken with sesame sauce, but the non-soup version. The noodle puller, as I like to call him, emerged from the kitchen ready for some serious action. After giving me a rather serious 'don't mess with me' look, he proceed to yank the sh*t out of the noodles, then slammed the hell out of them. Repeatedly. It's a rather noisy and somewhat aggressive process and I can only hope that the noodle-puller achieved satisfaction from the physical exertion of the task. The non-soup was served in a to-go bowl, with the noodles on the bottom, shredded chicken and baby Bok Choy on the top, and of course, the sesame sauce. The first thing I tried was the chicken - it was all breast, just the way I like it, with not a hint of pink anywhere to be found. Though a little salty, I really enjoyed the chicken. It was tender and seemed fresh. I had to forgo the Bok Choy because no amount of cutting (or attempts at) seemed to work. I just couldn't chop through the damn leaves. They were so pretty and green, too. Anyway, I then got a taste of the noodles in sesame sauce. The sauce was  quite nice but tasted more like the peanut sauce you would find with peanut butter dumplings. The noodles were good though I did find them to be a bit on the starchy side. Also, they really should cut these things in half so I can get them on my fork more easily. The overall dish was very good, though I will hold that 4th star for a retry - this time in soup format, as the noodles are meant to be eaten.Service: This is where I docked a star. The chick at the counter wasn't friendly at all and I felt like I was bothering her. Never mind that it was 2pm and there was no one else there. The noodle puller wasn't friendly either. It was one of those places that made me want to get my noodles and get the hell out of there, perhaps to a sunnier side of the food court.Price: Under $10, and the noodles are pretty filling."

Generous portions for a reasonable price, and you can add extra meat/noodles for a few extra dollars. The broth is really tasty, and the ingredients complement each other really well.

That's what amazes me. You can see the chefs hand-pulling the dough to make the noodles as you wait in line. I got the #5 beef shank noodle soup. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the soup base could have been better. It didn't really have much depth of flavour, but for about $10 after tax in a mall food court, this is amazing.
