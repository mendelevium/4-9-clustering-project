/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"Plan on eating your meal here like a hungry starving raccoon. We came for a family casino night dinner and I was mildly impressed on seafood night for the quality of the food. Selection is vast. Lineups are long for the warm food. However they do a fairly admirable job in ensuring chafing dishes are wiped down and the place doesn't look like Golden Corral on a busy night. Be quite patient though. Also avoid peak times IE 6-7pm unless you enjoy waiting in long lines. We are very early. I believe it was just before 5:00 pm.  I must have eaten a half ton of tempura shrimp. They were delicious. The salmon and shrimp served were also delicious. I did try the roast beef as well. It was Impressive. There is a good salad bar but everyone comes for the main event. The warm food line. Selection is vast. Asian, pizza, beef chicken fish. It should all be available. See if you can eat 3-4 plates and unbuckle that belt buckle a few notches. The dessert selection is very solid with lots of different options. Too much food. It's very good but a belly buster! Enjoy!"

This restaurant has the option to eat a la carte or buffet, and we wanted to pig out, so we chose the buffet.The ambiance here so romantic. Nice, dimly-lit, and not too loud. We were seated next to the kitchen, and it was pretty cool because we could watch the chefs cook behind a glass. Service here is also great, our waiter was super polite and attentive.Regarding the food, everything was just OK. They didn't have too much of a selection (maybe I'm so used to Las Vegas Buffets). They had the soup/salad bar, small area for seafood & poultry, and tiny dessert bar. Overall, hubby & I really only liked their dessert."
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"For two years in a row now I've had a birthday dinner here and I must say last years visit was better then this years. I made a point of coming back here because I dreamt of all you can eat crab legs and I was disappointed to see they weren't here this time.Started with an amazing Moscow mule and the ginger beer was spot on ! There's a great choice of cold deli meats and cheese to start with or add in to a salad. There's a carving station with different meats and sauces to accompany them. The theme this time around was definitely geared towards the Asian route, there were egg rolls duck a lorange and other oriental items. A fair choice of options but I've seen more exciting buffet spreads.The dessert section was quite nice with lots of fruits and cakes, even a chocolate fountain to dunk your fruits in. I suggest the almond cake it was honestly my favourite. Overall a decent spot to get food within the casino but check ahead of time check what the menu looks like so that you know what your getting yourself into"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located within the Casino. Pretty looking casino-buffet with solid food options for gamblers who need a break. You can order ""a la carte"" for some fancy menu options or just hit the buffet and stuff your mouth with the goods.My visit was due to a work activity and I stuck around with the ""a la carte"" menu. Escargot as an app (delish!), swordfish as a main (so moist!) and some kind of chocolate mousse (that didn't suck for a change!). Overall a very impressive meal. Swordfish could have used a kind of side-sauce or dip. It was so moist and tender but the flavor was a little weak. I would have really enjoyed even a small sauce of the side. I did sneak in a few bites from the buffet table my coworkers went with. Their general tao was really good! Overall, everyone was very satisfied with what they ate and the service was top notch."
/user_details?userid=tejGH-sqC2iRz2ZQTZgsqw,Ed A.,"Weehawken, NJ",4 star rating,"It's a casino buffet at the largest (?) casino in Canada.  As you might expect, it draws quite the crowd.  Make sure to let the staff member on line know if you're willing to slum it out at the bar - you can get seated much quicker that way (cut my waiting time in half I'd estimate).Good variety of food - had everything from shrimp cocktail with sauce, bbq ribs, prime rib, mac n cheese, and some tasty pastries and cakes for dessert. There's lots of other stuff I didn't have the stomach capacity for, including oysters, chicken, sliders, pasta, etc.  Something for everyone, like a good buffet should have.Price was about $31 CAD for 1 - the price varies depending on the day of the week and time."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,"Went there for lunch Saturday and disappointed with the tiny selection offered!$19/person for lunch which I thought was reasonable before going there. Once arrived, noticed that the selection of food for lunch is extremely small. You have a crappy salad bar, choice of only 2 meats (ham and chicken), some mussels, fried fish bites, 1 pasta dish, pizza, and some fries and vegetables.The taste of the food is edible that's all I can say. I frankly never went to a buffet to eat so little food. I barely ate at all. The only thing that made more sense was the selection of desserts...I can because they can use the leftover for dinner service.For that price, you are better off going to any other buffet in town for lunch.Service and decor are decent."
/user_details?userid=vdcmz1aor0TuO8p9H9SGmA,Jason L.,"Candiac, Canada",1 star rating,Had been here last year and enjoyed the food but this time i went with a friend and was beyond dissatisfied.  It seems they might have been getting rid of old food or simply had run out of fresh ingredients.  Everything was over cooked and lacked any flavour.  With sich basic options as overcooked chicken nuggets and bland pizza or the thickest salad dressings you've ever attempted to apply to your salad.. an abhorrent lack of variety to say the least.  Truly a disappointing and over priced night..

I got there at 7;05,and they already ran out of numbers for seatings. The hostess was very nice and told us that we could come back at 8:45 and that it would be first come first serve. we were finally seated at 8:56.Food was very dissapointing. The quality was okay,just passable and a bit better than your tyoical buffet.There was very little choices in the hot area:Beef,chicken potatoes,A couple of shrimp items,smoked salmon,mussels,1 type of plain pasta,rice,onion ring,few salads and cold cuts.That's it. I think that's the smallest amount of choices in a buffet i have ever seen.The desserts were descent .If it wasn't for the 2 for 1,i would be super pissed. I cannot recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I go today dinner at Casino for the deal 2 for 1: 2 persons for 31$. The price is reasonable for the food, can't expect more for a buffet meal at this price. If it was 31$/per person , it gonna be overpriced. Nothing really impressed me as advertising. Not many choice as buffet restaurant, food quality is so so like food served in school cafeteria. U go there more for the ambiance and for the service since the money you paid is more for these than for the food."
/user_details?userid=CrO1A3QpX4MwscwfgUSHhA,Crystal T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"From my experience Quebec has the best casino in Canada, so I'm writing this based on my experience from two years ago when i went to Montreal with my friends, i thought we might as well go visit casino. We gambled till we felt hungry, most of the restaurants are quite expensive and the buffet has the shortest line. I'm not a big fan of buffet because my expectation in food is higher than average, I would choose quality over quantity.One of the best buffet I've been in Canada. We got in and then walked around, the selection is amazingly good with lobsters, smoked salmon and other seafood.. So far nothing had disappointed us. One thing that blew my mind out, it was the Bûche de Noël / Yule log that they served.The best dessert in the house, I believed they only serve this seasonal during Christmas! I cannot recall what the top part was but the middle was icecream and the bottom was crispy, the combination creates an interesting texture as well as a taste of heaven for dessert lover! The decoration of the cream with a blueberry gives an extra taste of Christmas."

As for the food, they have the meat bar, salad bar, other food and my fave of them all: the dessert bar. My fave time to come is on sunday for their brunch. Not only do they have the usual food but they also open the counter for brunch stuff such as omelettes, crepes, etc. Make sure you go there with an empty stomach!"

Friends have been raving about the lobster and duck, but unfortunately when I went, they've informed me that they discontinued the lobster! They have yet to update that on their website too.Overall, the food was mediocre but definitely not to die for. The sauces that we can pour onto our foods have more quality to them than the dish itself.I would not recommend it unless you want to pay $30-40 on desserts. The desserts are fantastic! Probably the highlight of the night. All beautifully presented and so many options! I loved the creme brulee and the sugar pie the most.The servers were attentive and very professional. However I can't help but notice favoritism in the hostess. If you don't look like the targeted crowd (rich, old, and white), you're going to get hidden tables and away from the entrance. It's quite sad, really. All customers should be treated the same regardless of their appearance."
/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here on Friday, after searching for a good buffet in the Montreal area. Surprisingly, I would describe Pavillion 67 as quality over quantity. The food and atmosphere is comparable to fine establishements. As with most new things, this modern and glitzy restaurant looks great. There are some big windows, fancy decorations, chandeliers, candles and the overall layout lends to an an appealing and unique look.For 36$ on the weekend, you will have a gourmet feast of duck, lamb, steak, salmon, lobster claws, crab legs and shrimp which are worth the price. If you come on Wed, Thursday and Sunday, it's 26$ a person, but there are less choices.The selection of food isn't huge, that's the main reason I'm not rating it five stars. On busy nights, the food stations also get cramped, it's not a very wide space. Plus, beverages are not included, which is is kind of silly since you can get free juice, coffee and soda throughout the casino. I recommend carrying your own drink to the restaurant.My highlights were the lobster, the salad bar with assortement of cheese, and for dessert - the chocolate fountain, perfect for dipping fresh strawberries. They also have a station for flambeed bananas made to order.This is a great buffet if you're looking for an upscale style restaurant, free of children and unruly crowds- I would come to the casino just for the food!Note- They have a rotating menu, so call them on the day of to find out what's available."

(some asian food choices here and there) the dumpling soup was mediocre, the ""crispy noodles"" were seasoned with bbq sauce? etc. unfortunately, i don't think the buffet is what is used to be. so save your money"
/user_details?userid=Ya890z2Nk_uUR0XXXrw6sw,Stephy L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"The dining experiences that I have with my hubby is horrible. We were not from Montreal. We went for a visit, and decided to went for a good place to spend our holiday night. We came across this restaurant via yelp, and we also went to their official website which shows good atmosphere to dine in. We went to the restaurant that night, and 20 minutes after we have been seated, nobody come to our table and ask for what drink we want. So, we asked one of the male sever to bring us two hot water. And that sever never come back. We have our first water 35 minutes after seated, and it is cold water instead of hot. What's worse, the food section was extremely limited, and the compare with other buffet that we have before, this restaurant is completely over-priced. The actual atmosphere is not as good as we expected. It also seems like there are not arrangement on which sever take care of which table, the sever rarely come over the table to collect the empty plate or add water. Anyways, this is completely disappointed dining experiences so far I have in Canada, and would never come back and recommend this restaurant to any of my friend or relatives. This restaurant ruined my holiday mood completely by ignoring their customers and the poor services."
/user_details?userid=hRdl9qivZonhHrI7umhifQ,Hennie Rose D.,"Queens, NY",1 star rating,What a disappointment. My boyfriend and I came here during our short trip in Montreal. The reviews made us believe that this was some high end buffet. The aroma was nice but their food was horrible. We went during lunch and the choices were more than limited. There literally 3 entrees to choose from and fries or onion rings. Totally not worth the price we paid. My cousin who lives in Montreal did warn us that it wasn't good. It was a terrible way to leave Montreal with not the best tasting food.

/user_details?userid=RRJBBsdINOnAeplLOg6OVA,Kevin N.,"Torrance, CA",4 star rating,"Nice buffet. Great ambiance, definitely a quality over quantity type of buffet.I tried everything and it was all great. ""I tried everything,"" that's something people rarely ever say at a buffet.I guess that's a good way to sum up the amount of food offered. Dessert area, random station of egg rolls, meat pies, meat balls, pasta, mussels, salmon (THE BEST). Prime rib/chicken section with a selection of gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies. Shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, salad bar, soup bar.That's it and yes I named it all.Very small, but all high quality. Went for several servings of the salmon and mussels. Shrimp cocktail and smoked salmon had me coming back for more too.Creme brulee, chocolate fountain and small cakes are a must get!For $25 for dinner, I guess it's not bad. But I learned fountain drinks weren't included in that price. Bummer.I really didn't check any other options in the casino because casino=buffet in my head instantly."

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"OK, I don't do casinos or buffets. It's just not my scene and one of the reasons why I have zero interest in going to Las Vegas. But a friend of mine told me that there was an all-you-can-eat lobster buffet here on Fridays and Saturdays. After reading the reviews here, I decided to go along.Sitting on the 5th floor of the casino, it's actually a classier looking place than I expected for a buffet restaurant.The buffet isn't one of those with 2000 items but there is an emphasis on higher quality meats and seafood, salads and cheeses. There's roast beef, roast lamb (with mint jelly!) all carved in front of you. There's shrimp galore, mussels, snow crab legs  and half lobsters, claws, tails, tamale and roe included. Great and fresh salad bar, cheeses, baked potatoes, and all the fixings. Desserts are great too, a chocolate fountain, fresh strawberries, pineapple, profiteroles, Paris-Brest, chocolate mousse, cakes, there's more than enough options here for anyone.Food-wise, I found the lobster a bit dry but the roast beef au jus here is fantastic. Everything else was fine, nothing memorable but alright.Service is pretty good too. They clear your tables regularly and they're pretty friendly.I don't see myself coming here regularly since it's a bit out of the way, but once in a while, it's a good place to know of."

If it shows not available on the website, try to contact the restaurant and they might still have few table left. Otherwise there's gonna be a long queue during meal time. Personally, I feel the price for the weekends is a bit to high.The seafood was fresh and the sauce was awesome. But the crabs were too soft to break by the tools. Most of the desserts were too sweet and don't try the pudding if you don't like the taste of rare eggs.Highly recommend the seafood chowder!"

Well let me rephrase that, my boyfriend is allergic to seafood so choosing this place for dinner was not the best idea.  On the bright side we had the option of buffet and a la carte. The food was very good, the seafood options were delish!  I would definitely recommend this place simply because you can choose what you want, and they are actually using quality products. Don't get me wrong I would be definitely make this buffet on top of my list, but i have to be honest and say there are not many endless choices. Normally went I think about going to buffet I think about many choices, and options. Living in America spoiled me !!!  This one however is quite small. Also you must reserve if i recall. I have yet to try the brunch option. We were 4 people and the bill came up to about 130$.  Go try it !v"

My dad had been there maybe a year and a half prior and told me what to expect. I was expecting lobster and creme brûlée! When we got there he said the food options were fewer than be remembered. Unfortunately there was no lobster, and no creme brûlée! But the food was still delicious. The roast beef and gravy was AMAZING as well as the potatoes :) only thing is, if you like your crab legs sweet (as they naturally are) you won't be a fan of these. They seemed to of been brined too long and were pretty salty. Could only eat a few. Their dessert choices could be a little better (I'm a self proclaimed dessert aficionado)Overall it was good! Ultimately it is a 3.5 start buffet. With some minor changes could be a 4 star."

This modern upscale casino buffet features half lobsters, carved meats, oven pizza, a salad bar with assortments of cheese, soups and a dessert bar featuring a chocolate fountain. The seafood was so-so and the selections of food were limited. Surprisingly the seafood was not as fresh as I expected. Lobsters were definitely overcooked and rubbery. I do have to admit the dessert bar was the highlight of the night. At the end, our server offered us tea with cream. Only thing is, I was kind of disappointed with the quality especially for such a fancy looking restaurant. Other than that the restaurant was free of children and the wait time was exactly as it was listed on our slip. Clean place with polite and classy service."

Noise level was average, not too crazy. Service was nice, and considerate. There wasn't much of a food selection. The best was the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail sauce, roast beef, the grilled salmon (only of they are pulled right off the grill hot), creamy seafood soup and definitely the desserts. Some things were too fresh looking from the salad bar. The desserts are the spot light for me. A good quantity of cakes and there's a chocolate fountain. My favorite ones are the coffee custard, amaretti cookies, and raspberry cheesecake. Overall, not really worth the price for the selection and quality of the food. You can really get desserts some place else that is less for the same or better quality."

The whole place is very class and clean. We were assisted and seated immediately. I've been to numerous buffet throughout the US and currently living in Las Vegas to where buffet restaurants are in casinos as well so my expectations coming in to  pavilion was low. We first checked out the food at the buffet before settling down to sit and we noticed that there are few selections compared to other buffets. When we tried out the food we were stunned because it was very tasteful and the salads were unique and delicious. I loved the salad bar and ate mostly salads and desert.

That's just the cold section.The hot section is where it shines. They have roast beef where u decide the thickness you want cut, half lobster and claws on Fridays and Saturdays. They also have duck and my personal favourite grilled salmon on a bed of Asian noodles, wow! They also have Italian dishes like sausage, pizza, pasta'sNow the deserts! They have panacotta , chocolate mousse, pies, cakes, pastries. Honestly i was blown away! Oh and a chocolate fountain! The price is 30+ for each person, and on Sunday's they have brunch!

/user_details?userid=1hJQYk3NiajdYK58TQi9EQ,Anita H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went there once for Sunday brunch and the second time for Saturday brunch. I must say that for a buffet, the food is very good for the price and variety. The Sunday brunch costs more but there's more variety with the breakfast/pastries option. The breakfast station isn't available Mon-Sat. What I really liked was the crêpe station and there's a ton of options to what you prefer for the filling - sweet or savory. I made some sweet ones with berry coulis layered with fresh fruits and cream, the savory was smoked salmon complete with capers, red onions and cream cheese. The view is great and staff are courteous, however the service is much slower on Sundays. It's a trade-off between lower priced, faster service, fewer options on weekdays/Sat or higher priced, slower service, more food options and live music! Mimosas are NOT free for Sunday brunch but all other drinks are (coffee, tea, orange juice, etc). The desserts station is very good with the concept bite sized treats, just enough to taste and enjoy but not too much that you're overloaded or need to waste it. It's a place I'd go with friends or even a more intimate dining experience (it's a bit much for family dinners with kids unless everyone is a bit older). Crowd is definitely older but it's a treat to dress up a bit better for Sunday brunch!"

I saw the 4.5 star rating in a city like Montreal (the French really do know their food) and I knew I was in for a treat.This buffet is spectacular. The plates are huge, so you don't have to keep going back for more every few minutes. Everything is delicious - I filled up on smoked salmon, osso buco, and pan-fried calf's liver. I try to get maximum value at buffets, but even I couldn't resist their delectable mashed potatoes (a ""low value"" item). I must have eaten a kilo or two of those potatoes.Everything else was stellar, as well. The chicken, the mussels, the beef, the shrimp, the desserts - all were at least 4/5 stars.I would have appreciated a comp after playing all day (apparently, they don't comp for poker), but Pavillon 67's prices are dirt cheap, so whatever. This was a $50-$60 buffet for only $30.Next time I'm in Montreal I plan to eat at this buffet every day. It's the only buffet I've been to with quality that rivals high-end restaurants."
