/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Happened to get a chance to eat here for the first day they had reopened the dining room. I was looking for a breakfast spot that didn't need a resy ahead of time and while looking for parking I stumbled on here and saw there was no line up and headed in. The restaurant is small but had taken all safety measures to ensure proper social distancing was respected. The menu was simple but had a twist to it with everything. We were also informed by the waitress that everything was made fresh in house so you know this had to be good. I chose a smoked salmon plate and this thing was delicious the eggs were poached perfectly the salmon was delicious the potatoes were to die for and a cool twist on a side salad that I loved was the addition of mango on top. My girl got the mixed plate that had a bit of everything ( eggs meat beans creaton toast and potatoes) and I definitely stole a couple bites of that sour dough toast.If your looking for a breakfast spot on the plateau hit up this gem  friendly staff and delicious meals will keep you coming back

Wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Can get busy on the weekend so arrive before the lunch rush! Street parking available.My husband and I visited this place for the first time on our mini Montreal trip. I ordered a latte and my husband had their regular coffee. I ordered one of their eggs Benedict and my husband ordered one of their breakfast platters. Both were yummy and delicious, hitting just the spot in our tummies. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating to our needs. It was a cute place and if definitely go back next time we're in town!"

I took ""Le Gros Glouton"" which had pretty much everything (see attached pictures). I really liked the salad that came with the food. The bacon was abit over cooked for me. The crepes, baguettes, potatoes were good. As for the second plate, ""saumon chick"", the salmon was pretty decent.PS: If you like hot sauce, you should definitely taste the one that is on the table. It is"
/user_details?userid=qZlNNWCypJI2FOu0_0-OTQ,John M.,"Calgary, Canada",1 star rating,"I'm really unhappy with what happened at this resto. I got a very good table by the sunny window and ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach, mushroom, and asparagus, and an extra English muffin which I always get with eggs Benedict to soak up all that lovely hollandaise and egg yolk. The waiter was, judging by her accent, French (as in from France) and spoke not a word of English and my French is execrable (but better than her English, I promise), so I was a bit anxious about whether the order would be correct, but it was, with the split muffin in a little ramekin on the side, and the plate looked absolutely beautiful- I'd post a pic but you see many examples of their Benedicts on this site already. So I proceed to eat, and start with the salad, which was...fine. Not special per se but not offensive either. I move on to the star, that gorgeous eggs Benedict. Yolk is PERFECT. Just a perfectly, perfectly poached egg, so I tear off a bit of my extra English muffin, and hmmm- it's not buttered, but is toasted, and wow it's DENSE, nothing like the light, airy, crispy, BUTTERED thing one expects with an English muffin. Then I take this dense, unbuttered...thing and dip it into my egg yolk and hollandaise slurry, and hmmm again: the hollandaise has no, zero, lemon. Lemon is a NECESSARY aspect of a hollandaise, and my big issue with most resto versions of this French bit of heaven is that they never seem to put enough lemon juice into it. Well, this one had NONE. But the potatoes were so-so and I was hungry so I proceeded to eat the rest of my plate, which had evolved in only a few moments from ""oh-my-God this looks delicious"" to ""this is worse than 'eggs Benedict' you get from iHOP.""  But the worst part was that this Benedict had NO ASPARAGUS. None. I signal the waiter and try to say that ""there is no asparagus here"" and with the assistance of google translate, get my point across, so she ascertains that the asparagus was ""of poor quality"" and so the chef elected to cut it into small pieces. Okay, it the asparagus was bad, why was I not informed of this when I ordered it, and second-- there was no asparagus in this dish. Asparagus was the most expensive and most precious thing on the plate and would  have married beautifully with a COMPETENT hollandaise, but there was none. I finished up and went to pay, and here's another galling aspect: That English muffin was $3 extra and I was not comped one cent for receiving a dish that lacked the star ingredient. Not a penny. So here we are. I still tipped 18% but am very unhappy."

I rarely eat a crepe that good and my friend was also really impress with her choice. The owner of the place came to see us asking if everything was perfect, she was really nice. I completely recommand this place."

The food was delicious, the wait was short, the servers were friendly, and best of all it wasn't too pricey. And they used paper straws which I really liked. I recommend the Béné Doré!"
