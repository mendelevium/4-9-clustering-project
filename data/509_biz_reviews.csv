/user_details?userid=hGJhZ6Z-sG5ux9yzZc406g,Juna S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not sponsored and didn't receive money for this review.Food: fish for sushis and sashimis was very fresh. Warm dishes like garlic shrimp, cheese grilled mussels and tempuras were really good, well beyond all you can eat average. They also offer Japanese specialty snacks, like takoyaki, teriyaki chicken skewer, etc.Tempura shrimp was my fav, fresh shrimp coated with batter and fried to golden yellow, warm and crispy but not greasy, yumm!For dessert they had more than ice cream. Fried bananas topped with whipped cream and candy. It was creative and absolutely delicious. Red wine pickled pears were definitely a good compliment to the meat.We ordered cocktails too, it was ok, but it's not a cocktail bar rightMoreover, the ambiance was warm and cozy, very suitable for friends get togethers. The food service was quick and all waiters were responsive.Highly recommend this place and will definitely go back!"

Like a lot of people said the dry ice is such a cool presentation. The service was friendly and fast. No complaints there. The inside is very cute/hispter. Don't get fooled by the outside.As for the food, it was amazing. Pretty much the same as Kanda and K2. Very good diversity of both sushi and food.  Ordering from the ipad is really convenient. Lets you see pictures of every item. I would definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=lhrleFTsOw91vEUY1s871A,Morgan H.,"Fairfax, VA",3 star rating,"I was craving sushi and Japanese food while in Montreal and decided to order from Taiyo. I had the tuna poke bowl which had cucumber, japanese pancake and avocado over a bed of sushi rice. The bowl also had a sweet, mayo-based sauce also coated the rice. The tuna, cucumber and avocado were very fresh and high quality. I did not care for the sauce and wish they had the option to remove or substitute this mayo based sauce for the more traditional soy-based ponzu. It was very overpowering and sweet; I was glad it did not cover the the fish and vegetables. The rice was soft and well cooked but unfortunately overpowered by the creamy dressing.Overall, the fish and vegetables in the bowl were tasty, high quality but the sauce was not very good. I think the price was on the higher side for poke bowls as well. I would try some of their other sushi though for the quality fish and cuts."
/user_details?userid=_mNXmNRZt2hfZANcTj2w0Q,Anita C.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a great time here. The staff were all friendly and the restaurant was clean, inviting, and large enough to handle the busy streets of Montreal. We didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday evening. The food here was delicious and the food came out quick. I also very much liked their presentation of their sashimi/sushi platter. The dry ice was a very special touch. Everything is ordered with a tablet which I find really convenient. A must try are the lamb and squid skewers. They were as good as what you would find at an Asian street food market. I also liked how the sushi rolls weren't 50% rice. There was just enough rice with mostly filling in their rolls, something I never see at an ayce restaurant.Water was plentiful as they give you a bottle for the table and regularly replace it once it's empty. I have to say it may be one of the best service I've had at an ayce sushi restaurant. Our empty dishes were often picked up as soon as they were done. The reason for the 4-star is because of their tablet program. Each time you put an order in, you have to pick what table number you are. I can imagine it could be easy to accidentally order food to the wrong table. The tablet also glitched on us and didn't ask for a table number so we didn't receive the batch of orders. We had to reorder everything again once we realized the order didn't go through after waiting 15-30 mins. This will definitely be a favourite stop for sushi anytime I visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have nothing bad to say about this place! - The decor was nice- Price was 20$/person - The food was very good. The sashimi wasn't the freshest I've ever had, but it was definitely fresh. - The service was good compared to the service you can usually expect at AYCE sushi places - The presentation was great. The dry ice added a little oomph! - Ordering on the iPad is always nice. It was a little confusing at time, since you have to click your table before submitting your order, but we figured it out. I wasn't able to see a list of what we had ordered and what we have already received. That would be a very nice addition. I can't wait to go back. I think I've found my new go-to sushi place!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"Taiyo Sushi is a chain of AYCE sushi restaurants. I read great reviews of Taiyo Sushi in Longueuil and decided to give this St-Denis branch a shot. We came on a Sunday evening and it was almost full. Sunday evenings are  considered a weekday so the price was 25.99$. We were promptly greeted and seated. The location is spacious and casual, and also very familiar to me; I realized that I've been here before: the location used to be a Starbucks!Ordering is fairly straightforward: select whatever you want on an iPad and wait for the food to arrive. The waiters are friendly and pleasant. However, a few staff members seemed perpetually confused, walking around like a chicken with its head cut off, without knowing whether they were coming or going...As for the food, the presentation was excellent. After all, we do start eating with our eyes first. The sushi was not bad for an AYCE place. It certainly wasn't the worst I've had, but definitely not the most fresh. I also would have preferred less rice in my nigiri and my rolls. Pros:-high tech ordering (iPad)-extensive selection -pleasant ambiance-has sashimi-has red tuna nigiri (my litmus test for AYCE sushi)Cons:-lots of rice  -a bit stingy with the fish-waiters are very friendly, but a few were not very professional and seemed confused about the ordersOverall, it was a good eating experience. Adequate price and slightly above average AYCE sushi. I would return."

Ordered through iPad which is very convenient, and the food came with great presentation and also pretty fast. The waiter is also efficient and polite. We had a wonderful meal."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hm...reviews look amazing but I don't think I quite agree. I came on a sunday night and it took us a while to get seated, despite having a bunch of open tables. They explained how the ipad ordering system worked, but it was still a tad confusing. They have different menu specials for different days of the week, where sunday is categorized as a weekday. You might find yourself ordering a bunch of off-day items and realizing they'll never come because it's the wrong day.Anyways, the sashimi are the best items on the menu, they're decently fresh and beautifully plated. A little dish of dry ice really does the trick. Their selection of hot items are limited and quite mediocre. All the basic stuff is there but it's just not on par with other similar restaurants. Therefore, you'll end up ordering just sashimi and get tired of it quite quickly. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too, but are you really going to fill yourself up on rice at a AYCE sushi spot? Their desserts are good though, there's a wine soaked pear dessert that super wine forward and boozy. Conclusively, there's nothing I'm mad about but most AYCE sushi places in montreal are better."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place to come with friends if you're craving sushi. I especially like their digital iPad menus, your order goes to the kitchen directly. Their sushi variety may not be as big as other places, but the food is good. I'd say it's way better than your average all you can eat sushi. Their presentation is nice too so I definitely recommend."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For some reason, I thought I had heard good things about this place.With so many average sushi spots around town, it's nice when something stands out to set them apart (hopefully more good than bad). In this case I can only comment, or dare I say judge... from a quick takeout combo order, but seems was enough to get a 'good' feeling. The straight up 18 piece combo was even a perfect size for sharing. Every one for the three (California, Kamikaze and Salmon Hoso) rolls was fresh and on point. Nothing too flashy, just nice: non-fishy, non-slimy, non-smelly sushi. Ample ginger and wasabi were provided along with two sets of chopsticks and two individual soy sauces (great when one does not want wasabi added).The service was simple, polite and prompt. They also have a very cool hologram projector hanging over the sushi bar area, which was entertaining and very much out of a Blade Runner movie.The price was fair and enough napkins were provided (which helps if there is ever a minor or major soy spill). The dinning area seemed pleasant and not overly loud, so would be for a good date or group."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Checked out this AYCE sushi place a few days ago for dinner after seeing the good reviews and we were not disappointed! We showed up around 7:30 without reservations on a Friday night and despite the fact that it was packed, we were very quickly seated. We were told how to use the iPad to order and quickly got to work picking all the yummies we wanted to try. Service was quick, and the sushi was good. Was it super amazingly delicious? Not really, but it was fresh and tasty. That said, their strength definitely lies in their sushi/sashimi dishes rather than their cooked ones which we found fell very flat. Overall, a 3.5/5 but I rounded up because of their creative presentation of the dishes which we enjoyed."
/user_details?userid=90fyHymYCrcnfsAn7CDGXw,Stefanie R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We went there for sushi. It was very average. Even the edamame was under-seasoned.The ambience and service was good. Avoid the toilets late into the opening hours though. Seems no one is cleaning throughout the day.Not gonna go back. There are way too many other, and better options in Montreal for sushi."
/user_details?userid=u_89MyNZ3wUz_6J4w1IQeQ,Roy N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely an enjoyable AYCE sushi place. The price is very reasonable and they have a couple of things that you may not find elsewhere (like squid as sashimi) but they didn't have my favorite, which is Tuna sashimi or nigiri. I saw other reviews saying that the service was great, and while it wasn't bad per say, I did feel some pressure for eating too much after I ordered a second round. Generally a no-no when a place is supposed to be AYCE. That said, I do see myself coming back."

Cost is the same as all the other places but great taste and service. It's quaint and beautiful the food itself is great, the service is A class."

Next time I will try for dinner"
