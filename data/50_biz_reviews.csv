Mae Sri at Milton is a great choice for comfort if you're looking for lunch during the weekend! I'd describe this place with three straightforward words: tasty, convenient, and authentic. Take your pick between their various rice and noodle dishes, order upfront at the counter, and enjoy.It was a cold Sunday afternoon when I visited. The quality customer service appeared right away - the server sat me down and recommended me some fan favourites and personal choices. I decided to get the braised beef noodle soup ($16 after tax and tip) to warm myself up. In less than 5 minutes, the soup came - and how was it? Well, move over Nudo and Nouilles de Lan Zhou... there's a new noodle champion in town. The broth was aromatic and beefy, the braised meat was delicate, and the meatballs provided the salty kick that I was oh so craving. Add in the scallions for some freshness, and you have a deadly combination. I was honestly not expecting a Thai dish to be my favourite noodle experience in Montreal. But here we are!To keep it short, I expect to come here again. Several times at that. I wish they accepted Amex, but oh well. The next time you're craving Thai, give Mae Sri a shot."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We consulted the covid-19 yelp takeout list and decided to try Mae Sri. I had previously tried their sister restaurant Pamika and had been wanting to try Mae Sri ever since.Takeout experience was great. It's easy to order on their website, you a select a pick up time or delivery (Uber and skip the dishes). When I went to pick up my order was ready, they handed me my bag and that was it. Food was delicious and thankfully we ordered extra to have leftovers (delicious leftovers btw!). Fried chicken salad and the papaya salad were my favorite. I loved the marinades and the crunch of the salads. The green curry was also delicious and just the right level of spice. Baa Mee Haeng Moo Dang was also really good. It's essentially noodles, dumplings and what seemed like beets? It also comes in a soup form which is like to try next time.We also ordered the pad Thai, which was good but nothing special. Their other dishes are much more interesting and flavorful.Keep supporting your local businesses like Mae Sri, if you can!"

The environment is very friendly but in winter, you would probably need to keep your coat on since it is pretty cold inside. Every time I go to Mae sri, I would order the thai milk tea because it is delicious!If you don't know what it tastes like, here is my definition: it taste a little bit like caramel milk tea. Don't forget to ask for less ice!!! If you don't eat spicy, you can ask for the papaya salad without spice. The salad is refreshing, it's a good amount of spicy, salty and sweet. The imperial rolls are alright. As for the main meal, I love love love and recommend the green curry. It comes with vermicelli on the side, a bowl of green curry and tender chicken inside the curry. The way to eat it is by dipping the vermicelli inside the curry and scoop all of that yumminesss in one spoon!I have also tried out other dishes before such as the Ba mee noodles and the pad Thai. The ba mee noodles are good if you are looking for a more fresh soup with egg noodles and char siu plus some fragrant spices. As for the pad Thai, I enjoy it whenever I want some sweet and salty noodles with the perfect amount of egg, chicken and shrimp."

Best time to get fast service is at 1pm on weekends or early evening around 5:30."
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"I've tried Pamika Brasserie Thai before, and I had an amazing experience. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, and the restaurant's decor was gorgeous. So, when I found out that the same chef, Pamika Sukla, was behind Mae Sri, I was super excited. Mae Sri, compared to Pamika, is more of a fast-serving ""street food"" style experience. You order from the counter and pay in advance, and then your food is brought to your table.  The decor is simple and practical, yet also culturally inspired. There is great natural light (for the pictures!!), and their location is super convenient if you are a McGill student (like me ). We started off our meal with a Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee with condensed milk. Both drinks were extremely good and came in really cute bowls. I highly recommend the Thai iced coffee with condensed milk!!For the appetizers, we tried the papaya salad, the fried chicken salad and the Mae Sri fried rolls. The papaya salad is one of their most popular dishes, and for a reason. It is full of flavor and completely different from anything I've ever tried before. The rolls were also delicious, and are fried fresh upon ordering!! For our main meals, we tried the Mae Sri Pad Thai, the Baa Mee Moo, the Seafood Rad Na, the Green Curry and the Stir Fry with Thai Holy Basil. The green curry, like the one I tried at Pamika, was delicious. It also contained a lot of meat for the serving size, so we were very satisfied!! The Stir Fry with Thai Holy Basil was my favorite dish. It was really spicy, but so so good. It's packed with a lot of flavor and the portion size is really big. My sister, who I went with, was obsessed with the Pad Thai, for good reason too!! They also have to-go dessert packages: mango pudding or tapioca. The mango pudding was addictive!! I would buy half a dozen next time I go to bring them home with me  Overall, really good experience. Definitely recommend for a casual lunch or dinner experience. This location is especially convenient for McGill students, so I'm so happy that I found out about it!!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Mae Sri is definitely what it advertises to be, a Thai take out counter. It's a close walk from Place Des Arts metro. It's easy to walk past this place, because the door sign isn't visible. The decor us very nice, similar seating to Kinton Ramen with the block styled chairs. Nice you grab a seat, you'll find a small menu- drawback: there is no pictures of these dishes and everything seems to look like alike in words, but thank God for social media! The servers were actually quite friendly and honest about food portions and flavours, I really liked that. To order, you go up and order, pay and get a number like mandy's. To start we got the spring rolls x 4. These were good and no different than any Asian take out order. For the mains: wevopted to get a baa mee moo with noodles (12$) they comes with egg noodles, roasted pork, Asian Tak choy, dumplings and egg. I really loved this dish - better for 1 person than sharing. The second dish we got was the seafood rad na (15$) that comes with stir fry noodles, Asian kale, shrimp, calamari (barely any) and veggies. I did not enjoy this dish - it was a soupy very soupy but served in a plate - which made it hard to eat, and it wasa bit bland.  I tried the Thai iced tea tea (5$) with condense milk but didn't like it- way too sweet. More of an acquired taste. It cost 55$ in total amongst the two of us. I don't know if I would come back here, rather settle for Thai express."
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Mae Sri is a small neighborhood Thai restaurant in Milton Park just several blocks from downtown Montreal. Here's what's to love about it:1) Food: It's among the best food we've had in the city. It's a hybrid of fast-casual and a sit-down restaurant. They seat you when you enter, but you order at the front when you're ready. They have a wide variety of options from all the usual Thai suspects (green curry, pad Thai, papaya salad, etc) and a few more unique items. I ordered the veggie green curry and the coconut sauce was perfect as were the noodles. My wife ordered a delicious pad Thai and papaya salad.2) Service: Compared to other restaurants in the city, the service is faster and more friendly. They also have a booster seat for kids. 3) Space: It's beautiful with tables and wood stools. There's window seating as well.4) Wifi: It's free and strong. The password as of August 2019 is ""maesrithai.""One thing to note:1) The Thai iced tea was not my favorite. It came out in a small silver bowl with too much ice and WAY too sweet. I almost didn't finish it.Overall, if you want good Thai food, go to Mae Sri!"
/user_details?userid=0Zswwlz4NzUJoG-skyWzIw,Tania L.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Didn't expect to find Thai food this great in Montreal! We purposely made a stop here due to the raving reviews, and Mae Sri definitely impressed. The concept is fast casual - you line up, and they don't take your order until there are available seats. After paying, you're then directed to an empty table to sit and eat.We ordered a papaya salad to share; I then got the Kuai Tiao Tom Yum, my sister the Thai Hainan steamed chicken, my Dad the Pad Kra Pao, and my Mom the Crispy Pork Belly. I sampled all, and they were all so delicious!Papaya saladThis appetizer was a pretty solid and generous portion - and quite spicy too! The spice added a pleasant kick to the raw papaya, with the lime balancing things out with a tangy sourness.Thai Hainan steamed chickenFor those who love the original Hainanese steamed chicken, you must try this out! My sister loves her Hainanese chicken, and we were blown away by this dish. The chicken was so silky smooth and flavourful! The rice was also delicious, having absorbed all the chicken oil / essence.Pad Kra PaoI only had a small bite of this, but it didn't taste vastly different from those from other places. By this, I mean it met expectations and was quite good nevertheless.Crispy Pork BellyThis was an interesting dish, and very delicious! The pork belly highly resembles the ones from Chinese cuisine, but are fried to be a great crisp and offer an amazing bite! Kuai Tiao Tom YumThis dish was the least exceptional, though the tom yum broth was still quite flavourful. It was the ultimate comfort meal, however. The rice noodles readily absorbed the broth, and offered a taste of home with each bite. I particularly enjoyed the many shrimps and the soft-boiled egg, though the meatballs were mediocre and not my favourite.Overall, the meal was amazing. The service was also quite friendly; the staff were all smiles and super accommodating. Would highly recommend!"

But again its a small intimate kind of setting. If you are driving here, parking is a major issue as all majority of the spots in nearby streets have resident parking permit requirement. You can't reserve a table, you need to stand and wait at restaurant.Coming to food, presentation is good but all dishes were way too sweet and had some fish after taste, some fish oil variant must have been used in dishes (Pad Thai and Stir Fry Vegi). Chicken Soup was good and flavorful but again not the best I have had in past. At least couple of staff members seemed overwhelmed with crowd in the restaurant."

The pad Thai sauce was unbelievably delicious, typically I don't eat all the pad Thai just because it comes in such a huge portion but it was so good, I literally couldn't stop eating and ended up eating the whole plate in one sitting! The place is fairly casual and such a comfortable atmosphere. The service was A+ as well!"

It was quite good; tasty good amount of sea food; calamari and shrimp, for the price you pay. Not very spicy. The presentation is superb. My friend ordered pad Thai; unfortunately it wasn't to her taste. There's better pas thais. I had a bite; it was ok. I was happy with my soup noodle. Overall, friendly staffs,  cute little place for a quick Thai snack after school or in between classes."

The food presentation was beautiful and the portions are reasonable (if you're hungry: get a side dish!). The noodles came out a little soggy to my taste, but the sauce makes up for it: each bite tasted delicious and the flavour is perfectly balanced! A little bit spicy, sour and sweet. They also have Thai condiments to season your food. A must try! Their desserts tasted okay.The restaurant's ambiance and the decoration is really nice: casual and chic. Even though their place was packed, their service was quick and we didn't had to wait long before getting served.Definitely a place to visit with friends for a quick bite!"

We tried their noodles, curry, boat noodle soup, appetizers, they all tasted wonderful and according to my friend, it's not common in Montréal to have delicious Asian food!They opened not long ago but has already been busy because we saw people still coming in as late as 10pm. The service was great and friendly. The food came out pretty quickly too. The dining room had stool chairs so it's not the most comfortable seating but it's OK. The air circulation could be better. We hanged our coats on the rack and came out smelling like grease haha. Good French pâtisseries and restaurants might be everywhere in Montréal, but it isn't easy to find an authentic and delicious Thai restaurant. It's wonderful to see such a restaurant in the city."

It was packed but the service was fast which is fitting for the concept of "" cheap "" street food. You have to order at the cash and they bring your dishes at your table. The place itself is simple but well decorated. The service was good and fast. We don't find Hanainese Chinese often on menus so my friend and I both ordered that dish out of curiosity to compare to what we had in Thailand. It was quite tasty! My cousin ordered the green curry dish which he found good but tad too sweet for his liking. The dishes are overall quite tasty but portions are small. Perhaps more authentic than other Thai restos but of course not comparable to dishes in Thailand :p  They don't serve alcohol which was too bad.I would still come back if I'm around the neighbourhood to try other dishes. Oh and I noticed there were quite a few vegetarian options on the menu which is great."

They have so many great dishes for everyone- vegetarians, people who like spicy food, people who can't handle the spice, etc. Their menu is inspired by the street food in Bangkok and we really think they pulled it off- even though we haven't made it to Bangkok for a visit yet! We tried so much and enjoyed it all!To start, we tried the Thai iced coffee with condensed milk and the Thai lemon iced tea... loved that the drinks were filled with little ice pieces, instead of the usual big cubes and loved the touch of the condensed milk in the coffee, it's worth a try.For the appetizers, we tried homemade Mae Sri fried rolls (nothing like any spring roll you've ever had), the spicy papaya salad and fried chicken salad. That papaya salad really lives up to its hype! Regarding the main meals, we tried (among other things) Baa Mee Moo, Pad Thai Mae Sri, green Curry with rice noodles and the seafood Rad Na! We recommend the homemade pad Thai and the green curry with rice noodles the most- even though we were pleased with everything! The pad Thai is is packed with such delicious and real flavours- we've only ever had it in a fast food place, so it was such a different experience this time.Out of the desserts offered to us, we preferred the mango pudding! So sweet and a perfect way to end such a delicious meal in good company! Something that really stood out here was that all the ingredients were just so fresh- were stuffed at the end, but a good stuffed lol Thanks to Gabriel for the amazing service and for explaining the menu so well :)Thanks for opening our eyes to authentic Thai food, we will definitely be back!"

I arrived early, took five spots for me and my friends. Within the 10 minutes the restaurant was filling up. I was worried I am going to loose the table if my friends weren't there any time soon. The host of the restaurant, came to tell me the same thing as I thought of loosing table, which I understand but the host was had a very threatening tone. He was creepy and scary. Thankfully, my friends arrived. Their system is you order your food at counter and pay. By the time, it's ordered and paid, my food arrived right away on my table. It was quickest service ever! I had the papaya salad which was so good, spicy, flavorful, fresh and so delicious. My vegetarian rad na was a disappointment; it hadn't any flavor; it was so bland. It's a 50/50 with this place."

Hidden in the Mcgill ghetto, this is the best Thai restaurant within 20-30min radiance. What I appreciate the most is how they are bold enough to not removing those ""weird"" but authentic Asian ingredients just because some locals find them too ""special"" (while, those picky locals can always order an pad Thai and be super happy with it). However, order some spicy noodle dishes if you want to try some ingredients that you would not find in any other Thai restaurants in Montreal."

I was very impressed by the staff that was very helpful and gave us free rice for the inconvenience. The next day we ordered from them again because it was cold out and we didn't feel like going out. I'm Thai so I'm pretty particular and will only write for a Thai place that I think their food is authentic and tastes like what I had back home. I ordered the Glass Noodle Salad (Yum Woon Sen with Moo Yor) and it was really really good like what my grandma used to make for me. I've also tried their Ba-Mee- Moo-Dang (Yellow Noodle with roasted pork) which I would recommend as well. I'm glad that I have found a Thai place to go to next time I'm in Montreal!"

The crispy pork belly was flavorful but it wasn't crispy at all. Their thai iced tea had a good tea flavor, but it came in a tiny jar. Overall, the food is good but the portions were very small.  Even though we shared 6 dishes, we left the restaurant hungry and went to get food somewhere else.

I liked it so much that I brought my friend here the 2nd time (photo 2). I had the Tom Yum soup and my friend had the beef noodles soup. The Tom Yum soup was so delicious, like nothing I had taste before (including when I was in Thailand). We both loved it so much and came back for lunch a couple days later. We both tried something else. I loved my soup, if I remembered correctly, should be Suki soup. We loved the chicken salad more than the papaya salad.  Today, Jan 6, 20, brought my other friend to try Mae Sri (lunch). And I was dying to have the Tom Yum soup again. I had the first taste, it was 100% different than what I had the first time. I thought I ordered the wrong item. And tried the soup again, didn't taste right. I called over the waiter and asked and was told that's the soup base they use. Sorry I didn't take any photo today, my friend ordered the chicken soup, is the same broth as hers. Tom Yum definitely does not taste like plain chicken soup. If I have never had Tom Yum at Mae Sri, I would just assumed this is another failed Thai restaurant. Yet the Tom Yum soup I had in November was not the same broth! The waiter offered to give me more Tom Yum paste and extra lime on the soup. I tried it all and still doesn't taste right. He kept saying this was their soup base, and if I ordered anything else, he won't be able to refund me the $. I ate the noodles & seafood, didn't take another zip of the soup. The waiter came again and told me they have different chefs in the noon & evening. No wonder! But how could there be such a day & night different in taste? Is totally a different soup! Shouldn't there be a standard???? I was so disappointed. The waiter offered 1 tapioca dessert for the 2 of us. In this case, never come here for lunch! I would not recommend to any of my friends again."

The dish was a bit too spicy for me. I added a fried egg on top ( for 2$) and the fried egg was over cooked.

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place had been a breakfast spot before opening as Mae Sri in November last year. We went tonight around 8h and the place was pretty full. We got seated at the windows after about 5 min, and decided on what to order. I didn't know that ordering was at the counter, so ended up waiting for awhile before a server clarified the situation. We got papaya salad, Pad Thai Mae Sri, Kuai Tiao Tom Yum, Thai Red Syrup with Milk and a Tapioca for dessert. The food came very fast, and was beautifully plated on banana leaves and enamel plates. Portions were not huge but reasonable (leaving room for side dishes!). The pad thai and tom yum soup were good, with well balanced flavors and fresh ingredients. The red syrup drink was fruity and very sweet, but with a smooth finish thanks to the milk. The star, however, was the papaya salad. From the first bite to the last, the salad absolutely **rocked** my world. Very few dishes can marry so many strong flavors - the sweetness of palm sugar, tartness of lime juice, punch of hot chili, pungence of fish sauce - and textures. I couldn't get enough of it! The level of spice was much bolder than I expected, which was a fantastic surprise (just like seeing snow fungus, pork blood and morning glory on the menu!!). Unfortunately, the tapioca was a bit of a miss, as its texture had hardened with the cold. We were very happy with the food, service and pricing. The restaurant had a simple but beautiful interior, with warm, dim lights and cozy wooden structures. A lot of attention was paid to details, down to the choice of tableware and cutlery holders. Bonus points for the restaurant's website's beautiful photos and comprehensive menu, which indicates the name of each item in Thai script, romanized Thai and English. So happy Mae Sri is in the neighborhood!!"

I'm feeling lucky these days because I've discovered so many hidden gems in close proximity to my job at McGill!Anyway, back to Mae Sri Thai. You walk in, pay at the counter, have a seat and your food is brought out to you. The quantity + quality of food that you get for the price is almost unbeatable. I've had three dishes (pictures attached); they were all very flavourful and delicious. The food is prepped very quickly, so it's a great option if you'd like a good meal and don't have too much time.With that being said, though the food is great, however it's not quite up to the standard of The flagship location, Pamika yet. I say ""yet"" because Mae Sri is still fairly new and since the owners are the same, I'm sure they'll be up to par soon.In any event, I recommend Mae Sri. However, I REALLY recommend Pamika!"

They opened not too long ago and it's a more casual and cafeteria style restaurant where you order at the counter. The inside is very clean and has a nice ambiance.The food came fast and was beautifully presented. For 2 people, we got the green curry ($16) which I highly recommend, one of the noodle soups (forgot what it was called unfortunately but they're $12-15), the papaya salad (super fresh and delicious with a little spice $10), the seafood set ($12) and finally a thai iced coffee with condensed milk ($5). It was certainly a lot of food for 2 but the portions are pretty good in general for the mains (appetizers and salads are a little smaller).The prices are higher than some other small over the counter restaurants but it's justified by the freshness and quality of the ingredients.

The chicken came with bones and cartilage, including all the tiny and sharp bones. I had to fish it out of the curry to be able to eat it. Very cumbersome. There were no napkins anywhere. Not going back."

The rice portion was small, but I liked their red nectar drink (which was great at nullifying their really spicy chili!), and their tapioca was nice.Second time I went there, 2 stars. I ordered green curry, and God it was awful. It was so runny and liquidy and bland. They served noodles with it, which was weird but whatever. But it was a small amount of noodles, so I asked for their overpriced rice ($3 per bowl). And two bowls of it since I was famished. But the curry made me want to puke. But since I don't like wasting food, I finished my rice anyways.Average it out, 3 stars."

I tried the pad thai which was pretty good! It was a bit too chewy for my liking but the taste overall was really good! The bean sprouts on top were kind of odd. I'm not too sure if it's part of the garnish or what, but maybe they could be cooked or something?? I'm going to go again to check out the other items on their menu! P.S. It's also self serve. You pay and then sit down!"

Great medley of different flavours, one of the best thai salads I've ever had.Baa Mee Haeng Moo Dang is horrible. I don't know if it's ""authentic"", but it definitely isn't ""good"". It literally is a noodle soup without soup. On the menu it's in the same section as pad thai so I figured it'd have some sort of sauce. Nope, no sauce, literally a bowl of undressed cooked noodles with a bunch of toppings.I'd go back but would definitely avoid the Baa Mee Haeng Moo Dang next time."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I discovered this place through ads on Instagram as I follow their other restaurant, Pamika, I guess?I was very excited to try it out. As it is a counter format, it seemed simple enough. So I gathered some friends and we were a group of 8 quite eager to have some good noodles. The place is cute. Simple in decoration style. They were so newly opened that there were no coat hooks.... whatever, we piled our stuff on the floor next the the table.The waitress/hostess was very friendly, we chitchatted while I waited for my friends because I was the first one there. People started to come in more and more and I thought this was gonna be awesome!!!It started with ordering... my order was pretty straightforward but the waitress messed up & charged me for something else. She was very apologetic. Human errors, all good! Then she tried to explain to her boss, it went well. They said they'd flag the kitchen to make sure I get the right soup.Then came the soups. They were so unequal from one to another in term of quantity inside the bowls. And these bowls are flat, so if I can see the bottom of the bowl, there isn't a lot of food in there, is there... AND the heat didn't stay long... Then obviously the kitchen came out with the wrong order of my food.. Fine, whatever. They went to verify and came back with the right one. The menu is also inconsistent with what is spicy and what isn't. One of us took a soup that isn't spicy and ended up leaving half of it because she couldn't handle it, despite having no warning anywhere.Then as we started to eat, which took longer than we are used to, we realized that one of us never got her food. And it's been a long time. She asked the waiter and he said he'd check. 15 mins later still nothing, at this point it must have been REALLY long, because I eat slow and I was half way into the soup already (or because there wasn't a lot, I don't know..) I had to flag it AGAIN. Finally she got her order plus the appetizers that should have came out much earlier. They then offered us some appetizers on the house to apologize for the delay and mix ups.Now, the food was good. Some better than others. But the whole scenario really deflated us & I'm not sure we'd come back... I undertand with newly opened places, etc, but when you open a restaurant, especially already owning another one, shouldn't you be READY? Honestly for the price vs quantity and quality, it's kinda expensive. I hope they change it up a bit to improve."

The cozy decor and incredible service compliment the always delicious and fresh food that Pamika is known for. I tried the vegetarian green curry, which is surprisingly served with rice noodles here unlike the normal rice. They even added some fried tofu upon my request! I love the vibe of this spot- place your order at the counter and find a comfortable seat. The food is out so quickly! Plenty of seating too. Be careful though, it's difficult to eat the curry with noodles, you'll need extra napkins. The menu is decently priced. My meal was $16 but there are cheaper dishes on the menu. I highly recommend it and can't wait to come back and try more things."

I've been to Thailand and I can say that it's definitely the most authentic thai restaurant you can find in Montreal. Everything tastes quite good except for some appetizers (don't order the boiled seafood/meat dish, it tastes bland). They serve different types of delicious noodle soups. If it's your first time, i would definitely recommend ordering the pad thai, pad sew ew and the thai iced tea!"
/user_details?userid=CZIABQgavGBUOZJBYs5egQ,Autish D.,"Vienna, VA",5 star rating,"Mae Sri is a small restaurant. They specialize in noodle soups. Overall I loved the food here. Their Thai Braised Beef soup and their Chicken Soup were delicious. We also tried their Crispy Pork Belly which was excellent too. The soups are fairly large and very filling. The pork belly was slightly smaller. In vegetarian selection, if you don't eat fish sauce please check what has fish sauce and what doesn't. Several items on the menu marked vegetarian had fish sauce.  The vegetarian Pad Thai was excellent. The ice teas were on the small side and had too much ice, which watered down the flavor. They ask you to place the order at the counter. The people there were incredibly helpful, the overall service was excellent and the food was great."

I had to add so much spice, fish sauce and soya garlic pepper sauce for it to be OK. i will never understand how a restaurant with such basic food can be so popular. Although their thai iced tea was delicious, not worth going back. I will never return and would never recommend to anyone.... unless i dislike them"

The food and service is fantastic. The only thing I would say is that the portion size is small for the money you're paying. I really love the braised beef soup which I've gotten 3 times now. It comes to be around $17 with tip and tax. I always leave each time feeling like I should've ordered two portions because I'm not quite full enough (and I don't think my appetite nor the portion sizes I'm used to are unreasonably large). I would still probably come back because I really do love the people there and I do like the soup a lot. I just wish it was either slightly cheaper for the same size, or the same price as now but slightly bigger portion size. I've also tried their popular ""fried chicken"" and rice. The food here is quite good. Above average for sure - but overall, I'm not sure if it is worth the price point."

We tried the spicy porc belly and pad thai. They were both delicious. Their home brewed cold teas were also good but a little on the sweet side.  Staff is friendly despite the quick turnover of tables and in and out of people coming in for takeout. Portions are a little on the small side. I was still hungry after eating. They have gluten free options on the menu as well. I will be back! I'm gonna try the entire menu.

From what I was told the restaurant was up and running for about 10 days, you would never know it it already operated like a fine oiled machine. I can't stress enough how accommodating, how friendly, how knowledgeable the wait staff was in describing and recommending dishes. Everything was amazing. The fried chicken salad I am still talking about.  Good luck, with your new restaurant .  Not that you would need it !  Incredible value. We walked out with to go containers.

Food is delicious, we got the vege green curry and crispy pork belly. For appetizers we got the pork and beef set - super good and fun to dip into the sauce. Portions might seem small compared to other places but really they are more than enough to get you full without feeling bloated. Crispy pork belly was good but not much different from Japanese Katsu or Korean places. However the green curry is pretty unique and a must have!!! can't wait to come back for new dishes!"
/user_details?userid=dmprdDTSUebCPeTBGFxu5Q,Patrick E.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,Service was good and their menu had a lot of variety.  The food came out fast but it was just average. Not the worst Thai food I've had in Montreal but certainly not the best.  We ordered the chicken pad see ew and the papaya salad along with two Thai iced teas. The Thai iced teas were delicious and came out in little bowls. I give them props for creativity but I also felt cheated by the small amount of the beverage.  Papaya salad was okay but had some strange ingredients in it that aren't normally in papaya salad.  Pad see ew was disappointing.  The chicken was chewy and the flavors were off.  We could not finish it.  It was a nice place because it was open late but it was expensive.  There are better Thai options in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=n_qegtThC71PIIvw6oWGzQ,Pr N.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1 star rating,"Bad service, literally inedible food.  This is by far one of the worst restaurants I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The food they served was literally inedible because it was a bowl of bones. They claim it is their chicken curry but it is all chicken bones and skin packed into a bowl, covered with some curry. It is like a soup with nothing but bones and cartilage in it, not only large bones and knuckles, but also many tiny and sharp bones that you could easily choke on, break a tooth or cut your mouth on. When I told them that my curry was all bones and wanted to send it back, they took it back to the kitchen and actually put more bones in it! The service is also bad, my dining partner did not receive their meal until at least 10 minutes after my bowl of bones was served. We noticed that other diners also did not have their meals arrive at the same time. I do not know how this place is even in business serving such disgusting fare, they should be shut down by the health department for serving food that can harm someone.  With so much amazing food in Montreal, please keep stepping."

First and for most we took 2 entrees to start. We had the papaya salad and Mae Sri Rolls. They were delicious! The papaya salad was more on the spicy side and had some major kick. The rolls were so crispy and full of flavour. We then grabbed 2 mains, the Thai Braised beef soup and the chicken greeny curry. We loved all of it. The beef in the soup was melt in your mouth, the broth was very tasty and comforting and the noodles were chewy and consistent. The green curry was really creamy and full of spice. We loved the chicken, although served not in piece but a whole chicken thigh, it was kind of hard to eat unless you eat with your hands. Other than that, we really enjoyed the experience and atmosphere. Likes the fact you had to order at the counter and then sit down and wait for your meal. Made the experience a little more original. I recommend it."
