/user_details?userid=6dbq9ZZL-NqVkHnCHvyDOQ,Topaz T.,"North Canton, OH",5 star rating,"Loved the ambience, friendly, attentive staff, drink selection and menu. Travelling alone and wanted to stop for a quick drink. The music drew me in. Hand crafted cocktails made with flare. Small and interesting environment. I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",3 star rating,"$2 Oyster is what drew us in quick when we strolled past License one morning. After that, hubs and I looked at each other and made a mental note to stop in on a Friday night. License's style is quite literally swoon-worthy: large gold-frame mirrors, mind-blowing chandelier and these random large paintings stealing the show. But the in-house DJ playing English and French House music- was the sh*t- even if I was dancing on my chair. Hubs and I had a mission to come in for cocktails (and Mocktails) and a dozen Oysters then bounce. License made me a Piña Colada Mocktail (only with Coconut milk) and was good. While hubs first Cosmo drink lacked majorly. His 2nd (Tito's) Vodka & Cranberry drink had way too much ice- so go figure. Our dozen Oysters on the half-shell with Mignonette had a silky and wonderful texture- but they rested on rice....¯\_(ツ)_/¯??? And every time we'd picked up an Oyster, we had to scrape the rice off the shell. I got a little tip....rest them on ice why don't you- the way it should be done? Listen... Service was nice and this restaurant's menu reads like a five star restaurant.....but it missed."
/user_details?userid=A5FnteBcoOCdydcHxgpfIw,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The owners openly harassed an Asian passerby and had ""No coronavirus here"" written on their windows. They even had the audacity to come outside to continue the harassment and threatened the passerby to call the police because she had decided to film them in case something happened.It's outrageous that owners of an establishment lash out on a passerby that has absolutely nothing to do with them."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The ambiance of this small restaurant is fantastic! Cool music, low lights, brick walls, ""R"" rated burlesque type movies playing on the brick wall behind the bar.I sat at the bar and ordered the charcuterie board and a glass of wine. The food was excellent with large heaping portions of different hams and salamis. Great mix of textures and flavours.The staff was attentive and friendly, particularly the bartenders who went out of their way to make me feel welcome. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the relatively small wine pours and the fact that the manager refilled my glass (that had an ounce or two remaining) without asking. I honestly thought he was comp-ing the top off but I was charged for a full glass. No big deal but maybe you should ask first.Other than that small hiccup I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and look forward to returning."
/user_details?userid=7NSy5STfsC0tEfBBfSFUiw,Lillian L.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,Racist establishment!! Avoid at all costs. People who perpetuate xenophobia should not be supported. facebook.com/504077854/p…
/user_details?userid=TARg0drw5FXS3WNKbheawA,Gwen W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,"This business is owned by racists who harass  strangers on the street. Don't support them, they don't deserve it."
/user_details?userid=tHmDobEdXRUiJjQk3-yudg,Catherine -.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"Racist owner, joking about a tragedy is his way of getting business. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all"
/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Terrible owners that were racist towards an asian woman. Making corona virus jokes and yelling at her after.
/user_details?userid=RXMouppkuXjWwfrOxcYSoQ,Connie P.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"The head bartender and possibly the owner was sketchy. We were told that we needed to buy food in order to have drinks, but saw others (friends) drinking without alcohol. Was also told that all the bartenders around help each other out and essentially can drink for free at each establishment. Does that mean that they also have to buy food, or is it just a scam for tourists? We were there on our honeymoon and did not get a good vibe. The drinks were good but there was something off about it all.Another note, place is small, and if you ask for them to make you a drink, be prepared to pay a lot, because that price is not listed on the menu and you have no idea what it will cost you.Go nextdoor to wolf and Workman. Friendly staff, wonderful decor, great ambience, and you won't feel like you are being taken advantage of. Coming from Chicago, and having experience with many, many dining establishments and bars, this place did not feel right. Many other great places to visit in Montreal. You can leave this one off your radar."
/user_details?userid=Lz-eO4TfcmDMSvvYqLnPmA,Carmenn O.,"FLUSHING, NY",1 star rating,"Saw a local news about the racist joke incident and realized that the owner took no ownership about his ""bad joke"". He implied that the victim was overreacting, being aggressive and defensive towards his ""joke"" as if she didn't get his sense of humor. Meanwhile, he didn't apologize to the community about his ""bad joke"" and realize the serious matter that is caused by his sense of humor. People suffered, panicked and died from this disease. It is disrespectful to use this as a joke. 100% will not support local business that is owned by a person like this."
/user_details?userid=bFGR7y2K1cVCD5xOIm3xLw,Florence K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Ignorant owner making racist remarks and followed by a childish excuse. I won't feel welcome in this restaurant. Information about this incident is on this CBC news article further down:cbc.ca/news/canada/briti…
/user_details?userid=pL5fKHa6bkzUIzCyF_dJHA,Nicholas G.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"So yelp says this is a new restaurant/bar. It's not getting off on the right foot. I walked by here after dinner on a Friday. It had a good vibe from the street, but it was near 11pm on a Friday and there were several empty seats at the bar. I told the front door tout I wanted to grab a drink at the bar (blaring red light when you have someone at the front door trying to entice you in). He said I could only have a seat at the bar if I bought food. I said I just came from dinner and was just looking for a drink. He said food is only 2.50 for an appetizer and made it look like I was the jerk for not buying food I didn't want. Well, long story short, it was 80F/30C degrees and I had already walked past some even more blatant tourist traps, so I went in for one martini and one $5 app (didn't see the mythical 2.50 food). I spent the entire time on yelp to find info on the (many) better bar options in the area. So, Yelp good, License IV bad. Make your customers want your food, don't make people order things they don't want for the privilege of sitting at a bar that had more empty seats when I left than when I arrived."
/user_details?userid=lU9rZ3nVBgyxochS0vP28Q,Tommy L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Bar owner and act like a dumb ignorant racist fuck toward Asian lady. Terrible, ignorant racists. I hope the bar will get boycott and take a big economy hit after this"
/user_details?userid=rS1iWKRclwrR62TWkraEzQ,Christine M.,"Henderson, NV",5 star rating,"Excellent selection of local and Gins from around the world.  Loved the vibe of this restaurant. Awesome music, fun people, exceptional service! Delicious French Onion soup, escargot and chimichurri steak."
/user_details?userid=BdMEmCZMxmBL64IkfMvXzA,Scott B.,"Littleton, CO",5 star rating,"My wife and I arrived at this quaint little restaurant on a Tuesday evening. We had a dozen oysters that were specially priced at two dollars each. We also shared the cheese platter, which had several local cheeses, olives, artichoke, and fresh bread. The meal was excellent along with two glasses of red wine. The ambience is upscale and yet relaxed.We will return again!"
/user_details?userid=qW66uJcZEtejwMLP5pwtEg,Nick K.,"Batavia, IL",5 star rating,This is my first time in a gin bar. Definitely must try. A variety of delicious local gin with a hint of tonic.  I loved Bleu Royal the most (blue color disappears as you add tonic). Holy Smoke and Dandy Old Tom were also delicious.
/user_details?userid=a3i6Xz7rQ7u09jOrmY4g9A,Georgette F.,"Southlake, TX",5 star rating,If a bar could look like Anthropologie with a twist this would be it. Tasty cocktails with great lounge music. Recommend the raspberry fizz and spicy margarita. Yum!

/user_details?userid=jDqEQYh6QMPWgU5tmLZwvA,Samantha P.,"San Mateo, CA",1 star rating,There's been proof of racism from the owners of this establishment. They threatened a civilian that wasn't doing anything other than walking by.
/user_details?userid=sYXjMZJazYrjDBwBkYf40w,Cathy N.,"Berczy Village, Markham, Canada",1 star rating,The restaurant owners were racist by writing inappropriate messages on their door and yelling at a lady making it far from a welcoming establishment.  Do yourself a favour and eat someplace else that doesn't encourage a$$hole behaviour.
/user_details?userid=UWr79yf0ZqrpwgLPg8bSJg,Andrew S.,"Milford, MI",4 star rating,Grabbed some oysters and mojitos before a night out and were pleasantly surprised by the speed and quality of the food. Drinks weren't very strong and the projector was playing Cabaret videos which didn't match the ambience and was a little bit uncomfortable if you bring children with you.
/user_details?userid=Jnm1Nsq3rsouVaNnESrbFA,Kate W.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Amazing staff!  We are visiting from Chicago and they accommodated the entire family.  The oysters were fresh and delicious. The poutine was some of the best we've had.  The drinks were stiff. Our server was super energetic and friendly.  They had an amazing DJ and the ambiance was perfect.  Check this place out!!
/user_details?userid=ZEFOFdCEbyl6qTGlPU58Hw,Zhenai X.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"People are dying around the world and this restaurant has the audacity to joke about the virus. The only reason why Montreal and Canada have been less affected by the epidemic is because of our isolated geographical location in comparison to densely populated and interconnected regions such as Lombardy and other places in Europe, NOT because we have been ""more careful"" or have taken better precautionary measures than them! Remember that your ability to enjoy a ""private party and just have some fun"" is a privilege, and you definitely have no right to disrespect the individuals struck by this virus and all the health care workers fighting for people's lives around the world!"
/user_details?userid=ggQDnr4gwsmUw8q7H6jNUw,Alex D.,"Brussels, Belgium",5 star rating,"Excellent atmosphere, original cocktails, and the food is great. Nice lighting and music creating a good atmosphere."
/user_details?userid=_PQjYUAgdRepbkIjqny_kw,Nathan K.,"East Point, GA",5 star rating,"Walked in at an odd hour so it wasn't busy, but the staff was friendly, the atmosphere was right, and the cocktails were good. We were only there to drink, but staff gave us a couple of crackers. Evidently their license requires them to serve food with any drink. Not sure what's up with some of the bad reviews, but it's suspicious that a few of them recommend the place next door."
/user_details?userid=y-M5XexATumz5LVLqZbAmg,Jay K.,"Tannersville, NY",3 star rating,"Food was fine. Burger was messy and the pasta was okay. French Onion soup was pretty good too. I previously had an issue with a charge here. Manager was apologetic, kind, and helpful."
/user_details?userid=WOS95T8v6lUfWbJfSr2hog,Nadine A.,"Carolina Beach, NC",1 star rating,"As the owner of businesses, one of which is a bar, I was completely appalled by the manager of this establishment.  He obviously does not care to have paying customers even when his bar is almost empty.  As soon as we sat down he impatiently asked us what we wanted to drink from the bar without even offering us a menu.  This was right after I had just finished cleaning a dead bug off of the bench in order to sit down.  Since we weren't offered a menu and he seemed impatient, I just ordered a glass of Prosecco. He answered, ""We don't have that.""  After coming back with menus, it clearly listed Prosecco by the glass.  We decided to leave because of his rude attitude and went next door to Wolf & Workman where we had excellent service.  Later, I realized that I had left my sunglasses on the seat at Licence IV and went back to get them. I walked in and told the same manager that I thought I had left my glasses at the table.  He didn't even try looking for my glasses or ask anyone else.  Just told me that my glasses weren't there.  I left but came back about 10 minutes later to ask about my glasses again, despite his rudeness, because I was almost positive that I had left them there. He looked me right in the eye and said, ""I clean every one of the tables and chairs myself so I know that you did NOT leave your glasses here."" After telling him that I didn't appreciate his attitude, I asked to search the table myself (the other customer had left) and wouldn't you know it, there were my glasses sitting right there on the floor in plain view! Horrible customer service!  Stay away!"
