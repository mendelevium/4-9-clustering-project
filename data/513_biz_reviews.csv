/user_details?userid=yBzusnZmw_QcETaUyVfWdg,Grant L.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,I've only ever had their pita but don't feel the need to expand my repertoire. The pita is excellent. Really a large meal. Staff is very friendly. Service is quick.
/user_details?userid=DwuLtfL0_A-Kk4EwO10Rww,Sylvie Q.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Good food, fresh soft falafels, not dry and kind of hard like other places but the pita wrap was soaked in oil in the bag & they put my straw upside down. They forgot to put utensils & napkins. They wanted to be fast but they also need to think about the practical aspect! The mint in one of the lemonade was a nice touch for the presentation & the taste. They forgot to put it in the other cup. I really don't think that there was a lot of falafels in my plate. I was expecting more. Plus, the employee at the cashier was kind of rude & straightforward when he told us to wait outside, speaking loudly. It was a deceiving experience knowing the reputation of this restaurant. Step it up!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The husband picked up a Falafel Sandwich & Hummus Platter to share. We decided to eat at home. Our total bill was $21. The food was good. However we asked for spicy and it was still a little bland for our taste. We are happy we tried a new place, but it definitely wasn't the best we have had, so the search shall continue!!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"4.5 starsI was reallllllly excited for this place to open. But then I went on vacation and forgot about it until I came back a month later and was walking down St-Viateur and there it was! Open for business!! It took about 1 week for Adam and I to try almost the entire menu. On the first visit we both got the pita (full size to see if we could handle it, he could, I couldn't), a lemonade, and the fries.Second visit we just went to try the dessert chocolate tahini balls in all 5 flavours (coconut, rainbow sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles, cocoa, sesame). Third visit we got the hummus to share (it is a BIG plate)To be honest, I was sold after the first visit. The falafels really are THAT good. Warm and packed with flavour. The dessert is unique but I think the coconut one is the best, the flavours work better together. The hummus is a great way to grab a shareable lunch to go.They really give you value for money here, the portions have always been way more than I anticipated.I love what they did with the space, the decor is so aesthetic. They also have a sink in the middle to wash your hands and the soap smells really good."

/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing falafel sandwich Israeli style!!! Really well spiced and dressed. Finally an amazing falafel place in the Mile End which was much needed. Their limonana ( mint lemonade) was extremely fresh and refreshing. Staff is super cool and friendly! Come by and try their yummy creations!!!
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Falafel!   I love this Middle Eastern dish so Falafel Yoni turned out to be a great find.  They specialize in Israeli falafel as opposed to the Lebanese falafel that we typically find here in Montreal.  It's a fast serve place and they have a small, focused menu.  There isn't much seating so you might have difficulty getting a seat if it's busy.Bring your appetite with you because the portions are very generous.  I ordered a full pita sandwich and it was massive.  Despite being someone with a massive appetite I struggled to finish it.  The flavours were amazing though!  Next time I would probably order the half sandwich.  The fries that accompanied it were solid.  I washed that down with a limonana, which was a mint lemonade which wasn't too sweet at all and really refreshing.Prices might seem a bit high but given the quality and portion size I felt that they were fair.  I paid a little less than $20 for the sandwich, fries and drink, but given how much food I got and how much I enjoyed it that wasn't too expensive for me."
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I'm not an expert of falafel but this was quite a notch up from the usual pita suspects. The spicy option adds just enough kick to the perfectly flavour-balanced crunchy creamy mix. Oh and the regular sized (very generous) pita is under $10.Another Montreal institution.
/user_details?userid=z3fTsodnVjP6uPwYWO5cRA,Rachel F.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,"Worth the visit. Good, cheap, and fast Middle Eastern. The pickles were exactly how I like my Israeli pickles and the falafel were light and flavorful. Oh also presentation was well done."
/user_details?userid=CgtJmdIg0Xd7n5kJBaczHA,Frederick C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had the falafel salad,  flavors on point,  perfectly seasoned.  Sort of like a falafel sandwich without the bread. Falafels are really not greasy,  ultra crunchy on the outside, and moist on the inside. Delicious tahini based vinaigrette.  Portion is quite generous.  Had the falafel sandwich at their opening party. I am used to eating Arabic style falafel,  but definitely into the Israeli style. The bread was very fresh and lots of delicious topings. Looking forward to trying the othe menu items,  sabich,  zaatar fries etc.. The place is spotless and was jammed packed on a random afternoon.  Friendly staff and quick service even though it was busy."
/user_details?userid=KUzSS0uiCIlQIcJT63pjGw,Carlito B.,"La Salle, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm constantly on the hunt for a good falafel. My quest brought me to Yani. Their falafels are fried to order and delicious. Unlike other place their falafels are smaller making them crunchier. The hummus is tasty and has the right texture. They have Zaatar fries that are to die for. Great little twist on fries. Portions are a little small for the price you pay. But when it's this good, I know I won't be able to resist treating myself to some once in a while."
/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"It's not the Lebanese style falafel sandwich that I'm used to having all the time, although was worth giving it a shot to discover the Israeli version of it. I wasn't impressed much by its overall mild taste but have to say it's still a decent, good quality food. The ingredients inside work well together but lack to deliver a punch or hit than note your taste buds look for. The place is quite new, opened up just 2-3 weeks ago if I'm not mistaken. Nice friendly staff, clean and well maintained normal size for falafel joints. Price wise, about $14 tax in without tips. For a falafel pita sandwich with a 12oz cup of lemonade that I believe is prepared with artificial lemon juice, is a bit pricey for me. Note: They don't carry straws for the lemonade cup. Excuse me?"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little spot for falafel. The prices were good the location was clean and casual , seemed like most people were doing takeout though as opposed to sit down. The falafel was very tasty and all the ingredients were fresh and well put together , and the portion size is very generous. This is definitely one of the better spots in the city for falafel (I still prefer sumac for it BUT Yoni is right behind it in my opinion)."
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"SABICH. SABICH. SABICH. Their sabich sandwich will fill you up and explode your taste buds. Seriously. It was so tasty that my taste buds overloaded and I haven't been able to taste anything since. I should probably see a doctor about it but my RAMQ expired, so I guess I'll just have to spend the next several years not tasting anything and remembering how incredible this sabich sandwich was. Totally worth it."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I live in the neighbourhood, so I've passed this place many times. I finally pulled the trigger and tried a falafel pita. The store front has a really hip 70's vibe. There isn't much seating space. I liked how there was a sink, so if you were eating in there and your hands got dirty, it's ready for you.The pita was quite substantial in size and very very good. I've had falafel a few times and sometimes it's good, sometimes it's too hard or salty. In this case, it was tender on the inside, but crispy on the outside. The pita was also filled with a bunch of fresh vegetables, pickles, and sauce. Very delicious. It cost $8 for a large falafel that kept me full for a few hours."
/user_details?userid=_ShvFNBt5_bJCyTeAdYBlg,Sara L.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"I haven't been this impressed by delivery order for as long as I can remember!! The food is delicious, fresh, unique - there is mint in the falafel salads :) but what I'm most impressed by is the service - since you are forced to choose a drink with your order, we asked for no drinks because we wanted to reduce our waste. So instead of drinks they sent us sweets, with a kind note! So thoughtful and personal touch"
/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",5 star rating,Love this vegetarian friendly restaurant in the mile end. The menu is not extensive but everything I ate was delicious. I recommend getting a half falafel pita and the zataar fries. They were tasty and made with quality ingredients. The service was also great. staff was friendly and readily described the items of the menu. I will definitely be going back.
/user_details?userid=RvrQ8ISZJz9MqpJn8FWMeg,Natalia A.,"QC, Canada",5 star rating,The falafel were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The coleslaw was tangy and the pitas were pillowy. I enjoyed every bite!
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Go here. I went here a few weeks after opening during Friday lunch hour. There were a solid 15 people in line. It moved quickly!There are a very few number of things to choose amongst. But honestly, don't question it....just get the falafel sandwich. Fries a decent as well with a nice seasoning, but you will have too much food so I'd recco splitting this. Disclaimer, if you're not super starved I would only get a half sandwich. Falafel is something that will hit you like a brick in the stomach, and you'll be full for HOURS. In comparison to a shop like green panther, there are approx 3-4 more falafel balls included. Fav thing at Yoni is the La Croix fridge. This buzzy seltzer brand is the BOMB, and really tops off the sandwich. Pricing is super reasonable!! You can get a full sandwich and a La Croix for 11$ The set up is similar to next door lloydies or green panther, in that you order at the counter and then sit down. Would go here for a quick bite, rather than for a big dinner with friends etc."
/user_details?userid=RGCz5-IVUpdaNWRxOJhUww,Matt S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Probably the best falafel I've tried in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=OlId9zCfsfeHoLKp4V0QsQ,Priscilla J.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Rarely do I give a review, but the food was that good! The portions were great, food was presented quick, small uncomplicated menu, and great for vegans/ non-vegans alike. My significant other is Lebanese he he said the food was spot on. Give it a go!!!"
/user_details?userid=uQmZs1JhCV1jRZ4SiCdCTg,Chris C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Succulent, delicious flavours- fresh taste with a nice bit to it. Great for the price. Very nice customer service unlike that of of santropol. We ate this on the park bench in perfect weather. See you next time."
/user_details?userid=VqrO92I_2s52Tp9UzCpSbA,Elaiza S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Favourite falafel in Montreal. We go there Whenever we can since we live in Lachine, but its sooo freaken good. Literally crave it again as soon as we leave. A full pita and some tahini balls are perfect! And the mint lemonade is amazing too! Urgh i love it so much!"
/user_details?userid=uN-R8j0JexLz2AEBYOByIA,Nico L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had been eyeing this place since it opened as I love falafels but always feel underwhelmed by the falafels served by big chains. Also I was told these were Israeli falafels which I doubt I ever had. The menu is comprised of only a few items, falafel being the star of every dish. You can get falafels in a pita, salad or deconstructed on a plate. I got the plate because I wanted to really taste every single item on their own. The falafels were smaller than I was used to (think bite sized) but SO flavourful, well spiced, fresh tasting, full of herbs and freshly fried. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside... to die for! Hence the 4 stars. It's SO rare to find a falafel this good and this fresh out of downtown Montreal. The rest of the stuff on the plate was so so but I appreciated the whole thing as a combination. As much as I love grilled food, I felt like my pita was a bit too charred. All i was tasting was the burnt flavour. I also could've done with less pickled veggies and a bit more of everything else. Portion size was just right. I also got the limonana which was good on its own but I found it to be very tart and strong. A bit overpowering in flavour to drink while eating. My hubs got a pita which he really enjoyed (was a bit messy for my taste). I saw other customers having the salad and it looked phenomenal. That's what I'll be having next time. The place itself is basically a counter. You order and you eat at bar stools. There is a communal sink in the Center of the dining area. It's very casual and laid back."
/user_details?userid=0hGmVexpm4Io2DwPvRUngA,Emily A.,"Delray Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Starving after a long morning of hiking Mont Royal, I already had this place starred on my map. The best falafel I've had in years (maybe ever) and at an excellent price. We were clearly not the only people who had delicious falafel in mind for lunch, as a huge crowd arrived right after we ordered. If you're looking for an excellent and affordable lunch or snack while exploring the Mile End, I highly highly recommend!!!"
/user_details?userid=VKNlkZh-IQ4BjhINh2X1_w,Becky R.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Bite for bite one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Do yourself a favor, order the falafel pita, and immediately order a second one. This place is the TRUTH. The pita bread is to die for. The falafel is perfect. Spice + crunch were juuuust right.  The only thing possibly better than the food was the service. Staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Yoni is a gem of a human being...obviously passionate about his product, an awesome rep of his city, and extraordinarily generous with his time and attention to customers. He spent 15 minutes with us giving us recos to different restaurants + bars throughout the city...the whole experience at Falafel Yoni was an absolute highlight of our trip. We've been back in Chicago for 24 hours and I'm already planning our next visit to Montreal...first stop...Yoni's."
/user_details?userid=EZc6IQtM0UI_uYVomjcJaQ,Pau A.,"Fort Worth, TX",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing ! We had the falafel pita, falafel salad, and eggplant pita. Falafel Yoni are the best falafels I have ever had! They also have this spicy sauce ... if you like spicy it's a must ! If you're not sure then have it on the side but have it!!! I felt fully satisfied with the food and completely happy with the service!"
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I wish this place had a few more items on the menu. However, the few items that actually made it to their menu (basically falafel, hummus and fries) are all executed perfectly. All the sauces and condiments are made in house. Service is rapid. Portions are large. Prices are more than reasonable. Quality is excellent. Montreal really needed a falafel shop like this one. Their falafel is so tasty I am actually getting a craving as I write this review :)"
/user_details?userid=012KRHIrKQGAHEMrn6aZgA,Lena F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best falafel sandwich I've ever had! Great place for a quick bite! Healthy, tasty & filling!"
/user_details?userid=DUO3m2YWfFvDDISabbrdFA,Abe S.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,I went there to try their falafel sandwich in a pita. I found it very good. The falafel was a little crispy on the outside and moist on the inside (good texture). The spice and sea songs as well as the salad inside the sand which was very good. One sandwich is a complete meal. They also offer a half sandwich which is a great idea because a whole sandwich might be too big for some people. I definitely recommend it.
/user_details?userid=niPVQFKVX_Kh1sFFUPJdjA,Leo F.,"Vernon Hills, IL",5 star rating,"Found this place while on the business trip. Every single dish I tried was absolutely stellar. Falafel, shawarma, you name it are cooked to perfection.   The staff is very friendly and general atmosphere is very conducive for a nice middle eastern meal."
