Service was quick, food was really good and comforting; just what I was looking for on a cold day! Will definitely come back. Must try!"

I haven't tried everything here but I like popping in for a quick sandwich and a mellow break from the Mile End. I've found the service fairly quick and friendly. At $10 the sandwich with fries and a drink is a great option for lunch in the area."
