The coffee is amazing and they also have great snacks for take out or to eat at their cute terrasse. It's my first time in 3 months that I go there and I just noticed that they have a new addition: they are going to have a small local items: vegetables and local brands foods and beverages offering. A kind of small market. Great idea!!"

Going back tomorrow, hopefully they are still open.."
/user_details?userid=MDrF3ely3EoEJbUIl3Ey2Q,Ayesha N.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"OMG  This Café is amazing!!! One day we didn't make it in time and they sold out of this delicious bacon egg and cheese on a pastry dough. It caused an uproar within my family for not getting up earlier. We tried another dish and wow they did not disappoint. Check out their back patio. Wake up early, bring a book  and start your day here, you'll be off to a great day!"
/user_details?userid=7N4k5ASueockicrHl-A_SA,Orenvungi N.,"Sandy Hill, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I accidentally discovered La Finca while searching for a brunch spot near the hotel I was staying. This cute cafe has a a minimal but very chic and urban decor, and if you need a place to get some studying or work done, this is the place to be. They have a great breakfast menu from eggs, sandwich, granola to croissants, and so much more!I got the shrimp Tartine with a cup of almond cappuccino and I just have to say that it was such a hearty and comforting brunch even though I was all by myself. I loved the rich and bold flavour of the cappuccino, literally one of the best I've tried. The Shrimp Tartine is an open faced sandwich that's artfully presented, and a a lot bigger than what I was expecting- large slice of whole wheat bread with a generous spread of avocado parsley pesto and alfalfa, then topped with creamy mayo shrimp , radish & red endive. A simple yet very flavourful combination of ingredients. The staff were super friendly, and service was very quick, and I also really loved their open kitchen concept. If you ever find yourself in downtown Montreal, La Finca is definitely a must visit."
/user_details?userid=op8d9geoz8oeBseVAqiPNg,Veronica Y.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,Cute little homey cafe that would also be a great place to work! It looked like the had some tables that could be sort of sectioned off if you even wanted to have a small meeting here. Great selection of little pastries that seem fairly unique (I only visited Montreal for a conference for a few days so I can't say I know the food layout well).
/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"Four of us were lucky enough to have scored an Airbnb right around the corner from this fantastic cafe.  We loved it so much we came for three out of our four mornings in Montreal.  I cannot recommend it enough if you want perfect tea, coffee, pastries and the world's most perfect breakfast EVER!...the Breakfast Danish is flaky square puff pastry with an egg that's delicately cooked. It oozes open and there's just the right amount of cheese, bacon and tomato under.  Words cannot express how perfect and wonderful it is.  (see pic!!)I also can attest to a perfect chocolate croissant, and the one bite I got of Husband's phenomenal Grilled Cheese w/what must have been sauteed leeks.  So rich and delicious. Others liked their Granola w/fruit and yogurt so much that they got it every time.  Coffees are perfect, as are the pots of tea.It's not a big place, but we only ran into seating problems one time, but still managed to find room at the window.  Otherwise there are a few tables for four and a communal table.  LOVED that they say no laptops on the tables for four, to maximize seating potential.Order at the counter, pay, find a seat and get ready for the most perfect way to start the day!"
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Little cute and clean coffee shop in the Square-Victoria area.  You can actually rent their room to have meetings or group work. Very nice for students. The match latte is a bit flat, not that tasty.  The yogurt granola is not made with fresh fruit, so another minus for this.  The staffs are very nice"
/user_details?userid=syCxRdiP-0XJenWpJ8L02g,Cindy L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Discovered La Finca while looking for good coffee spots near the hotel I was staying at. This cafe is walking distance from Hotel Le Dauphin and it is definitely worth checking out! Morning's can get crowded but if you're lucky enough, there is a decent amount of seating here. The reviews here are on point and accurate unlike some of the places I have been to. I highly recommend this coffee shop!This is a cute and quaint cafe with indoor and a small outdoors seating (patio) which gives off a bohemian vibe.  Sure, you can take a couple of 'Instagram' worthy photos while you're here too! It is very relaxing here especially in the mornings, it is perfect with a cup of coffee and food for sharing.I shared the Grilled Cheese with my boyfriend and it was so 'rich' in flavours but I mean this in the best way possible. It was SO GOOD! I did not have the chance to try out the other items on the menu but this grilled cheese paired perfectly with a coffee or 'latte' in my case. I visited La Finca twice and both times ordered the soy latte. My boyfriend ordered the matcha soy latte but prefers the soy latte in comparison.  Overall, prices here are reasonable for the quality you are getting and service here is so friendly (they speak English and French). The vibes here brightened my day especially in the morning, since I am not a morning person. It is definitely a breath of fresh air in the mist of so many cafes. Keep it simple but doing it right - I'll be back La Finca."

This place has been on my list for quite some time and I am glad I made it! I had their latte and brownie. The latte was good. As for the brownie, wish it was more fresh as it was on the harder side.. The staff was extremely friendly and kind.It does get packed around lunch time so be prepared to share your space.PS: they have boardrooms available for rent on an hourly basis."
/user_details?userid=wdeWt5VqTW26PAeQsVg73g,Ada L.,"North York, Canada",4 star rating,"La Finca is a coffee shop located in downtown Montreal. It has a simple, Scandinavian vibe to it with simplistic décor and a welcoming vibe. My friends and I dropped by La Finca a couple of times during our stay in Montreal as it was close to our accommodations. The café serves a variety of coffee/tea beverages, savory food items (like sandwiches), and baked goods.  The service was always friendly and attentive. We even asked the staff for a candle we had a birthday to celebrate. Would definitely go back to La Finca if I were ever back in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,La Finca is a downtown cafe brewing really good coffee in chic digs. It's spacious for a cafe with a large front dining area and several smaller rooms well decorated with white brick walls and hanging plants in the back. In the way way back is an outdoor patio with more chairs and tables. My latte was well brewed and balanced. One of the best cups I had in Montreal!
/user_details?userid=pbvHa5ATrfRTdAg0dIa0MA,Mary G.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Great gem in downtown Montreal. Extremely limited seating was the downside here. Cold brew wasn't bad, but just mediocre. I had to get the pb&j because they told me they couldn't make egg sandwich without bacon, thought that was odd. The homemade pb was my favorite and I sat in the back area relaxing, taking in my alone time before a hectic weekend. Would like more variation to menu and hopefully they get rid of the conference room since they could easily fit 10 more tables back there. Not sure what that is for, but seemed pointless to me."
/user_details?userid=teYpKMlVjDvM8QsyURChLQ,Stephanie L.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,I came across this cute cafe on a Friday after work when I needed a pause from the craziness of the week and the city. The decor is classic Montreal hipster/bohemian which I love and makes for a calming atmosphere. I enjoyed a croissant and iced tea. Not sure what they put in their concoction of iced tea but it was incredibly fragrant and tasty. I would definitely go back just for another! I also liked that this was place you could work from and rent out office space. We need more combined spaces like this in ever city. If you're downtown check out this place when you need a quick break.
/user_details?userid=D8oxPnX68HgxROGOxZL1SQ,Carol H.,"Norwell, MA",5 star rating,"They make amazing croissant, probably one of the best I've had.  Right amount of flakiness and layered, and it was slightly warm when they served it.  Latte was delicious too. We stayed it Montréal for 2 days and had breakfast there 2 days in a row. They also have nice outdoor seating in the rear."

They made them old school one at a time using great beans and turned out having amazing flavour.  While I was at the cafe I ended up dropping cash on the floor which was honestly and graciously returned to me several hours later. I will most definitely make this a go to place and would recommend to everyone else! Thank you again Cafe La Finca"
/user_details?userid=JNo2q1W5dvc62XP41m_KMQ,Beth H.,"Omaha, NE",5 star rating,"Went in shortly after opening during the weekday and has a great experience. The service was attentive and personable. I had a latte with some fun art on it, a fresh squeezed orange juice, and a savory breakfast pastry. Coffee had a nice roast-y/toasty flavor and the breakfast pastry had moments of brightness in the savory due to some (pickled?) onions. I'd go back."

/user_details?userid=zV3PESBiRxRHODli1ZlHww,Aline T.,"CA, CA",5 star rating,"Amazing little place we stopped for our last breakfast in Montreal! It's absolutely adorable inside with plenty of e seating in different settings, but we sat at the bar and watched the croissants get made. Get the croissant. You won't regret it.

/user_details?userid=87vBjQWvGBd57r4tGpu0lQ,Jason A.,"Guntersville, AL",5 star rating,"Very good spot.  I found this on my first morning in Montreal and ordered the breakfast danish (pastry with ham, sunny side up egg, cheese, etc) with a chai latte.  Both were really good and before left for the airport on my last morning I walked back down to get another danish and latte along with a chocolate croissant - very good as well.  Great little spot I would recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=-Ds0hzlQwZUukmOwnapaFg,Cassie M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"Sad because they were out of breakfast sandwiches, but their grilled cheese is to die for. Cold brew coffee was delicious and their service is fast and friendly. I would come back here"
/user_details?userid=ekxudVSy1O66mk4d0BYs3g,Jordan R.,"Denver, CO",4 star rating,"The cutest little cafe near the convention center. I stumbled upon this airy and bright cafe and went back every morning. Super friendly staff and lots of seating. The coffee is solid, with espresso based drinks being my favorite here. I had the latte and the cappuccino and both were delicious and rich. The food was also a good surprise. I tried the banana/peanut butter toast, the chocolatine (chocolate croissant), and a flour-less chocolate brownie. The croissant was the best I had during my trip to Montreal and I'd go back for that alone. The only disappointment was the chai latte. The taste was very off putting and I dumped it after two sips. I think it had to do with the tea mix, but I have never had a worse chai. I'd definitely come back for the ambiance, the baked goods, and the espresso but be weary of the chai."

Our organization  reserved the large meeting room for writing retreats and the room is beautiful, cozy, and the prices  are more than fair.In addition to the meeting rooms, we  have to say the end of year party we had at Finca was amazing!!! The space was beautiful and perfectly suited our 40 person event. The event planner and staff worked with us to make an event work within our budget. The food the was prepared in-house was amazing and our guests were really happy. Thank you for allowing us to have our event in your beautiful space- we look forward to doing it again next year!"
/user_details?userid=eBvfAlfd95KASp8UQdNCpg,Tifani B.,"Newark, DE",5 star rating,Can I just say that I visited Montréal during a blizzard and La Finca is the only this that kept me alive spiritually during those days. Please try their espresso and literally anything they make related to a croissant. It was so fabulous and I am absolutely hungry for more.
/user_details?userid=iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I figured we couldn't go to Montreal without hitting at least one funky, trendy coffee shop and La Finca kept popping up as a recommendation. It was no less than John Catucci who finally convinced us that yes, we must try this place out.It's a very cool and friendly little establishment. The folks behind the counter were extremely friendly and approachable, and, though I don't drink coffee, I'm told their brew is above average.I knew going in that I absolutely had to get the Cucumber Tartine, as I'd seen pictures of it and it looked incredible.It is.For one thing, it's bigger than I was expecting. This is a fairly monstrous open-faced sandwich that's covered in artfully-prepared and presented cucumbers. They're lying on a bed of ricotta and the tartine also includes nuts and onions. It's a very simple yet very flavorful concoction, and had there been a patio, I know I would've enjoyed taking my time eating it in the fresh air. (The interior is very open and bright, at least.)"
/user_details?userid=1b8XBE_Wtwb4qgOps6AVKA,Christina K.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"La Finca is a charming breath of fresh air - clean lines, light and airy open space with sprinkles of Etsy-like charm throughout. I was immediately drawn in and took a deep breath as that is naturally what one wants to do when you walk in.  The tables were packed with guests working on laptops and holding meetings so graciously, La Finca added a two seat spot at the counter for soloists like me to enjoy my coffee ""ici.""  The menu was filled with all of the delicious things one craves in the morning from a delicious looking breakfast sandwich on a croissant to a tempting apple turnover.  Unfortunately, by 11am on a Wednesday they were sold out of the baguette petit du jenuer (I know I spelled that wrong! Ha!!) so I passed on the food but what I watched come out of the tiny kitchen was mouthwatering.The coffee menu was as charming as a Grand Central Station schedule board with all of the traditional offerings plus a few that confirm I made the right choice...things like a Cortado are included, grande-sized cappuccinos are not.  Given this is Montreal and not a Starbucks or America, for that matter, alternative milk choices were not readily available.  Regardless, the traditional cortado they made me had the most perfectly paint-like steamed milk and the coffee notes of caramel and chocolate.  Delicious!I would highly recommend finding time to stop in when you can take a minute for yourself and appreciate life's little pleasures: pleasant staff, revitalizing environment, and nourishing food and beverages that are equally as delicious."

It's so quiet here (though it's getting busier now more people know about it) and you can book a meeting room if you want guaranteed seating (which costs a small fee). The tea comes in big teapots so you get great value for your money, and the selection of food they have is fresh, healthy and delicious. The wifi is really good too ;)"

I also enjoy having a snack when I'm there and I've attached a picture of my go-to. It has an egg, ham and cheese on a flaky pastry. They do run out, so it's best to come early!"

It is simply beautiful, clean and inviting. Both my sister and I order café americano and it was simply delicious! It was bold without being overpowering. She ordered the grilled cheese which was in her words perfection. The perfect amount of cheese and butter. I order a danish with an egg, prosciutto, and tomato....wow! The danish was warm and crusty and the yolk was not over cooked so it melted with the other ingredients. Great soothing ambiance and soft music. Perfect for the weather"
/user_details?userid=bJdydVeS9ZP9eUqPEI8KZg,Lauren F.,"West Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,This is possibly the most adorable cafe I've ever seen. The decor & atmosphere were bright and cheery. When I got there there wasn't many places to sit. The cashier suggested I sit on the stacked benches & they were so comfy I stayed there even though some tables opened up. The croissant was huge & fluffy. The chai latte was great with just the right amount of spice. I usually order it from Starbucks and in my opinion La Finca is better. It was worth the 10min walk to get there.
/user_details?userid=HMUnp55Q8_vxIEPl1V0W_g,Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Excellent coffee house.Technically this is a ""shared office space"" so if you want to pay $10 an hour, you can rent a conference room with a projector and a big table.Almost no one was taking them up on the deal when I was there.Mostly it was an orthodox coffee house with a third of the customers working on line and the rest involved in groups in animated conversation.(Being near the convention center increases the talkers and decreases the home-workers.)The coffee is OUTSTANDING.Net of a good base product, they have a number of high price ou-la-la brews that use elaborate technologies.(Beakers like something out of high school chemistry class - obscure vintages from deepest darkest wherever.)I would say fewer than 20% of places that offer ""expensive whiz-bang coffee"" have a product that justifies the price.Here the Chemex top of the line brew really IS that good and really DOES justify the price.Add a nice workplace, a young nerdy crowd and nice scenery on both the front and back viewsAnd you have a first rate place to settle down to get some work done."
/user_details?userid=aR7F6JaHjsYW_j5Biih0rQ,Eric B.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,"This is one of the best coffee shops I've been to worldwide. It's in a very tastefully modern meets retro space. There is a small outside space in the back of the shop and small private meeting rooms in addition to a nice open space with a great vibe. But never mind the tasteful and hip space. The lattes rock and the scratch made pastries are even better. If you find yourself in Montreal, arena coffee aficionado and are anywhere near La Finca, you must go!"
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Very cute, minimal cafe. The coffee is alright. I also had the cucumber tartine. Cucumber, nuts and onion topping over a spread of ricotta cheese on toast. The taste was refreshing and 5/5 for presentation."
/user_details?userid=W5p-53T_Om86O01fK5psJg,Kim N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Second stop during la fête des croissants. I immediately liked the vibe of the place as I walked in. High ceiling, exposed brick wall, hanging plant, open kitchen, and relaxed minimalistic decor. Service was very friendly and attentive. They have various baked goods and sandwiches, but I went straight for the croissant. This one didn't disappoint. Hot off the press, the croissant had a crispy exterior and velvety thick layers. It was so buttery I overheard a gentleman on another table exclaim that there must be cheese in it. I debated getting another one to-go, but felt it best to leave on a high :)The coffee looks good too, if their latte art is anything to go by. There will be a next time!"

Aside from the coffee, this place is a great place to study (which I did), or just chill. They have a stair area where you can just relax/read a book, office spaces and pretty good wifi as well. They offer some food items, and I heard they make there own delicious chocolate which I plan on getting next time. Definitely planning on coming here more often!"

/user_details?userid=XpDuMc3nPirq9Gb8MQihgQ,Vincent D.,"Rockville Centre, NY",5 star rating,I decided for a quick breakfast at a local cafe and found La Finca. Modern setting interior with steps in an area that you can sit on levels instead of a tables. Service is attentive and quick. Food is unique and delicious. They have private rooms as well as a small outdoor deck in the back. I had the grilled cheese with mushrooms-awesome. Hanging on the deck on a nice day is a great break from the hectic outside world.
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"La Finca is a charming space located in the region next to Chinatown between downtown Montreal and Old Port. It operates like many other workspaces where you can rent a room (comes with coffee for all) for $20 an hour. The rooms for rent are located in the back of the cafe with bright lighting and an open space with large tables. The other space at Finca is much smaller and more cramped. There is bar seating at the windows, a long table and quite a few smaller tables. It can get quite cold because despite the curtains they put up near the entrance so bundle up if you plan on staying for a few hours. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the cafe space was BUSY. There were people coming in constantly. The prices for La Finca are average for a cafe. The croissant I had was buttery and crisp which was ideal however the London Fog I was served was luke warm. At one point, I was studying with a laptop with 3 other friends and sharing 2 tables between us. The server kindly asked us to share one table instead. While I understand that it is busy and potentially possible to fit 4 people around a circular table enjoying a cup of coffee, it was not possible for four people working on laptops to take one tiny circular table so my friends had to work with their laptops on their lap. I understand there is a space squeeze in a small cafe but La Finca should reconsider their room policy considering there were 3 huge empty tables in the back that people could work at. Especially on a weekend when it is unlikely for work-mates to rent rooms in groups and most individuals are working alone. I would maybe come back when it was less busy but for now, I would avoid La Finca at peak times as you may not get enough space to do your work."

/user_details?userid=XkVLdwv3pLOyXJjHVz1SdQ,Kelley K.,"Springfield, VA",5 star rating,"Love! What an adorable cafe located in downtown Montreal. The decor is something you'd expect to see in Silicon Valley California, super chic and urban.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable of their coffees and food items and have something we've never had before- The Buttercino.  Taken from the Aussies don't let the ""butter"" deter you from trying this delicious and filling beverage.  Known to curb hunger and maintain your energy through the day the Buttercino is a delightful way to warm you up from the outdoors and satiate your taste buds. Enjoy alone or with one of their amazing pastries. The apple turnover and chocolate Croissant were absolute perfection and their flaky layers of pure goodness can not be understated.  5 stars for this coffee house based on stellar customer service, tasty coffees, fresh foods and ambience."

I love how la Finca offers isolated workspaces for people to work quietly. The café has beautiful decor and provides a great ambiance for studying, working and relaxing. The staff there is also very friendly and the service is quick. I didn't try any of their food, but when I looked at other people having lunch there, seemingly they offer quite a variety of light lunches that are very appetizing. The coffee is good and not expensive, I loved this place so much!"

Great tasting coffee, sunny spaces to work or chat with friends and a decent but small menu if you wander in and are feeling munchy. The back deck is a bit small, so get there early if you want to claim a spot. The little work/meeting rooms are also hot spots - but totally worth the time to get one to hang out on.Only issue perhaps is the price of coffee. Not cheap! If you are a princess about your coffee though (looking at you, Aussies!), you will probably really like the beans they use and they way they draw a proper cappuccino."

Everything in the granola was toasted which augmented the flavours. The sandwhich was very tastey and loaded with peanut butter and jam. Everything here is made fresh on the spot and in house.

My wife ordered the big bowl of yogurt and granola. Delicious. Service is friendly and helped me to fumble through my attempt at high school French.

They have 2 rooms where you can meet groups for meetings or study sessions, you pay by the hour but get unlimited coffee. The coffee is good and you feel like the owners are very knowledgable about what they offer. The food is all made in house and with the best of ingredients. My favourites are the yoghurt and granola or the PB toast. Husband loves his buttered chicken wrap. My only criticism? It can get a bit chilly in winter but I only notice it after I've spent hours studying in there."
