It was loaded with meat, the fries were still good after a 30 minute commute home, and the curds were perfect. The portion itself was also pretty hefty and sharing it with the boyfriend left me full before bed. The establishment isn't much to look at, but the food is good."
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The poutines here are the bomb! I think this spot has one of the best poutines you can get in Montreal, it's in my top 5! There is something about their fries that tastes almost kind of sweet in every poutine, but not overly powerful. It's unlike many other poutineries in my opinion.It's a small spot though and I wouldn't recommend a big group. But you can swing in and order to go, they're very fast. The prices are also excellent for a big poutine as good as this in my opinion.The menu is pretty large, they have many different poutines. My favorite is the New York poutine which comes with onions, mushrooms, and ground beef. Their smoked beef poutine is also great. They also serve other things like burgers and pogos, the pogo I had was pretty good!The service has also been very nice every time I've gone. The only downside is that it can get a little crowded in the evening, but the upside is that this is one of the only spots around this area that stays open pretty late! That gets bonus points from me, since I love some late night poutine on a weekend evening."

Im végétarien and is hard to find a place who have option for me and my boyfriend (eat meat),where we can enjoy both. The vegan sauce was really good, the potatoes where thick and crispy and the cheese was a good texture. I went September 2020, with the virus they still give a good service. For sure im coming back."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Banquise had a huge line so we went to Chez Claudette. This is a no frills casse-croûte that serves delicious poutine and all the regular fast food items that you can think of. I really.loved their poutine because their fries were crunchy, gravy was thick and well spiced and it had a good serving of fresh cheese curds.They have a pretty extensive list of poutines so we chose 5 and shared. My favourite was the smoked meat poutine. The flavors of the gravy and smoked meat went really well together and I find it represents Montreal pretty well too. A close second was the ""trois S""- Three types of Italian sausages.  Chez Claudette is just as good as Banquise. I'll definitely be back!"

/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"I think it's hard to judge a place solely off its poutine. For me, the poutine has the meaty beef flavour with the herb notes, the crispy fries and the squeaky cheese. Individually, all the components are there. Somehow, it doesn't quite all come together in as harmonious dish. It may be due to the extra starchy potatoes giving the dish an unexpected sweetness or the meaty gravy that adds a heaviness to the dish. The service leaves much to be desired. There are definitely better spots for poutine so I'd opt for skipping this one for some better options."
/user_details?userid=PfSl2dwE5djHHTHuCjlI1w,Samantha M.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Pros: Famous spot, been on tv, great poutine (lots of variety, great flavours, etc...)friendly service, great prices and generous portion sizesCons: Not in my city!My friend and I took a trip to Montreal for the day, and naturally we wanted to enjoy some of the traditional Quebec treats. She wanted smoked meat, I wanted poutine...I won! Luckily for her, the food was so tasty so it kind of counts as a win for both of us.Upon first glance, you might get the wrong impression about this place. It's not super fancy or spacious, and one might think of it as a bit of a dive. Let me tell you, do NOT judge this book by its cover.The service, while a little slow (its worth the wait, I promise) is super friendly. The menu offers a huge selection of poutine options so, literally, there's something for everyone! Not to mention, for 2 poutines and a burger (plus tip) lunch for my friend and I came out to less than $25. And the portions were huge. Seriously- get the small!I ordered the ""cabane"" poutine. Take your traditional poutine with cheese curds and amazingly seasoned gravy...then add, maple syrup, baked beans, bacon, ham, and sausage. Yup... I will be working that off all week at the gym, but I have zero regrets.Once you factor in the ""cool"" factor of checking out another place on the ""you gotta eat here"" list (I'm assuming I'm not the only one that watches the food network and then missions to try as many places as possible...can I?) there really aren't many reasons to avoid checking this place out.If you're still on the fence, give it a shot. Worst case scenario you fall in love with their food and live in a different province. Like me."

We were just walking on the Laurier street; the first restaurant that we spot was Chez Claudette. When we entered, it was a tiny diner. I won't say it is the most cleanest place. We took a table by the entrance. The service was superb. Our waitress was sweet, friendly and very quick. The menu has lot varieties of breakfast and comfort food. I decided to take a risk, so I ordered chicken tandoori poutine. I won't lie about it...it was really good. Fries, curd cheese, chicken tandoori, caramelized onion, and tandoori sauce made this dish really special. My friend decided to take a breakfast plate with omelette, with potatoes and bread. The kitchen was nearby, so the noise of the clanking of dishes were very loud and disrupting. But we did stay there about two hours... just talking. I really enjoyed that nice diner."

/user_details?userid=MotpUUjtHNK7N3FQENYJ2w,Katie F.,"Whitby, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing poutine! We've been to many poutineries and this is one of our favourites! Generous size, thick gravy, delicious fries. Service was fast and friendly, prices are great, looks more like local's place not a tourist trap. We had smoked meat poutine and 3 sausage poutine- delicious! We could barely finish our ""small"" size meals. The only down side (is it though?) is that menu is in French only but with help of a waiter and yelp reviews it's not that big of a problem. Absolutely in love and from now on my favourite place in Montreal. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is trying poutine for the fist time or on the hunt for the perfect poutine."

A very welcoming dinner style place that makes youbfeel at home and the bonus cool VEGETERIAN options (burger, hot d9g sandwich, poutine and ofcourse saldes). This is a place every one can find some to eat( meat lovers to vegans) and the price ranges from thats very reasonable to cool this is cheap.I've been here over the weekend and the place was both packed and understaffed which effected my expirience (therefore not a solid 5).

I LIKE my late night poutine so I am super picky. I think that Chez Claudette is fine but by far from my favorite joint for late night poutine. I would say it is a good option late without a long wait. I tried the ""Baton"" poutine with a cut up pogo and it was ok. My favorite is the traditional and the mushroom and pepper poutine. Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=fqYKF47lEQDfg6i--ndSUg,Ya M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I was in a rush this evening so I telephoned the restaurant 20 minutes in advance and ask them to prepare me in order. They said no problem. When I arrived to pick up my meal the waitress said ah your the guy that called and then decided to punch in my order at that moment. While I was waiting I questioned the cook and he told me that they do not take telephone orders. I asked him why I was not told that when I place my order over the phone. He told me that you can't say that to a client. So he prefers to lie to the client give them a false impression that they're saving time make them late for work and be dishonest is the better approach towards the client. On top of that they did not put my drink in with my trio so I got ripped off on top of being insulted and late for work. Poutine was soggy and the hamburger bun also.
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down the tastiest poutine and all-dressed steamie in the city. I love it.POUTINEFinally, a poutine with fresh tasting fries that are not dry and a gravy that is not only gentle on salt but quite tasty as well. I like mushy fries with minimal crisp with a melting potato sweet and fresh oil taste - Claudette's fries are a perfect reference! The gravy really stood out with a blend of garlic and peppery flavours with a controlled salt level so you can taste everything else. I ordered an American poutine which added sautéd mushroom, bell peppers, and ""New York"" steak. I really liked the sautéd mushroom which added a nice texture and a bit of stir-fry burnt to the poutine. The steak didn't add much value but it was big and not saltier than the other stuff so blended in well.Overall, being easy on the salt AND showcasing great flavours is an achievement. You might be suspicious at first of the endless choice of poutines à la Banquise, but what I took today proved that fancier can be done right.STEAMIE (hot dog)The all-dressed steamie at Claudette proved that you could improve such a basic thing as a hot dog by adding more relish than mustard and mince-chopped garlic coleslaw instead of the more thick-cut intertwined choux (Green Spot style). The result is a surprisingly tasty dish that doesn't saturate your taste buds with pure mustard and that is easy to eat - it's the least messy hot dog I've eaten.I used to be settled on the ""traditional"" Montreal all-dressed steamie, i.e. only mustard, chopped onion (large cubed) and choux. Having toured big names like Décarie Hot Dog, Green Spot, R Lafleur, La Belle Province, and Alfa, some of which deviate from the traditional style, proved that different wasn't better than traditional so I vouched for the latter. The all-dressed steamie at Chez Claudette though is a large enough improvement that I think is innovative and  worthy of parting from traditions.I LOVE IT BECAUSENone come close in terms of taste. Tbh I never expected a steamie-the most basic of commodities-could be much different from what I was used to, and didn't expect that a dressed-up poutine can be humble enough to be more than a random pilling up of ingredients.Chez Claudette also serves all-day breakfast, Boréale bottles of beer @ $5, is open 24H several days a week, and has a small outdoor terrasse. Takes debit and credit.5 stars and hope it stays true for years to come."

I got there and they have a lot of options for poutine. Took me a long time to decide which one to take but I finally settled on the pharaon. I received the poutine and first thing I liked was that the cheese was melted. Too often with poutine they dump the cheese and it doesn't even melt. Another thing I really liked with this one was the peppers.  The added  a little spicy taste but not overwhelming. Overall a good poutine.  Now I'll have to go back to try the other flavors."

/user_details?userid=a3wFMZ1FPYgGHTzppxiVgQ,Alexandra G.,"Dallas, TX",1 star rating,Menu with cheap / low quality food; essentially charging you for stuff you can buy pre-made at a grocery store. Got food poising within 3 hours of eating the pogo and poutine here. Something about their French fries also tasted off--so who knows if they are just using spoiled produce. Little English spoken and the guy pretty much forced us to tip after he just stopped attending to us after we got our food. Not impressed.
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the Montreal classic Poutine joints up there with patati patata and la banquise. Great fries, great cheese (and lots of it!). Personally, the gravy leaves a bit to be desired, but it may just be a personal preference! Definitely worth checking off your Montréal bucket list.If you are genuinely hoping to get a Poutine fix, this may very well be a go-to for you as the lineup is not an issue, and service is quick in comparison to other ""celeb status"" poutines.

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Been here twice and won't be back anytime soon.On the first time, I ordered their braised pork poutine, which is essentially crockpot pork in a pepper gravy. The cubes of pork were tough, dry, and tasteless (it didnt even taste like pork). The accompanying gravy was kind of spicy due to the black peppers. The fries were the typical french quebecois fries - deep fried but still somewhat mushy, and not crispy. Second time around, I decided to give their original gravy a go, so I ordered the classic poutine...it was not exceptional in flavor despite what some claim. What I can conclude is that they're really greedy on the cheese curds. Both times I went, I've been given small quantities of cheese on my poutines such that I started with a poutine and was left with half a 'frite sauce', and I don't even like cheese (wait waaaat how can you -- I'm not a baby cow).Their steamie, on the other hand, is very balanced in taste, for a Montreal-style steamie (ie: not a sauerkraut dog). Service was probably the worst I've experienced at a casse croute. Cashier kept a straight face all along (not a single smile or thanks), and cooks looked fed up with their job. Price/quantity wise, it's more expensive than Decarie Hot Dog, but cheaper than Orange Julep."

Settled for a hotdog and poutine combo for $7 (that is two hotdogs and a small poutine). It filled the hole but was not enjoyable. Heck, if I am going to sacrifice minutes of my life to a heap of gravy and fries it should at least be enjoyable! For what's open late at night, and for cheap, it will have to do."

Diner style, greasy spoony type of restaurant, this place is open early and closes late enough. It doesn't even close all weekend. Where chez Claudette apparently really shines is with their choices of poutines. My colleagues and I went there for lunch and I had the smoked meat poutine. Let's just say that I should have had the American poutine with steak, mushrooms and peppers that my colleague ordered. The fries were homemade and crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside, the gravy was ok and the cheese were melted enough but the smoked meat fell short. I'd say it was ""meh!"". Breakfast options are great and reasonably priced. You can get some eggs and sausages or bacon for around 5$. Overall, don't expect the fanciest meal but it's definitely good enough for the price."

But kinda gross?Let me tell you...I just about fell out of my chair when I found out my office was right near a poutine place that appeared on the TV show ""You Gotta Eat Here"". I thought that this place would be a show stopper considering it's located in the poutine capital of the world! Right?! WRONG. On both of my visits, I've been utterly disappointed. First I tried the Italian poutine. This is my favorite type of poutine. It usually has a finely ground Italian spaghetti style sauce covering salty crispy fries with cheese curds. Well what I was served was not that at all. Chunky chunk chunky sauce big fat unbroken pieces of ground beef, canned tomatoes & quarter onion slices. All of the veggies were grossly under cooked. It had zero flavor and zero salt. Needless to say I ate a few bites reluctantly paid, and left.I went in a second and final time thinking they may just have a godawful Italian poutine but given it's ample selection to choose from, I'll try something else. I got a regular poutine because who can screw that up, along with a burger and a drink. This time it was worse... the burger patties are frozen store bought and tasted like old cardboard, the fries were again flavourless and unsalted and the gravy was a cold, snotty, tasteless mess. The only thing I'll give them ""kudos"" for is the pricing & service. If you want a cheap cheap tasteless poutine and friendly-ish waitresses, this is a good spot in the Plateau area. None the less, I recommend passing on this one. I have no idea how they get so many good reviews so I sincerely hope Im wrong and got them on a bad day (or two).

/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Nothing special about it. I dont know how it got on ""You gotta eat here"". It's nothing different from La Banquise. If anything I think it might be worst, I just dont understand how it got on a FoodNetwork show. I was expecting so much because it was on the show that is why I am being so harsh. I didnt like the sauce and the service was horrible. Waitress did not even acknowledge our existence. Would not recommend and would not go back"
/user_details?userid=O8o65uIrioLYghwijHhfyQ,Thomas R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Chez Claudette. What can I say? Montreal would practically not exist without it. I mean this literally. See, a couple years ago a terrible earthquake struck this gorgeous city, splitting it head from toe. Strangely enough, the fault lines ran perfectly through each poutine shop in Montreal, gem of Quebec. The only shop standing? Chez Claudette. Give them a big round of applause, please."
/user_details?userid=0xyal1lbo7EiPs0s29k8Lw,Jon W.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Perfect for a late night meal! The staff is friendly and the price is right! I've been known to frequent the place on late nights, i prefer it over the Banquise even if i'm across the street from it.. Its probably due to the huge line up the food is ok but the staff is half and half (i assume they are annoyed of the young drunks) Anyways all to say its my new spot for a late night meal they have a variety of food and even a terrace in the summer."
/user_details?userid=rYLFksli7mXB0MZxo3MHOw,Eric L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a bit of an institution and I usually come here when I have a poutine craving. The poutine here and at the Banquise are quite similar and both are excellent, but my preference for Chez Claudette is due to shorter lineups and they accept credit cards. I think Banquise might have a bit more selection in the type of poutines but Chez Claudette has quite a variety in selection so there is bound to be something for everybody's taste."

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Have eaten here twice now.  Second trip was deliberately to eat the same thing again, to see if the first time was a fluke or not.  Had the poutine with hot dogs trio, both times.The Good:  Excellent fries, properly *fine* minced onion on the hot dogs, best poutine sauce I've ever tasted, decent portion size.The Meh:  Sauce and fries too cold to melt the cheese even a bit (both times);  very lackadaisical, unalert waitress (both times).The Bad:  (1) Hot and cold running cell phone assholes piling up at the counter for take-out, all yakking up independent one-way storms while their fries got blanched.   Both times. I mean, shut the fuck up, will ya?  I'm tryin' to read Photo Police here! And (2) THE RESTROOMS SMELLED  LIKE ASS!!  Okay, that's maybe a bit understated.  They smelled like actual sewage.Both times.Verdict:  It might be a pattern."
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Nothing special. Probably 4 stars if you're drunk late at night. Funny how that improves just about any restaurant. If you're a tourist looking to try a classic Quebec poutine you should look elsewhere for the magical experience.
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Quite surprised to find a lot of upset reviews about Chez Claudette, my neighbourhood greasy spoon. Although I can`t comment on what dining there is like because I always grab my poutine to go, I can tell you that this is one of the hardest working restaurants in Montreal. Not only are they open 24 hours over the weekend, but they're also open on stat holidays. Makes me suspect that the owner is Chinese, though the menu is 100% québecois. Their classic poutine is consistently good. Those fries really stand out - noticeably sweet the way I like it - which balance well with the salty gravy. Their guédille au poulet also deserves a mention and accompanies the poutine well if you need a little protein punch to your meal. The only `meh` factor is that one of their waitresses always has this sour look on her face. She`d say bonjour to me, but coldly, and unfortunately she's always there whenever I have a poutine craving. Hope she retires soon."
/user_details?userid=_xgxMsX2f99Cgzy009Y_lg,Irwin K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"What to say about Claudette's -- it's open late, well that's it. Oh yeah some people love this place (young and usually drunk) and some people don't (sober). I've been there twice and the food was not bad for 3am. The poutine is big, the fries were good but the sauce was cold, cold poutine sauce??? That may just shutdown a place, the two diners on St Denis and Mont-Royal can give you a poutine in minutes with piping hot, tasty sauce which melts the cheese. Don't know if I will be back for more in 2012...??? Dun dun duhhh!!"

/user_details?userid=foC7W9iCzvopo9LVLFAvqg,Don S.,"Minneapolis, MN",2 star rating,"This was the poutine king during past visits, and I was happy for them to be noted as the most authentic in a New Yorker article about poutine after my first visit years ago. But it seems to have gone south. This time, the fries were greasier and soggy. The gravy had a nice flavor, but it was just lukewarm, and the cheese curds remained cold clumps between the not so great fries and lukewarm gravy. I like the size of the place and its vibe, and the servings are generous, but this visit was disappointing. As others here have pointed out, maybe my issue was that I was sober - but I've had better here before."
/user_details?userid=b4Co_6GZZDLndQPGX53hEw,Mona P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Ok place to go at 2 or 3am but the poutine isn't so tasty.  My companion also claimed that the fries aren't crispy enough. The sauce was mediocre as well.  But if you're looking for late night eats in the neighbourhood, it's an option."
