/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A friend knew of the artist playing live music for the night, Marika Galea and recommended this Vegan spot for drinks and jazz music. We reached around 9 and ordered drinks and their famous Chilli Guacamole Rice Bowl!  The quality and taste of the food is excellent. Shockingly this cafe has American prices (low) and American portions (large)! Had a great time and would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice (Vegan) meal with live music on a weekday!"
/user_details?userid=oCKtbgKBtYb44q1zqqefNA,Rosalie C.,"Milwaukee, WI",4 star rating,"#veganI was going to give 3 stars but felt a little unfair with my limited experience. In comparison to some other places... Ill give 4, as I still want to write about it. I stayed with family in downtown and was out walking all day. This place was one of the farthest. Probably about 40 minutes away. I kept going place to placed and pushed myself to get here. I am glad I did!! Apparently in this Mile End area (I like), as I approached I wondered how to get in. You see the sign and then have to go down into the underground. Dark little spot that goes back quite aways. I could imagine coming here in the evening and listening to some music... as a morning coffe shop, maybe not so much. One of the reasons I came was for the icecream and mac and cheese. Two things I love to compare and contrast. She explained their icecream was like a frozen yogurt base, so I was nervous but wow!  It was just a small bit in a little bowel. A perfect amount to try. The consistency was perfect. The taste was awesome. It was just right,  I only wish I had more now!!  The mac and cheese unfortunately had to be repackaged for me to take to go but no worries. I took that home so I admit to not trying it while fresh. It did have a bit of that crispy on top, needed more. The mac and cheese was good but nothing special. I added on more cheese at home to make it just a bit more exciting. The staff was nice enough. Overall I had a decent experience. The place was interesting just a little dark. The icecream was wonderful. I would like to go back to try more food. Wish it weren't so far from where I was staying, would have liked to have tried more food."

They play great eclectic music during the day and have decent live shows from local musiciens in the evening.While I visited I had one of their vegan meals. It was called the Victoria bowl. It included their very own Kimchi, which was actually pretty good. Coffee was great too, but you cannot expect any less in this part of town. I highly recommend this spot if you are craving some healthy vegan food."

/user_details?userid=xpcb1eyHT44iT2pi_WdeWg,Derek D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5 star rating,"I was thrilled to find another place in the Plateau with great vegan breakfast options. I got the breakfast plate mostly because I wanted sweet potatoes. I was very happy with it. The tempeh bacon was good and it probably was some of the better scrambled tofu I've had. The real highlight, though, was the toasted banana bread I ordered on the side. With sunflower seed butter, I could not have been more satisfied!"

Resonance is amazing - the best mac & cheese ever, EVEN THOUGH it's vegan, incredible salsa, wonderful chili and a really lovely selection of teas. I don't think there are words for how good the food here is. I'm not so hot on the cakes but that's ok, I'm not a huge cake person anyway. I love you Resonance Cafe"
/user_details?userid=ATs2MP17OY62puUWArwBPg,Jamie P.,"Delray Beach, FL",5 star rating,"This is my favorite vegan restaurant in Montreal.We ordered the avocado toast, TBLT, and MacNCheez. The food came out fast and it was so good my boyfriend is ordering a TBLT and MacNCheez to bring home with him. Definitely recommend the TBLT. For dessert we got the carrot cake, chocolate oatmeal cookie, and icecream. Everything was amazing. Especially the carrot cake. I should also add that they have a student Menu monday-friday and the items on that menu cost $4.75 Highly recommend this restaurant and I'm sure we will be returning if we have the chance"
/user_details?userid=XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,Vanessa F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Very disappointing. Came here during the day, first time. Was looking forward to it. Pretty appalling service. The interior is not particularly cosy either, definitely looks more like a live music venue than a café. Wouldn't go out of my way to return."
/user_details?userid=UjBYwCGlpxeSDEIWhYWdlQ,Crystal E.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"There are so many amazingly delicious vegan places in Montréal. Sadly, this is not one of them. The food was ok, we had nachos, pizza and Mac and cheese. Nothing blew me away. Staff was not friendly or engaging at all. We were not greeted, we were not smiled at. We're from New York so we don't even have high standards for service so that's how you know this place is lacking. Only when the guy brought the food to the table is when we heard more then 2 words come out of someone's mouth. He was nice. Then, not knowing water was self serve, we asked for a glass of water and a female staff member said ""it's over there, you can get it yourself"". Tone is everything. Everywhere else we have been in Montreal the staff has been a delight. This really killed the experience for us. Best thing about this place is the free WiFi."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"I still love this place but I need to update this just a bit based on the dish I had last night. I will say, the people working there are great, it's still a pretty magical chill basement venue for readings and music, and there are great beers on the list these days including tasty offerings from Trou du Diable. But last night I ordered the Avocado Roll Bowl and while there were tasty elements, overall I found it deeply frustrating as a dish. I wish I'd ordered the chili or the mac and cheese that looked more reasonable. The Avocado Roll Bowl looked pretty when I got it, but it was a small amount of rice covering a hidden fistful of pickled ginger lurking right where you might mistake it for something you could reasonably take a big bite out of. On top of the rice there was a huge fistful of grated carrots, topped by a think mountain of mashed avocado towering over the top of the bowl. It was nearly impossible to get through the thick layers of raw ingredients to make a decent edible bite. Stirring wasn't happening in the small bowl. Nice fresh ingredients and flavours, don't get me wrong, I just think whoever is in charge of the menu needs to sit down and try to eat this dish as it is being prepared, and maybe rethink some life choices."
/user_details?userid=j6oWbolGwvNMIr7KlToBCQ,Dumaresq D.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Spartan counter service in a jazz space so hip it feels like everyone should be wearing a beret and smoking thin cigarettes. The abstract jazz music playing was a little too abstract and a little too loud for our tastes.The vegetarian sandwiches are good, but the smoothies are extraordinary- my girlfriend and I were blown away. The ""Green Chimneys"" was a particular hit. Reasonably priced too. If you want a healthy and tasty breakfast, this is the place to go."
/user_details?userid=5WdBw9XyBEYi4Dzb4UhvIQ,Jonathan K.,"Westborough, MA",5 star rating,"Such a great ambiance here!!! Everyone, vegan or not, should come here at least once on a weekend night. The nachos are a classic, and the desserts are spectacular. The music is (usually) lively and engaging, but sometimes has a cover that can get expensive for students. Overall, I'm really excited to go back!"

If you are looking for a casual rustic environment to sit over coffee, I​ would strongly recommend it"
/user_details?userid=GxzhQZokFig02SwfVhGQlA,Jenny X.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"When you feel like you need a break from poutine and smoked meat, this place offer some great vegetarian/vegan options that aren't just salads. I had the Victoria bowl which had brown rice, pickled carrots, kimchi, cucumbers, tofu, and a soy-sesame based dressing. I ordered for pick up so I was able to walk in, pay, and walk out in no time."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I thought this place was the bees knees.My partner and I visited during the day on a weekday, so alas, no live music. Needless to say, I need to go back and get the full resonance effect.My food was delicious and the menu at large was cheap (a big deal for vegan fare in this city!) The coffee was supreme and the Victoria bowl was boss- more similarly epic things with kimchi need to be done in this world. Differently, my partner found the breakfast sandwich kinda meh so I'd maybe suggest sticking with the bowls? Go figure.Oh yeah, the atmosphere was warm and inviting: you could totally bring anyone and everyone here for a good hangout and no one would be out of place."
/user_details?userid=baiRZ5SXp2CA6MIMu8zZCA,matt s.,"Duxbury, MA",5 star rating,"100% VeganBesides the vegan Poutine I ate during my stay in Montreal, the next best thing was the breakfast sandwich with tempeh bacon from Resonance. I'm not a huge fan of tempeh, but this house-made stuff was baked and seasoned to perfection. The grilled panini style sandwich has tofu scramble, sliced tomato and cashew cheese, all between fresh bread from a local bakery (can't remember which). I also got a cappuccino, prepared artfully by the well-mannered barista from Kentucky. The place has jazz music every night, but unfortunately was not able to get here for a show. Though, I can easily see it being my favorite place to eat and listen to live music. When I leave Montreal to go back to the states, this place alone will definitely bring me back to this great city."

/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,A very hipster feeling cafe that turns into apub with live music. The food is a little pricy (under 10$ but not big portions) but its a vegeterian place with lots of vegan options...my wife was so happy. I would have goven them 5 stars but the service (for coffee) was extra slow. We had the BLT which was great and so was the house sandwich. Defenetly on my revisit list.
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"I typically go here on Sunday evenings for Kalmunity's Jazz improv night, which on its own is a great time. This time I came during daytime hours, and sans the musical entertainment, the experience was solid. While there isn't much of a terrace and the interior decor could use a remix, the space is large, and seats are easy to come by. I ordered an avocado chili bowl and it was great; slight kick with lots of texture and flavor. The staff was super cool and accommodating. They also serve alcohol for those seeking a shot of Jameson in the middle of the day."
/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If I was rating this place on their smoothies alone it would get 5stars. Where can you get a delicious, filling smoothie in this town for under $7 anymore?! Right here! But! I have only got them to go cos I'm personally not into the basement dimly lit vibe, nor being surrounded by people on their laptops. But! If you like those things or are looking for somewhere to work - this could be for you! I won't beat around the bush here - but if you're not into the scene of eating salads out of a mason jar this place is probably not for you. I'll come back and get stuff to go, but I probably wouldn't sit in - not during a sunny day anyhow. Also music in the evenings. May be your thing also....I was served with a smile and it was appreciated."

However, the food is GREAT! My friends and I split a few dishes and got dessert and everyone was truly incredible, plus, the prices are low too. The ambiance is good and they have live music. A great vegan spot :-)"

/user_details?userid=WFP-b1Aep71xjS3TiGEC2Q,Sophia H.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"PBJ (sunflower seeds and almond) smoothie was quite good. It was made with sunflower seed butter (my first time trying) instead of peanut butter; both butter types are pretty similar - the thick texture was the same, but the taste was distinctly of sunflower seeds. My sister got Bol Victoria (a type of rice bowl); it was Korean-style and pretty spicy and tasty, but I didn't like the tofu much, which was too hard and bland for me. The band was playing on a Friday night we were there, and it was pretty good. Place is really quite dim though - it's fine for working on a computer but rather too dark to read a book (I sat at the front, next to the glass, so it was better). Just keep in mind that this is not a good cafe to read books."
/user_details?userid=IM8PXzTxEXg1rcX5zO3LGw,Mandy L.,"Delaware, OH",5 star rating,"Uh, where do I start? We didn't start out to eat here, but I am so glad we stumbled across it! (Also, please note, I am a practicing omnivore, and I still loved it.) It has, hands down, some of the best-quality coffee I've ever had! As a former barista, I can appreciate the care they take to measure out the espresso for each shot and take the steps necessary to get a balanced and adventurous espresso, and it was well dialed-in. The food - heavenly. The chiliguacamole was out of this world flavorful and my friend definitely enjoyed the Victoria Bowl. And what an awesome surprise it was that a live band played some upbeat, fun salsa music that evening. This was my favorite place I visited in Montréal and I would definitely recommend it to everyone who visits. If I lived in Montréal, I'd be here every day."

The menu is just the right size, especially when you're the type of person like me who has a hard time choosing! Staff is a bit on introverted shy side..Many many people seem to come here to work on their laptops...which gives the place a kind of school cafeteria vibe, which is not a bad thing! It gives it a relaxed, ""minding my own business"" tone. Would need a bit of love in the ""looks department"" but doesn't affect the overall experience. I have a feeling the vibe is a bit different in the evening because they have live bands playing. Can't wait to come and check that out :-) Love this place and will definitely be coming back !P.S. The Alpukat smoothie... OMG seriously the best combo ever!! Espresso... Avocado wow!"

I strongly recommend the avocado rice bowl! They really care about the products that they sell at the cafe. Disclaimer: I'm friends with one of the baristas, but I know for a fact that he personally sources his beans (and wants nothing but the best), and has been learning everything that he can about the roasting and brewing processes to bring you the best coffee. If you're into jazz, or even if you're not. Check it out!"

/user_details?userid=TqKg5XonFWPAacSLpUNIVQ,Prog C.,"Madison, WI",4 star rating,"My friend and I stumbled upon this cute, artsy, roomy yet cozy, just below street-level café in the Mile-End neighborhood. Playful experimental jazz played just quietly enough to not be a distraction, and it seemed like a good place to settle in and get some work or studying done or meet with a friend for some coffee and conversation. The warm, cozy vibe would be particularly attractive on a bitterly cold mid-winter afternoon. Resonance was fairly crowded on the Tuesday afternoon I was there, but not so much so that we had to fight for a seat. And Mac lovers, take note: this place is for you. You think I'm kidding? It was like some kind of covert Apple advertising scheme. It's amazing I didn't get kicked out with my tiny Gateway joke-for-a-computer. The only infinitesimal criticism I have about the atmosphere is that my friend and I wanted to sit on the stools in the front window and get an ounce of Vitamin D, but there weren't any outlets there. As far as food and drink is concerned, though they had an amazing selection of smoothies (many with espresso and chocolate in addition to fruit), I opted for the Rooibos latte. Big mistake. Though it was beautifully presented and exuded cinnamon from the moment it was set on the table, it tasted funny, as though the barista had had a heavy hand with the saccharin (though I hope that there wasn't actually saccharin in it). Since I don't really drink Rooibos tea, it's impossible for me to say if it's the Rooibos flavor I didn't like or if it the latte just wasn't good. I'll give Resonance the benefit of the doubt and assume that I just don't like Rooibos. But if you're a hard-core Rooibos fan, by all means, go ahead and order it.My friend, on the other hand, lucked out. He ordered the $8 soup of the day, which turned out to be Spicy Mexican. It was thick, tomato-based, resonant with garlic and black pepper, and had quite a kick in addition to a generous portion of corn tortilla chips. If it's the soup of the day again, I'd highly recommend getting it. Great way to ward off the cold."

/user_details?userid=6qRaKVUVOEINVUvkE84ucw,Mike L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For real, oasis aimed straight at me...Just a little ridiculous that this place would be on the block I moved into. I've been vegan for 14 years, and this spot is easily my favourite ""vegan café"" in existence. There are others?! A vegan JAZZ café?? I originally came here to see a pal from out of town play a show, but came back to try the breakfast sandwich a couple dozen times. I'll be back for more, yeah. Also, the carrot cake is perfection. The homemade almond/coconut milk works real well in the latté as well, but I usually get the espresso. It works!Please don't come here unless you want the best experience you can have spending money at a local vegan-friendly and good tunes-playing hangout."
/user_details?userid=zrxI4UP5BhuzX_5SsmzQEw,Beatrice L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I'd read excellent reviews about this place, many of which mentioned its environment being a favourite spot to work at in the neighbourhood. When I walked in, EVERYONE was typing or reading away on their laptops. Kind of funny. Not many people were eating but that didn't stop me from ordering the quinoa bowl (with added tofu, cost extra) and an Alpuka smoothie. Both were EXCELLENT! I did want the bowl to eat-in, with the smoothie to-go though and the guy packed everything to go. No matter, I remained seated at my table and ate in happy silence whilst listening to Little Dragon, the rain coming down hard outside. My only complaint would be the service; they don't really put customers first here. The cashier was busy chatting away with her colleague half the time--making their conversation heard to the entire café, no joke--only stopping to look at her phone the other half of the time. But I guess that is how relaxed this place is and nobody else seemed to care as much as I noticed. Come for the food and atmosphere. Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=pjZHcJtf5gZDdXStAfdKZw,LB B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I reviewed this café originally about a year ago and gave it 4 stars, naming a few minor critiques. But now, after having been here a few dozen times, I feel compelled to re-write my review and add another star. It is my opinion that since first opening, this café has worked out the kinks and really upped their game, all while keeping portions generous and the food delicious. Basically, it is my favourite place to eat with a friend or study for exams in the Mile End. FOOD: This is a vegan café. They serve a small but fierce menu of rice bowls, sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods. My personal favourites are the BLT (tempeh bacon!!!), the caesar salad and the channa bowl. I have also tried their chill, which is excellent and their guacamole is very rich and delicious. All of their portions are fair for the price and the quality of food is top-notch. It's not fancy or showy, but it tastes amazing and you feel good after eating it. They also have a pretty great menu of beverages, including some good quality loose leaf teas, homemade lemonade and good smoothies. Oh and they just added vegan soft serve ice cream to the menu!!! Just in time for summer :) ATMOSPHERE / STAFFIt is a giant place decorated casually, very homey and down to earth. Lots of spots with power outlets. The music is generally jazz or other instrumental stuff. So really, the place is a dream for studying or chatting with a buddy. It's a basement place, so there isn't really much natural light, which is a draw-back, but they've done a good job of making the place bright and cheery, very un-basement-like. The staff are really nice and generally very good at what they do. They have live music every night, which is very nice if you are going to the show, but a little frustrating if you just want to have a meal. It becomes a difficult negotiation sometimes between customers just there to eat good food and the show organizers who want you to pay cover and/or not speak while they are playing their experimental music despite the fact that you are far at the back and just trying to eat with your date. Basically, i'd suggest going here early (daytime or before 8pm) and/or having back-up plans if you arrive past 8pm to discover that it's a packed house for a loud show that costs $8."

/user_details?userid=fv8IIPpV127YFGTMB1oM9w,Stefanie S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Great little coffee shop. As a former fromage-lover who turned vegan for health reasons, I can honestly say that their cashew cheese is one of the best I've ever had. I had the grilled cheese (really good bread, Earth Balance, cashew cheese, +apple slices) and my omnivore husband got chili with guacamole and cashew sour cream. He begged me to replicate the sour cream as soon as we get back home -- that's a ringing endorsement from someone who eats dairy on the daily."
/user_details?userid=t21VgnkAWuUS1Ho7Lh1UtQ,Sam B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The prices for this place have increased 3 times in the last 5 months, while the portions/quality has remained the same (really simple rice/chile/tofu dishes, premier moisson bread and hummus,  generally stuff  that tastes like your hippy roommate's food from college)., all the drink prices have increased too,  to the point where i'd rather head down the street, grab a cheap latte  and listen to  a love supreme at home. For shame, resonance, for shame."
