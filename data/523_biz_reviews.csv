/user_details?userid=jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,Ali A.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,Family owned business. A Korean chef. They are known for the Bibimbap. I tried it and loved it instantly! They keep serving roasted rice tea which goes very well with meal. They are very helpful with the items on the menu and with suggestions for those new to Korean cuisine. Make sure you trY the soft candy they serve at the door after you pay the bill I already have plans to stop by again.
/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Korean Mexican fusion. There kimchi rocks! Fresh, a bit of crunch, right amount of kick and made in house. This place is located beside CDN metro and east to find parking on the side streets. They serve alcohol.The owners are super friendly and if you engage in conversation you'll get to know a lot about the food there. I've been there more then a dozen times over the years and one thing I can say is that it's consistent. The food is fresh, great all round flavors and they keep it simple. The prices are very reasonable and defiantly cater to the area (students  and locals) If ur going in for the first time I recommend the Bibimbap a stone bowl. I do like that they offer special meals that are not on the standard menu just to change it up. This were they had tortillas (Mexican twist to the resto) and grilled calamari. They do start u off with this amazing barley tea throughout the meal .. a nice touch to just simple water or Jasmin tea. There is such a liking to it that they now see the package on site. Another way this place listens and caters to there clients! Have a drink and enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"So one of my favourite Montreal date nights is to pick a place from my long To Try list up in the Cote-des-Neiges area and go for a food adventure and then a weird movie experience at the Star Cite cinema nearby (so weird. So great.) Last night I took my baby to Pocha de Marie and we had such a lovely meal and great chats with Steve, one of the owners, I can't wait to go back. We shared a tofu kimchi jjigae and a daily special with 6 mushrooms and though both dishes were hefty and bountiful we couldn't stop eating and we polished it all off. The house hot sauce was awesome on everything, and the Beau's beer on tap was a bonus. They also had the Ippon beer by Jukebox on tap which I had never tried before but got to sample and it's so great and such an awesome choice to pair with these flavours. We also rediscovered the toasted barley tea and were able to take home a big bag of tea bags, organic, for 3$, the perfect thing for winter. This place is small and unassuming, decorated very simply if a little choatically but perfectly clean. I'd suggest removing any unhealthy looking plants, that always gives me bad vibes, and taking down any unnecessary decor, and really just keep focusing on doing the amazing job they are doing with thoughtful, clean, interesting food and drink. The vegetarian options were super excellent and in general we just loved it."
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Discovered this restaurant through Yelp app. Found the menu very interesting and many good reviews! So it was a must try for me!Disappointment.Got my free kimchi for checking-in on Yelp app. It tasted a lot of the sesame oil that they put in it. At the bottom of the dish, we could actually see the oil floating... It was spicy enough to my liking though!Tried the bibimbap, kimchi-bulgogi burger and tacos! The bibimbap was bad. It was tasteless. Had to add a lot of their spicy sauce in order to have some flavour. The vegetables that they put as toppings, some were extremely salty and some extremely sour...  The tacos. Tried the bulgogi and spicy pork. They were good, but could be better. I find that it was lacking the korean touch on it. For some reason, it tasted similar to tacos that I had at a Mexican restaurant. I think the marinade of the meat could be a bit more korean traditional. The burger was ok. Same as for the tacos, it tasted bland and lack some korean-ness.The service was good! We were greeted rapidly. Food came relatively quick. We we're sharing food and they actually separated the burger for us! Thumbs up for that!Overall, very cool concept of korean fusion! There could be improvements for the taste of the food (more korean seasonings/marinade)! Good service! But it will probably be my only visit there."
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Decided to come here after finding out that my usual restaurant was closed today. I've heard great things about this place thanks to a few yelpers, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to try it. When I arrived with my friend, the restaurant was empty and we picked the table in front of the large window facing the street. We were immediately served warm tea (perfect drinking temperature!) and given menus. We spent so much time choosing! We ended up ordering a taco party (non-traditional Korean) and a Korean BBQ (traditional). While waiting, we got our free kimchi (yay yelp check ins!). We wanted to taste it first, then wait to eat it with our food. However, it was just too good! We could stop, even if we kept saying ""this is the last piece. Stopping now."" We ended up finishing the entire thing... oops! The taco was obviously a Korean-Mexican fusion dish. It actually tasted amazing! I don't know what they add to that guacamole, but it's delicious! This dish was somewhat oily though, so I had to go wash my hands afterwards :) The Korean BBQ was also quite tasty. The flavours were nice. The broccoli in it was AMAZING! Sadly, there were only three pieces :( lots of other veggies though! We then shared a dessert, 1 scoop of ginger ice cream and 1 scoop of red bean ice cream topped with pineapple coulis and 2 ginger cookies. It was so good! We also drank A LOT of tea... way too much tea. I had at least 7 glasses. Probably more. The price is also very reasonable. The entire meal cost us about 25$ each after tax/tip. They run such an amazing restaurant. Definitely worth a visit!"
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. Finally did and I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be considering the rave reviews. They bring you toasted barley tea which is quite delicious. Similar to genmaicha in taste. I had the bulgogi bibimbap. I feel like the taste was very bland. The meat was good but the entire bowl was missing something. Also they didn't explain to us that when it arrives sizzling you should wait a good 10 minutes so the rice becomes a bit more crispy. I didn't know that so the rice was a bit soggy at first. Not sure I would come back...
/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place with great ambiance. Just next to University of Montreal. I believe it's first korean restaurent near UdeM. They don't have many dishes, but they offer tasty dishes. Very good.Also it's not expensive.Edit : they should offer kimchi or kimchi radishes like other korean restaurents."

The only two things on the menu I am obsessed with and also, on uber eats! I would eat this everyday if I can only afford too! Love how they make them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend this place! Awesome cooks & service!!!!!!!!"
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ok, so this is a family run place and they are very passionate about the business and food. Positive. The place is cute and we'll located and is a great choice in the area. Positive. Now the Korean food is good, but the Korean dishes I had were not blow your mind. So the thing is they do Korean Mexican and that is when it gets interesting in my humble opinion. Basically, Korean Mexican is awesome all across the US. I've had in Austin and LA and the stuff is huge....and good. Now we finally have a place selling some items here. More than positive, Awesome. I really enjoyed my Kimchi burrito...it was spicy! My other dishes were fine, but explore and ask questions. The owners will Iove it. Last point, they have some environment friendly takeout containers - a new criteria for me. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't go to the Cote des Neiges neighbourhood too often so I am not very familiar with the dining options here.  That is why I jumped at the chance to attend a Yelper Adventure at Pocha de Marie, a newish restaurant in the area.  It's a very casual place serving up Korean food  with a little bit of Korean/Mexican fusion thrown in.Like I said the menu is mostly Korean but there are a few Korean/Mexican fusion dishes thrown in there like kim chi burritos. I figured I would give the fusion a taste and ordered the tteokbokki au gratin.  This dish was tteokbokki, which contained fish and some kind of rice dumpling in tomato sauce, covered with cheese and thrown in the oven.  While it was on the heavy side it was delicious.  It was also a bit spicy which I liked.  The portion was huge and I actually wasn't able to finish it.If you are in the mood for a cocktail then you should try their creation, the Kimchilada, which is a take on the michilada.  Instead of using lime they use kimchi juice and they line the rim of the glass with spicy seasoning instead of salt.  I really enjoyed the cocktail and I have to say that I'm glad that they used spicy seasoning instead of salt to line the glass because it added a little kick to the drink.  Prices were incredibly reasonable.  I only paid about $30 for my meal after tax and tip and given the quality and quantity of the food I felt that I got my money's worth."
/user_details?userid=cYrChYDCfkYafbDkSbLqtg,Roxanne M.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great and only Korean restaurant in the upper cote des neiges area. They offer free tea which today was iced because it's starting to get warmmm outside.  They have a nice and sunny little terasse to enjoy. This place opened in October 2016 and is continuously upgrading their menu (so it is very likely that the waiter will offer you meals that are not on the menu etc.)The vegetarian  dolsot bibimbap is only 11$ and you can pick how you want your egg to he cooked. For only 2. 50$ extra you can choose to add meat or tofu and you can pick 3 veggies to put in your bibimbap (for free) see pictures formore details.  Their homemade sauce is offered on the side so you can pick your level of spiciness yourself They take reservation, accept cash credit and debit and have delivery with Uber eats. Plus free WiFi password : kalbitaco74 Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great Korean bar b q tacos ! Had discovered this place by ordering on Uber eats and when my bulgogi tacos arrived I had a whole bunch of toppings and warm tortillas that arrived ! The meat was delicious and really could just melt in your mouth. The plate comes with a large portion of bulgogi meat, guacamole, pico de galo, lettuce, sweet dipping sauce and tortillas. Really great fusion of Korean and Mexican and I recommended it to everyone !"
/user_details?userid=Xva4TLRyUOEYqVKKCxwZaw,Emily B.,"Greensboro, NC",5 star rating,"Amazing Korean Mexican fusion. Very casual. GreAt selection. Don't ask for sake. We had the quesadilla, ravioli, bibimbap, tacos and bbq plate. Everything was AMAZING. very flavorful , smoking hot and generous portions. Come hungry!"
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Happy 1 year anniversary to this restaurant!!I didn't get the chance to eat there when yelp has an event. I miss out on some great food there! The menu has variety. I ordered the bimbibap with bulgogi and I had three different vegetables to choose from the set of 6. After 5 minutes, the food arrived. The bimbibap and the spicy sauce was separated. The server remembered i dont like spocy food and it was replaced by teriyaki sauce instead.  Overall, the place has a lot of potential to stay. The mixture of korean and quebecois style make this little place a special one. Keep the innovation coming and keep serving awesome tea! The service is excellent with a very knowledgeable owner!"

Friendly staff and a good place to eat alone or with friends. Food is worth it's price. Unique burrito. First time tasting something like this.
/user_details?userid=-y8mv6-8C-IJWsy00EWAfA,Jehanne A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried this place on (yet another) work lunch. We were all pleasantly surprised. The staff is very friendly. The lunch menu is small, which to me is good for lunches as you don't want to waste to much time pondering what you might eat.There's a choice of bibimbap, ramyun and other korean food served a more occidental way.I had the bulgogi ramyun soup and it was quite good though it could have had more beef. Only down point is I didn't get why I received a bowl of rice even though I had noodles in my soup!It's quite affordable for lunch as well (9$ the ramyun soup), so all in all a nice lunch place if you ever fancy some korean food."

/user_details?userid=t5x15lo8kicUKnyUeQkaCA,François L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The staff is nice and the place can be pleasant when it's not busy, but there are better options in the area. I went there for lunch on a weekday and the place was about 80% full but the kitchen was already unable to cope. It took forever to get our food. It gets fairly noisy when it's busy, which doesn't make the waiting more pleasant. I had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) and was disappointed. It was dry and tasteless like this review. The marinated daikon that came with it was yummy though, but that's about the only thing that I really liked in this dish."
/user_details?userid=EOrybBqGdnbV-opNmaXTUg,Melanie V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great new place in the neighbourhood. Surprised to see the owner take special care of our table and made sure we were happy. Had the dumplings, edamame and squewers to start,  the bibimbap and the bbq platter as a main. Delicious. Highly recommend for a date or even a staff party. Good selection of meals to share and specialty imported drinks. Love the Soju."
/user_details?userid=j3qBRAq_XSSkXhmENA_pQQ,Allie C.,"Fabreville, Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to a lot of popular korean restos in downtown mtl and I have to admit the food from this restaurant is super great if you want to change it up a bit. The food is very beautifully presented and its very tasty! I feel like there's not so much oil compared to other kr restos i've been to( where I just end up feeling bloated wt a stomach ache because of how oily the dishes were). Also, the spiciness of their tobbeoki is on point! It's not overly spicy and the amount of melted cheese on top is very generous. The mandu salad was very tasty aswell! I like the tea drink they serve and the service is very friendly. I'll definitely come again to taste other dishes."

Catered to all dietary needs - vegetarian / vegan friendly and can even accommodate gluten free . The owners explained the menu and answered all questions with patience - very knowledgeable about dishes and proud of their little establishment . They call the cuisine ""modern Korean""  but there was a little bit of everything on the menu from Asian style dishes to burgers and tacos, - hints of Mexican and barbecue in many dishes. The appetizers were very tasty- make sure to try the dumplings ! BIbimbaps entrées with choices of ingredients and options to make them vegan or vegetarian ... I have a newfound liking towards fiddleheads ! Range of sauces from mild to super spicy - everything was flavorful, including the red bean ice cream with sweet potato purée and rice cakes on top! I can't wait to  return - extremely reasonable prices were an added bonus ! This restaurant is a new hidden gem in the cote des neiges area !"
