The quantity more than compensated. Everything was amazing down to my new favourite soft drink Inca Cola.I will be going many more times to try the different items in their menu and each time I will do my best to report back.For the curious, I ordered the ceviche solymar and the seafood mussels.I had the fish/shrimp soup, nice but was too much. Oh and we were two people so this was way enough."
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Last time I went to Solymar, I was a bit under the weather and unfortunately I couldn't enjoy the food. This time, believe me, I had for my money. The food is delicious, tasty and flavoured. I had a really good time for a Thursday night. It's different than what I'm used to and I'm glad we did it. Everyone is entitled to an opinion I still don't get how this place gets poor reviews."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I enjoyed my experience at Solymar. This is a solid location if you want to enjoy some authentic Southern American cuisine. Upon stepping in you find yourself in a pretty yet cozy and intimate setting ideal for groups/parties/birthdays and so forth. The music is dope and keeps you highly entertained as you enjoy your evening. Each table comes with a complimentary plantain and roasted corn. You can ask for sauces for extra enjoyment and they're so good and addicting I had to step away or I'd fill myself up before my meal!I went with their jalea personal (fried seafood) alongside a traditional pisco sour. Whoa mama! That pisco sour came out... and it was soooo beautiful... and they make them stroooong!! A bit too much for my taste but hey in the end I felt like I had two drinks instead of one. :)I really enjoyed the fried seafood, it was all quality stuff and tasty! I would have liked some side lemon/lime to garnish it with or maybe some sauce but I guess I'll stick to the traditional way! Big servings!For dessert I went with a plate of picarones. Never had it before and I was curious how they tasted like. They're made with squash and sweet potato and served in a doughnut form and covered with syrup made from chancaca. Anyways, I hated it. Nothing to blame the resto, just not for me haha!Pricing was quite decent for seafood and it was overall a positive experience. Service is nice but they're pretty slow. I wish they'd serve a few extra trimmings with the meal, I felt there was always something missing. For example, asking for sauce with the apps, no lemon/lime with seafood or completely disappearing once our main meal was served. I'm really not a fan of chasing my waiter."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here on a recommendation - it's a bit further away than we normally feel like traveling for a Sunday dinner but my friend who was visiting wanted some seafood. Outside of New Orleans I'm use to seafood always being expensive, and it wasn't cheap here per se but it was a great value. The portions are huge! My husband and I split the mixed ceviche and one of the mixed fried platters and we were completely stuffed. The ceviche was especially impressive - I loved the flavors (fresh and a little spicy) and the seafood was tender. the fried platter was a LOT of fried, so you have to be in the mood for that or split it with people. My friend got one of the mussel dishes and it came in a large bucket with fries. I can't remember which flavor she got but it was super tasty. She also got the small ceviche on the side and the portion on that was impressive as well compared to a typical restaurant's ceviche portion. I had a guanabana juice on the side and it was perfect. My favorite flavor,  milky and delicious. I would definitely come back here!"

/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best place in Montreal for traditional Peruvian food. Everything is good here: Lomo saltado, ceviches, aji de gallina, mussels, papa a la huancaina, all sorts of seafood, Chupe de camarones, Jalea, etc etc etc. We were a group of people eating there after a big party the night before. I wish I had taken more pictures, but the food was so good, I was just concentrating on feasting. Literally everything on the menu is excellent. And they will serve Peruvian beer in a freezed glass, awesome to have such a cold beer. And they also have chicha mirada which is beverage made from purple corn, you cannot miss that. Their alcohol coffee (Brazilian and Spanish coffee) are excellent. There are several good Peruvian places in Montreal, specially those that kind of try to fuse it with a more modern approach, those I love them. But if you want to try a traditional one, Sol y Mar is the place to go."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very good food. Ambiance is a bit lacking. Quality price is excellent. It's a bring your own wine which is amazing. Service was great and very friendly. I would definitely go back to try other items on their menu.
/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"Solymar, a name that used to bring joy and excitement upon hearing of this truly unique Peruvian establishment. Full of Latino vibe accompanied with good service and above all, the highlight, flawless food that's like no other. Deliciousness oozing out from eye candy presentation to really really, emphasis on ""really"" to incredible taste in every bite. Have that mixed seafood ceviche once here and bam! If you could dare saying something was wrong about it, chances are it's you who had some serious taste issues. Food here was top notch with reasonable prices that kept us coming back over and over. Sadly, on our last visit yesterday and after an absence of almost 3 years, my small usual group of 4, found out the king of Latino food lost his way. Everything that this place offered, seemed like still being offered and which their full house is a living proof of that. Just as it used to be in the past. Except for the wrong turn they took on the food part. What set us aback upon checking our regular food item prices was the 35% price hike. Compared to what we used to pay 3 years ago and now, we found it to be exaggerated. Cost of living adjustment on my paycheque goes up by 2-3% per year and here by about 11.5%? Not fair amigo, not fair. I can't say the hike was all across the menu because we became accustomed and selective in our choices of food here over the years so can't recall the prices of the rest of the items 7-8 years back. Besides this, I wished the issue stopped at pricing. No, it kept on going yet on another and even worse level: THE QUALITY AND TASTE! Now that is something that makes you fume. If you're going to charge extravagant prices, at least give  extravagant food. We all at the table found this crucial element went down. It's fair to notice that prices went up by 35% but quality down by equally the same percentage. I am saddened to take this restaurant off my list. It used to be THE place for amazing food. Letting my anger control the stars, I was very close giving them 2 only but since I'm still in love with Peruvian food, 3 it is. My next venture would be to find out for myself the best Peruvian restaurant with best price/quality ratio. Who knows, I might get lucky at my first try and become a loyal customer for a long time and the quest stops there. Until then, if anyone reading this and not familiar with Peruvian food, you have to try, it's a must!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is probably one of the most authentic Peruvian restaurant in town. They've been here awhile and have been constant in their food and service. The wine list is good and you pay at the price of the SAQ. They will only charge you a bottle fee of 5,95$ per bottle. Not too bad if you ask me! Some might be surprised by the prices on the menu. Do not be fooled. The portions are HUGE!!! We always have leftover and end up with a meal the next day ;). The food is very well seasoned and well cooked. The only thing was the food was a on the little salty side for me. My husband thought so too but it wasn't anything that stopped us from enjoying our meal. Their papas huancaina is out of this world delicious and they do master their seafood dishes! I've never been disappointed.The service can sometimes be on the slow side but again, nothing too bad. You just have to flag them once in awhile to get their attention. Nothing against the customers, just the way it is because they are very nice and attentive ONCE you get their attention!"

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We tried out this restaurant with a grouo of foodie friends and truly enjoyed it! This cozy resto has been around on St-hubert Street for many years and now know why this Peruvian resto is so popular and loved by many. The resto itself is quite cozy and has two floors which can accomodate large groups. Once you enter the resto , the ambiance quickly transports you to South America with great latin music playing in the background. The service is super-friendly and helpful in suggested great dishes for those who have not yet tasted Peruvian food dishes before. Now for the menu..one word...Wow! So many great dishes to choose from, from mussels, to seafood , grilled meats and ceviches. All their plates are huge portions so I recommennd sharing. I ordered their grilled ribs which were brought to the table in this really cute grilling dish which had charcoal underneath....the ribs were trully amazing!  We also tried the grilled pork chops which were perfectly tender and tasty.  The ceviches dishes were so beautifully plated and wonderful.  This resto is perfect for birthday celebrations, family gatherings and friends get together. Will definately go back to try some of their other great dishes!"

/user_details?userid=vLaMSGUWv7oDcshpep2iWw,Shomoita A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We were craving for mussels and fries and found this place. Honestly the best mussels and fries that I've had in Montreal. The gravy is thick and flavourful. It's too big so we had to bring almost half home and made pasta with it! We tried the mushroom and mussels one and the marinara one. I'm definitely going back there. Also I loved that they keep two small bowls of plantain chips and fried corns on each table as a free starter.

Try their Pisco Sour and just enjoy calamaros fritos."

My Girlfriend is peruvian and she have tried the best peruvian restaurant in Montreal so she said it's the best you can  taste in Montreal ! I went to this restaurant several times and taste the ceviche and the Roasted chicken  and it's always excellent and the service is also very good. So if you want a taste from Peru you can surely have a good idea of what it is to feel the sun on your skin and the nice food in your mouth in this excellent restaurant !If you hesitate between pizzelicoq and this restaurant( they are just beside), just choose the one that are less full as it's the same owner and the food are the same !C'est tout simplement le meilleur restaurant de nourriture Péruvienne à Montréal !Ma copine est péruvienne, elle a essayé les meilleurs restaurants péruviens et elle affirme que c'est les meilleur restaurant Péruvien que vous pouvez déguster à Montréal ! Je suis aller plusieurs fois dans ce restaurant et le ceviche (poisson cuit avec la lime) et le poulet cuit sur le charbon de bois sont excellent, le service est aussi très bon !Si vous voulez avoir une idée de la nourriture Péruvienne typique, vous pouvez utiliser votre imagination et ressentir le soleil sur votre peau ainsi que l'excellente nourriture péruvienne sur vos papilles gustatives dans cet excellent restaurant !    Si jamais vous hésitez entre pizzellicoq  et ce restaurant choisissez le moins plein car c'est le même propriétaire et la même excellente nourriture Lol !"

The restaurant was jam packed with Valentines and therefore extremely busy.  There was a live trio serenading each table which I enjoyed.  There was a language problem with the waiter as I don't speak French and it was quite noisy.The food was good even tho the Filet was a tiny bit overcooked (wasn't consulted how I wanted it cooked but it was good nonetheless.)The meal was served on a dish with live coals under it - kinda neat.Side dishes were rice, grilled veg and a pureed potato spinach side dish.  Very good and so different.All in all a good meal.  Service was slow which is to be expected.  We ordered 2 decaf coffee and got 1 decaf 1 tea no milk.  The cheesecake was sadly not house made and my first bite tasted hard and freezer burned hence the 3 rating.A fun place I would go again."

Staff is super friendly, although that one time the server was Mexican, not Peruvian. Never had a problem with them language-wise because we speak Spanish obviously, but they really try to accommodate everyone.The fact that some people in the reviews are upset because of the English situation seems very ungrateful; these people try their best to speak three languages at work! Meanwhile, we always have to hear you butcher the name of all our dishes... Hmm..."

If you love sour stuffs and seafood I'd recommend that plate. :) Staffs are usually super friendly and fast. However on one night I came there with friends where there was a group of mexican musician, we didn't expect our food to come out after almost an hour. That was the only disappointment and I think they have that festive on a certain date of the week, so make sure to call before hand if you want to have a good experience!"
/user_details?userid=XkzFfufzJWFcuOdk0nTrzA,Katrina T.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered delivery. The anticuchos and trout dish. Honestly, I never order fish in restaurants, let alone delivery but I needed a hearty lean protein after a good workout. The fish was perfect, maybe 8oz with rice and a garlic butter and lemon. It was cooked nicely, somehow kept its crispness with the delivery and still tender. Rice was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. It was exactly what I needed! The anticuchos were very good but overpriced. Working as a peruvian chef, I love anticuchos and know that hearts are cheap. But nonetheless, they were good.I will definitely have their food again, it was delicious!"

I liked the food and the overall ambience.The service was spotty, but quick to correct mistakes. However the main drag of this place is the painful noise level, driven by the in-house band singing Happy Birthday songs at just about every table, with wireless mikes and amplified guitars... And they can go on for two hours straight without a pause :)So, be warned: don't go there if a meaningful conversation needs to take place."

/user_details?userid=K-DzcmfW575JVjkk0KOS_w,Mi G.,"Greenfield Park, Longueuil, Canada",1 star rating,Very disappointed in the price hike and changes in portion size and content of the meals. My jalea had hardly any fish and was mostly fried cassava. The price no longer justifies the food and even the taste has changed. I will no longer come here.
/user_details?userid=hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,Gregory S.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"Came here with some friends (3 total) to get some Peruvian food. Had heard it was good. It is located near Jean talon metro, about a ten minute walk. The atmosphere is unique among Latin American because it is a lot more upscale looking then a lot of other places I have been. There is a small bar and a nice wine cellar.The food was very good and the portions are huge. We shared three platters, which were enormous. The ceviche mix to was really good, a bit salty, but there was lots of fish, calamari, octopus, and other seafood as a part of it.  We also got the jalea, which is a typical Peruvian platter, which had fried cassava and calamari and fish complete with lots of onions all over the place.The last dish was a pot of mussels, calamari and other seafood in a pot of sauce.Everything was good and more than enough to satisfy us all, definitely one of the better Latin places in Montreal."

A large plate of Peruvian aji amarillo (yellow chili) rice mixed with fresh seafood. When I say large, I'm talking large... like huge. The platter was the size James Van der Beek's head, gigantic... like an Elvis Stojko sized gourd."
/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"We've visited Solymar twice on separate visits to Montreal. The first time because a friend in Ottawa recommended their jalea and the second time because we enjoyed it so much the first time. Our first experience was a four-star experience, but the second visit would have only gotten them two stars, so I've averaged it out at three. On our first time the two of us went for dinner. Our server was very accomodating and helpful in choosing portion sizes and dishes. There was a band playing which did make it rather loud but I thought it was fun. On the table are plantain chips and fried or roasted corn, both of which are addictive. We ordered the small Solymar jalea and a small Solymar ceviche and a bottle of Alsatian white to pair with them. We ordered this combination on both visits because they really complement one another well.Just so you know - the jalea and the ceviche come in HUGE portions. We were able to finish them mostly because they were seafood and not too heavy (even though the jalea is fried), but we would have been fine with 2/3 the food. On our second visit we went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon because the boyfriend had been itching to go back with a third person to add some of the barbecued meat to our meal, so we brought his mum. All three of us are anglophones, but we can get by in French if we need to. Our server came to the table and greeted us in French, and when we asked if he spoke English he looked embarassed, said he would find someone who did (also in French, which is fine) and disappeared. From that moment on the staff avoided our table like the plague. Although everyone who came to our table from then on did speak a bit of English (we felt as though we were communicating with them just fine), they were obviously uncomfortable dealing with us and so the service was extremely slow and inattentive. (Luckily we ordered a bottle of wine, so we could pour for ourselves.) We really wouldn't have minded accomodating the staff by making our best attempt at French, but once they found out we spoke English they never gave us a chance. It was realy disappointing. We ordered the jalaea and the ceviche again (still ""small"" plates) and added on beef short ribs from the grill. The jalea and ceviche were as delicious together as we remembered - the lime in the ceviche cuts the fat from the fried seafood just perfectly and the vegetables that come with both are different and delicious. The beef short ribs had a great smoky flavour, but they were very tough. They came with rice and a salad that we didn't end up eating, but only because we had too much food. It's worth noting that while the jalea and ceviche are great for sharing and the portions of all three meals are huge, the way the rice and salad came with the short ribs made it pretty obvious that it's intended to be a meal for one. I always decide to bump a restaurant up to four stars based on whether or not I would go back given that there are lots of other great places to eat. Obviously we felt that way after our first visit, but based on our last visit alone I wouldn't go back to Solymar unless I was with someone who spoke fluent French. There are other Peruvian restaurants in the city, we'll try them out next time we're in the mood."
