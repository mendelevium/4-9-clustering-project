The michelada (beer, with a bit of salt, pepper and lemon) is really good. It's worth the visit to try this type of Mexican cuisine that is not the common offer you find in other Mexican restaurants."

Stoked i order the Tofu Al pastor since it was so close to the real deal last time... so close it left me wondering, well tonight i got my answer...it tasted so much like pork last time because it was, tonight it was clearly tofu, looks, texture and all...Thankfully it's a lifestyle choice and not an allergy. Mistakes happen but still disappointing..."

HOW?It was great, the prices are fair, the staff is helpful, the vibe is cool, and the food is delicious. I do wish they were bigger portions but it is a snack place. I got the Black bean taco. It was delectable."
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It used to be amazing, and their ham and pineapple sandwiches still are. But they recently doubled the size of their room, as well as their menu length. I don't get why they felt the need to add so many new dishes that all look like slight variation on existing stuff. Worst of all, it dramatically lowered the average quality of their offering. The taco chido is basically cheap over cooked rice with dry bits of beef, served on two tortillas. Though it sounds like an end of month broke student meal, I'm sure a talentless millennial could much better with some fridge leftovers and an access to YouTube. Pains me to say this because this used to be my go to Mexican joint."

This place makes the best tinga de pollo torta I've ever tasted. Admittedly, it's the only one I've ever tasted, but I'd like to see anybody try to make one better. Their guacamole is exceptional and the tostadas are magnificent. The cherry on top is the service. Great people, very quick and all around good vibes."

Service was pretty slow. One of my friends ordered crickets!! We were expecting to see the shape of a cricket (maybe a breaded cricket?) but instead she couldn't see the actual insect, just random breaded meat. The torta mole noppales was really good!!!  The Hongos (a panini sandwich) was decent but it was difficult to say for sure as the toast was burnt.Soooooo  -1 star for slow service and burnt toast."

/user_details?userid=VWrLhdKu4ZR2c1JdYXmzNg,Kathleen D.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",5 star rating,I came to Montreal visiting from NJ and just passed by this place and it seemed interesting from the outside. This small Mexican place had the best torta I have ever had in my life. The tinga de pollo torta is delicious. I wish it were a little cheaper but the quality and taste is magnificent. The restaurant setting is filled with interesting toys and a vintage feel so it is a nice place for a hangout.

Funky music, little weird, but if you like different, this is up your alley. Cool Mexican decor. Server was very nice and friendly! Mango fruit juice was WOW. So natural.

/user_details?userid=leZp75aVY7Ka5GOlxyKV3g,Rore T.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Tachido is a  Mexican snack bar that serves up  the yummiest sandwich on the block! Dishes are fresh, portions are hearty, and the space is bright and welcoming.  Even the staff is endearingly friendly and proud to share their establishment with clients. They offer ""torta"" (hot sandwich) with generous fillings of avocado, fried onion, tomato, and cheese with your choice of options like pulled pork or chipotle chicken, served in buckwheat bread or in their homemade, gluten-free, panini-like bread. The corn-tortillas for the quesidillas are made in-house, as are the delectable ""almond cookies"" which I suggest you chomp after your meal! For a fresh meal under $10, Tachido is my new lunch spot on Parc Ave.I've only been for lunch so I wouldn't know about drinks at Tachido other than what's on their menu: specialty drinks including ""agua fresca des dia"" in different flavors every day - when I dropped by it was 'watermelon'. YUM. They also offer Mexican beer and sangria, and hibiscus Margaritas."
/user_details?userid=lPbszXrXKPnRchbzwVbOIg,Steven V.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Had been wanting to try out this place for months, but since I never really go to that area, and couldn't figure out exactly what to expect in terms of size etc, I never felt like journeying specifically. Though, Thursday night I found myself nearby, so I went with a friend.The place is very small, probably about 4 tables, and a 4 seater bar area. But it is very cosy and very cute. We were sat at the bar. Menu was simple and yummy, and reasonably priced. We both had a selection of tacos, and margaritas. And everything was really yummy, and we enjoyed it, although the seating was a bit squished. The service was also great.It's a very similar vibe to Mais down on St Laurent, however, this is the lunch counterpart, where Mais is more like late night. Overall good experience, and I will certainly return if in the area and digging some tacos/margaritas.[This review was changed from a 3 to a 4 star review, because I had previously expressed annoyance that they used powder mix with the margharita, and someone contacted me to ensure me that it wasn't true, and that the powder I thought I saw was just sugar, and invited me in to see for myself.]"
/user_details?userid=oGzoCwxBRB7OjuX5UeOnQQ,Magdalena O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place after searching for gluten-free in Montréal (often a fruitless search) and was luckily nearby with a friend to give it a shot.They have just opened less than two months ago, and it's the owner's first resto venture. Him and his father, who is the baker, were very friendly and talked to me about the resto. The owner's sister and some of her friends are gluten-free and told him that he has to make an option for them.  What did he do? Put his dad to work and create a delicious and chewy gluten free version of their own home made panini-style bread, that includes cheese inside. The main ingredient of the gf-flour is yuca.Onto the sandwiches: I ordered the Chipotle Chicken on gluten free bread & the side beans & watermelon lemonade. It also came with a hot sauce type dip. The owner also brought us pickled peppers to try. The sandwich was delicious and full of stuff inside, which I am still thinking about days later. Like, I cannot stop thinking about it. I wish I lived closer! The beans were too watery and over salted. The watermelon lemonade tasted too fake. The two latter sides are what gives this place a 4 and not a 5. My friend had the pulled pork on regular bread and he was swooning. We were both pleasantly stuffed after the meal. My friend mentioned that often he goes to these types of places and is never full.I will definitely be back many times over, especially at the affordable student pricing.The decor is inviting and very clean. Go!"

The decorations inside are bright and surreal, perfect for a quick inexpensive bright no stress lunch. They do a Sunday brunch, and you can get a perfect margarita here pretty much any time; the cucumber lime margarita was exceptional and just what the doctor ordered to imagine we were far from the snow on a dreary Saturday in January. And of course, as many others have mentioned, delicious homemade gluten free bread. And fish sandwiches coming soon, apparently, watchout!"
/user_details?userid=nTJ81D932bd9tV-dPPAqpA,Scott K.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"This place rocks! The decor is very unique, a very chill and inviting atmoshphere. The food...my god! Their sandwiches, all made on homemade bread is one of the best in the city. The Pierna, or Cubana Torta will leave any meat lover feeling full and satisfied, there is no lack of options for the vegetarian diner as well.  Their Margaritas...There are all very good, the hibsicus margarita is top notch. While paying for a meal recently i was talking to young man who was working about the large amount of tequila in the margaritas. He explained to me that they received complaints from customers about not being able to taste tequila in the margaritas, so they remedied the problem by putting more tequila. I like the way they think:) These drinks are as potent as they are delicious. To boot, the staff has always been very helpful and friendly on my many visits there.  Service is pretty fast, even when the place is packed, which happens often due to its small size."
/user_details?userid=Zo65YWLtfLdixAZ_nL8jdg,zeebo j.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"i went to this restaurant last night, and was pretty disappointed. I gotta say i was also pretty confused when i checked it out on yelp this morning to see really good reviews.  I recently returned from the southwest US, and am now obsessed with Mexican food. in that region, tacos cost about half as much as they do at this place, and have about 3 time as much toppings on each taco. Anyway, i ordered three (different) tacos, and i wish i took a picture for yelp, because they were the saddest, perhaps most pathetic small lump of brown mush enclosed by a soft taco shell, and they all looked pretty much the same, with no additional things to add on top (like pickled onions/jalapenos/lettuce/etc). they tasted okay, but each one was easily consumed in 3 bites. it's kinda sad that the bar for a good mexican place in montreal is set so low. although i gotta say my partner got a sandwich, and that was better, but nothing special. the service wasn't very good, but i felt bad for the waitress because she seemed pretty worn out. needless to say, i'm not going back !"

Between my girlfriend and I, we had 6 of their 8 tacos. I was relatively underwhelmed by the options that I chose, which were all meat, however my girlfriend loved the vegetarian options and really appreciated the variety that is offered. If it was just based on my tacos, I'd give it a 3, but being so vegetarian friendly is a big bonus.People working there were very friendly, I'd go back and try some other things without question."

On the second and third visit I had the the pulled pork Torta sandwiches as well as the pull pork tacos and they were fantastic. The cherizo tacos are also quite nice but not as memorable as the pulled pork. Fans of mole should expect the more traditional cacao mixture rather than the ""chocolaty"" version some placed make.Overall this will be a go to spot for as long as I work nearby."

Pink panther on the screen, heyhey.Montreal restos were burning a hole in my pocket. After several spendy meals, I was ready for a deal, and found one (and one of the best meals of the trip) here. Homemade torta bread and tortillas, smoky mole, tender pork, soup with bananas floating in it, everything was fresh and fantastic. Great drinks, too. Enjoyed a refreshing margarita and luscious strawberry fresca.The art selection rotates, but the cabinet of funky toys stays.I would be a regular here, if only Montreal were my town.Cheers~"
/user_details?userid=FcufsSaz59BJtNv3ibL10A,Sharm C.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a fun kitschy spot that serves Mexican street food that has charisma to spare.  As soon as you step in, you'll notice the display cases surrounding the little restaurant filled with an odd assortment of toys.  It was so whimsical and inviting that I immediately felt nostalgic and comfortable in the space.  In addition, the walls are adorned in some fun street art that I'm sure carry some sort of subversive message.  Definitely interesting.Interesting appearances aside, what's really admirable about this place is that it's family-run and that the food is actually home-made (including the breads).  Another notable thing is that I try to avoid Montreal's offerings of ""Mexican"" food, because it always tastes terrible.  However, this place offers fresh food that isn't your standard bastardized Canadian/American/Tex-Mex phony Mexican fare.  It's prepared with care and creativity by a Mexican family, and tastes nothing like the crap on offer at 3 Amigos or Carlos and Pepe's (ew!!!).  Also, if you're there, make sure you speak to the owner.  He's an interesting filmmaker and both collects and makes the toys that are displayed at the restaurant, and can talk you ear off about the history of his toy collection (pretty fascinating). The menu is fun as well and comes in gluten-free options and vegetarian friendly.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was sizable and tasty.  The pulled pork was good, and the toppings and home-made bread were delicious.  My friend ordered mushroom quesedillas, which were especially delicious because of the home-made cornbread tortillas.  The sauces are home-made and killer good (especially the chipotle one).  We also decided to ""trio"" our meals.  My friend went for the salad, which was good, and I also got frijoles rancheros, a type of soup/dip.  The frijoles rancheros were a bit too salty and runny for my tastes, so I'll opt for that the next time I go.  The drink was a fresca, or freshly squeezed melon juice.  It was nice, pink, and refreshing.Finally, we had to end our meal with corn cake.  Yes, corn cake, with bits of fresh corn baked right into it!  It was absolutely delicious... not too sweet, not savoury, just very tasty and very home-made, but unlike any cake I've had before.  I finished that off with a very delicious coffee.  Both meals plus dessert and coffee came out to a cool 25$.  I'll be back here on a Friday night, when I'm told that the place really opens up as a bar with delicious tacos.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!"

Stick with the quesadillas, though, which are crafted with hand-made corn tortillas. Tacos on Friday and Saturday nights after 8PM. The sandwiches also feature a delicious home-baked bread, which is awesome, but just a little too heavy for me. If you've got Manimal hunger, you'll probably dig it.This may turn into a five with repeated visits (I have yet to try the taco). Kitsch indoor seating with a small terrace out front. Go.

I would not be able to tell their actual names, but we had a good variety of ingredients: guacamole, chicken, pork, beans... All these different flavours at one time can be too much, but this time, it was more about having a rainbow in your mouth: so nice. Do you know this feeling when your brain automatically tries to catch some tastes it knows? Well here, I was doing it, but new flavours were suddenly coming out, mixed with the ones I already knew. That made this experience really enjoyable.Besides their tacos, we had their typical (I guess) sandwich. Dios mio, that was good! Once again, a lot of magical flavours, and the bread (me, French girl) was very nice too.My mexican friend was looking forward to trying their corn cake. Well, that was my first time, andI have to say this is actually good. This did not make my day, but was interesting. Also, I am not really into flans, but the one we have had tonight had a good texture (harder than the ones I am used too) and was pretty tasty.Other good points:- the decoration is so cool (colors, little dolls, Virgin in frames, ""sort of"" statues on the walls)- really affordable for very good Mexican food = worth itLike my Mexican friend does, I will go back there soon for sure!"

A definite win for the neighbourhood, and for my lunch hour.The daily agua is a treat in and of itself - a personal favourite is the cantaloupe.

We both really liked the food, and the servers were friendly, though it was very clear that one of the servers was in training. I had the Sunday brunch with the tortilla, beans, chicken, avocado, and scrambled egg--delicious. My wife had the pulled pork torta (""Pierna""): a generously sized sandwich which was even more delicious. The flavours were strong but not overbearing, and the food in general reminded us of the authentic Mexican we had while in Cancun. The tequila cocktails were good, but not excellent like the food.The price was fair given how good the meal was; 12 for the brunch, 11 for the torta, and 8 each for the cocktails. The location is great, though if you're looking for a ""fancy"" atmosphere, this isn't it: a simple table with chairs on the terrace, or small tables inside. That's not why you'd come here, though. We went for a tasty meal and got it, and will definitely be back again to what is the best-tasting Mexican we've had in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=Tbi5Tw94FRqgvK39WpksKw,Angela M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am so stoked to have discovered this little gem of a restaurant in Mile-End.  The staff are so warm and friendly and most importantly for me they have two gluten-free bread options (regular and cheese) that the father bakes himself.  It's probably the best gluten-free bread I've tried to date.  So far I've had three hot sandwiches there: Pulled Pork (amazing); Ham and Pineapple (filling and a great combo of salty/sweet); Chipotle Chicken (My favorite - with feta cheese.  Flavourful but not too spicy).  The sandwiches are really filling, sometimes I'll even share mine and still feel full.  Prices are $6-$8 for the tortas, so totally worth it!  Also, if you're looking for good gluten free bread you can ask to order some of their gf panini-style buns ahead.  Would probably freeze well.  Grab a friend and give this lovely place a shot!"

Great menu, great atmosphere, great prices,... what more could you want? The tacos and tortas are authentic and delicious, the drinks are excellent, and the service is great. I highly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have been to Tachido's about 6 times. The mole torta is super delicious, all the sandwiches are pretty delicious, their black bean soup is fantastic and the tacos are a small but reasonably priced snack. I especially like their special where you can tack-on a soup or salad and a juice-of-the-day to your bill for a good price. Although I once got dismissed by the owner for sending back a flat beer, the service has otherwise been great."
/user_details?userid=rql4mbtac66YaLyhB72aSQ,Samantha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ta Chido has delicious potato and black bean tacos (not a ton of vegetarian options, but they're good)! The queso topping is great. The ambiance is even better, though - the style of the place is unique and fun, and the guys who run the place are the nicest. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=5eTsdnUKnuxn4wAgXvU_uw,Matthew K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,place was packed and they legit had one server. took forever to get menus... even longer to place order.. to receive food and to get bill. food was solid enough. the seats are really tiny and uncomfortable and tables are very close together. tacos were good.
/user_details?userid=FnCsOVQveOgCprf0kUBshw,Hilary C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was so nice we ate here twice (in one day...)!Based on the reviews here, particularly re: the gluten-free bread and cheapness, we hit this place up during a recent trip to Montreal. We got there when they opened, at noon. Since they'd had a busy night the night before, they were still making the GF bread, and it wouldn't be ready in time! *sob*No matter, the tacos are also g-free. I had the Mole, and the Pulled Pork, based on our server's recommendation. YUMMMMM! Both were slightly spicy and very tasty. I added a trio (combo) to the order, which included a salad with canteloupe in it, and the juice of the day, which was horchata (you can't juice RICE, but anyway). Our server commented that we got express service, being the only ones there... we later found out what he meant!Anyway, the food was so good that we did return later that day (mostly so I could try the bread), and it did NOT disappoint. I think it's a chickpea/corn combo that the chef/dad came up with. The sandwiches are really filling, and come with avocado, tomatoes, mayo, cheese, etc. For round two, I had the Tinga de Pollo, which was my favourite out of everything I ate. Service felt a little hectic (we ended up with a different server in the evening), she forgot our table's drinks and hot sauce when our meals came, but it wasn't TERRIBLE, just busy. Great food, fun atmosphere, good price.I wish/hope that there's a place like this one in Toronto... but I haven't come across it yet!"

Tachido had great recommendations so I had to try!  Its not authentic Mexican but more like ""fushion"" (i hate that word but had to use it). The sandwiches are the only thing i tried. Service and decore are enjoyable. My torta was good but the toppings where very slim!"
/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite places to eat in Mile End. Have eaten here about ten times in the last two years, and have never been disappointed. Great torta sandwiches on slightly chewy, delicious homemade telera bread. Recently rebooted menu now includes tacos at all times (previously just a weekend-night treat), and both regular and green moles. Excellent green and red (chipotle) salsas come in squeeze bottles. Tasty beans with (cotija?) cheese in little earthenware bowls; agua fresca; great micheladas. Soapy telenovelas and movies playing on the big screen; fanciful rotating art and plastic figurine collection. Dense, sweet butter cake if you're not too full."
/user_details?userid=9SqsGj6bKJY_grAA8EbruQ,Kiera A.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Visited Ta Chido by myself for lunch one day in Montreal, super quirky decor, which was awesome, and an added bonus as I didn't have anyone to talk to so it was nice to have cool paper mache heads and dozens of King Kongs to stare at.  I was worried that service would be slow, as there seemed to be only one person attempted to wait tables outside, inside and tend bar, but dude was on point.  I had a strong cucumber-lime margarita, which was perfect for the hot day, a tinga de pollo torta (which is actually a sandwich on bread, not really a torta) with chips and guacamole.  The margarita was heavily poured and top marks for a little hole in the wall place that uses Cointreau in lieu of some bargain basement triple sec, the sandwich (torta) was out of this world, heavily spiced chicken had a very earthy taste along with the grilled veggies, the guacamole was fresh, if a bit runny, and the chips seemed homemade.  I thought prices were a bit on the high end, but this was still only my third or fourth day in the city, so in context I'd say reasonable.  Well worth the visit, next time I'm in Montreal I'll return."
/user_details?userid=f-qTt1zKDH8gKYX3sqFReg,T T.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was good therapy for my taco truck withdrawal.  The tortas are actually better than most you get in the U.S. from a truck, which is good because you're paying more (but not paying much) and sitting down in a really well decorated restaurant instead of getting avocado all over your shirt while driving home.  There's a real focus on making ingredients in-house, so a lot of stuff is quite fresh.  Montréal would seem to snub NAFTA with it's lack of Mexican, but when you find it, it can be quite good and unique like this place."
/user_details?userid=_xgxMsX2f99Cgzy009Y_lg,Irwin K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great spot for small taquiero style tacos, small soft tortillas. Not much to them but you do get 3 on a plate, I tried the potato, pulled pork, and veggie trio and was still a bit hungry after, it would serve them better to be a food truck, I think."
/user_details?userid=coFjUcQ_z84LO77CR_n5Fg,Dane R.,"Asheville, NC",5 star rating,"Yes. This feels right, in the same way that your first bite of grilled cheese was comforting; or when you connected with that pitch and knew it would be a homerun; or when Suzie on the bus wore those really short shorts in middle school - Ta Chido somehow manages to condense all those things into their pulled pork taco, ideally washed down with one of their mercifully not too sweet margaritas, in a science-fiction hipster meets fantasy world of action figures and R2D2 wearing a sombrero. One can't exactly say what the proportions of each ingredient are for something that works greater as a whole than the sum of its parts, and how much of a dash of Han Solo mixed with just the right number of luchadores next to an awesome En Masse mural contributed to that, but when it feels right, it just feels right, and Ta Chido doesn't try to be anything but what it is; a great inexpensive Mexican comfort food joint in the quirkiest possible way."
/user_details?userid=INyWEIyIYH1svRQSMmzY5g,Peter S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really love the food there. Delicious tortas and tacos. The chapulines are not worth getting though, too expensive for a tiny amount. The different margaritas are very nice, the sangria on the other hand is not that great. Overall a very nice little place"
/user_details?userid=X5FbZOsBd-feZkkX0ttHgQ,Rosco P.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Just got back from a quick dinner here. I'm from down South and way West, and I hadn't had a good torta in years. I needed this place.The sandwiches were delicious, the bread is just perfect. With an aqua fresca and soup trio it was an excellent meal and great value. One of the better budget eats around mile end."
/user_details?userid=IryDYja2kFkQEYJ0Kw6GWw,S. S.,"Bloomington, IL",5 star rating,I came for the 3 for $7 Friday night taco deal. I had the vegetarian mole con Nopales tacos with a juice and soup. The soup was pretty small but had avocado pieces in it and the canteloupe juice was delicious. The tacos themselves were incredible! The taste and texture were very good and it was over all too quickly.
