I tried the chicken and coriander along with some sweet potato fries. Both were excellent. The dumplings were fresh and full of juice. You can tell they were homemade and not frozen. The fries were crispy and thicker than usual. I would return in a heartbeat to try more.

It looks like a family operation and they definitely spoke French. Complimentary shrimp chips was a nice touch. Mr Leny enjoyed his pork dumplings. There were 2 veggie choices and I choose the assorted with tofu. The wrapper was perfect, not too thick and did not fall apart. However the filling seemed almost 95% tofu. I was expecting a bit more veg or shrooms. Each table had soy sauce, black vinegar and chilli oil but the vinegar was not ""tangy"" enough for me and the chilli oil lacked heat. Hopefully they will improve their veggie dumpling."

You know, the type of bright green wakame business that you're more apt to find in a Japanese restaurant. Except it's in reallyIndicative of Japanese cuisine in this form, and is usually bought premade in large frozen blocks, and contains a disturbingly high amount of sugar. So, like, a non-Japanese version of a Japanese salad. In a restaurant serving Chinese dumplings. Served over a bed of spinach greens and mesclun salad, and dressed with a mysterious, white, viscous emulsion, that I can only describe as *ranch dressing*.Dumplings were satisfactory. They did the job. Sadly, the flavours of the filling aren't really discernible, and fall more in the category of ""amorphous beast"" flavour. But fried nicely and satisfying.I'm no lover of the OQLF, but there's also a shocking lack of service in French. On a zéro déchet note, a sad presence of disposable chopsticks, so do bring your own if possible."

We've only ever tried their steamed dumplings but would highly recommend all the different combos. I'm a big fan of the pork and green onion and he swears by the chicken and curry. Everything is made by order and you see them make it in front of you.

They also have a few vegetarian options, out of which I really enjoyed the mushroom and cabbage dumplings. The best part of Le Petit Coin is the super sweet people that work there!"
