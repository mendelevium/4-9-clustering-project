We both shared the kopanisti (good but not great) and each had a chicken souvlaki plate (again, good but not great).Loved the service and kindness of our hostess though!"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lovely place.Last time I cameWas a few years ago still great same taste.Tripoli's salad tho ! Crumbled feta drives me wild they kill the salad.I've never had a bad meal here from the appetizers to the chicken and pitas.Gosh I love you guys They need to put more smaller appetizers because we want to try everything and then we are left with a lot of left overs not a bad idea to have more than less but something to maybe think about.They have a small location but it's perfect for what it is, friendly family oriented spot with a little terasse out front for warm summer nights.I love the cheese love love actually and the Greek salad is out of this world could be because they crumble it so the oil really gets in there. House wine is awesome as well."
/user_details?userid=ZRtzUtX9OEYNHrRI3aS1NA,Allison C.,"Ventura, CA",4 star rating,"Very good greek food at a reasonable price. The spanakopita and cheese balls were amazing and the side salads were huge and delicious. The potatoes that came with the main courses were so good with lemon squeezed on them and the lamb chops were cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that there was very little meat on the chops, i definitely felt there should have been more meat. The restaurant is also cash only! There was only a very small sign in the window when you enter which we did not notice. I believe they really should tell you before you order that it is cash only as we were lucky to have enough cash on us and we would have been charged a lot of fees to use the ATM.  The service was good though and the ambiance was lovely. I can definitely see why this would be a local favorite. Also ordered a small order of the loukoumades which had 19 balls! They were so good! My phone died or i would have taken a photo.Oh and i will say i was a bit disappointed that there was no pastitsio on the menu after seeing a photo of it posted here a year ago on yelp. I love pastitsio!"
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The Shelbyville of Greek restos in the area.for me.I've eaten at Marven's a block away about 3 to 400 times, and Tripoli  maybe once in 15 years, but more often in the last 10.I ordered it once many years ago and was let down by the potatoes,(homemade slices, simply fried) and the souvlaki stick (No Pita, I repeat, no Pita).I swore them off for about 15 years, but finally can appreciate them for what they can offer that Marven's and others can't. Sort of like a ying and yang.Marven's does the best messy pita, toasted bread and fries with sauce.They do rib steaks and salads better than anywhere else.Their fries are still second rate and the meat is not as savory,but the chicken has a golden color and it has a succulent soft texture.I got the Pikilia plate for takeout recently and was a bit underwhelmed, the vines leaves were not fresh and the items all mixed up in the bowl.Overall, the fact that they are open late is a big plus for me and will keep going back to get the faves. Their prices are also very decent here."
/user_details?userid=ycA0ia5jKLWsVg3JaBRajQ,Danie R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We had a pikilia for 2 and an order of fried calimari.The pikilia had high and low points.  The tzaziki acceptable but seemed to have been scooped from a pre-made container.some cucumbers to lighten it up Ahmed more garlic maybe would make it feel more authentic. The taramosalata was nice as was the olive spread. The pickled herring was smokey but drenched in canola oil as was the whole dish. Some beans straight from a can was also thrown in there. Olive would have been better.The stuffed vine leafs were horribly dry and tasted very very old. It was actually hard!The calimari was clearly from a frozen pre battered ready made. The fish came with no sauce or dip. It was palatable and slightly seasoned.  Again I have nothing against pre made but at least customise it, maybe make a house seasoning and a dipping sauce I don't know but try.At 16.50 and 17.00 this is over prices or under quality.Service was excellent waitress was attentive and kind terrasse was small but very pleasant to sit out on."

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been desperately wanting to try out Tripolis for some time now and I finally had the opportunity to do so last night. Walking in, you get the already mentioned no-frills, dated decor, a small place that still manages to get a warm and homely feeling to it that puts right you at ease. We were seated immediately and given menus. We went with the tzatziki, tripolis feta salad, Greek sausages, saganaki, and their tripolis chicken & potatoes as well as their dessert.... the loukoumades.The Good :The tzatziki was good though I'll admit I've had better, the side bread was really good. The tripolis feta salad was very good, though extremely oily. The Greek sausages were fantastic and probably the best I've ever eaten in my life. The loukoumades was very good as well but a bit more honey dressing would have been appreciated.The Bad : The saganaki felt completely off. It really didn't taste like the saganaki I know and love. It was soggy and looked like it was microwaved before serving to us. Usually if it were pan-seared, or oven convected it'll look completely different and the speed it was provided leans towards to former rather than the latter. The tripolis chicken & potatoes were disappointing as well. I've had amazing Greek chicken in my life and this simply wasn't there. As our main course, we couldn't even finish eating it. It was decent but quite forgettable. The potatoes were decent. Many dishes needed a lot of salt.The service was very odd. My waiter wasn't very friendly and my wife felt he was blunt with us even though we ordered right away. Not a ""how are you?"" ""is this your first time here?"" etc... the kind of talk usually small places like this tend to lean on to build a rapport with their patrons. Most of our food came right away, from the moment we ordered the tzatziki was provided within 3 minutes, quickly followed by the feta salad. Great start! Then the saganaki was surprisingly quickly served which was odd and the sausages followed a few minutes later. The chicken was provided 15 minutes later. So all in all, very quick service. When we ordered the loukoumades, it suddenly took over half an hour to get them.I dislike being the harshest review to this Yelp darling resto but my experience was somewhat different than the norm. I love Greek cuisine and I'm a regular to a handful of them that already satisfy me. Yet I wanted to try a new experience and all in all, it didn't hold up anywhere close to what I already had. One outstanding item of the menu was the Greek sausages but the rest doesn't measure up. Add to this a server with a service that left to be desired, the long wait for a dessert or the fact you can't pay by debit or credit card (CASH ONLY??? It's 2014 people! People don't walk around with wads of cash anymore) forcing me to pay a few bucks of ""transaction fees"" (a first in nearly a decade)...The price-tag is about average.All in all, I'm happy I ate here, the few things I really liked stood out but overall my experiences have been better elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=hud1Qiluxk1A7XpxEww1WQ,Carlos E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I've had the Moussaka and the chicken souvlaki. Both times I got a good and healthy portion. I also had the fried calamari. Not as good as the one I had at Marven's (a few blocks away) but still decent.
/user_details?userid=SUd0Gwv8dg6x2oUSy4lgVQ,Will R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the best Greek I have had in Montreal, except for the really pricy stuff like Milos or Cava. That said it is a wonderful price point for super high quality food. They clearly read reviews because every dish that has received complaints historically is now perfect. The chicken is succulent, the salad is perfectly seasoned and the staff are attentive! We had the octopus, chicken brochettes, salad, fried eggplant/zucchini and the calamari. The latter was unique in cut, lightly battered, perfectly tender and I would recommend strongly."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Wes is right, this place is just as authentic, delicious, fresh and homey as you could possibly wish for. A friend and I wandered in here on a tip from a neighbor who said all the Greeks in the city love Tripoli. We only ordered pikilias for two and wine. For $15 we were served a small mountain of incredibly fresh taramousalata, homemade vine leaves, tzaziki. pickled fish, fresh real lovely crab, roast eggplant spread, beets and beans, all so profoundly good we nearly licked the plate. We were packed full from just this appetizer and the lovely dry Greek wine, but she and I are already making plans to go back, bring dates, celebrate birthdays here in the future. The staff, especially Maria, were friendly, funny and utterly kind and charming, but with food that exceptional they good have whipped the bread at our heads and laughed at us in Greek and it would still be 5 stars from me."
/user_details?userid=1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,Wes N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yelpers ~ you've been missing out! Atmosphere, Service, and Food galore here!!! Come one, Come All, Just Come!Atmosphere: Fact - Tropolis is as authentic as you can possibly have.  Literally Mom & Pop owned, it's located on a quite unassuming street in the Parc Extention part of Montreal.  Tripolis is small - but has a big heart.  The decor is somewhat dated, but still functional, but the real attraction is the people.  Take a seat and watch as literally the community comes in for a bite to eat.  Very very family oriented - it is not strange to get caught up listening to a family near by laugh and enjoy each other's company.  Going there can feel like having lunch or dinner at Grandma's house.  Love it.Service:  The staff, includes the owners of the place.  They've been doing this for well over a decade and this business is their livelihood.  They give you an honest smile and very warm service because that's how they've been doing it.  New staff members, are equally as caring and genuine.  Good people here.Food: Top top marks in all aspects.  It may not be the healthiest of cuisines (Saganaki anyone?) But it's so well cooked - you'll come back for more without having any reason to.  Lamb chops, calamari, octopus, pork chops, grilled chicken are all on the menu.  Salads and appetizers too, plus a nice little wine list.  Cannot say enough, how good this place is.  Been going there with family for years. Love it."

No it's not fancy and the staff will speak loudly greek to one another, regulars and the tv (that obviously is on Greek channels). AND THATS AWESOME.Food : nothing short of delicious. I've tasted many things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The wine comes in the little tins and the Greek coffee is always good.Decor : simple. No frills. A couple of cute greek paintings here and there.Service : I love the waitress (I have not asked permission to mention her name). She's so nice and attentive.This place is a hidden gem.I would give it 5* but I'm not a fan of the lighting (but that's just me!)"
/user_details?userid=LMaU1eIPujKxtG9wGtIomg,Tim F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really really good food. Id suggest the potatoes over the rice.  The pork was juicy and to die for. Suggest ordering a second stick to eat at home the next day.  Generous portions. Best on class.
/user_details?userid=k2qyzc1yQc6UppJLKDCHCg,Stella O.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"Want to have authentic Greek food in a crowded, but laid-back, place where the manager and waiters are friendly and bubbly? Then Tripolis is the spot! You do get the vibe that this is a mom-and-pop restaurant, but a very popular one at that. When I was there, families and groups of 4+ came in every 15-20 minutes. Greek salad, the way they make it here, is the best I've had in forever. It's massive and the vegetables are cut up in huge chunks, giving you the sensation (if you're not vegetarian nor vegan) that having one dish of salad here is equivalent to the recommended quantity of vegetables you need for a week. (I'm eating a Greek salad I made at home while typing this, but I still crave Tripolis' Greek salad). The calamari was nice. It was succulent, fried to the right pitch, and each piece was very chewy. Just the way I like it. But I have had better calamari in my hometown. Still, it was worth the money and the long metro ride just for a dining experience here. Like the salad, the calamari plate was massive! (Anyone who has a big appetite seriously needs to go to a Greek restaurant more often.)   My date paid for me, but I think the average price for a dinner plate is around $18-20. There are side dishes included. Not too sure what they were (I last dined here in mid-February). Whatever they were, they were delicious too. There's an elderly man, whom I presume is either the owner or top manager by the way he interacts with the staff and customers, who offered to have me seated at the back, beside the kitchen, because he didn't want me to wait too long standing up. The kitchen staff was loud and very talkative, but I liked that."

/user_details?userid=wzKfslO4jr4HTSWREMWj0Q,Alex H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I found it difficult to encounter GOOD greek cuisine in Montreal for a decent price. So many cheap and greasy restaurants that serve americanized greek foods (gyros soaked in mayonnaise, ew). Then came Tripolis!The food is authentic, the servings are more than generous, the atmosphere is casual and fun, and the house wine is pretty good. Plus, you won't have to pay an arm and leg to eat there. Really fair prices. I highly recommend this restaurant over places such as Merven's and Aharova (which are, in my opinion, terrible).Now get yourself to the Greek and try Tripolis! Alex"

The Greek salad is surprisingly unique and certainly the best in town in my opinion. I was actually impressed it surpassed milos and mythos ones! Shrimps are huge and good, lamb chops... Well everything we had was good. I over ate. Your meal always comes with potatoes (yummy ones) and the -amazing- greek salad. There is a small terrace at the front. Portions are generous. Service was ok, but hey, you go there for the food. Excellent value!"

It takes an experience on either end of the spectrum to get me to take the time.  That being said, this place was AWESOME!  I felt like I was in my Greek Friends Kitchen!  And in truth, by the end of the meal.. I WAS!   And the FOOD...OMG the food.....  I will probably be dreaming about that octopus for a long time.... the lamb ribs ROCKED. Actually everything down to the scrumptious Tripolois Tomato Salad and simple fried potatoes ,was to die for.  After the meal our waiter Nick suggested Greek Honey Balls, being Italian myself, I thought they were similar to struffoli,  NOPE!  They were more like round balls of Zeppoli hot from the fryer and dipped in honey.  WOW!  We thought we were full when this heaping plate was placed in front of us...  I learned there is always room for jello and HONEY BALLS!  Dont miss this wonderful Greek Gem!"

/user_details?userid=DRVEe9OZqBox9iWgFyB8SA,Krista M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm a HUGE Greekophile and have eaten at a plethora of Greek restaurants in Montreal - Philinos, Rotisserie Panama, Greek Village, Elatos, Marvens, Souvlaki George, to name a few...Stepping into Tripolis today I was sincerely smiling from ear to ear. The mark of an authentic (and delicious) Greek restaurant can often be measured by the number of old Greek men sitting on the front patio. It was full!While we went straight for Risa D's favorite of wine and cold pikilia plate for 2 (normally I'm not keen on the eggplant dip but this one was unlike any other I've had...smokey, light, perfect). This was a light, dreamy meal for two! I'm SO happy to have discovered this neighborhood haunt. Their list of mezes was impressive and very reasonably priced, the mains equally so and judging from the freshness of the crabmeat and the salty goodness of the smoked mackerel I'm guessing their fish dishes would be satisfying indeed. The souvlaki plates looked enticing as did the calamari which many tables seemed to be ordering. The drink list was equally impressive with a solid selection of Greek wine/beer and a nice, inexpensive house wine.The owners and all the staff were warm and friendly and the service was unobtrusive but attentive. My only question was...do they have live music? I'll have to go back to find out...Cash only."
/user_details?userid=5iEOPO3hATdAzviRCfkRVg,Steve H.,"Navarre, FL",3 star rating,"This is a small neighborhood restaurant strong with locals. We ordered wine to start and spanakopita. The spanakopita was more soft and less crispy than others we have had. The chicken souvlaki was tender, moist n flavorful. The pork souvlaki was less flavorful. House potatoes are strictly thinly sliced potatoes ...add some salt. Greek or Tripoli salad was good .. also add some salt. The restaurant is in a multicultural neighborhood that isn't on main travel routes. A few blocks from Parc metro stop. Service was friendly and prompt. Small deck to seat at outside if you are able to grab one. Still deserves a visit to try the rest of their menu options."

My partner and i remarked on how delicious the house wine was, so I asked our waitress what it was, expecting to discover a new affordable bottle of greek wine at the saq later on in the week, but she told us it was Yecla.  :/ I will go back to try some of their other dishes."
/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"When you walk in, you feel like this might be a bad idea and like this restaurant is a ""bit"" outdated, but the second the food gets served - all those worries get washed away. First, I'd like to mention how hospitable and accommodating the waitress was. She warned us that we may be ordering too much and to stick to the first few choices we had asked for. So we trusted her and were more than grateful that she had been paying attention to us! Their portions are massive and very filling. She also took the time to explain how everything was cooked and how authentic they were in comparison to other Greek restaurants. Check, check, and check!They quite possibly make the best calamari I have ever had. They're fresh, big pieces, and the batter isn't overpowering. Also, we ordered a mix of fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki on the side, which was delicious. The one thing I didn't enjoy very much was the chicken brochette that came with their traditional Greek salad on the side. Although the chicken was soft and tender, I just didn't like the way it tasted, I suppose the marinade just didn't appeal to me very much. However, the salad was delicious, the feta cheese came sprinkled rather than in chunks and tasted phenomenal."

Omg I never seen a rude person like her , I ask for a bread after 15 min I reminded her about the bread one more time  she gives me a look and says COMING she never smiles unless she knows you. I am sitting with my family and observing her to see if she is rude to everyone , to most of the customers she was serving with  same attitude unhappy and  unpleasant facial expression not a smile or affection ( not even a FAKE smile ) unless another Greek person who comes in and she somehow knows that person and she welcomes them with a big smile by saying oooooo TIKANIS  and she gives 2 big kiss on there face. My point is this woman can turn your family outing to a disaster and makes you feel that you are not welcomed to this establishment , she is not professional enough to work in this little cute  reputable family  restaurant . I Don't need to inform my yelper  friends or whoever might read my reviews about the food here because there is nothing to review , because they are the best Greek restaurant in Montreal . Myself and my whole family comes here for many years .
