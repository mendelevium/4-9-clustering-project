/user_details?userid=JuzGYnX2zArwZMM-5IhZHQ,Erika D.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was my second time going to this oyster bar. I had initially gone a couple of months ago for oystermania. My first experience was definitely subpar. I had booked Belon for Montreal a table, as I forgot that it already been for oyster mania. However, my second experience here was phenomenal. It seems like they've gotten more organized and they were able to keep up with the demands of the clientele.I will start with the food. Because it was for the set menu of Montreal a table, I had very specific dishes available from the kitchen. The choices were actually really good ranging from oyster Rockefellers to salmon tartare to octopus to fish and a variety of desserts. You could also order from the cold bar. They had around 6 to 7 different varieties of oysters. The food was extremely well executed well presented and really delicious. I had the salmon tartare as a starter and then the octopus with pearl couscous and finally the brownie. I highly highly recommend the octopus and the brownie.The service was a lot better than during my first visit. They were very attentive and your water was always being filled. The waiters are very friendly. And because we sat at the oyster bar we saw the oyster shuckers and they were very friendly. It did get busy but they were able to keep up with everyrhing and they were very quick at delivering orders. It just goes to show that sometimes you need to give restaurants a second try!!"

Even though the weather wasn't favorable, a dozen oysters and a drink were sure to please. We got inside and were told to go upstairs and wait in line. I have never been so disappointed with management- over a 30 minute wait (which was generous in my time) there was no one from the the restaurant to check up on us. Even though we were a party of two, I asked the hostess if we could be seated as there were still empty seats on the second floor. She said it wouldn't be long and disappeared on us.I insisted on leaving until my friend said we were being seated at the downstairs bar. We waited another  20 minutes until we will were actually served a glass of wine, and then another 20 mins for our oysters. Honestly, felt like were were kids waiting for lunch to be served by a cafeteria lady! I think it was also really upsetting to see how one of the waitresses started yelling at the staff members because he served 24 instead of 12 oysters, she lost it on him. Completely unprofessional, when there are clients around. Apparently there was confusion on the restaurant's end as they were over booked through bookenda and opentable. I dine a lot and this experience was a mad house experience for the books. Thank God for Tiraditio across the street!"

We went for the lunch menu offering 25$ table d'hôte which I coudes appetizers, main and dessert. Honestly, the soup was delicious and flavourful and the tartare was fresh. We skipped on dessert sadly. Great price and good portions for lunch. Only thing I didn't like was the overpriced screw tap white wine which was 60$. Ouch!!! But would still recommend the restaurant!"

/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Beautiful spot that I didn't even know existed until I seen it on oyster mania. Let me start off with saying that the place is gorgeous from the decor to the layout of the building to the people. When you first walk in you will have to go up two flights of stairs where you will walk in to large raw bar and plenty of people sitting around having a good time. It looks a bit like big in Japan with the counters and everyone sitting close and cozy next to one another.I called for a reservation earlier in the day and was showed to my seat by a well dressed man in a great suit who was very polite asking if the table he picked out for us was good and it was perfect. We were taken upstairs where it's a little less loud and mostly booths and a little bar in the back which overlooked the raw bar downstairs.We had a great waiter who offered us our drinks which came with our oysters away we chose the white wine and since it was so good we got a second glass later on for when our oysters arrived. I had an old fashion that was made with love perfectly mixed and brought to me in a beautiful glass just how I like it. My boyfriend got the mai thai It tasted great but it wasn't your traditional one but again it was made with so much love the bartender did a great job.I've had a lot of oysters in my life but these were by far my favourite! They were delicious and out of this world. I'm not sure exactly which ones I had but they were big and fresh and nice and cold we couldn't stop talking about how great they were. We got the calamari that came with a garlic spicy mayo and grilled lemon and the fish tacos. Both were done so well and packed with a lot of flavour. The fish tacos has guacamole and sweet corn in it so it really makes ur taste buds pop.100% recommend this place for a romantic night out a business meeting or a night out with friends they have a great crowd and the staff is wonderful.

The wine selection by the glass is sparse, unfortunately.  We both liked the Valpolicella, even though we planned to have some seafood. To start, we had the calamari which was delicate and tender with the perfect amount of breading and nice slightly spicy sauce.  Make sure to squeeze the lemon over the dish because that acidity really balances it out.For main courses, we had the Lobster BLT and the Mussels and Clams with Frites.  They were both very, very delicious.  The BLT featured a generous portion of lobster on fresh focaccia with a smear of tomato relish and tarragon aioli.  The broth for the mussel and clam bucket was phenomenal with tomato vodka sauce and fresh herbs with some fennel (I think).  I sopped up as much as I could with the two charred pieces of focaccia bread they provided and some if the frites!  The vibe is chill with some decent music and beautiful romantic lighting and embellishments."

Got the lunch hour special oysters - not sure the name - but they were really average. I'm from San Francisco so I know a good oyster (and was blown away by the oysters at Larry's). The lobster bisque was very good and the fish and chips is solid too - more like a cod tempura. Good staff, outdated decor, overpriced."

First of all, the atmosphere was just great. Dimmed lights, fantastic music at a perfect volume, and a cozy location had already uplifted me. Then, the food was just exquisite! I tried seal tartar for the first time and was pleasantly surprised, especially that I'm not the biggest fan of tartars. The chef definitely did a great job at pairing flavors in this dish. I also tried the crispy tuna - oh my lord. Again, the amalgamation of flavors were incredible! Yes, prices are substantially high, but you pay for quality."

Oysters.Stopped in here during that odd time between lunch and dinner for an adult beverage and some oysters. Good call.The layout of Belon is very cool and somewhat whimsical-especially the restrooms. (The entrances of the restrooms look like port-a-potties...pretty funny). Everything is super clean and they make the most out of the space that they have. It's two levels with the regular and raw bars on the lower floor.The raw bar is lovely and everything is obviously super fresh. We sampled oysters from both Canada and the US. We relaxed, enjoyed our beverages and oysters until we decided to move on to the next thing. The staff that assisted us were fabulous - especially out primary server (an adorable, young local gentleman that we really enjoyed chatting with).I would definitely visit Belon again and stay for a main course next time."

From the initial phone call asking about reservations all the way through dinner, he was amazing. The oysters were outstanding. And the description of each different oyster was spot on. The ambiance was perfect for a date night. Music, lighting, and even a tv broadcasting a fireplace !!! If I had any negative things to say it was the size (or lack there of) of the risotto main dish. Tasted great but very small portion for the cost. Overall, you get a perfect night out to dinner but you will be paying for it. Enjoy !"

Oh boy were we disappointed. The food was pretty ok. Very fresh seafood. Very pricey for the quantity. We had the raw seafood platter for 2, the octopus, the fried seafood plate and the fish of the day. It was good, but that's all i can say about it. As for the service, my friends and I didn't have a good time there. There were so many free tables in the restaurant but they just had to sit us at the bar. We were 4 and it was hard to talk to everyone. The waiter was a bit rude and kept interrupting our conversations. He didn't have a smile on his face and wasn't friendly at all. He also made us go to the cash register to pay while some other tables had their bills brought to them. For a place this expensive, i would expect the service to be better. I don't think I would come back as there are so many other good seafood places which are cheaper and with a much better service."

Therefore she is on the list! Despite being on the list, the hostesses made us wait about 30 minutes. There was some kind of bad management somewhere since it is the first day of the new season of oysters, and plus restomania has been offering deals. The restaurant got confused and they were placing media and ticket holders upstairs but it was supposed to be only media to be upstairs. It was becoming frustrating of their mismanagement and the wait; my friend decided to leave, but the hostess was feeling bad, and she placed us by the bar on the main floor. Alex, restomania manager came by to see us, he got confused how come we were not placed upstairs right away. It was complete mess. He apologized few times! At the bar, the service was pretty long. At this point, I was dying of hunger. I got my glass of white wine then it took forever to get our oysters. I know the restaurant had mismanaged with reservations, tickets holders and media. Everyone was running around. Even between staff, we witnessed some little spats. Honestly, the vibe wasn't pleasant. The mismanagement was frustrating and long service was painful. But the silver lining in this is that the oysters were super delicious!"

The interior design was beautiful along with the bathroom which looked like a porta potty but once you walk in it's a beautiful marbled design and cute!! We were sat immediately and the table was comfortable and big enough to fit a party of 12 people. Our waiter was very helpful and gave us excellent service. My boyfriend and I ordered a dozen of their oysters and it was delicious! We had different varieties (east and west coast) styled. I ordered their clams and mussels and it came with fries. The mussels were pretty small but I didn't mind it so much, but the clams were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the risotto and that was also good. The risotto came with shrimp, scallop, squid, clam, and mussels. The risotto had a tomato flavor to it but I enjoyed the food.Overall, my experience and food was nice. I recommend to anyone that's looking for a date spot because it was very intimate."

We arrived with a reservation and they did not have two seats available for us right away.  Instead of shooing us to the side they offered us two drinks while we waited. The ambiance was swanky, and the place was packed, but it wasn't super loud. We were seated shortly after our drinks were delivered. We ordered two Belon Platters as well as several platters. The oysters were delicious. They were a lot more briny than I am used to (I like my New Orleans Oysters), but they were delicious. All of the appetizers were delicious as well. If you are looking for a perfect date night spot, this is it."

She was more than happy to offer taking off a drink order due to an allergen I have. Style of the restaurant: Modern accents of wood and curved tables to accommodate for larger groups. The restaurant wasn't huge, so it provided a more intimate environment. There was also a small outdoor seating area as well. Bilevel; upstairs is better for a quiet dinner, whereas downstairs is louder and more bar-like.Food: The food was good, and well presented. They had run of the lava cake so we all had to split the last one *we tried to be civil 0:)*. They offered seafood, lobster, duck, chicken, and steak, etc. Pricing: $$-$$$"

I found the oysters a little bit too salty for my liking,their spicy sauce was interesting thoughThe decoration and ambiance of the place is really nice.good vibes,classy but not too much.Took a salmon tartare, it came with 3 pieces of bread. S little small in quantity but tasted fresh.The lobster blt was yummy, but the bread was a bit soggy with oil. The amount of lobster was minimal as well. The fries that came with it was a nice touch because it was seanoned differentlyFinally the clams and mussels platter was okay  and nothing too special.it came with a side of fries.Had a lovely evening there because of the company i was with.

We went for lunch at around 12:30, and they weren't ""sold out"", they just didn't have it even though it's on the menu. So cmon....I was BAITED so hard.Well anyways, since we already ordered a drink and appetizer, we kinda had to stay.First of all, the restaurant atmosphere is modern and chic. High ceilings and glass walls with lots of natural light. There was a raw bar with lots of fresh seafood on ice. The seating area is a long bendy table so you might make accidental eye contact with the strangers across from you. In terms of food, i wanted to get oysters but I just couldn't bring myself to. They offered a platter of 6 oysters for about $30 and that's just too expensive (even though they might be really good idk)We got a large clam chowder to share and they played it separately for us, which was a very thoughtful touch. The soup was full of ingredients and the flavour was excellent. Next, I got the fish tacos which were excellent as well. Fried fish, guac, coleslaw, and jalapeños. My friend got the salmon tartare along with a salad.For dessert, I got a lemon meringue jar. It was a lucky pick because our server couldn't explain it in English so I said ""okay I'll try this lemon thing you speak of"". Thankfully, it was delicious. The food was good, but it's overpriced. It was $7 for flat water, because we didn't ask specifically for ""tap"" :( Probably wouldn't come again but MAN I wanted to try that mac n cheese."

They have funny looking bathrooms that startled me at first. It feels like you're going into these bathroom booths at the circus but when you pull the door its super fancy inside. They have a very pretty terasse outside on the second floor during the summer time. They have a very fancy Raw seafood bar with a chef in the centre preparing the platter for you.The service: it was phenomenal. You need to make table reservations in advance because it get very packed every so often and the best is to play it safe and book in advance for a good table. The waiters/&waitresses were super friendly and kind. They were very attentive and made sure to get everything we wanted quickly. I am very happy with that!The Food: oh ma goodness !!! It was the bestttt part! Their food is so mouthwatering! We went for their raw seafood platter for 2. It came with almost everything you could think of! Shrimp, scallops,crab,sea urchin, caviar, clams, mussels,OYSTERSSSSSSSS did i forget to mention the OYSTERSSSS! Wow everything was delicious and FRESH! having fresh raw seafood is key! I loved it soo much! We even ordered main platter as if the huge seafood platter was not enough ahaha.

/user_details?userid=SWvQEKCO1YRbLlHEGPZvoA,Tim K.,"Ridgewood, NJ",4 star rating,"We booked a reservation in advance of our arrival in Montreal - the reviews and the allure of oysters sealed the deal. We showed up at the time of our reservation and were seated - at our request at the bar. The large circular bar is right in the middle of the action and you can see the fresh oysters, crab, scallops and lobsters piled up on ice waiting to devoured. We ordered drinks and ordered a half dozen each of three (of 5 or 6) different types of oysters, some PEI, some Maine and some Massachusetts. All were beautifully shucked and presented with freshly ground horseradish and a delicious mignonette. But the oysters needed neither as they were fresh, bright and briny perfection. For our main course we ordered seafood risotto, which had mussels, clams, lobster, scallops, shrimp & octopus...About twenty minutes after we finished our oysters the gentleman who had been waiting on us was getting pulled in all directions and it began to dawn on us he had no one to manage the incoming deluge of people (it was Saturday night). When he could finally break away he informed us that the kitchen was SLOW and he couldn't tell us how long it might take us to get our risotto, but if we would wait he would pick up a round of drinks. We said no problem- we were having a fine time. Probably another half hour later, dinner arrived! It was THE BEST seafood risotto I've ever had. They wood grilled the seafood - it had just the right char and then it was topped on the delicious risotto, with some of it mixed in.Probably another 20 minutes went by after we finished before anyone was able to get to us. We settled up and left - because by then the place was packed and we'd have been there all night. I highly recommend Belon, but they lose a star for the slow service."

Although it was on the pricier side for a NYE menu in Montreal, there were many options to choose from for each course, and all of us were quite satisfied with our meal.I had the salad, seared scallops (a bit cold but delicious) and halibut filet which was the highlight for me. Had also the chance to taste the lobster bisque (too fishy), tuna tartare (amazing!) and lobster ravioli (perfectly creamy and very generous). The chocolate cake dessert was too salty. Service was cold and dare I say a bit unprofessional. Our group extended a few minor requests during the night or had questions about seating and menu options and every time we received condescending answers. Restaurant design is quite modern and beautiful. Although Notkins' location is unusual, the glass cube-like windows and modern interior make you instantly forget that you're surrounded by office buildings.Overall I would recommend this restaurant for seafood only (their specialty) but avoid coming in with a large party and sit at the bar to enjoy better service."
/user_details?userid=rcOADMkAtCLRCN39LvxZLw,Soms O.,"Lynnwood, WA",1 star rating,"Probably the worst service I've ever had. It was actually pretty impressive how poorly our party of ten were treated over three hours on Saturday. I would recommend everyone avoid this place until they get new management.About a month ago, I made a reservation for ten people for my brother's bachelor party at Belon for 8:30p on a Saturday night. During the day, they called me to ask if they could change my reservation to 9p because they were going to be really busy that night. Weird but that's fine. Changed it to 9p. When we showed up at 9p, our table wasn't ready and there only seemed to be one server working in the busy restaurant. We sat at the bar for about 20 minutes while they prepared our table. The bartender never stopped by but whatever, sometimes places are busy. We finally sat down at the table and the server, Katheryn, thanked us for our patience and said she was going to get us shots. Nice! She then got all the drink orders and disappeared for about 30 minutes. No menus were on the table. The manager, a man clearly overwhelmed by a 75% full restaurant on a weekend night, came by and said he would get us menus right away. He recommended some $300 surf and turf platters and said he would be right back with the menus. Didn't see him again for an hour or so. Katheryn came by with some of our drinks and about six menus for the table to share. I decided to get the Captain's Platter of seafood for the group. It's listed as market price on the menu so I asked her how much it was. She said $185 and I ordered it. It looked great.The restaurant started clearing out and was only about 25% full by the time our food came an hour later. As bad as the service was, the food was the opposite. Great food and presentation. Unfortunately, two members of our party who had waited two hours to eat never had their orders put in. They said ""Don't worry, we'll get your steak on and it will be out quick."" The member of our party that didn't get food responded with, ""I've seen your version of quick, no thanks."" The manager begged (it started getting pathetic) to get him something to eat. My friend wasn't having it so the manager offered to fill his beer which my friend agreed to. When Katheryn dropped checks, I noticed the Captain's Platter I ordered came in at $284. When I asked her about it, she said, ""Oh yes. I told you $185 but it was actually $284. Sorry."" Dude, what? I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was that much. The sickly-looking manager came over to ask what happened and I just ended up paying for it so I didn't have to talk to him anymore.Oh and my friend got charged $12 for the free refill the manager gave him on his beer. Katheryn never came back with the shots she had promised earlier but honestly that was pretty low on the problems list. Also the bar ran out of all whiskey by 10p on a Saturday night. The service is so bad I would advise to avoid this place at all costs. It's a shame because the food was great (if you actually get any)."

/user_details?userid=2vKPIXEFrtqZc8zIWvA4tw,MaryJane R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was pretty disappointed with our experience. Things started off well - we were seated in the bar area of the restaurant, which is actually very comfortable and the way it is set up, makes it easy to have a face to face conversation. I loved the airy feel to the place and the overall decor. It gives off a very classy yet trendy vibe.The food was just kinda basic. This is what we got:1. half a dozen of the east oysters - not really tasty. But tbf, it's May, so what do you expect?2. two orders of the salad with miso vinaigrette - quite refreshing3. salmon tartar - nothing remarkable. A-OK4. Mussels - no complaints from my friend, but no raves either5. scallop risotto - again no complaints from my friend, but he didn't seem to love it (again tbf, he isnt the biggest fan of seafood, but this dish didn't convert him either)5. Clam bake (my hubby and I got this) - since I ate this, I have more to say. The dish came with several big shrimp and a smaller size whole lobster and a generous portion of mussels and clams, but not really enough to feed 2 people for dinner. But they serve this dish with a whole lot of sausage, corn,potatoes and bread, so that in the end, you're really eating more corn than seafood and feel full. For $110, that's not really a good deal.In addition, I was disappointed with the seafood options. They actually didn't have many. I was planning on getting the fish of the day before going there, but it was salmon! I don't go to a seafood place to have salmon. That's legit the only thing I can make at home and can find in any grocery. I was hoping for something more exotic. Finally, the service was really hit or miss. At the beginning, when there weren't a lot of customers, we received a lot of attention, but towards the end of the night, when the place got more crowded, it was hard to get our waiter's attention. But that's okay. Also, although the waiter wasn't too pushy about it, there was a *slight* tendency for him to market relatively more expensive items on the wine and food list. Wouldn't go back again."

The design is pretty nice. The washroom is really unique. When you first look at the washroom door you would think that the washroom was actually a porta potty. But when you enter, you'd be surprised. It was not what you were expecting. It was just a regular washroom. It had a marble like interior and was extremely clean. Nice design. As for food, we were only able to order oyster and a few appetizers from the bar menu. The oysters here were fresh and tasty but the pricing was way overpriced compared the Toronto. The lobster bisque was ok. The salmon tartare was pretty good but they didn't give enough crackers. They only gave two pieces, It was not enough for the salmon. You'd end up eating the salmon by itself. As for the services, the shuckers were really friendly and nice. However, the waiters were not so much. Their service wasn't that great yet they demand you tip them to their expectations which was 20%. Um.. tip is optional. Will not be coming back."

What do you get at a seafood spot? Seafood. I ordered the clam and mussel pot approx $30cad. It's an actual bucket, like tin bucket. And I ate every freaking one and soaked the bread in the lobster sauce at the bottom. Bartender who resembled Celine Dion, was really polite and attentive. My boyfriend got the lobster burger with chunks of fresh lobster and home fries, by the time she set it down and turned around it was gone. $28 cad was well spent. But here's the kicker. The decor is very open and dare I even say... sexy. Then you go to the bathroom and walk through what looks like a port-a-potty, minus the tissue sticking to your foot and atrocious smell. The speakeasy of bathrooms actually leads you to a stunning bathroom . Music is at that perfect ambient temperature and staff is friendly. So stop yelping, grab your date and have fun."
/user_details?userid=RTtdNQrhqbcGPARn2A2ifw,Peng L.,"Rosemont, IL",4 star rating,"During one of those days after Christmas and before New Year, we went to the Notkins. Like its cuisine the restaurant's large windows and silver color decor bore a similar style of clarity and simplicity. Oysters are said to taste differently depending on the season of the year--holiday is often a good time! We tried the oyster lunch special and chef's choice, which included all three kinds of oysters the place carried at the time: the south lake tasted more chewy and woody; the caribou was juicy and tender, with a fresh coolness that really satisfy the palate; and the copps island was much larger in size, rich and creamy. The last kind was from Connecticut, U.S., while the other two from Canada. Personally, I favor the caribou. Two interesting details would add to your experience of the oysters. If you sit at the oyster bar, they will carve open the oyster in front of you. They use a dropper for chili sauce, so you can easily manage how much to put in. The lobster burger had been well recommended on yelp thus we ordered one to try. It was a small burger with a large basket of potato chips. The portion of lobster filling was adequate and fresh, but the meat also contained quite a bit from the tip of the claw, the part that I did not quite enjoy. The sauce is creamy, rich and very tasty. The least likable part of the burger was its bread--a bit oily and cheaply made, not much difference from that of the Wendy's burgers."

Chose this spot to celebrate, before heading back to the airport. Ordered the following:- Gulf shrimps- Surf clams- Princess scallops- Sea urchin- Lobster- Mujjol caviar- PEI OystersI had to fight the urge to reschedule my flight just so that I could come back here for dinner. And lunch. And then dinner again. Gulf shrimps were big and succulent. Surf Clams and Princess Scallops were full of flavor, as were the Lobster and PEI Oysters. But what really stole the show for me were the Sea Urchin with mince cucumber and Mujjol Caviar. If for some inexplicable reason, you can only order 2 dishes off the menu, order the Sea Urchin and Mujjol Caviar. Your taste buds will thank you. The staff were very professional, courteous and very friendly. The ambience provides a perfect backdrop for a business lunch, an intimate dinner, or a group celebration of sorts. I'm now at the airport and hungry again, but how do you top the likes of Sea Urchin and Mujjol Caviar? One can't. One has to go hungry and savor the everlasting flavors in one's mouth from the epic meal at Notkins. Thank you Notkins for graciously feeding me and indulging me in intelligent, culinary banter.

It's clearly been recycled from the previous day or days.   The waitress acted concerned when our seafood platter was unfinished and we explained that we could not eat it because it was such poor quality.  But nothing was removed from our bill nor offered to be removed from our bill, which was outrageously high.  We had extremely high quality seafood around the city at reasonable prices.  This restaurant is such a disappointment.  If this were my restaurant, I would feel embarrassed 1.  For the poor quality of food and 2.

The food was fresh and pretty good but I've had comparable at a less expensive restaurant. The fries were natural cut and not the crispy kind. In fact some were limp, so don't order them if you're not into limp fries. The service was really slow. Our waiter seemed bored and was not able to offer much when we asked for suggestions. He was not attentive to our needs. They seated us near the part of the bar where the staff was shucking oysters and we were gifted with one or two flicks of oyster juice, not to mention a bad view. It was an unpleasant experience. Wine helped us get through it."

/user_details?userid=lL4sVOfmnrrwUDYW9lAilw,Niran A.,"Baltimore, MD",5 star rating,"Notkins was a really good find. First, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful - very chic and modern with its use of glass and wood everywhere. The oyster and raw bar in the middle of the restaurant adds authenticity to the restaurant and their oyster display was clearly very fresh.Being our last meal, we went a bit wild and ordered almost everything on the menu - quite literally. We actually didn't get any oysters or items from the raw bar, but the fact that everything we got was so good shows that Notkins isn't just a one-trick-pony.On this pleasant July evening, we opted to sit outside in their small but beautiful patio area. We started with clam chowder, gazpacho verde, calamari, oyster & kale salad, and salmon tartar. The chowder was as authentic/tasty as chowder you find in New England, but better because you don't have to deal with ""Massholes"". The gazpacho verde was very refreshing, as was the salmon tartar. I really enjoyed the kale Caesar, which was elevated with shaved parmesan and fried oysters. It would have been nice if the salad included at least one more fried oyster, since the two included were so delicious and went fast. The calamari was absolutely perfect. I didn't care for the green papaya salad it includes on the side, but the calamari itself was thick cut rings, perfectly battered and fried, yet still tender - yum. Being quite full from the starters, we calmed ourselves for the mains - ordering just the steak tartar (which is an appetizer), the fish tacos, and the lobster burger. The steak tartar was very good, especially with the 63 degree egg that dressed the dish as you cut into it. The included chips for dipping into the tartar were good, but I would have preferred a sturdier chip to hold the tartar - but that's honestly nitpicking. The fish tacos were also very tasty, with a minimal and clean presentation. The lobster burger was one of the highlights; the patty was essentially a lobster cake with copious amounts of fresh lobster. The cheese surprising worked well and the fluffy bun really made the lobster even more buttery and tasty. The fries were perfection too, so crispy yet meaty with the right amount of salt.Finally, yes the bathrooms at this restaurant are awesome. The 'portapotty' blue entrance door leads to blindingly beautiful white marble everything. It's weird to say, but these bathrooms were honestly gorgeous - the interior reminding you of a high-end Vegas hotel. Lastly, service was very good the entire evening. I would highly recommend Notkins if you're in Montreal."

Maybe.  Price point was a little high for the quality and expectation compared to similar places I have enjoyed the same dish at in various countries.  Would not say it is a value pick...and I say that as someone who doesnt really care about price at all if the quality and taste meets that value."

Nice place, good crowd but honestly it seemed a bit disheveled in some regards - they should just tidy up a bit (note to manager, wipe the dust off the vents over the oyster bar not good seeing very dusty vents over a food prep area).Not being negative, it was fine, but just a little effort it could be very good."

We opted for half a dozen oysters for starters, and the waitress briefly explained how they're all from Canadian sources and complement each other in terms of flavor. Insanely fresh and delicious.Their drink list was short and sweet. Mine came with smoked sage on top, something I hadn't seen in a while, and certainly not on a drink! I was famished, and ordered the Quebec pork chop. It came on a wooden board, on top of braised winter vegetables - gigantic, comforting and beautiful.My boyfriend ordered the lobster mac&cheese and although it looked small in comparison to my giant slab of pork, it turned out to be very satisfying and filling.Desserts were less impressive than the other courses, and significantly smaller in portion. That being said, the sweet potato cheesecake was refreshing and mild. The amble maple pot-de-crème was a little jar of happiness. I admire how well Notkins integrates Canadian products and flavors into its dishes. Blueberries, wild mushrooms, lardon, cheddar... These are the down to earth ingredients shining on Notkin's plates.

That being said you do get what you pay for and Notkins is a delightful and memorable seafood extravaganza that will please even the toughest critics and offers both elegance in ambience and authenticity in its offering. Reviews that mentioned poor service must not have been during times in which the staff were working that served us as our experience was quite the opposite. Service was expedient, friendly, warm, accommodating, and was some of the better service I've received at all levels from our waiter to the shucking staff to the bar backs and bartenders. Every single staff member was working with every table and was paying careful mind of their experience and it showed. The restaurant itself is beautiful and charming, we sat by the oyster shucking station and were visually engaged in the excitement of hundreds of oysters and other shellfish being prepared and beautifully plated for eager guests. We ordered a delicate and fragrant grilled octopus to start which was layered with soft and pleasant flavour notes and textures, as well as a house green salad which was huge ( enough to share for two ) composed with hearty greens topped with a light tart vinaigrette. For dinner my boyfriend got the lobster burger and I ordered the shuckers choice of 12 oysters selected by the oyster shucker artists ( and they absolutely are artists). We both were thrilled at the speed in which our meal was delivered, the question from our waiter on whether or not we wanted to have our meals delivered despite only being partially finished my salad ( it was huge ) this was very insightful and we appreciated the suggestion. The lobster burger was so fantastic I didn't get a chance to try my boyfriend consumed in record speed and looked triumphant, he proclaimed it was the best lobster burger he ever had. The oysters were served by our shucker with a question (""Would you like an explanation?"" - I heartily exclaimed yes please) and plated delicately with house made hot sauce in an eye dropper and lovely house made vinaigrette in a shot glass and lots of fresh lemons. Three types of oysters were explained with various flavour profiles and a suggestion was made as to order to enjoy. It was a sensory experience that is difficult to communicate with words, but the oysters themselves, just phenomenal. Amazing, flavourful, SO FRESH and a symphony of differing yet lovely flavours that I thoroughly enjoyed. We enjoyed a Turkish wine with our meal that reminded me of Portuguese vino verdes and it was a lovely compliment to a phenomenal meal.

Stephen our server was one of the most pleasant and charming people we encountered in our trip.

The raw bar dominates the middle of the main dining room with a nice display of seafood on ice at one end. The other end had swivel chairs on an elevated floor which felt much more comfortable than sitting on bar-height stools, though you don't have as good of a view of the waiters shucking oysters and preparing the beautiful spread of shellfish. Luckily I sat at the middle of the bar with had those chairs while still be able to see a bit of the action of the staff as they were preparing my seafood platter which was nicely presented.My waiter was very nice and attentive, and the two people that prepared my platter did a great job in explaining every shellfish and various sauces on the platter and also assisted in the wait service.I ordered the small seafood platter which was the perfect amount of food for myself for lunch. Everything on the platter was extremely fresh and tasty. A standout was a small mound of smoked caviar which I never had smoked and instantly became a fan. If you want fresh oysters and shellfish Notkins is the place to be and will not disappoint. I had a spicy Caesar with my meal which was the perfect accompliment and it was made just the way I like it. The restrooms upstairs was also cool and fun.Next time I am in Montreal I will be back here for my seafood fix."

We had booked our hotel room but done no other planning. Settled in, pulled up Yelp for a dinner recommendation and had a hard time deciding on one place. We eventually took the path of least resistance and walked ten yards to Notkins. (We were staying at the Marriott Courtyard.)  It wasn't crowded on a Sunday night, and we enjoyed the spaciousness and hip yet comfortable ambiance and decor. We all had the fish tacos (excellent) and we shared a delicious squash salad and a plentiful market garden salad (good thing we like kale!). The cosmos were lovely (though ""too dark pink"" for one in our party).  The check was big considering how modest we were with our ordering (hooray for the US-Canadian exchange rate!), but we felt that we'd gotten our money's worth. And you can't beat the walk home!One tip: You'll want to check out the restrooms. The entrances look like turquoise port-a-potties, but never fear!

If I could give 4.5 then I totally would because almost everything was so so so good about this place!The oysters are amazing. Awesome selection and everyone is very knowledgeable about the oysters and what to expect. I have got to find more Nova Scotia oysters as that was my favorite out of the 2 dozen we had. The prices are great too which was a nice bonus. The drink menu is fabulous. They have a giant beer, seriously it was served in a glass that could have doubled as a bowl!Even though it was busy, our server was always around and the noise level wasn't too bad.The only negatives would be the chairs. Ugh, so uncomfortable and an odd design with just 1 arm. I never felt totally relaxed because I couldn't get comfortable and all of the chairs appeared the same design. And, it pains me to say this, the clam chowder wasn't very good. Not much flavor despite having a lot going on. I even wished the table had pepper to jazz it up a bit.

We tried the Rockefeller oysters and mussels. Omg, the dense, thick, moist yet perfectly toasted and buttered bread that came with the mussels. It was a revelation how good this bread was. Seriously, it was just flavorful and I was amazed at its consistency that I haven't had yet. Nothing like French or Italian bread. You must have the mussels to get your hands on this bread! The mussels were light and packed with flavor just as the plump oysters. The bathroom are photo worthy. Kinda weird brining your phone with you to the bathroom, but just trust it is yet another out of this world experience that they have managed to turn a mundane thing like the bathroom or bread into an unforgettable experience!"

The lobster burger was full of fresh lobster meat, and the brioche roll was soft and toasted. Definitely enjoyed that.

It fades and brightens, very nautical and hip... unless where you're seated means that you get drilled in the eyeballs with periodically bright lighting (that was me).Maybe it's my fault for ordering a lobster sandwich and cocktails instead of wine.

I am not local to Montreal, but I chose this restaurant due to the reviews. I was not disappointed! The service was impeccable. Some of us came inside with bulky suitcases. Our server immediately checked in our bags and coats, and led us to our table, where the rest of our party was already waiting.Our server steered us in the right direction every time throughout the course of the meal, starting with the vino (A new arrival: their Barolo - outstanding), oysters (PEI, Maine and BC variety) - I must say, the BC oysters were the best of the lot, but all three were delicious, the catch of the day (sea bass exquisitely presented in a bed of a fresh lemon sauce, mushrooms and leeks, which most of our table ordered)... as well as a variety of the appetizers, including the salmon tartare and the braised octopus. The braised octopus melted in your mouth. Waters were constantly refilled. Our server was friendly, attentive and helpful - even though we were a table of (mostly) English-speaking Americans. He was so tolerant and translated things so well and with such patience!Honestly, there is no attitude here. They are welcoming and so gracious, despite the modernity of the space (which is beautiful, but it makes you initially think it may be austere and impersonal). Also - the bathrooms are a sight! You have to at least view the restrooms, even if you don't have to go into one. I promise it's worth the visit! All in all, a great dining experience. I fully recommend for anyone visiting the area or for those who live here. Also good to note that it's conveniently located next to the Courtyard Marriott, but isn't on the main road, so it's not populated by many tourists (such as myself!)"

Our group was split in half, with three arriving early and hitting the bar to wait to be seated with the others.Upon arrival we were struck by the rear entrance (there is another one just of the main area we didn't know about). It looked like the back way in, lit by candles and a little bit slippery. But once navigated it drops you off right by the bar.The interior is like nothing I have seen before. Striking glass hanging in sheets and an austere concrete structure offset by a fantastic wood interior. Not loud as you think it would be considering materials. The bathroom doors are a hoot. I won't spoil it telling you here LOL.WE came in on election night, and they had some guests who reserved a large block of seats. as we were sitting at the bar waiting for the rest of our group, we struck up a conversation with the owner. Wonderful lady who told us the whole backstory on Notkins. She shared her passion for the place and it was wonderful to hear her talk about it. She and her staff were very attentive, and whne we mentioned our group being real seafood lovers, she let us in  on a secret.Because of the large block of reservations, they had stocked up quite a bit and thought they might be over, and so offered us the platter specials that had been arranged for the reserved tables. We picket the largest platter option and ordered three.We were blown away. Large trays of fresh seafood (Lobster, clams, scallops, crab, muscles), in an incredible sauce with baby potatoes, roasted corn on the cob and tons of bread to sop it all up. It was a veritable Viking Seafood feast. THe whole evening was a great success due to the quality of the staff and food at Notkins, and also due to the friendly nature of the owner and her ability to share her passion for what she does by running a fantastic restaurant."

The owner was there and was able to get us set up with a good selection of oysters, which were delicious.The food that we ordered was good for the most part, though the clams I ordered didn't seem to have been purged and were full of gritty sand. The fish tacos were the favourite dish. Overall, the food and drinks were expensive for what we received.Other than the food, the greatest drawback was the service, which was exceedingly slow and confused (a friendly bus-boy who offered to go get me some bread in the kitchen because my waiter was nowhere to be found got yelled at for actually providing some service). Our first waiter couldn't answer any of our questions about the food on the menu, I received my food 10 minutes after everybody else even though my dish was the simplest, and we waited almost an hour for our bills at the end of the evening.The decor is very nice though the live DJ is a bit much. They take reservations online through OpenTable, which is always a plus. Bottom line: good food especially if you'll be sticking to the wide selection at the raw bar, but pricey given the unpolished service."

Oysters, salmon, tile fish special, and fish tacos were very pretty and very tasty, if expensive and not filling. Limited draught and wine-by-the-glass lists.

/user_details?userid=hAiso8IQfKW88uWUGDI51g,Josee L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ambiance and decor 5/5 food 5/5 service 3/5Had reservations at 7pm for 3 on a saturday, we were seated immediately. Decor is beautiful and the washrooms are a must see. We sat in the back of the restaurant so we got to see the beautiful architecture of the place.  The ambiance is also great, with the music just loud enough to hear while still being able to have a conversation. We loved the combination of fresh local and imported ingredients and flavors. We started with the Rockefeller Oysters (12$ for 3) which are baked oysters with cheese and jalapeño, they were delicious. My friends both had the pasta of the day which consisted of fetucini pasta and a bunch of different seafood including mussels and clams. They both adored it (24$). For myself it was the lobster burger (28$) alongside the greens of the day (extra 2$). The burger buns were buttery, the lobster chunks were large and smothered in wonderful layers of 2 year aged cheddar cheese. We also had drinks! The green godness (not goddess) (13$) was overly sweet but the pink lady (13$) was just the right combination of sweet and citrus. I intend on going back but I'd love to experience the oyster bar where all the action is. Unfortunately the service was rather slow, it took them 20 minutes to get our apetizers after we got our drinks. And then another 20-25 minutes to get our main dish. Despite this, all three of us thought it was worth the wait."

/user_details?userid=rbufOtPxXfzPZwqxC4W3Cw,Jo K.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,So I was in Montreal for work for less than a day and I ended up eating here twice. I stayed at the hotel across the street and a quick yelp search told me this place was worth checking out. I had the clams and the clam chowder and ended with the grilled salmon. Everything was flavorful and delicious. The ambiance was nice and service was friendly but a bit slow. Also the amount of wine they pour per glass is half of what I'm used to so that was my only gripe about this place. The next day for lunch I ended up having a quick meal of fish tacos here before my flight and that was delicious as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.
/user_details?userid=52p2iAxobpwrBAYBtBmWHg,Jane C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The thing that I liked the most about that place was the service, our waitress really took the time to explain to us the menu, when our order of oysters (Delicious by the way...) arrived, another member from the staff explained the different varieties to us, telling us how they tasted like (Earthy, buttery etc.). The place is great! Not too loud, we were actually able to hear each other, and the decor was really urban/stylish!I didnt like the Cardeau tartare, it was a little too ""fishy"" for my taste, but we loveddd the oysters and the smoked salmon latkes!Its a really nice place for a drink and a little bite!"
/user_details?userid=Cbv9M1zL29rjVFFhbGTpiQ,Elizabeth B.,"Maplewood, NJ",3 star rating,"To start with the positives - fun atmosphere and cool decor.  The appetizers were the best part of the meal - the salmon tartare was excellent.  I'd recommend Notkins to anyone looking for a quality oyster bar.To sound like a grumpy old person - light the stairway properly before someone trips down it and find barstools that swivel.  The stools around the oyster bar look great and are comfortable once you get in, but getting in takes effort.  One of the guys at the oyster bar was texting whenever he had a free moment, but he was getting his work done.The risotto was cold and I told my server - they must have plated it while waiting for the scallops to cook.  Perhaps I should have complained more aggressively, because he did nothing to rectify the situation.  In contrast, the table next to me at Les Pyrenees a few nights ago had a similar complaint and the server adjusted their bill and brought a free drink.We might return for drinks and appetizers/oysters, but not for a ""meal"".  When we spend nearly $100 we expect to be full when we leave.  After leaving Notkins (and having read the comments about the desserts) we walked a few blocks over for a dessert crepe."

I adore oysters and we had plenty of them the night we were there: gorgeous West Coast ones and salty yummy East Coast ones. I was sad that the kitchen was closed, seemed kind of early for that, but they gave us some clams to munch on as well which pacified me. Really nice wine list, super fun staff and the washrooms are pretty cool as well :P All in all, I will definitely come back for oysters and trendy times with swank friends. My next visit, I will plan better and try both the lobster roll and the clam chowder, apparently they are to die for."

They have meat dishes but why get them? Their raw bar selection was great. They had a wide variety of shell fish they serve cold (lobster, crab etc.) they also had three different types of oysters, two different types of clams, mussels, and scallops. I had oysters and a scallop - all were delicious. For dinner we had oyster ravioli's and half flash fried fish. Both were great - but the most amazing was the sweet potato cheesecake. Eat it. The drinks were also great - had some cognac and the bourbon/cider mixed drink with dessert. Also had a bottle of wine with dinner. all great. the only reason I am giving it a 4 star is that the service was good but not great. We had to refill our own wine and water (I don't mind doing this it just states the service level). Also - the bartender wasn't super attentive."

The bread used in both dishes was delicious. The fish taco tortiallas tasted like they were freshly made while the lobster bun was buttery and soft. I recommend this place. My only is complaint is that the menu was not as extensive as I had hoped but perhaps the dinner menu is longer. I'll be back for sure to check out their dinner menu."

A look at Yelp for a recommendation near our hotel showed a quick walk to Notkins. On arrival, we're asked if we had reservations, I reply ""No, this was a spontaneous choice."" I was lectured that one should always make a reservation. Not once, but three times the hostess said we should have made a reservation while leading us around the restaurant that was about 15% of capacity. Got it!Asked if we'd like something to drink, I ordered a martini. It was poorly mixed with too much Vermouth. ...Our hostess mixed it... The oysters were marvelous!  We had freshly shucked and rockerfeller. I order the fresh fish for my entree but, when half way through our oysters, our server came to tell me that they ran out of the char for that evening's special! Ha! By now, three or four other parties had arrived, all being lectured that they should have made reservations! Why not post this in a big block font on their website, rather than looking so rude and unprofessional when guests show?We settle on two bowls of chowder since the menu isn't too extraordinary. Ordinary clam chowder. Meh, and a shrug of our shoulders.The guys that were shucking oysters were the only hospitable people in the place. They were welcoming, fun, and checked in on our satisfaction with our food. As I mentioned, the oysters were delicious. These guys should train the staff on how to come off as being smart and cultivating repeat customers.Great interior, very stylish.We won't be making reservations for Notkins in the future.Sent from my iPad"

Our waiter was nonexistent the whole night, never checking to ask if we needed anything, he was no where to be found, and it was ridiculous.  The bar we sat at had oyster shuckers working behind it, and one of them named Julius was the star of the night for us!! He took care of all the requests our waiter wasn't around to take, was super friendly and outgoing! One of the owners had to go get us coffees for our dessert because our waiter couldn't be found. For a restaurant of its kind, the waiter was awful, to the point that we only tipped because we knew all the bus boys etc get tipped out from his tips. He would've earned himself 0% if we weren't considerate of the others who are impacted. The restaurant wasn't even full.The food however was very good, the oysters were fabulous. The dishes are pricey for the quantity you get, but everything was of the utmost quality at least. We enjoyed the night nonetheless, the place is beautiful and has a great ambiance if you're looking for something upbeat. I'd recommend Notkins to friends, but make sure they request a different waiter."
/user_details?userid=012KRHIrKQGAHEMrn6aZgA,Lena F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Very bad service. Maybe not the waiter's fault but the resto in general. It took 45 min to get a simple green salad which was ordered after our main meals because the portions of our meals were so small we felt we needed to order more. I took the clam chowder (which was good) and the seafood platter for one. My friend the octopus to start and the hanger. We also ordered 6 oysters to share among us. My platter came and all there was was 4 shrimps and 4 crab legs and their sauces and the side order of oysters were served in my platter. I wondered if they had run out of seafood. The hanger was also very small. He was apologetic about the salad being so late and did not charge for a few items to compensate but still I would not return.

Notkins offers oysters to die for. Sit at the bar and enjoy how they are shucked in front of you. If you are lucky enough as us you would see how the owner does it with love and joy. We were also lucky to have his attention towards our non oyster eating friend, who didn't have a choice and had to try one. I'm also very happy with the heirloom tomato salad and its unforgettable goat vinegraitte. French fries are delicious addition to the meal. The wine list offers as many choices to compliment the oyster experiment. Cocktail wise I got addicted to the Tequila Sour. As every respectful Canadian establishment the Bloody Caesar will be served although it is not on the list, it doesn't come with an oyster, but oyster will be offered aside if required. My influential Yelp friend enjoyed few Manhattan di Bologna mixes. We are very happy with the service, sorry for everybody moaning about it in their reviewes. The complicated bill involving a lot of sharing was split amazingly, bravo! The design is sleek and the terrace rocks!

Way to not tell us about the three types of oysters we ordered when you dropped them off. It's an oyster bar... maybe that is something people want to know. It felt like they decided that we were not worthy diners right off the bat. Guess I perpetuate this nonsense by giving a 20% tip. Never again. Here is your honest feedback. We told some locals about this experience and they weren't surprised, for whatever that is worth.Food: Lobster bisque? More like tomato bisque with coarse and dry lobster bits. Our table ordered a lot of different food. Their squid daily special was well cooked. Raw seafood was good... surf clam not good. Nothing else was special to make the food 4+ stars but I would say in general, decent. If you get the half fish, as one of my guests did, be smart about how you debone it... otherwise you are going to spend all night picking meat off of individual bones.Decor is nice."

Extremely fresh selection of oysters, the  scallop ceviche was deliciously unique, and our host offered us a bowl of THE best New England Clam Chowder we have ever had. Worth going back just for that. We also had the fish tacos and loved every bite. Still savoring the flavors. And the DJ played a great selection of music. P.S. Don't miss the restrooms."

/user_details?userid=e-DloYYPPWaMKzLsGv4ang,Irene C.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"Very Disappointing. Don't waste your time or money. My hotel, the Bonaventure recommended another restaurant but it was closed so we found this restaurant on Yelp. The service was terrible and the food ordinary. My husband had the recommended fish of the day and I had the fish tacos. My husband asked if they served bread with the meal and we got a lecture that they only serve it on request because their is so much waste and their are people who have nothing. After this lecture he asked me if I would like bread which annoyed my husband because he wanted the bread. The waiter forgot about the bread but after awhile remembered it. The waiter was filling our water glasses but then ran out so my husband's glass was only half filled. He never came back to refill it or check if we needed anything else though he did check on the table across from us - just basically ignored us. He brought the check when we asked for it but didn't clear the table. My husband was so annoyed that he left a 10 percent tip. The waiter then had the arrogance to lecture us on leaving a 10 percent tip - means that it was bad service and that a manager usually comes over. After we left the restaurant we decided to call and ask for the manager - however we realized this was the manager on a slow Tuesday night.    It was all very disappointing. It was our honeymoon and we were expecting to have a nice dinner. When I got back to the Bonaventure hotel, I let them know of the bad experience and they said ""We never send anyone there even though it's close because of the attitude and ordinary food"""

/user_details?userid=cKldUl-7dbe2SEp5k1QFYQ,Mercedes B.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice and trendy restaurant. The oysters are definitely a must! Although $40 for 12 was pretty expensive, the oysters were very fresh, shucked in front of your eyes, and well-presented on a platter. We also ordered the lobster burger ($28), the kale & clam salad ($16), and fish tacos ($16). In general, the food was too salty and quite expensive given the portion size. The service was also a little slow given that the restaurant was not very busy on a weekday evening. It was a nice treat and we were happy to have tried out this restaurant, but probably would not go here regularly."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very nice spot with beautiful decor and a nice atmosphere. The oysters were excellent. They were offering 5 varieties the evening we went, each unique and all plump and perfectly shucked. Served with a champagne vinegar, 2 hot sauces and grated horseradish. Fried oysters were equally delicious with a light batter and a meaty bite inside. Citrusy mayo was served alongside. The tuna and salmon tartares were tasty with a subtle bite to them, served with crispy baguette bits. The beet salad was also a nice surprise away from the average beet salad with a sprinkle of Romano on top and served amidst strawberries and blueberries. The wine list is not the best but it is decent. The caesar was average. The service was excellent, our waiter was consistent and attentive. We will come back for a main very soon!!"

/user_details?userid=wctSQzHw9VNBHijjTAas7w,M D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Headed to Notkins for Valentine's Day last night. Dan was charming as always but they REALLY dropped the ball on the dinner. Having been there for many great meals in the past we were looking forward to some favs including fish tacos. So the menu is ""in transition"" aka NOT available. They had a ""special"" VD menu but the upper portion was not available. Since the menu was just in printed paper maybe reprint the ""special "" menu so it's accurate. Strike two!  The other menu which was available was basically the cocktail menu nibbles. Salads and other smaller items not appropriate for a celebration like VD. Strike three. We asked to have either the whole fish or filet mignon and were told that despite being on the menu it was only available if we took the VD menu (what was remaining since part of it was unavailable ). The waiter could see our frustration at basically being ""forced"" to take the VD menu (which wasn't appealing to us). So he was able to convince the kitchen to do the whole fish as part of the cocktail menu. The fish, which was $75 was enough for one person (barely). Very small with little meat. Strike four. That's an extra strike right? So all in all we enjoyed VD but not the experience at Notkins. Will I be back? I doubt it. Unfortunate as it's got a nice vibe but thumbs down on the transition menu on VD and creating choices that force you to take a menu that you're not interested in. It's never a good sign if after a $200 dinner you leave hungry and have a bowl of cereal at home!!"

/user_details?userid=OEEUFHzZYpNTPAF49TYq7A,James M.,"Merion Station, PA",1 star rating,"I had decidedly unique experience at Notkins. A friend and I had a delightful dinner on Sunday. I made a reservation on OpenTable for 7pm, although it didn't seem really necessary--there were a number of other patrons, but it wasn't close to full. Great meal, and really attentive service. The only drawback was that I didn't get the signature oysters. The next day, slated to have a late dinner with friends, I thought I could stop by for a drink and oysters in advance. Since it was just me, and I was t planning to be there long, I just dropped by at 715pm on Monday. Like the night before, there were other people there, but it was maybe half full. Lots of empty seats at the bar. A gentleman intercepted me, asked me how many, and then incredibly told me he had no availability. ""It doesn't look like it, but we have lots of people coming and we're all booked. And we're also booked up tomorrow, too."" It made absolutely no sense. I left, and checked OpenTable again. Every single remaining time slot Monday evening was open for parties of 2. And so was the next night. Standing outside, I made a call home, which took 15 minutes. During that time, 2 people entered the restaurant and about 8 departed. Amazed, and disgusted by the gentleman who lied to me on behalf of this establishment, I met my friends at Sel Gras and had a fantastic time. I have no idea what Notkins was thinking, but I hope they enjoy their underutilized restaurant. Good luck with that."
