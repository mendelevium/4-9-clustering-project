The arepa was delicious and filling! Probably the best under-$10 meal I've ever had in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Venezuelan fast food? Yes please! Walked in and got a pulled pork & passion fruit sandwich with a Grape Crush! It was delicious! Big potion with lots of flavor wrapped by a yummy bun. Little pricy but I'd be back one day for more. My guess would be for the empanadas!
/user_details?userid=ln78jiCkj94QkfJlPXO_PQ,Btc P.,"Culver City, CA",5 star rating,My friend and I were visiting from Chicago and LA and stumbled upon this gem during a street festival. The food was one of the most flavorful and tasty things I've had in Montreal! We even came back the next day because we couldn't get the craving out of our heads. Not only was the food delicious the staff was extremely friendly and thoughtful!
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was walking on st laurent street looking for a place to eat when i noticed the ads on Bocadillo's front door. Apparently their arepas are part of the list of ""food to eat before we die"" written by Mtl Blog.Their menu on the wall is huuuge, but the waiter was really patient and nice and took time to explain everything that was on the menu. I ordered their most popular passion fruit pulled porc arepas with extra avocado, the plantain cheese stick (recommanded by the waiter) and the 3 leches for dessert. The cheese stick with plantain was the best cheese stick I had in my entire life, no joke, it was probably the highlight of my meal. As for the arepa, since the corn bread was fried it was really oily on the outside, you could squeeze the oil out by pressing the bread... I wish they could absorb the excess oil on a towel or something. Apart from that the pulled porc was really flavorful, a good balance of sweet and salty. The dessert was disappointing, I find it too sweet in my opinion.The inside is really cozy, a good place to just chill with some friends. There are only a few tables inside though (around 5 if I remember well), so it is a bit packed. In general, it is a great place with an extensive menu. Coming back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"YUM!!!Such an AWESOME little place on St Laurent packed with so much flavor and deliciousness!We popped in here a while ago with some friends and ordered the passion fruit pulled pork sandwich (excellent), grilled chicken sandwich (amazing), guava taquenos (holy moly super good), yuca fries (good) and the side salad (super yum) and were 100% pleased with our experience.The place is small, but service is quick and food is amazing. If you're in the mood for something casual and quick, this is the place to be. Can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=laaC_7aQ5mWm6BNSfHJ8fA,Nachiket P.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Located on St Laurent street, Bocadillo specializes in  Venezuelan fast food. The service is VERY slow, but the staff is super friendly. Their Arepas are yumm. Tried the one with pulled pork and passion fruit. The combination was good, but not the best pulled pork I 've had. The Beef Mechada was ok. Nothing special. Also tried their empanada's. Were tasty, but a bit too greasy for me. They are open late during the weekends (4 am ish). Won't be my first choice, but If its too late and I don't feel like Banquise /  Schwartz's or Chinatown, I'd definitely be backFood -  Good Service - Friendly  Ambiance - CasualWorth the money - I'd say so"
/user_details?userid=qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,Pat M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm still a fan of bocadillos !! Very tasty and traditional recipes as original venezuelan food. My prefere are : ""arepa reina pepiada"" , ""cachapa"" and any kind of ""empanada"" just delicious, i can come back anytime. Nice terrasse in backstore."
/user_details?userid=xva4w2TD1YjAzjxw4qjdRQ,Amelia S.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,One simple word: Pabellon. The salt of the queso combined with the sweet of the plantain and special house sauce will haunt your late night meal cravings. Thanks staff is very kind here. Ramon and his co-worker were really helpful with places to find housing and entertainment as I transition to living in a new city and it was a really great lunch. CAN'T wait to go back
/user_details?userid=u6EdS3cNLrjZeVF8lAAGCw,Brittany H.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Wow. Stopped here randomly while traveling in Montreal and was not disappointed. I ordered the pulled pork and it was delicious. Great prices and great food. Perfect lunch stop.
/user_details?userid=yq_anc6klyL--3z1Ylb7mQ,Nakita E.,"Cambridge, Canada",5 star rating,"We ended up here after walking up St Laurent looking for hangover breakfast. I ordered the Bocadillo burger with a chicken breast instead of beef patty (so good!), my bf had the beef version & a few chorizo tequenos. The service was speedy, staff were personable & the food was delicious! Tomorrow is our last day in Montreal & we've already decided we are coming here for breakfast again tomorrow!"
/user_details?userid=cnn2hU3PnMikCs03Bmhw1Q,Alexander R.,"Cotati, CA",4 star rating,A small but charming place with lots and lots of choices. The empanadas are actually pretty big but delicious and flavorful. Was a bit different than what I expected. Being from California I'm very used to Mexican and this was just totally different but worth every penny.
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"I was a little tipsy from a night out on the town so I might not remember everything lol. Probably drank more than I should have to relieve myself of the bad live music at Bistro de Paris. Or maybe it was cause I was feeling like a wallflower grandpa at Tokyo Bar. But I digress. Bocadillo is a sweet little spot on St Laurent and fortunately for us, the rest of the drunkards hadn't gotten out the clubs yet. The homie Mike suggested the empanadas and I didn't disagree. Beef empanada with fried yucca, if I remember correctly. The dude behind the counter had an impressive beard. I was jealous. The food was amazing, the yucca came with a creamy dipping sauce that was a perfect pairing. Asked for the hot sauce to go with the empanada, and it was the kind of hot sauce that, despite how painfully spicy it is, you ignore because of how good it is. Thankfully, they gave us a big pitcher of water to wash the pain away. Definitely coming back, maybe more sober this time."

/user_details?userid=gz-eh5Qd9YcDy-Ion_fJhw,Gabriela B.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"Tasty food, however the service is terrible. Not pleasant nor helpful. Pretty unorganized. I was trying to make an order for 20 tequeńos (cheese, plantain and sausage), they said maximum order was two of each flavour (total 6) and that if I wanted more I had to go to their other location --I've never heard such thing! I understand they don't want to sell out for future customers but they should prepare for this....we were visiting Montreal for a day trip....time was precious to be spending more time travelling to another of their restaurants just because of their lack of planning."

/user_details?userid=IWZweDQUlsKfLS1_olQqlA,TastyMontreal L.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Bocadillo opens late until 4 am on weekends, perfect for satisfying late night snack craving! Two locations are available, one on St.Laurent above Prince Arthur, the other on Mont-royal and St. Laurent.We had a full meal here - at 11 pm after dinner ha ha, but having passion fruit pulled pork sandwich only would make you happy, along with an imported soda - we had delicious apple soda. Also, not to missed, their tres leches is just a fantastic dessert experience!"
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love hole in the walls and this one is definitely one of the good ones in Montreal! I'm a potato lover and the Yuka potatoes are so crispy and the garlic aioli is a great pairing. I always order their main sandwich with their version of pulled pork! The meat is seasoned very well, tangy and savoury all at the same time. The ""buns"" are grilled to a great char on both sides. I also ordered their empanadas, good but I could live without them. The only downfall is the price is pretty high for what you get and its not something you can get every week. I would definitely recommend as something you should stop by when walking around the city and on st Laurent looking at the street art."
/user_details?userid=1BmKh3oPuTio8mMTVtAKFQ,Yasamine J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a mechada arepa here and it was pretty good, although if I go again, I will probably try one of the more exciting fillings maybe involving avocado, cheese, or plantain. It took a little while for it to come out, and it's not super cheap for the size, but overall, I was full and satisfied with my one arepa."
/user_details?userid=kh8Oh7GmKF1B0C0qdWn-Gg,Christian G.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,We came here to celebrate my cousin's wedding engagement.  We had the empanadas and the rumbera.  We really enjoyed the food and kids eat all of the food which is rare. The food packs lots of flavor so I can see why.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
/user_details?userid=vCDy_Ye5pfQLOXxGqXGulQ,Jessica N.,"Denver, CO",4 star rating,"My friends and I were directed down Boul St-Laurent to a burger place with amazing fries. After walking a few blocks, we decided this might be the place. In actuality, it wasn't. However, I think we made the right choice.The menu on the wall is only in French, but the staff is very eager to help translate and make recommendations. He described one sandwich so well that we all decided to order it. The Camembert came with avocado, lettuce, apples, pesto, and Camembert cheese. It was served on a grilled roll and with pesto mayo on the side. I recommend using the wooden stick holding your sandwich together to spread the mayo on before each bite. The sandwich was fresh and a good mix of flavors and textures. I also shared a chicken and cheese empanada with a friend. It was different than what I've had in the states. The shell was doughy and greasy. Maybe corn-based? Not like the more flaky dough I've experienced. This was also paired with the pesto mayo, a more fitting pairing than the sandwich. The staff checked in on us multiple times and were very friendly. A great option if you're wondering St-Laurent area for a meal."

/user_details?userid=_KWSSqa3_NgsQu455PHipA,bittersweet p.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"The food was good... but I found the Arepas sort of small. Also, I got the pulled pork with passion fruit, and have to say, while it was good, it was not the best pulled pork I've had. The Casava fries however were quite good and crispy. The service however was HORRIBLY slow!!! We waited over 45 mins for our food, even after ordering at the front. For a place that does mainly fast food type food... this wait is unacceptably long.  I may return to try their other foods, but have to say, while it was good, it was not phenomenal."

They made great arepas and a delish breakfast sandwich. We also tried the empanadas and something else w guava and cheese inside, and another type with plantains and cheese. Def recommend. Would like their menu to be translated into English and for their coffee to improve; otherwise I would've given them 5 stars!"
/user_details?userid=FnCsOVQveOgCprf0kUBshw,Hilary C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Loved the food here! I know this place is known as a late night joint, but we went during the day and enjoyed ourselves. All the food here felt very comfort food-y. My boyfriend had the shredded beef arepa, and I had a chicken one with avocado and mayo. My boyfriend remarked that mine looked like a chicken pot pie! Both were delicious. We also ordered a side of coleslaw (good, pretty creamy), and fried yucca (OMG, delicioius!!!). Ask for a little hot sauce to pour on your arepa, and/or mix in with the mayo they give you.One star off because the service was okay, but confusing. When we got there, we didn't know what we wanted, so the guy behind the counter said to take the menus to a table, and he'd come take our order in a few minutes... but he never did end up coming over, after we'd made our decisions. So we ended up back at the counter, but only after a bunch of other people had ordered. Alas, the staff were still friendly and kind, and the food was cheap and delicious."
/user_details?userid=oTK_fC6OaMKIxnAPC2E4xw,J L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Ordered the Passion Fruit Pork Sandwich trio from the Saint-Laurent location and I'm not a pulled pork connoisseur so I'm not going to enter the debate of whether it's the best in Montreal, but for me, this sandwich was delicious (and I was amazed at how fresh the side salad was)! It was packed with juicy and not overly sweet pulled pork. Staff was friendly and polite. I would agree with a few others that it does take some time for the cooks to make your order but keep in mind that you're not ordering burgers from McDonald's. If you have the patience and want to try some tasty ethnic food, Bocadillo is the place to go."
/user_details?userid=OP7nO0dIaYW0O6DYX8-azQ,Charles H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice restaurant that serves  Venezuelan ""arepas"" (round, small cornmeal buns) stuffed with shredded beef, ham, cheese, shredded chicken, as well as ""empanadas"" (similar to the  Jamaican beef turnovers) filled with shredded beef , cheese or chicken. Venezuelan food is a mixture of  Caribbean and Spanish cuisine,  so you can expect lots of onions, garlic, peppers. They also serve ""tequeños"", the Venezuelan version of the American cheese fingers, only better. All the food is fresh, they will even fry the empanadas and cook the arepas as you wait.  Good customer service and a good option if you want to try something different or are tired of the typical Mexican/Cuban fare. It also provides a good opportunity for anybody to try their Spanish"

/user_details?userid=C5RK6X_BY90EGWCLKTPy2g,Coren D.,"Brookline, MA",4 star rating,"Stopped in here for a quick lunch on the way to the Parc du Mont Royal. It's located in the plateau section of Blvd St Laurent, just down the street from Schwartz's. We tried the beef empanada (3.50$) and beef arepa (4.50$) Both were delicious. The filling was slow cooked shredded beef with a sweet and savory sauce. The food is cooked to order, and we enjoyed sitting in the outdoor patio out back while waiting. This is a great place for a cheap snack  and alternative to typical fast food."
/user_details?userid=wregZkyJ3efquMrnrgqGQw,Jennifer A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So it's 2AM on a Saturday night and we're famished but saving pennies. What did we stumble across but this little gem. The Cheese and Beef empanadas were just delightful and perfectly crisp. The 2 sandwiches tasted (1 Beef and 1 Camembert) were both wonderful surprises, especially the Camembert with apple and pesto. The 2 staff were eager to please even though they struggled with their English and (unfortunately for them) seemed to have little French. However, the quality of the food spoke eloquently enough for me."
/user_details?userid=tY-3uPhDaOjpYKYMsvelUg,Carmen S.,"Ajax, Canada",4 star rating,Can't go wrong with the empanadas and tequenos. Make sure to ask for the garlic sauce. Best after-bar snack.
