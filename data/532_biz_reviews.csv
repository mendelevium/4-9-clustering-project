The sushi is really really good and is ALWAYS fresh.The prices are pretty decent and the service is always very quick/waiters are very friendly and helpful with sushi selection!The restaurant itself is pretty small so make sure to make a reservation- and if you can, take public transit (especially during the winter) because parking can be a HUGE pain!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We picked this restaurant because it was close to the escape game we wanted to go to. We were 6 people and the service was fast despite the restaurant being packed. It's a fun restaurant because it is BYOB so we brought wine and sake.It is a Japanese restaurant but they also have Chinese food which is good because my brother's girlfriend doesn't really like sushi but loves Chinese food. I tried some of her salt and pepper pork chops and omg it was delicious! it was juicy and there was no bone! It had a hint of curry spices added. My boyfriend and I had the chicken corn soup followed by the edamame. The soup was good like the ones in Chinatown. The edamame was not very impressive however. I've had better elsewhere. We had the hamburger appetizer which is made up of scallops, spicy crabstick, caviar and unagi sauce. This was so good and came highly recommended by the waitress. My brother ordered the scallop cake which is similar but has way more mayo. I personally preferred the hamburger. I just realized as I am typing this that we ordered the beef sashimi because it was also highly recommended by the waitress but we never got it!! omg! I hope we didn't pay for it! I don't have the receipt anymore. This is what happens when you drink too much at a resto lol. We had the shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi and the following sushi rolls: Dragon tear - salmon, carrots, shallots, shallots, caviar, spicy sauce and deep fried inside (my least fave probably because of the carrots).Uchi sushi roll - octopus , caviar, crabmeat, shrimps, spicy sauce and tempura (my favorite roll).Caterpillar roll - spicy tuna, tempura, cucumber and covered with avocado Sushi pizza - rice cake , spicy mayo, avocado, smoked salmon, cucumber, tamago, crabmeat stick and caviar (there was a lots of cucumber and crabmeat but not very much smoked salmon).If you are in the area and want a decent sushi or Chinese restaurant that allows you to bring your own wine or beer then I would recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Went last night for dinner; the service was excellent! Our water was topped off regularly, and everything arrived to our table in a timely manner. The special salad, garlic broccoli, vegetarian dumplings smothered in an amazing peanut sauce, and fried tofu were all delicious. We then ordered the sushi pizza, which was unique and consisted of a perfectly fried rice patty topped with avocado and chopped up imitation crab & egg. The sushi rolls we got: dragon eye, caterpillar, sweet potato & avocado maki. And also, we got the tuna sashimi.Yum. Everything was excellent and will be going again!"
/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"7/10Just order their specialty rolls.They are pretty unique and descent. Presentation is great also because it's on a boat or bridge.Their regular rolls and sushi are nothing special, all you can eat level. Quality of the fish is soso.Lastly if you are ordering general tao or beef and brocoli here,your at the wrong restaurant.Service is hit or miss,sometime you wait 3 mins for food,other times 2 hours."

Who knew! It's not the cheapest but the quality is jus tap fantasticThe waitstaff is kind. It is open late!

/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Okay so my husband took me here for my birthday awhile back since he knows i love sushi. It's a byob and you need to make reservations because it gets busy really fast. The menu consist of an assortment of sushi, sashimi, maki AND Chinese food. Not really a fan... Anyways we were seated at a table way too big for us. It felt like i was a mile from him. Lol! The restaurant itself is quite loud so we needed to almost yell to hear each other. It took awhile for the waiter/waitress (we had different waiters waiting our table) to come to us. We proceeded on ordering a general tao with rice and a chef's choice of sushi on a boat might i add! Kinda tacky if you ask me. It came with a choice of hot and sour soup or won ton soup. We had one of each. The hot and sour soup had frozen mixed vegetables and wasn't hot nor sour. The won ton was like the ones you would find in a Chinese buffet. Not off to a good start. Then the general tao was oily, saggy and way too sweet. The rice was ok. It took forever for the sushi to get to our table and our wine bottle wasn't opened yet! When we finally got our sushi boat, we weren't impressed by it. It wasn't unbeatable. It could of beed better, that's for sure and the combination of litchi with salmon was off putting to me! At 60$ +taxes for 29 pieces is quite expensive for this poor quality of sushi. Coming here didn't ruin my night but i am certainly not coming bad. The service was bad. The food not so good and it was loud enough to be unpleasant! Maybe it wasn't their night. Maybe they were short staffed. That's too bad. I wish i could give more stars..."
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I guess this place is okay. Decor is nice, but the quality of the sushi is about the same as a good all-you-can-eat sushi place. The presentation is cool thought, we got a sushi boat for two and the portion was quite generous (could've fed 3 people probably, we had to take some home). BYOB, which is very nice. Service was rather slow though; they almost had a full house and I only saw one or two waiters on the floor."
/user_details?userid=vGVBXJTCJ1KBOHT6Xao7hQ,Max G.,"Montpelier, VT",5 star rating,"We stayed in Montreal for a weekend, and Uchi was a five minute walk from our AirBnB. When we walked in, there was obviously a 20+ person business party, and a couple other groups as well. They were packed, but there were still a couple tables left and the bar was empty. We placed our order to-go, and asked our waiter if he knew where a nearby supermarket was, and he happily gave us directions. We left Uchi and came back a half-hour later, and then waited another half-hour inside. So we waited close to an hour in total.If the place wasn't packed, I would have been very dissapointed with how long we had to wait. But it was very clear that the staff were very busy and being as quick as they could, so I understand our wait was necessary.We ate back home. The food was wonderful. The miso soup was delicious and authentic. Aside from miso soup we ordered six maki rolls. They were great too. My only complaint is that the spicy tuna roll and the spicy salmon roll were not spicy at all, not even a little bit. But they were still both very good, so this is not enough for me to take off a star, just a warning to the spice lovers.I highly recommend eating at Uchi. The food is fantastic, and it wasn't outrageously expensive at all. We will definitely keep Uchi in mind next time we visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=rsfHQdZl_DsR0uDuqwJLFg,Charlotte J.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I've always had good service here. The sushi here is superior to a lot of the other downtown options, but you pay a price for that. Their nigiri costs twice as much as that of other sushi restaurants in the area, and I'm not sure that it's truly worth the extra cost, but all the rolls I've tried have been good and seem more reasonably priced. Would recommend trying this place if you're looking for a good sushi spot and don't mind paying a bit more for the quality."
/user_details?userid=NwXwR_tfwcfqXT1wiTEzIA,Mike S.,"Indianapolis, IN",4 star rating,"Good food, good service.Not sure what it was that took it down a star for me.  But, it has to be truly stellar to get 5 stars.We are visiting Montreal and my girlfriend picked it for me as she knows I love Sushi.  She does not like Sushi as much as me and bravely tried some of what I ordered.  If we were local this restaurant would be on my rotation of Sushi restaurants."
/user_details?userid=ZOwEPWw-F1FHAOHc0m19Cw,Will M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I'd been to Uchi a few times before, have always had a great experience, and it seems like their popularity has grown considerably since our last visit. The food is terrific, both the hot dishes and the sushi. Standouts were the seaweed salad with shrimp and octopus as well as the salt and pepper squid.Where Uchi suffered this time was the service. Despite a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table and after that, it took forever to get any attention from the wait staff. When we finally got service, it was to plop a bucket of ice on the table for our wine. There was no serving of the wine. Throughout the entire night, service was unfriendly and slow.It just goes to show how, when eating out, food quality isn't everything when it comes to the experience."
/user_details?userid=31R6vlT0uOaniSs5hHpiuA,Susan C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Worst customer experience ever when I ordered online. Expected waiting time was 45-60mins, so I was waiting for one hour and made a call to the restaurant. They said it is on its way without checking details. I have waited another half an hour and called again then the restaurant said there was a mistake so the order did not even go through. So after waiting for 90mins, all I was offered was either cancelling my order or they can do ""express"" order with 15% discount, which will take another 45mins. The person who picked up the call did not even apologize. Very very disappointing. Will never order their food online."

/user_details?userid=UXbCcmkYGl3DH_Py5UOtbQ,Toni M.,"El Cerrito, CA",5 star rating,"Normally I'm  mistrustful of restaurants that serve more than one type of cuisine on the assumption that there will be a lack of authenticity as well as quality.  Uchi was on the list of restaurants recommended by our B&B hosts so we decided to give it a try tonight.  It's about a block and a half from the B&B.  We noticed it on the way back from Coo Rouge the first night.We walked in and were seated.  The decor is spare and quietly elegant.  There are booths against one wall, a sushi bar on the opposite wall and tables in between.   We were given menus, a couple on sheets of paper, the other in a padded folder.  I noticed the list of soups included Chinese, Japanese and Thai.  It was too warm for soup so we didn't order any.  There were three salads, one of which was called ""special salad"".  I asked our server what was in the special salad and  he told me crab, avocado, caviar and I forget what else.  We ordered that and mixed tempura, then chicken w/ black pepper and crispy spinach and beef w/ garlic mushrooms.  We ordered tea to drink.  Alan observed, like last night, people bringing in their own wine and beer.  Later he asked our server about this and the server confirmed that it was much more expensive to have a liquor license than to encourage patrons to bring their own and charge a nominal corkage fee.The salad was served first and it was a revelation of flavor and textures, a mixture of crab, tobiko, avocado, crisp romaine and other ingredients in an almost sweet creamy dressing.  It was simply exquisite.  The tempura was crisp and not the least greasy, three prawns, sliced sweet potato, zucchini, eggplant and another vegetable I forget.  They were served w/ a dipping sauce that was slightly sweet but not overbearingly so.  The chicken was served following the tempura and it was terrific.  Neither of us had had spinach cooked that way.  The chicken was fresh and tender. The sauce was flavorful w/ a little heat from the black pepper.  There were slices of green peppers and onions.  The dish was accompanied by a small bowl of rice, as was the dish of beef and mushrooms.  Both dishes were excellent, full of vegetables in addition to the meat.  Both sauces were fresh and flavorful, not overly thickened.  They were elegant and refined.As we were finishing, one of our hosts walked in to pick up takeout.  He greeted us and chatted a bit, then greeted the restaurant staff.  He told us Uchi had been a Japanese restaurant until 6 months ago, when it had been purchased by a Chinese family who had kept the Japanese menu and added some dishes of their own, maintaining the previous high quality.  If this restaurant were at home we would certainly be regulars."
/user_details?userid=DW8SPSNRRCRtX3SVJ673JA,Amanda J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent sushi! Only a la carte and no buffet option but the sushi sashimi were generous portions and the sushi was good quality.Price ranges from $20-$35 depending on your order.BONUS: It's Bring your own wine! We brought sake! I recommend making reservations. I wish they were on OpenTable
/user_details?userid=53qjYo8wC3hYaAR9kxToNw,S C.,"Surrey, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is ok.  Their Chinese menu is better than their sushi, but then, Montreal isn't the best place to find good sushi.  Enough quality to be worth their pretty reasonable price, though.  I gave an extra star for delivery, even though their delivery guy seems to be missing a few screws.  One time, he came, got buzzed in, and then left claming he ""could not find the apartment""  Um... it's in the building you were in???  not to mention that my door is 6 feet away from the elevator."
/user_details?userid=PsvVX_PBTqhu5CJjpoolIg,Tom K.,"Reston, VA",5 star rating,"I was in town for work and staying close to Montreal Central Station.  Lots to eat in the area, but I decided to take a short trip out to Uchi and I am glad I did.  I've eaten sushi all over North America (and other places too, like Tokyo) so I know good sushi when I find it.  This place definitely gets 5 stars!  The Nigiri was great, but even now (it's been a few months since I was there) I'm sitting here writing this review and salivating at the thought of their Salmon Lover's roll.  One of the best rolls I've ever had.  Must find a way to get back to Montreal soon so that I can hit this place up again!"
/user_details?userid=seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg,Stéphanie S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Tried their special ""Sushi Boat"" it was good but nothing extraordinary, found it a bit pricy for what you get. Ambiance and service is good."
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the best sushi places in Montreal I'd say. My boyfriend is probably an even bigger fan than I am for this place. We ordered a dragon maki which was served in a wine/dessert glass with special sauce. YUM-MY. We ordered an assortment of regular makis and some special ones like the dragon. I came here twice and both were spaced apart. The first time they had only a Japanese menu. The second time they added Thai. Szechuan food which made me a bit skeptical of the quality of the sushi. But that actually made no difference, the sushi was really quite delicious. Very fresh and not too much rice in the makis like some places. The rice and ingredients were well proportioned. (not too much of either rice/fish...but a good balance) Their presentation is nice as well, serving our sushi on a wooden elevated plate. It is pricey though, so expect to spend at least $30-35 per person. Ambiance is nice as well."
