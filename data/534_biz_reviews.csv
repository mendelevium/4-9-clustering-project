/user_details?userid=00bBCxn1CljPrkB9czooRQ,Jessica A.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",5 star rating,"We arrived at 5pm, and were able to be seated at a reserved table which wouldn't be occupied until 7pm. Don't be fooled by the grunge-y exterior! Once inside you'll see a charming bar surrounded by tables, some with cushions! If you decide to go outside, there's a lovely garden terrasse with lights and plants everywhere! We ordered 3 entrees, a main dish, and a side of edamame beans. All of the dishes arrived one by one about 15 minutes after ordering, which really impressed me considering how fast the restaurant was filling up! Every dish we ordered was delicious, the chicken pad thai had a lot of chicken and egg in it which I really enjoyed, and the sauce was tangy and helped bring all the other ingredients to life! The calamari, crab cakes, and tuna tataki were all very impressive dishes, just big enough to enjoy without filling you too quickly. The edamame beans were tossed in a soy based sauce and caramelized onions, which I had not seen done before. And guess what: LOVED it! Quick and friendly service, incredible atmosphere, and worth a second trip!"

Grenade looks a little ghetto from the outside but once you step inside, you're in for a treat. Cool how they have a separate entrance straight into the terrasse area!We came on a Monday evening for drinks and some bites to eat. Lots of areas to sit at; we choose the last available high table, the rest had reserved cards on them. Funny enough, no one showed up and they ended up taking all the cards off.Apparently, they have a ""happy hour"" (from their website) but the only thing on the menu that was on special was three crappy beers. Talk about false advertising. - Lucky sangria ($10.00) - nice and summery. They added a few blueberries, oranges, limes and lemons. - Lotus ($10.00) - quite ginny but this drink grew on Cbear. She ended up ordering a second one. - Edamame ($6.00) - best bang for your buck. Soya sauce was well balanced and added a nice sweetness. There was also some grilled onions and shallots. - Chicken dumplings, Thai shrimp and calamari meatballs and beef satay ($27.00) - ordered separately, its $9.75/dish so you save a wee bit ordering 3 or 5 sharing plates. Food was all surprisingly good! Beef satay was very tender, meatballs were stuffed with seafood and dumplings crispy.Definitely overpriced for what you get but I guess that's to be expected at an Asian fusion place. It was a slow night so we decided to check out a couple other cool spots in the area."

Perfect for a 5@7 to mingle with friends or colleagues. Nicely decorated terrace and has a homely feel to it. The food was pretty good. We took the 5 tasting tapas and were happy with our choices: satay, tuna tataki, Thaï calamari and shrimp balls, mushroom rolls and chicken dumplings. My friend took a Pisco cocktail and really enjoyed itI would definitely come back here again."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Grenade is such a fun bar! Very trendy and hip. I visited with my boyfriend on a friday night at 9pm and it was pretty busy. According to the bartenders it really starts to fill up at around 10:30pm, when the DJ's arrive. Unfortunately, I wasn't hungry because I went after having my anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. He wasn't hungry either but we could see what everyone else was eating and it looked so good! The presentation was excellent. We did order some fries just to snack on. They came with some really good spicy mayo and some green onions on top. Really appreciated those. My boyfriend also ordered a beer (1664) and he said the beer selection was good.If you're ever in the area, plan a visit here!Will come back in the summer to try out their terrace :)"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Walked by this little bar on my way from dinner and stopped in because I saw the cool little fireplace with a few chairs around it and saw the lights hanging in the back and a little disco ball. Great atmosphere for a backyard feel. There's little blankets which is sweet reminds me of Paris at the cafes outside.Drinks were great. Service was a little slow hard to find or waitress or even to track here down to pay but she was sweet and gave us free shots :)
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Great spot for 5@7 in the village ! In a quieter area though but still fun energy and great vibe ! Their terrasse is one of the best parts of coming here. It's very open, spacious and comfortable with lots of Space for groups with enough music for ambiance without being too loud. Our service was a little slow but it was pretty busy that night so that being said they still checked in on us and we didn't have to wait overly long for anything. The food was not bad -Asian fusion , mainly smaller dishes. we tried croquettes, steamed buns and grilled beef skewers all tasty and were nice as an accompaniment to drinks but I don't think I would come here just for food. Their cocktails were solid we tried their sangria and a spicy signature cocktail. I liked this place and I would definitely come back !"
/user_details?userid=xZCVxM7KS49Jj2F_CiiRmA,A. R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"4 star food, drinks and ambience but 1 or 2 star service. Snooty and slow - servers were ""busy"" on their phones. Pricing system is overly complex and about $2-3 too high per dish relative to portion size. They also refuse substitutions. That said, the Korean fried chicken and pork belly bun were both pretty standout. And the drinks were solid (especially nice to see some thoughtful and complex virgin drink options - as the designated driver I usually get the shaft but not here!)Be aware, if you're planning to try a few small plates and order more later, the sizes are very small and you might incur a 20-30min wait time for each round. They also won't honour the 3-plate / 5-plate deals unless all the dishes are ordered at the same time. (No warning unless you ask.)Meh. With so many great restos in Montreal that capably deliver great food at a better price point without the snotty service and policies, I can't justify going back here even though their terrasse and some dishes are above average."
/user_details?userid=cPT-E02ZVvzevldYI-vrAg,Stan S.,"St Louis, MO",4 star rating,"Don't be put off by the exterior of the place, which looks pretty sketchy, once inside its nicely laid out with indoor/outdoor seating. Lots of beverage choices and a menu that skews with an Asian fusion approach to its offerings. I found the service very good and it seems to be a good place for cocktails and hanging out."

/user_details?userid=msz6ZGliabTF7v6zXYDc1w,C C.,"Troy, NY",1 star rating,"I don't know if it's because I'm a young American, but I went last night with my girlfriend and I was served the weakest drinks of my life in glasses overfilled with ice. I intended on staying longer and ordering food but I left very unsatisfied and disappointed in a place that has good reviews and is often recommended."
/user_details?userid=Zzagn2Xg7sIcPeoP5TZ8OA,Rahimah M.,"Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,"We decided to go walking along the street we were staying on- Rue Ontario and stumbled upon this somewhat hidden gem. Busy and full of young crowd with good music. My friend walked in and passed the indoor bar to the back where there was a cool patio with dropped lanterns and lighting. There was a cool fire pit occupied by some patrons so we sat in the middle. Ironically there was a disco ball hanging from the back but it actually didn't seem awkward at all. Cool ambience with lots of locals in the ""industry""We shared a pitcher of the ""Lucky Sangria"" which was definitely not sangria- had quite the twist to it- made with sake, ginger beer and vodka amongst the mix. Definitely had a kick to it but was very good. Easy to chat and relax. Did not have food there but the menu did look appealing. Service was good- waitress friendly and talkative. Would go there again. It is in the Village so would definitely look it up if not staying in the area. We definitely felt safe walking but it's up to the individual - can get there by metro/ cab/ car or walk :). Drinks reasonably priced :)"
/user_details?userid=S5oMD5z3sQ2K93UunjBBUQ,Clara V.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"Although the vibe and terrace are nice and trendy, that's about all this place has to offer. Came here for drinks and dinner, the cocktails were 10$ and were pretty small and not very strong but they have good variety. The food was average at best and quite overpriced. Not authentic at all but I guess for a bar that is to be expected. Pad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice. If youre coming here just for drinks I wouldnt say don't go but if youre looking for drinks and asian food I would 100% brasserie Pamika, it is much better in terms of flavour and authenticity and also has a cool trendy vibe"
/user_details?userid=z0EA8RrIk7JVHNLcjlDz1w,Emma G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"This place ruined my time in Montreal. I went there for a friends wedding and it was immediately clear that they had done absolutely nothing to prepare except put ""reserved"" signs on a few tables. According to the groom, who spent the entirety of the night trying to get the things they had asked for in advance, he called them 4 times and every time the bar seemed to doubt that the wedding would show up at all...hence the lack of preparations? It was near impossible to get drinks and they were very rude. At one point later in the evening me and two of my friends were being aggressively harassed by an extremely drunk man, and not one BUT TWO people who worked at the bar walked by looked at us standing there helplessly being yelled at and walked away, doing nothing. I was absolutely appalled by this and also frankly felt unsafe and completely disprespected. Stay the f away from this place."

/user_details?userid=k7rXRNP6bQPl3Z2sqqRyZQ,Olsen V.,"Lucerne, Switzerland",4 star rating,"Two words: Bloody Kimchi. On our first evening in Montreal, we visited Grenade, which was recommended by our host. It was a rather slow night, even though a Canadiens game was on. I had a bloody kimchi, which was surprisingly delicious and spicy. I loved it! Later, we had the poutine with pulled pork, the dumplings and the edamame. The edamame was served unexpectedly different than we know it: served in a dressing with sesame seeds. Everything was very tasty! We wanted to go back on January 1st, but unfortunately, it was closed."
/user_details?userid=NpLqVIQzwRtfLn7xhWbytg,Marc T.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"The experience was ok. Service was efficient and very friendly. Ambiance was a little more loud then expected and since the table was located just off the kitchen, there was lots of kitchen-related noises. If you get a chance to reserve a spot on the terrace, it looked amazing but unfortunately I could not get a spot there. Food was ok I had the ""steak frite à la coréenne"". I asked if I could substitute the fries for something else and was offered more salad that also came with the meal. Food was good, well cooked and perfectly seasoned. Overall it was a good first experience at Grenade. I forgot to take any pictures so I guess I'll have to try it again next time I visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent big but cozy bar in the village! Happy to have finally made it here for a 5a7 to sit on the shady bright terrasse and enjoy the tamarind margarita and the super tasty pad thai. Service was kind, a little young and chaotic, but that's not the worst. Music was disco flavoured and you could tell even at 5pm that this place gets deeply fun and funky. The inside was dim and cool and the whole space is well designed. Menu is small bites, couple of tasty cocktails, decent wine, uninteresting beer. Can't win 'em all, can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=1UO1BIsBT3Q9u_W_IwSBnQ,Marilou B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went there on a Thursday for the happy hour. First, I must say the background is beyond amazing, pretty large and well decorated.The service was pretty slow. It took us over an hour to receive our plates. At one point we almost left. But, it was a really busy night so we were understanding.Over all, I recommend the place for their really nice background and the sangria."

Very cool place to go and some original concepts we enjoyed: steamed buns were yummy and was intrigued by all the different cool drinks to try. The gummy drink was fun and colorful!"
/user_details?userid=dctu_FcNlLCUOVSxIr9iLg,Sladjana D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Just came back from Grenade. I LOVED the look of the bar, especially in the outdoor/indoor terrasse. I felt like adding some sand and getting a beach party going! There was also live music - not sure if that's standard on a Thursday night or it was a special event- but they did some great covers. My friend and I shared a pitcher of ""Lucky Sangria"" which basically has nothing to do with sangria. It's peach vodka with sake, ginger beer and white cranberry juice. I only really tasted the sake and ginger beer at first but I'm definitely feeling the vodka now :) Getting really crazy by writing my first Yelp review. It's how I do.I recommend it for a 5 à 7 - professional or personal."
/user_details?userid=UqlMkfiUaB73ISSDm9SkIg,Jason M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Never go to this place for drinks, you'll wait forever and never get served.  I went here twice, two months apart, and the second time I went I had to walk out because I was waiting forever (at the bar!).  I do t know what the bartenders are doing or even where they are, there are a lot of staff, but apparently they don't serve anyone."
/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place is great in the summertime! They have a lovely patio in the back with lanterns and  the environment is very hipster/chill with nice music. The food was great! My friends enjoyed the pad thai and I had the pork buns that we're delicious :) The drinks are great too! I recommend it 100% +++

Tried their tasty sangria and a few of their Asian-fusion tapas. Although portions are on the smaller side, the dishes were very flavourful. Friendly service and would definitely go back in the future."

Love the cocktails menu and the Steamed Buns are amazing, especially the Tofu. The Duck platter for two is an experience on a date. Weather permitting, eat outside on the beautiful patio. Indoor decor is also beautifully done."
