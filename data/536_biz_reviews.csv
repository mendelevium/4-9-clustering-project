My friend and I went there on a Friday for lunch and it wasn't too packed, but I hear it gets very full in the evening, especially from Thursday to Saturday. The service was impeccable, the waitress knew her menu and was very nice to us. We ordered two plates: the burrito and the lasagna. The food is good, but I'd have to admit it wasn't more than good. I love to try out vegetarian restaurant, but I want them to have something that will make me not think about meat, and this felt a little bland to me. It wasn't bad, it was just not a wow factor. Despite everything, I really want to give them another chance, so I will definitely try it again."

I am never disappointed with Lola Rosa. If you go there, i highly recommend trying the Nachos!It's honestly one of my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Montreal! I have tried many of them, but Lola Rosa is definitely up there!"
/user_details?userid=eQ-ukSPHXYvUhYR_wysd8A,Lily F.,"Brookline, MA",3 star rating,"The setting here is lovely, with strings of lights and rustic wood tables (open the drawers to see little notes from previous customers). Service was kind too, and spoke French and English (was a little put off when they spoke to me in English when I'd greeted them in French and asked a question in French though - I always can't help but think it's because I'm Asian, and it makes me self-conscious about my French even though I'm fluent).That aside, I wasn't super impressed by the food. The vegan poutine didn't have any ""cheese"" in it at all, and was topped with mushrooms. It was very salty and hard to eat. The hemp burger was super filling, but also very salty. I'd give this place another try, but I'd recommend lowering the salt content in those dishes."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came for vegan brunch and wasn't disappointed, on the contrary. The carrot lox was lovely, loaded with cashew cheese, capers and red onion and served on a perfectly toasted bagel. The plate came with loads of breakfast potatoes on the side, not those tiny ramekins like you see in most brunch places all over Montreal. We also had the turmeric shot which was garnished with freshly cracked black pepper right before serving to help with the absorption of curcumin, it was a perfect slap in the face! My partner's plate had the best tofu scramble ever! No more bland turmeric tasting tofu scrambles, give me Lola Rosa's tofu scramble!Also, do yourself a favor and add the extra vegan sausage, it's totally worth it! It's the same sausage they use to make the hot dogs in their William spot, it's so meaty and quite  addictive if I may say so.My only complaint is that there aren't enough places like Lola Rosa. No one wants chia pudding or oats for brunch, give us pancakes, sausages and vegan bacon! And potatoes!"
/user_details?userid=E5nRF4bClGRgpo9JeCHfqg,Suganya H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Had their soup which was salty. Three cheese spinach lasagna to die for and their side salad was good too! I will come in again for that lasagna.
/user_details?userid=AQ2NQCAQFBukeFcrVcuBqw,David S.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,"It's just a bit overpriced. The food here was very average, which isn't to be negative but moreso to say that it wasn't amazing. Still a nice lunch though.The soup du jour, which was zucchini soup today, was delicious! It was my first time trying such a soup and I liked it, especially considering I've often perceived zucchini as not the most delicious vegetable.I upgraded to the poutine instead of fries, and it was an earnest effort. There were vegan curds and the gravy was black bean based. It just didn't make my eyes open wide like I hoped. Our server was very friendly and helpful in deciding what to order.I actually really liked our coffee. It hit the spot; exactly what I needed.To be fair, it was a good experience and the restaurant itself is very nice and has its little quirks, like notes from past customers in the drawers at the tables. I will definitely have to come back and try other dishes. Cheers."

She had been vegan for a while and suggested that we try out this place.  I was sceptical but agreed to try this place. I was very surprised they had a lot of great options I ended up getting nachos and the lasagna and it was great everyone was happy with there dishes definitely would suggest this spot !
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I love love love Lola rosa. I don't go as often as I wish I did. I've tried most things on their menu (poutine, salad, nachos, Cajun burger, etc) and I've loved everything. I think they do such a good job at making the food taste and look good and it's healthy. The Poutine has a base sauce made with mushrooms but I honestly couldn't taste the mushroom. It tasted really close to gravy to me. The nachos are insane. They add so many ingredients together and it works! I would suggest getting them as a shared entree. It's different from the other vegan/vegetarian places I've tried because it's a much more relaxed place. It's not ultra trendy or fancy. It's super casual. I obviously recommend this place a lot :)"

I came here on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm and it was pretty packed. We had a reservation but otherwise we would have had to wait a bit. We were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. The tables are cute and the decor in the restaurant is very stylish. I ordered the quesadilla, my partner ordered the Cajun burger and his parents ordered one of the salads and hemp burger. We all loved our meals and found them to be very well presented. I didn't find the quesadilla super filling but it was still a nice portion for the price. We had the brownie and ice cream for dessert which was delish. I'm sure we'll be back!Food 4/5Service 5/5Value 4/5Atmosphere 5/5"
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here with two friends, one who is vegan. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was very empty on this Tuesday evening. At the busiest time, about 5 tables were occupied. We started by sharing some vegan nachos. I saw all the reviews saying how delicious it was, so I had high expectations, but it fell so short! The cashew cheese, was not great. It kind of tasted like mustard. But to be fair, I've never had cashew cheese before, so I don't know if it's supposed to taste like this. There quantity to toppings for the amount of chips is decent. My biggest concern was that the chips were soggy! When we got to the chips at the bottom, we had to scoop them up with our forks, because they were so soggy! The chips were sitting in an actually puddle of (tomato?) juice! After that, I had the burrito. It was good! It had really nice flavours. However, the portion of rice and salad on the side was a little disappointing. My friend's Cajun burger also fell short. It was very oily, but it came with a good portion of fries. The service was okay. Two of us got there early and the waitress kept asking us to order. It was nice when she first asked, but after the fourth time, it started getting a little bothersome. Also, we finished our water rather quickly and we never got a refill. Here, I would like to remind you that it was not busy at all. The staff was actually talking amongst themselves most of the time. To sum it up, it was a disappointing experience. I might try to Lola Rosa on Milton next time, but this supper was a real let down."

The poutine was delicious and the curds were very fresh.  Our server was great and knowledgeable. We were there specifically to try the poutine so that's what we did, but would like to explore the menu more if we have the chance to return."

/user_details?userid=ck1FtZr0wYXv7HBV5bU8ZA,Wenn S.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"I love vegetarian food but alas we did not have a good meal here . 1 star for the food The extra star for the service and atmosphere . Service was fantastic and the garden setting was beautiful But back to the food. .. the vegan nachos were very soggy and probably the best thing we ordered . Decent Tex mex flavor ( not spicy in any way )The curry tofu was very bland and really quite forgettable. I dug into my chickepea stew with great anticipation  as the description sounded fantastic and when cooked well , chickpea stew can be absolutely delectable with warm notes of cinnamon mingling beautifully with raisins and turmeric but this was not the case. The feta cheese was the only slightly exciting flavor in that plate of food and even then that umami flavor did not marry well with the chickpeas , watery rice , turmeric or cinnamon. I took bite after bite desperately hoping my initial impression of the dish was wrong but.. tastebuds do not lie and I was yet again disappointed . I was starving but really could not bring myself to eating more than 1/4 of the dish. My son had the sweet potato burger and he told me that the sweet potato patty was too oily and heavy and even the solo onion ring on the patty was too eggy . Sadly a very mediocre meal. On a more positive note we saw many customers around us enjoying bright colored iced drinks that looked wonderful . They have a very nice outdoor area too littered with wooden benches  and an array of comfy colorful cushions . Maybe a good place for drinks ?! Sadly we will not return so will never know."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If it were only based on what I ordered, I would have given this restaurant a 4 star. Unfortunately, my friend didn't have as good of an experience. Overall: While this place is vegetarian, I'm really pleased to say that when I go there, I don't miss meat. The plates are so tasty and varied that I don't even realize meat isn't involved. This is a rare feat amongst vegetarian/vegan restaurants so props for that! Atmosphere: great, not too loud, not too packed and yet pretty lively. Cocktails: good variety, would recommend most of them! Food: the best plates in my book are definitely the mac and cheese (for a delicious and homey feel) and the green curry (for a more refined experience in terms of flavours). The nachos are good and the half portion is surprisingly big (id even order it as an appetizer for a group!) The poutine however is quite disappointing in my opinion. This is what my friend ordered. First off, it got served and was cold. That's really bad for a poutine. She had to return it, they made her a new one and it was warm but the cheese was also cold and never melted. The sauce is so-so and over time gets kind of mushy. Not a fan of that plate. Seems like they have some hits and some misses so order wisely ;)"
/user_details?userid=JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,Amy Z.,"Newmarket, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good vegan restaurant right outside the hotel I stayed at recently! Seriously, it was across the street and the sign said 'vegetarien' so obviously it was a sign that it had to be my first stop before anything else. I wish they had this in the greater toronto area. It's so cute, and definitely reminds me of something in kensington market (downtown toronto). Lola Rosa is huge and has the hipster-type of feel to it. Service was friendly and there were zero problems communicating. We ordered a sangria, which was HUGE and between 3 of us, we could barely finish. We all had a serious case of munchies (perhaps from something.. y'know..) and this was the perfect place to satisfy our hunger. Everything here is vegetarian, and 80% of the menu you can change to make vegan (they have daiya cheese!!!) I had the quesadilla, which I found hard to finish because the portion was so big and it also came with rice and a side of salad. It was unbelievably good though.. I also ordered the chickpea/corn fries and they were soooo good. My friends said they tasted like cassava. I kept eating and eating until my stomach literally HURT and I still couldn't finish it. Needless to say, my case of the munchies had turn into a case of itus until the AM. I definitely would not hesitate to return to lola rosa next time in montreal."
/user_details?userid=IlvHu0uu8OuHeB8tsKfg3g,Avita T.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"This place is good but it isn't really outstanding in my mind. I visited a Lola Rosa 2 years ago on my first visit to Montreal and quite liked the food, from what I remember and was excited to come back.However, the food was not particularly noteworthy. I got a hemp burger and exchanged the fries for poutine fries. The burger was good but just not my favourite burger ever. The fries as well, nothing noteworthy. Perhaps, the only redeeming factor of this place for me was my drink - a white wine sangria. A-Ok is a good way to describe this place. Just not sure how keen I am to pay for average food."
/user_details?userid=j0tcQwuG9byNUAmPS2bqNQ,Nicole D.,"Oceanside, CA",5 star rating,"***EAT HERE*** We always try to eat at a Vegetarian restaurant while on holiday. As a former strict vegetarian of 15 years, I still like to eat this way so Lola Rosa it is! I ordered the Oeufs Benedictine which came with avocado and smoked carrots. The Hollandaise sauce was so light and the carrots were so good! The eggs were cooked perfectly. I missed the English muffin component but the crostini was very good. The breakfast potatoes were so yummy! I added the vegan bacon and it came in a small serving dish that a condiment comes in. It was in the form of a flaky skin of some kind resembling crunchy endings of the leftovers of something that was cooked. I've had vegan bacon before but have never seen anything like this. My dish was very good despite the vegan bacon oddness. My husband had the Vegan Nachos! A huge pile of the best fluffy corn chips I have ever had topped with guacamole, black beans, salsa, corn, sour cream, onions and peppers. You can get this with cashew cheese if you like. Very delicious! What I thought was very cute was that the tables have drawers in them and people have written notes and messages on the back of their receipts and left for everyone to read. Fun Idea! I would have liked to have visited the other Lola Rosa restaurants but we didn't have the time."

I had to try the classic Lola poutine that everybody talks about. I had the vegan one with queso. I enjoyed it. Would I have it again? Probably not but I'd go back to try the curry dish everybody raves about.

/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I LOVE the ambiance here but the last time I was here they stopped the music which took away from the experience.I was enjoying their gluten free poutine until I found out that they used the same oil for cooking other things so there could be cross contamination :(  Also.. I really wish there were more gluten free options. I wasn't a fan of the salads as the cold broccoli was weird to me. I want a lasagna or burger with a GF bun OR some really tasty fresh salads. There were a tiny bit of egg shells in my hash omelette. Might be a 1 time fluke. Most people wouldn't notice it but I'm very sensitive to that.Their gf nachos had way too much raw onion in it, my son didn't want anything to do with it. I don't know why it wasn't listed as being spicy on  the menu as it certainly is.The coffee and lattes is just OK. The dessert options that were GF and DF were also really limited. This place is more for someone without food allergies or sensitivities."

Although it's a vegetarian restaurant, it has never disappointed my hard core non vegetarian husband. I love the sublime tea here, it has chamomile, lemongrass, & rose. So refreshing. The alcoholic beverages are good too but I don't really remember the names. I wasn't a fan of their chickpeas fries though. Don't forget to get the Lola nachos, you'll thank me later!"

I felt it lacked much flavour, I suppose in part due to the lack of seasoning.I also didn't enjoy the tables. The seats weren't the most comfortable and the table sat significantly higher than my seat, so leaning over was not enjoyable.Overall a very ""meh"" spot. I would go back just for casual drinks with friends, but wouldn't be my first choice."

I only came because it was my friend's birthday and she really wanted to try this place. Thinking back in it, I don't think I fully enjoyed it because I found the menu limiting. When your allergic to seeds (of any sort) and tofu it takes away some options. I ended up getting the mac and cheese with jalapenos. It was good but SO SPICY! My mouth was on fire! Dessert was a pleasant surprise. I got some sort of deconstructed cheese cake and it was pretty amazing. Although the food wasn't to my taste, the service was great. We had a great waitress who answered our many, many questions."

The food is always amazing, and it's a great option for vegetarians to bring their meat lover friends to show them we eat more than tofu! Most meals have a vegan option as well. The staff is friendly, the vibe is really nice (they always have good music), prices are reasonable, and service is on point! Try the desserts too, you won't regret it! The only downside is the menu would need a few more dishes and the portions should be a tad bigger."
/user_details?userid=0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",4 star rating,"Love Lola Rosa, and this location is my favorite of the two locations because it's much bigger and the atmosphere is superb (good for groups. Good for dates. Good for hanging out with a friend or two). The menu is a little different from Lola Rosa Milton and I prefer it (I mean... chick pea fries with vegan aioli. *Mic drop*). When I'm traveling and feel like I love restaurant, I go often (see: Aux Vivres). I hit up Lola Rosa Parc two times because the food is really good and their wine list is lengthier (including a sparkling). And yes, everyone talks about the nachos. They are *that* divine, but there's a whole lot of other wonderful things here (those fries! I die!) and their veg burgers (there's a hemp burger and often a second special. Among the world veggie burger hall of famers! Get this if you're really hungry. It comes with the chick pea fries). The only thing I don't recommend is the tagine, because I found the flavor to be bland and I really didn't like the flavor and consistency of the seitan (odd because the seitan in the tacos at Lola Rosa Milton is phenomenal!) Finally, there are vegan desserts, people. Extremely rich, decadent vegan desserts. Also GF options that I can't speak to but I always notice that they are there.Similar to Lola Rosa Milton, service here is really just so very nice and lovely. We knew we had to try the vegan chocolate cake when our server dropped an F bomb to describe how incredible it is. This foul-mouthed New Yorker always appreciates a well-dropped F bomb."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"I love Lola Rosa and the idea behind this restaurant, so when a Vegetarian Prof. came to visit us (research group) I immediately taught about this place. Not a great idea looking back.We preordered a place for 11 people (a week in advence) when we got to place it was almost empty they first placed us in a nice big table but 5 min later moved us to a smaller one (for 8 although we were more people). Btw the big table was empty all night. After we finished eating they asked us if we want dessert when we took our time they said that they need table so if we dont want anything else they will appreciate it if we leave. A nice way to kick out a paying customer ( we just finished dinner for 11+lots of pitchers). I love the milton location but will avoid the park one after this experience. The only ray of sun is that the food is good (hence not one star)."

My fiancé and I are not vegeterians , I am a GLuten Intolerant tho. We were very positively surprised with the quality and taste of the food, also of the gluten free options. I have gone to quite many vege places but this one seems to get the flavors quite well. My fiancè had -burrito, he quite liked it even tho it did not have any meat as his usual burritos, and I had -the curry -which we both loved. We also tasted : -Nachos -great- but could come with the option of non vegan cheese tho.-Chick pea fries- interesting - underspiced- they would taste so much better with garlic & salt n pepper. -deserts all utterly delicious, especially the gluten free ones I had- coconut chocolate brownie- so good - for the raw kind- We were really impressed. My friends tried all the other deserts and they loved it all. I recommend this place for a family and friend gatherings- the service was superb!!!Food great.Drinks great.The only thing that was not satisfying was the fact that some things were under and some over spiced- for example- one day curry was medium the other super salty- and shirley temple- tasted very artificial, and had way too much sugar, to the point you couldn't drink it unless you split it in to parts and mix with water in 3 other glasses. (4 full glasses all together and still too sweet).Tip- try not to eat several hours before going there portions don't look big but all that fiber will fill you up so much , really to the limits! Eat slow, for real."
/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I hadn't been to Lola Rosa in a few years, before tonight.  You would think that as a vegetarian, how can I pass this place up?  I'm somewhat sad to say that I'm just not that impressed.  My mixed feelings are not due to a negative experience, but rather to mediocre ones.On paper, Lola Rosa is doing everything right.  A great selection of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menu items, even a poutine!  A bunch of great sounding desserts.  I've been conceptually enthused ever since I first heard about the place.Unfortunately the culinary experience I've had on my several visits simply has not lived up to this promise.  The food isn't bad, but I just find it lacking, in a way that's difficult to quantify.I'm leaning towards the hypothesis that they are a little too ambitious in throwing in ingredients.  This is something I'm guilty of in my own cooking, the difference being I don't operate a restaurant - I only need to please myself.Some dishes don't have enough flavour, take the veggie burger and the dessert, while others like the poutine have so many competing elements that it's hard to isolate the signal from the noise.  I'm left with a feeling that something is lacking.All this being said, it's very likely that I'll come back because I still can't resist the sound of some of these dishes!  I just need to remember to manage my expectations."

I didn't leave anything behind at the end of my meal, could be because it wasn't a very large plate or could be because it was so damn good. I'll go with the latter. :D I enjoyed it so much that I devoured it so very quickly. I wanted to try the hemp burger that so many yelpers raved about but they do not do any substitutions for a whole wheat or multigrain bun instead of the white bun so I went with the curry. Had the vegan flourless L'incroyable and it is delicious! A rich chocolaty hearty dessert. This place has a nice ambience with smooth jazz music playing in the background.

Service was slow - took so long to get drinks that we ordered our second round after we finally got our first drink - although we were a larger group (less than 10) so forgivable. However, one member of our group did not get her food until after everyone else was finished - not so forgivable. The cocktails were the saving grace. The food was horrible. We had the cajun burger and it was hard and burnt and far from flavourful. Would not recommend. Plenty of better vegetarian options in this city."

It's always awesome to find a restaurant that caters specifically to vegetarians. They had a wide variety of menu items, which were clearly marked if they were vegan, gluten free, or could be modified. The waitress was very nice and did not even appear judgmental when I ordered a tempranillo at 12:40 PM. I got the burrito, which was modified to be gluten free by removing the tortilla. The flavor was really on point and I especially liked the sweet potato puree.  The salad that came with it had some really tasty dressing.

/user_details?userid=cI4HOmEOCT8ig5e9nQsAwA,Joanna A.,"Dorval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In honor of one of my good friends Ruedi coming back to Montreal for a quick visit, we decided to try out a restaurant that I have been wanting to go to for months now.  Lola Rosa is a Vegetarian (Vegan Friendly) Mexican, Comfort Food Restaurant and it has two locations.  There is one located at 545 Rue Milton and another one located at 4581 Avenue du Parc.  They also offer a delivery service but it is definitely worth going inside just for the ambiance.There is a bohemian vibe once you enter and hanging on the walls are canvases with art of Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix and Paul McCartney done by VictArt (view his official website here or like him on Facebook here).  You are seated at wooden tables that have drawers full of random notes from previous diners, some of which were love notes... it was all pretty cozy and it is definitely my kind of place.  Since it was a Friday night, it was packed so we had to return in an hour- therefore, I highly suggest you make a reservation in advance since it is a popular spot.  Before ordering, if you are a vegetarian or vegan, be sure to follow the legend they have which tells you which dishes are suitable for you.We started off the night by getting the pitcher of one of the beers of the night and I also tried the Lola Cocktail which was absolutely delicious.  It had a bit of tequila in it but the citrus flavor and the mint made me want a whole pitcher of that alone.  It was absolutely delicious.For the appetizers, we shared the Portobello Farci and the Demi Lola's Nachos.  The Portobello was amazing and that is coming from someone who doesn't usually like mushrooms.  The nachos were very addictive and the portions were quite large for it being a ""half portion"" appetizer.  I would definitely get the nachos for the full meal in the future.  They were delicious.For the main meals, we ordered the Quesadilla with mixed salad and brown basmati rice, the burrito with mixed salad and rice and the Green Curry and House Tempeh.    Every single dish was amazing.  Since the friends I went with do not usually go to vegetarian places, it was a new experience and they still really loved it.  The portions were once again massive and it was hard for us to finish our plates.  We even felt bad for leaving the few parts of leftovers we had on our plates- everything tasted so good.We had also heard that their dessert was delicious so my friends got a coffee, a ""Hot Shot"" which is a dessert cocktail with espresso in it (yes, like its name it is in fact a shot), the Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and the Choco- Coco Pie.  The brownie was definitely better than the Pie but the pie was also amazing.  The crust had quinoa and almonds in it and the rich flavor of the chocolate mousse was enhanced with the slight taste of avocado.This restaurant will definitely have me as a diner on several more occasions.  The staff in incredibly polite and you can tell that they really care about the service they are giving you.  It is not a place where you would want to have a ""quick bite"" since it is a laid back, unhurried atmosphere.  However, the staff does make sure to check in on the status of your order while you are waiting and the dishes are cleared almost as soon as you are done without it feeling like they are rushing you.  I am honestly so thrilled to have finally come to Lola Rosa and I can see why it is a ""Meat Lover's Favorite Vegetarian Restaurant""."

Woah, talk about amazing, and oh so filling. Next we each had a Lola Rosa salad. Amazing a great variety of greens and veggies. The combinations of the both was definitely a lot of food and my mother and I had trouble finishing. More recently I want back to try the coveted vegan poutine I have heard so much about. It was delicious. I love the mix of gold Yukon and sweet potatoes. The gravy is a little different then traditional poutine, but I still loved it and definitely recommend. Lola Rosa, we will meet again."

I was craving nachos and I'd heard from a friend that Lola Rosa's nachos were amazing, so I decided to order a demi portion, which came out to $11.50. However, because Just Eat has a $15 minimum for delivery, I added a side of tempeh for $4.75 to top it off. When I got my order, I thought I'd good someone else's order by accident. There were two small bags of kale chips with smiley faces, a covered plate of nachos and another aluminum container labelled curry in big letters and smiley. I checked the receipt and it was my order alright. The staff were just kind enough to give me extra food!Food wise though, I was less than impressed by the nachos. They're loaded with toppings but I think I'm biased though because I like felt like it was missing something as it was vegetarian (ground beef??) But I would recommend this place to vegan/vegetarian friends in Montreal."

I think the staff is starting to recognize me I come so much! First of all, THE LOLA NACHOS! These are amazing! They are perfect for sharing (especially the full size...HUGE) and they are so very delicious! I have gotten them so many times and my friends love them too. The soups of the days are always enjoyable. My favourite thus far has been the sweet potato soup! So tasty! I could drink that stuff! The Lola Salad is really good although sometimes I've gotten it with a bit too many peppers for my liking. The dressing is yummy and the avocado and chick peas with the essence of the olive is delightful!  The burrito is pretty good but honestly I'd rather go with the nachos if I'm in the mood for something like that because they're better. I have yet to try the poutine, but I've tried the sweet potato fries. Pretty good. They are mixed with golden fries. I liked them but wasn't amazed by them. I have a soft spot for the chickpea fries! I find them so tasty although sometimes I think they can be a little undercooked! Regardless, I always eat them and can't get enough of the sauce! The mac n cheese is wonderful! A bit on the spicier side (I think it has green chiles in them) but so great! Each dish is individual cooked and has bread crumbs on top! The brownie with ice cream was okay. Not as good as I was expecting but hit the spot for chocolate cravings. The ambiance is awesome! All of the tables are little desks and you can open the drawers and leave notes inside and read other people's notes. So fun! There are also several books. And there is a bar too if you are into that. You can order take out too just walk up to the bar and order. I think they also deliver. Sometimes they get really busy so a reservation on a weekend evening is not a bad idea. Awesome place! Great food! Happy me."

H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Was really looking forward to trying this place.  First impressions were that it is has a very cool vibe and seemed pretty busy even though it was way after regular lunch time.  So I couldn't wait to try the food!  Since I was by myself, the wait staff was going to put me at the bar, but it was way off to the side and nobody there.  I asked if I could have a small table.  Staff said no problem and asked me to sit in the waiting area.  Well, apparently they completely forgot about me.  I waited, and waited.  I saw two tables of twos leave.  I was patient.  Didn't want to rush them.  Maybe they haven't had a chance to bust the tables yet.  Twenty minutes, later, I walk up to the front and it's like they never saw me before.  WTF?  Okay, calm down, I told myself.  Maybe someone was new.  Maybe it is unusually busy for the time.  My chai latte came out first and it was fantastic.   Spicy, creamy, and loved their presentation.  It came in an individual French press looking contraption so you could see all the spices they used for the chai.  My hemp burger was really good.  However the chickpea fries were really greasy and the side salad looked like it had seen better days.  I love salads, but I could not get myself to eat it because it was all wilted.  Was it just under the heat lamp for too long or is this the standard?  The dressing was tasty though.  I'm debating with whether next time this happens, should I just ask for a fresher salad?  I'm always afraid the staff would do something bad with my food.  Overall, the staff was pleasant and service was good after the initial seating snafu.  As I was getting ready to leave, I realized I shouldn't be too hard on Lola Rose.  Here I was at a vegetarian restaurant with my Pajar winter coat with animal trim on the hood. Hahahaha!  What an a$#hole I am?  Sorry, but it's the only coat I have for subzero weather.  Touche, Lola Rose!"

I really loved that concept. The deserts arent really worth it. I would suggest to skip them.

She asked me if the potatoes were cold or lukewarm (what a question, they are not warm enough for a decent dish). She took my plate, brought me back my avocado toast and told me the potatoes were on their way. It took forever to get potatoes back to the point that we had to waive again at the other girl. I ended up with a plate of extra hot and dry potatoes. My husband told me that his potatoes were dry too and his dish quite boring. We don't think of going back in the near future."

Remember to get the avocado (it costs extra, but it's so good!) and sit outside on their patio. Their inside seating is nice as well since they have big windows that they open that connect to the patio. The curry and Lola Rosa poutine with sweet potato and potato fries are also really good too!! The curry is a bit spicy, so if you don't like spicy food I would recommend you don't get this.

All three plates were good but the lasagna is what stood out for me. Topped with a mountain of deliciously melted cheese it was the best vegetarian lasagna I had ever tried.We also ordered their trio of desserts which included a chocolate mousse, a cheesecake and a crème brûlée.

I went to this restaurant after being invited by the owner (he provided an offer I couldn't refuse) to try this establishment out for a third time. As a starter, I ordered, once again, the Portobello mushroom which was great. It was exactly how I remembered it the first time... Delicious! The only small negative comment about the dish would be the small salad that came with the said mushroom; it lacked dressing which really didn't bother me for the sole reason that my main dish was a large Rosa salad. That Rosa salad was Huge in all aspects. Never have I ever enjoyed a salad like that before. And the best part of this salad... The price; about 15$. I highly recommend! Seriously, don't think twice, just order it. As stated in my last review, my biggest disappointment was the service but not this time. I was seated instantly, the waiter passed by several times to take our orders or to check up on the table. The food was placed on our table within a responsible delay. Great improvement and on point.In conclusion, I would go back again, especially for that Rosa salad. Thanks Pascal H. of Lola Rosa Park!"

We heard good things about this place and, let me tell you, they were all true!The service is fast and friendly.  The food is reasonably priced and tasty.  What more can you ask for as a hungry vegetarian?!  Perhaps an avocado garden, but that's a different dream...Anyhow, my partner and I each ordered a salad and the chick pea fries to share.  I ordered the kale and quinoa salad which was wonderful.  Very fresh and not too heavy on the quinoa.  My partner got the Rosa salad which was equally as delicious!  Fresh veggies, yum yum yum.The chick pea fries were also very tasty.  The waitress accidentally spilled some off the plate when delivering them to us - oops!  But she quickly apologized and all was forgiven.  It was one slippery plate so we couldn't blame her!  It came with a sauce that wasn't exactly ketchup but it was dark red with a dollop of mayo in the middle.  A very nice ketchup alternative!In addition to our meals, my partner ordered a glass of sangria.  It was very strong, the brandy was quite pronounced.  This is probably a good thing for most people (like us!) but I have a few friends that can't hold their alcohol too well, this drink may have sent them over that tipsy edge.  The mother-daughter duo at the table next to us enjoyed a full pitcher of this zesty concoction!  I bet they had fun night afterward... To be honest, when we first approached we thought it was a little dead for a place with such a good reputation.  As it turned out, all of the patio was reserved for a private event!  We saw many people, young and old, gathered at this fine venue to enjoy laughs, drinks, and most of all, fresh vegetarian grub.  Important to note, there were charging outlets near the table we sat at so my partner could charge his ever-dying iphone - he loves to check his feeds...Unfortunately, we were too full to try any dessert but hopefully next time we can enjoy some sweet treats at the end of our meals.Thanks Lola, or Rosa... whatever your name really is..."

/user_details?userid=5Whxw2YadF90nRlAsryayw,Alex P.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"What a reminder to not blindly rely on high Yelp ratings - Lola Rosa was an utter disappointment. We left regretting the money wasted, the calories wasted, and feeling icky about having eaten fried stuff that we didn't even enjoy. Sunday afternoon, and the restaurant was filled mostly with families with astonishing numbers of children. Super noisy, but oh well. The water tasted so heavily of chlorine, I doubt the restaurant has a water filter. When I refilled my boyfriend's glass from the water bottle I always carry along, I noticed a huge lipstick stain. My boyfriend said he had just been drinking from that side of the glass - gross! Note to bartender: spend less time slowly, slooowly filtering that precious Kombucha, and pay some attention to those menial tasks like washing glasses as well.The food was one big disappointment. I had the Cajun Burger with smoked tomato relish and fried pickle. It comes with fries, which turned out a soggy, stale, lukewarm (at best) pile of the leftover bits at the bottom of a batch. The salad was a small handful of greens with a pinkish dressing that had no taste beyond being acidic. The burger itself was edible but utterly boring, the patty had zero crunch and it was a soft, tasteless mush that felt odd in my mouth and fell out of the bun in large chunks. My boyfriend had Lola's Poutine, which was a big pile of the old stale fries with a sauce that tasted heavily of cardamom and cumin - a heads up in the description would have been nice! The taste wasn't balanced, but overpowering. When the server came around to ask if everything was okay, we said no: the fries are soggy and old. She offered to check with the kitchen and came back with the statement ""they said that is our style of fries"". So the official statement is that Lola's fries are stale and lukewarm...I'm all for simple comfort food done right, but our experience at Lola's screamed overall carelessness. Maybe it was that Sunday afternoon shift which nobody cares about, and from the loud cheering and hollering coming from the kitchen the crew was preoccupied watching the Olympics. We'll never find out, as most certainly we'll never set foot in the restaurant again and regretted ever trying it - waste of money and precious tummy real estate. ​We left in disbelief how far the gushing reviews and the reality of our visit were apart."

They got their drinks and food within a reasonable time but I and my husband kept waiting for a very long time. Finally I caught the eye of a server and indicated that we were still waiting and had not been served even our drinks. The excuse was that my drink was rather complicated. They did not even bother to get beer for my husband. Finally the drinks were served and again no sign of our food. Now the French couple sharing our table also felt something was wrong. Eventually I got up and spoke to the manager and told that her we were being given a very racist treatment.  She of course denied that and later told me that there was some confusion about the entree ordered by the couple sharing our table because of which our food got delayed. That didn't make much sense. To top it the drink and food were nothing to go crazy about.Very poor show.

There was some kind of flavor I didn't really care for in the dip that came with my bean-based fries (which were surprisingly good), but the service and the overall ambiance were pleasant. I would come here again if I ever find myself back in Montreal."

I had their Seitan and Black Beans Burger, and it tasted burnt and really salty. The salad that came with it was really great though, I could tell that the dressing was homemade and it complemented the salad really well! I realised that many Yelp reviews were on the hemp burger so perhaps I'll go back to try that again! I'm agrophobic and phonophobic, so it was not the best idea to go around 12/1pm. It was extremely loud and the place was really packed. (But obviously me being stressed out isn't their fault, but it was loud to the extent that even my friend who doesn't have agrophobia and phonophobia noticed how loud and noisy it was in there.) Overall, I didn't have a great experience, but I'm hoping to go back there and to be proven otherwise. I have high hopes, especially reading all the other amazing reviews!"

I wouldn't have asked for it if I knew I would be charged, I was just trying to enjoy my meal. This plus the 30 minute wait for food really made for a mediocre experience.

A vegetarian bistro in the plateau that I likely would not have found without him.  Lola Rosa is easily described as a non-vegetarian's favourite vegetarian restaurant. I am an insatiable and unforgiving carnivore and I liked this restaurant...surprisingly, a lot. They have the cutest terrace, and the service is warm and pleasant.They don't have a big menu but it's diverse and almost everything can be made vegan or gluten-free. It's really well-priced and above all, it's delicious.

/user_details?userid=VvpHaZJE1hLilwrI8hn-Mw,Maximilian J.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there last night and really enjoyed it. I love meat, but I'm open to the occasional vegetarian meal if the flavour is good.Started with the half nachos and small poutine. The nachose were excellent! The salsa, guacamole and sour cream were fresh and tasty, the chips had a good crunch, and the cheese helped keep it all together. The poutine tasted like a poutine. The fries were fresh and had that rustic feel to them, the cheese had squeaky goodness, and the gravy was thick and rich.I had the hempburger for my main and the burger itself was delicious. I love a good burger, so I was surprised by the very familiar flavour. The texture of the patty is off, but that's to be expected. The flavours were spot on, though, with a good BBQ feel to it. The salad that comes with it was nice, but I really wasn't a fan of the fries. They must be different than the ones in the poutine, because these started out okay on first bite but the more you chewed, it started to get a grainy texture to it. I was so full by then that I didn't finish the fries and was so satisfied by the meal that I didn't care.I really wanted to try dessert - the brownie with ice cream looked amazing - but I was too full. Maybe next time.I had a cocktail with two kinds of rum and mango juice. It was a bit small, but delicious.Overall, I was really happy about the meal. The environment and service was also great. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, and not just vegetarians. I'll be back!"

The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, but has something for everyone. Personal favourites are the poutine and the nachos. But be warned, the large nacho plate is enough to feed a small army. Seriously, we got one between three people and were barely able to finish. Granted, we each had a small poutine first, but that besides the point. Anyway, I can't recommend this place enough. Check it out!"

My daughter had the coconut, broccoli with dill soup and loved it; I had the hemp burger and found it wholly satisfying and tasty. The chick pea fries were interesting but a but tasteless like eating puffed air. The half nachos starter was excellent and quite substantial. Good though small beer list (I had the local Alchemiste IPA and liked its bitter hoppiness). The Mac and Cheese was a little disappointing-didn't think the artichoke hearts really worked. Needed more cheese, and a bit of cream would not have hurt. The poutine started out looking good but quickly ended up looking like brown mush-more crispiness needed in the fries.Service was cheerful but hodge podge, meals coming out at different times (though we were a large group). Pretty long wait before first drinks were brought out. No salt or pepper on the tables (and some of the dishes could have used some salt). The atmosphere was young. Probably perfect for the college/University vegetarian crowd."

I ordered (for delivery) the fries ($4.25) and the Black Bean Burrito ($13). When you add up the tax, delivery charge, and delivery tip, it came out to nearly $30 for one person. For that price, I expected good food. First of all, everything arrived cold. The fries were rubbery. The burrito was mushy, the rice on the side was dry, as if it had been cooked days earlier and refrigerated, and the ""green salad"" it came with was literally just lettuce with a side dressing. Even the salsa was terribly bland. I don't know, it's as if they don't even like food..."

/user_details?userid=IMbEQSbZp4mQ2tOFjtEmig,Michael C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lola Rosa is more than just a ""vegetarian restaurant"" because I go all the time, and am not a vegetarian. The food it serves places it firmly at the top of all fast causal restaurants in Montreal. I have 3 important tips: #1 order the nachos, #2 get the salsa on the side (firstly because in the oven, the salsa makes the chips soggy and an important characteristic of nachos is how crunchy the chips are; secondly because you get a decently large bowl of salsa when asked to have it on the side, I believe more than would be used if you didn't get them on the side, and so can put as much as you want as you eat it), #3 order the nachos again. The Parc location puts corn, roasted bell peppers and guacamole on their nachos, which is different than the Milton location, which does not put corn, and has raw green peppers and sliced avocado. The crunchiness from the raw peppers on the Milton nachos is found similarly in the roasted corn, which also provides sweetness. Aside from the nachos, the sweet potato and black bean burrito is great, and comes with salad and rice on the side. A third dish I'd recommend is the lasagna with a Caesar salad on the side. They're great with refilling water. My only criticisms are that they typically charge for hot sauce, though, it isn't your typical Frank's or Tabasco, it's from the Asian food store Eden on Parc and one of the spiciest hot sauces served at a Montreal restaurant aside from the one served at 3 Amigos. Also, for ""pickup"" orders, they insist on charging a credit card on the phone (the Milton location allows you to pay when you pick up the food); this is probably from people ordering and not picking up the food, but I think is a policy that could be loosened, or conversely, have the Milton location also require the credit card for delivery as to not make one seem more accessible than the other. After your meal you won't even remember that they don't serve meat there."

It's got that sort of contemporary minimalist aesthetic with a ""natural"" spin (i.e., replace modernist white cube with wooden benches). It's not very personal, but it's pretty. It is a bit pricey, but not completely out of reach, and it feels worth it for a nice date since it is perfect for quiet conversation. Basically, it's all for special occasions (at least for my budget it is). The menu is not big, but it is jammed full of good things. The menu is clearly marked vis-a-vis vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. I highly recommend the risotto and the basil creme brulée will blow your mind (so save room for dessert!).
