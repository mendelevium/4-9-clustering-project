This place serves traditional Quebecois cuisine. They recently moved over from Mont-Royal street to a nice location on St Denis/. The menu features all the Quebec classics. It was my 1st time here and I had a hard time deciding what to order...so many great classics to chose from. So I went with the traditional Quebec plate, which features meatball stew, meat pie and all the fixings, including a great pudding chomeur for dessert. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu, including a traditional Quebec breakfast menu. And for those worried about dining in, they followed the Covid recommendations 100%. I felt completely safe dining inside."

My partner and I both got the Quebec plate each, which had some meatballs with thick gravy, mashed potatoes, tourtierre (meat pie), steamed veggies, some bread, a bean soup, fried/baked beans (super duper delicious), and pouding chômeur (dessert). I honestly didn't think beans could be that good, but they were unbelievably delicious. This is a cool, spacious joint with a modern diner twist where you can try some tasty Quebecoise food... But make sure you come hungry. The pouding chômeur (literally poor man's pudding) is a white cake that's baked in syrup (sugar, maple, or both), and then has some cream served on top for serving. Quite delicious, actually!"

Decor is quite unique -- all these great little counters! -- and the wooden chairs are extremely comfy. Tons of natural light.What's not to like? Perfect place for a quick, no-nonsense brunch."

It looks like they moved just a block away or so, so they may have lost a bit of their old counter diner charm in their new place. Who knows? But I have to give them them 5 stars for their delicious devotion to the OG Quebecois food cause & ambiance. This place should be featured on every Andrew Zimmern/Anthony Bourdain type travel show & unfortunately hasn't been, thus far anyways. As for the food, I've only had their breakfast -- typical North American one with a Quebecois twist. But you can also tack onto your breakfast an original dish like tortiere for a couple extra bucks."

Visited this cozy place while travelling and was delighted with the meal and service I received. I ordered the 2 eggs 1 crepe combo which came with beans, bacon, ham, toast, meat spread and choice or syrup. It was all delicious!"
