You can tell the Hurtado family takes great pride in what they do.I have been for both lunch and for dinner numerous times over the years, and every single time it has been a delight in every way.  This is a Greek restaurant, but offers a wide variety of amazing entrées from various kinds of seafood, to steak, to chicken, lamb, even escargot... on this last visit I had some mixed seafood ceviche which was awesome.  Their salmon or shrimp are absolutely delicious.  One of my favorites is the grilled chicken shish kebab (brochette).   Of course, their gyro is classic Greek goodness!   Everything I have ever tried here has been cooked perfectly, steaks done to order, all served hot and fresh.  The salads and deserts are also wonderful! The service I have received is consistently impeccable, professional, and friendly regardless of how busy it is.  And believe me, it can get busy as it is a favorite among locals!  The staff, all family members, speak French, English, Spanish and Chinese!  The ambience is casual.  They have outside dining as well as a two level dining room.  There are large pictures of scenes from Greece to help set the mood.  Can you tell I really love this place!?  I do!  I so wish we had a restaurant like this in the Texas Rio Grande Valley where I live."

I have been to the fantastic restaurant twice and always be impressed by the friendly service and scrumptious Greek cuisines，especially lamb chops and shrimps！The portion is big and the price is quite reasonable. Definite worth more visits
/user_details?userid=VWQWbrHagnQ86VVxQ6xCog,Yier A.,Hong Kong,2 star rating,"The food simply taste bad. This restaurant seems to be owned by an Asian family, so the food doesn't taste authentic compared to other Greek restaurant. The fish is marinated with  a lot of GINGER juice, which tries to hide the fact that it's not fresh. It is overly cooked and taste very dry. Although the portion seems to be big, but underneath the seafood there are actually just fries cooked a while ago, which are not crispy. The Shrimp is ok, but they put too much garlic in that I think. The rice they offer actually tastes like those fried rice offered in Asian restaurant, which is ok good, but again not Greek. The service was however friendly."
