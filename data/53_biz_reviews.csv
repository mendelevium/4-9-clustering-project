/user_details?userid=w2c6Xzt-0ZKMDJ7DYsm9PQ,Elaine L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this restaurant during the street mural fest (there was a food stand just outside their restaurant) and I had only decided to order from here due to the convenience of the fact that there was no line. I didn't expect much of it at all and had only wanted to fill my belly. Little did I know, but I had the BEST butter chicken ever!!!! I'm usually quite picky when it comes to butter chicken as I usually find most plates quite spicy/too sour/not creamy enough/or is seasoned with too much spice. The butter chicken here is simply amazing! It fits all my criteria- it offers a hint of spiciness to kick off my taste buds, it's creamy and it's rich in flavour. Most of all, it's affordable (for only $8!) and comes in a perfect ratio of rice, butter chicken and naan. It was so simple and so delicious. Definitely will return for the butter chicken and will try everything else on the menu!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Some seriously delicious indian food. Their butter chicken, lamb korma, and garlic naan bread are packed with flavour and just so good. The only thing I didn't like was their bahjis and the papadums. They are either made too soft or too hard and the flavours are off. I've had their food delivered and dinned in. I think it's fun to eat on their terrace more than getting their food delivered. Delivery is free after a $20 order but I found that the prices charged were a bit higher anyways. Also they accept payment by card but only over the phone and I'm not too keen on handing out my credit card number over the phone. The best of both worlds is ordering by phone but picking it up in person."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"YUM! My husband and I were craving indian food and this hit the spot. It's listed as a $$ but it's really more of a $ in my opinion. I'm new to the area so I'm not super familiar with the pricing yet, but everything seemed pretty cheap. I guess if you got multiple things it would be $$ though. The restaurant is definitely geared towards takeout so the ambiance is very takeout casual, but I don't really care that much as long as the food is good. We got the non-vegetarian combo for two and it was a ton of food! The lentil soup was AMAZING! I've had a lot of indian lentil soups before and this is probably the best I've ever had. It was a little sour and spicy and sweet all at the same time. The samosa was also solid and came with the standard sauces. Even the papadum was slightly more tasty than normal papadum.The main course was butter chicken (also had the choice of korma), lamb curry (also had the choice of chicken) and a vegetable dish with cauliflower and rice. The butter chicken was super different from any of the other butter chickens I've had. It was pretty sweet - I heard someone at a table next to us describe is as being like maple chicken - but even still I thought it was tasty just different. The lamb curry was standard but also good and the veggie dish was great! We got four pieces (large halves) of naan and it was fresh and warm and very soft. Delicious! Dessert was gulab jamun served warm and tasty. I was so full but luckily it was just one so I'm glad I was able to fit it into my stomach. Mango lassi also good. The people working there were super nice and attentive and I will definitely come back here! They had a lot on their menu and we really love indian food. The only slightly off thing was the combination of sounds that seemed to be going on in the restaurant. My husband described it as ""the soundtrack that you play for someone you're trying to slowly torture."" There was a low indian vocal soundtrack with some sort of 8-bit game music (there were some children in the back playing a game) and then also a ton of frequent cat meows (might have been the game? Couldn't tell.) I didn't notice it at first and it was mostly just really funny to me."

/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Only got to try two items, but still thought it worth writing about quickly: Their Cheese Naan was nice with a decent amount of pull to the dough and cheese combo. Their Basmati rice had some lovely toasted seasoning added (what's that spice called? - it'll come to me), which added a nice touch and made it more memorable than just the plain."

So I came to order some sabzee and daal for the next couple of days so I could take it to work. The staff who works here is a nice guy, I had ordered 4 vegetarian dishes, he gave me rice and one naan complimentary. The food is definitely fresh especially the vegetarian dishes, as I only eat vegetarian food. I have been coming here for two weeks now, unlike some of the other Indian places, this place has a sink and a washroom, In case you decide to wash your hand before eating a thali. The ambience is very average, this place is designed for a take out style place but if you chose to eat here it has the basic amenities one needs. The vegetarian food is fresh, staff are nice, courteous and the prices are reasonable."

The food was cheap but delicious. We got thalis where you get naan and several ""shaks"" (curries or vegetable entrees). As an Indian, this food tasted quite authentic AND they have Indian sodas!! Definitely worth a stop into. I'd frequent this place if I lived near by."

I live near a very large Indian population so I've had a ton of Indian Cuisine and this stuff was phenomenal.Really, I cant sing higher praises.

The butter chicken is very sweet and so is the vegetable korma so I would recommend getting something else (such as vegetables or just other curries) if you prefer a more balanced palette(?). I crave this from time to time and will definitely return."

I like peas but I don't want THAT many peas in my rice. I just want rice.The poppadoms also come rolled up which makes them look nice but they're REALLY hard to eat like that.I just didn't really enjoy any of the food here."

There was no one there at about 8pm. So maybe it's busy at lunch time?Food was already prepared in a counter (cafeteria style). Seemed like it had been sitting there for a while. The server / person behind counter was very rude. Instead of us sampling multiple things and 3-4 of us ordering, we were so put off by the rudeness. Food was mediocre at best. Never again.."

Their butter chicken and naan are the best I've ever seen. Especially the naan bread, perfect thickness and flavor.(I tried 20+ Indian restaurants last year in downtown)AMAZING FOOD, UNBELIEVABLE LOW PRICE, NICE STAFF, RUN THERE!"
/user_details?userid=JOw1k2j0xqU35tRzmBjkEA,Chloe C.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So good! The curry is great, the naan is soft, oily (in a good way) and the price is good especially since it's so filling. I would definitely ask for some extra rice next time since I had a good amount of curry left without anything to accompany it. This place is amazing. Ever since I went to there I keep craving curry!"
/user_details?userid=mZdNkRNZcc2SStIbfyWLjw,Liena C.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I used to come here for the friendly staff (the food is average), but the older man whom I interacted with during my last visit was incredibly rude, got mad and snapped at me when I tried to show him my foodora order number (it was a sequence of letters of numbers, which apparently he wasn't expecting?), then full-on ignored me and didn't say good evening or anything...ok boomer."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: It's a small quiet restaurant. A little bit run-down on the inside. It's not a sit-down restaurant where you can order from a menu. Instead, you order at the counter and it's given to you on a tray.FOOD: The butter chicken was absolutely delicious! Surprisingly, although the chicken pieces seem big, making you believe that it may be dry, that wasn't the case at all. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The curry itself was very creamy, smooth and flavorful as well. The veggie korma wasn't the BEST in my opinion but it was still good. Unfortunately the naan was a little bit burnt but that wasn't too big of a deal. Also, I expected the food to have more spices, especially for an authentic Indian restaurant but it was still good.PRICE: For the area, it's very affordable. Prices range from 1$ (appetizers) to 12$. Definitely worth it.SERVICE: Although it's not your classic waiter service, the worker that prepared the food was very friendly and took the time to explain the different options that were offered."

It is definitely a no frills place, but the food is excellent, the price is right, and it was an excellent lunch. I got the butter chicken platter, which was very tasty. Recommended for fast, friendly service and good taste. It met my craving for a curry house."

I had this amazing flavor memory burning strong in my mind I wanted to tell them about, and could not place where in Charleston I'd had it...and then realized (sadly), it's because it was at Curry Mahal!  Curry Mahal kicks the butt of all the Indian places I have in my town combined. It was so flavorful, fresh, and seemingly authentic. I've never been to India so I can't say for sure...but it seemed really legit.The service was friendly and the price can't be beat.  I would've eaten there again the next day for lunch and dinner if they'd been open."

/user_details?userid=38SGzCuqN3mO6vMTiVEX3w,Raphaella R.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place after seeing all the good reviews and it did not disappoint. It is a small restaurant with a few tables and chairs if you wish to sit down and eat or they also offer take-out/delivery if you live near the area. Very friendly staff ! I tried the vegetarian thali, I loved their naan bread and the vegetarian sauces. My favorite was the vegetable korma, I also enjoyed the zucchini & mixed vegetables. Flavorful with a hint of spicy. On the other hand, the pakora was a bit cold and not the best I tasted, way too thick/too much flour and the rice was bland. The portion of the thali was a bit small so I suggest getting bigger portions if you know what you want to eat. It's definitely worth taking a look."

It's a small family owned restaurant and the woman who owns it is just great. We were here on vacation, we love Indian food but don't have much of it back home. The owner was incredibly helpful with ordering and helping us pick food that we would enjoy. You can tell she truly cares. The food was phenomenal and the whole place smelled amazing. I would definitely recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,I decided to give it a shot on lunch time as I was craving for Indian food. I chose the thaali vegetarian with 3 curries. They were so good!!! Loved the fact that it's like a mini canteen where you're served by the lady who's friendly. The food was good for the price I paid. The place itself is not too bad but just a place to sit but you're coming for the food not for the decor. I left full and happy for my tummy.

The flavors are incredible, and the smells are to die for. The owner is like the mother you wish you had. She genuinely cares about you, and what you'll like. We went in having no idea what to order, she patiently walked us through ordering and checked on us multiple times to make sure everything was great. It was better than great, it was perfect."
/user_details?userid=rrHljXVgFTTwnODS8xKQsg,Maria S.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Our visit for dinner was absolutely wonderful. It's a small restaurant with just a few tables; it looked like most people came in for take-out, but there was also a party of maybe 10 people in the corner as well, so they are very accommodating with the space.My BF and I got the non-vegetarian combo for two, and they were kind enough to point out that the additional chicken samosas we had ordered might not be necessary because the combo comes with 2 veggie samosas; they substituted them for us at a charge less than the order of chicken samosas. Everything was amazing. Absolutely amazing. The crust of the samosas was delectable, the butter chicken was so rich, the cauliflower dish melted in your mouth. The combo came with gulab jaman for dessert and we have plenty of food left over to have lunch for the two of us tomorrow. The atmosphere and treatment by the owners/managers was so warm, attentive, and loving, the fact that the food was phenomenal as well just seemed to complete the package. I don't live in Montreal, but this is definitely my most favourite place EVER to get some wonderful Indian food cooked and served by some of the most beautiful and loving people."

I'm not sure if this is due to the restaurant or the courier or the service itself but it was lightening fast! In about 25-30 minutes I had this delicious array of Indian delightful-ness at my door.I ordered the vegetarian for 1.I knew it came with a few things but I was surprised at how much food actually came. - veggie korma - 3 pakora - lentil soup- palak paneer- rice - naanThank God the BF was home because I could not have eaten it all. Their veggie korma is delicious, samosas are big and filling, and even their rice is cooked perfectly. They sell this all for $16.99 at the restaurant. Everything was flavourful, seasoned, and delicious."

Today is the third time I have picked up takeout from them in two weeks, and as a rule I usually only eat takeout once a month. It's THAT good.I am slowly working my way through the menu, but it's really hard because I like everything I've tasted so much and I just want it again. Like the crispy onion bhajis bursting with flavour... I can't NOT order them. I do not have that kind of willpower. And chana samosa... Do yourself a favour and eat it. The lamb, whatever sauce you choose, is so tender. The naan is epic. The mattar paneer converted my mattar paneer-hating husband into a lover of it, and we both get seriously possessive of leftovers. This food is so good that if you eat it alone you will find yourself speaking aloud, to the food, about how good it is. And asking it questions like, ""How? Why? What is happening in my mouth?"" Don't forget to order raita - you're gonna need it. I feel like the price is reasonable but I always order everything I want and then just eat leftovers for days so I'm not a great source. Shoutout to the super nice owners who are on the ball when it comes to allergies, special requests, and customer service."

First of all, cheers to the 45 minute delivery after being told it would probably be an hour. Also, the delivery man didn't wait at the front entrance, he came all the way to the apartment.To the important things... The food was great. I lived in India for 3 months and this was some of the best Indian food I've had since I've been back. I love Chana masala and I thought this one was very good. Most of the other dishes were not necessarily my favorite I've ever had (for instance I know a place with better tikka masala in my opinion), but every dish was very good. I was a big fan of the rice, and I was glad they gave us a lot.Finally I found all the prices to be VERY reasonable. Two good sized samosas for $3. Most of the dishes were less than $12. (It seemed especially cheap to me given I'm an American and the exchange rate is so good, but still.... I felt like it was a steal.)"

/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Indian Food on the Plateau. Very Affordable, too!Try the Dosas or the Thali. Both are a great value, and as tasty as Indian good gets.The Plateau is challenged for Indian food. There are some really decent places if you want to sit down for a family or date meal, but very little that's quick and affordable. Curry Mahal is both of these things.Whether you're veggie or omnivore, they have plenty of great option. If you haven't had a Dosa (hard to find in Montreal), I'd urge you to try these first. However, if you're looking for something that you're more familiar with, give the thalis a try. And, of course, if you want to go a-la-carte, you can't go wrong."

I love Indian food and savor all the variety and spices. Unfortunately, I didn't find much of that here. The naan and soup were good but otherwise the veggie korma was bland and the chicken tikka was dry and lacking in the soaked-through flavor that I love about the dish.

I've been here either two or three times, all in the winter and each time was worth parallel parking in the snow. Samosa, naan, rice and veggie korma were all out of the park good. You can get your lassi or thumbs from the fridge. The duo behind the counter are super nice and patient. I will say it's chilly because of the direct line of air from the front door, and navigating the bathroom is a bit of a chore...so, wear a sweater and hit the head before you leave the house."

Was able to order online and add some changes, and the order was exactly correct.Order was confirmed in a minute or so, and at the door within 30. Price changed by about a dollar from what it showed me online (but probably because of my requested changes in the comments) - didn't realize till after, so driver accidentally got slightly smaller tip than intended (sorry driver!)Really REALLY good.Perfect. :)"

The food was really very good, and it tasted very homemade Indian. Everything from the chicken to the lamb to the thali everything spot on. We decided to do 2 nights in a row eating at this place. The family that runs the place is just awesome and friendly and they gave my kid a toy to take away. A++"

Wonderful restaurant with the friendliest people. We've spoken with the owners every time we have come and they truly care about their business. We always get the vegetarian thali and it is delicious. Good sized portions and you always leave satiated. But, you should still take a samosa to go."
