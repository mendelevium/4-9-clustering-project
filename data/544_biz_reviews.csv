That's how we found it.  My husband loves poutine, so we ordered the, ""dac biet and Kim-cheesy"" poutine. We fell in love with the Kim-cheesy.  Fresh cheese curds and really good Kim chi.   We ordered it 4 times that weekend. Hahaha the dac biet was okay.  I wouldn't order it again.  Keep up the great job guys   The restaurant was always packed every night and had good loud music.  The owners actually said hi and introduced themselves to us while we were waiting for our food. Since we ordered out.  I don't think this place would be kid friendly. Definitely a hipster place."
