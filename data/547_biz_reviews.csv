The place was pretty empty, with only one other table taken. There was sanitizer at the entrance and servers were wearing masks, and the bathrooms upstairs were available for handwashing. The menus have both an english and french side. Prices are reasonable, more expensive than a fastfood burger, with the original coming in at 13 dollars. Theres also the option to create your own burger. Â My dining companion had the original with the fries. It comes with a pickle too, which was super sour. The fries were a bit bland despite the pepper...they needed more salt. I got the poutine but replaced the fries with sweet potato fries. It wasn't the best combo but that's on me for being indecisive about which one i wanted and combining the two. The fries themselves were great, nice and crispy and thin. The gravy is vegetarian and not too salty and a good consistency. My only complaint is that the gravy was not hot enough. The top of the poutine where the cheese was was literally cool. The cheese curds also didn't have that squeak. Next time I'd just get the normal poutine or the swet potato fries alone."
