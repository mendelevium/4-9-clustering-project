/user_details?userid=GF3PD-i-3BGmlRKxjhN-rg,Diana N.,"Edgewater, NJ",5 star rating,"Calling all chocolate lovers...We don't have anything like this stateside - A casual sit-down all-chocolate dessert shop. So, we have to try it when we visited Montreal! Everything from the smoked chocolate drink to Le Brownie S'mores and Chocolate Fondant was perfectly chocolately. It was sweet but not too sweet, and the chocolate was dark enough for my liking but not too dark that it's bitter.Service was great, the servers were attentive and prompt. They also spoke English for us. If I lived in Montreal, I would definitely visit Juliette & Chocolat on the regular!"
/user_details?userid=cNYGGU79oQtR_xBSz6ZbvA,Ajara B.,"Sandy Hill, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,Warning: you will want to get everything on their menu because everything sounds so appealing and it will in fact not disappoint you! They are famous for their ice cream and it is the cutest thing you will ever eat. Their food presentation is amazing so you will just want to sit there and stare at your food (jk).Their potions are minuscule - the only thing that was disappointing but because it is so sweet you kind of don't need much.
/user_details?userid=hqMM_ipipdkxB8M9BfXYNQ,Lisa T.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,I decide to check this place out while visiting Montréal. The selection of chocolate dishes are endless. The service was quite slow and took a while to get the servers attention. We had the chocolate banana cookie which was ok and I wish it was warmer. The hot chocolate was so rich and definitely took me two days to finish. It literally is melted chocolate in a cup and the marshmallows were great. The hazelnut cake was my favorite out of all that I ate.
/user_details?userid=1aZddwS-_bXP355WnDl7tQ,Karl B.,"Centreville, VA",5 star rating,Juliette and Chocolat was the perfectly warm and inviting place to get a nice evening desert on a bitter cold January night. The menu was confusing to me but the waitress explained everything. The ice cream was excellent.
/user_details?userid=zV3PESBiRxRHODli1ZlHww,Aline T.,"CA, CA",5 star rating,"Another dessert place in Montreal that is a must to try. I'm a huge chocoholic so clearly this was on my list. After a very hard deliberation flipping through the dessert pages, I got the le fondant aí chocolat, which simply put is what Americans call lava cake, but it tastes nothing like a lava cake. The similarity really is just than when you cut the cake, the chocolate pours out. The quality of the chocolate is just indescribable. I opted for the hazelnut ice cream and a milk chocolate ""shot"" to go wtih it. The ice cream was extremely creamy and though it's a bit too sweet towards the end because I did go into chocolate overload, the milk chocolate that I poured over the ice cream plus the cake were simply amazing. There are a few locations, so if you have a sweet tooth, definitely try this place! I dont think you'll regret it if you love chocolate!"

Either way, the stroll the the neighborhood is much more pleasant when sipping on the drink of the gods. I didn't try the rest of the menu, which looked appetizing. If you love chocolate, stop by you won't be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=LHssgtN65t9hyiiMxGg1vg,Koorosh Z.,"Woodland Hills, CA",5 star rating,"One of the best sundaes I've ever had, and I used to work in an ice cream joint when I was a kid. But it's so much more than ice cream, it's chocolate heaven for sure, and all the delightful chocolate treats we tried were beyond exceptional, they were superlative. This place was a high end chocolate version of Farrell's. I felt like a grownup kid in a candy/chocolate/old school ice cream parlor. I fell in love with this place instantly. It pains me to see it's only a 4 star, this is soooo misleading, this place needs a SOLID 5 stars. Everything on everyone's plate was of the highest caliber and quality. It is so obvious the love of the craft of chocolate they have here. If you want to eat dessert perfection, look no further. Juliette and Chocolat is perfection!!!Merci!!"

We went here the past two nights to satisfy our late night chocolate craving. The first night we went, I ordered the classic hot chocolate with 72% dark chocolate and almond milk, best hot chocolate I've ever had! I even had to buy the hot chocolate powder mix. My friend ordered the chocolate fondue for one and it was very delicious. The second night she ordered the marshmallow madness hot chocolate. It was also very good, but very thick. She couldn't finish it all. I ordered the Le fondant Speculoos with hazelnut ice cream and a side of caramel sauce. The hazelnut ice cream was mind blowingly good and the cookie butter lava cake was a nice twist on the classic chocolate molten lava cake!"

They have several locations scattered all around the city and I always like this one on St Laurent on Prince Arthur because it is a fun location with great people watching. My friend and I ended up getting a sundae and a popsicle- things we had not gotten before- and while these were good, I think we will stick to what we usually order which are the brownies and the fondue. Service was okay- felt a little slow as it seems like there was one person for an entire side of the restaurant (which was big!)."

I decided to go on a Sunday night and the place was packed. the whole interior is very cute and it looks like a cafe with the waiters dressed in red and white with a big chef hat. so adorable! we were quickly seated for a table of 8 and given a beautiful menu with both English and French which is great for tourists ! we chose to get the strawberry fields to share between two and it was around $13 the crepe was one of the best I've had with how thin the crepe was, the sweet and crunchy strawberries, white chocolate in the crepe, creamy and light whipped cream and sweet rich French vanilla ice cream . the perfect dessert! it was great for a light dessert to share with two :) I love that they have a great assortment of dishes and all of us left satisfied with what we got from fondue to cake to brownies. I would love to have stayed at Montreal longer to try more from this menu. the service was great and so friendly and the waitress even sparked conversations with us. a great spot for tourists and locals"

The menu was incredible. We had to stop in so we just had room for a cookie and some coffee.

/user_details?userid=rFR3fyOU1MSyIRcb6oiRmQ,Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5 star rating,"Amazing dessert bar/restaurant!! So many options it was so hard to choose! I can't believe anyone would give this place less than 5 stars, the desserts are incredible!We had a heavy dinner so we wanted to share a smaller dessert. But I wish we saved room because their sundaes and fondue looked amazing. They have small deserts in a jar so we went with the black forest cake jar. The jar was plenty for both of us to share first because we were pretty full but also because the cream was very rich and flavorful. There was vanilla cream and chocolate cream with a layer of cherry jelly in the middle and chocolate shavings on top. So good!! They also had delicious looking crepes so we will definitely try that next time! Heads up, get ready to spend a little more on dessert when you come here. For the quality of food you get it is totally worth it, though!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",3 star rating,"3.5This is a solid dessert spot for any day of the week! It's open until 11 PM, and has such an amazing line up of chocolate-y good desserts. Juliette is definitely a Montreal staple for dessert, and they have 3 locations. The menu also includes some savoury items which I got to try as well. The menu is a whopping 19 pages long! It took me so long to decide what I wanted to get because everything looked so good! I finally decided on the farmhouse crepe (and substituted mushrooms instead of chicken) and the chocolate mouse sea salt petit pot, b/c how could I go to Juliette's without having something chocolatey. The food was prepared quite efficiently once the order was put in, but the service was a bit slow to start. I signalled to the waiter we were ready to order and he acknowledged but decided to continue to talk to his colleague for 2 minutes...a minor thing. The food was really good though I have to say, and I need to come back to try more. However, one surprise thing was they charged me more for substituting mushrooms without informing me. Again another minor thing. In all, the food and nice ambience makes up for the service which really wasn't all that bad. I'll definitely be back excited to try more!"
/user_details?userid=nminzwEhUiXjow_5gbz4ow,Amber S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Got the ham and Swiss crepe with Bechamel. Crepe was delicious and very filling, not too much sauce either - just the right amount for a meal. The side salad it came with had way too much dressing though. I upgraded my meal to come with a crepe and coffee and asked them to ice the coffee since it's summer. It was delicious! Will be back next time I am in Montreal.Ps: try the ice cream. I got a side scoop - it was really good :)"

I ordered a delicious treat called ""The Cafe Gourmand"" (a single espresso served with sweet whipped cream, a small chocolate lava cake, a small raspberry cheesecake, and a bite size fleur de sel brownie) Great atmosphere. Open fairly late. In the middle of a great town with lots of restaurants. Great servers."

It feels like it has probably lost some of its quality with time and additional locations. I ended up getting a trifle, which was certainly not bad, but didn't seem special in my opinion. I would say not worth the price at the very least."

My friends and I were just strolling down this cute road looking for a coffee or pastry, and stumbled upon this fantastic dessert café! There is nothing like this where I am from, this was definitely a one of a kind experience! I ordered the hot chocolate, it was like drinking chocolate! The menu is so long that they definitely have an option for everyone! The waiter was so nice and friendly, and there was plenty of seating and barely any wait for a table or food."

/user_details?userid=GUMV1seXc5-JjlodoDO3Cw,Alejandra F.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"Juliette & Chocolat comes up as a great dessert spot for a first timer in Montreal. Having gone twice in the last few months I suggest you save your money. Tonight, we came in and there was no wait. We were seated after 5 mins when someone finally came to seat us, our order was taken 10 minutes later... we ordered 2 hot chocolates and a fondue. The order took 50 MINUTES to arrive- once it did arrive we were given not one but TWO dirty cups for our hot chocolate. They were taking so long to get to us I ended up walking up to a waiter myself to ask for new cups for our hot chocolate. The cups were gross- there was a colored liquid inside them when we got them which already spoiled the meal. The loooong wait time for getting seated, getting our order, and the lack of cleanliness created an experience worthy of 1 star at most.Note that this is my second time at this chain (my first visit was in another neighborhood) and I had the same issues with cleanliness of eating utensils and wait time. I decided to give it another chance in the Plateau, but this place is such a disappointment. Save your money and go elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=cJCYCEfDL4n5TgU9y8RTWg,Allister D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3 star rating,"This chocolate shop has a great concept but the process and service is just way too slow I think. Me and my friend stopped in and sat for two orders of hot chocolates but we ended up waiting about 45 mins. It was ridiculous. We barely got checked at or had our waters refilled. The speed cannot keep up with the process and booming crowd. By the time we got our drinks, we were already slightly upset and just drawn away. My hot chocolate was just ok; too much whipped cream on top. My friend's camp fire plate with brownies and marshmallows was legit looking and was neatly presented but overall, our experience ended up being a downfall."

It was still good, but it wasn't for me.The only thing I didn't like was that some of the dishes were chipped. Everything else was great!"

I've died and gone to Chocolate Heaven!I think we went into chocolate overindulgence overload in this place while visiting Montreal. It was too damn close to our hotel. Could not resist coming here a few times for lunch and a late night sugary snack. I think I caught the beetus here.Heck, just the smell alone wafting out the door here is intoxicating.Nice French inspired bakery/bistro decor. Terrific service. Super variety of items on the menu to eat and drink. Savory crepes, dessert crepes, frozen chocolate drinks, hot chocolate drinks, and so much more to put you into a chocolate coma. Forget the diet when dropping in here. Just go off on a rich chocolate feast. The menu has so many chocolate options on it you have a hard time deciding on just one. Everything we tried was prepared well.If you are a chocolate lover this is a must visit when in the area.Just give me an insulin shot and all will be ok!"

Order a molten lava cake...u pour the chocolate in the center. We ordered the crepe with bananas and strawberries. It was served open and we picked the milk chocolate....not the nuttela one. They have waffles , trifles, banna splits..all loaded with real chocolate sauce...For the ultimate choco lovers...they even serve chocolate in brandy glasses and have a tasting menu for them. Lol.

/user_details?userid=NJYmDwbokNAqjdUpYPJhEg,Rabail A.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would happily do so. It's a chocolate heaven. We honestly drive from Toronto to eat this yummy goodness. First of all the servers are lovely people dressed in cute little hats. They always smile, talk to you and ask about your experience. I even met Julliete once and told her that I came from Toronto and she gave me a box full of her goodies! Grandma style hot chocolate is a must. It's thick and velvety, appropriately sweet and will leave you craving for more. The marshmallows are in house made and are unlike anything you will ever have. The brownies are rich, chewy and addictive.The yummy goodness in the pots (salted caramel petit etc.) literally melt in your mouth and you feel like you are having a food orgasm. My personal favourite is the milk chocolate crepe. I kid you not when I say I lick my plate afterwards to get every single bit of that chocolate in my belly. The chocolate cookie has nuts inside which compliment it really well. The praline bomb is perfection. I honestly have tears of joy in my eyes every time I come here and eat the food."

My wife got a Nutella Crepe and I got a cookie and Nutella milk. What can I say, it's dessert, it was pretty good. The cookie was filled with chocolate and almonds. It was soft and tasted great. The crepe had strawberries and Nutella. My wife thought the crepe was, ""pretty good, about the same as if you make it at home.""

As I walked in, I noticed this group of people in the back whipping and chocolate syruping their hearts out. I walk to them and immediately they read my mind. My first time in Montreal, they recommended the cheesecake trifle.Layers of fudgy dark chocolate brownie chunks, hazelnut praline cream, luscious cheesecake sauce and sweet whipped cream, served with velvety thick dark hot chocolate.Yes, you read that correctly. So good, that I convinced the group to attend for brunch the next day. Sweet deal. Along with your meal, their brunch comes with:* A choice of café au lait, or chocolaccino, or tea* A glass of orange juice* A small homemade seasonal cake* Unsweetened yogurt with homemade seasonal fruit compote and our gourmet chocolate granolaDefinitely a great choice if you're visiting the city."

Delicious. The s'mores brownie has a gooey salted caramel interior that had us scraping the plate with our spoons. No complaints here, other than the service, which was absurd.

/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"This place gets the worst review I can possibly give not because of the food but because of the sanitation and service (or should I say attitude). Are you ready, here we go:We were sited in the back, so we could actually see the kitchen window, which is the place the waiters go to pick up the food. What we saw gave us the chill. If you order one of their crap you also get a small side salad. We saw one of the waiters pick up the leaves with his hand and put them in the bowl before taking the order to the table. Each time he picked an order he would open the crap (with his hands) to double check the type, again a waiter not a kitchen staff. When I told our waiter, this is an issue (I was also complaining that most of our orders where cold since we saw our orders, and others, waiting for 15 min at the window and getting cold) he asked if I wanted to talk to the guy in-charge. I said yes, guess who is the boss? The same guy that was touching the food with his hands. His defence? I am always washing my hands. I told him I trust him and I am sure he washes his hands after the toilet but between orders he is handling money, carrying dishes and other costumers related issues. I also explained that in a normal place only kitchen staff are allowed to touch the food that's a basic health rule. He said no I am washing my hands each time I go to the window. I saw him carrying stuff from the kitchen to the tables every few minutes, so either he is a lair, or he washes his hands each time and that might explain the slow service since half of his shift is washing hands. I love Juliette Chocolate but will NEVER visit this location ever again and I argue you not to as well."

Our day was full.The sun had set in our hearts and everything was the way things needed to be.My wife had the 65% Cacao Peru. That was more like a candy bar than the 80% Uganda.It was also wonderful.Her sun set in a different place in the west than mine did but it was a lovely delightful place too.Technically they offer a sampler of three different chocolates served on a wooden tray in three different snifters.It would be a night of love with first Taylor Swift, then Scarlett Johansson, then Jessica Biel.You could do that - but each successive experience would undercut what went before.Take just one snifter and be happy.Save the other treats for another time.* * *And yes they have regular hot cocoa and milkshakes and lots of other stuff.The world is full of wonderful things.But sometimes just one wonderful thing is all you need to find contentment."

We were ignored for almost 20 minutes before anyone came to even greet us - it was a Thursday afternoon and the place was empty. However, our desserts were nothing short of amazing. I had the banana & salted caramel crepe, topped with toasted hazelnuts and vanilla ice cream. My mouth is watering just writing this review. The crepe was light, the caramel sauce was the perfect balance between sweet & salty, and the crunch from the hazelnuts amplified the flavors. My boyfriend had a Werecookie with vanilla ice cream. The Werecookie is a chocolate chip cookie with a molten chocolate center. The cookie was soft, gooey and delicious."

They are everywhere so when your sweet tooth craving hits you, you have a great place to stop at and subdue that craving.

Quick service, friendly staff and when you walk in you just feel like you're inside a box of chocolate because it smells so delicious! I can only speak on their crêpes so here I go, do not let the thinnest of their crêpes fool you into thinking that it won't be filling, have a light to decent meal before and then indulge on their dessert because I can guarantee that it would be hard for your to move afterwards (for good reasons) Honestly this is a good place for late night conversations with friends, date night, or just plain ""a want something sweet and delicious"", this is it ladies and gents #chocolate"

They're known for their buckwheat crepe but all the buckwheat crepe options were savory. I asked my server if the Nutella crepe can be made with buckwheat and she said yes so we got that and a mini hazelnut popsicle. Although there were two of us, the server only gave us one place setting so we had to ask for another set of napkins, fork and knife. The crepe is huge and definitely can be shared by two. The hazelnut popsicle is good and I'd get it again.It was my fault for changing the dish, but the buckwheat nutella crepe was not good at all. I've had buckwheat crepe before but forgot to specify that I like the crepe softer. Theirs was very hard and bitter. Also i found out when I got the bill that she charged me extra for getting buckwheat without telling me when I ordered."

Service 2/5: The service was slow, def not somewhere to go if you're rushing. We wanted to have a quick simple lunch and were stuck for 2 hours even though the restaurant was less than half full. The bathrooms were also not very well kept as there was toilet water all over the floor.Cleanliness 1/5: Absolutely everything was dirty. My tea glass had chocolate all over the outside, the cutlery was dirty, the water glasses had white and black stuff floating inside and my friends cup had tea leaves in it. Drinks 1/5: My friend ordered the Vienna hot chocolate and it was like drinking melted ice cream. It was way too thick and sweet. I had the creme earl grey tea which was very watery no matter how long I let it steep and they only had ""dairy milker"", no real cream or milk.Food 3/5: I ordered the Mexitalian crepe which had tomatoes, guac and bocconcini on a buckwheat crepe. It was not bad but not amazing. My boyfriend got the pop eye salad which had fresh veggies but the chicken was bland and dry (very clearly frozen). However, my meal came with a chocolate dessert crepe and that was delicious!"

Waited for 20 minutes after being seated to have someone take our order and only after I waived them over. Then waited another 30 minutes for a very underwhelming crepe and dessert bowl. The place was not busy and seemed to have plenty of staff standing around talking. We watched table after table try and waive down their server so they could pay and leave. Each time they just got up and went to the counter to pay. Would not recommend this place at all.

The cafe was much larger than I had expected and it was more of a sit down deserts restaurant. The place was loud and lively, and was perfect for our raining evening. I didn't find the deserts to be exceptional, and were too sweet and way too dense in my opinion. In retrospect I would have gotten a lighter drink or a crepe of some sort. I ordered the Petit Pot praline-caramel but the waiter got the order wrong and served a different one instead. They did catch it soon enough and brought me the correct order though and were very apologetic about it. Otherwise their service was great and quick fast. This may be a place for all you sweet tooths out there but is not somewhere I see myself returning to."

All the ingredients just blended well togetherHazelnut praline bomb: I was expecting this to be a heavy dessert by the looks but don't be fooled.

I've had crepes before, both sweet and savory, and I didn't like them at all; the texture of these crepes always repelled me - too rubbery and weird for me. But this crepe was absolutely perfect - warm, fluffy, and soft but also CRISPY, not rubbery! My sister loves hazelnut and gives this crepe 5 stars too, so yeah, you gotta get this! Chocolate milkshake (55% chocolate) was heavenly too. SO deep and rich, thick and syrupy. I would say it's slightly more bitter than sweet, so it's a matter of preference - just keep that in mind."

There are so many different kind of desserts on the menu to choose from! Me and my friend ordered a Chocolate Fondant, a Millefeuille in a jar, a pot of Moon tea and a pot of Green tea and peony.The Fondant we got was served with 70% melted chocolate and hazelnut ice cream. It was warm and rich. The ice cream also taste really good. Me and my friend love it! The Millefeuille was super tasty too! The vanilla curd and the Bavarian cream were super nice!! This is the good choice for someone who doesn't like  dessert that is too sweet.For the two tea we got, the green tea and peony is really nice if you are someone who like floral scent. On the other side, the moon tea was the only thing we don't like. It smells fruity, however the aftertaste of the tea reminds us of the liquid medicine we both had when we were little. Not sure why but it's a no for us. Overall, me and my friend really enjoy our stay at this cozy cafe.

I came here super late and they close at 11pm so if you ever need to satisfy a craving come in for some food! I came in at 10:40pm and they were only serving brownies at this time. I got the caramel sel de fleur brownie and it was soooo good. My mouth was watering when I first saw it. There was sauce (salted caramel) that was on the side that you could pour over onto your brownie. The only downside to Juliette and Chocolat is that it can be a bit overpriced for some of the things you get. The total bill came to $7/8. It's good to come here once in a while!! It's also good for birthday celebrations and generally large groups of people!The second time I came here I got the crepe. It was too good to describe.

Very large inside with a grab-and-go counter and many tables along the windows. You won't be disappointed with the chocolates. There were gluten free, but I don't think there were vegan options. The chocolate cubes are a must-try. You can buy them at the counter. Dark chocolate on the outside and a sugar-marinated fruit peel with a denser half layer of chocolate/caramel/peanut butter on the inside. The La Vie En Rose cake was not that great - very dry and tasted nothing like a macaron, as I was told. If you buy any items to go, they will package each treat so nicely - individually in plastic sleeves, then in a gift bag. We didn't try the menu options here, but if you've ever had Cacao 70 in Toronto and liked the chocolate dipped fruits and waffles or large milkshakes, you'll definitely like it here!"

My boyfriend ordered le fleur de sel which is a salted caramel brownie and I ordered a marshmallow explosion drink.The brownie was SO good; we still think about it back in Toronto. The drink was not as good probably because it was a mixed of dark and milk chocolate. The marshmallow is supposedly made in house but it was nothing special in my opinion. The brownie was a perfect blend of sweet and savoury. Whenever I get salt and caramel desserts, I feel that it's unbalance and some bites are too sweet or too salty.

As such, I thought I was going to just try one bite of the strawberry, banana, chocolate crepe that was presented. It was a taste explosion! INCREDIBLE! I wished I had a large piece of crepe, it was so good! Then, I mentioned to our tour guide that I had heard that Quebec was known for hot chocolate and asked him where he would go to get it? He said ""Here""! He warned me that when I ordered it, I should ask for the beverage with the milk, otherwise I might get a cup of melted chocolate. He was not wrong! It was AMAZING! They actually melt chocolate and then put milk in it. It had the consistency of a loose pudding! I've never seen anything like it! I imagine this is how hot chocolate started out in the olden days and was intended to be! Having had this, I will never go back to drinking Swiss Miss or Nestle. I imagine their corporate officers must laugh at us all when we drink their watery powder mix! This was my favorite stop on our tour! It is a must see!"

The brownies didn't go well with the fondue because it was just way too sweet but everything else was fine. I also got the grandma's style hot chocolate in semisweet dark chocolate and it was really rich and foamy but after a couple sips it was just undrinkable- it tasted essentially like melted chocolate and it was way too thick.

I was really disappointed that the waffle wasn't warm/fresh - isn't the point of a waffle being homemade at a dessert restaurant, that it will be freshly made? The ice cream, chocolate sauce and pearl balls were tasty. The pearl balls however were in a mini bowl that was very clearly chipped badly. His: ""Medley Chocolat"" - Vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownie. Extremely rich brownie, closer to the consistency of fudge than typical brownies - he enjoyed it. It also came with a bitter chocolate ganache that had a coffee-type aftertaste.Lemonade ice tea: decent, nothing special. Total was $26 after tax / before tip.

Even though I couldn't afford the calories we decided to also get the lemon meringue crepe since the waiter told us it's delicious. Our white chocolate fondue was not as good as I expected. The white chocolate did not have a ton of flavor. We ordered the dish that came with strawberries, bananas, waffles and brownies for dipping. The brownies were amazing but the waffles were terrible. First they were burnt so we had to send them back. They brought us a new set and they were extremely oily and tasted deep fried. I ate one and couldn't handle anymore. If you're going to get fondue I would suggest the fruit only. Our other order, the lemon meringue crepe was to die for! It was one of the best crepes I have ever eaten.

You won't decide what to eat immediately, it will take a few moments and perhaps a sip of one of their many artisanal hot chocolates to help your decision along.The serivce was quirky. I couldn't tell if our waiter was just ridiculously polite or flirting with my friend and I. Perhaps it was his quasi-Franco-European allure, or his giant pearly white smile, with an oh so slight arch of the eyebrow?  Perhaps he had a small family to feed and relied on the big tips American women would leave. Either way, I digress, enough about him. I came for dessert only and had some sort of layed concoction of dark chocolate and caramel in a petite mason jar. Rich, tasty and thick. Definitely worth the indulgence. I also picked one of the spicy hot chocolates which to me, didn't have much kick at all.

Well J&C is so extreme that they offer chocolate tasting. Just so we are clear, they offer glasses filled with some molten chocolate that you can drink. They also offer, much in the same fasion as a wine or beer tasting, a flight of different molten chocolates. To be honest, I didn't try it but it looked awesome! Wait time for the food were was lengthy at around 20-25 minutes but wow, the food was good. On their own, my Banana boat waffles were great but the combination of caramel and bananas was just so tasty.

This time I ordered the hot chocolate with house made marshmallows and caramel fondant with ice cream. WOW - the caramel fondant has become my new favourite. Perfection in every bite - Sweet, but not sickening sweet. Portion size was just right. Pairing with ice cream is a very good idea. As for the hot chocolate - again, very thick and delicious. It's sweetness level is just right for my partner and I. I really liked those marshmallows too. Very soft and warm. My partner treated me, and he was telling me how good the price is for such good food (It just became his new favourite dessert place)."

It's a very veryoverpriced place and the portions are no bigger than one mouthful of dessert . All the desserts there are like that . I see that the place has a high star rating but I am truly baffled by this . It's probably due to the fact that the place looks nice and the one bite that you get , does taste good . But remember , it's ONE bite . Literally !!!!  ....... Followed by a 100 bite wallet grab"

Service was poor. And it wasn't the servers' fault. There were only three of them on the floor w no host or bussers. They were doing everything. The food was equally as underwhelming. My Squirrel Crepe was cold and had trace amounts of Nutella in it. My husband's hot chocolate was far from hot. The homemade marshmallows were cloyingly sweet. His brownie was above average. Overall, management clearly needs to be present on the floor and more mindful w scheduling. Also ditch the silly red hats and uniforms."
/user_details?userid=AZc_iAzLGLkzGPZ_7zKL4Q,Tiffany K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Having never tried nor heard of this shop, I thought this would be a typical chocolate cafe in which their desserts do not live up to its name. If the store claims to specialize in chocolate, they better serve legit high quality chocolate and this place did just that! Located at the corner of Boul St-Laurent and Rue Prince Arthur O, this cafe looked extremely bright, inviting and cozy especially from the outside of a cold December night. The inside was very spacious with ample seatings for large and small groups. The menu offered a diverse choice of chocolate in forms of hot/cold drinks, alcoholic beverages, cakes, brownies, crepes and waffles. For the dark chocolate vintage tasting in wine glass, they offered three chocolate from around the world: Peru 65% of cocoa, Uganda 80% and Mangaro 65%. The dark chocolate was creamy, thick and extremely unique in taste. The Peru dark chocolate was the sweeter one of the three, whereas Uganda was very bitter and Mangaro carried a hint of citrus. I wasn't able to taste any hints of earth, mushrooms, mango or gingerbread as described in the menu but it certainly was an interesting and fun experience trying and comparing the taste of cocoa grown in different parts of the world. I highly recommend sharing this tasting with a larger group and asking the server for individual spoons when tasting to avoid ""contaminating"" the chocolate. *All chocolate drinks vintages are gluten free as well.The brownie kebab was a bit of a let-down. Of the 5 different brownie flavours, I only remember peanut butter, salted caramel, classic nut and this banana flavoured one. The brownies were dry and even hard, often crumbling into pieces when I forked it. Since I'm not a brownie fan to begin with, I didn't find this dish particularly special or tasty. The crepe with nutella and banana was a hit though! The crepe was thin and chewy which I loved. To conclude, this chocolate shop deserves 4 stars for its ambiance, many chocolatey options and overall deliciousness! It's the perfect spot for chocolaholics and dessert lovers!"

Service was a bit lacking though, as our server was always nowhere to be found, but there was usually someone else around to find our guy.  Now for the food: I got the strawberry crepe with chocolate and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream. It was pretty good, nothing too special. But this review isn't about the crepe - it's all about the BROWNIE.OMG the brownie. I'm not big on sweets and usually don't care much for brownies. But Juliette et Chocolat is known for their chocolate and their brownies, so I decided to split one with my friend after having my crepe, and I was so glad I did. We got the intense brownie and it was amazing. It was warm and moist and oh so delicious.  Next time I would come back to try their other brownies and a hot chocolate.

Multiple locations - we went to the one on St Laurent. Easy to spot in the corner- large sigh and patio. You can smell the sweetness from a block a way. Chocolatiers have not only mastered the sweet they have also done well with savory. This was the first stop of Montreal for my friend ( her first time in Montreal) and they didn't disappoint. We ordered brunch: I the spinach /buckwheat crepe with sunny side egg and my friend the Turkey. Be aware they do have gluten free options but their crepes are made with Buckwheat. We each tried some form of chocolate latte and then after some time of easy chatter and digestion we shared the Tiramisu. Best brunch experience ever! Can definitely purchased goods to go as they have great fondue sets. St Laurent location was large and I have been to St Denis location- small but quaint - still the same yummy smell and ambience of each!

Good place for girl meet ups.Their crepes are big, but not thick and raw. It's thin yet big enough to cover your whole plate. Might have been a bit too thin actually. Tried the nutella, banana and strawberry; whole crepe was covered in strawberries and banana goodness. The presentation was pretty too.Their petit pot de fleurs are pretty cute; a nice treat for someone or just to enjoy for yourself. I wouldn't recommend enjoying at the restaurant though as there are many other 'fresh' things to order. The fleur de sel and chocolate ganache was very rich, so the portion they give is pretty good.If you want something a little fancier go to Juliette; if you're just into CHOCOLATE in general, Cacao is a must visit."

The shop is clean and well lit with defined areas for dining in, having a quick coffee, or purchasing items from the bakery case.On our first visit, my friend had the Juliette sampler, a plate with a bite of five different desserts. I ordered a Viennese coffee and the intense brownie. The coffee was delicious - hot and flavorful with an abundance of real whipped cream and a dark chocolate drizzle. The brownie... I can't even begin to describe the sinful richness. It was as if every taste bud had an orgasm.On our other visit, my friend had the sundae and was quite satisfied. I initially intended to have the intense brownie again, but then I noticed something even better: the intense brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate ganache. It. Was. HEAVENLY. The brownie was warm, so the ice cream was melting into it. The ganache was perfectly rich without being cloyingly sweet.

Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was lively and busy but didn't feel cramped.I have three minor criticisms: one, I wish both of our chocolates came out a little warmer; two, our orders did not come out at the same time and I was almost halfway done with mine before my wife's came out; and three - Montreal is freezing at night, and yes, I get it ladies, your thin stockings you wear while going to the nearby clubs aren't doing much to warm your legs, but the line out the door gradually turned into people holding both sets of doors open in an attempt to warm themselves - thus freezing everyone else.

Maybe I've been overly pampered by other creperies where I've had chunks of the savory meat inside, but to have deli meat inside a crepe?! Get the heck out.  If I wasn't disappointed enough from the soup, this was most definitely the coup-de-grâce of the evening.  Other than that, the buckwheat crepe itself was crisp and delicious, but the filling continued to do nothing for me the rest of the night.On the only bright side I can find, the dessert was truly spectacular.  I had the tiramisu and it was the most coffee-flavored tiramisu I've ever had, smacking you in the face with that rich espresso flavor.  Major kudos for an excellent pastry chef, but man oh man, they've got to do something about their savory dishes.  For a place as hoity-toity as this, they should certainly be able to do better."

I don't know if I was expected to go make my meal on my own or what...Anyway, our waitress took about 30 minutes to serve us. After the food came out, she literally disappeared. We waited for about two hours, after continuously asking others servers for the bill. FINALLY, the fourth server that we asked managed to track down our waitress and get us water before I literally died of thirst. Conveniently, our waitress decided to be super accommodating for about 2 minutes in order to (I'm assuming) rack in a decent tip. Just go to another location, the awful service here isn't even worth it."

I feel its unfair for someone like me who doesn't have a sweet tooth to comment on this place but here goes...I was at this place with two people who love chocolate, on of them being Mr. H. We walk in and there was a little bit of a wait to be seated. I was shocked at the number of people who came here to eat a meal of chocolate! We sat down and were given the very large menu of options. It was a bit too much of me so we went with a sampler and Mr. H tried the Peru chocolate drink. The sampler was the perfect size and we got to try a bit of everything. It had fondue with some brownie (the brownie was superb!) and some fruit. There was also a small crepe, a profiterole and some vanilla ice-cream served with whip cream. The ice-cream with whip cream was the most in quantity and it was also what was eaten the least. It was nothing special and I would much rather have had a larger portion of the brownie (somehow in platters the also serve more of the mediocre dish). Mr. H did not enjoy his Peru as much, I think it was too fruity for him (it says its fruity! hello!). I think I would have enjoyed this place much more had I come after dinner and not middle of the day. The chocolate fondue was not the best I've had but the brownie was really good. I don't know if this is a place I would crave to go to again, maybe if I wanted to try the crepes I might.PS: i still can't get over people coming here for dinner!?

So of course the first place we checked to find crepes was yelp and they suggested Juliette et Chocolat. Juliette et Chocolat is a lovely modern cafe with lots and lots of chocolate all around.  It looked like everyone had a pot of chocolate! Being a chocoholic...I was excited indeed! Both my hubby and I ordered crepes with strawberries but when I was scanning the menu, the trifle caught my eye.  The crepes were ok...I thought the crepes would be folded into a triangle but it was like a large crepe with chocolate spread on top and sliced strawberries on the chocolate.  Nothing special. And to be honest, the strawberries weren't ripe but then again, it's February....not July so really I guess it couldn't be helped! The trifle on the other hand was absolutely the best thing I put into my mouth that weekend.  I am still dreaming about this trifle to this day.  It was basically layers of brownie, fleur de sel caramel, whipped cream and then you pour hot chocolate overtop.  AMAZING! Every single component of this dessert was heavenly.  I was never one to really like whipped cream (I immensely disliked the one on Chinese cakes growing up) but then I started making my own whipped cream and realized how good it tastes...and the whipped cream at Juliette et Chocolat was like that whipped cream...homemade and fresh! SO good! The five stars is honestly for the trifle...it was that good.  I will definitely be going back there to put some more heavenly trifle into my mouth!"

The next visit I had the Sundae, which includes brownies, vanilla ice cream, bananas and strawberries with a mountain of whipped cream on top. It was a meal in itself!

I tried the chocolate fondue for 2 set with my family and it was a very generous assortment of fruits, brownies, waffles and marshmallows to dip in super rich and thick chocolate fondue that melted in your mouth and gave you a little sugar coma with every bite. Very tasty but really decadent and powerful as well. I also tried a pure Aztec chocolate drink made in the ancient way with water that was believed to give strength. A rich and spicy flavour, almost like cinnamon or ginger spice with that antioxidant flavour but still creamy and smooth as it poured down my throat.

We stopped in for a late-night dessert, and thought we'd get a quick sweet crepe, and maybe a brownie to go along with it.A host quickly approached us upon our arrival and sat us down at a table. Either by our deer-in-the-headights look, or my saying, ""Hello,"" immediately upon entering, he could tell that we only spoke English (however much we wished we spoke French), and he handed us their English menu.After looking over our choices we asked our waitress for the Dulce de Leche and Pear crepe, and The Peanut brownie.Service was fast, and we received our crepe only 5 minutes later. As soon as we looked at our crepe we were both disappointed. They used canned pears!! The corn syrup soaked, grainy textured, pears were accompanied by a caramel that seemed to just be mixed with milk, since you couldn't taste the Dulce de Leche at all, and the caramel drizzle was hardly enough to bring any flavor back to our washed out crepe.The brownie had the distinct flavor of being from a box. Rather than the rich cocoa an butter flavor of a freshly baked brownie, all we could taste was a syrupy flavor (which we simply presumed was more corn syrup, though we may be wrong). The peanut butter that came in the brownie was not fresh tasting, but had more of a Jiffy flavor.Although some of the service we great, and we really liked how the host intuited that we were English-speakers, we can't recommend this place as somewhere someone should eat."

Their menu is extensive.  They have savoury crepes but of course, the menu is dominated with chocolate desserts & drinks.  Ordered:The Antillaise crepe ($13.95): grilled bananas & pineapples with two scoops of ice cream with chocolate sauce drizzled all over it.  It's one of their flaming crepes (yes - flaming!).  So it was flamed with rum.  So I was expecting a fiery of FLAMES but alas it was only meek blue ones that can only be seen in my photo if you zoom in. Oh well, the flame itself was great!  Grilled pineapples and chocolate - hello and welcome to my belly!Araguni, chocolate to drink ($9.75): this is off their dark vintages menu.  It was thick, warm and just slightly sweet.  Hot chocolate from other places just seem like a farce now, though much better for your wallet. For $9.75, I thought this was a bit pricey. Another one of those places that I wish I had in my home town.  Sigh."

It still occasionally enters conversation and we reminisce about the desserts and chocolate milkshakes we had. I was excited to return when I came back to Montreal for a visit today, and was not disappointed. I had the raspberry chocolate mousse, and it was perfect. This places knows chocolate and keeps it very classy. A great place to impress your sweet tooth friend or upscale relatives. Also, lovely patio."

The portion was enormous, with grilled chicken, oranges, grapefruit and a fun crepe-based wheel of sorts on the top.  So fun and filling. But not to worry, I saved room for dessert (and wasn't disappointed)!!  The fleur de sel brownie was amazing.  Served warm with a caramel sauce drizzled over it, there was the perfect balance of salty and sweet.   Luckily, it was a normal sized brownie because otherwise I would have been in trouble (and eaten far too much).  The service was great, our waitress was so nice and the food came very quickly (and the water was poured often which is so nice).  Plus, she let us sit and talk for a long time with no fuss.  Truly a wonderful (chocolately) experience."

This place is awesome!I've been here a few times and I've fallen in love. Juliette & Chocolat has a very clean, bright, cozy and chic décor. The place is big and can seat many people which I like about the place. The staff is very friendly, but most of my visits here I was suffering through the service.This restaurant offers uniquely flavoured chocolates from different countries with great quality. You have the option of having your chocolate grandma style, classic, milk, white and dark with any order that has chocolate. They also have chocolate cocktails which I absolutely loved! I had their choco-mojito and snow white (see picture). My choco-mojito consisted of chilled dark chocolate with a splash of cream mint liquor topped off with whipped cream and crushed mint candy on top in a martini glass. My snow white drink had chilled white chocolate with baileys with foam and a dust of cinnamon, also in a martini glass. Other great chocolate or tooth decay options they have are a variety of crepes that come with either fruits, chocolate, ice ream, caramel, maple syrup and more; pastries, fondues, brownies, chocolate shots, variety of ice-cream etc. Everything is made with love and the presentation of the food is very nice too. What I love about the chocolate at Juliette & Chocolat is that their chocolate is not overly sweet to the point where it gets nauseating, it's just chocolaty in a very pleasant way.Although this place is big for their chocolate, there are non-chocolate options too that I had the pleasure to enjoy. Their savoury meal options were my favourite! I love their pesto complete- buckwheat crepe stuffed with your choice of ham or turkey, your choice of pesto and egg with a side salad. Their chicken spinach with goat cheese was very good too- buckwheat crepe topped with spinach, good amount of warm goat cheese and tender strips of chicken with a side salad. Furthermore, I also had their Mexican salad which was uniquely delicious- mozzarella cheese with juicy chicken on mixed greens, served with crispy buckwheat chips and pineapple salsa.The protions are great and food was consistent, fresh and delish each time. The prices are reasonable for what you receive. It may seem a bit pricey, but you're paying for the quality. Overall, Juliette & Chocolat is an amazing restuarant! Expect everything except great service-service is very slow. My advice would be not to come here if you're in a hurry."

DIVINE! Next time, I'll add an ice cream next to the cake and I'll have my new fondant au chocolat to enjoy. Juliette et Chocolat is the place to go when a coma by chocolate is needed the most. They offer various types of chocolate, milk, dark, etc. Their desserts are more rich than sweet. Satisfaction is guaranteed if you are a chocolate lover. This location is better too than the St-Denis one, there's less waiting time and no or almost no lineups to get in. Other interesting info: Fondant au chocolat: most of the time the center isn't melting (upsets me each time).Wine: you need to order a meal (read: dinner/lunch - not dessert) to be able to order their wine, which is very disappointed providing their low price on wine.

It was a cool and quiet Sunday afternoon, and we were seated on the side while all the windows/doors were opened. Nice fresh air and people watching!We ordered few items to satisfy our sweet tooth craving:- Classic style dark semi-sweet hot chocolate ($4.99)- The Velvety Chill ~ chilled milk chocolate, Baileys, scoop of hazelnut ice cream, and a dash of fleur de sel caramel ($10.50)- regular coffee- Gianduja and lime mousse cake ($5.99)We loved the iced chocolate Baileys drink the most.  It's very smooth and not overly sweet.  Seriously, Baileys makes everything taste so much better!!! LOLHot chocolate was presented in a weird bowl and milk jug.  Initially we didn't know what to do with the bowl.  It tasted pretty good.Coffee was A-okay, nothing to write about.Mousse cake was meh. I have had much better cake elsewhere. The cake bottom could be more interesting if it was made crunchier.Service was pretty good. Many Yelpers have complained that the service was cold. I guess we were lucky on that day. It wasn't exceptionally warm, but it was attentive enough. Just a bit slow, but that's what I found in many Montreal eateries. Is it because Montreal people are more laid back? :PThey do have some cute chocolate items for sale in their fridge. Heard of Chocolate Lipsticks before? :D They looked very real indeed!This place is definitely on the expensive side. Would I be back? May be.

I can't blame it on the waitresses which were super nice but maybe they are trying to run the business with too few people. It took them 20 minutes to pour water on our glasses and another ten to take our orders. This is a small café. I ordered a fruit fondue which was ok, I have high standards for chocolate and this one was not great but not awful either. Fruit was fresh and the selection very appropriate for a chocolate fondue.

/user_details?userid=NUJsFBSaa6RfHETL-ybBCA,Camille L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Juliette et Chocolat has good chocolate, which is expected from a chocolate restaurant, it's not cheap but hey it is good quality so I won't complain (it's not overpriced either). Their savoury dishes are not impressive though...bland salad and half empty, kinda dry crepes - still, not too bad.The reason I am writing this review today, and why I am only giving two stars instead of three or four, is because their service is awful. I live right next to Juliette et Chocolat and my roommate is a chocoholic, so I come here about twice a month - almost a regular. Today it took us 40 minutes to get our dessert and coffee, and the waitress avoided eye contact the whole time and did not apologize a single time (oh and she also messed up my friend's order), and again made us wait another 15 for the check ( that we had already asked for). At 9 PM the restaurant is super packed, I totally get that you are running around like crazy, but at least let us know you are sorry for the waiting time.The problem is this is far from being the first time it happens. The service is always slow, even if you go for brunch, but this year the restaurant has been obviously understaffed during dessert time (8 to 11 PM), making waiting times ridiculously long. Also their staff is very unprofessional. They need to remedy to this because it's really affecting their dining quality. Also, Cacao 70 on Parc has great service and just as good chocolate, so it's time to get off your high horse Juliette."

So while it would be a great date spot *in theory*, something gets lost in translation by the time you get a table and finally get served.I wouldn't do it on a first date, but it might be a fun place to end a night with someone you know well, especially after dinner."

That was exactly what I said when I drag our group into this cute little chocolate store on the corner of the street. We were greeted in french and a sweet chocolate scent. There is a huge glass counter by their entrance that holds various kinds of chocolate truffles, treats, cookies, etc. There are so many different choices, but I was close to making a decision, until I saw more glass counters in the back of the store, with cakes, mousse, pies, and more!! I went to the back of the stores and there were different brownie, cake, pies, tiramisu, cakes, mousse, pies, did I say cakes? It doesn't matter how many circles I walked in front of these lovely sweet treats, or how many hands prints and nose prints I left on their glass case, I finally decided on 4 things, all for myself, of course. Bf can get his own.their tiramisu is comfortably nested in a cute little glass jar, it's so cute that I didn't want to open it. Ok, I'll save it for later.the chocolate mousse is the shape of half a dome, and covered with a layer of chocolate. I dug a fork into it and it collapsed because its center is filled with super moist cake, creamy chocolate mousse and a layer of hazelnut cream. I took a bite, then another bite, then another. Bf can keep staring at me, like I said earlier, he can get his own.Of course I bought a piece of nutella brownie, how can you say no to nutella brownie?? and a piece of pistachio hazelnut brownie, because it's right next to the nutella one and you can just one by and not the other. It's not polite to make any one of them feel left out. These are not your regular store brownie. There are super moist, rich, but not overly rich to make you feel disgusting, they are just right, and extremely satisfying. Of course there's no sharing.There's also cheesecake brownie. Who came up with that idea? cheesecake + brownie!

There were 3 of us and we each wanted to order a drink and split 2 crepes. But we were told that you have to order a crepe with each alcoholic drink. I don't believe the same rule applies to non-alcoholic chocolate drinks. So we ended up splitting 2 drinks and 2 crepes amongst the 3 of us.The choco-mojito and Irish chocolate drinks were good. The choco-mojito was kinda thick though. The Irish chocolate is chocolate milk with whiskey (served warm).Their crepes are made from buckwheat; they were thin and light. We ordered a turkey pesto crepe which was delicious. We also ordered a dark chocolate/banana/strawberry crepe. They were out of strawberry so they substituted blackberries instead. The dark chocolate was really good, not too sweet. As others noted, this place is on the pricier side. Most drinks (even non-alcoholic) are above $6 dollars.

/user_details?userid=JnFgOEhZlEULr03mnJjFKA,Julie C.,"Albany, NY",3 star rating,"I love chocolate, and I seek out chocolate throughout the world when I travel. Upon visiting its website and reading reviews, it was clear that Juliette and Chocolat is less artisanal and more dessert-chain-esque. I was curious about this place but didn't prioritize it among my other chocolate stops in Montreal. On my last evening of a 4.5 day trip to the city, I decided to give it a go. The desserts were predictable but delicious. I order the fruit fondue with the s'mores bowl (the restaurant charged extra for the bowl even though the bowl is in the fondue's description!). The chocolate in the s'mores bowl was way, way, way too sweet. We probably only used a forth or a third of what was in the bowl for dipping. My partner ordered a crepe with bananas, hazelnuts, meringue, and 55% dark chocolate. We opted for the 55% because - and I know this from plenty of experience - that a chocolatier who doesn't know how to do 70% cocoa either has a bitter product or a produce dosed in too much vanilla. I have no idea what the 70% tastes like at Juliette, but the 55% was, again, extremely sweet. It was too sweet for my taste. We were also hopping for a dollop of meringue. Juliette provides a bowl of hard (freeze-dried?) meringue bits. We were not impressed with these. Still, Juliette is a fun place for dessert. Just don't go in expecting artisan chocolate."

The spontaenous choice of the birthday-girl was a chocolate restaurant, and as we were close by, we stopped in at this J&C. With no reservation, the friendly waiter accommodated our entire group, effortlessly switching into English with them. As I myself do not have much of a sweet tooth, I just had tea, but my students tried various things from the menu, and all seemed very happy with their choices. We didn't have to wait long for our meals to be delivered. A surprise mini-cake with candle and singing was brought at the right moment to the birthday-girl, and everyone left happy. There was a small mix-up with one of the bills, but this is the nature of dining in huge groups and overall I was really happy."

My friend recommended me to this place and just looking at it from the outside it gave a sense of a great quaint ambiance. Their variations of chocolate were huge. We tried the Fleur de Sel Brownie since my friend recommended it. It's basically a chunky warm chocolatey packed brownie with a salted caramel drizzled over it. It sounds overbearingly sweet right? fortunately the salted caramel was slightly salty to the point that it made the combination amazing.We also tried the fruit salad crepe which tasted devine as well. There were large amounts of fresh food and paired perfectly with drizzled white chocolate over the warm crepe. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake was unique too. The pie crust had a distinct taste with a slight hint of salt which really pulled the cake together. Also tried the dark hot chocolate with nutella and a dark hot chocolate with vanilla ice cream. These would have been SUPER amazing on their own. But in my opinion, with our desserts it was too much chocolate overall.  Get these on their own. It's best to order regular milk with all the deserts so it can somewhat clean the palate from all the sugar but at the same time compliment the chocolate super well."

I ordered the Guanaja, the Araguani, and the Tanzania. ""Grandma's Style"" is the best, uber chocolately.They're served with a small piece of chocolate too, treat after treat. (The least they can do to make up for the poor service.) If you like Milkshakes, and are hungry, these will fill you right up with creamy goodness. Its not like Fat Burger's milkshakes, but a bit more chocolatelyish, its a rich shake.As far as their crepes, they're okay, not so flavorful, kinda flimsy, that pesto goat cheese with walnuts. Eh, wouldn't come back here for that alone.  The prices aren't too high, but they aren't too low. Medium priced, for what I order its about $12 per cup. I was full after drinking my hot chocolate. I felt like I overdosed on chocolate. To be completely honest, I felt sick, but its the kind where, its so good during the process...looking at the cup of chocolate, thinking, dang, I'm drinking a ton of calories and fat, and having a great time doing it. These drinks have nice consistency to them, they go down nice. The dark chocolate drinks are SO strong, but SO flavorful. Its like magic going down the tube. I love a good cup of fancy hot chocolate.If this place weren't in Montreal, I'd be a regular, butttt the next time I find myself in that area, I'd surely return."

/user_details?userid=t1ToOy7-4yumhNrY3K5GFA,Rebecca H.,"North Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Where should I start? Maybe with the Chocolate chaud a la Grandmere which is so thick that it leaves a trail akin to that of lava. Or perhaps with the Fleur du Sel Brownies that contrast the tang and bite of sea salt with the richness of caramel and the complexity of dark chocolate.  Or maybe I should focus on the savories.  The buckwheat crepes filled with layers of spinach and Gruyere or served au complete. The salad with their twirling garnishes and chocolate inspired dressings.  Whatever you get, it will be amazing; that's why I've embarked on a mission to order every single article on the menu.  The new location is very convenient located on St. Laurent Boulevard, close to the hustle of downtown and the urban hip Plateau.  During the evening, you may have to wait over an hour to get a table; however, if you go during the day, you're likely to be seated immediately.  The service is decent, but not spectacular.  The waitress sometimes disappears and doesn't return for long lengths of time.  In order to place order, get waiter, or request the bill, you'll often have to hail someone down. However, what Juliette et Chocolate lacks in service it certainly makes up for in the menu.  They serve a variety of hot chocolates, savory buckwheat crepes and salads, sweet crepes, ice cream sundaes, brownies, and other pastries.  Last time I was there, we ordered buckwheat crepes and split a bottle of cidre brut.  The buckwheat crepes are light yet hearty, perfectly complemented by a green side salad.  Prior to that occasion, I've also had a dark chocolate-banana crepe, chocolate molten cake, more buckwheat crepes, a crepe flambé, an original brownie, an ""intense"" brownie, a fleur du sel brownie, and a dark hot chocolate ""a la Grandmere"".  All were delicious, decadent, and very rich.  Overall, I love Juliette et Chocolate.  The service is slightly frustrating, but the overall experience is amazing.  For the best value, get a brownie.  They're decently cheap (not more than you'd pay in a coffee shop), beautifully presented, and wonderfully good."

Immediately, the space is quite lovely. With brick walls, nice lighting, and some touches of white embellishments on the high ceilings, the atmosphere was very pleasing. Not to mention the display cases of assorted chocolates! Now those were enticing...We began with a shared decadent, chocolate-based beverage with an alcoholic touch of creme de menthe, served chilled in a martini glass with a dollop of peppermint-laced whipped cream. Following this delightful bevvy, we decided on sharing a crepe avec poivre, fromage de chevre, et de miel with a side of mixed greens. Once it arrived, in a very timely manner, we consumed what lay on the plate. The crepe was served at the perfect temperature for the fromage de chevre to be all melty, allowing us to spread the cheese around the crepe. Mmmm, yum! After that, we decided to try another crepe which we were also first interested in, with balsamic reduction, fromage de chevre, and roasted tomatoes. This second crepe was gone as quickly as the first! Delectable indeed.What a fantastic (first) experience at this gem of a chocolate restaurant!

You might get it and think 'gee, that's pretty small,' but looks are deceiving. I'm always full after eating it--its rich but delicious! You can't go wrong either with any of the brownies. The 'fleur de sel' is particularly good (it is Quebec after all!) and pair it with a scoop of ice cream and you've got the perfect treat! If you go, you simply must have a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is not the powered crap you buy from a grocery store--or even a coffee shop, these days--but rather legitimate chocolate melted down and mixed with hot milk. They also offer some savoury crepes and while I've personally never ordered one everyone who has tells me they're also very good. If you don't have a lot of time--but want to experience the Juliette experience--they offer all of their brownies to go and you can simply order with the hostess at the stand with the till/cash register. Go! You won't regret it!"

We were a group of 15, but instead of being seated right away, they were debating whether to let us in or not. Finally, after waiting outside in the cold, they decided to split us up into smaller tables. Then, to our disappointment, they gave us a reduced menu, even though we saw a couple sitting next to our menu getting the full menu. I ordered a regular dark hot chocolate. It was not bad, but my expectations were a lot higher for the price I was paying. Overall, poor service, slightly pricey, and ""meh"" quality."

Despite the 'classic style' being more creamy/milky than the 'grandma's style,' it was pretty syrupy and chocolaty. Sweet, creamy, chocolaty... hold me.My boyfriend had the white chocolate crepe and liked it a lot. He said it was a little more white chocolate than he would have liked, purely because white chocolate is so sweet, but that yeah, he would go back and have more crepes.Minus one star because the staff weren't overly friendly.

We were seated immediately and served water but no one came to check on us after that.We were right there at the wait station. No one looked our way. We had to ask for a server. We left after 25 minutes. We had reservations across the street at Maestro SVP. They know how to treat customers. We actually came back because this place had been highly recommended.This time we were seated and taking care of after we had told the hostess of our experience earlier - so the server came within a couple of minutes. We ordered the chai tea. It was excessively sweet and lacked chai.We also had a decaf cappuccino. They charge an extra $.60 for decaf.We also ordered a mint chocolate herbal tea. There was nothing special about it.Then we ordered the grandma's hot chocolate. We requested whipped cream on top of it. We were told they did not have whipped cream.  We all thought that was odd.The table in front of us had three Sundaes. They all had huge toppings of whipped cream.Our bill was 19.60Overrated and overpriced. If you want good hot chocolate go to Suite 88. They were very friendly and they even brought us four pieces of domed chocolate. Complimentary.

We were seated and given menus plus water. then we waited.I do believe we were seated in a no man's land of service. a vortex that made us invisible to the waiters hurrying by us to take orders from patrons who just sat down. Or...or maybe the waiter that was assigned our table, and our table only because everyone around us was being served, had thrown his red hat on the ground and quit his job to finally become the street artist he always wanted to be?We had time to wonder because from the time we walked in, to the time we left without being served, it had been around half an hour.  And yes I know, I could have complained about the service to the floor manager, if I had found them, or just pin a waiter down and forced them to take my order but the chocolate craving had dissapeared at  that point, we just ended up at the irish pub across the street, sipping beers and munching angrily on nachos."

/user_details?userid=nMnweiOkKCSAqvc8os7JwA,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"My first two experiences here have warranted a 5-star review, but my last visit brought down my rating to a 3.The good:The food is really good; I love chocolate and this is the perfect place for dessert or a date. Everything I've had here has been really delicious and they have cool combinations.The bad:The service is unbelievably slow, and they are understaffed when it comes to busy nights. The St Laurent location is REALLY loud and even more understaffed than the one on St Denis. But the real disappointment was coming here after dinner and hoping for a drink (most are above $9 and made of rich chocolate with a bit of alcohol). We were told (after waiting 20minutes for our waitress and taking all of that time to decide) that their liquor license only allowed alcohol to be served if the person that was ordering it got a ""meal"" - salad, sandwich, or crepe. I'm sorry - it is 11pm on a Friday and we're coming for dessert - why would I want to order a $10 chocolate and Bailey's with a SALAD? We were very disappointed that this rule was not mentioned anywhere on the menu or on signs and that we had never had a problem with this before during our previous visits. We were told only upon ordering by our (rude) waitress and had to pick something else on the spot.Basically, if you have this type of liquor license (which is ludicrous for this type of place) then notify your customers or else they will leave feeling sour, which no one should do after having dessert!"

There are lots of yummy things on the menu....such as the chocolate cake with a molten center covered in salty caramel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side...have I said I love this place yet?

/user_details?userid=IDDkHmOPQywMS5wJQolANA,Carol C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My husband and I went for dessert with another couple. I ordered my usual favorite fleur de sel brownie and my husband was feeling adventurous and ordered the red velvet cheesecake brownie. We were told that this was an off-menu item especially made for Valentine's Day so we were curious to try it since we are usually fond of red velvet dessert. What a big mistake! Not only did it not taste like red velvet anything, it was stale and hard! There was a clear difference in freshness between what the rest of us had ordered and this. My husband and I are not at all picky and we had never sent food back before but this was just not edible. Our friends even tasted it and agreed. Seeing that Valentine's Day was three days ago, we politely asked the waitress if this brownie was also three days old because it tasted as such. She proceeded to get her assistant manager (who by the way, had her paperwork spread out all over the table not far from us, it was like her own personal office). The assistant manager then asked us what the problem was and so my husband explained once again, very politely, that this not fresh and tasted horrible. By the look on her face you would have thought that this was her own personal recipe and she had baked it herself. She was clearly offended and kept insisting that she was very shocked because a lot of other customers had ordered it and loved it. We tried to explain to her that it just was not edible and asked her if we could change it for something else. After a lot of going back and forth, she finally offered to bring my husband another piece. We didn't see how that would help since this ""new"" piece would probably be from the same old batch but at this point we were so tired of arguing with her that we just agreed. Of course, the second piece tasted just as horrible as the first so my husband just left it there. What we don't understand is if you are going to give us a new piece anyway, why not give us something else that we would actually enjoy? It was as if she was purposely trying to get rid of this old batch of brownies. The worst is after all this, she retrieved back to her little office a few feet away from us to do her paperwork and never even bothered coming back to check up on us and see if this second piece was an improvement from the last one. Customer service was a big zero."
