Definitely a low key place, with small menu. Food was MSG free (I can otherwise always tell after meal). Chef also poked her head out to see how dining room was doing and we took the opportunity to thank her. AMAZING place and we'll definitely return when back in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=JfosrR1-vL6nbeMLojBwpg,Rob G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,I was in Montreal with my wife. We stopped by OMMA for some Korean food. We walked in and was greeted by the owners daughter. She was polite and told us her mother is the cook. The place was clean and seats were comfortable. I ordered marinated beef and my wife ordered kimchee soup. I have been to Korea many times and my wife is Korean and I can truly say that this was the most tasty and authentic Korean I have had. Super delicious!

However, they are quite far from authentic Korean food. Their yukgyejqng was something I've never seen in my life - and I'm Korean. Their kimchi was also very foreign to me. I don't mind fusion Korean food, but this place calls itself just Korean not fusion. It's not a bad place to have a meal, but just be aware that it's not really authentic Korean."

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As much as I love Korean food, this place unfortunately did not impress me as much.Their atmosphere is nice and service is attentive, but that's about it. They didn't have complimentary banchan like most Korean restaurant, in fact, they charge you for a small plate of kimchi which I find it bit odd. Their selection is not as big and some of the dishes are not really Korean. Although the food is good, I personally find it overpriced. There are definitely other restaurants where you can get better food for less."
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was initially intrigued by this place after walking by it while going home a few days ago, so today, craving some Korean food, I suggested we check this place out. The inside was cute; paper lanterns, quiet jazz music, and orange ambient lighting made for a soft and relaxing atmosphere. I'd say that the restaurant can seat maybe 20 people max. It looked like there were two or three people behind the counter in the kitchen. The waiter was kind, and the service was pretty fast, but there was only one other group in the restaurant when we came. There's a bar that looks like it serves some sort of alcohol, probably beer, but we didn't sit there.After frequenting (or at least trying) most of the popular places around the downtown area, I wasn't sure what taste I was expecting from this place - maybe something authentic, traditional? However, this wasn't the case. Though the taste was new for sure, the side dishes weren't traditional; in fact, there was only one dish of cabbage - no potatoes, which I basically live for. Still, it wasn't bad, even though it wasn't kimchi, since I'm a fan of sweet things. The sauce was reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. As for the main dishes we ordered, the bulgogi wasn't the best I've had - it was too cooked and a bit burnt at the bottom. The bibimbap was better than average, but it felt like it didn't have much beef. In general, though I left Omma feeling comfortably full, I don't feel like the portions or quality of the dishes were worth the price. Though I put $$, it's more on the pricier side of $$, closer to $$$. Not as an insult, but I probably won't be back - there are many other choices in this area that I'd prefer."

/user_details?userid=XvNcoc1FwQKGFOJdXE2eJA,Eileen C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Omma god the new location is better than the original one. Make sure to come early enough, it's small and fills up fast. We had the sweet potato noodles (definitely recommend), the spicy beef soup, and the red curry. What really makes this place is the intimate environment and cute decor. Great place for a date!"
