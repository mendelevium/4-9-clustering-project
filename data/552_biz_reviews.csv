/user_details?userid=LCZgiPzUKzigGdj76cygQA,Roberta D.,"Weymouth, MA",5 star rating,"AMAZING! My boyfriend and I went to Ile Flottante for our Thanksgiving dinner this year. I made the reservation ahead of time over open table and had to confirm a few days before arriving to the area. When we arrived to the restaurant they had cute name placards set up for all of the premade reservations. We were greeted by the friendly wait staff and seated. The space was wonderful - all black walls from ceiling to the floor, with black tables. This helped to ensure that guests attention was paid to the most important part of the experience - the food. We opeted for the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was absolutely spectacular. The wines paired nicely with the menu. The menu was mostly vegetarian. There was a few meat items - smoked trout in the first meal and duck in the 4th dish. Overall, the dishes were super flavorful. The wait staff was friendly and nice. Absolutely would recommend to anyone looking to have a high end meal in the Montreal area!"
/user_details?userid=_g6P8H3-qfbz1FxbffS68g,Shari A.,"Livingston, NJ",5 star rating,"Superb. This neighborhood place is a total gem.... the most sophisticated food served in a rustic sort of minimalist chic atmosphere with service that is simply perfect. We ventured here based on our research of the foodie sites for Montreal and they were spot on. The beauty of the tasting options is that each person can select a different number of courses so for example, I had a 3 course menu that dovetailed nicely with my husband's 5  courses and I was able to taste his dishes. They also permitted us to do one wine pairing and they split each pour between two glasses which is just so nice for people like us who really enjoy pairings but cannot consume so much wine in one sitting. They prepare daily cocktail specials which are recited by the servers and our choices were sublime. Herbaceous, gorgeous, and they went down so easy! You can really tell that the entire staff is a family affair with each person helping the other out and the dishes are described and delivered on point by a different person for each course. Somehow it doesn't feel disjointed but rather completely in sync. The female owner is the front of the house and the male owner is in the kitchen. He also does all of his own desserts.The menu highlights vegetables like I've never seen done. This makes it perfect for any type of eater. We had one fish dish which was lovely, but the vegetable are the real stars here. The presentation is also art on a plate. The tasting comes with dessert and even after all of that, they are able to convince you to order the signature ile flottante which is changed up often with the chefs own twist. Outstanding. I can't wait to come back the next time we are in town. It's a bummer we are 5 hours away or I would be a regular here! Don't miss this superstar."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For me, this is hands down the best restaurant in Montreal. Creative, varied dishes in a professional and cozy environment make up for the best dinners. I love going back here to discover their seasonal menu and be impressed all over again. I've never been disappointed. The price is also quite reasonable, especially for the quality of dishes delivered. I love the 'let us surprise you' formula. They also adapt the dishes for vegetarians so nicely that I've been thinking of asking for the vegetarian menu a few times, since the plates presented were so great too! I recommend trying this, 100%."

We took the 5 courses dinner. Only one meat course. All of which are on the light side so you might be left (very) hungry at the end of the night."
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A true gastronomic experience! My husband and I each partook in the 7 course tasting menu, and we were wowed by the nuanced flavours and inventive dishes. Each dish is a surprise, as nothing is posted on the menu. It adds to the charm and mystique. The restaurant is located almost adjacent to the famous St Viateur bagel shop, and it's in a historic stretch of the city. It's an apt spot for them, as they are a stronghold in the food making business, along with their famous neighbors. All dishes are immaculately presented and visually stunning, and the staff do a great job of explaining each dish. Come here to be pampered by a tantalizing array of savory dishes. We had an amuse bouche, eggplant terrine, endive salad, lentil dish, walleye fish, maple syrup dessert (quite outstanding!), French toast and the Île Flottante dessert."

Overcooked fish, dry chicken, no red meat, underwhelming flavours in all. There were no real standout dishes and some I couldn't even finish. The menu specifies to say if you have food intollerences, but they made no changes at all. The hostess was very rude, though the waiter who was serving was really nice and did try.Drinks were good, but had to go eat somewhere else after."

I like the fact they have a tasting menu and everything is a surprise, although it may not be for everyone. Their mushroom gnocchi is to die for, if you a big fan of mushroom you'll be happy to have that on your plate. Each plate is nicely presented and pretty to look at. It's a good place to check out if you're in the neighborhood."
/user_details?userid=bgjxd6pnVb_r7SB2RE5_ZA,Kate G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This is the best restaurant I've ever been to.  Here is the part where I say ""and let me tell you, I've been to restaurants before, I don't just eat Doritos and convenience store ham sandwiches every day,"" but seriously though I've been to some restaurants before, haha.  You know like for example, we ate at Liverpool House the night before Ile Flottante (which seems to be a pretty well known joint in the city), and it didn't even come close.The food here is beautifully presented, and has inventive flavors and textures, yet somehow, is also comforting - I can't call it ""comfort food"" because it was also really sophisticated but it felt like a hug for your mouth at the same time.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the dishes and the wines, and she was friendly and helpful but not overbearing, basically she was the perfect server and it seemed like that was the case for the entire staff.  We got the 5 course meal with wine pairing, if you don't drink alcohol obviously skip the wine pairing but GET IT otherwise, even if you think you don't like wine that much.  Each dish was complimented perfectly by the wine, and we got to taste wines we never would have found otherwise - some were effervescent, some earthy, one was a little bit funky, but each was delicious.  Even dessert came with a mini cocktail - when you tasted the dessert by itself it was lovely, but then a sip of the cocktail alongside made your mouth explode (in a good way).  My description falls short, just go there, it's a really special place."
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",5 star rating,"A lot of really nice touches plus some amazing vegetable forward food.  The wine pairings are definitely worth it and I would totally do that again.  WE did the 5 courses and they offer a number of variations on the number of courses even within the table, which is interesting and different than other places we've been.  But a nice way to customize and work with your customers depending on how they are feeling each day.  Service was excellent but relaxed.  Seemed like the staff was enjoying sharing things with you rather than a stiff service, which was nice and make for an enjoyable evening."

Of 7 dishes, I would struggle to recall any. I do give them credit for being vegetable forward and not relying on meat to carry a menu."
/user_details?userid=6lELxb5duHs0u9C0oNkXtw,Farah S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Delightful experience. Incredible food with fresh ingredients and absolutely beautiful presentation. The menu is heavy on vegetables indeed but then it is so well done that it even elates a carnivore. Great wines and excellent service. This definitely is one of those restos us Montrealers should be proud of .
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the restaurant Les Deux Singe de Montarvie with a different name and a different decor. No more pictures of monkeys on the walls lol. The owner, chef and staff are all the same. The first time I went to Les Deux Singes was a few years ago and it blew my mind. The second time I went I was less impressed because the menu was Asian fusion and I didn't like that. Nonetheless I was excited to come back and try this restaurant under a different name. It definitely lived up if not surpassed my expectations!I got the Warsaw cocktail which was so good! It contained vodka, calvados, apple juice, rosemary syrup, lemon juice and bitters. I was worried that the rosemary taste would overpower everything else but it wasn't the case. It was strong but also a bit sweet but not too sweet. It was perfect. Basically there's no food menu and you have to choose either the three, five or seven course tasting menu. We chose three because choosing the five course meant getting two extra veggie courses which did not appeal to me whatsoever. Plus $45 for a three course meal is a steal! It's like going to a fancy resto during mtl a table! Before the first course we got an amuse bouche. Basically it was a slice of beet (aka beet carpaccio)  with marscapone on top and caramelized hazelnuts. It was so delicious! I only eat beets because it's healthy but if beets were always cooked this way I probably would eat a whole lot more of it!! Plus I love when I get extra stuff besides what is written on the menu.  Next came the duck ravioli with foie gras sauce and a mushroom tapenade. I think there might have been some spinach in there as well. This was my favorite dish of the night. The pasta was so fresh and the sauce was so rich. My boyfriend's favorite was the next course which  was the veal with blue cheese on top and grilled veggies. The veal was actually pretty thick and it melted in your mouth. I personally love blue cheese but for those of you who don't, don't worry it doesn't have a very strong blue cheese taste. The veal was amazing! The grilled veggies however did nothing for me. Lastly my boyfriend ordered the île flottante dessert which was $8 extra. It was like a fancy banana split but the bananas were sliced up and they were at the bottom of the plate with ice cream, pomegranate and a caramel coulis on top. This was definitely the better of the two desserts. I had the dessert that came with tasting menu. It was a slice of pineapple with pineapple sorbet and dark chocolate ganache. It was very pretty to look at. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. It was a bit too much pineapple overload for me. Considering everything before it was outstanding I expected the same from my dessert even though I'm not really a dessert person to begin with.  That being said I would definitely come back. It's such a cute little restaurant and the food is delicious and pretty affordable! The menu changes every 2-3 months. Go if you haven't already!!"
/user_details?userid=KRc6f0VF2BAF_6QYcp2GIQ,Victor M.,"Warsaw, Poland",5 star rating,"They just opened friday the 27th of October, the place expanded having acquired the lease to the neighboring space. It's quaint and calm. You neither feel stuffed nor do you feel too exposed, the seating arrangement is spacious and even when full the restaurant doesn't feel busy. I opted for the 5 course set menu (you had the choice of 3 for 45$, 5 for 68$ and 7 for 85$). The meals were a combination of fresh market ingredients of whatever is in season. There was a dish of duck ravioli, braised pork, spigarello, mushrooms and a delicious squash seaweed. I have attached some pictures of the new restaurant and menu. (Which, according to the server will change every 6-9 weeks or so)I highly recommend you try it. Ps. Try the warsaw cocktail it's strong and surprisingly good (12$)"

We could choose between 3, 5 or 7 course meal, but there was not an option for an a la cart menu.All 6 of us tried the 5 course meal. Food was pretty good. The veal was tender and juicy but the sauce was disappointing. The duck ravioli could have been perfect except it was too salty. Vegetarian dishes, surprisingly, stole the show - Dessert dish, mushroom dish, and beet dish were absolutely wonderful. 4/5 stars. Next time I would opt for 3 course meal and stick with vegetarian options.Atmosphere: casual and unpretentious. Dark modern feel.Overall, good."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Went here with very high expectations. Didn't come out amazed. We were two people and had the 3 course menu with an extra 5$ to try  the scallops dish. The amuses bouche was a carrot cake. Good taste and the crème fraîche was good but this was more of a sweet dish and would have preferred something salty to begin with. The king oyster mushroom was my favourite dish. So tasty but not enough!! The scallop dish was ok. Nothing special. And I am a huge scallop loverThe duck was very good. The figs made the dish special but again portions were too small. The desert was an almond cake with ice cream and meringue. Nice but nothing to write home about. All in all I was happy with the visit  but the portions were too small for the price. I wouldn't go back.
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My recent visit to this small restaurant in Mile  End had me quickly convinced why it's been ranked as the top restaurant in Montreal! The upscale bistro is small (although they will be expanding next door soon) with an open kitchen in the back where you can see the micro greens and edible flowers on display used in the plate presentation. The space is quaint with a romantic feel thanks to the low lighting, dark tables and pretty wall art. This restaurant serves a refined tasting menu of eclectic dishes that are as beautifully presented as they are flavourful; the layering of fresh ingredients and textures was incredible to say the least! The menu changes seasonally and so I am already looking forward to my next visit to see what surprises the young but ultra talented chef has in store. There is no a la carte option, only three menus to choose from: regular, pescatarian and vegetarian ranging from 65$ to 55$, respectively; a steal considering you get 4 courses plus an amuse-bouche of that caliber. The wine pairing was perfection at an affordable 30$. We had the regular menu which included scallops, red cabbage purée, lardon, cauliflower mousse; quinoa with nuts and citrus salad; the amuse-bouche of broccoli mousse, sesame ash and charred broccoli and shishito peppers, verde and caviar; the cassoulet main; and a dessert of lemon coconut churros. As if that was not enough, the incredibly generous and attentive staff made for a perfect evening!"

I walked on St -Viateur so many times and never noticed the restaurant until my friend proposed to go there for dinner.Yelp reviews are great and it is definitely accurate. We went for the tasting menu for $60 each ~ you can also choose a vegetarian  version.  We took both and shared. Let me tell you that the planting is beautiful and the taste of each dish is simply delicious!  The portions are not big but at the end of the meal I didn't feel hungry anymore...it was just right! The restaurant is not big but you don't feel crowded at all. ..it is quite cozy and intimate. If you are looking for a romantic restaurant and amazing food, well this is the place! I also love how they write the name of the person who reserved the table on a big piece of rock and place it on the table :)The name of the restaurant is not mentioned outside so make sure to look for the address."

/user_details?userid=v9qjsYNJFpW9kRMXgUsDbw,Lois L.,"Stonington, CT",5 star rating,"We hesitated before reserving a table at this restaurant because, based on reviews, although admittedly they were great we were concerned that the food would be too precious and not worth the hefty prices. Wine can be expensive in Montreal as well and we could not find a wine list on lineStill, we had enjoyed a great meal there when the restaurant had been named Les Deux Singes and owned by the same people so we decided to roll the dice.Wow!  We opted for the three course meal - no choices to be made here other than the number of courses -- and we were blown away!  First, an amuse bouche was presented  in a large covered bowl on which was posed with a small tart of perfectly cooked and seasoned fresh legumes including fava beans and sweet peas.  We popped that in our mouths and uncovered the dish to find a sublime little cold pea puree  with a quenelle of celery sorbet in the center. From there forward, all three courses contained both familiar and unfamiliar ingredients prepared in unexpected and delicious ways. I am not generally a fan of eggplant but their version was exquisite.  Normally, we pay close attention to food descriptions in the hope of re-creating our favorite dishes, but here it was daunting. I just want to return and trust.Our main course was cod decorated with a variety of edible flowers and sauced to perfection with ingredients some of which I did not recognize but all of which worked  wonderfully together.The dessert was equally stunning involving flavors including spruce, and textures I have never experienced.  I have been to many similarly billed restaurants in New York, Paris and, most recently, Providence Rhode Island, whose menus hold the same promise, but not ones that have delivered so fully as Ile Flottante.  We will be back and this time will challenge ourselves to an extra two courses coupled with the recommended wine pairings. Three courses were sufficient here even though portion sizes were what one would generally expect from a tasting menu, but temptation based on this great experience trumps self-control! There is a third option of 7 courses for those whose appetites allow."

All of the dishes I tried were beautifully plated and the combination of different ingredients created wonderful flavors that would please any palate. It is definately worth trying out. The resto itself is small and perfect for a date night,  special occasions or friends get together. The service was super friendly which created a warm cozy environment . The chef is a true artist and does an excellent job at taking simple ingredients such as broccoli to create wonderful mouth-watering dishes! Will definately go back!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"This cute little restaurant is simply incredible.The food is delicious. We had the duck ravioli with foie gras and scallops ceviche with kiwi as an appetizer. Needless to say the foie gras mousse is so good that we wiped the dish with the warm bread that was brought to our table at the beginning of the dinner. Main course consisted of the famous braised pork belly and catch of the day. Don't miss the pork belly dish, it has an amazing combination of ingredients. The catch of the day was grouper served with tiny baby potatoes and bacon, bacon baby, a fish dish with bacon can't go wrong and this one was outstanding!For dessert I had the caramelized endive with goat cheese and citrus, which for my surprise is listed as an appetizer in the online menu. Appetizer or dessert the endive was great. The other choice was the chocolate mousse with cherries, my favourite! The cocktails in this resto are made with love, spicy caesar with a white pickle and old fashioned with amaretto were certainly perfect choices to kick off the dinner. The small list of wines is carefully selected, it is rare to find sauvignon blanc with so much character as the one we chose to go along  with our food. Last but not least the service is great. As the pause between the different courses was a little bit long the sweet staff brought us single dumpling as amuse-bouche to consume while waiting. I'm coming back for more and next time I'll be sitting at the bar to observe how this magic food is prepared!"

While we left full (with a take home box), we made a point to remember this place for our next visit and recommend it to friends and family. The cocktails were also very delicious.

It's been a while, so I forget the specifics, except that I know that I left feeling like I had to go back again. Given the number of good restaurants in Montreal that I have yet to try, going to the same place twice has high opportunity costs, but I think it will be worth it with this place. Food was unique and delicious. Ambiance was good. Maybe I'm a little too swooned by the fact that it's on St. Viateur (a street that I love)? But I swear, that's part of the whole experience.They change their menu every 3 weeks, so there's lots to try! Looking forward to going back this summer (probably need to make a reservation now to do that - they book up real fast and far in advance!!)"
/user_details?userid=51mKC4xSIfJnpXcHDMbrJw,Joshua J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok, here we go. I hate pricey restaurants. I think they're pompous and pretentious, rarely living up to the hype. Les Deux Singes does not fit that bill. This restaurant blew both myself, a prior restaurant manager, and my girlfriend, one of the best chefs I have ever met, far out of the water.We came in with no expectations, and were pleasantly surprised immediately upon walking in. The atmosphere is intimate, nuanced, and polite; the polar freakin' opposite of La Queue de Cheval (in my opinion, one of the worst restaurants in Montreal). After being directed to our table, with my name chalked in on a plaque, we sat and met our waiter. He had on a pretty sweet pair of glasses and a comforting disposition; extremely unobtrusive and respectful. We already knew what we wanted - the tasting menu - and ordered while discussing wine pairings with the waiter. Instead of upselling the crap out of us, he suggested his favorite - the second least expensive wine on the menu - and described it in excellent detail. The wine came out, matched up beautifully to the description (something that, in my opinion, is very rare), and set a precedent for the meal to follow. The food started coming out from the quiet, aromatic, and wonderfully choreographed open-air kitchen that was literally 10 feet away. Writing a review for this place is tough, as it is exceedingly difficult to accurately describe this food. It is mind-blowing. Both my girlfriend and I are gardeners, and the produce that they brought to the table bumped our standard of what ""fresh"" meant. The techniques were absolutely inspiring (broccoli foam?!). The plates were remarkably balanced. The flavors popped, but didn't compete with one another. The best part? These two seemingly-insatiable patrons were full when we left (score!). I don't know if it was the wine, the non-confrontational environment, watching the co-owners hustle alongside their staff, or the absolute shock I was feeling from the food, but I walked out of there in a trance. Our meal, after tip and with a bottle of wine, came in around $200 and we felt it was worth every. single. penny. If you want the best dining experience in Montreal, go to Les Deux Singes. You'll be happy you did."

Oh-My-God was the food delicious.  I do not believe the same spice, except for salt,  was used twice.   I remembered that I did not alert the restaurant that I did not like beets, and I mentioned it to our waiter, hoping there were none on the menu. And, course, there were. When that course with the beets came out, there were no beets on my plate. My wife loves beets and she loved eating them.

However, the food, service, and experience are totally worth it.My dinner companion and I split two tasting menus (the meat menu and fish menu), with wine flights, cocktails, and tip, for about CAD 130 each.  Each dish was interesting (although with a focus on quality of ingredients and preparation, not ""weirdness""), and good wine accompaniments.  Probably the best was the lamb dish, although really everything was good.  Unlike a lot oftasting menus, each dish was pretty substantial, with more than enough to share a few bites.I'll definitely go back when I'm in Montreal again."

The menu they offer is worth way more than the 65$ they ask for .!!The restaurant it self ... is beautiful very intimate with an open kitchen ( they will be closing the kitchen with glass soon .. so the chef can have kore privacy ) the lamps are made by a local artist ..wooden chairs wooden tables ... and every table has a granite brick with the name of the person who placed the reservation ( very original touch ).They change their menu every 6 to 7 weeks .... to make you ( like me ) go back and try every single menu.!!!For all those reasons and more .... this place deserves nothing less than 5

The atmosphere is almost as funky as the restaurant's name. An X-ray observation lamp with two monkey heads and what appears to be an X-ray film of a hip can be spotted on the wall of this hipster garage restaurant. Very nice touch indeed. We started off with cocktails. I had the amaretto kumquat old fashioned which was amazing! Different from the traditional but worth breaking the rules to explore something more refreshing. Also to mention that our server was very helpful and understanding throughout our entire stay. Every dish was presented like a gem and tasted like heaven. Each element on the plate went so well with each other. If every restaurant offered food as good as Les Deux Singes de Montarvie, the world would be in a better placeIf someone asked me where they should go eat in Montréal - Les Deux Singes de Montarvie would be my answer."

Perfection is not something I find often in a restaurant.The 5 course meal my husband and I had here was one of the most memorable ever, rivaling those we've had at the finest places in NYC that are palaces of fine dining. Think Bernadin and Del Posto in terms of refinement and satisfaction.All dishes were strongly but not exclusively vegetarian. Braised short ribs sneaked into the raviolo and chicken sausage lurked in the braised vegetables. But this restaurant is a vegetable lover's delight. I've never had so many vegetables cooked in so many different ways to such varied results.If we lived in Montreal we'd be monthly customers."

Casual yet comfortable and intimate ambiance.Short menu but packed with flavour. Adequate wine list with many wine by the glass. Amuse bouche, complimentary from the kitchen that changes frequently. What's not to like about this place? My only critique would be that the menu is short ... Almost too short, only 4 options for both starters and entrees. This is fine if you are only two ppl, but as soon as you are a group and want to try different things, the choices are quite limited and you all end up ordering the same thing. Maybe increase the choices by 50%?"

They do like to keep their dishes a surprise and will tell you what a couple of them are beforehand so I will leave it to the rest of the yelpers to describe the dishes.  I was so impressed with the way they ""reimagined"" certain dishes, and I also loved the focus on vegetables !  I understand the menu changes every couple of months also so I will definitely make another stop here the next time I am in Montreal and would recommend it highly.For our dessert they put some candles on to celebrate our anniversary- love restaurants that pay attention to the notes in the reservation also!    We did the five course menu and it was plenty- we felt satisfied on leaving and not overly full.  It was a wonderful experience."

/user_details?userid=68s2zAkdGQxO1EtgvvdUxA,Chris P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A tremendous place.My wife and I went to Les Deux Singes de Montarvie last Saturday for dinner. We were not disappointed. When we arrived, we found our name on a small chalkboard sitting on what was our table. The decor is eclectic--very, very eclectic--but somehow works well. The restaurant has the feel of a small, quirky neighborhood restaurant, even though the food it serves is anything but ordinary neighborhood fare.To start, I ordered a cocktail. I forget exactly what it was called, but it had whiskey (I think), Amaretto, and kumquats. It was fantastic. My wife went straight for the wine, ordering (for both of us) a bottle of rather excellent trebbiano. A note about Les Deux Singes' wine list: It is small, but it appears to be very well curated. Additionally, and especially for those of us who have grown accustomed to New York wine prices, the bottle prices are eminently reasonable.Back to the food. There are only two menu options: nonvegetarian (regular?), and vegetarian. I chose the former, whilst my wife chose the latter. For the amuse bouche, we were brought a fried(?) zucchini blossom stuffed with eggplant and mozzarella. It was fantastic. (It was also substantially larger than any amuse bouche I've had before.Rather than go through each individual menu choice we had, suffice it to say that everything was marvelous. Additionally, service was fantastic.Highly recommended."

I can't praise this place enough if you could give them more than five stars I would.The service was impeccable-  we have special food requirements and they were able to accommodate us while changing the dishes creatively so they still tasted amazing.   Furthermore the wine recommended to us by the sommelier was just perfect.   All in all this is a gem of a restaurant and by the way the price for such a treasure is beyond reasonable.

I still think about it sometimes and get random cravings for it. Usually I'm the kind of the person that can't stop talking during a meal but this was one of the few times where I was too concentrated on how good the food was to say a word. I had the fish of the day as my entrée, I savored every bite and enjoyed the explosion of flavors in my mouth. I also liked the fact that they gave us little appetizers in between courses, it was a very nice touch. I wasn't wowed by the desert which was a panna cotta but that was probably because I was too full from the rest of the meal. I heard their ile flottante was amazing, I can't wait to go back and try it out. If you haven't been yet, don't walk, run!"
/user_details?userid=sKFQH5R6LLOLt1_gTmgaNg,Cherry L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing ambience. The menu offered three/five/seven courses, with vegetarian options available. We've opted for the three course option, and all of them also include an amuse bouche to start. The menus change seasonally, and this time, we were served a beef carpaccio eith french mascarpone, on top of beets with candied yam. The texture and flavor of the dish was all layered perfectly. Next, we had the duck ravioli with foie gras sauce and pesto basil.  Again, perfectly done.  The sauce was very flavorful but not too overwhelming, and the pesto basil added the surprising touch that made the dish extraordinary. For the main course, we had the grilled duck breast with hoisin sauce with sesame seeds and grilled vegetables. The duck was beautifully cooked, and the sauce complemented the dish perfectly. The vegetables tasted excellent eith a smoky taste. Lastly, we had the pineapple three way for dessert. It was a jelly on top, popsicle and chocolate ganache on top of a pineapple slice in the middlr, and a compressed pineapple sauce at the bottom. We liked the popsicle as it tasted very refreshing. Service was excellent as the servers explained each dish as they were served. Water filled frequently, and servers were very attentive.  Overall, we would definitely come again when we visit Montreal."

/user_details?userid=mfZ7Zb4RxQUN4YQDQsRv1A,Rose S.,"Denville, NJ",5 star rating,"I think it was rated number 2 restaurant in Montreal on tripadvisor. We actually went to the number one place (europea) and this place was 100 times better! Getting reservations for a Saturday night was pretty difficult, so we ended up having dinner at 9pm.The restaurant is small in a cozy not cramped kind of way and all the servers were super sweet. They have an open kitchen concept, so you can watch the chefs do their thing. I asked our server why the place is called ""two monkeys of Montarvie?"" I could totally be butchering this story, but he told me that the original owners were doing some kind of  motorcycle race in a village and got lost. Ever since then they were referred to as the two monkeys. The staff thought that maybe the village they got lost in was Montarvie, but apparently such a village does not seem to exist. I was in a semi delirious state when he was telling me this.. this could all be made up?The bread they brought out was warm and very fragrant. I think they sprinkled some cinnamon on it. It came with delicious whipped butter.Since I was still full, I decided to order the duck ravioli in entree (appetizer) size (4pcs)  and try to leave room for dessert. BIG MISTAKE! The raviolis were very, very thin but chewy and OH SO DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. WAHHHH.. I was soooooo very sad that I didn't just order the main portion. I'm crying inside right now =*(My fiance ordered the ""boar belly, braised with beer and soy, accompanied by a parsnip and cauliflower puree, and roasted almonds."" This was also very delicious but not as delicious as my precious ravioli. As much as I wanted to try their desserts, we were both incredibly full and super tired. How much I'd pay.. to have that ravioli again.."

Oh yes and their drinks are great and creative. I recommend their slant on a Caesar.

/user_details?userid=ejiMyon4NMbsYQnfL7im4g,Paul R.,"Media, PA",5 star rating,"Christine and I had one of our best meals ever at Les Deux Singes de Montarvie on Weds. night, our final night in Montreal.  Our table had my name on it, indicating the care that each set of diners receives from an outstanding service staff.  The food, from amuse-bouche to dessert, was excellent -- artfully prepared, creative, beautiful to look at, and, of course, delicious.  I would have liked a bigger piece of sea bass, my main course in the Pescetarian tasting menu, but otherwise the portions were good and I left feeling very content.  Christine had the vegetarian tasting menu, which was outstanding as well.  We didn't opt for the reasonably priced wine flight ($30), but would definitely try it next time.  The wine by the glass selection is small but also reasonably priced and offers a good range of rouge and blanc.  Loved the background music and the whole vibe of the place, which is intimate but never crowded or loud.  It is the type of restaurant you feel good about choosing after scouring all the reviews and one you want to visit again as soon as possible (and once they change the tasting menu, about every 3-4 weeks).Just go and enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=H5DNXAfXva5Fuo1umgAfXw,Diana B.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"We were a little disappointed in this restaurant, especially after all the good reviews. Is it possible that the kitchen is just a little too creative? The service was very good, but we were a little put off by our (male) server's open toed shoes and open shirt. The swordfish was a little over salted and the pasta was just okay. Atmosphere was nice."
/user_details?userid=zLTFhZK0xYB3lc9BwXS56w,Kathleen C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A tiny, personal gem; while the decor is quirky, the cooking sparkles. Some bistro faves you 'd know (bavette), but some surprises like their fabulous house-made lobster sausage. A small but well-chosen and priced wine list. Expert service. The pace is slower because they assume you want to dine, not re-fuel. In response to the person who posted ""his"" star rating system: I *have* brought professional chefs here, and they loved it. ""Cooking from the heart, and a generous one at that"", said one. So I am giving it 5 stars. Only caution is: no air conditioning in summer."
/user_details?userid=siynD6I9oRPOhDajq1I8tg,Mari C.,"Kilmeena, Republic of Ireland",5 star rating,I love this place a lot. It had high end food but the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. Service is always excellent. The dishes are unique and always styled to perfection. Delicious food. Perfect portions. Great timing between each course. I am never disappointed any time I go here. My favourite restaurant in Montreal.

I think this is a must-orderc.  duck ravioli - good but personally I didn't think it was exceptional. The skin of the ravioli could be thinner"

/user_details?userid=XfFowd4YzyWuRfrbtFCTkg,Ming P.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,Not sure why this place gets such a high rating on other sites. We went there because Tripadvisor users rated it as the No. 1 restaurant in Montreal. We were quite shocked when we were presented with the food especially when how all the users rated its outstanding presentation. The presentation was very old school and not that great at all to be honest. It was more like a mess with some dressings dripped on the side. And the taste is very very average at best from the appetizers to the main courses. Any popular Montreal restaurant would beat it for taste for sure. The service is super slow too. Don't go there if you are hungry!!!
/user_details?userid=1MDHOjRR43pgkWjN4Jeg3A,Mike Z.,"Bethesda, MD",5 star rating,"This quaint little restaurant (only 8-10 tables) has excellent food & service.  We chose this restaurant based upon reviews from the internet, and I think it lived up to the hype.  We visited Montreal for 4 days, and this was our favorite dining experience there.  We had the chicken heart pate as an appetizer. braised pork belly, & duck ravioli.  All were excellent.  Definitely recommended!"
/user_details?userid=RAzwrPeV5CPVdsLZn14gKg,Mario M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Possibly the best French restaurant I've ever been to, even after considering the mediocre ambience and setting. The food is perfect. The flavors compliment each other so well. The tasting menu was a great choice although I initially gave it little hope. I thought it was just another fancy resto that used eloquent descriptions for a so so product but I was wrong. I truly enjoyed my experience here."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We've been feasting with family and friends for an entire week and Les Deux Singes de Montarvie really stood out. It was probably the best meal we've had in a very long time. I love the fact that we were greeted with a special sign with our names on our tables. The attention to detail at this restaurant is exceptional. Each plate is presented as a piece of art and the edible flower petals and sprouts add a lovely touch. I would highly recommend this place for a special date or a celebration with family. I can't wait to go back again!
/user_details?userid=tphOpskuBA_Eu4Uil8WNkA,Brenda T.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Not sure what the naysayers are looking for in terms of food but in my opinion, this place has incredible food. We dined there on a Friday night (immediately upon arriving in Montreal and checking in) and we had an excellent experience.Service- 5/5: Our server was polite, funny, knowledgeable and very accommodating. She was not obtrusive but checked in enough to make else feel like we weren't forgotten. She even called us a cab!Space/Decor- 4/5: The place is definitely intimate. Which, coming from NYC, means it's small. However, you don't feel crowded and the patrons are able to have quiet conversations. The actual decor is on the rustic side.FOOD!!- 6/5: It was delicious. My dining companion was served a tuna carpaccio amuse bouche and, after discovering I was a vegetarian, she brought me a sambuca jello shot served in a frosted glass with a rim of pink peppercorns. Appetizer for him was a soup so good that he was still talking about it the next day. For me it was a salad of seasonal veggies which doesn't sound exciting but actually was. He had boar belly that made him want to lick the plate. I had a risotto that I couldn't do justice because I was too full. Presentation was nice, food tasty and portion sizes weren't grossly huge but more than enough to satiate."
/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is VERY special. Small but intimate, effortless cool invested in the decor (ape skull x-rays hung on lightboxes on the walls, brick, industrial lampshades), and absolutely sublime food. To understood how good it is, they once opened for breakfast a few years ago and served astounding dishes, like eggs in sunflower oil/milk and curry cakes, and the place was MOBBED by patrons. The owner/chef couldn't handle the load so he went back to lunch/dinner only.I would say this place probably rotates in the top three French restos in the entire city."
/user_details?userid=lD_9qhVvM7GTKsEgTwSeHA,Laura D.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This is such a great find. With only seating for about 25, is has that quaint European bistro feeling that could transport you just about anywhere. Food was delicious and spot on, cooked to perfection. A creative mix of flavors and colors and a presentation that would make any chef proud. I loved the open kitchen and especially the small chalk tablets placed on each table with the name of our reservation. Portion size was generous and well worth the extra $$."
/user_details?userid=wYuJmqgL15eZWsIQhcHwfw,Emily J.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Literally one of THE best meals my husband and I have ever had! A bit pricy but surprisingly decent portions for the prix-fix menu. Every dish was very unique and hand-crafted to perfection -- we could attest to this especially since we were sitting at the bar and watching the chefs work their magic, making sure each plate was impeccable. Most notable were the tender, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly over a mushroom risotto sauce, and the stuffed quail. The quail sauce had the perfect balance between sweet and savory. Overall the ambiance was also top notch. Not overly formal/snobby but classy at the same time. Very relaxing, and we felt the pace was perfect for a relaxing date night. There was absolutely no sense of feeling rushed. Although not the cheapest place ($60 per person for the prix-fix menu which included 4 dishes + dessert, leaving us perfectly satiated) but we definitely plan to return during our next trip back to Montreal!"

Its a very small place and the waitress had time to answer all our questions and make excellent recommendations. I think next time it would be cool to sit at the bar to see how they prepare the food.

/user_details?userid=Vlw4hkt4H5gS5wFcSuSTvw,Ashley S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"AMAZING. Fresh menu, small seven table atmosphere, great service but still casual. Literally from the soup to the dessert it was all 5 stars. It's not an ""In and out"" type place to so be prepared to take your time and enjoy each course as well as the company. The duck ravioli was amazing, and all of our entrees blew us away. And the dessert? Be sure to save room...life changing."
/user_details?userid=kt4Xh9ot13uAg5sG0ueYLg,Mike C.,"Morristown, NJ",5 star rating,An excellent meal.  Almost best I've had this year.  The attention to detail that goes into each plate is amazing.  Top marks on presentation.  Top marks on building layers of flavor.
/user_details?userid=IQffSz-un3GiJ3QMZS7DHA,joshua k.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Just sensational! Cozy place in Mile End Montreal that has everything going for it. Great ambiance, amazing dishes and excellent service. Every dish we consumed was superior. The two appetizers which were the baked endive salad and the duck risotto were beyond orgasmic. The mains, a curried red snapper and the emu special were great and the chocolate fondont dessert was wonderful as well. We eat out at home in NYC all the time and this might have been the best meal that I've eaten in years.I wish they would serve this stuff in Brooklyn. Did I mention that the duck risotto was stratospheric?"
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good but expectedly expensive French 'nouvelle' cuisine. Service is a bit slow. Place is a bit cramped. But the open kitchen runs the show, and everything I tasted there was very, very good. With less audacity than Le Cinquième Pêché, though."
/user_details?userid=BdBzXtp1yWntU_VqmG_XkQ,Mahsa Y.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"This is a teeny tiny restaurant, situated right next to the Soupe Soup on St. Viateur.  It is charming and cozy, with somewhat bizarre artwork (x-rays of monkeys?).  The menu is simple French fare -- two different types of steak, lobster sausage and duck risotto, and of course, fois gras and ris de veau.  It has an open kitchen, and dessert and wine options listed on the blackboards.  I saw one vegetarian option listed.  Definitely not a place for large groups -- when we went, it was mostly couples eating there.The service was excellent, and the food was cooked perfectly.  I had the bavette, which was very tasty, and had a bit of my husbands filet, which had hazelnuts on top -- which I didn't love, but the meat was cooked well.  Dessert was fondant au chocolat and ile flotant, both done very well.  We started with some amazing baguette from 3M bakery on Mont-Royal -- our server highly recommended visiting there for their pasteries as well, so we will.  It was about $50/person (with tax+tip) for our meal.I love this place for an intimate french dinner in our neighborhood, it was worth the money!"
/user_details?userid=1o6L04LdVzlB70pabo5G3g,Alexandria D.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I went here with a group of 5 people for dinner on December 30th, and while it may have been a quiet night due to the holidays, this was absolutely one of my favorite food experiences. We had incredible service from our very knowledgeable waiter (Pascal?). When one of our guests asked to substitute a side, he graciously asked that she try it first as it was meant to go with the dish, and if she did not like it, he would bring her something else. A very diplomatic approach to a common situation (and she loved it). We lingered for 3.5 hours, and never felt rushed. Our waiter was also kind enough to split our check up without us even asking (even dividing a shared appetizer and a couple of bottles of wine among all of us). That would NEVER happen in NYC. I was truly impressed. Amazing service, cozy yet refined ambiance, and delicious, straightforward food. I will definitely go back next time I am in Montreal."
