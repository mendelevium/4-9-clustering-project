So many different pizza parlours today and pretty much all good but this one was different compared. I didn't get a pie because they only have 16 inch and that was way too much. I took 2 different slices and they are quite big pieces. Cheese and pepperoni was to die for. The difference was the pepperoni which I found was nicely cured with a intense flavour which makes the difference from every other place I've been or ordered from. They were thin Â slices made from sour dough which made it very light and crusty. Last minute in taking the Caesar salad which was tasty but pricey. Overall I will return to have the NY pizza because that what it reminded me of, I was satisfied of my pizza craving. Lol"
