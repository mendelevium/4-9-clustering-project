This place is a small cafe that also offers very gourmet ""tartines"" (Open faces sandwiches). We were a group of 6 and they easily accommodates us on a Saturday morning. We were so impressed with the service and the food !Shakshuka with merguez was cooked to perfection. Gourmet tartines were so tasty, yet delicate and made with finesse. We also had My only regret was agreeing to share, I could've eaten my weights' worth ... everything was just so good Â :)"

Generally, I get the Raquel sandwich which has smoked chicken and Avocado. Sandwiches are on the pricier side (10-13$) but they are TRUELY unique. They are served on fresh bread, which is very airy and not to heavy. I love the kettle chips that come with the sandwiches as well! Other friends of mine have gotten the smoked meat sandwich and LOVE it. They don't have tons and tons of options on their menu...but what they do have, they do it very well and I really appreciate that!For my first time today I got the lentil soup (4.5$) and it was amazing! My only critique would be that I wish I could get a half sandwich combo...I found I didn't have enough space in my stomach for all the delicious food! Service is cafe style, order at a counter, pay, and they'll bring it to you. I really enjoyed that the chef came and checked on how we were liking everything, it felt like he cared and added a nice touch!"

I ordered the smoked beef brisket sandwich but asked them if I could skip the bread because I'm trying to avoid carbs. They not only skipped the bread the made sure to avoid other carb heavy items such as the chips and paired it with a really delicious green salad instead. The smoked beef brisket is to die for. I could easily see myself sitting there for a long time just eating their smoked meat. With rick salt sprinkled on it, the flavour just pops out in your mouth. Super awesome.Staff was very friendly, I walked in with a smile and walked out grinning from the great meal."

This is some of the best food we've eaten on our trip. (And having gone to Au Pied de Cochon last night, that's saying something) Sandwiches are creative but not fussy. Ingredients are super fresh and meat is smoked in house. Seasonal soup sides, we had the red gazpacho and it was perfectly balanced and a good foil to the richness of the sandwiches. We went for the Sylvie (smoked meat/cheese/frites) and the one with merguez sausage inspired by one of the owner's heritage. Both were fantastic. Would happily go back for the vegan Bahn Mi or any of the other options. Everything on the small but well curated menu sounded great. Space is modern and welcoming. Makes you want to stay a while. Staff is so friendly we asked for a picture with the chef and owner. I'd say go here soon - no doubt there will be lines once word gets out."
