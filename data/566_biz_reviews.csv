Decided to order pho from this restaurant from Uber Eats and was not disappointed. Food arrived promptly, quality packaging and generous portions! I've never been to the restaurant in person yet, but I plan to go at a later possible date for the complete experience!Tip: If you order delivery, reheat the soup so it's super hot and fresh when you add it to your rice noodles :)"
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm not an expert in Pho, haven't tried many places to compare, but I liked it. They open on late hours during this pandemic so it is pretty convenient when you don't feel like cooking and you are walking nearby. You just order inside, then wait outside, 10 min later your order will be ready. So they put the broth in one container and then the rest in a soup pot. When you arrive home, you can combine the whole thing so your noodles don't become mushy. Broth is pretty tasty. On this picture I tried the meatballs option, but I prefer another option that they have which has all sorts of meats, that one is very good. I also ordered a grilled chicken and it was very good as well. They will add as well very nice sauces on the side like Hoisin sauce or hot sauce, and some mung bean sprouts and mint. And of course, they do have delivery."

/user_details?userid=ryQsc-8qVknTl3j0TWGukA,Rc L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Mehh. This place is definitely below average. The soup is lukewarm, the peanut sauce is super watery and the salad rolls are not wrapped well. Had the beef pho and the meat was all fat. Broth didn't have much flavour. Price point is not worth the quality. The service was very callous as well. You'd be better off elsewhere if you're craving pho."
/user_details?userid=09maL_m5yM-2RwPf9DW0Sg,John H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",4 star rating,Not the best but not the worst either.  The delivery from Uber Eats came fast and nicely presented.   The bun bo hue broth was flavorful and spicy which is how I like it.
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my go-to pho place now, every time I eat there I am surprised by how good their pho is. My previous go to was another Pho place nearby but this place really goes all out with the broth and ingredients. I usually get the grilled chicken pho which really does the trick especially in our dark and cold winters. I'm super glad this place popped up In this city and I'm excited to keep coming back to it!"
/user_details?userid=-a0XgJCXoJln2Ue_JMnfIQ,Jules D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The place itself is nice and cozy. However I was not that impressed by the food. I ordered the mini pho + the vermicelli with chicken and egg roll. Came out to $20 with tip. Not that bad but not that cheap either. The food was a bit too salty (pho) and too sweet (vietnamese dipping sauce) for my taste. I usually like to drink the broth but I couldn't without risking heartburn. The waitress was very lackluster. No smile, and didn't give me any water. I might return if I'm in the area but wouldn't actively go there.Edit: I was very thirsty after and chugging water which is rare. Probably an indicator of lots of sodium/msg :/"
/user_details?userid=t8It5uEd9bpcUDfcMJ1w_g,Yulia S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Not impressed, the noodles were too soft and the soup was lacking in flavour. Pho places in Chinatown are much better.Another small incident that happened was that the lady at the cash pulled my arm and said that the tip was not enough when I did enter a 15% tip for a pho order of about 10$ and turned around to leave, so I put another loonie on the counter without thinking, and only then I saw they charged me for a large bowl even though I actually had a medium bowl. Since I already paid with credit card and she took the extra tip, she wouldn't correct it. The 1$ difference was nothing, however I wasn't happy with the service attitude here."
/user_details?userid=RzNwfQIxlTBwEunGs-c0fQ,Kelly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,Taste is not really bad was okay but it's full of msg. We got really thirsty after having pho there. Do not recommend.
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I absolutely loved this place. What a great bowl of pho! I went with the pho tai (rare beef soup). They have 2 sizes: regular ($10) and large ($11.50). The large bowl is great if you have a huge appetite! Lots of noodles and meat in every bowl. And the flavour of the soup was fantastic. Definitely one of the best pho restaurants in the downtown core.
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"For many Yelpers that read my review know that I am a big fan of Pho. I've been to this place a couple of time and I gotta say, their pho soup is tasty, the meat are tendered.The decor of place is trendy, cozy and clean. Especially the location, it's right in the heart of downtown (Guy Corcordia) area. If you need a quick fix of Pho, this is the place.Now you may wonder why I gave 2 stars and not more, it is due to my most recent experience. I ordered delivery and it had a small little problem... And when I reported the issue to the restaurant, their reaction is unacceptable.So I ordered, 1 regular size & 1 extra large pho. When it arrived, they have identify on the box which one is which but when I open box and realize both has the same amount of meat and noodles. So I decided to make a courtoisie and report the issue. Instead of listening to my comment, the worker (not sure if it's the owner or just their waitress), started educate me by saying ""it's identified on the box, I don't understand why you are confused bla bla"", I had to yell out ""Would you listen to me first?""Then she said ""Oh, well since the order is out now there's nothing I can do, when you place an order next time, maybe you can write in the comment"" right there. I lost it, I told her I was not expecting you do anything this time and there will be no next time. This is pretty much a scam. They have great food quality and it is so sad to have such a reaction that they are on denial.I still recommend people to eat there, just be careful on what you order and just don't get any delivery or take out."
/user_details?userid=apKeLCsgb-VBYogvv8KiuA,Marci B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"My AirBnb host recommended this place. What a great find. The prices are extremely reasonable and the pho is absolutely delicious with  flavors that abound. The service was exceptional. I cannot eat gluten, and they accommodated me by using rice noodles. I was so happy.  Good place for healthy, nourishing, tasteful food at a great price. My dinner was only $10 -  I ordered the smaller serving and it was more than enough."
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is definitely one of my favorite pho spots in Montreal. Their service is quick, nice and the restaurant is always clean. Plus their phos are great. My personal favorite is their Bun Bo Hue. It's packed with authentic flavors and the portions are good. The prices are also very affordable and the best part of this place is their homemade spicy sauce. You can find it on the tables in these big jars and they add such a great savory kick."
/user_details?userid=9trVtlHk5WlfuGO7_hjjTw,E L.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Two dinners in a row. We were very pleased after each meal. My wife is VN and she loved the authentic taste and appearance of the food. The place is small, but service was good and quick. They also run the VN Sandwich shop below it. I'll definitely be back to grab an Banh Mi."
/user_details?userid=PCKiyfW_x03JpZAUeGde5g,D Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2 star rating,"Pros:-Food is good. Pho, beef satay, egg rolls - all tasty. -Cute place with pleasant decor-Super convenient being right across from Guy metro. - Very reasonably priced. Cons:Waitress provided terrible service. She automatically set down glasses of cold water and when my mom asked if she could also get a cup of hot water, she snatched the cold water out of my mother's hand and stormed off in a huff. She returned later with what was clearly hot tap water (vs hot boiled water like you would use for tea). My mother literally spit it out because it was so gross.  I would have said something to the waitress  except she never came back once to check on us.  They weren't that busy so there was no excuse for lack of service. This waitress, and the other one working, never once cracked a smile.  They seemed miserable and put that misery onto their customers."

The food is really good. My son is a picky eater, but he finished the entire bowl of noodle. The porkc over rice is a must try! I would highly recommend it to my friends and family. The waiter is extremely nice."

The food was amazing! We had the bun bo hue and rice with chicken. The food was authentic!! The service was great, very quick to bring out the food. The Vietnamese ice coffee was also a delight!"

/user_details?userid=9hx3iH0eTk-X7o67W5BJaQ,Pedro D.,"Irvington, NY",5 star rating,"I MADE A MISTAKE IN ADDING THIS RESTAURANT BY THE NAME. THE REAL NAME IS ""I AM PHO"", BUT BY LOOKING AT THEIR BUSINESS CARD, YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'S EASY TO MISS THE REAL NAME. Wow, what a great find. I flew into Montreal, just for one night. I only really had time to venture for a quick lunch, right after checking into the Best Western Ville Marie. My cellphone was having trouble connecting to the data celular line while I walked and so my trusty Yelp app was rendered unusable. I proceeded to walk aimlessly, trying to follow the bands of students who seemed to come and go though different halls of Magill university. I asked around without sounding like a homeless person, mostly where the good Asian restaurants where in the area. I had a lust for psome good Thai or Vietnamese, which is always a good bet in Montreal. My previous culinary experiences included ""au pied de cochon"" and various Thai and Middle Eastern joints, but this would only make my third visit to Montreal. Looking for something apparently Vietnamese that a young man pointed towards, I stumbled upon this place. It's a small unassuming room on the second floor of a small building. The menu on a blackboard on the wall but also mini blackboards with specials of the day. I had the cold rolls for an appetizer which were very fresh and generous. The sauce was very appetizing. I then had the grilled pork chop pho, a regular menu item on the board. The pork was cooked really well and it had great color as well as taste. The rice vermicelli was delightful and so were the ingredients that completed this simple and effective dish. The lady that attended me was courteous but unusually honest and suggested what would be the proper amount of food for me to order. Therefore, she adviced against ordering both the ""three color coconut"" and the Vietnamese coffee. ""too much sweet"", she said. Although I have been to Hanoi and had plenty of such coffee at the hotel, she brought a small metal percolator that sat on top of the coffee cup and also a big mug full of ice. After I got over my embarrassment of not understanding what's going on, I asked for help. She told me that I had to wait until all of the coffee had drained to the bottom, then stir the condensed milk at the bottom vigorously. Only after that, I should really pour over the hot coffee into the iced mug. I vacilated, somehow I wanted my coffee hot, but once again and very frankly, she indicated that it'd be best to water down a little because it's otherwise too sweet. And she was right! It was both coffee and dessert. I spoke to the owner briefly, mostly because I tried to talk him out of playing the ""Asian pop massage new age never-ending"" never resolving music. I said : ""play the music of your grandparents"" the beautiful folk music of monochord and drums, etc. He shrugged my comments and we spoke about new york, Queens, the best Vietnamese restaurants there and, why so many of the ones in the west side closed. He told me that this restaurant is relatively new. I would definitely come back soon if I knew when I will be back. The prices are reasonable and I don't think they will have a problem drawing large crowds."

The meat were soft and tender while packed with a lot of flavour! I also tried some of my friend's pho and it was so good! The flavour was authentic with a decent amount of pho and rare beef. They don't cheap out!
