/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This brunch place is a Montreal classic. It is a must try when living in/visiting Montreal. We arrived on a weekend at noon and were seated within 20 minutes (for a group of 4, that's pretty good). The line was not so bad considering it was a weekend and the perfect time for brunch. The hostess was super friendly and kept trying to get as many people inside the restaurant as possible to keep them warm. I ordered the salami omelette and was quite satisfied. It came with a bagel and potatoes on the side and I found it to be priced fairly reasonable for such an establishment.The bagel came out toasted and so the butter melted right on top of it. The potatoes were sort of mashed up and crisped to get some crunchy texture which I found to be amazing and very different from most brunch restaurants.As for the salami omelette, I loved it. It had enough saltiness from the salami that it did not need additional seasoning. The salami pieces were not cut up into pieces allowing you to actually taste it and size then yourself. Also, there was much more salami than I had expected but not too much that it was overpowering. Overall, delicious meal. The service, however, was alright. I found that each request I made was not received so pleasantly. For example, I requested a plate so that I can have a bite of my girlfriend's challah French toast and felt like it was a sin to do so! It did get better though. I requested some more water later on and found that our waitress made more of an effort of being more friendly. The challah French toast by the way was amazing! It was cooked perfectly and had the perfect texture that it would just melt in your mouth. The syrup was also given ""on tap"" which is now, unfortunately, a plus! (Some restaurants now charge for syrup...).  Overall, I really loved coming here as a kid and still do love coming here as an adult. Their portions are perfect and their prices are still reasonable. Can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=NVNI1BcvlD8U_b7Q9REBqg,Anya K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a really neat joint. It has that old diner thing going on, that I really love. There are lots of waiters, all keeping an eye on your coffee, if you need anything else, etc. I'm from Toronto and I feel the older, family business/mom & pop places are dying out, getting replaced by new trendy joints and condos. I was really pleasantly surprised to be here in Montreal, where the smaller family businesses still exist, and this place was no exception and it felt so... home-y, so family-y. It's bustling in the diner and the waiters are joking around and from just watching how people work with one another, you can tell they like eachother's company, which is really nice to see. On to the food: I ordered the SuperBeautys 2, because I kind of felt like everything - a couple of eggs, pancakes, sausages, bacon, lovely fried potatoes, and a nice Montreal bagel (which was delicious). It was a pretty giant meal so I ended up sharing with my partner, who got a side order of eggs and a bagel cream cheese lox (also delicious), which had lovely thick and fresh slices of tomato, as well as some red onion. I'd have to say I really enjoyed the bagels, they were perfect. The potatoes were a nice touch as well because of how they were prepared - nice and fried but not dry or oily and almost mashed in some bits - really tasty! The rest of the food was pretty good as well. I also had a cafe lait, which was quite nice. All in all I would definitely recommend this place, it's a vintage gem."
/user_details?userid=BPctreQAlxlXTCNdRfdG-w,Stephanie F.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"I stumbled upon Beauty's by happenstance when all of the restaurants I had bookmarked on Yelp were closed on New Year's Day. They do not take reservations or take your name upon arrival... you simply stand in line the old fashioned way to be seated. Naturally, it was packed, yet the wait for bar seating was only 15 minutes or so. I ordered a Bloody Mary and was served a tray with all of the fixings to assemble myself. The presentation was adorable and I actually prefer to make my own so I can load up on the horseradish and hot sauce. After a night out for New Year's Eve, we were ready for a feast and Beauty's delivered. To start, we shared a Montreal style bagel. It came with with complimentary jelly but we opted to order cream cheese. I was very excited to try this bagel considering they are known to rival New York style. The Montreal bagel was fluffy, sweet, and coated with sesame seeds. Enjoyable, but not as good as NY... sorry not sorry!For my entree, I had the bacon egg tomato and cheese sandwich which was HUGE and served on buttery garlicky toast (dare I say Texas toast?) I also ordered a side of chicken salad thinking I would combine but the chicken salad was delicious on its own.. on the sweeter side, good crunch, and a hint of dill. My dining partner had the super beauty which was basically a grand slam.. also huge. Note- certain things you have to order separately for an up charge like cream cheese and maple syrup. The service was extremely friendly. It's a family owned business that has been passed down from generation to generation. The owner and his daughter couldn't have been friendlier and loved chatting with us about Philadelphia!"
/user_details?userid=NnjWR_EcNdHfV9P4qfSs8Q,Jeremiah H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you like chopped liver, Beauty's is the place to go. You get a scoop of chopped chicken liver, on a bed of veggies, a side of gravy, topped with clarified onions. Delicious! But Beauty's, (along with other Montreal institutions like Schwartz's), is cursed with having to live up to all the hype. Nevertheless, Beauty's offers a decent breakfast. They also make a good burger which they won't over cook if you ask for it rare. This is something most restaurants refuse to do, (citing health reasons). Try the classic smoked salmon on a bagel with cream cheese."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"Never realized this place was here until I was doing my groceries at the provigo out front and I was waiting for my bus which is right in front of this restaurant. A cool old school brunch place! The decor is great. Only downside is it's really hot inside, it doesn't help that it's been way more humid than usual in Montreal lately. There was also flies flying around everywhere so the dining in experience wasn't great. I ordered a chocolate milkshake (good), the mac and cheese (only soso) and Adam got the salami sandwich and the blueberry milkshake (Good blueberry flavour and interesting aftertaste).I definitely want to come back and try their brunch options because I don't feel like I got the full experience."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I live few minutes walk from this place and often pass it by on my way to the grocery store. It seems like a popular place with constant line ups on the weekend. The diner's atmosphere is relaxed and the service is great and fast. There is no line up on the weekdays and your order is served pretty quickly so definitely a place to keep in mind if you're in rush.I'll probably be back there soon again.
/user_details?userid=ul2N2IiGEenztm5GTMdsmQ,Lauren H.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"It's cool this has been around so long but there is nothing special about the food. Don't get me wrong the food is good, just not great."
/user_details?userid=SXqG5uIkv_NgRFJXqcQfww,Robert F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was having a quick one hour meeting with a good friend of mine, we were rushed to place the order when the place was half empty.  That wasn't so bad, when the food arrived, my friends smoked salmon bagel had three 1-inch slices of tomato, which was just weird. And my eggs came flooded in water and oil, and were under cooked.We were so busy in our conversation, not even finished our meal before the lady with bizarre sunglasses puts the bill on the table.  I then had a moment to tell her about the food and she came out with terrible excuses of the ""chef is tired"" and ""we never get complaints"", instead of apologizing or offering to do something, she then blamed me for not saying something earlier.We hadn't even been in the restaurant 45 minutes before more staff coming up to our table and clearing our glasses of water and coffee mugs on at least two occasions. We kept saying just leave it were not finished.Honestly, since the passing of the owner. This place has turned to crap. Terrible service and that woman with sunglasses is just rude."
/user_details?userid=RoDBSaDYLbxGucOChhgxjA,Franny F.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"Great retro breakfast spot with great service. I kept it simple with the food but enjoyed the coffee, vodka + fresh OJ, and a green smoothie to go. The place is small so the bar is perfect if you're a party of 2 or 3. This place seems to be a local favorite so I'm glad I got to try it during my visit. If ever back in this city, id definitely stop in again."
/user_details?userid=2uBbhf4dHL54V9sDNkyWRw,Ada C.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,I ordered wrong - veggie melt which was not the grilled cheese with veg I was expecting but rather a lightly toasted sandwich instead. My friend got the smoked salmon bagel which looked amazing and messy!I'd come back but definitely order something different.
/user_details?userid=8B21It8gt4256uBXOVI2mA,Erika G.,"Secaucus, NJ",5 star rating,"Wasn't sure what to get so I got the Beauty's ""Classic"" which is a lox bagel I believe. It was yummy but nothing life changing. The pancakes, however, were the best pancakes I've ever had-- and I eat a lot of pancakes. Service was friendly and place was clean."
/user_details?userid=CgQsF5wV1_vz5KSBghYCwQ,Tom T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Beauty's has been around since 1945 and you certainly get that retro vibe the moment you walk in. The service was fast and efficient. I had the Beauty's special #2 breakfast. Loved their pancakes! They had a dense texture which absorbed the maple syrup so well!! Ask for the bagel instead of toast. It's delicious!! Along with their freshly squeezed orange juice, they had bagels and lox which seemed to be very popular items with the locals. Decent portion size as well!! Get here early because the line ups for breakfast / brunch are long. I'm going to make this a go to spot whenever I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=RbCH1Z_WClQmeA7--V1KcA,Mark G.,"Dallas, TX",3 star rating,"Look this place really gives you that true Diner feel. Like you stepped back in time to the 1950s, and I loved it. It was great. But they sure make you pay for it. I got the MishMash omelet with potatoes and it came with (what I thought was the best part of the meal) the St. Viateur Bagel. I asked for cream cheese and that was an additional 3 bucks. I also had coffee with that. 20 bucks later I'm looking down at my food and wondering, really all this for 20 bucks. This better be delicious. And, it was ok at best. It wasn't terrible. It just wasn't great. Like I said the best part of my meal was the bagel I could down the street for 90 cents. All in all I'm not saying I would not come back here. I would. I would just order differently. My best advice, just order a bagel sandwich and enjoy. I do hope this place sticks around though. Places that hold on to history and heritage are more important than ever nowadays."
/user_details?userid=YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I love diners. Nothing like finding a good diner when travelling. This one was a real Beauty!An old school diner classic in Montreal. Retro look and feel, along with a menu of diner staples.People around these parts told me to get something on a bagel. They actually have pretty decent bagels in Montreal so I took their advice.Get the do it yourself Bloody Mary's and the ""Beauty's Special"" lox on a bagel. Thank me later. It's more than enough to satisfy. Yum!Cool and simple, and it was a lot of fun to get a tray of ingredients to build our own bloody's. I was able to squeak out a few with what they gave us.Perfect way to spend a few hours on a weekday afternoon in a classic joint chatting with the original owner Hymie and his son, the present owner Larry. A Montreal institution that is worthy of the distinction."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Maybe its the fact that I had such a high expectation from this place. Over a year I walked by it and saw the long waiting lines during weekends. Last week I had a chance to go try it with a friend visiting from NY, Friday morning, no lines, sweet. The service was excellent, the food was great but well nothing that made me say ""I MUST RE-VISIT"". I had a good time and a good expirience but this is just one more great dinner in Montreal..."
/user_details?userid=NYuQCn0F0UcGPEJ0i1B4-A,Danielle V.,"Lilburn, GA",4 star rating,"I visited Beauty's on a friend's recommendation while I was visiting Montréal. It was early afternoon on a Sunday and the place was packed with a line out the door. The line moved reasonably quickly and I was seated at the counter within about 10-15 minutes. The atmosphere was great, with an old school diner vibe and friendly service. I ordered chocolate chip waffles and eggs, bacon and home fries. My food was great, and I was absolutely stuffed full when I was finished. This isn't the place to go if you are in a rush or on a tight budget, but definitely worth a visit."
/user_details?userid=67Aj5cW5xS6OkvNj6kcvsw,Hannah G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Beauty's is the ULTIMATE old school brunch experience. Cozy booths, waiters bustling around constantly refilling your coffee, big portions, brunch classics, and bagels with butter and jam as an appetizer?? Yes, please! The two times I have gone to Beauty's I have left with a smile on my face that only a good brunch can bring. I went to Beauty's with a friend and we shared an order of banana pancakes and an onion, mushroom, and swiss omelette that came with potatoes and a classic St. Viateur Montreal bagel. It was all reasonably priced. Honestly, the food is not the main reason for my love of Beauty's. It is not the highest quality brunch food I have had, but it is a really fun experience and the food definitely hits the spot. I will definitely keep coming back."
/user_details?userid=Swg25cbrorgd-PpmiZv7sg,Erin L.,"Floral Park, NY",1 star rating,"Could not even eat here.  walked in and felt I was in a truck stop bathroom.  Smelled like a urinal.  Also, the lady didn't greet us.  Not at all welcoming.  We walked out and will never be back."
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",4 star rating,"Ducking into this cozy, intimate diner on a raw and rainy Sunday morning with my sweetie was the perfect remedy to our late night out. Looking for comfort and stick-to-your-ribs kind of food, Beauty's delivered on all fronts.  From our bottomless mugs of coffee to the ""do not miss"" Bloody Mary DIY service, we accompanied these libations with a spread fit for the pair of hungry and hungover customers that we were: my bagel sandwich with fried eggs, bacon, and cheese (The Bonjour Beauty made with the best bagels in the city - St.Viateur) and my husband's egg, ham, and hash brown special fit the bill in the best possible way.  No haute cuisine.  No hipster remakes.  No pretentious brunch.  Service was friendly and prompt, and not at all perfunctorily given the iconic fame of Beautys. Just a perfect breakfast in a joint others were queuing up at the door by the time we left."

/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"What a fantastic, wholesome, heart-warming experience it was to come here for a Sunday brunch! Luckily, we got there before the big lineup outside happened, so I recommend getting yourself settled in before 11am. I knew nothing about Beauty's before I walked in the door, but I feel like I now have a fuller appreciation of this part of Montreal, where Beauty's has been established since 1942! You know all those new hipster diner-esque cafés that you'll find elsewhere around Montreal? Well, they're ALL trying to be this. Beauty's is THE authentic, real-deal Montreal brunch diner -- the original. In fact, they invented the Montreal Brunch. The history behind Beauty's is rich and solid. While we were seated at the lunch counter, which overlooks a gorgeous stylized stainless steel wall with shelves full of antiques as the main feature in kitchen, we had the opportunity to hear a little bit of the family history from the family itself. ""Beauty"" is actually the nickname of the original owner, Hymie, from his bowling league days, and became the name of this famous restaurant after its loyal clientele dubbed it so. Situated in the historical Jewish garment district, Beauty's is a long-standing inter-generational Jewish family affair, an exemplary successful family-run business. Hymie was behind the counter, as well as his son, Larry, who now runs the business. Larry was a laugh and a half, and so warm and open and welcoming! Our brunch was your standard issue eggs and bacon done to perfection. I got my runny yolk fix, which I hungrily sopped up with a toasted St Viateur bagel. Their pancakes are classic grandma's kitchen style, light and fluffy. The BACON was crisp and the best-cooked I've had at any brunch spot in Montreal. I know that Beauty's is best known for its stellar bagel and lox, so I'll be wolfing that down the next time I'm in, and yes, this will be a regular brunch locay for me. Also, I almost left with a bunch of Beauty's swag, because it's really nice - I mean, who wouldn't want to wear a toque that says, ""Beauty's"" in trucker-style scroll lettering on the front? I plan to pick up one of their Beauty's diner coffee mugs with the 40s starlet logo on the front. If you aren't sure about getting the swag just yet, Larry will invite you to leave with as many as you want of their lovely vintage-photo postcards. This place made my weekend complete. Thanks, Larry and all the friendly service staff who kept me topped up with that endless cup of diner coffee! We love you."

We got lucky and went right in after only a few minutes outside in line. My special was really good. Bagel, smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, red onion. The bagel was packed full of toppings and well-balanced. My wife's burger wasn't as good, possibly a frozen patty. The ambiance was great though; a classic diner room inside with lots of character. I probably wouldn't line up for an hour but I wouldn't hesitate to come back if I could get in quickly."
/user_details?userid=6oljgiQto2Dkbn034ixA9Q,Leila H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Got there at 10sh on Wednesday. Maybe 3 tables of 2 were taken and the rest was empty. No one greets you with a smile and a good morning or hi or even a thank you or bye. We were a party of 4 ,the other 2 friends were late so they refused to seat us even though it was empty and even if we said we wanted to have coffee. Very unpleasant attitude. Its the type of breakfast that would be served in middle of nowhere on a highway or something. Grated potatoes were cold, eggs are just regular, pancakes are Aunt jemima's mix style, only thing was good was the St-VIATEUR bagel. They serve normal syrup and if you want maple syrup its 4$ for a few measured ml. Lmao. I definitely need to stop following the hypes on social media. There are soooo many amazing breakfast spots in mtl wth was this."
/user_details?userid=cowrs1tug_s6VZfoMkChIg,Alexander M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Decided to visit since it has so much history in Montreal. Was happy with brunch but not swept off my feet, so to speak.Food: we had the super beautys 2 and the salmon bagel. Both were great - but they're pretty hard to get wrong in the first place.Service: food came fast and service was nice. I'm aware that people sometimes wait very long to get in here, but we went very early.Price: could be better since it's pretty simple for brunch plates. Not too bad though.Ambiance: old school diner feel, but had no music when I was there which was strange feeling with few other customers around at that time in the morning."

Pour me a cup of joe with a saucer place. Gimme some milkshake options and standard diner grub and I'm a happy girl. Seriously though. Be still my breakfast-loving heart. This place serves soft ice cream as well. The kid in me was dying because it was socially acceptable to order a breakfast meal with ice cream. Naturally I opted for the waffle with fruit and ice cream. It was perfect. Waffle and fruit and ice cream in every bite. If that's wrong, I don't want to be right. The servings are good, big portions. I was happy with my waffle, giant cup of fruit and a giant cup of ice cream. It was both refreshing and filling without being too sweat. It was a beauty. ;)"
/user_details?userid=BG0dgrXMWrL3FEWJU7d3Tw,Eric M.,"El Paso, TX",3 star rating,"Mi cugino and I went to Montreal for his Spring Break.  It was our international gastronomic adventure. This place had very many high reviews, but I think it was actually the low point on the food tour that we took.  As we walked in, some man at the front asked how many, but seemed irritated that there were two of us. ""We can't seat two at a time like this,"" he told his coworker.  Um...ok.  I guess when you're this popular you don't have to care if a guest feels welcomed.  He advised we wait outside in the glassed in area, which we did four about 5 minutes.  When we did get seated, it was at the bar which was reminiscent of the diners you see in movies about New York.  The servers were nice, kept making sure we were taken care of and that our beverages weren't empty. Since we were right by the waitress station, I had the privilege to hear the waitress talk about the drop dead gorgeous customer with a POS attitude.The food was average.  I wouldn't call it bad, but it really had nothing to draw me back.  I got the special which is a bagel with schmear and lox, heavy on the cream cheese, light on the salmon.    The side of hashbrowns were nice and crispy and man, they kept slinging those suckers out! I was kind of turned off when the cook checked his phone and then went back to work.  I know this happens, but when you see it, it makes it real!"
/user_details?userid=rPIQiemmu6kX3WX7xUUJnQ,Ashley A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Gotta love Beauty's...Cozy old school dinette with a nice buzz when it's busy.I like the booths but the counter seating is better if you like to share your food with your partner.I ordered the blintzes with fruit and sour cream. My partner ordered the monterey omelette which basically comes with salsa and cheddar cheese. Those two items are very complementary - the blintzes are a bit bland and the omelette has a bit of a kick so sharing those two is better than having either on its own.I also ordered the blueberry smoothie. So good.I would definitely recommend this spot.

Though, I was slightly disappointed. I had ordered Beauty's Basic, and though the eggs and sausage were great, the bagel was hard as a rock. Despite this, I can appreciate the great service, not only from the wait staff, but also from the staff managing the long line. They were all smiles, it was lovely to see! I can tell they were insanely busy, and that may have affected the food output. Otherwise, this was a decent experience."

It exists in some form probably in every city on the world. And it's largely forgettable. Pancakes are good but gritty. I believe they use cornmeal. The syrup will easily run off the plate because it's not thick at all. The bacon is much too salty. There are much better brunch places in Montreal."

On my last day in Montreal, decided to come here for a club sandwich and boy, was I not disappointed. First of all, my pal and I arrived just after the lunch rush. It was still busy, but we were able to snag a booth in no time. We both ordered up a cup of diner coffee, because how can you not? Settled into the comfy, worn in booths and poured over the menu. To be honest, the breakfast (served all day here) is worth it. You might even want to invest in one of their milkshakes. I didn't this time around, as mentioned. The club sandwich is actually sectioned under the ""burger"" menu and is $13. It has three layers of goodness and the waitress will bring you extra mayo without even having to ask. The chicken is juicy. The bacon, crispy. The people watching, wonderful. The staff were super kind and accommodating. I wish we had a Beauty's Luncheonette in Toronto, to be honest."

The guy that runs it Hymie greets you at the door. It took us about 20 minutes or so to get a table which was at Sunday brunch time which i would imagine is peak time so it was not too bad. The food was great, it was classic american style brunch with pancakes, bagels, cream cheese, bacon, milkshakes and everything you would ever want to start off a great Sunday possibly after long Saturday night. There was a nice vibe about the place which added to it. I was so full i could barely move afterwards. The price i thought was fairly costly for the type of food it is but still good. My admiration for this place is the history and the fact its been a family business since 1942. I always respect places like this. Make sure to get one of their milkshakes they are insane."

It was one of the stops along the ""Beyond The Bagel"" food tour we went on but we only passed by so we decided to come back for brunch. It did not disappoint! The owner was sitting by the door greeting customers which was charming in and of itself but the food was really delicious. We wanted to try the two specialties: bagel with lox and cream cheese and the mish-mash omelette with sausage, hot dog and green peppers. Both dishes were incredible! I was hesitant to try the omelette since I would never think to put hot dogs and eggs together but wow, it was so good. The home fries were really yummy too; I loved that they were light and flat rather than just potato chunks. I wish I could come here for breakfast every week and would suggest it to anyone who loves the atmosphere of diners and/or GOOD FOOD."

/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Fancy? No. Delicious? Oh YES!This place has been around for a gazillion years. My dad went here as a teen. I went here when I was a teen. I recently brought my teen kids here on our last visit to Montreal. It was exactly, EXACTLY as I remember it: line of folks waiting to get in, fuddy duddy non-descript décor with vinyl booths and linoleum everywhere, Hymie at the front door trying to get lingerers to vacate their tables, the counter, the Beauty's merchandise for sale at the cash up front, the posted photos of staff in their travels, the dinky booths in the back by the toilets (no one wants to sit there, for good reason! They're right by the toilets! It's also quite dim and dingy back in the restaurant here, without the benefit of natural light from the windows), and the knowledge that you could return in another 50 years and the place would look exactly the same. The food is hit or miss, but their bagels with cream cheese will always be the cornerstone of their menu, for good reason. It's exactly what I miss, living now in Seattle: perfect Montreal bagels with the best cream cheese with lox and onions and tomatoes. To me, this is the perfect meal! Seriously, it's wonderful. The sandwiches here are made with challah bread, as is the toast, so need I tell you, it's all delicious.  The service can be great or not so great, depending on your luck of servers. On our most recent visit, we had a lady who was hesitant to give me change for the meter (there's only meter parking outside on the street), despite my having the currency bills. I didn't understand her reluctance; she said we should pay with my credit card. She acted like I was really putting her out. What gives?The price of food is somewhat high, but to me, it's worth it for the taste of tradition and my beloved Beauty's bagels!"
/user_details?userid=eNORuY4cjyQStMygVSSYZQ,Meimei Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"A very classic brunch spot in the plateau. The restaurant is very retro-chic, something straight out of a 1940s film. The menu is well varied and includes all the Montreal classics, like their delicious smoked salmon bagel. The french toasts are very good, and are always one of my favourites here. The portions are big so the price is very decent. During the winter there is sometimes a bit of a wait, but once you get inside you will instantly forget about the cold. :)"

We experienced basic diner food and was not at all impressed. The bagels were great but they are better at the St Viature shop with cream cheese hot out of the oven. I think people go here for the cheap diner food and the story. Nothing else. You could definitely find a better place with no line and better food.

Open since 1942 this place has an history and you are still welcome by the owner of the place a short and sweet man really friendly. The place is small so be sure that you will be facing a line up especially around 10:30 to 1pm. But the food is worth of the wait. I heard that the pancakes were delicious so of course I ordered some. In fact with my friend we shared 2 plates : the smoked salmon bagel (a huge bagel full of tomatoes and cream cheese) and also the beauty's specialty (a plate with pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and bagel on the side). What a great meal. I am a fan of brunch and for sure I will come back. The service is old fashion, friendly, waitresses seemed to know all the regular guests, they want you to feel comfy a little bit at home and it works perfectly. Coffee is also really good and that's a plus for them. Finally, really affordable, we love that! I remove a star because of the lack of the comfort on the seats (table of 2 are for tinny people lol) and also because of the kitchen noise."

I ordered mac and cheese. Came with a green salad and balsamic vinaigrette. I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese. While it looked better than Kraft Dinner, it tasted very similar. It had bread crumbs on top which was great but the mac and cheese itself was not impressive. Not worth the $14. The serving was big to get me full but taste wasn't great. My friends ordered pancakes. They seemed OK. It looked like the food overall was OK. The atmosphere was nice however. Lots of families or friends catching up. 4/5 for service and atmosphere.2/5 for food."

"" Damn, this must be good"" I thought.We ordered omelettes, french toast and some trademark smoothies.We were promptly served. To be perfectly candid, the food was ok, you can have this at any other breakfast place. Surprisingly, the bagels were really mediocre. The $6.5 smoothies are actually quite good and were the best part of the meal. You can come and have a filling breakfast but there is no enlightenment here."

Located in the Plateau Mont Royal district, Beauty has been around since 1942. It was opened by newlyweds Hymie and Freda Sckolnick. The name Beautys was actually Hymie's bowling nickname. It remains a family business to this day. For you - just know the Beautys Special (smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onions and tomato on a toasted sesame seed St-Viateur bagel).Beautys Special 11.50: This traditional lox is delicious! We liked the over the top slab of cream cheese and the combination of onions and tomatoes. The bagel was good but it was just a vehicle to carry everything.Beautys Smoothie 6.50: When you are at Beautys, also order the Beautys Smoothie Classico - strawberry, banana and orange. As the name suggests, a classic, fruity drink that just brightens the day. This diner is classic and very nostalgic. Seats may not be very comfortable but is a great mid-day or early morning breakfast spot. It is a great restaurant that won't break the bank. And if you looking to try the infamous Montreal bagel St. Viateur but is running out of stomache room to fit everything in; the Beautys Special brings that iconic Montreal experience along with the ""must eat"" factor!"

It was okay, maybe even pretty good, but not $11 good. I've had better for cheaper at numerous places in the city. One of my friends got blueberry pancakes, which were okay but you have to pay extra for maple syrup. We are in Quebec! That is not acceptable. Another one of my friends got a plate of eggs, potatoes, and bacon. I don't even know how they could have cooked the potatoes that badly. They were not quite burnt, but very hard and about a quarter of the portion was inedible.It wasn't too busy when I went as a group of 4 - a Friday (non-holiday) around 11 and there was no line.

Arriving at 1pm on a Sunday, the line extended out the door and snaked around the corner - I guess everybody else also came here after seeing some exceptional YELP reviews. After a half hour wait, we got seated in a booth and it felt like I was in a time warp. It had the classic American diner feel - vinyl booths, metal counter, and adorably sweet servers.  I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon on Challah bread while my friends' ordered pancakes and Beauty's trademarked MISH MASH omelette. The grilled cheese was fantastically greasy (I would've preferred a less processed tasting cheddar), and from what I could tell after stealing a couple bites, the pancakes were slightly crispy on the outside while still being perfectly fluffy inside. The MISH MASH was one of the best omelettes I've tasted. Overall, Beauty's is worth the wait - perfect for an indulgent Sunday brunch after a long night of Montreal partying."
/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",2 star rating,"For a second breakfast stop, my mother decided to sleep in (conserve capacity) while my aunt and I trekked to Beauty's, the 1942 bruncheonette on the corner of Mont Royal West and St. Urbain.  Perhaps not as famous as St. Viateur or Schwartz's, fans and the local media still place the small diner on the same ""Best of"" and ""Iconic"" lists and unlike the former, original owner Hymie Sckolnick is still involved as he approaches his tenth decade of life.With an opening hour of 7am, and after a near-ticket with a local police officer targeting people for taking left-turns on a nearby street we arrived at Beauty's perhaps fifteen minutes after opening and after looking at the myriad articles posted in the small entry way entered to find only a few locals sitting at the bar.  Greeted promptly by one of three servers we were led to a booth where menus were provided, coffee was ordered, and we were left to make our choices from a number of deli classics and a few Montreal specialties such as the ""Mish-Mash.""Sitting and browsing the menu as well as the space, Beauty's is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an old-school Jewish diner - kosher meats, a small selection of baked goods, and breakfast staples like pancakes, challah French toast, bagels, cream cheese, and lox in a room full of small booths and a long counter where short-order cooks quickly and quietly put together breakfast plates while chatting with the clientele while friendly waitresses performed their duties expediently.Orders placed and by now working on my second cup of thin but well flavored 'joe as my aunt sipped on a large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice it would not be long before our first item arrived - a small order of house made ""Pouding Au Riz"" for $4 plus a 40ml serving of pure maple syrup for $2.50.  Realizing, of course, that profit margins at a place like Beauty's are not that high and setting aside my general distaste for paying extra for a condiment I will say that the rice pudding itself was unremarkable in most ways - a bit too thick, a bit too congealed, and not enough of the golden raisins to balance the lack of vanilla or sweetness.  Adding a bit of the syrup helped, but I also had to conserve for my main course.Moving next to the aforementioned mains, pancakes for my aunt and French Toast for myself - specifically Apple Cinnamon pancakes and Challah French toast and the former once again proving the point that my aunt simply cannot and should not ever order pancakes as each disc was pleasantly golden but far too dense and largely lacking any semblance of apple or cinnamon flavor aside from the few small chunks of apples mixed into the batter.  Not one to fancy syrup but instead opting for powdered sugar or sugar on her cakes I think my aunt had anticipated cooked apples served overtop but instead was left high and (quite literally) dry for $7.50.For my part, particularly with the addition of the overpriced syrup (which they did not even provide me in the special ""Beauty's"" glass bottle,) I have to admit that the $7.50 Challah French Toast was the star of the morning with the dense eggy bread nicely saturated with vanilla tinged custard and seared to a golden tan.  Slightly crisp on the exterior and just a bit 'wet' in the middle there was nothing fancy about the toast - just a good rendition of a classic making me wonder if perhaps Beauty's is the sort of place where one should just stick to the script and order eggs and bacon...an answer I'll probably never know as I'd be very hard pressed to return."

Nothing spectacular for a brunch. 15 dollars for a sandwich and a side of potatoes that were cold. We politely asked for more water and the waiter pulled out a very unkind face and never came .

I ordered the pain dore (french toast) made on challah - egg on egg action with bacon. Delicious! Friends ordered pain dore with fruit and blueberry pancakes.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Certain restaurants in Montreal are what one would call institutions. As a local Montrealer, these are places that you should get to at some point because to miss them is to miss out on experiences that are part of what makes Montreal special when it comes to food. Schwartz's, Moishes (eventually in my case), Laurier BBQ before the Ramsey fiasco, St-Viateur and/or Fairmount bagels (depending on where you side on that debate but that's a story for another day), etc.... In the end, you may leave slightly underwhelmed because your experience couldn't possibly match up to the hype but regardless, they are places that you must experience for yourself.Beauty's is such a place. A staple of Montreal since 1942, they have been owned by the same family the whole time and have been serving up breakfast in Mile End ever since. Any day of the week you pass by, you will see a line-up outside. On this beautiful thanksgiving weekend, before heading to watch the Alouettes sadly get beat at Molson Stadium, I finally got my chance to visit Beauty's with some friends for a little late breakfast.Beauty's is known for their special - cream cheese, smoked salmon and onion on a bagel. However, I am not much of a fan of smoked salmon so I chose to go with the Beauty's basic - two eggs, home fries, one meat with a bagel. A simple dish but one that must be spot on if you are worth your salt as a breakfast place. Very good overall. The home fries in particular were quite delicious.To that, we originally ordered some latkes and I took a Classico Beauty's smoothie. However, they had run out of latkes by the way we got our order in. So just the smoothie would have to do. Strawberry, banana and orange juice - simple but classic. A nice thick consistency and very delicious. The perfect complement to a nice breakfast.Is it a earth shattering breakfast? Not exactly. But it is a Montreal landmark that serves a very good breakfast. The place looks exactly like what you think it would - a diner that has been going since 1942. It has a wonderful old fashion feel that I absolutely love - right down to the owner greeting you at the door and joking with you as you wait for your table. You may want something more unique or different for breakfast but that's not Beauty's and that's fine. They simply do a damn fine breakfast as they have been doing since 1942. For that reason alone, you need to check it out. I waited way too long. You don't have to make that same mistake.Cheers!"

BLT on rye. Well let me tell you, this was by far the BEST BLT I've ever had!!! 3 layers of juicy ripe tomatoes, stack of bacon and crisp layer (about 1 inch) lettuce.

The bagels are as good as you'd expect for a Jewish-run restaurant in Montreal - flawless.The pancakes are top notch, but I particularly like the normal ones best (rather than the blueberries ones). There's probably nothing wrong with the blueberry pancakes, but they just didn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations. I consider myself a Blueberry Expert, and I haven't found a food that can't be improved by stuffing it with blueberries. Unfortunately, these ones just didn't make it. Stick to the plain ones.Even with all these good things, the stand-out on the menu for me is their cookies-and-creme smoothie. Oh. My. G-d. It is amazing. I'm lucky Beauty's is on the other side of the mont from my home, or I would have gorged myself on it way too many times already.TLDR; Go and try the cookies-and-creme smoothie.

Beauty was there in the flesh to greet us when we came in, which is pretty cool. It was a January morning so very cold and we were happy to see that we wouldn't need to wait in line (though when we were leaving they were getting busier there was still no line.)It's not that the food isn't good, because it is. The service is very fast, though, and that's probably why the turnover is fast enough to keep people off the streets. We were seen almost immediately and brought hot coffee, which wasn't anything fancy but it was good. I decided to have the latkes with sour cream and apple sauce and he had the Mish-Mash, because when there's a trademarked omelette on the menu, it's called the Mish-Mash and it has hot dogs in it SOMEBODY has to order it. Our food was up very quickly. My latkes didn't come with anything beyond the condiments (which is fine since they're $6!) and the Mish-Mash came with a toasted sesame bagel and home fries. Everything was very good (hot dogs and salami in an omelette - who knew?) and everything together after tax and tip came in at under $30.

From the moment my family and I stepped into the establishment, we knew this was going to go downhill. We weren't greeted until I stared one of the servers down that she had no choice but to walk over and seat us. We were being rushed to order our food and when we weren't ready, our server, Ann Marie, sarcastically made a remark and walked away. Our food came out and it was so mediocre, I thought it was a joke. Flavorless and basically burnt. When we finished what we could, the check dropped and then the server's true colors came out. She hovered around the table as we were using the card reader and harassed us to give her a tip to the point where her voice was raised the entire diner went quiet. We thought explaining to her manager about our experience would help... NOPE. He screamed at my family and I about how his servers are busy and hard workers and held the door as he kicked us out. Not only was the server rude, hostile (that's the word she used to describe us), and inconsiderate, the food is NOT what people hype it up to be. NEVER AGAIN!!!"

Some people don't like icons, or at least what comes with icon status, i.e. mainly waiting in line to get in, and the occasional other imperfections (see other reviews) that come with running a wonderful place for many decades. And I don't think culinary creativity is the main event here, it's a diner, you either want that or you don't. Go to Beauty's when you want breakfast, done right, with a great family feel. There's a terrific ""kinda hip but not too self-consciously trying too hard"" vibe, really friendly, but of course very busy and a bit frenetic. Did I mention, it's a diner? They do what they do, well, and in our experience very consistently. It's one of our go-to spots when visiting Montreal.

Really, it was all food that I could have made myself in my own kitchen, except I was eating it in Beauty's in a diner booth with friends. I realize that this place is an institution and famous landmark of the city, but maybe it was overhyped when I went and thus I felt let down. I am not really sure what I was expecting. Maybe something exciting like a pin-up waitress on a roller skate and a delightful interaction with a charismatic mom/pop type of thing. Whatever half-baked imaginary picture I had in my head was not there and I was left sort of bored poking at my egg wishing I could have their ice cream that was unavailable."

The concept, the food, the charm, and most of all The Man behind it all, Mr. Hymie Sckolnick. He opened up the restaurant in 1942 and to this day, he still runs the restaurant at 91 years of age. You are first greeted at the door by a long ass line. If you feel any negativity about having to wait on said long ass line, the negativity soon evaporates once you are greeted at the front of the line by Hymie himself in his 91 year old glory. You'll be initially confused because he will greet you with a ""you're welcome"", only to realize that he means it as in ""You are welcome here."" And that is precisely the environment that Beauty's has achieved. The friendliness of the staff, the hominess of the cushy blue booths, and the I-could-eat-this-for-breakfast-every-day-of-my-life quality of food makes every patron feel welcome and serve as the reasons why people can't get enough of this place.  I would recommend anything and everything off of their menu, but especially implore you to order anything that includes bagels (freshly baked!) and/or challah (i.e. thick pieces of carbs that are doused in butter and then toasted and then glazed with more butter). You'd probably also regret not trying the Beauty's Special of lox + a ton of cream cheese + bagel.If you're a New Yorker, you will love this place because it's exactly the kind of authentic old-school, neighborhood diner that the amalgam of new faux-diner establishments try  to emulate."

If I were you, I'd go, just to get the chance to meet this person who has been working on the same spot for more than the last 70 years!  I also want to point out, that the place is immaculately clean.  We had dinner that night elsewhere, and remarked back to what an amazing feat it was that Beauty's was so clean given the huge crowds they serve.  Really impressive.A note about the star rating.  In a world where McDonalds gets 5-star ratings, I'm really tempted to give Beauty's 5 stars.  But  I'm not going in for star-inflation and I'm sticking by the guidelines: this is a really solid 4-star place.  The food is great, the prices are good (especially for this town), we both had breakfast for about $30.  Super fancy? no.  Super hip or upscale?  no.  Great food, great service, inexpensive, fun atmosphere?  Yes!Bottom line, go there for breakfast, you won't be disappointed.  Be sure to say hello to Hymie!"

The decor of the place takes you back to the 50's, so does the menu; the rushed and stressed atmosphere and the prices on said menu reminds you you're definitely in 2014.We had the superbeauty2 (eggs, pancakes, sausages, bacon and potatoes) with a fresh orange juice and the Nova omelette (salmon, pepper and onions) with bagels and a chocolate milkshake. The food had nothing wow about it. It's all very comfy and easy, nothing you couldn't make yourself in your kitchen even without any cooking talent. But you have the pleasure of it being done for you as if like us you just didn't feel like cooking this morning. The orange juice was good and fresh as announced (it's so rarely the case I had to point it out) and the milkshake was just delicious.Do not expect to be able to take your time and enjoy your brunch, this is a place where you come, eat and go (and pay), no time to waste."

That's the owner!""Does it offer anything revolutionary and different? No. What Beauty's does offer is standard diner food done RIGHT. Quite simply, it tastes good! Everything comes hot, tastes fresh, and when you're done eating, you realize you are completely satisfied. As standard diner etiquette goes, the waitresses are not particularly nice, but rather all business. The bagels you get with your meal are all right, but nothing special. Just a nice touch.Beauty's offers fruit smoothies that are pretty good, but the main star of their beverage world is definitely the milkshake. I brilliantly ordered a chocolate milkshake, which turned out to be the best decision I made that day. It was phenomenal. I've never even used the word 'phenomenal' before, but that's what it was. Chocolaty, sweet, and too easily drinkable (this is NOT a thick milkshake, if that's what you're after), it was definitely the highlight of my meal. I had to cut off my mooching friend from stealing any more.

This served as entertainment as well since you could clearly see how the servers and the cooks interact (and let me tell you, it. is. tense.) We ordered a cookies and creme smoothie (never too early for one of these bad boys), french toast, and a Beauty's 2. The smoothie was huge, don't expect to finish your breakfast after this. The french toast was a bit greasy and since it;s made with challah bread, it's pretty rich.

At three Canadian bucks, the orange better have been squeezed by Gisele Bundchen's asscheeks.The best part of the meal was, not surprisingly, the bagel. I've heard so much about Montreal's bagels and my skepticism as a New Yorker was definitely misguided and immediately debunked. The bagels are GREAT. They're small, almost half the size of a NYC bagel, but the density is there. I'm not claiming Beautys bagels to be the best, but it definitely set the bar high.Would I go back to Superbeautys when i'm in town? Probably not.

Really warm, smiley and genuine and our food literally arrived in minutes. Second reason was the melt. Oh my word! They use challah bread (forgive me if I spelled it wrong) and we had a melt with egg, bacon and cheese. It was so simple and SO delicious! It literally melts in your mouth! The melt comes with a choice of meats and our waitress said it's even better with salami. That bread is so good! I heard their French toast is made with the same bread so that's my next order!

/user_details?userid=HgwXAwj03Ec-ROvvG_laLg,Billy W.,"Centerport, NY",4 star rating,"Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain show. He was eating a bagel with lox and i had to try it. I was not disappointed. Very fresh and lox was delicious. Fresh squeezed orange juice too. My boyfriend had their omlette special mishmash. If you like salami and hotdogs in your morning omlette you will love it.  Gave it four stars because of the long wait for the food. Others that came in after us received their food first, but dont let this stop you from trying this place when in Montreal."

What fun we had with our waiter and the visit to our table by Hymie the owner. A lovely gentleman who clearly loves his work. The Nova lox plate was a great way to start the day, and the omelettes were light without the grease of typical greasy spoons."

Everyone was very friendly and the Mac and cheese was to excellent! I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Montreal.
/user_details?userid=P9hbcVoZIPKF4gV8KH427A,Aaliyah P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Close proximity to our apt and we arrived at the perfect time about 5 min after we sat down there was a huge rush (we arrived around 11:15 am Saturday morning for brunch) Pretty solid breakfast line up my only gripe is that everything is a la carte- Most places offer a side with sandwiches and egg dishes. We did the French toast and tuna melt, side of home fries and one cookies and cream shake to go. Yes the shakes are as good as everyone says they are. French toast was made with freshly bake challah bread but came with sesame seeds ... interesting twist.. Id probabaly come back but i wouldnt rush to do so there are so many brunch places on Rue Mont Royal"
/user_details?userid=2WGo0LWJsTjd_XjyLenBCQ,Sam M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"My friends and I went to Beauty's and after reading the yelp reviews were excited about this place.   We went during the week and just after the big storm so we found the place to be quiet which was a nice surprize because I've heard the line ups are long.  We were not to be disappointed.  The service was friendly and quick.  Moreover, the food-the pancakes and the challah bread were excellent.  The coffee was filled up regularly too.  Bonus.  Would go again and again."

/user_details?userid=VDlgRucqqqoSc3UDglEaLA,Slate H.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Tourists. Hipsters. Beauty's is required as a Montreal icon. So I go as required and wait patiently in a never ending line. The food is standard fare-- but the standard fare is exceptional. Despite my cynicism--I love the bagels --and the pancakes. The Super Beauty Two is the most direct route to excess--pancakes, eggs, sausage, potato, bacon and bagels...ok I was a vegan until I was overwhelmed with the scent of animal fat. So fat satiated, I waddled out. It was worth it."

/user_details?userid=1pJmyex-C3Rsa-hsXaWOXQ,Ian M.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,Classic restaurant in the heart of the plateau. Take a step back in time when you walk through the doors. Service and food come together for the perfect meal. Add a classic milkshake for the grand finale.
/user_details?userid=uwiJ-U5NX3hvAWHPo2NSOQ,Mama Z.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"Solid, nice and clean.  Great wait staff= service with a smile...this is a typical diner, with solid food.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.  I did NOT have a smoothie or shake, so perhaps I short changed myself! :-)"
/user_details?userid=7bAnU8PIEmAV_tUeaIdCaw,Ennie L.,"San Mateo, CA",2 star rating,"This is a classic breakfast resto in Montreal, also a tourist stop. I had an egg sandwich on pumpernickel, it came with no sides. The wait is very long and frankly I think L'avenue has much better brunch for its value."
/user_details?userid=goVg-XsCx_xzF0UIl3mYIw,Mon C.,"Quincy, MA",3 star rating,"Went to Beauty's based on the other reviews. But I would say it's just a typical diner, nothing too exciting. It was fine, but not sure if I would say it's a must visit if you're in Montreal. It's just average."
/user_details?userid=Mjeg719uG0d5KqEP9VXW1A,Julien M.,"Meillonnas, France",2 star rating,"Food was ok, however very basic - no fruit on the side, only a single side with most dishes. Not worth the queue, the place is clearly over hyped."
/user_details?userid=pv86km6DIZTYUAJLxPvNxA,D D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place deserves a 5 for the filling comfort food breakfast, but most importantly the warm greeting from owner Hymi Sckolnick (92 years old!)... two days in a row! The portions are huge and everything was very tasty and has a home cooked feel.The home fries are amazing and the Superbeauty 2 breakfast meal is more than enough to share. Bagels from St. Viateur bakery are obviously amazing. Definitely a cool, iconic place to enjoy breakfast and friendly staff."

/user_details?userid=xAUgRGjLxyel0b8Ao--1aA,Louis C.,"Littleton, CO",5 star rating,Excellent breakfast. Definitely worth the wait. Had the French Toast and it was delicious.  Service was outstanding.  I'll be back.
/user_details?userid=gkJbENqCqwUF56-3pzcHiA,Michael D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"First time at this Montreal land mark. Went on a Saturday around noon so it had a lineup out the door as anticipated, though it moved quickly. The owner Hymie was there to host and seat tables, making sure the restaurant was moving efficiently. Nice to see him still so involved, interacting with guests. Had the classic smoked salmon bagel with tomato and onion, montreal bagel was great, I have a bias towards my Nova Scotia smoked salmon, but overall a very tasting sandwich. Fresh fruit and coffee also very good. Well priced and great atmosphere with multiple generations of the family in house to serve the masses for breakfast. Must go to experience!"
