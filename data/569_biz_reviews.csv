/user_details?userid=79FjYkc1wEaCxeutX-pQgA,kim g.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,The  dumplings were super fresh tasting and flavorful. I was tempered to get a 2nd order but wanted to save room for others options. The mac & cheese was divine. Again very flavorful with a creamy bechemel sauce as the base. I didn't want it to end. American hip hop was Playing to create the vibe and the front two tables are great when it's warm to have that outdoor element. Overall I was pleasantly surprised! Give it a try!

/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"1$ oysters yay! Besides that nay!Decided to order a bunch of oysters because the price is right so why the heck not. The person who Shucked them is a pro A+. I will be back just for oysters without a doubt.Now let's get in to the actual menu, the shrimp tempura is your basic shrimp tempura these however were heavily battered and extremely greasy, the dipping sauce wasn't good either reminded me of a milky soya sauce that should be changed asap. Then there was the beef tattaki which was bland and missing salt. The grilled octopus salad was meh and the lamb ravioli was actually just buttery dumplings with a ginger sauce they were ok but wouldn't order it again, and last but not least the mini burgers they were way over cooked and bland, needs a pickle and some mayo.The place is beyond expensive after being handed a 200 $ bill i just laughed to myself there's way better places that this money could of been blown this place not so much. Strictly a oyster spot, and a drink spot other then that it's a pass."
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",3 star rating,I was so excited as this was my first choice for their Lobster and Gravy Poutine with Homemade Tater toys. When I had arrived they were fully booked with reservations for the evening. I was not happy with the price and portion of the poutine. It came with very little lobster and 5 homemade tater tots. It tasted amazingly though. As well when they are cooking it does smell a bit fishy throughout the night with the seafood. But with a small place that is to be expected. Throughout the night the service wasn't that great as often I needed water throughout the meal. There is also only one bathroom that is shared between men and woman. So you are left waiting if it's busy. Overall good tasting food but too small of a portion and pricey. I could also suggest more visits to the table by the waitstaff it's a small place and there were many staff to help.

We went for the 1$ oysters and I have to say the oysters were meaty and tasty. Very worth it. Since we were a small group we got to try many different plates. However the tapas were a bit disappointing. We had the salmon belly. The lamb dumplings. The salmon tartar which everybody says is amazing in their reviews - I personally thought it was just o.k. We also had the Mac and cheese cochon , the crab bites. And we had the filet mignon poutine which our waiter said was his favorite. I didn't find anything special about it at all. And the tapas are quite pricy!!All tapas were pretty boring except the salmon belly which was phenomenal!!! Our waiter was extremely polite and super friendly. The service was good. I would only go back for 1$ oysters and the salmon belly.  we also tried the churros for desert and they were very good although not the best I've had - the chef was not very generous with the dulce de lèche sauce. I had to ask twice to bring me more. For 3 people the bill came out to 240$ including tip which included a bottle of wine and 2 beers."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Open on Mondays serving $1 oysters, La Betise and I had a high likelihood of being friends. It's a small casual room on St Hubert below Bellechase with a few tables outside and a single booth in the back. The oysters were fresh and tasty, not exceptional but not problematic at all. We shared an inexpensive and very tasty bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (and then another one) while we dug into guacamole (super tasty but seemed like a mix of fresh and stale nachos on the plate;) sausage mac and cheese with quail egg (amazing flavours. so. so. good.;) General Tao poutine (crispy, yummy;) pork belly (amazing) and a beef tartare I didn't try but my friends enjoyed. Fun, quick, friendly service that seemed to be in close communication with the nice group of people working in the small open kitchen together. Nothing fancy in the room or tables but surprisingly good food and a nice experience. Will be back!"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Recently discovered this awesome 5 a 7 hot spot located on st hubert street. This resto is a cozy small place which is great for grabbing drinks with friends and serves up some awesome cocktails...their sangria's are out of this world. Service is warm and super friendly. The resto offers incredible tapas and awesome table d'hote. They are known for their Mouth-watering salmon tartare which truly lived up to its expectations.... Truly the best in the city. Oyster dish is also awesome. Would also recommend their crab bite dish..sensational! Last but not least I recommend leaving some room for their desserts...fried dough covered with milk chocolate and served with vanilla ice cream!
/user_details?userid=cfHjmoP39vzf6-uw0uNx1A,Jenny L.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"I loved the mojito with fresh strawberry and lichee! We ordered the octopus salad, the crab bites on tortilla, the pork belly, the frog legs and the macaroni and cheese with duck asian style. Although the octopus salad was a bit too salty, the flavours and textures were very good. The crab on tortilla were good, but needed some acidity to balance the creaminess. The pork belly was just amazing! It melted in my mouth and the seasoning was perfect! The frog legs were bland and, therefore, very disappointing. The macaroni and cheese was served last. It was good, but we were almost full so it was way too rich for us. The service was very good and the staff is friendly. However, the prices are slightly expensive for the neighborhood. For eg, 12$ for the mojito before tax and tips.  Overall, I would still recommend the restaurant for their drinks and pork belly dish."
/user_details?userid=YL5rxfeCtIeFiOkx1Dftvg,Carolili003 ..,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We found this restaurant on BlogMTL for the $1 oyster and when we arrived, the waitress asked us if we have reservation, when we told her we did not make reservation, she told us the place is booked for all night and turned us down. Oddly, we went on OpenTable and found a bar table for three at 20:15 which was about 45 minutes later. We showed our reservation to the waiter and the waitress and then they still turned us down saying they cannot give us the bar table at 20:15. We find it stupidly funny and nonsense because we made a reservation and they wouldn't honour it. I don't recommend this place at all, and will no longer want to explore their food, as they didn't welcome my business at all!!"
/user_details?userid=oDq7wWXkse6e5GMYuyoZeQ,Nayiri T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We ordered 8 tapas for 4 girls like the waitor suggested. It was way too much. 6 wouldve been perfect. So, the food started off really yummy - crab bites, beef filet mignon, salmon and octopus salad (if im not mistaken). Then went downhill with the frog legs, chicken bites and mac n cheese. It wasnt so bad but the first 4, i loved! Service is great and staff is super friendly."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this restaurant! I've been here maybe 3 times and loved my experience each time. Is it far from me? Yes. Is it usually winter that I go for MTL a Table or for PoutineWeek? Yes. But it's so good. I've tried many things, from the lobster mac n cheese poutine to the salmon tartare and desserts, all is delicious from what I can remember."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Service: The service is simply great. The waitress was really nice, always smiling and considerate. She also knows the menu really well and was able to answer every question we had. She also check often on us to see if everything was okay.Score: 5/5Food: I tried almost everything on the menu. Even though I found some plate a bit disapointing such as the lobster mac&cheese, most of the dishes were really good. The classic salmon tartare is simply amazing, as well as the filet mignon poutine. The General Tao poutine was a bit too sweet for me, but it was still good. I also really enjoyed the fried calamari. The dish came with two sauces: spicy mayo and curry mayo, both of them were good. Also, my friend is allergic to seafood, and he did not have an allergic reaction, which demonstrates the the kitchen is really careful. Score: 4.5/5Drinks: La Betise has a quite good selection of drinks. I tried the Christmas Mojito, which is basically a mojito with strawberries and other fruits, it was really good. The barmaid can also do drinks that are not on the menu, as long as she knows how to do it. That night, the barmaid had a really extensive knowledge on drinks so we did not have any problem. Score: 5/5Ambiance: The ambiance is really nice. They usually put some old school rap in the background, and they have a big screen inside on which you can watch hockey games. When it gets darker, the waitress put candles on the tables, which gives a perfect athmosphere for a date. But I do agree that candles and hockey games are not necessary a good match.Score: 4.5/5Dish you MUST order: classic salmon tartare"
/user_details?userid=Fqe0t4Yg6QJ_p44_wsmPzg,French C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Tapas bar with an Asian twist... Love it! General Tao's Poutine is a must try.Dynamic staff and very accommodating owner. The location is small but good enough to sit a group of 20-25 at the same table If you are looking for a private party.Reservation is recommended on weekends.
/user_details?userid=mI4JiIhxbL_oNC6Dkd7pZg,Clea C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We went all Asian on the night at La Bêtise. We chose to go on $1 oyster Monday, and bought the tasting menu coupon on one of the deal sites. In the end we paid around $50 per person for drinks, dozen of oysters and a crazy amount of food. We were almost too full to move at the end of the night.For the oysters, we got Raspberry Point for the night. It was really delicious and if we didn't have the tasting menu coming, we might have just sat there and go through dozens of oysters.The cocktails were not strong, but very tasty. And the nice presentation just lifted our spirits.The food at La Bêtise is Asian fusion. My favorites out of the tasting menu are definitely the crab bites and salmon tartare.The crab bites combined a whole bunch of ingredients in one bite and is just a burst of flavor in the mouth. For the salmon tartare, it has avocado and sauce in the bottom to enhance the experience.I was really looking forward to the General Tao poutine. But when we got to that point, everyone was simply too full to enjoy the taste..."
/user_details?userid=p5AXKTixc9NleUnSizZJcg,Daniel L.,"Mount Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"My friends gave me great reviews about this place, and I really enjoy tapas, so I was looking forward to try out their menu. We went there for one my friend's birthday, and they were nice enough to keep the cake I brought in the fridge. It's a rather small place, but the ambiance is nice, the staff is friendly and I enjoyed the music.We ordered a bunch of tapas. My favorites would be the the classic salmon tartar (la betise) and the fish tacos. I really enjoyed the tartar la betise, and the taste reminded me of spicy salmon sushi. I think I would have enjoyed more if instead of deep-fried chips, they were served with nori. I was looking forward to try their octopus salad, but they were out. Other than that, I found that the other meals were ok.As for the service, it was a bit weird. We got our tapas at various moments instead of all together, and since we were all sharing, it made us wait for the rest of the plates to come. Also, our bills were mixed up and took time to come. Price wise, if you split the bill other peeps, you can probably get of taste of 8-10 plates for around 35$, which is good.Overall, it is a nice place, and I probably would go again, but in a smaller group for better service."

Refreshing cocktail: Hendricks Green apple & cucumber. And for dessert, the fried Bueno, no doubt!A good option is taking the degustation menu, it's totally worth it."

Anyway the burgers were super hot and served with a yummy house mayo. I thought about asking for ketchup for both my apps but there was really no need. Friendly service, large drink selection and as I said, hot food. Great joint."

I loved it. Very creative and delicious. The atmosphere is chill and the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, too. I think it would be a great place for a date."
/user_details?userid=sAqu1ueoTR-eK8rQiFkO0w,Carrie T.,"Martinez, CA",5 star rating,"Salmon tartare was very good. Their dishes overall had great flavors. What makes them from a 4 to 5 stars is their hospitality.  When we told him we were Tourists from San Francisco, they showed us where to go locally and even drew a map and poured us free Jamesons to show us the Montreal way! Will definitely go back!!"
/user_details?userid=jImKbs4In8xg5c73Gb0NTQ,Eric C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The lobster and bacon macpoutine (poutine week) was terribly bad; absolutely no lobster nor bacon taste, and no sauce!... Wasn' t even a poutine! There were plenty of empty tables (counted 4+) but we were told all were reserved so we decided to order to go, but there's not even room to stand."
/user_details?userid=X-0nbZetk3Q0fwSshR901w,Fancy A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is awesome!  Everything on the menu is delicious.  My favorite is the Salmon Tartare, but all of their tapas are just as scrumptious! Nice, understated decor and good smooth ambiance with super nice and curteous staff.  I'm thrilled this place is just a hop and a skip away from my house, makes it easier to keep coming back."
