The lobster bisque, calamari, and steak were great. All of the courses were pretty good. The way the food was presented was quirky which I liked. The dessert came with cotton candy and candy bags hanging from a tree which was cute. I would definitely come back here when visiting Montreal again."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Wow!  I finally got the chance to dine at this fabulous restaurant and loved loved it!!  I had the privelge of being invited to a special 8 course menu for 75$  and it was worthy every penny.  Dinning at this Top MTL resto is really a foodie's dream come true!  Their new location located on rue de la montagne is super modern and very classy!  They have a gorgeous open kitchen and you can easily watch the Master Chef at work!  Foodwise-absolutely delicious and unique.This is no ordinary service. Think of it as a theatrical dining experience - beautifully plated dishes all packed with unique delicious flavors and excellent service.  Yes I was lucky enough to be invited to a reduced price menu but I would have paid the full price of 125$ per person as it is so worth it!. I definately recommend to try this out at least once if you can!  It's definately a TOP  foodie dining experience. Tried their famous lobster capuccino and wow! Everything we had was amazing!  We also got the chance to meet and take picture with Chef Jerome Ferrer!  Such a down to earth fellow!  If one day I win the lottery I'll be dining here on a monthly basis!  Lol
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We came for my birthday dinner. We reserved at 8pm. Arrived at 8 and waited in the lounge. We got seated at 9 pm. it's the MTL a table event. So I am guessing waiting one hour is not a regular routine? I never had a dinner this late. Thank God I ate some snack after work or I would be hungry to death. The whole experience was full of surprises. For us finishing dinner at 11:30 pm was a very exhausting experience,especially on a weekday. At the end we were yawning a lot. But still we were so satisfied with food. The menu said 7 courses(83$), but we only received six beforehand we inserted card to the machine. Then I asked about the 7th course. The last dish was a bag of take-home candy. I don't want to describe all the dishes to spoil the surprises for you. In a nut shell, I like all the dishes. Only the oyster was a bit fishy. It's my fifth time with Europea but first time to try this new location. I really need to verify the usual waiting time and be prepared. The surprises and fanciness were upgraded for sure, just the waiting time was abnormal for us."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If you are a fan of perfectly executed multi-course meals, complete with gimmicks and little magic tricks, then this is the place for you. Dining is part of the experience, but certainly not the reason you go here. You go here for a nearly 3 hour meal/show put on by the dedicated waitstaff and sommeliers. There are a lot of elements to the meal with separate ornate services of food and beverage, each with their own separate presentations. Make no mistake about it. You will be dinged REALLY hard in the pocketbook here. They will push the wine pairing option until you feel foolish saying no. There are two options at 75$/person or 150$/person. Both options will get you 4 small pours of various wines/bubbly. My wife and I took the 75$ option, therefore spending 150$ on wine. Adding the 4 mini pours of wine together, I doubt the total exceeds one standard bottle of wine... maybe by a fraction, but no more. Obviously, we should have just ordered a regular bottle of wine and saved ourselves a bunch of money. That said, we fell prey to the dog and pony show which is undoubtedly essential to the restaurant's ability to pay rent on the same block as the Bell Centre. While I believe you can go a la carte, most people choose one of 2 tasting menus. I think ours was the more moderately priced one at 95$/person. The evening starts by having the guests seated in the lounge. It strongly appears that this is their policy whether or not the table is ready. They want you ordering a cocktail, and who wouldn't when the price of said beverage hovers around the 20$ mark. They give you some dried vegetable chips or something akin to that. Magically, after the cocktail is ordered, they announce that the table is ready. (Pssst....hey guys, I would have ordered a drink anyways)The meal starts with some sort of fake tree spewing dry ice. I still don't understand why. Something about a towel to wipe my hands? The tree branches hold two pieces of baked goods that you dip in an off beige sauce. It was pretty tasty.Then comes an amuse bouche of dried fish and some sort of beef balls. Again pretty tasty.Out comes another box with another towel and a note from the chef.Next up, you've got a lobster cappuccino. Basically it's glorified clam chowder with a piece of lobster at the bottom. Two sips and you're done.They do serve delicious croissants and bread with butter which we filled up on. Don't ask me what a croissant is doing at a dinner service, but who am I to argue with a breakfast treat this well prepared?My wife had some sort of lobster tisane and dish that included a broth prepared in a bubbling multi-layered glass science experiment, the type you didn't understand properly in high school, because...who cares. It tasted weird according to m'lady.I had some foie gras which was decent and served in 3 variationsThen comes the oyster show. They invite you to put on these goggles and watch a video of an oyster fisherman. Ok...I'll bite. When the video is over, you have a dish of salt water with inedible brown rocks (don't mistake these or you will be visiting the dentist), and ONE oyster. Yeah, they put some stuff in the oyster, but guess what...it tasted like an oyster. Maybe across the street at Old Orchard, they can show you a video of a chicken farm and then present you with a single chicken wing. For our mains, my wife had this intricate fish dish, while I had the beef which was essentially 3 ounces of filet, about a tablespoon of tartare (served on a giant rock), and literally a single TEASPOON of braised brisket that had undergone some mythical and magical treatment earlier in the afternoon (i.e. they cooked it) At this point, they give you a piece of white paper and a paintbrush with water to dip. They tell you to paint. Essentially, another note from the chef is revealed. They are basically telling you that a roasted marshmallow in forthcoming. Each diner gets one marshmallow to cook over a gas flame. It was good. The part I really liked was the chocolate and cream filled cigar which accompanied the dessert.They finish the meal with a mountain of maple cotton candy and a clay pot that you smash with an actual hammer to get to some honeycomb toffee chunks like the inside of a Crunchy bar. Together with the cotton candy, I really think they must have a side deal with a dental clinic. What am I, 11 years old? For the fifth dessert, they serve some sort of pretty plated arrangement which i think tasted like blueberry. As a nice touch, when you are paying the bill, they give you a loaf of orange bread ""for breakfast tomorrow"" in a Jerome Ferrer bag. A couple of tasting menus, 2 ill advised wine pairings, and a couple of cocktails. Tax and tip.....over 500$. The orange loaf the next morning was great. Also, we did have fun throughout. Ultimately, however, this place is overpriced, touristy, and the type of thing that I really only need to do once in my life, if that."
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",3 star rating,Came here for a lunch meeting and let me tell you it's way to overpriced and over rated.... Service is horrible! Finally cought the waiters attention after 10min to Ask for some sparkling water we got it 5 min later and we were ready to order and wanted a quick bite to eat It took us like 25-35 min wait to get just our water and over an hour for a tiny little salad with barely anything in it. -.- the worst part is the waiter came to refill the sparkling water by adding tap water .... nooooo you don't do that.... I expressed to him that it was a big no no to mix sparkling and tap in the same glass and if he wanted to bring tap water he had to bring separate glasses he didn't care and repeated the same offence twice. I was furious! Food: it was pretty good ! Sea bass was amazing and tender .. I really enjoyed it and the salad was fresh but a bit overpriced for its portionHowever the service is very important and it was horrible and dreadfully long ! I decided not to tip as the waiter really didn't care whatsoever. He was mad that we didn't tip.. I'm like you want a tip? I'll give you a tip .... Be more friendly to your customers and actually act like you care maybe it'll change the outcome of the way people tip!

With only a weekend to spare in Montreal, we decided that a 3.5 hour meal with Jerome Ferrer would be the best way to spend an evening.The experience was immersive, involving touch, smell, and sight - highlights were:- the smell of active charcoal burning under our lobster tails, evoking beachside grilling- taking a fishing trip with Jerome Ferrer with Oculus goggles paired with an oyster dish- a chocolate rolled cigar and a shot of whiskey infused chocolate- the whimsical colors of a maple-flavored cotton candy tree and gin cocktail (as the server shakes up your cocktails, you listen to bongo drum beats)- the lobster cappuccino (his signature!)- a delicate white fish steamed on a bed of citrus fruits and paired with an egg-based tarragon sauvignon sauceJerome Ferrer and his team of chefs and servers deliver a dining experience that engages all five of your senses - recommend if you're looking for something memorable, different, and of course, delicious."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As ever, the food and service at Europea was amazing. I started with a Maryland crab-cake  that was almost as satisfying as Baltimore's finest. The flavour and texture of the lump crabmeat was so rewarding after years of having eaten crab-flavoured sawdust at so many other restaurants. My friend's squash soup was both pretty and tasty.We both then chose the Lamb shoulder confit - a perfect cylinder of fragrant lamb bathed in a flavourful brown gravy and surrounded by tender white salsify. Atop the lamb - a  puree of (orange) peppers which had the perfect intensity to balance the savouriness of the lamb.During the meal we were offered yummy buttery croissants and other breads. All were delicious but the butteriness of the croissants had us searching for a napkin - none of which were to be found. We eyed the fabric sofas upon which we were seated but opted to keep it classy. If there was a perfect time to have a pocket square at the ready it would have been then; instead we dined with buttery fingers.Desert was the perfect culmination of this wonderful luncheon. We both had their cheesecake then nibbled on the assorted little pastries. Europea's lunch menu is online; bookmark it."

Let's just say, our experience was so amazing that we would do a day trip (from Buffalo) to eat here.If I could leave 6 stars I would. Jérôme Ferrer was one of the best meals I've experienced in my lifetime. We went with the 12 course Experience. Definitely worth the price! When signing up for this option, you are signing up for not only for superb food but a superb performance. Our experience started with enjoying two martinis along with complimentary truffle Parmesan popcorn in the lounge area. From there, our bartender walked us to our table where our experience began. Our 12 courses also included an interactive VR journey to where our oysters were caught, along with an audio musical soundtrack to the presentation of one of dessert courses. The server was completely unbelievable, even gifting me one of the chefs cookbooks as a birthday gift.What really put our meal over the top was upon looking into the open kitchen. One of the servers noticed me and my girlfriend intrigued with the kitchen. He insisted on giving us a tour, allowing us to even shake hands with the chef. This has never happened to us and really left us with an unforgettable experience. This restaurant made you feel special. Between meeting the chef, eating the superb food, watching the show that came with each course, and the amazing hospitality, it will leave you wanting more, even after sitting down for a 3.5 hour meal. We will definitely be back soon and look forward to doing it all over again."

But before move , it used to have individual orders , now there is only tasting menu , I hope could keep at least some individual orders for more options . 2nd , now the valet parking is super hard , de la montagne is a very busy street so if you flash and park there is quiet impossible to make a such thing . You will block the street and Ppl behind your card . Should find some other place or just give the client place where your valet are and when client finishes meal give a pass to garb . I think it will be better"

Not to spoil, with all the surprises, it was more like a nine-course meal!!!As for the food, everything was amazing and sort of... whimsical! It is definitely an experience you gotta try once! Like they say, you eat with the eyes. I won't give too much details as the food tastes just so yummy when you're surprised (PS. I have attached photos with no description for those who have a need to know what they are eating prior).The service was impeccable and courteous. The handwritten note by the chef was a really nice touch!TIP. I know it's hard but TRY not to look at the other table. Be delighted by the surprises. Enjoy!Oh and did I mention pre-dessert? :P"
/user_details?userid=yp0aBcdHbc9cVyrpENNSqQ,Fangfei L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"(Vegetarian Review)As I'm on a personal mission to try every vegetarian tasting menu, I had to stop by Europea when I was in Montreal. We made reservations as a group of 6 and were seated promptly. I thought the meal was reasonably priced (especially compared to SF / NY) for a tasting menu, and there was more than enough food for everyone.Pros(+) Interesting displays: Everything was very unique at the restaurant including the cotton candy tree and goat cheese lollipops. It was definitely a fun experience for the group(+) Vegetarian option: I appreciated having a vegetarian option, and I saw that there was a vegan tasting on the menu as well(+) Relatively inexpensive compared to other tastings(+) Great service ***We also ran into the Europea Mobile food truck the next day which was also good and has more fast-food-esque options. Would recommend trying both!"
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"+.5 for serviceNumber 1 restaurant in Canada. Number 24 restaurant in the world (or something like that). A final bill for 5 that's equivalent to a week's paycheque for many people. That's basically Europea in a nutshell.I was one of the first people to try their new location, which was a lot closer to the central station. The place was extremely open concept with high ceilings. I don't want to explain/spoil too much about the restaurant concept, but there's uniqueness throughout that make the price you pay worth it.Some highlights included the lobster tea, ""sea bed myths and legends"", ""bounty of the land"", and the 3-course dessert. I don't wanna explain too much more of what they really are as it will ruin the surprise, but definitely consider ordering items that have any lobster (tea, cappuccino, or bisque) or calamari.I did take away 1 star for how the restaurant is laid out. If you end up getting a corner table (far right area on the main floor), you will have a lack of lighting. Unfortunately my group did get that table, and the lighting paled compared to other sections of the restaurant.Service is tremendous. Like, really tremendous. Probably one of the best services I've ever had in a restaurant, especially given its high standing. I'm not one to judge whether the ""#1 restaurant in Canada"" claim holds water, but I'm confident in saying it's up there in ""expensive restaurants that I would recommend everyone to try once""."
/user_details?userid=qdU1O2_ERYJlk6zAlR5kkw,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Great experience here for a birthday dinner during a long weekend in Montreal. My boyfriend and I both got the signature tasting menu, which was a steal for $130 CAD. There are 10 courses listed, but we also received several amuse bouches (I think at least 4) and an extra dessert .Presentation of everything was fantastic, as many others have noted. I loved how many of the dishes were slightly interactive, such as having to smash open the clay pot that the veal was braised in or having a smoked salmon amuse literally being served inside smoke.Service was also lovely, a stark contrast to another dinner that we'd had a few nights prior. However, will note that the pacing of the meal was quite leisurely (think our dinner took over 3 hours - I've had 20 course meals take that long), so don't come here if you're in a rush.Only ding is that I wish some of the flavor and preparation of the dishes was able to match the high caliber of presentation. While everything was impeccably prepared, the actual taste of a majority of the dishes just didn't have that same wow factor. Also - must try the sortilege cocktail! It was so yummy, and came with a piece of maple candy that slowly melted as you sipped on the drink as well."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here as a large group for a corporate dinner and everyone loved it. The decor is elegant yet cozy and not pretentious, the staff is extremely professional and accommodating, each of them was so friendly from the moment they greeted us at the door to when we left , very strong customer service. The prices here are not cheap but you are paying for the whole experience and a very unique meal prepared with skill detail and care. Definitely a special occasion restaurant but you will have a very unique and delicious dining experience. We had a multi course tasting menu surf & Turf , including oysters , crab claw and crab cake , steak , beef tartare , lobster cappucino, amazing bread selection , dessert and more. Each course was beautifully presented and was so flavourful and unique. The steak was so tasty and juicy and the crab cake was so fresh and full of flavour as well (definitely two of my favourites , as well as the lobster cappuccino). Tip , don't skip the bread when they come around with the basket, it was phenomenal (just try it you'll see !). The desserts were whimsical and fun , we had cotton candy , cinnamon beignet, and a really fun chocolate cigar that looked so real that when I showed people the photo they couldn't believe it was made of chocolate and cream filling. We also got to go to the kitchen and meet the chef which was fun, he was so friendly and welcoming and the kitchen was spotless and ran so smoothly , you can see how attentive they are on the details. Hands down one of the best restaurants in montreal."
/user_details?userid=LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,Francis T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This review is for the lunchboxes, and not the restaurant, which is next door. You can get lunchboxes to go from predetermined dishes throughout the week. I had a club sandwich and poutine.The good: The food is terrific! The choices of plates and nice and fancy (even their poutine was fancy). The boxes comes with utensils and napkins. Boxes also comes with a small desert. Felt full all day (even skipped dinner because l was too full). The bad: lt is pricey. Desert was dry and tasteless. Can be confused between lunchbox and restaurant doors. You can wait a while for your meal to be ready.In the end, if you have $20 to spend on a lunch, this is a strong suggestion."

/user_details?userid=7eXChTEowyi3L9W3X3-Obw,Cecile X.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"EUROPEA was my favorite French restaurant in Montreal. I used to go there a lot when they were in the old location, and I really liked the dishes they used to have. The fois gras, the lobster cappuccino, the steak, the cheese lollipop, the scallop risotto.... They were so special and tasty.However, I went to the new location for lunch a couple days ago, it really disappointed me. The price went down, the quality of dishes went down as well.We had fois gras, scallops and braised beef. The fois gras wasn't as good as the old one, the scallop was tasteless, the braised beef was horrible, which was dry, boring and I couldn't even finish. I asked the waiter why they changed the lunch menu, he told me that some customers told them: former lunch dishes take a lot of time to wait, so they make something faster now. I understand that, but I don't think 35 dollars for dishes like that is worth. I'd rather spend more money and more time to have a decent dish, not something cheap like a group meal (especially the braised beef).Also, the service wasn't as warm as before, there were just a few waiters there, sometimes you can't even get the attention from them.I know my comment can't changed anything, but I hope the restaurant could consider my advise. PLEASE DON'T MAKE CHEAP DISHES like that, people go there don't mind to spending extra 25 dollars or even more dollars for something decent. Btw, I didn't try the dinner menu, hope they're better than lunch."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I had high hopes going in to Europea for a group dinner based on other reviews but was overall disappointed with the evening. The highlight of the restaurant is the service, which is 5 star all the way.  Attentive, friendly, warm and personal.  I found the decor to be a bit tired and in need of a refresh.  It looked like cutting edge resto decor from the late 1990s. The food, with a few exceptions, was just ok.  Multiple appetizers, most of which I found quite bland, except for the lobster cappuccino which was delicious, and the calamari, which was also excellent.  I had the halibut as my main which I also found lacked flavour and was overwhelmed by an overly sweet coconut sauce.  The presentation of the dishes would have been cutting edge about 10 years ago but felt tired to me. Unfortunately I didn't get to stay for dessert as I got called into work.  My friends who stayed did rave about them, so perhaps I would have given this a four star if I'd had the chance to try them. Overall it wasn't bad, but for the price point I think there are more exciting tasting menus in Montreal right now for the same money."

They might be small dishes but you appreciate the taste so much more! And by the end of 10 dishes I couldn't eat anymore! The service is EXCELLENT.

We had a five-course meal. We paid around 145$ including service and taxes and boy, every bit of it was worth it.Elliot - Our server was a delightful, kind and impressive person.The kind of service and attention to details were spectacular! The food prep and serving was beautiful. Reservations:I took the vegetarian/vegan meal and my hubby chose white meat diet. They take these details while you call for booking and then they call you back to reconfirm your reservations.Food: They shared the pre-fix menu choices for lunch and for me they mentioned all that they have. and then they started to serve. wow! Not only the presentation of the food was unique but the food as well. We started goat cheese and pesto lollipops & popcorns and a choice of wine, the bottled to be shared between two of us and left over was given to take home. We chose white wine and we got again a delicious French wine (Chartier), which is like 20$ in LCBO and then we were served taro/oregano- truffled cappuccino & shrimp cappuccino(Hubby). The side of bread (we had choices) with 3 kinds of butter, I loved the flower butter. The bread was freshly baked and aromatic.Now for the mains, I had Quash/cashew Patty along with a fried roll. So yum! so so so yum! It was smoked and garnished with red quinoa. My hubby chose Foi Gras, he got it along with mushroom shaped breads served in a book box, a fried roll and a smoothie(I wish I was served too). the smoothie was beet/green apple and was delicious. For second mains, I had roots with hummus- delicious, roots were steamed to perfection, to compliment they had served the side of sweet quinoa and salty sauteed mushrooms.Oh so yum! My hubby had some Bass, which was first smoked in the grass and was shown to him for his approval to serve. Now the dessert:Some berry mouse with sorbet- oh so delicious so perfectly sweetened, along with blueberry cotton candy tree and Meringue to share. Then we got a choice of coffee and tea. they served Nespresso coffee along with Tea cakes (In a to-go box, so that you can take the leftovers). Well, It's not over yet.We also received an autograph from the chef, a jar of eggplant caviar, a big Meringue to take home along with tea cakes and wine. It was a memorable and delicious experience!

The lobster cappucino was odd but absolutely delicious.The beef/duck tartare was probably one of the best tartare i've had so far.

Truffle oil drizzled popcorn didn't taste much better than the cheese popcorn I would get out of a bag bought at the supermarket...as a matter of fact, the popcorn was stale! Pesto lollipop...didn't like the combination. The only item that was decent in the amuse bouche was the beef jerky.Started with a lobster cappuccino...ok that was really fantastic...but you can really feel like they put in tons of butter. Anything with butter is good right?Entree was smoked duck with beef...nothing special. Presentation was nice but taste was ordinary. The shrimp cannoli was ok but again taste was not memorable.Main was scallop with asparagus risotto. Scallop lacked a bit of salt and the risotto was bland. The entire dish was actually bland. I ate the 2 scallops and a bit of the risotto. The bar was actually decent in taste but again could taste tons of butter in the sauce.Dessert consisted of a cotton candy tree, some meringue, madeleines, and some sort of strawberry mousse cake with a thick coat of sugar that you need to crack before getting to the bottom of the cup. I wished I didn't mixed in the hard top sugar because it was just too much and it got stuck in my teeth and didn't add anything to the dessert. I've seen tons of pictures on Yelp about the dishes and they have not changed a bit. I feel like the menu hasn't been changed in ages...really lacking creativity.I must agree with the lower reviews that pricing is steep and taste is forgettable! Decor isn't even that nice.Montreal has tons of great restaurants so spend your money elsewhere.It might have been a great restaurants a decade ago, but it has not evolved and lots of better choices now."

Finally someone came after we complained but there was no apology at all. Food was ok but nothing special, it's all about presentation and performance. To make it worse, they charged $80 more for our drinks and thank god we noticed it before we paid. We questioned about it and they corrected the bill but it took another 15 min to correct and again, there was no apology at all. Overall it was such disappointing and unpleasant experience and I'll never go back or recommend this place to anyone."

I was a bit apprehensive since a lot of recent reviews seemed to be disappointed by the food but it turned out to be perfectly fine. It started with canapés of beef jerky, cheese sandwich lollipops, and truffle popcorn. All of them were lovely, but I thought the beef jerky was just meh. Tasted like good jerky but nothing other than that. The lobster bisque cappuccino delivers a strong flavor punch. I also liked the beef tartar and the squid tagliatelle . The veloute, foei gras, fish, risotto, and tenderloin were solid but lacked the wow factor. The desserts were all on the sweeter side.Overall, delivers strong on presentation.

Europea was that restaurant for me in 2016, so much so that I intend to omit some details of our experience so that it is a surprising treat for you, as well. I will leave you with this sentiment: the meal is an enchanting performance so sit back and take joy in it.I reserved well in advance, more than 8 weeks out, resulting in a lovely table by the window on the second floor overlooking the city street; during the summer, I would imagine that the area would come alive.As we reviewed the menu, we enjoyed a robust and tasty beef jerky, flavored popcorn, goat cheese lollipops, and herbed straws served in olive oil. They were an unexpected and delightful way to begin a meal filled with surprises. These little treats definitely set the right mood.In the end, we selected the 12-course tasting menu and were pleased with the decision. Note that a six-course table d'hôte and an à la carte menu are also available. Below are some of the items we enjoyed:- Arancini created to look like a truffle- Velvety lobster bisque with a cappuccino-like foam finish - so good I could have made a meal of it- Smoked lentil caviar in a crispy crust (a substitute for my salmon allergy)- Risotto with baby shrimp and beets- Calamari tagliatelle served with a quail egg and a creamy sauce, reminiscent of a carbonara - this was my sister's favorite- Pâté au torchon served with a tiny brioche- A well-prepared sea bass that was cooked in sweet hay and assorted citrus aromatics - this was my favorite- Cornish game hen cooked in breakable clay that was, unfortunately, a bit dry- Clever taste of braised beef layered with béarnaise and potatoes- A cheese tray that took into account our preferences, from a cellar of over 100 choices from Quebec- A wonderful assortment of sweet treats that begged for us to take home leftoversThroughout the 4-hour meal, the servers were energetic and playful. We thoroughly enjoyed the well-paced, thoughtfully-composed indulgences and appreciated how much the servers were very much a part of the overall experience. This meal has provided many lovely memories already so I encourage you to GO. Relish every moment of the experience."
/user_details?userid=zIXUuzj1c819jQLkqTfBBQ,Annie D.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"So my actual score for Europea if possible would be 10/5 ;)This was the best food experience of my life and I am not basing that on the price (I have paid much more for sub-standard food and service).So starting with the reservations, relatively easy process requiring a credit card. I'd suggest booking at least a month in advance.I had the signature tasting menu for $129.50 which consists of 10 courses. With a seating time of 9 pm, I KID YOU NOT, my friend and I were there till 1 am. So when I say this was an experience, it was a 4 HOUR FOOD EXPERIENCE!I don't eat beef. So since 2 of the courses were veal, they were more than great about substituting those courses (and not with vegetables as is often done).We were served by two people the whole night. The male server was great. I forget his 3name (we were there in June) but he was hilarious and had a very dry sense of humour. ***Regarding the courses (NOTE: these are the listed courses on the menu - you get served additional items that are not on the menu):Amuse-Bouche - Lobster cream cappuccino with truffle purée - both my bff and I could have had a bucket of this eachAppetizer 1) Al dente lemony calamari tagliatelle - so many textures, every bite was divineAppetizer 2) Smoked deer tartar with thin cut french fries - this was the best dish of the night for me, the presentation was amazing, it came in glass casing filled with smoke which was uncovered with drama lol - who knew raw deer with tiny french fries could taste so amazing  - menu item was slow cooked Quebec veal carpaccio which my friend enjoyedAppetizer 3) Foie gras au torchon, crispy langoustine, home brioche - bite-sized items with amazing flavourMain Course 1) Macadamia nut crusted Halibut pave - this was the most delicate dish of the night - buttery soft fishPalate cleanser - Crispy-melting white cheese ice mist sorbetMain Course 2) Cornish hen breast cooked and scorched on maple wood chips - great presentation, they bring up a whole breast partly through the cooking process and describe the cooking method - this was my second substituted dish - the menu item is Quebec veal cheeks slowly braised and cooked in clay - they bring up the whole item as it's cooking and make you break the clay open before plating itThe Europea cheese cellar - you get to choose whatever cheeses you want or as we did it, the fromager asks about your tastes and brings what he thinks would suit your palette  Dessert 1) My passport to sweetness - cheesecake-like dessert revealed after the server melts the ball of white chocolate it's inDessert 2 and 3) Candy tree from Guilty land/Mignardises (mini cakes/cookies) - last 2 courses combined with a candy floss tree - we asked ours to be packed because we were literally bursting at the seams by this time***Observations:So it seems like bits of food when it comes out but we started having a hard time after finishing the halibut (after the first main course) and we are gals with healthy appetites lol. Put together, IT'S A LOT OF FOOD!! Trust me, arrive hungry.The presentations of the courses were each like a mini-show, so pay attention - one of the unlisted items (salmon in pastry) came in a wood box shaped like a book, server opened both at the same time and smoke blew into our faces in the best possible way lolService is the best I have ever had at any restaurant. The servers were friendly, attentive (every time you get up to go to the washroom they replace your place setting, as soon as you are done dish is cleared way), not pretentious etc.Very accommodating in terms of dietary restrictions. I was glad that they actually replaced the veal dishes with other meat dishes and not vegetables.Amazing French house wine for $8 a glass! The restaurant is rather romantic - we were the only non-couple there, other than 1 large group. Definitely a place to take a date.At the end, you get a huge meringue, wrapped up in a bag to take home with you.At the end of the night when we were done, as we were going down the stairs, I saw our server going down before us. When we reached the bottom, he was standing there with the door open for us (WHAT, WHO DOES THAT?!?) - Am I getting through the fact that the service was AHHHHMAZING!I did some research before picking this restaurant out of all the high-end restaurants available in Montreal, and I ended up picking this one as it had the most unique menu items, an extensive tasting menu that gave you a bit of everything, and the rave reviews on service.And as expected, it was a truly marvelous experience."
/user_details?userid=efd7gp_vXRYcOysmlBhPsw,Keegan L.,"Menlo Park, CA",4 star rating,"Dinner is a show here, and it's a good one. Style and service are top notch, but do outshine the flavor for the most part. The beginning (tuna tartare and calamari bowl) and end (cotton candy tree and white chocolate sphere) were much more interesting and delicious when matched up against the main proteins of halibut and beef.We did the signature menu with elegance wine pairing for about C$200 per person, and after tax and tip for two came out to a total around $500. Worth it? That's up for debate. We had a blast, got very full, and enjoyed some unique flavors - for more than 3 hours. Expect to spend around 4 hours here from start to finish.The elegance wine pairing lacked complexity and depth, but did showcase a nice variety. Don't feel too bad about passing up the wine pairing if budget is a concern.I'm glad we did it, but have had my fill for a time.  While it did not set the bar for flavor for me, it's the gold standard for impeccable service, and carries quite a bit of entertainment value."

WOW.  We were wined and dined for the three hours, which it took to complete this meal.  Our server was amazing, attentive, and very professional. We opted for the Chefs Table overlooking the kitchen which was pretty neat. Being able to see the sous chefs, and chef Jérôme Ferrer work in the kitchen. The way the food was presented was a big show, that was a big part of it. You just need to go and experience it for yourself.  I don't have any negative comments about our experience. I will definitely dine here again next time were in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"Presentation was really the highlight of this dining experience.  The food was good but some substance was sacrificed for style.The lobster cappuccino for example was basically a shot of pretty good lobster bisque with the lobster removed and some foam on top.  I felt like I was drinking the sauce (albeit a very good one) meant for a very nice seafood dish of some kind.I just had a general sense the chef was trying too hard to create new combinations of techniques, flavors, and presentations. If I didn't have other high end dining experiences for reference, I think I would have found the dishes delicious enough, like 4-5 star good. But in actuality, with almost everything I tasted I thought he variation the chef introduced didn't add much to the dish and often detracted from a version of the dish I had somewhere else. I have complained that some high end restaurants are converging on similar recipes and presentation and I applaud Europea for trying to innovate.  But when you try to put a twist on things, you should make sure it is at least as good as the original. A lobster bisque without the lobster doesn't become magical just because you serve it like a cappuccino.  Smoked salmon served on what looked like fried wonton is tasteless if you don't warn the diner the book is filled with smoke and everything will be tasteless if you accidentally breath in the smoke. I also often thought we were served the components of a larger dish and/or the dish only had one note and needed something else on the plate.  In addition to the aforementioned lobster bisque (cappuccino), the veal cooked in clay pot was also a little odd. The presentation was good, with the waiter letting my wife break the pot before taking it back to kitchen for plating.  The civet sauce was fine, the potato slices on top were pleasantly crispy, the veal tasted good, if not extraordinarily so.  But the dish has only one flavor note nor variations on texture except for the first bite or two on the potatoes (they got soggy quick and just kind of merged into the meat and sauce).Cotton candy tree was like meh, whatever.  Meringue at the bottom of the tree was sweeter than usual and a lot sweeter than the ones in plastic bag they give out to go so I am guessing it was a slip on quality control.  The ones from the bags were spot on and I have been snacking on them since my trip to Europea.Overall, I think the place is adequate for a good date night out (especially if you haven't been to a lot of high end restaurants using modern cooking techniques) but at this price point I expect more than just adequate."
/user_details?userid=4sihQEwM1_uJthjXqNKFEA,Samantha N.,"Markham, Canada",2 star rating,"2.5 starsLikes:- Service was attentive and a lot of thought was put into delivering their dishes in unique ways.Not a fan of:- Our bill came to around $300, but there was no wow factor in the food. Not a single dish we had was memorable. Don't get me wrong, everything was cooked well, but the flavour profiles were very average.- I requested for a hot water, it was served with lemon and it came out to be $7.50 on the bill. I understand this is an upscale restaurant, but that's still a bit ridiculous.A friend ours, who used to live in Montreal recommended this restaurant to us. We decided to go with the 6 course Discovery Menu ($94.50 pp) instead of their 10 course Signature Tasting Menu ($129.50) as the foie gras and cheese plate didn't appeal to me.Prior to our order, our waitress came by and gave us a note from the chef. The personal touch was nice. Shortly after, another waitress asked if we would like ""cigars"" from a wooden box, which were actually fried cheese sticks. It tasted like those you would get from the freezer section in the supermarket, but again, it was a nice touch.The amuse bouches for the evening included a very thinly sliced beef jerky hung on a string, some buttery sticks, truffle oil popcorn and a fried truffle ball. I enjoyed the beef jerky a lot, from its presentation to the punch of flavour it offered. The rest of the items were just...meh. Before our first course was served, our waitress brought out a wooden box. As I opened the box, smoke was released, and a small piece of smoked salmon, with a delicious lemony cream served on what seemed like a fried wonton wrapper sat near the corner of the box.  At first, the burst of the lemon cream was delicious, but the salmon got progressively salty.Our first course was a lobster cream cappuccino with truffle puree. It was essentially a tasty lobster bisque, served in the form of a cappuccino, with no lobster meat in it. The lobster flavours were carried out very nicely and the truffle puree near the bottom was a good complement. Overall, this was a solid dish and at par with restaurants in this price range.For the second course, I went for the mushroom tart. Our waitress seared the enoki mushrooms in a sesame soy sauce in front of us on a hot cast iron plate. The thin butter puff pastry was rich and flaky and the ingredient combination worked well. The flavour profile wasn't anything special, but I did enjoy the addition of green onions which was sweet and not too pungent. My husband's dish was a big disappointment. The calamari tagliatelle sounded great on paper, but we both felt it failed on delivery. Texture wise, the calamari was cooked perfectly, and it is the first time we have had calamari served in the form of a ""pasta"". But the flavours were underwhelming. The quail egg and parmesan emulsion somehow got lost in the dish. We expected a bold and flavourful dish, but it ended up being bland and unexciting.Before our mains were served, we got a palate cleanser, which was a cheese ice cream with yuzu foam, mixed with small chunks of green apple and cucumber. This was very refreshing and definitely prepared our taste buds for the next course.For my main, I ordered the fish, which was cod instead of halibut for the evening. Prior to serving the dish, the waitress brought out the cod filet in a dutch oven lying on a stack of hay. They then brought it back into the kitchen for plating. The macadamia crust on the fish was quite tasty, although I wish there was more of it. Overall, the dish was executed well, but don't expect anything over the top when it comes to flavours. My husband ordered the braised veal cheeks. The waitress brought out the veal cheeks in a clay enclosure, where they asked him to hammer it open. The experience was fun, and when they brought the plated dish out again, it was a disappointment. The veal cheeks were tender, but the flavours were so mild, it was borderline bland. As for desserts, the cotton candy tree and sugary treats that came with it was cute and whimsical, but that's about it. Everything served was WAY too sweet. The only item I enjoyed was the mango vanilla pudding, which resembles the small cup desserts at AYCE Japanese buffets, except the vanilla pudding is much more creamy, and the mango puree on top is more tart. After that, we were served another dessert, which was a vanilla cream crumble, with blueberries at the bottom.Overall, there wasn't enough substance in the food as way too much thought and focus was put on the experience. If you are looking for just adequate food, and enjoy the bells and whistles added to service and presentation, then this place may work."

Jerky on a clothes line, cheddar popcorn, cheese on a stick, and bread sticks with an olive oil base. We chose the most expensive menu option. Worth every penny!  THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND!! A dinner that consisted of about 15 courses as well as a few surprises thrown in the mix. Each course was displayed in the most creative way.

I live in NYC, where we have an abundance of fine dining options; I've also dined at reputable places around the world and I love exploring the food culture in every city. I can eat cheaply and expensive and enjoy everything across the spectrum. This place was not worth it.The food: I enjoyed the lobster cappuccino and the tagliatelle, but the other dishes were subpar. Even the dishes that I enjoyed were not a 5 star dining experience; I could have enjoyed these for cheaper at other restaurants. The other food was just ok. You don't get what you pay for in terms of quantity or quality.The service was absolutely atrocious and snobby. I was greeted initially by a friendly gentleman, but the hostess/server that I had in my dining room was a complete snob. She was attending to other tables, never even gave me a glance or stopped by to see if I needed anything (which I did, several times). She attended to parties that arrived after I did, with menus, water, etc - I saw her asking them if they had any questions about the menu - took their orders before she even came to me once after dropping off a menu at some point. I don't know if it's that I was dining alone, I was the only non-Caucasian person, didn't speak French? Regardless, I felt completely snubbed. I asked for a drink prior to any of my courses, and she didn't remember. I asked her again in the middle of my first course (since she hadn't stopped by), and she made no apologies for forgetting. She finally brought it toward the end of my second course. I understand that these things can be forgotten, but what's important to me is how someone responds to issues like this.I went to Bouillon Bilk for dinner several days before, spent only a little more for three additional courses for dinner, for much better quality food and service.

This was our splurge meal while we were in the city, so we went for the 10-course tasting menu with wine pairing. Ten courses is a lot, of course, but tasting menus are usually very small, ""tasting"" portions. The portions here at Europea were not always as small as typical tasting portions, but on top of that, you get way more food than the ten courses you pay for. I think they must have served us 4 amuse-bouches before the tasting menu even begun! And the final sweet dessert course was also several different items, more than just one sweet. And then -- and then! -- they even sent us home with more packaged food! Carrmelized nuts, cookies, a meringue... The whole thing was absolutely bananas. If you are looking for a special occasion meal in Montreal and are willing to spend the money on it, look no further. If you are looking to spend less, you may still order here a la carte and eat very well. Everything was spectacular. Highly recommended!"

We dined with our 3 year old and booked the earliest time to make sure we wouldn't bother other diners. We ordered the tasting - Grande experience. We asked to order from the a la carte menu for our 3 year old and ended up having to pay for a mini tasting for him without our server telling us -an additional $50 and the charge of his entree. With this caliber I felt like we should have been informed that we would be forced to do that. Even though I called in before I made my reservations asking if I can order from the a la carte menu for my 3 year old. The person that answered the phone said yes however I was charged for a mini tasting for my 3 year old even though he only ate a quarter of 1 out of the 4 dishes that he got. Put that aside... in the beginning of the meal service was great as we were one of the three tables in the restaurant. However, 1 hour into the meal and the restaurant was near full that's when service started to drop. While listening in on my neighboring tables I realized they missed the water for our first course to wash our hands? - not a big deal. But then they forgot our cheese course and I had to remind them. Also, our soiled napkins a big piles of them - yes there were many because I was dining with a 3 year old were left on our table and I constantly had to ask the servers to remove and replace them.The meal also lasted 3 hours. The pace was fine in the beginning when we were the third table being served however, when the restaurant was near full that's when service slowed and we were waiting really long in between courses. Also, at the end of the meal I went downstairs before my husband and child and I didn't receive the chocolate which would have been a great touch but I was missed. Again service issues there.Don't get me wrong our servers were really nice, funny and accommodating however the hiccups above lowers their rating on service. And at this price point I do expect the service to mirror that.Finally onto the food, we did have a lot of fun and it was very interactive. However, the food didn't taste amazing. It was very good however not perfect. The last dish - healthy guilt trip - was the least memorable course and the beef course was good but again not unique or amazing. The decor of the restaurant was really nice and the washrooms were small yet decor spot on and very cozy and clean. Would I recommend this restaurant? Yes I would. However, please make sure you keep in mind there will be service issues and the food will not be perfect."

/user_details?userid=sTkCM0cPGIGG1ZjOIjjGig,Eva S.,"Princeton, NJ",1 star rating,"We were in Montreal for 2 nights. First night we dined at Bonaparte, it was great. Second night we dined at Europea, the food was just ok. It's not bad, but nothing to write home about. The portion for the tasting menu was tiny for the price. We ordered one bottle of wine, and it was the first time we still had half a bottle left after the main course. They tried to stuff you with cheap desserts. The wine list is terrible. High mark up for bad wine selections. I typically leave a flat amount for tips on the wine since restaurants already charge a lot for wines and I leave 17-20% tips on food. The service was ok. It's not particularly good or bad. But when we were about to leave, the waitress came to me to complain I did not give enough tips! I have dined at many high end restaurants worldwide and had never experienced such treatment. I do not think this is the kind of service one should expect from a restaurant which markets itself at this level. In my opinion, this is a shoddy ""high end"" restaurant for tourists who are unlikely to return."

/user_details?userid=eNORuY4cjyQStMygVSSYZQ,Meimei Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably the most fancy and most definitely extra restaurant I've been to in Montreal. The service here is not like any other fine dining restaurant. We first heard about this restaurant from friends who came here to try the dessert. The cotton candy tree dessert (called ""passport to something"") is the reason we came; but the amazing appetizers and service was why we stayed. Right after taking our order, a wonderful array of appetizers was presented to us, each in a unique and memorable way. For example, the tartar was delivered to us in a book filled with smoke, while the cheesesticks were delivered to us as cuban cigars. Each dish was beautifully made and incredibly delicious. Paired with a great wine and cheese selection, Europea soon became one of my favourite places to go to celebrate a special occasion. When my friend left Montreal, she even said that she would come back here one day, just for dinner one more time!"

/user_details?userid=uABgKX42VTRqGDUhSC_3mg,Adam C.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"It's hard to believe that the Michelin Guide refuses to consider restaurants in Canada. Europea is quite simply one of the finest restaurants in the world, and the dining experience is worthy of every type of acclaim. I really wanted to splurge for a dinner and when I booked a trip to Montreal, the first thing I did was make a reservation for Europea (you'll need a reservation made more than a month in advance, and if you don't show up to your booking, you'll incur a $200 charge). The style of the restaurant is fine dining, with a French-Italian focus. The dress code is ""business casual,"" but men should wear at least a jacket or tie (preferably both). When you arrive, you'll be received into a handsome dining room, with immaculate and bilingual staff ready to attend to any desire. There was a personal note from the chef waiting at my table. I had the 8 course exploration menu, with wine pairings chosen by a sommelier. They started with an amuse-bouche of dried meat, goat cheese and maple smoked salmon lox. The subsequent courses were simply perfect, each one was served with an expertly chosen wine and the waitstaff attentively refilled my wine glass before it was even half empty. The presentation of the dishes was also impressive. The cappuccino lobster bisque changed my life, and the veal carpaccio was ten times better than anything I've had in Italy. The menu provides an excellent fois gras and handmade pasta with quail egg and caviar. The main seafood dish was fresh halibut and the main meat dish was clay-baked veal cheek, and the tasting menu gave me an opportunity to taste both. The meal concluded with a cheese course and assorted bonbons. The total bill was about $200 per person, but I would gladly pay twice that for the Europea experience."

For a premium price, the menu, service, and restaurant seems 2002. Nothing stands out, though everything seems familiar enough and increasingly better with wine.There are many places I enjoy when I visit Montreal. This is not one I would want to visit again. There are equally expensive options with better food, service, and experience."

/user_details?userid=cRnXqo1bLPhpfiKSShkunw,Chiyo M.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been this restaurant this summer with four of my friends, and we all tried its signatured tasting menu. When walking into the place, the warm and sweet interior dining environment plus the Zen feeling table decoration created a delight dining atmosphere. However, the table decoration might occupy a lot of the table space that plates had to be placed very closely.I believe the tasting menu included around 3 appetizers, 5 main dishes, and 2 deserts. Surprisingly, we got 3 small snacks before we formally started, and 2 more desserts afterwards as easter egg. All the dishes were in great looking and showed ingenuity that we wanted to photograph every detail. But when it comes to the taste, I would say that I was a little bit disappointed. I expected more layers of flavors, and more connections bewteen different food ingredients, but I felt flat. And some ingredients did not match to each other in one dish. The service was really good and sweet. Some servers speak French, which I do not quite understand.Overall, my dining experience was good in this place, but I would think it over whether I want to come back, considering its price."

/user_details?userid=Da_eLsIvrxdgheyTllfSqg,Luke R.,"American Canyon, CA",5 star rating,"I'm still not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review about the best meal I've ever had. Back when my husband and I were living in NYC, we decided for his Birthday in May 2015, we'd drive to Montreal. It's about a 6 hour drive, 9 if you bring your Beagle with you because you want him to have international status. I made the reservation a couple weeks in advance noting that come he'll or high water, we were going to do the Tasting Menu. And I am so glad we did. Here's why:Firstly, they take you thru a journey. I always thought when people said that, it was cheesy, but the only think cheesy about this restaurant was the cheese cigars and the goat cheese truffle. The waiter really takes you thru the courses (of which I lost count after 9 including palette cleansers and amouse bouche plates). Here's an example:Waiter (holding what appears to be a book): ""would you care for some light reading?""Me: ""ok!""Waiter sets down book: ""please now open your book.""I open said book to a plume of smoke from the burning apple wood in the book and a goat cheese truffle drizzled in squid ink (I think?). Either way, explosions in my mouth.Oh! And:Waiter: ""would you care for a cigar?""Me: ""um.... a cigar?""Waiter opens a humidor: ""a cheese cigar."" Presenting a Camembert Fried cheese stick. I'm not doing the food justice as it was such an incredible night of flavor and presentation. I never thought having dinner could be so much fun, but Europea has become my favorite restaurant. I live in Napa now, so it's not easy to go to dinner there even on a weekend trip to Montreal, but it's on the list of next trips and I guarantee you, Europea will be the main event.Takeaways from this review:Best restaurant everCheese cigarsLight reading"
/user_details?userid=E8N-hgXND7_wUGOA5u9jKA,Howard G.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"This one is going to be long.......just warning you. So this was the 1st time I've ever been to a restaurant that provides the tasting menu options, either $89.50/person for the 6 course or $119.50/person for the 12 course. Either way, you're getting a large variety of dishes to quench your palate. The way it's explained, the 12 course option has dishes 1/2 the size of the 6 so you get the same amount of food, however, in between they bring little amuse bouches so it's definitely more food. The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber, very attentive and helpful. I will say that my experience in many Montreal restaurants lead me to believe service is not in their vocabulary but Europea was truly an exception. We had 13 people at our table, some a little more demanding with their food....""less sauce, no sauce, this or that on the side"", etc. No problem, they accommodated everything. For the vegetarians there is a separate tasting menu and they even allowed to pick and choose some items from the vegetarian and some from the regular. Each dish is carefully placed and then explained to the group in perfect detail.The food was outstanding! We all had the 6 course meal. They start with a variety of amuse-bouches such as peppered jerky, cheese lollipops, assorted butters and breads, flavored popcorn and more. Then to prepare you for the amazing meal to come, their signature lobster bisque cappuccino arrives.......holy crap! It's worth going to Europea just for that.  You then get to choose one of 3 appetizers and one of 3 main course. The portions are quite large. My ricotta ravioli with sauteed mushroom, truffle sauce and pan-seared foie gras was to die for, fortunately it didn't come to that. The breads are all freshly baked and amazing, I did not need to have 3 pieces of the french baguette but I never let that stop me. They also do some very unique dishes.....one amuse-bouche is a box that looks like a book. You open the book and out comes this amazing smokey smell like logs in a fire and it reveals a tiny but delicious salmon in a small cup, I forget what else was it it but it was really good. Then comes dessert, also a barrage of little dishes that includes sorbet, cotton candy tree, panna cotta, a variety of macaroons and cookies, caramel and nut cheesecake lollipops, nuts, coconut marshmallow squares and more. I will admit I was surprised by the quantity of food. I'm not a small eater and fully expected to have alot of small dishes and to leave hungry.....boy was I wrong, I left stuffed. Europea is worth the visit, however be prepared for a long night. It's not because the service is slow, it's because the food just keeps coming and you can't wait to see what they bring next. Not the place to go if you need to catch a movie. However, if you want a really nice restaurant with great food and that allows you to spend time with the person or people you're with, this is the perfect choice."

/user_details?userid=hOanhLERJDJoiO39c4tPKg,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"The food did not stop coming out.  The flavors!  The flavors!  I had the vegetarian ""shorter"" tasting menu.  If you want the veggie menu, you have to ask for it, because they don't present it to you immediately.  When the first two courses of the tasting menu came out, there were on a little spoon and a tiny cup.  I was worried that I'd have to eat elsewhere afterward if everything on a six-course tasting menu would be bite-sized.  But how wrong I was!  The serving sizes got progressively larger.  Each time I got a bit more full.  By the time my main course came out, I was officially stuffed.  And I still had the dessert course and the optional cheese course ahead of me.They were incredibly accommodating to my dietary restrictions.  The main course I wanted had gnocchi.  I asked them if it was wheat and potato-based, and my server immediately responded that they can provide a vegetable substitution of mushrooms if I prefer.  I said yes, and the meal was excellent.  So many different kinds of mushrooms!  I opted to have a cheese course in between my main and dessert. And I'm soooo glad that I did.  Definitely don't skip the cheese course.  They have a cheese-man and supposedly hundreds of cheese in the cellar.  He asks you what you want - taste, texture, age, whatever -- and he brings it to you based on your ideas if you don't request something specific.  The cheese was probably one of the best parts of the entire meal.  But I love cheese (though I can't eat cow cheese anymore), so I'm partial.  He brought me two sheep's milk and two goat's milk cheeses.My only complaint is that the dessert -- as intricate, delicious, and creative as it was -- did not flow well with my vegetarian menu.  As you can probably see from some pics, they bring you a tree with pink cotton candy, plus more small candies, plus lots of cookies, plus a custard, plus something else, and a cute box to take it all home in since you definitely won't get through it while you are there.  Don't get me wrong - it was impressive and yummy (though I could only eat a few bites), but I would have preferred if, for the vegetarian menu, I was offered something fresher, such as fancy fresh fruits, gelato, candied nuts, other cheeses, or lighter and more plant-based dessert fare without so much sugar.The service was incredible.  I felt like a star eating there - for an almost three-hour meal on my own.  I would absolutely recommend this place, but keep in mind the dessert course if you order the veggie tasting menu.  And don't forget to get the cheese!"

/user_details?userid=I_xIXBmUZgz0tJfIa-Q1PA,Krazi P.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I went to Europea with my husband and mother in law during our Christmas stay in Montreal. We had a few recommendations for this place from friends so we were thrilled to be able to make a reservation to try (at 9pm). Sad to say our experience was poor in all aspects. When you go in they throw all these free ""treats"" at you before you even speak to your waitress or have a chance to order. Obviously free stuff is always nice but there are also priorities. I'm there to eat their food not just the free things. Some of those free items included popcorn which was stale and had been sitting a while before serving. I don't understand why it has such high ratings, I've done many tastings and this is the worst in terms of taste and service. I do not recommend and suggest you to stay away, the creative presentation is not worth it.THE FOOD - We all got the 10 course tasting and it was disappointing,  although creative with presentation. The food temperature was luke warm at best for being ""freshly cooked"". Many of the courses had obvious signs of pre-prepared for a while and not made to order. For instance the fish dish was fairly cool in temperature even though they presented it cooking in a hot steaming pot moments prior to serving,  and the meat dish plate was warmed to the point where the sauce drizzled on the plate had partially evaporated. To need to warm plates for a 3 person dinner is unheard of, this is more common for large parties. Out of all the courses, I only liked the lobster-less bisque, beef cheek, and the white chocolate mousse dessert. The macarons from our dessert tree (also pre-prepared) was stale! I love macarons so that was a major disappointment.THE SERVICE - was poor, they are never around except to serve food and occasionally fill water. But when you're in need they are not there, you would have to wait 15min before a waitress will come see you because that's when you're roughly done your course. They served cold, hard, chewy bread with COLD butter that was not spreadable. When asked for softer butter they say that they don't have any and even if they take it out of the fridge it wouldn't warm up to be soft. This comment was appalling, I was expected to eat my bread with HARD butter because the restaurant wasn't able to upkeep with demand and did not communicate this with the customer prior to serving the butter and explaining the issue. I was also a little chilly during my meal so I was wearing my  jacket for most the time and the waitress only commented at the last course and turned on the heater that was sitting there the whole time, a little late but I still liked the gesture. OTHER - plates were not clean for a high end restaurant, and they only cleaned our table  of crumbs at the end of our meal (what's the point?) You get a lot of freebies from start to finish which is always nice to get free stuff,  but I can't say they tasted awesome. I got 2 bags of meringue to take away at the end.  Also the cotton candy on our dessert tree was store bought and not house made, that is not something I expected from a high end restaurant, but I do not consider this as apart of my overall review, just a comment."

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I booked a table for our two year anniversary, and we ordered the 12-course tasting menu. Our trip to Europea was motivated by curiosity, and it was certainly rewarded.As we stepped in, three tall, handsome waiters smiled at us. The first motioned for me to step forward, and the second directly me to the third after I named myself. My wobbling high-heeled feet followed the gentleman up the stairs into the elegant restaurant, where our table greeted us in a corner. Each table was dressed simply, with a flower, candle and small Inuit statuette. The menus were presented. Then food came. Fast.First were a series of complimentary amuse-bouches, and thanks to social media, I already knew each one of them by heart. They look amazing and novel - they taste good. Was it my idealization of each item based on Instagram snapshots? The maple glazed jerky did not taste of maple, the truffle popcorn tasted like... popcorn, and I can't remember much of those little sticks dipped in olive oil. Hot, melty cheese sticks in a cigar box were offered.Just as fast came the lobster cappucino. It was rich and creamy, just like a hot chocolate. Unlike a coffee, however, it did not pack a punch. Then came the famous smoked salmon in its enchanted box. A fun, quirky moment that was mildy diminished by the sober flavors of the bite. Beets lended the risotto their beautiful color, but not their taste. Shrimps? I think I saw two. The calamari tagliatelle was amazing presentation and ""mouthfeel"", but was way too salty (it also came apparent at this point that the masterminds of Europea really love squid ink croutons!) The foie gras was beautiful, as only an untouched product of such quality can be. It spoke for itself, and I gobbled it without its little brioche. The little crispy langoustine was the first item to really capture my tastebuds. It was crunchy, warm and bursting with flavour. The citrus caramel was a perfect touch, reminiscing of imperial rolls...?At this point, the pace of the dinner had slowed down, and my stomach was grateful. The fish course was presented to us in its cookware, smelling of grapefruit and hay. The fish was great, and my partner absolutly loved it. The yuzu mist was refreshing indeed, and the frozen yogurt especially delicious. Yuzu can be very overwhelming and unfortunately, I swallowed the mist wrong, irritating my upper airways for the following hour. Still cool tho. The Cornish hen was my personal favorite, and I still gaze at its picture fondly every night. I broke the clay in which it cooked, scared to maim the tender meat inside. The plate was such a comfort combination, with umami-zing wild mushrooms on a little pillow of buttery mash. Another meat course came under the deceptive look of a sundae. The custard was all butter and potatoes, and the beef, although nicely acidic and savoury, made my bloated stomach wail for mercy. I thanked myself for not wearing that tight black dress. A break was given. We were offered to either visit the cheese cellar, or name our preferences from the restaurant's impressive collection. Not able to name any award-winning cheese, we followed the... Cheese Master? The cheese cellar had, perhaps, twenty cheeses in display - those who were truly outstanding, as the Lord of Fermented Dairy explained. We chose a 6 years old cheddar, a 2015 award-winning tomme, a no-nonsense goat cheese, and le Bleu Bénédictin. Notice how the latter is the only one I remember by name. That's because I liked it so much I asked for its name, and lo and behold, the Chief Commander of Fungi and Lactose gave me another slice of the heavenly bleu.Feeling that the second half of the dinner was definitively better than the first, I relaxed into a delightful food coma. Then came the sugar onslaught. Three courses were dedicated to desserts, and they came all at once. My partner smiled and giggled like a little boy as he picked cotton candy  leaves from the tree of Guilt. The box of warm madeleines was fresh and delightful. A fun plate of edible trinkets came, with pieces of moist honey cake, chocolate mousse, and a dollop of ice cream. As I prepared to dig in, the waiter said ""wait"", and proceeded to drown everything in liquid chocolate. I wish they had big glasses of cold milk as an option.  This 2.5 hour-long dinner had ended. We paid, a cab was called, and we were given a farewell pavlova. Thank you Europea for the amazing time, and especially to the amazing staff for making each moment perfect. Till next time my wallet is too full.P.S. On my way out, I noticed a young man distractingly eating his calamari while reading a book, alone. I guess Europea can also be a neighbourhood bistro!"

The decor is very beautiful and our service was excellent. We started with the champagne duo which was a 2006 Dom and a Krug for $90. The Dom was great but similar to many other champagnes like Louis Roderer, Perrier jouet, etc. the Krug was outstanding! We loved it and it was the first Krug we've ever had. We both opted for the larger tasting menu. We also did one premium wine pairing and one divine. The amuse bouches were good but not great. Out of all the items we had, the only things that really stood out were the fois grais and the Krug. Everything else was just ok. Another gripe was toward the end they decided to 'downgrade' my champagne from Krug to Laurient Perrier and 'upgrade' my boyfriends so that we would have the same champagne. The Krug was exceptionally better so we wish they would have left the original pairing. Also, we asked to revisit the Krug at the end and the waitress had to go check to see. They did it for us, but you would think after spending $1000 for the bill for 2 people that would be no problem!Maybe it's because we went to Joe Beef the night before and every single dish we had was mind blowing and the wine was fabulous for 1/3 of what we paid here, but we would not return anytime soon. It is a fun dining experience and I would recommend it for a special occasion, but I am more about the quality of the food and wine above all else."

Please don't judge LOL.ANYWAY... This is definitely one of my top-5 favorite restaurants. Best man was buying - we did the Chef's choice 12+ course meal, and it was phenomenal! I can't even begin to recount each and every item, other than each was delicious and left me wanting more.There is some crazy twist to each and every course. Perhaps with a few the crazy twist was a little ""over the top"" and that serving could have used a bit more simplicity, but that's me being really picky... There's truly nothing that could be said negative about the flavor and excitement of each and every serving.I'll be back - this will become my costly, guilty pleasure every time I visit Montreal.

/user_details?userid=0X40RJmnkqozfz2IuPogxA,Conan W.,"Vienna, VA",4 star rating,"Perfect atmosphere and service. The food is artistically displayed, yet the taste is not top notch. I like the idea of making calamari spaghetti, but it was too salty, destroying the freshness and blurring the layers of flavor. Quite the opposite, halibut is not salty enough. That dish was composed of mild ingredients and without some strong flavor, it didn't have a theme. Desserts are too sweet but typically French. In conclusion, they failed to make an impression with the best ingredients."
/user_details?userid=omdrcV7wuM7vvcw5oiIYTg,Adam P.,"Charlestown, MA",1 star rating,"I was quite disappointed with my meal at Europea. The ratings, reviews and lists of top restaurants all would indicate that our dinner would be an exceptional experience. Unfortunately it was exceptional experience for all the wrong reasons.Europea may at one point (25 years ago?) have been a good restaurant. But to say that it is out of date would be an understatement of enormous proportions.The food theatrics accompanying each dish not only do not cover up the mediocre quality of the ingredients and tastes, but also result in a wait staff that is overly harried and unacceptably inattentive. The food itself is poor. The service is weak. The meal was a bad concept poorly executed.We ordered the tasting with a wine pairing. It might have been a very busy evening - that's not an excuse for waiting 45 minutes to deliver the first glass of wine - which was a glass of champagne we had to request separately (not a part of the pairing) when it was clear no wine was on the way. When the first pairing did appear, it accompanied a dish that was overly complex and simultaneously bland - over produced, over thought, overly creative. I never thought that it was possible to be ""overly creative,"" but now I have experienced Europea.The space was not clean, and somehow even the dishes and cutlery were dated and lame. We pulled the plug and asked for the check before we arrived at desert, and even had to struggle to get the waitstaff to put us out of our misery. By the time we did get the bill, we were laughing uncontrollably about how awful the entire experience had been.The meal was expensive. $700 for the two of us. That would be fine for an amazing meal and a great experience. But given the level of execution here, I feel like we were scammed."

I have eaten at restaurants all over the world at all different price points and this place is all show and no substance. The food was meh at best and not paced to the preference of diners, but instead to the restaurant's plan and preference. No individual service. And sooo expensive. I've been to some showier restaurants, like Jose Andres in DC -- mezcal foam and whatnot -- fun and delicious, and so we gave this a shot -- but it was missing the delicious piece and the service piece. Just all show."
/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",3 star rating,"We went to Europea expecting to be blown away by an experience similar to that of Per Se or a Michelin star restaurant based upon the reviews here. This place has pretty good food. The service is excellent. But, unfortunately, I was not blown away by any one dish. The flavors never challenged my palate. There was something about eating here that felt very assembly-line-ish. Every table had the same amuse bouche. Every table was eating the same Lobster Cappuccino. Every table had the same desserts. So while the food was pleasantly presented, it didn't feel like it was served with love. I imagined rows of hundreds of beef jerky apps lined up forever in the kitchen. Europea puts you through the motions of a fine dining restaurant, but without very much choice or personal aspect to the food. It's a bit like swimming in a pool as a child vs a creek. Sure, the pool is a safe bet. But it's sanitized. The creek has characted and memories. Eating here after eating at the small family restaurant Toroli made me feel sad that this type of experience is what we call fine dining. The meal experience at Europea was clearly designed to appease tourists and wanna-be foodies. I was not impressed by the thin veneer. If I'm going to pay $60 for lunch, I want to be blown away by the food. This simply did not happen. It was a safe experience with little culinary adventure involved. Don't be fooled Yelpers, this is not a 4.5/5 experience."

The only things I would recommend ordering from the tasting menu (which you can order separately!) are the lobster cream cappuccino w/truffle puree and either the sea bass filet or the clay pot cornish hen entree. Everything else was forgettable and didn't challenge or inspire my palette...or otherwise move me in any way.Such a shame because the restaurant is beautiful and the service is wonderful, but the price tag is too steep for a forgettable meal.(Also, I noticed someone commented on the poor state of the restrooms and laughed it off.

We had the same Bordeaux wine at both restaurants. We had appetizers, entrées and desserts at both, but for me, everything here at Europea was ""show without substance"".My mushroom appetizer was absolutely bland and was worse than a home cook. I couldn't eat it, and I left virtually the entire plate untouched, however, the wait staff did not seem to understand my disappointment.I ordered what should have been a phenomenal halibut. They came out with their well-worn roasting pan to present my halibut cooked within as if it deserved the ""voila"" they presented it with, and my partner was presented with a hammer to break the salt dome of her veal cheek dinner -- which after the presentation was quickly ushered back into the kitchen. A solid 10 minutes passed before we saw our plated dinners, and my halibut was completely overcooked and dry. Again, I did not finish my meal, and again our wait staff did not seem to understand our disappointment.The coup d'état was the cheesy presentation of a sugar filled dessert display consisting of cotton candy and little plastic bags hanging from a ""tree"". When was the last time you ate cotton candy?!?I cannot believe we spent more than the Michelin dinner we had last night! It was probably the most disappointing and expensive dinner I've had in a long time. Worse, the wines are overpriced by 30% or more, and cocktails average $20. I have a feeling that their ratings come from the fact that they serve a lot of ""stuff"" that is unexpected given that you are only ordering an appetizer and an entrée. But it is all show without the culinary skills beneath it. Meals served under glass and salt domes, or dishes served with fog blowing dry ice do not make memorable meals unless your into schtick.I cannot imagine any locals returning to this place after they have been duped the first time. If you like a lot of average food, then this may be the place. But if you want top-notch culinary cuisine, go visit Bouillon Bilk."

I'll try not to spoil anyone's time here as I believe some of the best parts of the meals are the ones hardly mentioned in the reviews. Throughout the whole meal, my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by each dish they brought out to us. There are no complaints, although I highly recommend that you anticipate on spending at least two hours here. Service was impeccable, as each server would elaborate on each item they brought out and any questions we had were answered. I'll reveal one secret: make sure to save room for the desserts they bring out in the end! This was one of the best meals of my life and although it requires some saving up for, Europea is worth it (and I don't think my boyfriend will ever be able to outdo this reservation ;) )"

They have the most interesting and creative presentations I've ever seen any restaurant anywhere! Do you sensually use every trick in the book and Minnie I've never even heard of to make a wildly creative presentation of the entire meal. You never knew what was going to come next - and do it quite a few items that were not mentioned at all - extra little appetizers and extra desserts that were unexpected but quite welcome.However this does come at a price. They were two of us and we each had one fixed price menu at 79+ one glass of wine at about 20. In the overall bill before tip was 250. So this is an investment.  As for the actual quality of the food some of the things were great and amazing. Some were OK. And somewhere not to my taste. All of the questions were generally pretty small and tiny although there were quite a few extras as I mentioned. The scallop appetizer which is about $23 on its own but was surprisingly a single scallop. The fish main course was surprisingly small. The lobster cappuccino was literally a shot glass of lobster bisque with some foam. The desserts were plentiful in fact they just kept coming in that was really too much in the way of sweets. We couldn't even eat all of them and they were not really great for the dietThe overall vibe was extremely high class although most of the customers were somewhat casual. The staff was very professional and nice. However our waiter really didn't speak English well and we couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time with this heavy French accent. And he was a bit humorless and stiff - but all of the other people we spoke to were very engaging.

This is a great value for this luxury dining experience. If you are a dessert person, you will it more because it was packed. Unfortunately we avoid refined sugar so we did not partake to it. We called and asked if there can be substitutions or refined sugar can be replaced by natural sweeteners so we can try the desserts. They said that the chef will do something.

We both got the decouverte menu. I chose to add the foie gras for $12. First came the cappuccino with lobster. Very tasty! Then the foie gras was good. Wasn't spectacular like the stuff we had in Quebec City but definitely above average. Then my main course of the scallop came. It was not fresh and had sand all over it. My hubby had the short rib and was Terrible. It was tough and bitter. Sauce was salty.  He gave up on it after 2 bites. We both exchanged for the seabass. Filet. It was much better but not exactly tasty. I guess we have been spoiled dining all over the world.  For French food you definitely cannot beat France.

I have to say, all the dishes were very creative and presentable, which elevated the entire dining experience. However, even though the dishes were feast to my eyes, not very much to my tastebuds. There are other restaurants in Montreal with better tasting food. And their dessert were lacking flavours.

It was very plain and had no flavor at all. There was no creativity as it seems they had put all their attention on the presentation. At the end of the night, I did not remember a single dish I enjoyed. Be aware that this place is extremely expensive. I curled up in fetal position and cried after I saw the bill.

We had a 4-course meal, but before all the food extravaganza started we had delicious amuse-bouche to open up our appetite. We had very thinly sliced cured meat, we had munched on truffle pop corn (??), and we got a bite of a macaron like thin Parmesan crisps sandwich filled with goat cheese. We then were presented with a tray full of delicious breads: herbs, baguette and olive roll. I wanted one of each, of course! Haha they were warm and all of them felt straight like out of the bakery's oven! The best part of the bread was the choice of butter we were offered to pair it with. Not kidding! This is the first time I have ever seen this, 3 types of butter, very delicately presented: fluffy sweet rose button butter, elderflower butter, and see weed crusted butter. Omg. After all that, we were given an espresso cup with a lobster bisque composition that had layers after layers of flavors. It just kept on getting better. Have I said omg?! Small, but just enough. Hmmmmm. Our second course was a choice of a pea gazpacho with shrimp or a tartar topped with duck bacon. Both dishes were fabulous, full of elegance, with gorgeous decorations, textures and colors. For our third course, we were given a choice between a beef with potatoes, scallops with a green risotto, or a Cornish hen with asparagus. My descriptions here are giving ZERO justice to the amazingness brought up to us. I got to try the hen and the scallops and it was orgasmic. The hen was so juicy and perfectly flavored, with a thinly crispy skin. Hmmm. The scallops were the best I had ever had. Super fresh, perfectly grilled, delicate under the teeth. Just perfect. And then we had dessert. But it came with a farandole of sweet treats!!! There was a gorgeous cotton candy tree with meringue pebbles and basketful of fresh (warm) Madeleines. The treats were exquisite! The actual dessert was made of layers of delicacies: crumbles, blueberries, some sort of whipped cream, gelato and a breakable sugar top. The meal was exquisite, the service impeccable and the whole thing a true adventure for all the senses!"

Let me preface this by saying that just based on the taste of the food itself vs price this place would likely be a 4-4.5 out of 5, as the taste wasn't mind-blowing and I've had some similar dishes elsewhere for cheaper. However, this resto kills it when it comes to unique presentation and service, honestly that's what its all about!Examples: dessert was a ""tree"" with cotton candy as the leaves and pastries on the branches. One appetizer came in a giant book instead of a plate and had smoke coming out when you opened it. Honestly, the restaurant gets away with some really crazy ideas that somehow still works. It'll confuse your taste buds but you definitely won't (shouldn't) dislike it! I had the bass filet with beet noodles which apparently was one of their signature dishes and it was really really good and freshly steamed! The portions may be small but if you do their course menus you'll definitely be full. Go for the food, stay for the experience."

As such, our meal was very rushed and the food tasted stale and reheated. We were rushed to our seats and promptly began our meal with the amuse-bouche appetizers (which was our favorite part of the meal). The beef jerky, truffle popcorn, and cheddar crisps were delicious. Seconds after, we were served stale, reheated bread with hard butter fresh from the fridge. Cheddar cigars were then brought to our table, along with risotto balls (also very delicious, but so is anything stuffed with hot cheese). After the onslaught of finger food, we finally ordered. The lobster cappuccino was good, but it was more of a lobster bisque in a cup. You couldn't really taste the truffle - wasn't anything particularly extraordinary. We were then served ""a big book, but a short story"" which was full of maple smoke (surprising and very entertaining) and a small smoked salmon tart. After, we received our appetizers - calamari noodles with (what seemed like) Alfredo sauce and fish eggs, while my Prince Charming's was scallops with lobster beet ravioli. I preferred my lover's dish, he preferred mine. We then received a very odd palette cleanser - Yuzu sorbet with cucumber and a very bitter citrusy foam. Not to our liking, the bitterness and chunky texture of minced cucumber with the sorbet was off-putting.The entrees were pretty good, but again - nothing too extraordinary. My honey-boo-boo noted that it was nothing he couldn't discern from his own cooking. The pre-desert was overwhelming and contained a plethora of sweets - from cotton candy to macarons and white chocolate madeleines. Then we received the actual desert, at which point I had already contracted diabetes. It was a raspberry sorbet on top of a fresh cream on top of a blueberry cobbler (for the love of God, do not mix this together). My boyfriend and I felt like toddlers on a sugar-high before nap-time - slightly nauseous and not likely to sleep anytime soon.Overall the meal was good, but nothing as amazing as the presentation of the food would lead you to believe. Atmosphere of the restaurant was slightly confusing as it was a French/Japanese fusion (the change back and forth between upbeat French cafe tunes and zen garden music was a journey in itself).Good, but not good enough to come back. I think this is largely to do with our running late and the restaurant attempting to close on time - our dining experience was slighted as a result."

This was sign of the good things to come.We attended the Simon Durivage, Friends Brunch, a novelty as Restaurant Europea does not usually serve Brunch, and it was their first time.We started with the viennoiserie; small loaf of brioche (while respectable not my favorite, I prefer Pain Dore's), croissants (the best I've ever tasted) and tasty chocolatines, served with brown whipped butter, plain butter and flower butter (appeared to have violet petals through it). The Fresh squeezed orange juice was sweet and pulpy. Creton a tartiner was finer than those served at Cabin a Sucre. Les oeufs a la Mexicaine de Simon Durivage, looked like the a daisy; the yellow fluffy egg in the centre of the flowered shaped bowl.

A dinner at Europea is by no means just a meal, but it's an interactive experience, akin to something like Alinea in Chicago (or so I've heard) and Blue Hill Stone Barns which I can attest to. We started with crispy cheesy ""cigars"", infused with notes of fragrant truffle, which seemed to be the theme in the beginning. Following the amuse bouche was another one that can only be described as a delicious bite of a ball of truffle and cheese; I literally just popped the entire thing in my mouth like a bubble gum. And the other courses of the tasting menu kept coming - a thick and scrumptious lobster soup in a cappuccino-like presentation (also with hints of truffle), an Asian course of fresh sashimi, shrimp dumpling, and tasty seaweed, calamari cut into noodles harmoniously mixed into the yolks of poached quail eggs, hearty scallops with a generous puree sauce, a tiny dish (I think it was a small piece of salmon?) hidden in the inside of a gigantic book, a juicy helping of cornish hen that sat underneath a dome of ... something, not sure if that was edible, but basically I took a hammer and smashed it open, revealing the hen all tender and delectable. The savory part of the tasting menu can't be beat, but the dessert was fantastical, unique, and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The waiter brought a large ""tree"" made of black wire, embellished with giant fluffs of pink cotton candy; it took me back to carnivals I went to as a kid with the soft strands of sugar immediately melting in my mouth. Hanging from the ""branches"" were wrapped goodies, ranging from apple-flavored marshmallows and jelly-filled cookies and macaroons - all absolutely amazing. There's more! We put whatever sweets we couldn't finish into a large Chinese takeout box, already filled with orangey petite madeleines (sigh ... yummm). And wait - there's even more! The waiter brought over a giant meringue, wrapped in cellophane, like a gift, which would have been perfect with morning coffee, but we unfortunately left that behind. Nonetheless, it indeed gets an A in my book for the exquisite food, attentive servers, classy ambience, and innovative experiences. Note that I haven't mentioned all the components of the meal, which means you'll just have to go and see for yourself! Enjoy!"

I judge a restaurant by food (includes taste, freshness, creativity with ingredients and presentation), service and ambience. I came here during lunch with my wife, and knew it had good ratings on trip advisor, but wanted to see for myself. This restaurant is booked up about 10 days in advance, so I was able to get a lunch reservation because of a cancellation. My wife and I got there 20 minutes early, they checked my reservation and escorted us to a table right away. The service was phenomenal. We had the Maitre'D and 2 servers waiting on us. They came out with Maple cured beef jerky and goat cheese lollipops, with truffle popcorn as a welcome appetizer. It was great! We ordered a combination of things... the Calamari was sliced to resemble noodles and was so tender and tasty. I got the mushroom and chestnut soup... amazing! We both got the scallops with root vegetables as the entree; the bitterness of the root vegetables perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the scallops. At the end for dessert, I got the chocolate and pistachio truffle and my wife got the Creme Brûlée... both were done wonderfully.The combination of the culinary surprises, and the wonderful flavors in those dishes, married with the service gives this place 5 stars in my book. A must visit. We probably indulged too much, and had several cocktails, which set the bill high, but if we had one glass of wine a piece, the price would have been about $100... which is about what we spend in NYC for a meal that's not equal at all.An absolute gem of a find, and if you have the opportunity to go there, you will not be let down!"

Surprisingly the chicken was actually really moist and tender and probably the best dish.

/user_details?userid=xSvaAzk3GXnW0LzanVAUUg,Thomas P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went there with my girlfriend for our 5th anniversary and I must say it was quite an experience. From the moment we sat down we were taken care of, and they keep serving you little portions of different dishes throughout the dining experience. I found that extremely smart, as we never had a moment when we were just waiting for food. You get to try a bunch of different things too so I would definitely recommend this place to foodies.The food itself was just excellent. Every little portion we got to try was delicious (in particular the lobster cappuccino and the blue cheese lollipops), and our main courses were divine. My girlfriend got the hen, and it was some of the best chicken she's ever had. It is cooked in a clay pot, and a waiter showed up with a hammer and told her she would have to break the clay with it before they would put the dish itself on a plate for her. She thought that was awesome and promptly destroyed it. :)Dessert was equally impressive, as was the selection of wines. It is definitely an expensive place, but for a one time experience I think it was worth every penny."

Food was incredible and well presented in an entertaining way (one of the reasons why I booked here as I read reviews of the interesting way the food is presented plus a few surprises). Upon entering the restaurant, we were treated special and given the ""chef's table"" downstairs which overlooks the chef's kitchen. Initially I thought the setup was strange and unromantic (facing the kitchen instead of each other), but it actually ended up being really good and was entertaining to watch the chefs in action! Only comment is perhaps the kitchen could be more aesthetically pleasing/fancier and also I felt a bit cautious as the stairs were directly above me (people walk above you) and was afraid dirt would fall on top of me/my food. Thank you for a great night out in Montreal!!"

That's the only thing I can say after eating there for the first time followed by when am I going back. The service is great and the food is incredibly good. For those that comment saying that there was no flavor, either you had a cold and could not taste anything or you've burned all of your taste buds and can't taste anything. The lobster cappuccino is insane. First you taste the cream on top and all of a sudden you get the rich lobster flavor. The foie gras, pintade And desserts were all amazing."

/user_details?userid=DY95NdqXaLqdaNM0qIHCpw,Guy C.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"(see explanation of ratings below)5 of 5 stars (excellent, fine dining).One of the most memorable meals of our lives.  Huge emphasis on creative showmanship and presentation.About $90 per person, one cocktail each, no dessert, tax (15%) included, gratuity not included.Allow 2.5 hours for the smaller of the two price fixe menus.Simply wonderful event from start to finish. We had about six amuse bouches including:-Cheese ""lollipops"" with truffle popcorn-jerky on a clothesline-cheese ""cigars""-mini corn muffins-book of smoking smoked salmon-assorted mini dessertsGreat service and very good sommelier, Jack Grimaudo. About my ratings:Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):1) fast food and ""fast-casual"", low-priced (no table service).2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."

/user_details?userid=OPtv-lFAgcddoUuHCcTHUQ,Chris S.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"Words cannot describe the truly unique journey you go through on their tasting menu. I'm not even going to try. It is a show, an experience, and a memory that will last for decades.So I will say this:We paid $99/ea for the 12 course tasting menu, another $64 for 5 wine pairings. To me that is a lot of money for dinner. I think this is one of the most expensive meals I have ever had. It is WORtH EVERY PENNY though, In fact sitting back and reflecting I would value the meal I received that night at $450 per person. No joke, if tomorrow they increased the price to $299 for the 12 course meal and wine went to $149 I wouldn't even hesitate pulling out my American Express. They would deserve it. The food is so incredible and the service exquisite. I have never felt so highly valued. I think we had 3-4 waitstaff taking care of us. I tipped 45% and felt they deserved more.This place is so good I am going to take my wife and fly non-stop from San Francisco to Montreal, have dinner and stay the night and fly back the next day. This restaurant is truly world class. It surpassed my every expectation and I will be back annually for anniversaries and/or very special occasions."
/user_details?userid=0m27-mxjtEtWXQup_9QofA,C. T.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"CAVEAT: We came on high recommendations from our friends who have always gotten great suggestions from so perhaps our anticipations caused some of the let down.Tried the $99 tasting menu, it was packed full of surprises and creative presentation of food, but while some items stood out as amazing, some were not quite at the standard we would expect at such an establishment.  Overall the dishes were solid and I do appreciate the effort put into the meal, but I really did not expect some of the disappointments from a top-scale fine dining restaurant...Personal Highlights:*Lobster cream Cappuccino with truffle puree*Tagliatelle of lemony calamari. Poached quail egg, squid ink and garlic butter croutons*Maple bark stewed pan-seared foie gras, caramelized on a river stone with ice wine. Cloudberry cannelé (be prepared, the portion is huge, probably twice the size of what you'd normally expect to see)*Pina Colada (pineapple puree, coconut foam, rum jelly...so delicious, perhaps the best part of desserts for me)Disappointments:*The surprise starting treats (truffle popcorn, goat cheese lollipop...etc) were enticing to the eye, but the bits that were suppose to be crispy were all crunchless and a bit soggy.*Wild Sockeye salmon cooked in breakable clay -- the presentation was fun and concept of clay baking was intriguing, but our salmon was way overcooked, which was such a let down!*Cornish hen cooked in hay-lined pot -- Again, loved the concept and presentation, but the hen was way overcooked and dry. The hen broth infused with galangal was delicious though, but it could not save what essentially tasted like bland overcooked chicken breasts...such a shame!We did the prestige wine pairing, which was nice, but in hindsight, I'm not sure if we might have done better trying other wines.  Pairing the Krug with the fois gras was a lovely touch, but not sure if that justified the $125 price tag if you aren't dazzled by the Krug. Of the 5 wines, the VPZ Catalan, Cuvée ""FERNAND VAQUER"" 1991, was nice enough, but stood out to be more disappointing of the choices, instead of ""smokey nose with notes of fig"" ours reminded me more of a tawny port, perhaps its harder to control quality for these older vintages.Overall, if you have never been and would like an evening of creative fine dining in Montreal, I recommend still Europea. I would, however, skip the signature tasting and opt for the  $69pp ""Table d'hôte découverte"" (still has a bunch of surprises), and unless you love some Krug, there's no need to go for the ""prestige"" pairing.  Our friends came on different night when the head sommelier, Jack Grimaudo was in the house, they found him to be extremely knowledgeable and engaging.  Unfortunately, we had a different sommelier on our evening and he seemed rather unenthusiastic about describing the pairing choices or in answering any questions."

In Jan 2019 I had dinner at their new location and had one of the most terrible restaurant experiences. First off, I had to wait to be seated for 30 minutes after making this reservation two months in advance. We were offered to order drinks while we were waiting. I never received my drink in all my 30 minutes of waiting. I did not receive my drink until 15 minutes after being seating (45 minutes). Then I was seated at a table that was located right next to where they stack dirty dishes and trays. We requested to move. The perks on dining at Europe's were gone, like the ""cigar of cheese"" lobster cappuccino, and cotton candy trees. They have also lost their exquisite ambience and replaced it with a terrible throw back to the mid 1990's with their bare white walls and red roses. By the time I got my food, the lobster and pasta was cold. Overall this restaurant has gone from my favorite restaurant to easily the biggest dissapointment and let down in all of my dining experiences. I will never go back."

/user_details?userid=cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,Ephraim D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The restaurant is beautiful and classy from the moment that you walk in. They took our coats and seated us promptly. The table on the top floor near the stairs bounced from time to time as people walked heavily. The presentations were beautifully prepared, the wine menu was extensive. The presentations were fun, but I was more interested in the underlying food. The popcorn was too old and hard, the cigars too salty, the smoke from the salmon box was delightful. The butters were interesting and the bread fresh but overly crusty. The clafoutis was served in an incredible little dish. The foie gras was good but not the best that I have ever had, the caramelization was a bit too deep, the canele didn't have the crisp exterior, though the cloudberry was nice. The veal cheek was incredibly beefy in flavour, the potatoes on top were wonderful. Dessert was beautiful to behold but not as sweet as I would have liked. The champagne macaron didn't really have a great champagne flavour, but the macaron was well made.Do this for the experience. The delights of having different plates put in front of you with interesting containers. It's a beautiful presentation and the service."

I have been to Europea for the supper time service as well but I find it a better value to go at lunch time. Just to give you an idea, the last time we spent $500 for two people at the supper time service - but you get what you pay for :) Worth every penny!"
/user_details?userid=11V_zUrpadPKvPQpQ-Ctiw,Kate L.,"Bellevue, WA",2 star rating,"The evening started off great! Great service and the amuse bouche and the small dishes in between the courses were unique and tasted so good. The lobster cappucino was delicious. My husband was happy with the wines he tried. We really liked the panna cotta that was served with the other little desserts at the end.Where they lost points was the the slide in service once they got busy. We purposely came at 6:00 pm, knowing it would take at least 2 hours for dinner, which I don't mind because I didn't expect anything different from a high end restaurant. We don't like to feel rushed. Back to when they got busy....the attention was lacking once we hit our main course. Main course was a disappointment in comparison to the flavours and presentation of dishes prior to. I tried their lobster and sweetbreads, which was not bad, but the flavours were a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly, but the flavour of the dish wasn't great. My husband ordered his steak medium-rare, but it came medium-well to well. We would have indicated this had we been checked on. But alas, our server did not come around until he had already finished the meal to ask how everything was. When we mentioned about the steak, he basically said ""oh, ok"". That's it. I would expect a place like this would offer some type of compensation (I'm not expecting a free meal or anything, but at least offer something to keep a patron happy).  That was one point lost there.Then, there was my husband's entree (appetizer). He had ordered the scallop with radish ravioli. The menu suggested it was an XXL scallop. When it came out, it was more like a medium sized scallop, which would be ok had they not said XXL. Another point lost.Finally, they mentioned on the menu that you can ask for a tour of their kitchen. I was interested in this and asked about it just before the main. Server said they'd be delighted and will speak to his manager to arrange this. At the end of our meal, we just received our bill and he said have a nice evening. I expected more for what you paid, so another point docked.This place really had great potential, but fell short in certain areas that cannot be overlooked for a place you're paying $300 for two people. We've definitely had better experiences elsewhere. We would give it another try, but probably wait a few years as their menu choices are pretty limited and doesn't seem to change. Tip: If you don't want to go all out with the tasting menu, go for ordering off the regular menu and not the Table d'hote. You get the same experiences either way with the small dishes in between. The only difference is you get a dessert with the Table d'hote (which wasn't great and you basically pay regular price for it). Also, the options for the main under the Table d'hote is limited. I didn't have the Table d'hote and just ordered the foie gras for entree and lobster and sweetbreads as the main."

/user_details?userid=vVnevUg9jJbMxh3d7MgzYA,Scott K.,"McLean, VA",1 star rating,"Dear Europea,Judging from the other Yelp reviews, we are in the minority on this one, but we were immune to your charms.In the middle of a wonderful stay in Montreal, we were looking forward to dinner with you after an excellent meal at another restaurant in town.You tried really, really hard to impress. We know. The whole experience seemed designed to surprise and delight with a parade unexpected wonders. But for us, it quickly collapsed into a humorous show that distracted from enjoyment of the food itself.Our advice? Less is more. A small handful of the below litany of flourishes, if done well, would have been far more enjoyable.Here are some specific thoughts on our experience.AMBIANCEThere was a lot going on with the interior, which was broken into many smallish rooms and areas. Each table was cluttered with no less than a glossy stone cairn, a rose in a glass and a candle, in addition to the flashy place settings.AMUSE-BOUCHES, ETC. - the fanfare of surprise bits of food & fun included:* Two tiny pieces of dried, flavorless meat hanging inexplicably from a toy clothesline.* Truffle popcorn in a black construction paper cone stuck oddly in a bowl of salt along with two goat cheese + crunch somethings in the form of lollipops.* The dramatic hot water on the expanding hand & face towlette capsule presented in a miso soup spoon.* The lobster cream cappuccino was the exception. It was delicious and easily the best part of the meal. It was flavorful, light and rich all at the same time. Wonderful.* A bizarre box in the form of a fake book, filled with smoke and containing a single forgettable salmon h'orderve.* A frozen mist of something intended to clean your palate before the main course. Two bowls of it arrived on a platter which also boasted the enchanting bowl of steaming dry ice!* After dinner, the overexertion continued with the ""pre-dessert"" featuring:        o A metal tree structure festooned with tufts of pink cotton candy and hanging with candy wrapped in cellophane tied to the branches. The base sported macaroons and other things.        o Two chocolate-and-something lollipops fixed to the bottom of a stone bowl with edible glue.        o A Chinese food container (?) with mini-madeleines and gummy treats.        o Cups of custard.        o A giant cellophane-wrapped merengue with a Europea sticker.Every table was subjected to the exact same stream of gimmicks burped out of the production line, from the postage stamp-size dried meat, to the smoky box, to the cotton candy tree. At one point we smelled the smoke and knew instantly where the other table was in the order of events without even looking - cool! The used smoky boxes sat stacked and sad-looking on a side table. The cotton candy trees waited impatiently next to them in rows, ready to be served.ENTREEI ordered the Cornish hen prepared in a clay pot. I expected an entire fist-size bird with delicious flavor and nicely browned skin. My Cornish hen arrived at the table sealed in its clay pot on a silver platter. I was then given the ""honor"" of breaking the clay pot with my very own hammer! Silly. They then took the broken pieces back to the kitchen and reemerged with the prepared plate containing two pale pieces (breasts?) of meat on a bed of potato puree, vegetables, etc. The pieces seemed too large for a Cornish hen and the flavor was bland and forgettable.My dinner partner ordered the red risotto with shrimp and beets. In hindsight, the name of the dish gave us fair warning, but we weren't expecting a bloody red mass on the plate. It was tastier than the Cornish hen but disturbing to have THAT much red glaring at you.After the red scare and the ""pre-dessert"", we skipped actual dessert and went home disappointed."

We got a very nice and friendly call backfrom the restaurant stating that someone has cancelled their reservation and that we could take their 6pm reservation.When we first got there the exterior looked very nice it had 2 levels but we were guided to walk towards the upper levelOnce we walked it we were greeted by the hostess who offeredto check in our coats, and then we were guided to our table upstairs.Beautiful view we had right beside of the stairs that was next totheir wine cellar, and our waiter was kind to explain the menu to us.We are from Toronto and not all of the waiters/waitress took time toexplain how their menus work so therefore we were really happy he did.We both picked different menus, my husband had the signature tastingmenu for $109.50 and I had the Table d'hote Discovery for $79.50the main difference between mines and my husbands choice was obviously with the signature tasting he had more dishes and for mines i had fullsize apps and entree.To start off our experience, it was just as our server said it willbe interesting, we had very cute amuse-boche's !! Just like the photos shown on the site, we had the pesto and cheeselollipops, with popcorn, homemade beef jerky, cheese cigars, and one moreitem that looked like biscuits with olive oil, and fried chips !ALL OF THE AMUSE BUSCHE WAS GOOOD !!!! hands down ! it came quick thohahah a bit to quick because they advise us that due to differentitems that we are getting etc that timing in between meals would be offwhich is fine, because me and my husband love to share food.( forgot to mention they had risotto truffle balls ( OMG GOOD )Overall the presentation of the food were like art presented, andit was very creative and modern innovated. We liked how we were very interactive with our food, and how they explained every detailfrom how it's cooked to the components on our plate.Dessert was a very cute and romantic feeling for me personallyit had cotton candy in the shape of a ball on a display with tree branches, and they had little candies/sweets in individualpackages hung on the tree just like the photos you see. It's sucha cute thing we also had a little take away box to put in our sweetsif we couldn't finish.At the end of our wonderful meal we met John ! Wonderful man whoexplained more about the restaurant and offered to show us the kitchen.You can see the passion he has with his job and the pride of the restaurant.It makes every customer feel like they are just at home even when travellingand that your in good care when your dining with them.Overall I can go on forever if you can see with this very extensive reviewI would recommend this restaurant to everyone and all of my friendsin Toronto and I look forward to coming back soon !"

/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Europea Restaurant fed us what may be one of the most memorable meals we'll ever have. If I were to list all of the food they brought us (it's so much more than what you order) this review would be a few pages long, so I'll resist and give you what you need to know. This is a beautiful restaurant - very classy and romantic setting. The service is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, polite and patient (describing dishes again and again) and our server was also hilarious, with a very dry sense of humour. Not all of the food ranks with the most delicious I've ever had, though it's all very tasty, but the creativity and artistry with which it's presented is... well it's just really something else. Once you've had a book that lets out a cloud of fragrant wood smoke brought to you to find a single piece of gravlax on lemon cream in a pastry shell inside, you can't really think of a cooler way to have salmon served to you. Favourite dishes of the many we were brought were the tagliatelle of calamari and the lobster cream cappuccino. The madeleines and macarons we were served with dessert were also exceptionally good. This is a very pricey night out, but even at this cost going once is worth it if you can appreciate experiencing food as a total sensory experience rather than based on taste alone. If you are all about big portions of delicious food (and I can definitely appreciate that), this might not be the restaurant for you, but I'm so glad that we got to go."

Long story short, He stopped me rudely yesterday around 6pm, and ask me to wipe the pee that my dog left, 5 meters away from their restaurant door, on the Public walkway, when We passed by. This is just ridiculous and unacceptable. 1) my dog was not peeing on the door nor the long carpet in front of your door, but on the de la montagne street. 2) de la montagne street is a public street not your private property. 3) he was just actually posing as a normal dog always does, since he already finished his job mostly and we were waking back home (I'm living on the same street 30 meters away). 4) you were asking me to stop a dog from peeing on a street??? Seriously????"

The dessert plates came out like a tree with cotton candy as the bushes and cookies and macarons in little bags hung from the branches. Overall, it was awesome. I've never been to a restaurant like this and the setting was really pretty and moderately quiet. It is a really good place to take somebody out for a date!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ahh...was ALMOST 5/5...I'll explain why I gave this place a 4 belowSo, I needed a good place to bring my fiance to for his birthday. Something classy yet romantic. New and exciting yet delicious. Friends referred me to Europea, saying that although the food isn't worth what you pay for it, the overall experience is. So, wanting to pamper my fiance, off to Europea we went!Upon entering, we were happy with the ambience and the nice reception we were greeted with. We were seated in a secluded area of the restaurant upstairs - something I was grateful for. We looked at the menus, and quickly made our decision. Fiance was to take the 12 course tasting menu, and I would take the table d'hote with the fois gras for an extra $12. A half bottle of wine for $45 was also decided on (yes, 45 is a bit much for less than 12oz of wine......).So, I won't go into ALL the details regarding the food, but I will say that we were really happy with all the ""surprises"" from the kitchen ranging from cheese lollipops and cigars to charcuterie hung from a wire by a clothespin to little sponge cakes from bordeaux and more. We were also very pleased with the presentation of all the food. Sure, they could have just put everything in bowls and on plates, but they went above and beyond to be as creative as possible when serving food.The staff was very friendly and accommodated our requests, and although at times I wondered if it was too expensive, I decided that the service surpassed ANY restaurant I've been to in North America, and so it was fine.My only tiny piss off was the fact that the fois gras I paid an extra $12 for was kind of gross. My fiancee gladly ate it (although the same thing was to be brought to him a few courses later). What we did instead was ask the waiter if it was possible to remove the $12 charge and simply not bring my fiance his portion. We were told that this wasn't possible. Seeing as to how I did order it, I gladly accepted that. The problem for me was when the waiter came around 2 minutes later and apologetically asked me if he could bring me a different appetizer instead (one that was part of my table d'hote). I said sure and when he asked me what I wanted, I told him to bring whatever (assuming that it was for free since he was the one who proposed). So, he brought me a bison tartare which was to DIE for. However, I must admit that I felt VERY ripped off when the bill came, and I was charged an extra $20 for this appetizer on top of the $70 table d'hote and the $12 fois gras bringing my THREE course meal to be more expensive than my fiance's TWELVE course meal!!! I didn't fuss about it because I didn't want to put a dent in our good night, but that move definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Up until then, I was saying that I would definitely go back, but now I'm not so sure.All in all, it was a cool experience. Would I go back?? Unfortunately no, but definitely give it a try! (I mean after all, who doesn't love cotton candy with dessert??) I'm really sad our waiter had to put that crappy move on us..otherwise, I'd be making reservations right now for next weekend! :|"

The Europea team definitely deserves a four-star rating for effort as they did try their best to present themselves as a five-star restaurant, but unfortunately that was the exact theme for the night.... "" To Try."" Yoda would not be pleased. Everything from the service to the endless stream of courses upon courses had the definite perception of trying to emulate a high-end gourmand experience, but unfortunately they never succeeded in fully convincing. The decor would have been befitting in a casual dining cafe, and crispy bacon hanging from from a rack... where have I seen that before? Dishes such as the lobster cappuccino and cornish hen smoked with hay were reminiscent of signature dishes at other better-known nouvelle establishments, but arguments on originality and creativity aside, nothing was a revelation to my taste buds. Classic case of quality over quantity - I would rather have been presented the set number of advertised courses that were executed to perfection over a myriad of so-so and ""almost-there"" bits that Europea elected to serve instead. Sadly, this is the only restaurant experience that I have actually been genuinely bored at - after about 9 courses and two bottles of wine we were ready to cut our losses and signaled the waiter for the bill. Montreal has too many restaurants serving French classics to justify spending it for mediocre haute cuisine at Europea. We had a fantastic time at other nearby restaurants with better food at a fraction of the price!"

The amuse bouches were nice but there were not many as some of us with allergies had our servings taken out without being offered anything else. Our orders were taken promptly and two plates of butter (not three) were brought but we had to wait and finally ask for the bread.The lobster and truffle cappuccino was nice but not memorable and my waitress spilled some of mine on the table, it was not cleaned nor replaced. We were also disappointed with the first wine that was served.The squid pasta was a nice play on texture but we enjoyed the foie gras most with the langoustine crunch and the wine that was served with it was very nice, we just wished there would have been ore than one tiny brioche with it.The beef was also good although I asked for saignant and got à point but it remained succulent.They had barely cleared our plates that the desserts came out. The madeleines were very good and the cotton candy was a nice touch but added nothing taste wise. The lemon verrine I found too heavy and none of us enjoyed the thick shard of sugar.Still for the price it is a good value for lunch, but I did not think service was great and we definitely were rushed to finish our meal."
/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"More in the blog - highlight dishes mentioned below:The Why: Jerrome Ferrer is kind of a big deal in and around Montreal -Relais & Chateaux, 4-Diamonds, and the praise of many gourmands follow his name and a place in the Chaine des Rotisseurs particularly caught my attention.  Admittedly a fan of fine dining with an agenda that otherwise included Quebecois staples of poutine, pigs feet, and as much maple syrup as I could find Europea seemed a perfect choice for my one solo night in Montreal - a good reason for the suit and tie as opposed to the Patrick Roy jersey, at the very least.The Service:  Whether it was my inability to speak French, the fact that I only ordered one glass of wine, or an effect of the fact that there was a large (14 or so) table of regulars seated directly behind me I will simply say that the service at Europea was lacking.  Twenty minute waits between courses, water unfilled for long periods of time, bread service unreplenished, and an inexplicable twenty minute wait at the end of the meal where not a single server walked within fifteen feet of my table (aside from up and down the stairs) to check in, refill coffee, or offer the bill.  I was an island of one in the dead-center of the restaurant for the majority of my visit - something I've never experienced at such a restaurant and hope to never experience again.  It was mentioned to the manager when I asked to see the kitchen at the end of the evening - he blew me off with an ""oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.""The Food:  $100 tasting menu, one $19 glass of ice wine, complementary canapes, amuses, mignardises, bread service, $4.50 coffee.Calamari - Tagliatelle of Calamari Carbonara:  With many chefs making squid noodles and turning everything into a haute carbonara I'll simply say this dish could have fallen way short for me, but in fact it was probably the best of the night in terms of innovation and execution as the tender squid was nearly indistinguishable from al dente pasta while the use of a poached Quail Egg, squid ink and garlic butter croutons, and lemon 'caviar' all melded into a bright and balanced sauce - I could have eaten a giant bowl of this and left happy.Foie Gras - Maple:  In a trip filled with fatty fowl liver this was probably the most memorable in terms of 'wow' factor as a thick slice of the lobe arrive previously smoked over maple wood and seared on one side only to be placed on a hot river stone tableside and doused with ice wine allowing it to caramelize under a glass dome as I watched and enjoyed a tasty cloudberry canale meant to 'whet the palate.""  Smoky and unctuous, sweet with a crystalline crust giving way to supple fat - I'd be hard pressed to name five better foie preparations in the last five years.Raviole - Fresh organic-herb ravioli stuffed porcini mushrooms:  Never afraid to serve up the bold flavors, this plate was the very essence of the earth and a perfect lead in to the final savory.  Featuring ""Seared Mushrooms picked by Mr Roberts"" including a woodsy cascade of Enoki, Shitake, Morels, Honshimiji, and Trumpets served alongside thin noodles stuffed with truffled Enoki puree the dish was completed with buttery morel mushroom froth with the smell greeting you at 10 feet and the flavor every bit as powerful; this plate also returned to the kitchen without a spot. The Verdict:  With the previously mentioned service flaws frequently marring the otherwise excellent cuisine and my comments about this blown off by the manager clearly tempering my feelings about a return to Europea I have to admit that on the whole the cuisine was quite goodt and at less than $100 before tax/tip (and converting to the US Dollar) Europea would not be out of place amongst the Michelin 1-Star restaurants of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco.  Certainly a bit of attention to detail would be welcomed, but taking into consideration the ravioli, squid noodles, and foie gras I cannot deny that the meal was a memorable one."

My wife and I recently went to Europea to celebrate a special occasion. I consider Jerome Ferrer to be one of the most premier chefs in Montreal. So needless to say that I've really been looking forward to eat there and had high expectations.We had the tasting menu, and as everybody previously mentioned,the service and presentation were intricate and impeccable, if not somewhat intimidating. Maybe that was the reason as to why I didn`t enjoy my experience as much as I would have wanted. I just never felt comfortable at my table. As for the food, I have to say that none of the dishes particularly struck me taste wise. There were no misses but there were also no dishes that will make me run back to this restaurant. The amuse-bouche and the vast array of desserts were most probably the best part. In all, a good meal but I may have set my expectations way too high. A good restaurant to come to on an expense account. Otherwise, there are other better tasting menus in the city."

(that said, the broth was fantastic). A smoked salmon canape in a box filled with smoke is cute but it tasted like it was made 2 days prior and seriously, it is 2012... canapes?   The most egregious problem with our meal was the wine pairing.  $65 for what was at most 6oz of wine.  We did not receive any wine until the 4th dinner item (how is this possible?).  Once we did, we had to miserly ration each sip to try to make it through the next course.   The wine service here is inexcusable.For a $450 tab for two people (including tip) I expect much more than this restaurant had to offer.   The night before we had an amazing meal for less than half the cost at Les Deux Gamins with a much more exciting atmosphere.  The reviews here are the most misleading I have ever experienced on Yelp and leads me to believe the reviewers only dine out on vacation. If you want whimsical mediocre food, this is the place for it."

Very cool...and tasty! The Cornish Hen breast baked in clay pot was just a touch dry but the delicious accompanying sauce more than saved it for Cheryl.

The lobster cappuccino has been done before and this version doesn't stand out. I ordered the steak medium rare. It came out medium well so I returned it. They offered to redo it but I decided it was not worth the wait. At this price point, this kind of mistake should not happen. The desserts were presented in unique ways but the taste was just okay.

We agreed that all the dishes were nicely presented. Here come the negatives: 1. be sure to take a pic of what you get. they somehow managed to forget to serve the lobster bisque to us. after we verify with the table next to us on how theirs were presented, we have to firmly state to our waiter that we never got it. finally, they asked the kitchen to make us the tasty lobster bisque (they call it capuccino).  2. my wife choose the halibut that was highly recommended. it was prepared over a bed of hay? even though the presentation was really unique, we rated the  fish 2/10. halibut that we had before were buttery and moist. somehow this one was way overcooked and not tender at all. never figured out what the hay did for the dish. to be fair, my entree, the veal cheek was much better. it was baked in clay which I was invited to break open with a hammer. the meat was tender and tasty but the potato crust on the veal steals the thunder. it was definitely better than the halibut. to finish the meal, there were many different sweets including several balls of cotton candy. in our opinion, it was a bit much, especially for aged folks like us. overall it is an experience but did not quite fulfill our French cuisine dream."

We had prosciutto served to us on mini clotheslines. Our Foie Gras was smoked on a piece of wood right on our plates. The best dish for me was the Lobster Cappuccino which was less of a cappuccino and more of a soup. I didn't know you can heighten the flavor of an already flavorful seafood but this chef did it. Last but not least, big thanks to our waiter (which I'm ashamed we forgot his name). It takes the chef's dishes and our waiter's dramatic delivery of each to make the experience so spectacular. The theatricality is really what makes this high-end place more enjoyable than others. It is very pricey --the most I've ever paid for a meal but you only live once."

I had some ""wow"" moments. You have to go to check it out. Like really, they will surprise you with something.Is it worth 95.50 bucks? Yes. Should I go back again? On special occasions only. I recommend it."

Too often, if you request a vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise non-standard option, restaurants will do little more than throw something together using that night's available ingredients (you are then stuck eating these improvisations, while the rest of your table enjoys a superior meal for the same price). It is very difficult to come by a meat-free dinner that is well-thought-out, well-executed, and creative, but this is where Europea did not disappoint. My husband and I ordered from both the vegetarian and regular dinner menus, and we were left very impressed. Thank you for a lovely night."

He described Europea as an unforgettable ""experience"", and that it wouldn't disappoint as a birthday dinner. And man was he right! Two best adjectives I could use for eating at Europea would be theatrical and inventive! There were tiny beef jerky hanging off a clothes line, cheese rolls inside a cigar box, and smoking appetizers in a book! I don't want to spoil anymore surprises but the 6 course meal was well worth the price. We left stuffed to the brim unable to even finish our several desserts. Everything was well thought out and service was prompt and tremendously attentive. I do recommend booking in advance--we went on a Wednesday night and it was fully booked! The waiter told us that weekend nights they're usually booked out 4 weeks in advance. And make sure you set aside at least 2 1/2 hours for the experience.

Europea on la Montagne St. We ordered the tasting menu from the front page.  Not inexpensive, but totally worth it The chef starts us off with yummy cheese lolly pops, a cone of popcorn infused with truffle oil (yum) and one of the coolest presentations I've seen in a long time, a ""clothes line"" of Venison Jerky. That's all before we even begin our ordered mealNext came a wonderful ""cheese stick"" and those words do not do justice to the food, or the presentation. Let's just say we thought we were being offered a cigar by the looks of it. But when the lid was opened, there lay our yummy treat. A mind blowing presentation of a finger napkin followed. Who knew?Next, a smoked salmon (with real, fresh smoke). It looked like an old antique book, until you lifted the lid, and wonderfully aromatic smoke billowed out. A lobster cream cappuccino with truffle followed Next a DimSum dish of raw Tuna with Black Sesami and a Shrimp dish with peanut cream. Oh my....Next was the calamari with poached quail egg and Squid Ink and Garlic Butter Croutons. Home made foie gras with shrimp something or other....wow, I'm not a big fan of foie gras, but this was amazing. Oh, did I mention the carrot, green apple and ginger smoothie that came with it?Sea Bass and Beet Root spaghetti follows with a very cool presentation. Next, a pallet cleanser ofYuzu Freezing Mist.

The food is absolutely delicious. Every course you could not ask for anything more delectable. My husband and I went here for a small trip to Montreal celebrating our wedding anniversary. This was literally one of the top three things about our entire trip. We were not expecting to have one of the best meals of our lives in Canada but we sure did at Europea.  It's also not just the five star food it's the entire dining experience. The wine list was also very very extensive and I appreciate that they had a wine connoisseur available to suggest what wines we should try.

It is simply an amazing experience and a wonderful way to spend a meal. My husband planned it for our anniversary and I was blown away.FOOD: It just kept coming! After we sat down the staff was very welcoming and would just bring us the most amazing things to sample. Some memorable items were: sun-dried tomato biscuits, delicate cheese ""cigars"", smoked salmon, truffle popcorn - it was all tasty and just the right quantity.TIP - I wouldn't get the tasting menu, we each just ordered an entrée and it was plenty of food. We spoke with other diners who got the full tasting menu and then were completely stuffed halfway through (but they all said EVERYTHING tasted great). I got the Cornish Game Hen and my husband got the steak - both were cooked to perfection and totally flavorful.PRESENTATION: The presentation of every course of food was extremely professional.  I mean, it was up to the quality of PerSe in NYC. The staff and chef really go above and beyond to make the dining experience unique. I have been to other restaurants where this was attempted and horribly executed (like Barton G in Miami) but here is was PERFECT!!DRINKS:  We each got a wonderfully made cocktail and split a bottle of wine which was the perfect amount.SERVICE:  Just incredible. Everyone who took care of us was super-professional and attentive. Our waiter even went outside in the rain and hailed a cab for us!

/user_details?userid=F91G4ijWdDYroLvCJjC3cg,Maki P.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"True, I don't know a lot about the dining scene in Montreal, but Europea far exceeded my expectations. Their lobster cappuccino is quite possibly the best thing I've eaten all year (the flavors, texture and presentation come together to create the perfect, cozy, luxurious experience) and the service is one of the most refined combinations of both friendly and attentive that I've yet experienced.Yes, some of the dishes could be construed as gimmicky (the prosciutto chips hanging on a clothesline were more fun and adorable than culinarily masterful), and the wines all start at a very high price point, but the hits and the overall experience more than make up for these hiccups-- especially at the extremely reasonable price at which their smaller tasting menu is offered. Every course, expected and unexpected, came with a fun twist (the smoked salmon canapé that arrived in a faux hardbound book infused with a savory woodsmoke that came floating out into my delighted face as I lifted the lid; the ""sunny side up egg"" that came for dessert that was actually a small poached peach surrounded by a coconut champagne emulsion) and every detail, from the trio of creative butters that accompanied our bread to the bite-sized freshly baked chocolate madeleines that we received to take home, was beautifully soignee. I don't want to write too much more as for me, a large part of the joy of the evening was the element of playfulness and surprise throughout-- all I can say is that I would highly recommend Europea to anybody who is delighted by a unique and memorable dining experience!"

/user_details?userid=B4Rwp0SUYwO8lgSHVT9w5g,Amol P.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Having dined at Michelin establishments in Europe, I have to admit that this comes pretty close to deserving at least a star if not more. We were visiting montreal for the weekend and had already made reservations couple of weeks ago. Reservations seem extremely hard to come by at a convenient time, so reserve early to avoid disappointment. As soon as we were seated the food mostly in tapas style started arriving. It was presented in a quirky way especially the prosciutto chips hanging on a clothesline. Some dishes did not hit the mark from a taste perspective but scored high marks on culinary genius and creativity. The initial barrage of tapas left me in a food coma and I was not quite sure how much capacity I had left in me to get to the main part of the meal. They offer 2 different tasting menus and I think it's a great value for the price, we chose the smaller of the 2 tasting menus. We were served by different servers throughout our meal and I only had issues with one of them since they did not handle my cocktail request very well. HighlightsLobster cream Cappuccino with truffle - How can you not like this combination? I was salivating the minute I saw this dish on the menu.Goat cheese lollipops with parmesan - Heavenly, need I say more !Scallops - Delicious crust and the risotto was a perfect pairing with the earthiness of the mushroomsRavioli - We cleaned up this plate upto the last tiny morsel!DisappointmentsMaple bark stewed pan-seared foie gras, caramelized on a river stone with ice wine - This is a test of patience especially when the end product doesnt meet your expectations. The presentation is fun and you have to wait for the foie gras to cook itself on the hot stone. Unfortunately the temperature of the stone was higher than necessary which had an overall impact on the flavors I could taste. I think their earlier combination with mushrooms looks more appealing to me.The dessert was presented in a creative way (like a fried egg) but from a flavor perspective it did not pack a sweet punch. If you looking for a fun and adventurous dining experience, look no further than Europea. They change their menu every season, I can't wait to go back in the fall or spring to try out the inventive cuisine."

The staff is formal, the table and wall decorations are Asian, and the music is casual and pop. The food focuses way too much on trying to be novel in appearance and doesn't seem to focus enough on flavor. We ordered the 12 course dinner tasting menu and most were very average in flavor but two that were beet based were actually gross. The first few courses were rushed and our server kept trying to hurry us and then the last few we were forgotten about. It took almost an hour to get one of the dishes. We had 2 servers during the course of our dinner. The first was very friendly even if rushing us but the second server who was bald was extremely rude and condescending. We had questions about wine pairing and he was extremely curt and abrupt. Although he seemed much friendlier to the French speaking patrons. Overall I would not recommend this place.

/user_details?userid=Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ,Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"It can be a challenge finding a good place to eat on a Monday night, since so many fine dining restaurants are closed. We had hoped to try Toqué! but they were closed both nights we were in town. Europea was open and we were able to get reservations, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant has an elegant interior, and the night we were there it was mostly a business crowd, so we felt slightly underdressed. We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The menu is inspired by Québec's fresh produce. Presentation was excellent on all of the dishes; if I hadn't been to a place like this before I would have been more impressed, but we were a little underwhelmed as we've had better in LA (most recently at Gordon Ramsay), especially for the price. But it was still very good. As best as I can remember, our courses were as follows:Amuse bouche: goat cheese mousse with risotto and baconLobster cream cappuccino with truffle oilPrincess scallops, prepared in the shell with morel mushroom milk, sea water emulsion, parsnip puréeDuo of pan seared and torchon foie grasLight C02 foam prepared with César saladSurf & turf (medallion of milk fed veal with a crust of herbs pesto, langoustine ravioli with confit tomatoes, sautéed girolles mushroomsCheese plate2 dessert coursesThe desserts were extremely elaborate. Our first dessert course included panna cotta and a huge 3-tiered tray of bite-sized desserts, including maple marshmallow, chocolate-covered orange rind, chocolate-covered strawberries, apricot jelly pistachio tart, etc. Our second dessert course included a chocolate pot de crème with espresso foam and butterscotch ice cream.Probably my favorite dishes were the scallops and the langoustines, and my least favorite was the veal, which was slightly overcooked for our more bloody tastes. Foam was used in several dishes (it is molecular gastronomy after all), which may be a little gimmicky but I'm not complaining - actually the caesar salad foam dish was fairly interesting, and the foam that came with the scallops was an excellent complement. For our cheese course a large table of cheeses was brought out, from which we got to choose 4, so we chose all of the local Québec cheeses that they offered. The wine pairings were somewhat uninspired in our opinion, but we did enjoy the Barolo that was served with our surf & turf course, and I appreciated that they served a local Canadian sweet wine with the foie gras course rather than the traditional Sauternes. There were only 4 wines served with the 9 courses, which on the one hand comes across as not enough, but on the other hand it was nice to still be fairly sober at the end of the meal.  Personally I don't need to go back anytime soon, but it was a good dinner overall, and it seemed like a good place for a business dinner or a date if you've got money to spend."

To be honest with you, at this point in time I was so full, I had trouble enjoying desert.Overall there was nothing BAD about my experience at Europea.  There were some very strong points (the venue, a couple of the dishes, a couple of the wines) and a couple weak points (service, a couple of the dishes, a couple of the wines).  Unfortunately, given the menu prices at Europea, a mixed review will not suffice.  If I spend $400 on a meal for two, I expect to be blown away, and I wasn't.  I honestly can't say that I'll ever go back, so I just can't bring myself to recommend them.  Maybe your experiences will differ, but I think for this price range, there are better options in Montreal.Note:  if you ARE going to Europea, keep in mind that there is a ""Best Western Europa"" with the same color blue sign one block down on Drummond St, literally back to back with Europea.  If you find yourself at Europa, take a left into the alley just past the hotel, and when you come out onto Rue de la Montagne, Europea will be immediately on your left."

The ingredients are very fresh... all around it is exceptional.But the best is the Dessert, a macaron, ice cream, mousse cake, chocolate sauce, some coffee sprinkles, then as you're eating, they bring out mini madeleines fresh from the oven, then a few minutes later they come out with cotton candy, then a whole slew of mignardise like jellies and little chocolates and what not... i mean dessert was a little canival of sweets that will really appeal to your inner-child... really it made me feel like a kid again... It is the best dessert experience I've ever had!!!We were in love with this place, and the hostess even gave us a tour of the place, got to see the kitchen and the pastry kitchen, yep two separate kitchens it was a cool place to go, also it's a very noce romantic place, good choice to bring a special someone you want to impress..."

/user_details?userid=Rzw9TMaNdOUPH2PHAF47Yg,Juliana C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,The food presentation was unbelievable and the service was great. They were very attentive and entertaining. This really was the best experience I ever had at a restaurant. The reason why I only gave this place 4 stars is how I felt rushed while eating and the uninteresting taste to the interesting combinations of ingredients. The flavour wasn't spectacular. I would probably not come back since I live in Toronto and it's hard to make a reservation for here but I would definitely recommend you try this place at least once!
/user_details?userid=bh3KpLgAGO-myZe7umdciw,Debbie P.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,The 9 course tasting menu was heaven. Simply one of the best French fusion restaurants in Montreal. Seating is limited and reservations are required but you won't be disappointed with the food or service. They have an extensive wine list as well. This restaurant feels much more intimate than Toque since it's more dimly lit and there are several floors to the restaurant vs. a big open space. It's definitely worth the splurge!
/user_details?userid=JztkfbTDyTd66ZIZzwVblA,Allen K.,"Durham, NC",5 star rating,"Best meal ever. PeriodGot the tasting menu. Subtle tastes using all parts of the palate  Starts with the butter for the bread (was given 4 different ones) and ends with the deserts. Presentations are interesting but conservative and do not overwhelm the food itself. In the case of the smoked rib, it augments it (see photo-thats a glass serving dish with smoke in it, when the waiter takes off the top, you get a wiff of smoke, which starts gets everything going. Service was outstanding also. You will not be disappointed. Make reservations in advance."

We were expecting a fantastic meal, but were quickly let down as soon as we walked in. At first, we were seated at the table down the hallway from the bathrooms. I could hear doors slamming and dishes clanking behind me for the first 15 minutes. I spoke with the hostess and she graciously offered to seat us at a less distracting table upstairs. We hoped for an improved experience. Overall, the waiters were very friendly and poised, and I appreciated the creativity behind many of the small bites in between meals. The food just wasn't that good. For example, my entree of scallops with risotto was overcooked and tasted like fish food. The service was so slow that our three course meal lasted a good 3.5 hours. The meal was overpriced for the quality of the food and the outdated and worn decor. It was as though the rooms had not been touched since the artsy 90s. Overall, our recommendation is don't do it."

We were referred by the concierge at our hotel and had not heard of the restaurant before. I read the Yelp reviews for some background and can say that they were pretty much all 100% spot on. Here are some observations from our meal;  - Arrived and were seated upstairs in a far back room (behind the naked lady statue :). This is a great quiet room, especially as the restaurant filled up.  - Receiving a note from the chef is a great touch...  - Service was flawless, couldn't have been better.  - My wife ordered a Sea Bass Entree and a I ordered the prix fix menu with Scallops. Both of us had the Calamari appetizer.  - The waiter helped us choose a wine and did a great job.  - The Calamari appetizer was unbelievable, both in taste, but also in preparation. It really *is* linguine, but it is calamari... I'm still amazed.  - The scallops were really good, but so were the lemon.dill, chive potatoes and the caramelized endive.  - I'd suggest passing on expensive after dinner drinks... very few things pair well with cotton candy, certainly not Port. The little sweets that make up ""pre-desert"" were really great..   - My wife ordered a dessert I can only call ""ball of chocolate with ice cream, bananas and hot mango sauce. The server poured the mango over the ball and it dissolved into a plate full of deliciousness... that was an amazing thing to see, really the highlight of an amazing meal."

The food was somewhat bland (I feel like I am committing a huge sin writing that).  I has scallops for my main course and it was... short on flavor?  The desert (besides the extra sweets and cotton candy and, and ,and...) was a spin on eggs and hash brown. No one around the table I think liked it!  At that point we were all full so no one said much.  Weird textures, weird taste, it just did not work.  My wife had the foie gras that was cook on a heated stone with maple flavor or vapors under a glass dome.  Spectacular but the foie gras was essentially raw and aaaaa... well a bit slimy.  We both love foie gras but this was weird.For the rest, the calamari carbonara was yummy, the lobster cappuccino like nothing you ever had, and on and on.  So I am torn.  I think I will have to go again.  On the other hand, so many other places to try and so little  time."

It was a tough choice between the other contenders...and there are so many good choices in Montreal. But i only had limited time and money. So, here it goes. SERVICE was 5 stars....our experience was very positive from every staff member. i forgot to mention, i went with my wife and 6yr old daughter.. we ordered Ala carte for our daughter, while my wife and i had the tasting menu. They still brought out some soup, amuse bouche and desserts for FREE for my daughter. They were Very friendly, accommodating to my daughter and attentive to our needs. They anticipated every need...water was never empty or low, offered more wine when my drink was low, silverware replaced consistently, chef Ferrer comes out to greet us, Host comes by to check our satisfaction, the wait between dishes was well paced and presented well, and our jackets were waiting for us when we are about to leave the restaurant. No attitude, and very generous. Ambiance- The restaurant was very nice and tasteful....it feels very romantic, clean and well designed. 4-stars for this. FOOD- unfortunately, after eating at other heavy hitting places....the food here seemed pretty average. So 3 stars for this..... Everything was good....but the flavor is rather average...nothing really blew my mind. So, blow by blow account.... Bread/butter - 4-5 kinds of bread....but all of them seem to be the same kind. i had the olive bread and fig bread. It was a bit salty also. Parmesan crisp lollipop- nice texture. lobster cappuccino- i was expecting a thick lobster bisque...but i guess that is not the point in calling it cappucino...coz' it really had the consistency of coffee. its good and light...and would be better if he pronounced the truffle more. Foie gras- Awesome! this was done perfectly...and i love this preparation as well. Cod-this was good, very light, you can taste the flavor of the fish...has a bit of a mackerel flavor.Not sure what the sauce did...it was rich but not memorable. Mediterranean bass- this is basically sushi. Its good...but Im a big sushi fan, and Ive had better white fish than this...he should've used some truffle oil....and bring out the flavor more. giant scallop- again, this is another great dish that could use more flavor... bearnaise is just too bland and rich. cornwell chicken- great presentation, but very plain...very traditional. I wish he included some darkmeat and whitemeat to contrast the texture and flavor. Flavor is very clean and brings out the fresh chicken flavor. Fresh mushroom ravioli- love the truffle sauce! TRUFFLES!! i wish i had more of this... Smoked short ribs- wins best presentation by bringing it out in a smoked cover....but flavor was very typical...i wish he used pork belly instead....short rib could be more tender melt in your mouth...but it was very grainy. The galette of root vegetables also didn't work well with it... Cheese- not much selection...actaully, we didnt even choose...only 2 kinds were brought out with some nuts and jams...it was the perfect amount since we were getting full. Dessert was very good- probably the best part. It was simple and very familiar....frozen parfait, sugar coated marshmallow, macarons, sorbet with marangue...etc. Love them all! So, im not sure if im just jaded....but i would rate Europea in the middle. Not bad by any means....and i would love to return....The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality you get....it just did not show enough definition, or any stand out flavorto it....presentation gets all high marks...but it was just lacking in flavor...they played it too safe by sticking to a more traditional flavor range........the wine selection is very good,...i had a bordeau...which was fantastic.... and with the great service and staff...i think it gets a well deserving 4-star."
/user_details?userid=UE3mzZxiUx1PL-yMvqxKhw,Alexander B.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"I am not in the habit of leaving internet reviews, but I feel that the world needs to be warned about this restaurant: it is a gimmicky, gaudy, over-priced tourist trap.  As a preface, my girlfriend and I didn't actually end up eating very much food there - we actually just chose to leave after our drinks/appetizers and before paying several hundred dollars for what we surmised would be a horrible meal.  So, it is possible that the entrees at Europea are in fact very good, but I doubt it, and even if that is the case, the place is pretty tacky and dingy.  To put the review in context, my girlfriend and I are mid-20s Americans with what I'd call reasonably smart tastes in food and culture - we are not foodies etc., but I'd say we know bad food and a bad restaurant when we see it.We booked a reservation here after arranging a last minute trip to Montreal and were looking for a traditionally upscale French dinner to cap off our long weekend in the city.  Europea had great reviews on yelp and opentable, the menu looked good, it is run by a celebrity chef, we were staying a few blocks nearby and appeared to be in a location where you'd find good restaurants, so it seemed like an obvious choice.  Our first concerns emerged as we saw the neighborhood, which is the type of downtown area filled with taco bells, souvenir shops, strip clubs and, of course, tourist trap restaurants.  We decided to google image Europea to see what the inside looked like - judging from the photos online, it appeared to be a tacky restaurant, but we placed some trust in the glowing reviews on yelp and decided to show up for the reservation anyways.  We walked in to find the restaurant exactly as portrayed in the images - it looks like it was styled in the early 1990s and hasn't been renovated since.  Picture fake plastic neon colored plants, neon fluorescent lights on the bar, some 90s Euro techno music as light background music, dingy carpets, worn silverware and waiters in ill-fitting tuxedos.  Things didn't look good, but we still gave them the benefit of the doubt, and were seated by the hostess and ordered two martinis.  Our table was next to the staircase in the center of the restaurant and everything on it shook any time someone walked up or down the stairs. The martinis came as the host brought out some complementary appetizers: a small dried ""meat strip"" hanging on a tiny clothes hanger, garlic-olive bread sticks, some kind of pesto ""lollipop"" and truffle-cheese popcorn (I think?).  Each food item came with a little story about its preparation.  We took a sip of the martinis, which were gin and vodka respectively...they must have been 50% water, and to boot, were served in metal martini glasses with a comically large stick of olives across the top, so large in fact that we couldn't get the olives in the drink.  We then tried some of the small appetizers and it was impressively bad: the meat strip was glorified beef jerky, the lollipop was horribly according to my gf and the popcorn/breadsticks were not only disgusting, but seemed like they had been left out for several days...just musty, stale and soggy all at once.  The waitress then came by and offered us a hot towel, which she prepared by pouring hot water on a compressed roll of cotton with a teapot, which then expended into a soggy, lukewarm paper towel.Our waitress then came to the table with a wooden box, opened it and offered us two ""cheese cigars"" (a direct quote)...the cheese cigars were, predictably, your standard microwavable fried mozzarella sticks, but I can't even say they tasted as good as something you might buy in a freezer aisle.  That was the end for us - it's not a cheap restaurant, and we weren't going to risk a few hundred dollars on their food.  So, we got up and left, got a take-out margherita pizza from a place up the street, watched a movie in our apartment and made a toast to not wasting our money on bad food.Long story short, this place is a tourist trap built to take the money of people that don't know any better.  It is well-reviewed, which I can only presume means that many people on Yelp don't have the most sophisticated of tastes.  But, if you are looking for type of experience described in those reviews, I'd suggest looking in a different neighborhood.  We wish we had booked something in Plateau or one of the other more interesting, cultured neighborhoods."

On every visit he would step away from the delights of the kitchen to say a very quick hello.

I say this NOT as a slight but as a true explanation of what you (will) experience. SENSORY OVERLOAD! The BEST way to explain this is to reference the Disney Pixar movie, Ratatouille! trying to explain the overall experience is like Ratatouille trying to explain to his brother food tastes! Even more difficult is the actual tastes that explode on your palate that render ones mind inoperable for a few moments at every bite! The experience will leave you utterly whirling at your seat.Anyone who has read any of my reviews will know that I do not GIVE away rave reviews!

But Europea is now playing a defending game where nothing changes, and what I had seen as genius and new, now appears as gimmicks and old cheap tricks. If you have been once, you will not need to come back. Great quality, you should go - but it is very disappointing that nothing ever changes. It is time for Jerome Ferrer to rethink his menu and get inspired by more contemporary ideas. His menu and gimmicks now feel a little bit dated. If you are from Montreal and you think this is the pinnacle of food, you need to get out of the city and travel to New York or Tokyo - or at least Google what today's top chefs are doing. Europea is the kind of restaurant that desperately would hope to get one Michelin star, but would lose all of its personality trying to get there by focusing on dated and gimmicky presentation instead of inspired flavors."

I found that many of the appetizers clashed, as did the mini desserts.  Highlight was the fois gras caramelized on a hot stone set in a dinner plate under a glass bell jar... Very tasty and cooked literally right under your nose! Also the lobster bisque was perfect, the best I've ever had. So I had huge expectations of their of their signature entrée - veal cheek in a chorus sauce. But I found the meat too tender, almost mushy,  and the flavoring too salty.  Overall,  I was impressed by the presentation... but some of the dishes still have room for improvement."

My husband and I came here for dinner just a week before I gave birth to our daughter and I sometimes wonder if she came almost 2 weeks early so that she could escape my womb to eat at this amazing restaurant again. *giggle*  We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing (I know, I know, so pregnant and drinking alcohol is such a no-no, but I promise you that I had just a sip and hubby was hyper-happy to finish all my glasses for me). On the night we dined here, all of the staff here, from waitress to pastry chef to the chef de confiserie (yes, a restaurant that makes its own candy, try to top that!) to the head chef were all born, raised and trained in France. Even the surrounding tables had French patrons, we were starting to wonder if we were the only non-French in the restaurant. That aside, we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this restaurant! It is like Disney World for your taste buds. If you are looking for a bit of a splurge (anyway, it is still much cheaper than flying to Paris to eat at a comparable restaurant. Am I right?!) and you seek a memorable and amazing dining experience, then this is a must!

I loved the first course, the lobster cappucino was just fantastic, and then it kind of just went downhill from there... I chose the lower river shrimps and pea veloute for my second course. Really, it should only be ordered in the summer. The veloute is cold and the shrimps are tiny. My friend`s beef tartar was ok, but since I am not a fan of beef tartar, I couldn`t take more than a bite of it. For the main course, I had the cornish hen. It was cooked to perfection. The pea mousseline that came with it tasted exactly like what was on the plate of the second course, and since I didn`t enjoy it the first time, I wasn`t too excited to find it on my plate a second time around. My friend`s bass filet was nicely done, although the portion was tiny and I felt really guilty for eating even a bite of it. The desserts were not really memorable, but the final touch with the cotton candy brought on a bit of childhood nostalgia. There was more cotton candy  than we could eat, but it was a fun final touch. The $8 sencha at the end felt like highway robbery. If I had chosen this menu for supper, I would say that it is a decent prix fixe menu, but for lunch, it is a little too extravagant."

I cannot imagine ordering the 10 course pre fixe menu as the law of diminishing returns would kick in after the 5th course.  Although the service is decent,  it was spotty at times due to inconsistent lag time between each meal.  Overall, it was not the best we ever had but it was very good."

/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Except 200-220$ (tip included) for the Previous Commentary by Christopher M.,  but I must add some notes. First of all the French Toast with Foie Gras and berry with reduces Chicoutai was Extraordinary. I think I'd have that everyday. The Princess scallops with porcini cream was really good: The texture - almost crispy-ish of the scalopp with the creamy taste was a nice blend in mouth .It is some New French Cuisine with some extreme talent. As for the Service, I'm French I know it was relaxed and absolutely professional and since there as no english-speaker client around our table, I must say that I don't know if they might be a language barriage of not.  The Service was fast and you could feel the kitchen staff was drilled and professionnal; The talent was constant. I took the Menu Degustation Signature"" with the accompanying wine pairing (5 glasses of wine) (too)).  Wine were approx. some 20-50$ wine so somehow some decent quality wine. As for the CO2 ceasar salad, it is presented as an experience therefore I could not agree on the taste. Personally I thought i was special but not in the bad way. Good mixed taste with the Parmeggiano but I would have found the taste a little bit more fun if the porcetta was cut in small bites and pour into the «Salad Mousse». All the portion were really by the book of French Cuisine standard full 7 courses meal ; approx from 40 to 100g per course (2 to 4 onces) and the main course was 150g (4.5-5 onces). The Cheese course was really well presented and all cheesed were tempered so the flavours were enhanced and tastier. As an ex-cheese-seller I can definately assure you the selection is good. The presentation and the freshness and taste of desert were incredible. Again, another point where I would disagree with the previous post is the price which is justifiable because you have some extremly high quality products that are fresh and  as an Ex-Chef I can tell that the cost of the products that are served in your dishes easiely cost 30$- 40$. So basically if you go there and have some training in the food business, trust me, you'll be AMAZED by the technics they're employing for the menu. I think the same Restaurant in New York City would cost approximatively 300-400$ per person. Such products are really hard to find and not foundable in a near area."

The service was not very good at all.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but the attitude was just not right.  If I'm paying $300 for dinner, I don't need a waitress who's snobby.  I was ordering 18 year Yamazaki and every time she brought one out, it was smaller than the last.  I mean, 2 sips maybe.  I've never gone anywhere where they serve such embarrassing drink portions.  Man, raise the price and serve a decent amount.  I didn't want to complain so finally I just said, ""do me a favor, please take this back and tell the bartender to serve me a double because I'm not used to seeing a glass served with such little alcohol."" This girl tells me, no, drink that and then I'll get you anotherone.  Are you kidding me?  This was just one of the things.  She had an attitude and frankly, I go pay big money to dine at these kinds of restaurants because I want to be treated like a king while I dine like a king.  As for the food, each dish was ok.  I did not think they were imaginative at all.  Like I said, absolutely nothing memorable.  Nothing I haven't had before.  When comparing it to the other restaurants we dined at in Montreal, I would say that this was easily the worst one.  The ambience was nice and the presentation was very good, but it just came up short in the service and food, which is why I go to a place like this in the first place."

/user_details?userid=ROEdUOfWkjjF_qxAmEQziQ,Yumi L.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"I was really looking forward to this meal with all the awesome reviews.  I visited this restaurant for the last supper of a 3 day weekend trip to Montreal. I was very disappointed. First, the restaurant has a weird design.  The kitchen is in the basement, seating is available on the 1st and 2nd floor, and the bar is on the 2nd floor. I feel bad for the waiters there.  They had to walk up and down carrying the food and drinks.We had 2 discovery tasting menus with different selections so we can try everything.  They started us off with a lobster bisque, which was good but would of enjoyed more lobster bits in the ""shot"" of soup. Appetizers, we had the tomatoes with mozarella and crab salad.  The tomatoes were very sweet and served on top of a syrup glazed wafer-like thing, which made it even sweeter! I think I would of enjoyed it more with a savory cracker base instead.  The crab salad had non-existent crab.  Although the presentation was fancy, I was not impressed.  Thank god we ordered an extra appetizer, Bison tartare, which was the only fantastic dish. Entree, we had the mushroom ravioli which was very heavy and served on a big bowl, which made it hard to cut up and eat.  (They were huge pieces of ravioli, not bite-sized.)  Also, had the veal served with some potato puree, not impressed.  They finished the meal off with a bunch of sweets/cookies, icecream lollipop thing, a huge fluff of cotton candy, and more cookies to take home.  Sugar overload!I think they try really hard to make it creative and fun dining experience.  But for me, I care more about the food over the presentation.  The service was okay, they forgot our tea and coffee (had to remind them) and they did not offer ground pepper for our raviolis.  This was the most expensive meal we had during our trip and it was the most disappointing.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants to go to which will definitely give you a better ""food"" experience. (Toque! was excellent and so was Au Pied de Cochon)"

All of the food was excellently presented visually and verbally (in English). The wine was perfectly paired. There were numerous snacks before our dinner even started which was nice, and all of the 10 or 12 coures (i forgot how many there were) were very small so you really could eat them all and not feel overfull. My only complaint and it is a big one is that the food was not excellent. Everyone around us got the same course menu and it just seemed that it was pushing food out and neglecting the taste option. This is not to say that the food was bad, it was not. It just was ok. Also, our bill was over $400, which we expected from previous posters."

/user_details?userid=xzyJzjk5J5vweSJv27Jx5Q,jenilee p.,"Salem, MA",5 star rating,"i think everyone can recall specific detail of many momentary tastes they had experienced in their first truly exquisite meal. it may not be their favorite meal, or their choice of hypothetical last meal (as this often returns to something your mother made), but it is etched in each person's memory as the moment where they spent more than they ever had before, and walked away with a memory an experience, and a justification as to the value of fine flavor in a world of economic woes. europea is that first fine meal for me. i and my then boyfriend, and now husband, had spontaneously driven the hours and hours up to canada one year for an international film festival, and as we had been experimenting with several cooking techniques, we decided to splurge, and really try to find out what food cooked by someone with classical french cooking skill tastes like. the person at the hotel desk recommended europea, which was located only a few blocks away.we decided on the tasting menu, with wine pairings, which was a tremendous amount of money in that we had both just started ""grown up"" jobs. but it was completely worth it, and again and again, this restaurant remains my benchmark in an experience of a meal that was completely worth the amount of money we had paid.i can't recall the exact order or items of the menu. but i will tell you that i still recall the taste of the amuse bouche as if it were ten minutes ago. a tiny spoon, and a little espresso cup, filled with the finest, richest taste of lobster cappuchino, or bisque, that you could ever imagine. it sent both of us into a closed eye making of a memory. other dishes that followed included my first taste of foie gras, which was seared and served with a fruit based sauce. of course, the meal continued on with wines, meats, cheeses, and delightful deserts, ending with the finest cup of coffee i've ever closed a meal with. we both left, slightly tipsy, and with the feeling that we would value food as an art for the rest of our lives. each dish cooked once, for one patron, and is different each subsequent time it is cooked due to variations in cooking time or seasons. i felt truly lucky after this meal. i wish i could recite to you the sequence of dishes, but honestly i wasn't of the initiated at the time that i had eaten here. what i would recommend is that if you're in montreal and in need for a real treat, but have never had an extensive tasting menu before, take the plunge and try this restaurant which will set your standards for you. i truly enjoyed it, and have gone on to taste the creations of the likes of pierre garnaire (paris), david chang (new york), the chefs at les ambassadeurs (paris), my boy ken oringer (boston), etc etc. europea still remains amongst the best and of course my virgin tasting menu. and as a result, fine food is now draining my expenses day after day, but without regret:)"

There was one I couldn't take another bite of because it made me (us) want to throw up. Graphic, I know... but I don't think it was the restaurant's fault. The dish had a particular cheese in it that was just so overbearing and it offended my mouth!! and I love cheese! So that was weird. The service was overattentive which is always a good thing when you are wanting a romantic evening with your squeeze for a holiday. For the money and the inconsistency of the food, I don't think I will be going back again if I'm in Montreal.... Piet de Cochon will always win my vote...but it is a beautiful restaurant.

/user_details?userid=vtP1Sne6TwBhhHSLZojPcA,Jeff C.,"Laurel, MD",3 star rating,"So I was trying to find a restaurant comparable to Toque.  Someone suggested Europea to me.  I went there by myself.  Got an outside seat.  First, the weather was good, so it was okay.  However the club across the street was blasting dance music all night, which degraded the dining experience.  Then the dishes took at least 20 minutes each, add that to the tasting menu, and we get a 4 1/2 hour dinner.  Yes, they said it was their busiest night, but that's no excuse.   At the end, the cold night air was too much for me, and I had to call it quits early.  Even with like 10 patrons left there, the dishes were taking half an hour each.  The food was so-so. Maybe better than your average restaurant, but nothing to wow about.  Even the full Foie Gras dish I ordered extra wasn't well balanced, with too heavy of the liver taste.  Yes, there was some hype with the thick egg soup, bringing you a whole crock pot showing you a chicken, but you got to taste about a mouthful.  The cotton candy bit (which came too late for me).  The quality of food was there, just not as good as I expected.  The place is tiny, and I am not sure doing up, downstairs and outside is the way to go.  Overall, I regret going to Europea instead of Toque.  Will not do that again."

(my mom said it was her favorite out of everything we had that night.) a few minutes later, our veal came. it was tender, moist, and flavorful.but wait! there's more! after we finished our main dish, our server asked us if we wanted any dessert, but we were both so full so we declined. a few minutes later, a complimentary dessert plate arrived. it had french macaron, strawberry marshmallow, and a bite of pistachio cake. plus, there was also a bowl of cotton candy! even though we were already full, we managed to finish our desserts, all of which were as yummy as they looked.europea, thank you for a DIVINE DINING EXPERIENCE! next time i'm in montreal, i'm definitely going back!

The food itself was really great..especially the foie...seared and finished with veal ju and a pinch of coffee, it was a really rich dish...very bold for the chef to serve it like that as opposed to the usually way of serving seared foie with some sort of fruit garnish to offset the richness of the foie. The teaser of a lobster ""cappucino"" with black truffle left me speechless. My entree of veal cheeks was really good, but maybe a tad less exciting than what came before.

It was actually on the same street, same block as our hotel, which turned out to be a very good thing since we were so drunk and stuffed after our meal that all we could manage to do was stagger down the street back to our hotel. We had the nine course tasting menu, with wine pairings, and it was stunning. Everything - service, food, presentation - was seamless. Obviously this is going way back, but I think the entire meal set us back approximately $400 USD and it was the best $400 I ever spent! It epitomizes why it is worthwhile to pay for experiences rather than stuff.
