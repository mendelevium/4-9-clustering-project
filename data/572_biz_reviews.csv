I came back today with a group of friends and it was a fucking mess. We ordered in couples, separately. I ordered first and got my food last. Despite having ordered the least amount of food in the group. We repeated our order 4 times to the guy at the cash. A Philly trio, a Crispy chicken trio, and a Philadelphia. They were busy, understandable that there was a wait. We waited over an hour before anyone in our group got food. They called me to pay first. $43. We go outside to eat, and it's the complete wrong order. It was someone else in our groups order. I went back inside to get refunded and charged my correct order. I paid on my car and was refunded cash. He apologized and that would've been great if my order came soon there after. The rest of the group got there's with multiple mistakes on their orders and missing items. 40 minutes on top of the hour we waited we finally got our food. Which yet again was wrong and missing items. We received 2 sandwiches. 1 still being wrong. But we still ate it as we were starving. We were missing the crispy chicken and both fries. When we went to tell them, we waited another 30 minutes for the final sandwich. Which AGAIN was FUCKING WRONG. Despite it being wrong I had zero patience to go back and wait some more. When I bit into my sandwich the chicken was rock solid and had no meat. Disgusting. I spent $30 over 2 hours for nothing but shit service and shitter food. And the staff were not wearing masks properly. I.e., around their necks NOT covering their nose or mouth. In the midst of a pandemic which has MTL in a red zone. Will never be back or recommend to anyone."
