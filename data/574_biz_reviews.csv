/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've been looking forward to trying Toledo's baguette because the bakery won best MTL baguette maker 2020. The bakery is currently open for takeout during the covid-19 crisis. We picked up a baguette and almond chocolatine. The baguette is excellent!! The pastry was also delicious and generously filled with almond and chocolate.
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Pretty good coffee and pastries. I tried the almond chocolatine and small latte. The chocolatine was fresh and the almond taste was strong. It was a bit too oily and hard on the edges. The latte was milky and pretty good. The service is quick and the staff are nice. They don't have many tables inside.
/user_details?userid=VClRFo4FaJKhGIyTQcoHVg,Urvi T.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,Delicious treats and pastries for a nice breakfast with the family! My favorite is the raisin roll (which was by far soooooo good that I'm still thinking about it)! And the sesame buns are so subtle in flavor that it's a great accompanying dish. Croissants are a bit buttery but still good! Everyone is really sweet here and the ambiance is a cute cafe vibe. Check it out for a nice sweet start to the day.
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Named after a Toledo scale left by a previous owner, this bakery slash coffee shop slash lunch spot opens up to a beautiful space with 14 foot ceilings and tons room for people to browse, enjoy a coffee, stop for a quick bite or even lounge on the long benches, antique chairs and poufs.There's a nice selection of breads, some light pastries, muffins, croissants and for lunch, a variety of sandwiches, vegetarian bowls, vegan bowls, salads and soups... all good bread buddies!Oh oh, and they also serve your favorite cup or coffee from Structure Roasters, new in Old Montreal.What interesting about Toledo, is the founder, Francois Barri√®re, came from the banking market and jumped into bakery - his first venture into the food scene, pursuing his true passion and love for bread. This said his business background does come in handy and he is backed by a solid partner: Riccardo Arnoult, former lead at Amour du Pain, adds years of experience, and lead a team of bakers and pasty chefs who's mission is to delight us with their creations.Picked up a croissant, a baguette and a small loaf of dark chocolate bread, interestingly very good with cheese. Will probably come back to try the coffee and see how this place unfolds in the coming weeks."

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,One thing I must say about this place is that it has excellent service. Their variety of sandwiches is good and their coffee is strong. Good muffins and quiche and this is a great place to meet up with friends or come to work on your computer.
/user_details?userid=ryQsc-8qVknTl3j0TWGukA,Rc L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm here several times a week. Really great atmosphere and friendly service. Fresh, quality items. Wish they had more than one soup option though!"
/user_details?userid=reipvRp7rg-O2HoKwopcxA,Jennifer P.,"Brighton, Canada",2 star rating,"Coffee is great and the space is airy and ""trendy"" but the food requires more care and the service can be improved. I had to repeat my order three times to the point of annoyance when ordering. The same person asked it again after taking the order but moving back to call the order, and finally when paying (again, and it was a coffee and a sandwich for pete's sake). That is ok, I am not a diva but very inefficient and shows staff is not trained. The same staff shows lack of training and care for food which is more important for me: my ham and butter sandwich was fridge cold and pre-made and it was probably refrigerated in its paper wrap (from the coldness of the wrap and the lack of necessity for serving a sandwich in paper wrap when you order for table) and handed to me as is. The bread was tough and rubbery both on the inside and outside (not crunchy like a baguette crust should be, and not airy like the crumb should be) and was impossible to chew, the butter was non existent. The ham was fine but if you pay 9 dollars for a simple sandwich from a place that claims to be artisanal you expect a bit more care and maybe... maybe made to order sandwiches. Lets see if one can do this: Cut the room temp bread in half, spread room temp butter, put ham, close. You can do this in less than the minute I wasted to repeat my order three times."
/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",5 star rating,"Can't say enough positive things about this great bakery on Mount Royal. The layout is inviting with lots of seating and, most importantly, the baked goods are to die for. They have a wide variety of breads and the croissants and cookies were delicious. They also have really cool beverage choices including a grapefruit lemonade. I have been a few times now and plan to go back."
/user_details?userid=99PrzMl_bMnhXPjQ2qPrTQ,Lauren H.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"This is one of the best bakeries I've ever been to. World-class bread served by nice people who don't laugh at my pitiful French. The croissants are delectable and the bread crusty on the outside with a tender, chewy crumb. I'd be there every day if I lived in the area."
/user_details?userid=Osn6GlLDNsNr8Eg4N0E02Q,Laura O.,"Medford, NJ",5 star rating,Delicious pain au chocolat and pain aux raisins. Wish I could sample it all and bring it home.
/user_details?userid=JkATdaOoBZWjhnmgMN7rAw,Alvin Y.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Yay! Saved us from the rain! Cappuccino's on point. Bread game reminds me of Baked in Brooklyn.
/user_details?userid=marKDocEneX2MqxV-OkhkA,Em C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Fantastic coffee. Mediocre counter service. Cozy atmosphere. Singles, couples, families - very welcoming and great vibes. I'll be going back."
