Their maindishes are skewers and they do offer quite a variety from skewers to crawfishes. The place recently added ramen, and they have 5 main types of ramen with non spicy to spicy options. We ordered the beef ramen along with the beef skewers. The beef ramen we ordered one spicy and one non-spicy, the spicey  option had a great taste of spiciness. The skewers had a spice on it making it too spicy for the kids. Unfortunately there was no option of no spice for the skewers. Overall, the taste was good but too salty.The overall encironment was nice and cozy. There was a few tables, it was quite full during the sunday evening we were there. Just a reminder, if you post a picture on your Instagram and tag them you will get the second bowl of ramen half price."

Granted, it's not comparable to the OG skewers that one would find on the streets in China or even in NYC, but it's an option I'm glad to have in Montreal.I had the squid, lamb, chicken, beef, beef tendon, garlic mushroom and shrimp skewers, with a small bowl of rice. I must say, the squid, lamb and chicken skewers were my favourite. Not too chewy, just enough bite, and the spices were very authentic. I did not try the other items on the menu. i actually took one of their combos for two. I would come back again when the craving kicks in, no doubt."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious skewers!!! So glad that a skewer shop opened up in Montreal! Heads up: there is an English menu available if you ask. They also have someone who can speak French/English/Chinese. They'll give you an ordering sheet and you jot down all the things you want to order and hand it to them so they can get started. After you've chosen your skewers, they will light a warmer on your table so that when they bring out the already-done skewers, it can be kept warm as you eat. Favorite things there: the squid, chicken, and shrimp Other things we ordered was very delicious too. Only thing was that the pot of spicy skewers that we ordered came with mostly stomach/tendon etc. The menu mentioned that it came with beef, corn, and kelp knots I think. But we didn't get any of that. And instead got beef and innards. Technically, I think what we got was ""worth"" more, but I also don't eat innards so that was a bit of a waste. They also forgot about my oyster initially so we had to remind them well after we were finished most other things. Total bill came to around $50 for two for us!"

It's the same model I tried at my house. And I realized, "" it doesn't work "".That sums it up.Happy new year!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food and good service. We took many kinds of skewers and other stuff. The lamb, pork belly, chicken and fish tofu skewers were amazingly good. They were packed with flavor and grilled perfectly. The beef and the conch shell skewers were way too tough and overcooked so we didn't really like them. We got the medium spicy pot which comes with 10beef, 10 konjac and a few corn skewers. You can also add extra ingredients. It was delicious and wasn't too spicy. The grilled eggplant was so delicious. It was soft and the ground pork was full of garlic flavor. The grilled squid had a tasty sauce but it was a bit too chewy. We also got some abalone and were very disappointed by the size and taste. It was 5$ for a tiny piece and it was very tough to chew on and too salty. The place isn't very big but it's clean and modern. The skewers are all put on some sort of grill that doesn't really grill. The meat were already cooked before arriving to our table. It's mostly just for the looks. It was a bit inconvenient to eat them since we ordered a lot of skewers and they tried to fit everything on the same tiny grill. The service was great. The staff were nice and came to refill our water several times. Overall, it was a good experience and most of the food were delicious. I now know which ones to order and which ones to avoid for next time!"
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"It's a Chinese style bbq place.  There's quiet a lot food choices. Recently they have added chongqing style noodle. My husband and I decided to give a try yesterday. We ordered one small bowl of chongqing style beef noodle and a bunch of bbq food. Including a lamb leg , some grill scallop.  In general , the food taste good.  Don't forget to tell the waiter not to put chilli powder if you can't it spicy food. Because by default the chef make them spicy. I'm giving lower rating because the night after eating at this restaurant, both my husband and I got diarrhea... I swear we didn't have any other food after this meal.  So... there must be something wrong with one or some of the food we ordered."

The lamb is good and others maybe strange to a normal taste. There are also rice plate and noodles to choose from. I had some lamb, pork, squid and a pot of vermicelle. Each item was inexpensive but if you want to be full, it may be pricey. I recently noticed they updated their menu. The service was warm."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was briefly held by The Captain's Boil. The giant squid on the back wall is actually still there, but now it fits right into Barbecue and Bar de Yan's interior. I was really excited to try this place, since skewers are one of my favorite street foods; I can probably eat 20 lamb skewers in one setting (although skewers in China can be kind of tiny)!The menu was nicely illustrated and prices were clear. They give you a little piece of white paper to write your order on. Once an order is placed, they bring you a printed out version of the order, and each item is scratched off once it's served (like at dim sum). It's really helpful to prevent forgotten items, but I think the list is written in Chinese only. We ordered a couple crowd favorites (lamb, chicken, squid, quail egg, shrimp, etc.) as well as scallops and shrimp fried rice. It took a while for the food to arrive, and when it did it came one item at a time. I think it would be nicer if they could get the whole order ready before bringing it out. Flavors were very good, with cumin as main seasoning, but also soy sauce-based flavors for the chicken and squid. The cumin flavor got a bit redundant in the end, but hey --- classics always work. The lamb was quite fatty (which I personally like). The shrimps were the least exciting, as they were a bit dry. The fried rice was very proper and tasty, although a tad too oily. Overall, we had a nice meal, and service was very good. It wasn't street food level cheap, but not as expensive as e.g. Otto Yakitori Izakaya."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Interesting new chinese barbecue spot, with a focus on skewers. It's situated in the swatow plaza in chinatown, replacing the Tomasan ramen that occupied that space previously. They have these little rocks on each table, which they heat up to keep your skewers warm. Their menu consists of mostly different meats and veggies on skewers, along with other main dishes and sides. One interesting thing about their menu is that the chinese version and the english version are quite different. For example, the hotpot that came with beef stomach was replaced with corn in the english menu. Being a someone who reads chinese like a first grader but also wanted authentic chinese food, ordering was a mind bending task. The service was fast and efficient, your orders are taped to the table.Anyways, we went with a hotpot and a variety of skewers. The hotpot came with beef, beef stomach, and tripe. Youcan also add on extra items for a dollar. The hotpot items were just boiled, and boiled sliced beef is rather mediocre. The barbeque skewers were wonderful though! The lamb skewers reminded me of the street food festival stalls back in toronto. Everything was well seasoned and barbecued perfectly. Each skewer is a couple dollars, but you have to keep an eye out on the total as you add items to your order. The bill racks up quickly! I think they could definitely decrease some prices for the portions they give. The quality is worth your money,but don't expect a huge feast if you're on a budget. At the end of your meal, it is quite satisfying to look at the bucket of sticks you polished off."
/user_details?userid=LP_sp5e4S34gjJwGAIFWuA,Mateus T.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Loved my experience there.We tried the cucumber salad entre to begin and my girl loved it.Most of our meal was trying to different brochettes of various meats. Chicken, beef and even octopus, all were so very well seasoned.We also tried the hotpot, it was good.I'm used to spicy food and glad I am because my date was eating the cucumber salad throughout the meal to cool down her mouth.For two people, both full at the end and a tip included, expect to pay around $55. Which I think is more than fair for the quality of food.All in all, I would give it a 5/5 but it's true that it might be a bit spicy for the average person."
/user_details?userid=zt6dt5T2QZRARtWsdIW5MQ,Yi M.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,The lamb and beef skewers are cooked just right. The meat is tender with cumin powder. The grilled eggplant is oily but tasty if you like garlic as I do. Do not eat the skin because it is burned (not good for you).

The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was relaxed and the food was fresh and delicious. Altogether a delightful lunch stop."

I kept thinking I would definitely come back. But the service wasn't the best. The waiter looked very bored the whole time, it was hard to make us understand, the waitress who was there could speak English perfectly but she left as her shift ended so the guy who couldn't really speak English was alone for the service. Not practical. We didn't receive some of the food we ordered but couldn't make ourselves understood. We still paid because we had to leave in a hurry."
