The food was flavorful and hearty, and the serving size was huge - enough to make a voracious eater like me feel full for hours! Definitely recommend this dish if you go to Aux Vivres. Service is friendly and price is reasonable, especially for such a large serving. They also have a small grocery section where they sell many desserts, whole cakes, cookies, sauces, refrigerated/frozen meals, stews, burgers, nuts, tempeh, etc."

I only wish there was a place like this closer to where I live!My sister and I have now been here three times--once back in May and twice while visiting Montreal last weekend. It's our absolute favorite because the food is SO. GOOD. The brunch portions are huge and filling. All of the food is so delicious that you'll forget you're eating vegan. I highly recommend the polenta with beans. For anyone who is skeptical of vegan food, YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE. It will change your mind. Guaranteed.The space is clean and cute. Plenty of seating. Great atmosphere. Typically a young crowd--both as staff and customers. Nice plants around as decor. All of the staff is bilingual in French and English."

/user_details?userid=C1C-0-iUcugXcqctnoGnUw,Garima D.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved mostly everything that I've tried here. It's great that the menu isn't overwhelming yet has just the perfect number of options within various cuisines. I'll go one by one over all the dishes I've tried in my 3-4 visits here.1. Poutine - Absolutely delightful sauce, I am not a big poutine fan & this one wasn't like anything I've had before. If you dig the real cheesy poutine, you should rather skip this dish. The potatoes weren't cut like fries but wedges. This dish was 5/5 for me.2. Mumbai Burger - Another delightful dish, completely influenced by Indian preparation, even has a hint of tamarind sauce on it. I could totally go back for this. Another 5/5.3. Mexicali Burrito Plate - Didn't quite appreciate the burrito but loved guac and everything else on the plate. 3.5/54. Chana Paratha - Typical Indian dish, amazing flavors. Completely loved the flavor of bread, which has a touch of garlic on it, slight improvisation on the typical indian bread 5/5.5. Malai Kofta - I was expecting a little too much of it after trying their chana, due to that I'd give it a 3.5/5. The gravy was great, kofta could get better.6. Berry Uncheesecake - I just couldn't believe that it was an uncheese version of cheese cake. One of the best un""cheese""cake I've ever had. 7/5. A total winner!P.S. They are a little better than the Aux Vivres Westmount ;)"

It's one of the first vegan restaurants in Montreal so we were excited to try it. Unfortunately, we left a little disappointed.The menu is pretty basic: soup, salads, sandwich, burgers, etc. There was nothing new to try - except maybe the faux lox. Overall, we thought it was a little pricey for what it was. We ordered the lox sandwich and salad deluxe. Both were tasteless and didn't have anything special to it. The sandwich was big but came with no side. Also, the ingredients in the salad didn't really go well all mixed together (I.e. guacamole + faux lox), itd be probably better to eat it all separately. Overall, it's a good place when you can't find vegan food near by. But I wouldn't consider it a ""must do"" in Montreal."

My bro in law recommended this place and although eggs are a big part of my breakfast/brunch, I didn't miss it for a second after eating here. It was a busy morning when we arrived and were told it would be a 10 Mins wait (in reality it was more like 20). We got seated soon and our servers came to us right away. I ordered the matcha latte and it was probably the strongest one I have ever had. It was pretty rich and I enjoyed it quite a lot. For food we got the Mumbai bowl and the rancheros. The rancheros came with tofu (although it was tastier than tofu, hence i wonder if was paneer) and was a good enough quantity. I never ended up finishing it but it was my next day's breakfast! Their menu is extensive and has options from all over the world. I have not enjoyed a vegan place as much as I did this one hence without a second thought this deserves a 5 Star!"
/user_details?userid=oCKtbgKBtYb44q1zqqefNA,Rosalie C.,"Milwaukee, WI",4 star rating,"#veganI had three experiences with this place during my recent trip to Montreal. It was a place I walked to in hopes to get a smoothie and cheesecake - seemed to be highly recommended online. At first I walked into the restuarant, but soon learned the take out spot is a few doors down, great idea! It is a bit of a mini store with some grab n go/grocery items and then the take out menu. I got the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake, berry cheesecake and mango lassi. The chocolate PB cheesecake was definitely worth it, I quite enjoyed that delicious treat. The berry cheesecake was ok, I prefer a light say cherry drizzle over my cheesecake while this had a thick dense fruit thickness on top of the cheesecake. I intended to get the creamsicle smoothie as I read about it but when I asked what the most popular smoothie was they said the mango lassi. So glad I got that, so sweet and SO DELICIOUS. Later that evening we actually ordered from here again, as they participate in Uber Eats. I got a salad and a BLT. The salad was alright. The BLT.... not as expected. It was both good and not so good. Mostly it was alot of wrap and alot of lettuce with tomato and then tons of coconut bacon flakes. Just didnt feel like it had the substance I was looking for and could have used some more sauce. We walked back again for another mango lassi though!!! The vegan mango lassi is a must. The cheesecake is worth a try and the food, Id try it again. The people were also very pleasant. The prices are fair enough."

I realise I'm going to sound like a total hippy here, but I was looking for a light vegetarian lunch before my acupuncture appointment (I have anxiety, and it seemed like it might help.)I ordered the starter Chana Paratha and a side of potato wedges with chipotle mayo. The Chana Paratha was thick and incredibly flavourful, with more spice than I was expecting. I was glad to see it wasn't watery or weak, but instead, hearty and delicious, full of chickpeas and peas, and very filling for a $6.50 small meal. The wedges were good, with a light vegan mayo that was a little less thick than egg mayo but still basically the same thing (you can even buy it in shops!). Pretty good portion sizes, too - I'm glad I didn't get a bowl meal because it probably would have been too much for lunch!The service was fast despite my table being hidden behind a 4 foot wall, which was a relief, and despite being full I got a table pretty quickly. I'm excited to come back here! It's not quite as groundbreakingly delicious as Cafe Resonance's much smaller all-vegan menu but it's definitely going in my regular rotation."

Came here for brunch on a Sunday with friends and got the huevos rancheros. The textures and flavors were.. interesting. The tortilla were quite hard and difficult to cut through. The flavors were abit strange and the textures as well. Maybe because it was vegan? But I'm sure you can make vegan ingredients work for this dish. The guacamole was not creamy enough and the little paper cup of ranch or whatever dressing seemed cheap. Overall, very unexciting but it satisfied my brunch craving at least."

Luckily Montreal has no such issue and Aux Vivres Plateau tops the list of spots.With the cozy diner feel and large portions of deliciousness you are not going to regret coming here. I fully endorse getting La Polenta which is essentially huevos rancheros with fried polenta instead of wedges.
/user_details?userid=OG3kBKCMUSXXKMgJlRiHhw,Brittany R.,"West Henrietta, NY",5 star rating,"Visited Aux Vivres during a recent trip to Montreal and this was, hands down, my favorite meal. Ordered The Complete during brunch (until 4pm in the weekends) which comes with tofu scramble, sausage, potatoes, corn bread, a small salad, and a chai (or coffee). Yes, I cleaned my plate and I have no shame because it was like a party in my mouth. The sausage had sweetness to it that went well with the saltiness of the scramble and everything came out hot and fresh. The green dressing they use on the salad has dill in it which gives it a pop of flavor. Menu is in English and French and staff is bilingual. The interior has kind of a diner-ish vibe, but very clean and bright. Highly recommend"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I finally visited Aux Vivres after hearing so much about this place. I left feeling somewhat disappointed.I ordered the latke burger dressed with vegan tzatziki, tomato, pickle and lettuce on a whole wheat burger bun, served with potato wedges. There was a long hair on my plate under the burger so that wasn't a great start. I threw it away as a reflex before I could say anything to the waiter so that's on me. But how did they not catch that? The patty itself was made of sweet potatoes and beets so that was pretty yummy. I also liked their vegan tzatziki but their potatoes were bland and the pieces were way too large.My sister ordered the BLT that comes with coconut chips instead of bacon. The wrap was so huge she had to take half home and it doesn't even come with a side! She would have preferred if the wrap was half the size but with interesting sides like a soup & salad. I hated that they sat us near the window as it was way too hot there from the sun. The people who got to sit away from the windows were better off. The banquette side is pretty uncomfortable so I just wanted to leave the whole time. The service was great though. Fast, friendly, polite. The food legit came out within 5 mins!We shared a large berry smoothie, which was delicious and refreshing. We also tried the banana chocolate pie; it was rich and decadent. Yum. I just wish that instead of a coconut crust, it was a graham cracker one. They should describe it or make it more clear on the menu.So overall, I feel like the menu relies too heavily on soy substitutes (tofu & tempeh) to replace animal products, unlike at Green Panther, Crudessence, Lola Rosa, etc. I'll probably give their new Westmount location a try when it opens since it's so close to me but I think if I'm craving healthy, I'll just go to Mandy's or Green Panther. Great option for vegans though!"

Definitely not my cup of tea. The coconut bacon basically just tasted like sweet coconut with a bit of a reddish color. It was too sweet to be put in a wrap. There wasn't much ambiance in the restaurant. It just felt like eating in a cafeteria. The staff isn't that friendly. Overall, we didn't enjoy it and wouldn't go back."

We ended up purchasing an apple chocolate cake to have later. It was amazing! So moist and addictive!The coffee was a rip off. My friend ordered it and besides that fact that it was not good, it came in a very small mug that wasn't even poured to capacity. It cost $2.50 and refills weren't free!Th atmosphere was not great, but the restaurant was clean and cute. I would go back, for sure, but the to-go store is where it's at!

Montreal's first vegan restaurant and definitely one of the BEST I've ever tried. They have a huge menu where EVERYTHING is vegan and I don't have worries on 'hm, would this have egg/dairy in it?' ..needless to say, it's so blessed. We ate here pretty much daily on our montreal trip and we were so so so happy with it. Service is top notch and they're super friendly AND bilingual. Bless. Food came out very quickly too. The menu is HUUUGE and I wanted to eat everything, to be honest. I was sad that I didn't get to try the blueberry pancakes for brunch. I did try the BLT made with coconut bacon and the portions made my inner fat kid extremely happy.. it was pretty much good enough for two people. I'm used to the vegan restaurants in the greater toronto area charging people $30 for a lettuce leaf so when the food came, you can tell I was a happy child.. I couldn't even finish more than half of the thai bowl. In addition to that, heir food is very high quality & definitely fresh.The star of the show is definitely their desserts - if you're vegan, you definitely feel me on this one: it's SOOOO difficult to find vegan desserts just anywhere. I definitely took advantage. Did I order vegan cheesecake (gateau faux-mage .. so cute) for brunch dessert? You bet the hell I did! It was definitely just like real cheesecake and unbelievably creamy. Um yes, please. Can someone please make this for me back home?!?!?

No.But it leaves Moosewood and Rainbow Collective and Casa de Luz cakes far back in the pack.I admire the technical skill of the baker of working out the exact proportions of these recondite ingredients to make the cake a textural and flavor success.* * *So if you need to eat your healthy vegetables, this is a great place to do it.Zucchini in your main course.Zucchini in your dessert."

I got the tempeh before but it feels very dry and sandy and you can taste the soy bean powder after taste. You can't go wrong with the tofu. Their vinaigrette is to die for. I also shared their chilli and nachos. Loveeeeee the guacamole oh mahh goodness was it amazing. I love coming here it makes me feelSain and healthy. They also serve alcohol but its very limited. They only have 3 cocktails on the menu and I tried the mimosa hmm kind of regret it :/ it was super sourish and bitter with freshly squeezed orange though.

Critiques: Bread for the burger was just okay, in my opinion.  I also ordered a mango lassi, which was decent but average.  The drink tasted differently from what you would get at an Indian restaurant.Overall: If you're vegan, this place is awesome.  Carnivores may still prefer real meat over the vegan burgers, but the dishes were well executed and a nice change of pace from fried food and buttery pastries."

You begin to get uncomfortable, but then you find yourself tearing up. You realize it's been awhile since someone held you like that, and it's warm and it's comforting and you feel so incredibly safe in their arms. Then suddenly you realize it's been you that's been holding the hug for too long, and you gently release them, feeling like you can finally exhale. That's what it's like to eat at Aux Vivres."

That being said, I've seen this place change somewhat radically in terms of atmosphere, food and service, which makes it all the harder to review. At another time I could count on a quality Mekong sandwich large enough to be shared between two broke folks- now I find the lunch and dinner quantities underwhelming and the sauce overbearing. Definitely not the kind of meal to be shared. This is also accompanied by a different atmosphere- it's not the intimate little vegan nook it once was.I wouldn't recommend visiting the joint for anything other than brunch- which is the only legit. vegan brunch I can really vouch for in the city (check out that perfectly cooked polenta!)."

They boast such a vibrant menu chock full of both healthy and indulgent vegan dishes, plus desserts, smoothies and juices, that any vegan/vegetarian/omnivore should be satisfied. What I love the most:-Popeye juiceIt's so gingery and refreshing! Even if you're the type who suffers through their glass of green juice if it's super green, this one is sure to change your mind. -La Polenta (on the brunch menu-- available only on the weekend)My god, this plate is absolutely what the doctor ordered. It's hearty and delicious, with big hunks of tasty polenta over refried beans + zesty tofu scramble(cooked with nutritional yeast), perfect guac and salad (that dilly dressing is dreamy). The perfect plate if you don't actually eat until the mid afternoon when you realize you're fucking starving. -Buddha BowlIt's simply a huge bowl, abundant with veggies, rice and grilled tofu that is out of this world delicious. But what really takes it to the next level is that ramekin of Buddha sauce (think: umami and not sweet!)And this may not seem like a big deal to you, but their soy cappuccinos are perfection. Coming from an espresso fanatic!This is more of a note for me and shouldn't discourage you at all, but I wasn't crazy about the the BLT because I prefer a more savory fake bacon, maybe made of tempeh, rather than the sweet coconut variety, also way too much mayo. The wrap isn't my favorite kind, but that's because I'm weird about wraps and probably shouldn't order them. But! My friend couldn't go on ENOUGH about how spectacular the Dragon wrap is and just know that it holds up to the next day as she took it to go! Final note: The key lime pie is disappointing. To be fair, I took it to go and perhaps it just needs to be eaten immediately, but it appeared rather unappetizing when I first received it and when I went to eat it later, I found it inedible (mainly because the texture is too gelatinous). I'm sure their other desserts are much better! They appear quite enticing, for sure.Besides the great options for all and the fact that Aux Vivre is Montreal's very first vegan restaurant (kudos, mes amis!) I want to note that I just love every waitress I've ever had here. They are the sweetest girls and really take good care of you, even when you're there, ahem, past closing (sorry to be THAT table, but thank you, Aux Vivre, for being open so late because *this* vegan often doesn't sit down to dinner til 10pm!)"

We came right when they were open so maybe the kitchen wasn't ready yet so my sandwich took awhile to come out. I saw the BLT sandwich on Yelp and it looks so good. They saw us struggling reading French so they finally gave us an English menu. They should just always leave out English menu! |BLT sandwich| 11.25 CAD About $8 US money for a sandwich is not bad considering it's vegetarian. So they replaced the bacon with coconut pieces that had a lot of flavor on its own but too dry for a sandwich. We bought a small box of it on the side for our road trip and it tastes better as a snack. What its lacking was the sauce. It was too dry with all 3 ingredients: coconut pieces, lettuce, tomatoes. I'm glad I shared and only had half of it. Could barely make it through."

Nevertheless I wasn't completely convinced by the food. I ordered the Kosmos Plate, at 14.95 CAD the most expensive dish on the menu. Unfortunately the ""souvlaki-style tempeh"" didn't look or taste like souvlaki, the ""pita' was anything but Greek pita, and the potato wedges were just not good and a bit on the raw side. The only thing worthy of its name was the tzatziki. As a half-Greek I can confirm that the taste was pretty close to the original. For dessert I ordered the ""cheesecake"" but that also didn't taste of much. I'm hoping I just made some poor choices and the rest of the menu is better executed. Maybe the breakfast options or the burgers will win me over next time. I'm not giving up on you Aux Vivres!"

There is a nice terrace out the back for the summer months.I did have one ridiculous experience where I ordered the Chana Paratha, described in the menu as: spiced Indian flatbread topped with chana, sour cream, cilantro [now it seems to have changed to mint] & tamarind chutney. When it arrived with 2 cilantro leaves, I asked for a little more and they said they'd have to charge me .75cents. Sure, whatever. A plate arrived with one sprig of cilantro and another 2 leaves. At the same meal, they also charged us for extra dressing. The whole thing struck me as a little classless and a bit ridiculous; and having been a regular, kinda pissed me off.

Sometimes they closely imitate the real thing. Sometimes they don't compare, but are still tasty. And sometimes they're a failure on the scale of Aux Vivre's veggie butter, which I think they must have really worked on to make sure it resembled actual butter in no way whatsoever. If you've ever wondered what corn bread would taste like with Asian salad dressing, Aux Vivres is for you!Aux Vivres makes to-go food that can be found in local groceries and markets. I recently picked up the BBQ Tempeh wrap, because I'd never had BBQ tempeh I didn't love, at least until that day. Would recommend this wrap for anyone who finds tofu just too flavourful. If I had to rate this tempeh's flavour on a scale of 1-5 where 5 is a plain hard-boiled egg and 1 is the tap water at my mom's house, I might give it a 0.75.Aux Vivres makes what my partner calls ""California hippy vegan"" food, the hallmarks of which are a fetishization of certain ""superfoods"", the vege bait-and-switch (it's just like regular butter, in the sense that both are yellow!), and a focus on the foods' health benefits at the expense of rich, full-bodied flavour. Definitely come here if you are looking for an interesting salad to Instagram, not so much if you're after comfort food.The redeeming quality that gave this review the extra star is Aux Vivre's Dragon Bowl, specifically Dragon Sauce, of which you can get a bottle to take home. Whatever Dragon Sauce is, it is delicious, and tastes vastly more like butter than whatever's in their veggie butter."

I usually have a lot of misgivings about veggie restos because sometimes the drinks taste like grass and the food is usually tofu or tempeh done up in such a way to hide the blandness of the meat substitute.I was actually quite surprised, I ordered the mango lassi, a large vegetarian chilli and tried out their choco-banana torte and it was all very tasty. All the tables around me had food like salads, sandwiches, chapati bread and it all looked super fresh and vibrant, people were clearly enjoying their food and lingering over their lunches with their friends.

Now, I don't like either rice or tempeh, of course being a vegan establishment, most of their menu is based on both. Sadface!I wanted to maximize the variety of food and eat something warm, so I ordered the cornbread, a small chilli bowl, a creamsicle smoothie and a side of coconut bacon. The cornbread is not really an appetizer, it's massive, 4 sticks of bread + sauce! Umf. It's surprisingly sweet, with peppers baked in. Not at all what I expected since I come from a garlic cornbread background. The chilli was good, but not remarkable. Now the side of vegan bacon is pretty massive. Delicious, crispy, actually close to bacon in flavour, but sooo salty! I'd actually recommend not ordering it at your table and instead buying it at their store, it's a lot cheaper. The smoothie was the highlight of my meal, and made a fantastic dessert: the taste is exactly that of an orange creamsicle, but with only vegan goodness inside.The space is beautiful, and surprisingly homey, that being said, my waitress was surly and oddly avoidant. Minus points! I left ridiculously full, and a bit miffed. They do seem to have delicious desserts, so I guess that'd be a nice occasion to change my mind.."

I had a Bombay Banana smoothie and miss awesome had a zesty lime-celeri smoothie (forgot name). They were made on spot and were refreshing!- Generous portions: had us rolling after we were done- Food? YUM. We had the large Chili and a Mekong sandwich and we couldn't finish them all. But we saved space for a choco-banana cake! Cons:- Price-wise is alright but not too shabby!- Mekong's peanut butter sauce was a bit on the sweet side, but not that bad!Extras:I am actually omnivore but I really enjoyed it! I will definitely return. Thank you Aux Vivres for being vegan-friendly."

The best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal (and believe me, I've spent a lot of time and money searching).We had the sampler plate of spreads, served with warm chapati. We were blown away by the beauty and creativity of it. Tofu cream? How cute! Olive tapenade - mindblowingly delicious. We promised ourselves we'd eat lightly - but everything disappeared! Who stole the chapati? We couldn't have eaten all that?! Ok, ok, fine. We just had to.My dragon bowl is what I wish every meal could be. Warm, filling, delicious, and exciting. Hello, delicious, incredibly unique and inimitable sauce! Where did you come from? Can I marry you? Why is my friend kissing her BLT? Does she want to marry it too?There's also great music playing and a great, brightly-lit atmosphere. Waiters are all warm and attentive.

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My group of friends decided to try this place out since one of the members is a vegetarian and said that the menu looked amazing. It certainly smelled like it upon walking in, and it was surprisingly less crowded than I expected it to be, so getting a table of four was relatively easy. The menu itself was so large and diverse, so don't worry about not having any solid options because there's something for everyone.Three of us decided to get smoothies to start, and we ordered the Tropicalia, the Blue Monkey, and the Mango Lassi (I'm not exactly sure why it's under smoothies but okay I guess???). Each of them were delectable and definitely required some sort of self-control to not drink them all at once. In addition, I got a malai kofta appetizer, and it tasted wonderfully homey and divine with the combination of chickpeas, various spices, and the sauce that they were cooked in. My friend also got the Tom Yum  soup, which I found to be flavorful, but she said that she felt they OD'd on the ginger a bit.For our main meals, I got the Aux Vivres Burger while my friend got the Mexicali plate and the other two got the Bombay Thali. The burger was really tasty and clearly was made with fresh ingredients, but I felt that it kind of fell apart quite easily so that I was left with a quarter of the patty and one bun by the end. Also, the coleslaw wasn't the best that I've had, but they do serve up some mean roasted potato wedges that I still dream about. All of my friends seemed to like their individual plates, although my friends who had the thali didn't eat the salad on them because they don't consider it ""real food"" hahaha.I skipped dessert this time, but two of my friends ordered the chocolate cake and apple pie. The chocolate cake was served in a really thick slice and was really good, but the apple pie was served in a really flat and thin slice? Both were priced the same as well.Aux Vivres is one of the better vegan dining places I've been to in Montréal, although it can get slightly expensive. While it's by no means a completely cravings-free substitution of meat, it does a decent job of creating spinoffs of classic world dishes that are delicious in their own right."

As we entered, we were surprised at how busy the restaurant was, but we were actually seated and served rather quickly.We ordered:-earl grey tea -blt wrap-Mexican soul food plate (forgot the actual name of it- sorry!) The tea came in a pot and I wasn't given and creamer or milk with it. This was a bit disappointing but the tea on its own had a great depth of flavour, which made up for the lack of soy milk.The BLT wrap was giant in portion size and very filling. It was well enjoyed and was balanced in its flavours and textures.The Mexican soul food plate had chilli, brown rice, salad, and corn tortillas. This dish was gluten free and I highly recommend it. Extremely filling, delicious, well seasoned, and incredible value. The food was served extremely quickly and managed to maintain a beautiful presentation still. The staff knows what they're doing at all times- they were very attentive and made sure every guest was taken care of.Highly recommend for quick vegan meal with gluten free options in the city!

/user_details?userid=ikHTdbcQrKNVvnyetPvTIg,Monica N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't eat here very often because my boyfriend is allergic to soy and nuts (I know, I know -- poor me :( ) BUT when I do come to Aux Vivres I milk it for what it's worth. First, what I like about Aux Vivres is that the staff is always very welcoming and friendly, the establishment is always clean, and they have booths (a.k.a privacy). You always see a mixture of people from stay-at-home moms in Lululemons, hipsters, tourists, yogis, business people that work in the hood, etc. so it's wonderful for people watching while you're waiting for your meal (in the privacy of your booth, obviously...) Recommended dishes (and drinks): Bombay Banane smoothie (I swear that I hear the voice of angels singing when this drink is brought to me), corn bread and the Dragon Bowl with tempeh (mmm..).The brunch is always solid -- le complet is delicious - to reduce the soy intake, I like to have palenta rather than scrambled tofu for an additional 2$ - and the pancakes are tasty and filling (order with appetite).Also! According to my friends who love Aux Vivres as much as I do, the BLT sandwich and the carrot cake come STRONGLY recommended for all you fat vegans/vegetarians/omnivores out there. My only complaint about Aux Vivres is that it's always busy and you may have to wait for seating ;) Enjoy!"

I will say that I have almost perfect this sandwich myself all that's off is the chapatti bread, I can't seem to make it the same way. The coconut bacon, has a smokey, sweet and salty flavour, as well as a slightly greasy aspect to it because of the fat in coconut. The secret to that sandwich is the vegan butter sauce that they spread on the chapatti before applying the vegan mayo, Bacon, lettuce and tomato.  I've also tried there new breakfast burrito, it's great, a generous portion plus a coffee or tea for 5$. Other items I've had include, the portobello burger, the channa wrap, veggie lox, the veggie pate, chilli, faux cheese cake, choco banana pie, many smoothies and fresh juices.  I've been here 20+ times in the past 3-4 years, I've never had a bad meal, the only thing I hate about going to aux vivres is when my meal comes to an end, I just never want to leave.

I think they have a terrace somewhere but.... I didn't see it so maybe that's just a rumor ;-)I started with the Tonic (ginger, lemon, apple) - my immediate reaction was to purse my lips and widen my eyeballs because DAMN it was tart! But it was refreshingly delicious once I got over my sensory shock!As a meal, I opted for Le Complet (tofu scramble, Tempeh bacon, cornbread,fresh fruit, salad and sweet potatoes). The tofu scramble was good - I liked the texture and flavor. The cornbread was delicious, as were the sweet potatoes. The salad came with this amazing Dill vinaigrette that was so good, I bought a bottle before leaving. The Tempeh bacon did nothing for me. I can't say I enjoyed the taste or texture at all.  Overall, the portion size was quite good (for me, anyway) and the price was appropriate ($11 for the plate).  I plan to go back and try one of their infamous bowls - I've heard they're amazing!They have a small shop out front where you can be pre-made meals, or other items like their vinaigrette, baked goods etc."

Arriving on a fresh chapati, the layers of juicy tomatoes, verdant lettuce, vegan mayonnaise, and coconut bacon, had me transfixed on what I could only imagine to be the best tasting vegan sandwich ever.  My friends seemed to know, yet didn't offer even a single bite.  Well played."

The portions sizes are decent and the prices are pretty cheap. When the food is good, it's really good, when it's bad, it's downright awful. Good : The Sirocco wrap, if you get in the take out section is only $5.49. The Dragon sauce is probably the best to compliment that wrap. The 'cheese' scone and 'un-cheese' cakes are probably my personal favorites and I would go out of my way to get those. The Mezze Mediterranean w/ Chapati will not disappoint either!  Bad : Avoid brunch if possible, the blueberry crepes are really dry. The chili fries were a bit cold...and dry. Not impressed with their portobello burger either. There's not much flavour in the tofu, I think it's grilled without seasoning. Bottom Line : I have my favorites, but this is not the place to be adventurous because most stuff are pretty bland without the sauces or just really dry. However, it's still my go to place for cheap vegan foods."

The first time I went I was less than impressed. My bill was $40 and it included an appetizer, main, dessert and drink; I disliked everything! I ordered the kosmos plate which came with a salad that had literally no dressing - that, and the blandness of it all, is what everyone assumes to be vegan cuisine.I couldn't get over all the positive reviews so went again, and ordered different things - can't get enough of it - Sandwiches are awesome... the gyro pita is amazing. Have never had such great tzatziki! - Best chilli - so flavourful. Love the vegan sour cream and guacamole on top- LOVE their brunches. Wow. So filling and so much for the $ - be warned there are line ups on the weekend for brunch - Take out counter is awesome. You can buy their cakes at reasonable prices (carrot cake - amazing) - Service is prompt and friendly Of course there's areas for improvement: renovations are really due - booths, chairs, etc very very out of date. If you went and didn't like it, try it again, try something different - awesome"

The Dragon Salad was delicious! $12. Brown rice was tasty and a good soy and sesame vinaigrette but I was left a little hungry ( just a bit more vegetables) and the grilled tofu could of been marinated for flavour or seasoned and cooked more than the mere scorch line it bore.Overall a great spot for a Sunday light supper that seems to attract all ilk."

This is a great restaurant to convert people to the way of the bean, soy bean that is. I've eaten take out, where I mostly order the Dragon bowl. It is filling and delicious, it's a must have along with grilled tempeh. On one of my more recent trips I order a the living salad (I think) with tempeh and it was great and surprisingly filling. To start that day we had the corn bread with guacamole, very good. I've had it with both the guacamole and veggie butter, my favorite is with the guacamole, however I think everyone must try the veggie butter. I also shared the Uncheescake Cheesecake which was very good, I am still wondering what they put in it to make it soooooo good. If you are a vegan or enjoy eating healthy you must stop by here. If you want to bring some friends to try their first taste of a vegan restaurant, this is a great choice."

The patty and bread were dry and thin, the bare garnish (one thin slice of tomato and lettuce) had been over-refrigerated (?), and the potato wedges were uninteresting and had a granule texture.

If you don't like sweet main dishes (and I don't) avoid the dishes with the Thai peanut sauce. I found them to be horrendously sweet. However, the dragon bowl is on a higher plane of existence. I hate beets but loved them in here. The tempeh burger is so good that I actually enjoyed the Taste and texture of it. I really don't like tempeh. The chili is warming and comforting. Avoid the chili fries. The potatoes are cut too large for it to work well. However the chili and corn nachos is worth it. The blt with coconut bacon is refreshing and not as weird as it sounds. I've never et bacon before, so I have no frame of reference but as a sandwich the dish is a solid win. Cheesecake is dense and rich. Carrot cake is loaded with big flavour. The mango lassi is creamy and tart but not too much like a yoghurt drink as I recall lassi to be. Still tasty in its own right. The creamsicle smoothie is exactly what it says it is. Waitstaff are extremely friendly, and attractive. Decor is a little like a diner but still nice looking. Prices are reasonable for the mountains of food you're getting. Sandwiches are served on chapati and not bread so they are easier to pick up and eat. Not at all messy. Great place to bring a date. Just get one appetiser, one main, and one dessert to share and you'll both be pleasantly full. This restaurant has  its act together."

/user_details?userid=bQcPcvGP7cLpCwzUoa-JwQ,Luke J.,"Saint Louis, MO",2 star rating,"My wife and I recently traveled to Montreal and since she has gluten and dairy allergies this place looked like the it would be great for a visit. We stopped in sometime between 1-2pm on a Monday and it was still kinda busy. This place has a lot going for it. It's got a pretty decent size, lots of choices on the menu, friendly wait staff. Normally I would be giving this place a much higher review.The reason for the low review is this: After sitting without any water or any word from a waiter or waitress for I thought too long a time, one arrived and I ordered the Chili Frites (without sour cream) I believe it was called. The menu said it was ""roasted potatoes with house chili and sour cream"". I was expecting a type of chili topped poutine, or a type of chili cheese fries. What I got instead was a big bowl of chili with carrot shredded to look like cheddar cheese and guacamole. Absolutely no sign of potato. It came in a generous portion but, without any warning from the waitress, it was served so incredibly hot that when I took my first bite I immediately burned the end of my tongue. Not hot as in spicy but hot as in temperature. I actually spit it out before it could burn my whole mouth. This was the first day of a week long visit and the last thing I wanted was for everything I would be eating to taste like rubber. In an attempt to cool it down I began to stir it and blow on it trying to cool it down. In doing so I stirred the little strings of carrot into it which began to cook it was so hot and when it finally cooled enough to eat, the carrot had a very off putting texture being 3/4 of the way cooked, not quite the softness of cooked carrots and not the crispness of raw carrot but somewhere in between and unappetizing. I ended up taking maybe three bites before I gave up.The good news is the waitress boxed it up for me and I ate it for dinner that night. Truth be told it was one of the better things I ate while in Canada, unlike other things I ate on my trip, it was nicely seasoned. However, between the long wait, burn on my tongue, lack of potatoes, and unpleasant texture I can only give my experience 2 stars."

A big win in my books. I hope they'll start stocking their sour cream in the store soon so I can bring some home and have it with pierogies.Serving sizes were pretty large so if you have an appy or a juice, you might have to take home half your roti sandwich for lunch the next day. The food came very quickly and our server was very pleasant.Next visit: dragon bowl or buddha bowl, creamsicle smoothie, maybe the potato/chickpea curry roti or ""lox"" sandwich... Oh, man.

We have a bad habit of ordering food when we're tired instead of cooking (really, ask our banker, he's not very happy with us right now) but we are still trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We were very happy to find Aux Vivres and it has become our undisputed food provider for lazy days, and for others too. We are both vegan and it can sometimes be tricky to find good, fresh and healthy food for a reasonable price. Now I won't say Aux Vivres is cheap, but the food is worth the price, and we have not been disappointed once. Not once! And we've tried a lot of different things, from their burgers to their sandwiches, their specialties to their desserts, and even their brunch! (You can tell we have a lot of ""lazy days"", I'm not even ashamed)I have to say, one of the best thing about Aux Vivres is that even if it is considered a ""trendy"" place, your grandmother would still approve of the portions (you know, the one who keeps saying that you need to ""put some meat on those bones"")! I had a hard time finishing the sandwich in one sitting, and you can be sure that every single item on the menu will probably fill you up! (One thing to remember when you want to order dessert, take something on the lighter side before! And no, not the sandwich!)We would recommend the Chili Fries, the Vege Burger and their brownies, especially for non-vegans eating there! Otherwise, everything else is absolutely delicious and it mostly depends on your personal tastes!"

The veggie 'meats' are tasty and cooked just right but the soy milk they give you for the less than impressive coffee just ain't right, it curdles, YUCK!I would have given this place 4 stars, but on my last visit, I was meeting a friend for brunch. She has a Mira dog named Joey that has to be with her at all times as he is in training. He is well mannered, sits under the table and sleeps the entire time. As he was snoozing away and other patrons were smiling at him, the manager walked over and explained that she knows what a Mira dog is and informed us that she called Mira and was told that she does not have to accept the dog into her restaurant.  No one complained about him and we were thrown out...but not before they made me pay the 5,50$ for the smoothie that I was sipping on while waiting for my friend to arrive. I was stunned that they would make me pay given that we were being tossed out into the cold because of the Mira dog and so I handed over 6$ to which she said ""sorry, I don't have any change unless I go and open the till.""Joey has been to restaurants all over Montreal: fancy and casual and has never been unwelcome before.

Smoothies and juices, comfort food, salads, sandwiches, bowls, burgers, cornbread, chilli, and deserts. They also have brunch on the weekends which I have yet to try but it looks really tasty! The Mexicali Plate is very satisfying for a chilly day and completely filling! It is house chili, brown rice, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas, and a side salad. It is one of my favorite things on the menu! The chili is so delicious you won't miss the meat! Another favourite is the Dragon bowl or the Dragon sandwich. The sandwich is very big and served in chipati which is so tasty! It is stuffed with goodness: tofu, beets, carrots, red cabbage, daikon, lettuce, sprouts, and their special 'dragon sauce'. The bowl is essentially the same thing as the sandwich, but in a bowl served on brown rice. They also offer tempeh for an additional cost. My absolute favourite desert there leaves me so happy that I get it every time and I haven't ordered any other deserts because I don't know if they will be as good as this: the chipotle brownie. It is huge! I think it is $4.25 but totally worth it. It is a chocolate delight! I can't wait to try more of their menu! They also offer take out but you order it in the store entrance rather than the restaurant.

I had a chocolate shake, really thick and rich but not too much. We bought two corn breads and an apple crumble to take home! Yummy when toasted and reheated later.

Hmm... there are going to be 5-7 of us eating, so maybe we'll get six sandwiches? After all, they're only about $10 each.We picked up our order and started unpacking the sandwiches. I thought I was cutting them in half, but really I was slicing each half into a quarter. These are like giant burrito sandwiches (I would call them wraps), and one is easily enough for two (hungry) people. As you may have guessed, six sandwiches was about twice as much as we actually needed. But it worked out, because we wrapped up the remainders and saved it for dinner to-go the next day. Every item was tasty, but stop everything and get the BLT. Flaky and tender smoked coconut (""bacon""), lettuce, tomato, and vegan mayonnaise. We have smoked coconut at a place here in Rochester, but this is easily superior. It has the meaty texture of coconut, the smokiness of bacon, but still a strong sweet coconut flavor.

The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit too strong, but the seitan, cut in thick 'meaty' chunks, was flavoured nicely. The soy chai latte was tasty but could have been a bit bigger.

While a bit of a challenge to find the first time I trekked up that way, it remains probably my favourite Montreal vegan restaurant.On my most recent visit in town for Pycon, I managed to get here twice. Looking forward to my favourites, the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich (where else can you get a good vegan version?), and the delicious brunch waffles.ALAS! Neither remain on the menu. Instead, on visit one, I had their gyro, splitting an order of chili fries with my dining pals. The gyro was great, made cool and tasty by the tzaziki. The chili fries were a little so-so - about 10 wedges, on a bed of chili, topped with sour cream.The second visit was a bit disappointing. I branched out into trying the Dragon Wrap, with a side of sauerkraut. The calling card of this dish, I assume, is the ""Dragon Sauce"", which is best described as ""orange"". It was maybe a bit like French salad dressing. I don't know. All in all not too impressive a sandwich, and I had some serious FOMO towards the BLT that a dining pal was eating, and the gyro that my ghost data from the day before was eating.Topped it off with a coco-cashew cream pie, which was actually pretty excellent, and turned it into a pretty positive experience overall.Still, do I yearn for you, O Montreal Smoked Vegan Meat Sandwich. Maybe I'll try making one at home. I really had my heart set on it."

Super nice server, which surprised me as I expected passive aggressive judgmental vegans, to a degree. Ordered lentil soup, veggie pate. Both were just awesome. I had a burger, and gf had the BLT. BLT is huge, but as close and amazing to a real BLT I had ever tasted. Really good. And my burger was really good too. Though it left me with that full vegan burger feeling for a while after. We also had two Kombuchas.Everything tasted really unique and GOOD. I'm not vegan, but if I could figure out how to cook like that, then shit I'd probably give up meat in no time. Really great stuff.

Great choice. Girl got the Buddha bowl and enjoyed it. We came back again for sandwiches and shared half-each of the Dragon and Mekong sandwiches. Lovely food.

I usually have the Dragon Bowl with grilled tempeh or the Sirocco sandwich. Both I think are great options for someone not necessarily used to eating this kind of cuisine. Tasty, fresh and healthy, what more does a body need? Maybe a smoothie to wash it down. I personally love mangoes so I recommend the Lassi À La Mangue.It also makes a great meal when you're working late as its not heavy at all and leaves you energized. Maybe all employers should start feeding us Aux Vivres?Bon appetit!"

I couldn't tell that the latte didn't have real milk in it.The restaurant in general looks more like a giant diner than a normal place, and service is kind of slow.

I first tried it back in the day when Aux Vivres was still a dank closet with staff with dreadlocks down to their waist and a strong scent of patchouli in the air. They used to have a standard brunch for $11.Then, the tides mysteriously changed and it renovated to the current look and menu. I think a lot of hipster Montrealers took this as a betrayal to the restos' hippie roots and always refuse to go here. I used to adopt the same stance until I tried the deluxe salad, creamsicle smoothie and coconut laced BLT (which tastes far less burnt than it used to).It gets pricey but its good if you want something light. And as a former vegetarian, it's a just try for a menu that you don't have to worry about.Slow service and can get packed in the evening. Decent patio."

Let me start of by saying that I have never bought any of the items from Aux Vivres but I have gladly munched on many items that my girlfriend has gotten from there. As a non vegan, I would not have paid the money for these items. But as of 11:35pm on a Tuesday night, I have officially changed my mind. Everything that I have eaten from this establishment has been superb! With the exception of the faux egg and bacon brunch plate. That one was a bit of a let down, rather bland if I may say so myself. But everything else has been so on point that I am thinking that perhaps I should try out vegan-ism. I would like to throw out a big shout out to whomever came up with these delicious recipes. Especially the guy that came up with the vegan BLT and the chipotle brownie. I cannot express how satisfied I am with those two items. If i could, I would like to shake hands with the creators. Bravo Aux Vivres, never did I think I would be writing this review. Hopefully you guys can sprout amazing locations like this throughout North America. But until then my allegiance lies to Montreal for the best Vegan food!"

Tons of flavour and variety - from heavy to light meals, lunch and dinner, there is something to suit your mood. Yummy desserts and great loose leaf tea selection too. Reminds me of 'Fresh' in Toronto - similar vibe, menu and style."
/user_details?userid=t_BqNiIRFHvYjaWzmy35ZA,Amy H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Super cute vegan diner with ample amount of choice! I had the Thai bowl, but it was a little underwhelming compared to some of the rice bowls I've had at places in Toronto, like Fresh. The flavours were a little bland and nothing really stood out. However, it did taste okay and it was a good, sizeable portion. My friend got the sirocco chipati and it was massive! It's definitely an item you can share amongst two if you aren't extremely hungry. Overall the service was great, the staff really knew the menu items like the back of their hand. I only wish the food was slightly more flavourful!"
/user_details?userid=7Uti7mahLLQtXtq6kJkHIA,Benoit C.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,Tried twice and it disappointed again. The fresh juices were the best things on the menu. I'm vegetarian and this did not really cut it for us. The Dahl soup was so watered down that it didn't taste like much. Just murky water. The chili tasted like they just threw a can of red beans and a can of tomatoes plus some chili powder and they warmed it up for 5 min. Three quarter of the wrap was lettuce the rest was marinated carrots. Service was friendly at first but once we got our food she never came back until the end and the place was not busy. There is potential here but I find that they need to put a bit of love in their cooking. Try Lola Rosa which is hands down the best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal in my opinion.

Luckily on my trip to Montreal, my lovely friend and host is vegetarian and this was the first place she took me to and boy was I pleased!  Aux Vivres is bright and lively, beautifully furnished with a cool trendy atmosphere. Reminds me of a diner but with a brand new juice bar and with wooden furnishings. Tres Cool. There's a good selection of smoothies, fruit juices, espressos, teas, organic everything - then sandwiches, burgers, rice bowls, and more! They even had a glossary of terms for non-vegans like me that don't know what Tempeh was! I got the Tofu Burger ($11) with an Organic Soda (2.50). The Tofu burger has this great oniony/mustardy spread and it came with yummy hand cut chunky wedges with a chipotle tomato sauce, and some coleslaw. Everything was pretty tasty - but I kinda looked over and wish I'd gotten the Aux Vivre burger now!  My friend got a Souvlakian plate(?) and she said it was really good. All in all DEFINITELY would come back here, get a smoothie and try a bowl - the food is so bright, colorful and healthy it makes me happy to not have any Poutine for awhile!"
/user_details?userid=JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,Clare L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Shame on me for not coming here sooner. The truth is though, I thought this place was a militant vegan place that would smell the seafood-eating fear in me if I dared to walk through the place. (I'm serious) It turned out to be this sunny looking place with abundant seating.Unlike others I was with, who favoured the revered dragon bowl, I wanted to venture out and got me a Macro Bowl. It was delish but I admit, I like seaweed (wakame) in its natural state and then they had me at the miso-tahini sauce, which is a super combo in my opinion.We ordered a banana chocolate pie to split, and as a crust-head (yes I've coined a new term for those who enjoy crust) it was yummy, pie was a bit too sweet but the smooth and creaminess was very WOW, and I am glad that we split it four ways, otherwise, I would have been groaning the way home. One of the best parts of the meal I think is how awesome the server was, I don't know her name, but she was not only attentive to our water needs, but she was friendly and non-pushy.  She also was honest about her favourites when asked, and seemed very genuine. We also had a baby at the table, and she provided the baby chair thingy no questions asked, (can you tell I wasn't the mother? hahaha ""thingy"").  Overall I had a lovely time here, and will definitely come back for MOAR!Rumour also has it that they have a beautiful terrace, but I didn't venture there."

/user_details?userid=ct_FaVZtLhTL1TUOP3UdKA,Marie K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I like Aux Vivres, but I think it needs to challenge itself a bit and improve it's food. Vegan food does not have to be just ""good for vegan food"". Having lived in Portland, Oregon, I've had some amazing meals in vegan restaurants. I understand that the vegan culture in Portland is way more prevalent leading to more competition and therefore leading to restaurants having to challenge themselves and make the best tasting and more creative options on their menus. I think what Aux Vivres lacks is that healthy competition in the city.I had the Aux Vivres burger for my main. The patty itself was good, although the consistency was a bit dry and crumbly. the potato wedges it came with lacked taste and were not prepared properly. they were not crispy at all. I only ate three. The dessert I had was the Chipotle brownie and it was definitely delicious! So, quick conclusion: great try, first of its kind in Montreal, obviously there is a large market for this kind of restaurant considering how there are consistently line-ups to get a table. Perhaps a little bit of competition in the city would make them ""up"" their game a bit."

They make everything themselves, including the ketchup! In the week we were in Montreal, we went there 3 times just because there were so many things we wanted to try. They have a special on every day and we tried it twice and it was delicious! The paratha with homemade veggie butter is not to be missed and their juices and smoothies are excellent. They also sell take outs and desserts as well as their own sauces next door. The only problems are that because the place is very popular, there is a long line up after 7pm, and the tables are quite small and close together so you end up hearing everything that happens around you. On the first night, we had to put up with a loud couple who on top of that were rude to the server so it was off putting. The restaurant is also quite noisy. All the desserts we tried were amazing.

Was great. I went with Amanda, my girlfriend who wants to be included in this review. She thinks i was rude to the waitress but I wasnt."

Yes, I love poutine and crepes, but if you want some amazing veggie comfort food come here! Every time I'm in town this is a go to spot. The staff is very welcoming and always gives us a booth in the back(which is less crowded and more intimate than the front of the house). The chili is very good, the vegan soups hit the spot( if you make trips up to Montreal in the cold months esp., as my husband and I always seem to.)  The veggie burger is homemade (unlike the frozen stuff you get elsewhere).  I have not tried their brunch yet, but I will next time I'm in town. Also Blvd. Saint Laurent and Saint Denis are filled with nice shops, eateries, coffee houses, so you could spend a whole just food hopping and absorbing the culture. If you're driving, you can find parking on the side streets off of Blvd. Saint-Laurent."
/user_details?userid=tYiCbUoZR4H0XiWCyCypXw,Dustin W.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,Aux Vivres is a great spot- crowded- so we aren't the only ones who think so.We needed something relatively healthy after many hours in the car travelling from the U.S. and this place definitely delivered in both taste and portion. The burgers are huge- HUGE- and really tasty. I had the Burger Aux Vivres- very veggy-y and tasted amazing. The handcut fries are a great touch as well as the homemade ketchup. Really no drawback to this place- other than it's popular- so you might have to wait a bit before getting a seat. Absolutely would go back.

That means I ate safely here without worrying about eggs or milk ingredients. During a recent last-minute escapade to Montreal and after a night of fine red wines, sangrias and la terrasse, my friends and I woke up and came here for brunch.  My girls are awesome, totally not vegan, but was totally agreeable in coming here because I wanted to check this place out so badly before departing the city the same day. The place was packed around noon on a rainy Sunday morning and we waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waitress was rude, maybe she didn't like anglophones.. BUT we spoke FRENCH to her, so it's totally NOT us.I ordered a brunch option called Le Complet, which came with a side salade with green dressing, stir-fry tofu, fake bacon, and corn bread. While my ladies found the stir-fry tofu amazing, I found it a tad bland, the corn bread was good, fake bacon was meh, BUT the side salad was amazing, it was fresh and crisp and the green dressing was divine. This meal also came with coffee or chai, so I chose the chai because it was vegan friendly and I could have my coffee black anytime!We finished our meal with Gateau Faux-mage... fake cheesecake. It tasted exactly like a real cheesecake.. only less sweet and totally better for you because it's vegan and soy... and probably made with cane-sugar, not the refine white sugar crap.I would MOST DEF come back here. If only I lived in Montreal. This city has blown me away, I did not know it was veggie-friendly!! :) *LOVE*Montreal, je t'aime! *bisoux* A la prochaine!"

My little girl loved it too. Granted, she spent the whole time sucking down a mango lassi and eating a wee bit of cornbread. I did wish there were a few kid friendly options.

It didn't seem healthy food to me, the dragon bowl certainly was, although the rest seemed to be a one way trip to gut city.  Maybe I just need to order different dishes to get a better experience , but I'm not gonna try again until next time in montreal."

The decor was a bit of a snooze-fest, vinyl booths and regular ol' tables and chairs.  All in all an average experience, but I'd go back again and try something else next time."

To the owner... so sorry for the one star but we are restaurant professionals who know blatant contempt when we see it. Not sure what her problem with us was other then that we did not speak French. We try to come to Montreal every summer so perhaps after our next visit, if your host staff treats us fairly, you'll get the five stars you deserve.Update, looks like we're not going to get to Montreal this year.

I loved the BLT, buddha bowl, thai bowl, bombay banana, mango lassi, and chocolate smoothie. Food disappointments were the veggie lox sandwich (done well but not something I would normally crave) and the cafe frappe (the flavor wasn't quite right for some reason; maybe too much soy milk).During my recent vacation in Montreal, I sat at various times at the counter, in the dining room, and on the terrace. I visited for both lunch and dinner, and never had to wait, although the dining room was often near capacity. The interior of the restaurant is nice, although the layout is quirky, and one of our tables was right below an air conditioner that gave us the chills.

My personal favourite meal here is the mekong wrap with a creamsicle smoothie. Delicious. Corn bread with guac is a solid starter. One thing I always find bizarre though, is that when ever I upgrade from bread to the chapati wrap, the wraps are in fact just made of pita. This has happened several times. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm pretty sure that chapatis and pitas are not generally considered to be one and the same. Note to Aux Vivres chefs/menu-makers, if you are reading this: Miriam Webster defines 'chapati' as ""a round flat unleavened bread of India that is usually made of whole wheat flour and cooked on a griddle"". Just thought you should know.  The chana 'chapati' is also very good, though can get pretty soggy (again, this may be because it is in a pita, not a chapati). Personally, I enjoy sitting at the counter (or anywhere on the lefthand side of this place), but hey, it's all good."

My server told my indecisive self to go with the tempeh burger, served with excellent cole slaw, chipotle ketchup, and potato wedges ($9), and I'm happy I did. Fantastic. And it's absolutely massive, so prepare to enjoy the glory of a light-night snack!It's a great place to take yourself on a solo date too.

Giancarla had the Dragon Bowl and thought it was ""excellent."" She felt the cabbage and the carrots and the sauce that came with it were ""so fresh"" and not ""vegetabl-ey.""  She went on to say, ""the dressing was real yummy and the rice on the bottom had some sort of sauce,...I didn't know what it was, but loved it anyway.""Sondre had the Buddha Bowl and states, ""I come from this with a perspective of someone who's not a vegetarian or vegan, but I like exploring and I thought it looked like a great establishment and I was VERY impressed.  I'd say it was Ace. I felt very good about the meal and I'd never had tofu like that before.  [the tofu] Tasted so good.  And the healthy portion of broccoli is always a plus.  You know me, I'm not big on dressings and dips and all that shit, but this sauce was perfect.  The stuff on the rice was super good and I liked all those pumpkin seeds.  It felt like a full, hearty, and healthy meal.""As for me, I had the Thai Bowl and was real happy with all the carrots, those big stems of bok choy, the brown rice, the peanut sauce, and tofu, but I must say, If I were to do it all over again, I'd go with the Buddha Bowl.  I was so jealous of all that broccoli!  (Luckily, Sondre was kind enough to share)  The Bowls are definitely big enough to share or take half home for the van ride later, so keep that in mind when yer planning ahead to your post-show-midnight-meal.  All 3 of us got the fresh juices and were blown away. Sondre and Giancarla got the TONIC (Apple, Lemon, Ginger) which was super spicy and made them feel like it was immediately working on repairing the throat and boosting their sinus immunity.  A+!   I was elated to drink the (Apple, Carrot, Beet) juice cuz I know Beets are so good for me. Health...in a glass.  Sondre even went nuts an ordered a fancy green tea on top of all that (for his pipes).  He was in a decadent beverage heaven, of which, he'd make a solitary promise to re-visit as often as possible through the consumption of fresh and healthy juices around the country; or die trying.  (at least that's what his expression supposed)We didn't have time to eat dessert, but I can't imagine it'd be anything less than ""fett.""GO EAT HERE!!!!~Dave ""Herremannen"" Heilman"

Luckily for me and the Yelpers who are reading this, I managed to get my booty to the establishment last week, and what a gem this place is! Pretty cute place I have to say, with equally cute employers. I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to throw that in there, but really you should all be checking out this vegan hotspot for its, ahem, food. My friend and I split the Aux Vivres burger and Mekong wrap, which equalled glorious choices on our parts. In the past, I've had the Dragon and Thai bowls, and oh man....even when made 45-60 minutes earlier (thanks SLOW delivery service!), they were still brilliant dishes. To end this lil review, I will most definitely return to delight in more vegan cuisine. After all, I love healthy food and this food will make you feel good.

Soup was also really tasty and satisfying on a cold November day.  I'd definitely recommend it for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike."
/user_details?userid=W8SbalWuHUcr2kjxHu3oAA,Mardou F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Pretentious, boring, contradictory.  Their menu totes ""freshest ingredients, giving priority to local and seasonal produce, to create surprising flavour combinations and unusual dishes that you won't find anywhere else.""  This statement is a stretch by any means, I have been to many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, that have blown my mind with unique and innovative cooking. This is not one of them. Tofu and tempeh burgers are a dime a dozen. As are asian fusion bowls but not with the hefty price tag of 13 to 15 dollars, for a veggy bowl. What is local or seasonal about daikon, dulce or wakame? Let's be honest about what this restaurant truly is; it does not cater to much of the vegan crowd, because most vegans wouldn't pay the inflated prices for things they could easily make at home.  Most vegans and vegetarians have had their share of tofu and tempeh burgers, if not a few hundred veggie bowls. Therefore, lets truthfully admit that this restaurant caters to the curiosity of non vegan and vegetarians offering trendy fare at a price. The staff were rather aloof, and had us standing at the host station for 10 minutes, while looking over a virtually empty restaurant. Furthermore when we were seated by who we thought to be our server, she said nothing to us and walked away from the table after seating. She then returned  with a bottle of water (for 3 of us)filling our glasses with water and walked away. 20 min later our glasses were empty and we were still waiting to order. When we finally made eye contact with one of the other employees behind the juice bar(who was leisurely chatting with other staff behind the bar), the original host/server finally came over and begrudgingly  took our order. After our food arrived our water glasses remained empty ( we think that they only allowed us one bottle of water because they expected us to buy drinks, such as $4.50 for 8oz of juice) and no one came to check on us to see if the food or order was to our satisfaction. To top it off the server had forgotten to bring a bowl of soup, but didn't realize.  Then another sever showed up at the table with soup in hand after we had already finished our meal.  After asking him to pack it to go, he returned with the bill and has the audacity to start chatting us up, almost as thought he was hoping to get a good tip. WTF?!The food was satisfactory, but all in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths and a hole in our wallets."

I think I may have actually dreamed about their roasted cornbread. It's hearty and slightly spicy served with a vegan butter sauce. I recommend this in combination with the GIANT veggie chili served with guacamole. It keeps very well overnight. Their macro bowl is also particularly good. It is a cleverly conceived combination of fresh organic veggies over steamed brown rice. To my taste, I think this dish could be improved (ever so slightly) with some enoki mushrooms, but I'm not sure how those fly with the macro lifestyle.  As for the ambiance, I very much enjoy their summer patio. They've done very nicely with it."

Seriously, the BLT is as big as your head, and if you close your eyes, it tastes like real bacon. Not for nothing though, I find that a lot of the place's sauces are overly-acidic. The magnificently-crafted Thai Rice Bowl is somewhat diminished by what I see as a saucing that should be slightly thicker, and a little more ""peanut-"" Despite this, and no pun intended, this place is awesome sauce."

Granted we were a group of  7, not as easy to seat, but I feel that with better seating management and planning this could have been avoided. People with only 2 or 3 were constantly given priority over us and then there was a couple who walked right by the line of about 15 people, went up to the hostess whom they obviously knew, and were immediately seated at a table that was just cleared. When we were seated they tried to fit us at a 4-seater table even though the table next to us was free. So we pulled it over and made it work, which noticeably pissed the waitress off and would explain the extra slow service and attitude we got that night.As soon as we got our food though all was forgiven... or at least forgotten :) And yes I do plan on returning, several times, although I will probably avoid going in a larger group and Thurs-Sat evenings.

Originally fashioned as a sandwich and smoothie bar (and still retaining these qualities), Michael Makhan (owner, chef, menu designer) expanded to a full size restaurant in 2005.Although the entire menu is strong, Aux Vivres remains strongest in their fundamentals: sandwiches. The BLT (with smoked coconut bacon) is a must, and the option to put it on chapati should not be an option - there is no other way to have it. Two of their seitan based sandwiches are among my faves: their Montreal smoked meat, and their gyro. I know some meat eaters would cringe at the thought of using a meat substitute in such venerated meals - but trust me, your palate will thank you.In other options are their bowls, which while good, I'm not overly blown away by, as this is closer to something I can make on my own. The dragon bowl is probably the best here.In their comfort foods section, their chilli and chilli fries are both great, as well as their ""Mumbai plate"", a terrific fusion dish of Indian flavours.The only downside is that they have no alcohol license (bring your own nor table service), and the setting is just not that welcoming for languishing after a meal.

But Aux Vivres does just that in their rice bowls, particularly the Thai and Macro options. I make it a point to have a meal here every time I'm in Montreal. I initially came for the chapati wrapped sandwiches (especially the CLT, duh!), but since finding out about a gluten intolerance, I also really appreciate that Aux Vivres makes it very clear which items are g-free on their menu. Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I ordered the Thai bowl with smoked coconut on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Sirocco and a salad. The food came quickly, the service was great, and we didn't feel rushed. The dressings and sauces were very unique and tasty... and I liked the light marinade they used on my tofu.

I'm currently on a diet and it's tough. It's tough because I can't find what to do except boring salads and healthy sandwiches. Well Aux Vivres has a great variety in the menu. One of the complaint I always do about vegan/vegetarian it's that they hide they crave for meat by creating a weird toffu mixt simili-meat veggie version. I didn't felt that feeling about Aux Vivres. It has a heavy hippie cuisine flavour to it. Really creative vegan cuisine. Slightly asian inspired but also being audacious in some great smoothes (One with Celery, Mango and other stuff I can't remember and tasing awesome is pretty bold. Great portion an UBER-CHEAP.

Une des plaintes que j'ai de la cuisine Végét (Arien ou Alien) c'est l'obsession de créer des mets qui contient de la simili-viande parce qu'ils sont intrinsèquement carnivore-endormi. Je n'ai pas eut ce feeling chez Aux Vivres. Au contraire, on démontre un menu risqué mais simple avec des plats du jour. Des smoothies qui combien céleri et fruits exotiques - bizarrement délicieux. Il y a une certaine twist asiatique et même fusion mais c'est surtout de la cuisine de hippies avec une tournure bien végétalienne.

During my week's visit to Montreal, trying Aux Vivres was one of the most prominent things on my agenda. It sounds silly, but vegan restaurants like this do not come around often in Canada. Vegans, picture going into a restaurant, and being able to eat anything on the menu ever. This drove me crazy. After much debate, I eventually settled for the Kosmo's Plate- an incredible array of seitan, tzatziki, potato wedges, greek salad, rice, etc. I finished off my meal with a pot of soothing chamomile, and the BEST slice of gateau faux-mage (uncheesecake), I have ever been served in a restaurant in my life. I mean that, and I have been to some pretty famous vegan restaurants in my time. That makes me sound like an old woman. I am also a vegan baker myself, and wouldn't have done much differently. When Montreal and its charming swagger finally wins me over and I decide to move there on a whim one day, this is where I will take all of my non-vegan friends to convert them, and where all of my food dates ever will be.

Ginger cookie is a must.Ambience is slightly lacking, but the good food and prices make up for it!Aux Vivres is our go-to vege takeout spot."
/user_details?userid=0tG4VweWLscJjrAXA2wvYg,Melissa K.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"I went here on my recent weekend trip to Montreal after read recs on yelp. We went pretty out of our way to go here for lunch and we enjoyed it but were not blown away. We shared the cold plate with a delicious veg pate, hummus, veggie puree, and a veg lox which I was less excited about. We also split a seitan sandwich was good and a choc coconut smoothie. Would love to have a place like this near me, but again did not fee like a place worth walking 25 blocks out of our way."
/user_details?userid=EkGLFcLxzT8BGQ4KffaYgQ,Michael A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"The food here was good.  We started off with an order of cornbread, which I thought was fantastic.  I would never have guessed it was vegan if I didn't know.  The 'butter' didn't really taste buttery but I liked it.  I had a Dragon Bowl and my girlfriend had a veggie burger.  The dragon bowl was the better of the two.  I wish I had a chance to try the coconut bacon but they were all out that night.  Service was good, but the best part was that everything was pretty cheap."
/user_details?userid=puSIiIvSaaadOvSerYOJdw,Hannah S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This place was amazing. The food was great and the menu had a wide range of options, inspired by Indian, Greek, Thai, Chinese and Mediterranean cuisines, to name a few. I had the Sirocco wrap, which was okay, and my boyfriend had the Dragon bowl, which was awesome. I was pretty jealous. I wish I'd tried the BLT -- it's got good reviews here, and a good vegan BLT is so hard to find."
/user_details?userid=Jtfz1WbIB_FtYDkO3MtRXg,Yolanda Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Very delicious, fresh, vegan, awesome food.  The service was very friendly, attentive, and really fast.  Not only is the food great, but there is also a variety of cool teas to go along with it.  Decent portions and again very fresh. Relatively inexpensive.  There's an awesome seating area ouside in the back.  Also, I discovered you can catch very fast WIFI in there, so if you're looking for sweet sweet internet you'll find it here as well.  CLOSED MONDAY."

The choices were overwheleming and as an all Vegan rest I was giddy! Ended up going back the second nigth too. The Tempeh Burger was great and tasty, the portabella burger was amazing too.   Carrot juice brought life back into my soul. I am grateful for place like this when I travel. Helps me survive the madness. Staff was great and service was perfect. Love love loved it"
/user_details?userid=CTjVOFwYTb6J3AA3_I5rgg,eriquita P.,"Frankfurt, Germany",4 star rating,"I have nothing but praise for my favourite little vegan hotspot on the Plateau - and Aux Vivres should not disappoint a grumbling (and earth-friendly) appetite. Their ingredients are super fresh, and I mean ""crunchy"" fresh. Salads are great. Also tried their pizza, which was served semi-warm but delicious nonetheless.. sometimes it's hard to believe they can substitute animal ingredients out and still be hearty - but they deliver. A+"

/user_details?userid=7XTbyzvIU5RNeVqn7jF5UA,Lily O.,"Anchorage, AK",4 star rating,"A large very creative selection of vegetarian friendly food! Me and my friend ordered the Dragon rice bowl and a Chana wrap. The Dragon rice bowl was a little complicated for my tastes, (But thats completely  at the fault of me for ordering it, since I knew what I was getting) But I still really enjoyed all the fresh tasty vegetables on it. But WARNING: Those rice bowls could feed a family, if you're thinking about sharing it instead of ordering two, sharing would be the better option. The Chana was warm flavorful and something I could eat again and again. Plus they have a lovely selection of pastries which I have to go back to try!  OMG I almost forgot about the service too. It was so incredibly fast. My friend and I went to the restroom and when we came back the food was already at our places. It must have been less than 5 minutes. I've never had service so fast. The waitresses were also very smily and helpful when we were having troubles with the credit card machine. :D Great restaurant! If you're a vegetarian its a must!"

The waitress was randomly pick customer to serve instead of seating customer in order. The food is very average, but i guess there is really not much vegan places in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=eR_iHXFL9nvJeI2EJMXB9A,Soumaya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I live the food here... I even crave it. I always have the BLT on chapati and the dragon bowl with tofu. I have seen this restaurant go from a small business to a full blown money Nanking restaurant. The I Lu thing that bothers me is that they are constantly raisin their prices... The food used to be made fresh and seemed to be made with live and now it seems to be mass produced and the quality is going down a bit. I will continue to go there until either the price becomes unaffordable or when I just stop craving the food. But I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone even non vegetarian people can eat here and learn how to eat tasty healthy foods.

/user_details?userid=8-U6FgqWxNmXz80JhJQXZg,Emily U.,"Indianapolis, IN",5 star rating,"Vegan vittles have never tasted so good as they do at this bright cheery cafe. I went here on my birthday after reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The waitress told us that the recipe for the sauce on the Dragon Bowl was a secret and it wasn't hard to figure out why--it was amazing! It tasted like the love child of tahini, sesame oil and several other things I'd love to identify. With a pile of veggies and rice, it was a party in my mouth! We also tried a Thai peanut salad with tempeh, which was also delicious, and their ""Tonique""--a blend of apple, lemon and ginger juices. This was probably the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Why can't making healthy choices always taste this good? I plan to try and replicate the dragon sauce and Tonique at home, but it's hard to imagine my own efforts would stand up to the amazing Aux Vivres. The rest of their menu looked as enticing as what we had. I'd probably be in danger of going here 2-3 times per week if I lived in Montreal. Happy birthday to me!"

/user_details?userid=xs5HZPnhPZ0FENv_d5X79g,S J.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,"We ate brunch on a Saturday morning at Aux Vivres during a short trip to Montreal. We sat in the back garden, which was really nice. Loved seeing basil and tomatoes growing in their boxes instead of fancy flowers. My bf and I shared the waffles and the polenta cakes brunch options - and both were very very good. We loved the cashew cream and fruit topping that came with the waffles. Normally I hate polenta anything, but their's was delicious, as was the guac that came with it. My only minor complaint would be that the black beans not be pureed, but served whole, but the dish was still good. The mango lassi we had was excellent - not too sweet, and with yummy pieces of real fruit in it! We also tried the coconut ""bacon"" on the side, out of curiosity - it was interesting and nice - it would have been great as part of a trail mix. My bf (who is not vegan) said the waffles were one of the best brunches he'd had anywhere. The prices ($10-$11 per brunch plate, which included coffee!) and service was also fantastic. If we get to Montreal again, we will definitely go back."
