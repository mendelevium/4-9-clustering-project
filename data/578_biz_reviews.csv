/user_details?userid=3Ub2afHVLPPg3Zs652ovdQ,Sébastien G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the Vietnamese restaurant of Montreal! They have great Pho, but what makes it special is that they have Vietnamese specialties I have never seen anywhere else. They are surprising because it's not a taste we are used to, but they are so tasty, well worth a try. Try the La Vong Fish, it's really something special and tasty.The specialties are a little pricier (~16$ a plate), but they are meant to be shared between persons Vietnamese style. Other than these plates the rest of the prices are in line with other Viets (~9$ Pho, ~12$ grilled meat or crispy noodles).The staff is always friendly, some of them might struggle with french or english, but we always end up understanding each-other.They recently added Sushis to their menu, I'm not sure what these have to do with Vietnamese, but while talking to the owner I believe he gave in to market pressure to have them (""Asian"" restaurant should have sushis??). Tried them one or two times and they were fine,  but I'm not a big sushi guy and the real Vietnamese stuff on their menu is so good I can't justify not to eat that!PS. This is a ""bring your own wine"" restaurant, but I couldn't find that option on Yelp"

It was amazing. Lots of big snail chunks with the flavorful tomato-y soup. The soup I got also had these squid cakes. Those were SO GOOD! They have a soup with only those. I really recommend getting that one (#S5). We also got a spicy soup, way too spicy for me, but still amazing taste. As well as spring rolls. Not expensive and very good service."

Today i order as as appertizer long doi (pork intestine sausage) but these doesn't really impressed me because it is enough tender. The fishes pastes is not enough cruncry. Anyways gonna give another chance to try other meals...

We all shared some Vietnamese specialties which were good. We had fried Fish cakes with turmeric and dill, bourgot soup and some fried intestine, a specialty that I didn't dare touch. I uncle loves it and order it every time he comes here. I must say I wasn't impressed by it. The true test for me it the pho. So I guess I'll have to come back to try it out."
/user_details?userid=Xgnkm6ryeHNtdIlpPJ5YqQ,Huyn N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really good food and service. I forgot to take a photo of the vermicelli with grilled meat ( called Bun cha) and the Avocado smoothie (sinh to bo). The Bun cha one is really good, it's similar to the one I had in Vietnam which is authentic. The grilled meat has smoked flavor and tender. Add to that, it has rich flavor because it is pork belly (I believe). In order to balance it, it goes with sour and sweet fish sauce which has some pickled vegetables and that's my favorite thing. For the hand pouding grilled squid vermicelli or we called it Bun cha ca muc, the broth is super super good. It's light and tender and goes well with seafood flavor. Last but not least, the fried chicken with fish sauce, I made it several times at home but it couldn't compare to this dishes  nice seasoning! One more thing, they have discounts in every Tuesday which is 50% for the 2nd main dishes (excluding desert and snacks). For the price, they have a little higher price than some Vietnamese restaurants that I know, but it worth it. To be honest, I have to come back here every week! Good job"
/user_details?userid=EZf49QD93REeDBSoCO9Fzw,Jolie V.,"West Edmonton, Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty decent Vietnamese restaurant with better viet food than you'd normally have. Had really good bun bo hue, although it could have been a bit spicier. Pricing wise it's like every other restaurant. Their che ba mau is good, although it could use a bit more coconut flavouring (in my opinion). Service was pretty good for a viet restaurant, and it has a very relaxed atmosphere. Parking might be a bit hard to find depending on when you go, so definitely be prepared to walk."

/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Small Vietnamese restaurants that also churns out a lot of pan-Asian dishes to attract a bigger clientele. Stick to the Vietnamese stuff, it's very decent. Me, and my group ordered the grilled blood sausage and the innards, the blood sausage was solid, albeit it could have been a bit more spiced up.The blood and pork congee was average, they weren't slowly braised with the soup, but they were added after. It lacked a certain symbiosis between the different elements.The Bun Cha was good, you take the noodles and some greens and dipped it in the pork and vinegar. It was a solid dish.BYOB3.5 stars."
