/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We ordered this on doordash on a lazy sat for lunch. It's so risky getting fried stuff delivered, but hey, we were desperate and on a fried chicken craving. We ordered a 3 piece (brown meat) and a bag of popcorn chicken. It arrived after 35-40 mins cuz we live a bit far and I was despairing that it would be a soggy, cold, sad mess. Instead, I opened the packaging (super cute btw), and was greeted by 3 gorgeously breaded fried pieces of chicken sitting gloriously on top of massive amounts of perfectly still crispy cavendish fries. How amazing of a chef must you be to keep fried chicken and fries this fresh after a 30 mins drive?! And the taste!! It was ridiculously moist on the inside, still warm (not piping hot of course), and that breading was one of the best I've ever tasted. Light, slight kick of spice, and super crispy. Fries were fantastic as well especially given how quickly cavendish fries can get mushy. These were crisp on the outside, and soft potatoey on the inside. The best part of the meal was the sauces. We ordered hoisin and wildflower hot honey. Holy hell was that wildflower hot honey good!! Had to wrestle it out of my husband's clutches and even then fight over drippings in the box. It's like a fancy Buffalo sauce, but with much higher quality ingredients and an addictive taste that went so well with everything else. Can't speak about service since we doordashed, but prices were a bit on the expensive side. Nonetheless, we now have a new fav spot for high tier fried chicken and it's Roch Le Coq!"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered this last night ! We had a bucket of fried chicken fries, gravy and coleslaw. The chicken was crispy on the outside with great flavour and juicy/perfectly cooked on the inside , the pieces were very generous in size and very meaty/not oily. Fries were good and the gravy was very nice too ! The coleslaw was tasty as well fresh tangy and a touch of sweet. Pricing isn't super cheap but the quality of there and portions are generous. I really enjoyed this !"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Awesome fried chicken counter! It's located just in front of a park with lots of picnic tables so this is a perfect option weather permitting. We order two pieces of brown meat fried chicken, popcorn chicken and the Mega burger. Their fried chicken in general is excellent. It's crispy, well seasoned and tender. The burger was my favorite, the fried chicken patty was sooo good and I loved the sauces and spicy peppers layered on the patty. The fried chicken itself was great and the popcorn chicken was ok, it was a bit dry. They don't have many side dishes but the sauces and coleslaw are great and that's really all we needed. Will certainly be back, highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=iT0lKL00EWx0MX9FvUwyZA,Louis I.,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A whole new spin on fried chicken, We ordered the mixed chicken which came in a bucket with a small container of gravy, a bag of fries,  2 containers of cole slaw and a small sauce that I chose (Spicey honey something), The chicken was well cooked and coated with a crunchy/salty type batter, inside this amazing crust was tender and juicy chicken meat, the gravy was brown type sauce and went well with everything. The fries were thin, small and crunchy and cooked in the same oil as the chicken because it had a chicken taste to them.  The spicey sauce had a definate zing to it and if you like heat with your chicken, this is for you. Cole slaw was traditional style and tasty with a hint of cilantro (I think) which gave it a nice bright fresh taste.  Overall, not cheap but definately worth it and my new go to chicken spot."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The origins of fried chicken in the US traces back to Scottish cuisine where chicken was cooked in fat, and in West African cuisine where it was seasoned and then cooked in palm oil. As early as 1730s, both techniques found their way in to America as the slave trade led Africans to the southern plantations enriching the Scottish cuisine with missing seasoning and spices. After the abolition of slavery and segregation period, it gradually became a general Southern dish.Fast forward to today, Montreal is now endowed with a new eatery built from a team of young entrepreneurs who are preparing one of the best fried chicken in town!Using only fresh, never frozen, chicken from La Ferme les Voltigeurs, it is brined, seasoned, floured and dipped in batter before frying it at 74C/165F which results into piping hot, most flavourful crispy on the outside, with moist and juicy meat on the inside that will satisfy your cravings for southern fried chicken.We were two, trying a mix of platter dark & white meat, which came with fries, cole slaw made with red cabbage, gravy and special sauce made with a ""popular"" red hot sauce augmented with butter and honey. Added to that was an order of popcorn chicken and the ""Rochy"" fried chicken sandwich with soft and pillowy brioche bun. Unfortunately they were out of the pogos, dribbling of cheese and morcels chicken' cordon bleu style encased in a crispy batter... which was alright as meat sweats was setting in but we'll have to return for this along with a promising menu of light cocktails and other beverages. Other than running out on items, there may be some wait time as we're still in soft opening mode.If you're in the Outremont hood, stop by to meet the energetic team:Chef Oussama Ben Tanfous (ex-Enfants Terribles)Guillaume Daly (ex-Sousbois)Philippe Gagné and ChloéCosmas ArroyaveAlexandre MerchoSaber TrikaOne you've been... you'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow!!! If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Came here for lunch with coworkers and was really blown away by both the service and food.We first got the sliders as an appetizer. It was so perfect and delicious. The fried chicken inside was one of the juciest I've ever had, and went so well with the hot sauce and spicy mayo. Next was the main entree of the bucket of fried chicken with sides of slaw, potato salad and fries. What can I say, everything about this was perfect. The flavorful and juicy fried chicken, the crispy red lettuce slaw with green onion and vinegar, fries were not bad either. But let me tell you about the waffle! It was the surprising highlight of the meal, even with all the other amazing knockout dishes. The was so crispy and had the perfect texture on the inside. It went so well with syrup and honestly any other sauce there. If it came with ice cream I would just be in heaven. The owner and the cooks were so nice as well and always checked to see if everything was ok and talk to us about their food.Definitely will bring friends/coworkers here!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"*Crunch* *crunch* *crunch* that's the sound of every bite into this barrel of fried chicken 6-pieces of the mixed barrel had 3 strips of white meat two wings and one drumstick. The batter is sooo crispy crunchy--even after a 15-min drive home! The fries are crispy coated, and I can't get enough of that! Goes well slathered with the buttery ever so slightly sweet gravy. And just to feel healthy, there are 2 fresh purple slaw sides with cilantro and green onions--great combo! It didn't disappoint, but the seasoning in the chicken batter is definitely a discovery taste for me (it's not like KFC) and unique in its own way. Just call 15 min before going to pick up your order and it'll be waiting for you at the counter ready to go! Was worth our little drive to pick it up! (That's about the extent of our ""going out on date night"" is gonna be for this little while!!!)"

The staff was on point, the food was more the amazing.The location is nice, a little out of the way but if you go earlier you can walk around and look at the shops in the area. Inside is a little small, we were seated at the only booth and for two larger men it was perfect. It can fit 4 easily. Most of their clients seem to be take out so take that into consideration if you plan to arrive as a large group.They have a rich slider, I had it as desert and man on man was that juicy and full of flavour.I seriously can not recommend these guys, more.I unfortunately don't have any pictures because we couldn't not wait.My boy and I shared the 6 piece and I could have gone for the 8, hit the gym come on over and split the 8 you won't be disappointed. They also offer to refill your sauces so don't be shy.--- Update, 2nd time going after two months and OMG their chicken is still top quality. They have hired a lot of people and the food comes out faster and still the superb quality you'd expect. They are doing great! Next up, having their homemade sauces, potatoes and slaw in take home packages  --- Update, This is my 3rd adventure into this marvellous fried chicken den of paradise and the secret ingredients still eludes me. My quest remains a success, I've been well fed and after this coma, and the chicken child that will be born from my very soul. Long story short, foooood is still in point! Quality control is doing their work and I've never been happier to eat anywhere. When people spoke of soul food around me. I never understood. Now, I do."

We got the 6 pieces fried chicken bucket and it came with purple cabbage slaw, potato salad, fries and gravy. We asked for the spicy sauce and the kimchi mayo and the kimchi mayo was the bomb! The purple cabbage slaw was so fresh and so yum! The fried Chicken was crispy and good too. The fries were crisp and reminded me of the ones u get at Costco so I was super happy. Got all of this for about $28 including tax!"

He speaks English and French. And understood exactly what I wanted and was quite patient seeing that it was my first time. It was super crowded, which I hear it's always crowded but the chicken sandwich was amazing you can tell that they seasoned the meat and the flower and or batter. Yummmm The fried chicken wings even two days later fresh out the refrigerator were very tasty very flavorful and I enjoy the texture I wish there are more authentic places like this in the states maybe there are and I just haven't found them I don't know."
/user_details?userid=Gc3iwri5IIl4RDYsjGyGjw,Ralph L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I feel the test of a excellent chef is to take very popular dishes and make them perfectly. Roch le Coq you win. Fried chicken to perfection. Crispy and tasty batter with perfectly cooked chicken. The fries are crispy and flavourful. The coleslaw is extra special, red cabbage with a spicy dressing, so fresh! The gravy was real! The bbq hoisin sauce was adventurous. Just plain excellent. Bravo!"
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally! Whenever a fried chicken joint opens up in Montreal, I cry tears of happiness (Montreal for some reason lacks fried chicken places and seems to prefer rotisserie over fried). When I found out about this place, I told my friends we HAD to try this out. So an Uber ride away, we ended up here.The guy working the cashier was EXTREMELY helpful in suggesting what worked with us and what suggestions we should get. We went with the traditional fried chicken, and Popcorn chicken. I personally really liked the popcorn chicken, and the dark meat pieces of fried chicken. This place felt like it made solid and clean fried chicken, perfect for any fried chicken connoisseur. Their fries were also amazing, and were a highlight of this meal. My only lil negative critique was that they didn't have biscuits nor a spicy option for their fried chicken, but nevertheless this is a solid place!"

If your New Year's resolution was to get fat, Roch le Coq in Outremont is the place. Tiny place with 4 tables.  Most of the people are doing takeout. During mealtimes there's a line out the door.  Used 5 napkins and now need a shower, but OH MY!"

That said, my issue is that there must be some type of drug in their food that gets their clients addicted because I am a straight up addict! ;)Good job boys, keep it up!"

/user_details?userid=j_ywrYvgiy63z1paw-ToUQ,John G.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had read a few write-ups about this new fried chicken outlet in Outremont and made a mad dash from McGill after an evening class to check it out. I am a fried chicken afficienado from waayyyy back, my mom's favorite eat-out dish and for which I keep looking out for. Well, Oussama, Guillaume and their crew turn out some pretty amazing fried chicken for their tiny, 580 square foot establishment. Even though it officially closes at 9 PM, I showed up around 9:10 and Oussama enticed me to stick around, saying they had a batch of chicken being prepared for friends who had dropped by, and he would be pleased to prepare a 3-piece trio for me. Well, Mom, I found fried chicken you would absolutely adore! Those 3 pieces of chicken were devoured, crispy batter and all! A BBQ hoisin sauce with one of Montreal's better fries completed the evening dinner. And, yes, most definitely worth a return visit, sooner than later! Great job, Oussama and Guillaume! Definitely a winner in my books!"
/user_details?userid=ggl-d6DodXCmZVt5VJZAdg,Joe N.,"Mount Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"All About The MarginsHonestly, I've been coming to this place for a while now, and I gotta say, Roch Le Coq serves up the BEST friend chicken in Montreal by a long shot! Let that be said loud and clear. The only reason why this place doesn't get a 5-Star is because of their cheapness... Let me elaborate.. Your paying top dollar relative  to other friend chicken places which is ok because you are getting quality. However, when you have portions that will only fill up a baby's stomach, theirs something wrong...The portion of fries you get is MEASLY when you order a bucket of 10 pieces.. it just doesn't add up. Cheap is the only word that comes to mind. When given gravy, they fill up half the little container... why don't you fill the WHOLE thing? What are you losing?...If they up their portion size of their fries and sides, I'll have no choice but to change this review to 5-stars. But for now their cheapness is the only thing hindering them. P.S. To the blonde guy with the curly hair, your a super nice guy so don't take this the wrong way but please wear a cap... for nCorona's sake"

Perfectly seasoned. Not overly greasy. Just couldn't wait for the next bite. And don't forget those delicious fries too!And get this...my friend ordered a popcorn chicken poutine (which I tasted and loved too). While we were eating, one of the guys came over and offered to add more gravy to his poutine if he wanted (which he gracefully accepted). Never seen that before! Just goes to show how much they care about making their customers happy."

I ordered a bucket of 10 white meat for me and my family. The gravy is simply incredible!! I would buy a 2 litre of it if I could . The chicken was great! Boneless and tasty. But some of the (half ) were not completely battered, so some of the pieces were deep fried with half batter meaning the white meat got a little dry. Otherwise I it was perfect! Easily the best fried chicken in Quebec! Expensive but worth it!"
