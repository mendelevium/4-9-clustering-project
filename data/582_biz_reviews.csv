La société Montreal has oysters special from Monday to Friday ,5-7pm. 1.25$ each. We didn't order any other food other than the oysters and a bottle of white wine. Oyster were pretty fresh. The restaurant environment is good as well.  I recommend people to have a drink after work."
/user_details?userid=b9Q74D4XvFjJHKvLBLSaEA,Shannon W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4 star rating,"I was very pleased with this place. We arrived around 10pm on a Sunday evening and asked to be seated in the bar area (there's a bar area to the left and a dining room to the right). The waitress sat us in  the back of the room past the bar. I was immediately smitten from the second we sat down. There were sexy pictures aligning the back walls and the seating reminded me of being in Paris. The wine prices were very reasonable, so we started with a 2016 Chablis, which was fantastic. The waitress said I made a good choice (I know my French wines!)For dinner we ordered the duck rillette and foie gras parfait, the salmon tartare and the Icelandic cod fillet. Everything was fantastic. The duck rillette was outstanding, I wish more restaurants in NYC had this on the menu. It had the consistency of high end tuna, but (obviously) tasted like duck. Delightful. The dish came with little pieces of mini burger buns and fig chutney for the foie gras. The salmon tartare was also excellent. The fish tasted nice and fresh and was perfect for a nice summer dish. The Icelandic cod was fantastic. The fish was pan roasted and came with a delightful, creamy sauce on top. It was nice and flaky and fell apart very easily. Yum! The dish also came with a few veggies and about 6 little clams.Service was great and the place itself was super cute. Very enjoyable late night dinner!"

The service is friendly, caring and helpful. In their menu, there was no Benedict without meat, so our waitress suggested that they can make a plate and won't add the ham. I thought it was nice of her to make the suggestion. Sadly, the food was not up to par as the beautiful looking restaurant and great service. The presentation of the food was not special. My friend got a mimosa but it full of pulp that drink itself. My Florentine Benedict was too dry; the hollandaise sauce too thick and unflavored. Potatoes on the side were over cooked. The best part of my plate was my salad. It was tangy, but with sweet touch grape (sweet) made the whole world difference. My friends bagel with lox and cream cheese plus capers and red onions was good. As me, she wasn't a fan of the side potatoes. I was glad to try this restaurant, which was on my list."

French food is probably my favourite and I really love it but this place left me somewhat disappointed. I had my favourite tartar and snails in bone marrow and my gf had a steak. I really didn't like the bone marrow/snail combo I think it was just rich on rich so I found it to be too heavy. Tartar was just ok, but not good. Steak was nothing special, I probably could've made the same one myself.Prices are average. Overall not bad but I was somewhat disappointed"

Waiter was super nice and he got our orders quickly. Drinks are a bit pricy but aesthetically pleasing. Ideal location, super close to shops in Downtown Montreal. Oysters were obviously fresh but a little small, but that's expected for something so cheap! Came at a time where not many people were dining so service was fast. 5-8 oysters will be on my list for when I visit next!"
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",4 star rating,"A rock solid menu and sophisticated service await​ you at La Société Montréal.La Société Bistro is situated in the heart of the downtown core, which is hardly trendy restaurant central. Yet with the Holt Renfrew/Ogilvy expansion on the horizon, this sleepy block of Mountain Street will soon transform into THE indulgence​ shopping destination, making the restaurant's spot one to covet to be certain. The restaurant​ itself has a Hollywood​ meets Mid Town Manhattan vibe and smart service to boot. I arrived on a busy Monday at lunch hour and it was rather noisy, probably due to the high glass ceiling. Still, the aroma​ of grilled Steak floating​ through the air wrapped around me like a triple Fat Goose Parka​. The terrific company I had in tow only added to the enjoyment. The table​ started with the Beef Tartare (because​ we are in Montreal after all)​. $18.00 nets you a​ 120g portion of pristine Candian Angus hand cut and tossed together in Salt and Capers and plated oddly with Tortilla Chips which were slightly stale. We ended up eating the Tartare alone with a fork due to this. Even if the Tortilla Chips were on point, this is an odd marriage​ and the kitchen really ought to rethink this delivery system altogether. If you only get one thing at La Société Montréal, let it be their French Onion Soup which features the richest Broth in recent memory along with a simple setlist​: White Wine, a toasted piece of Bread, and molten Gruyère Cheese. I am sure some will scoff at the $15.00 price​ tag attached​ to this dish but trust - it is worth every penny if you are a lover of French Onion Soup. The sauteed Onions, The nutty scent of Gruyère, the crispy yet softness of the Bread point... truly a sublime number and completely erased​ the stale Tortilla Chips from my memory. I am sure the IPA helped with that as well...There is room for improvement​ at La Société Montréal but overall, I really enjoyed my visit and would eagerly return for another crock's worth of that wonderful French Onion Soup."
/user_details?userid=7J6sOvhSksLtzO9hFPEnGQ,Phil C.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Got into town on a rainy Friday evening and found this spot near my hotel. The place had a nice old-school vibe to it, with of course hockey on the television (Memorial Cup, I believe).I wanted something lighter so I opted for a French onion soup. It isn't one of those with Gruyere cheese all over the rim of the bowl, and it looked classy. The taste matched the presentation with a nice broth that was balanced. The cheese and bread was enough to satisfy.The croque madame wasn't the nicest-looking I've seen, but it tasted quite good. The egg was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of cheese to go with toasted bread and ham. The dressed greens rounded out a nice meal.Service was fine and the atmosphere was intimate. I could go here again for late eats or brunch."

The burger was great, I'm not sure what mine was called, but basically a ham sandwich on white bread with melted cheese on top. It has a fancy name, but think souped up Honda Civic. Any way you look at it, it's still a Civic. Don't order the fries unless you like them soft and soggy. Having said that, the French Onion soup was really good, the drink (moulin rouge) was dangerously good. And the service was great. We had Dianny and she was excellent. Based on the reviews I'm thinking we may have just ordered the wrong thing."

Note that I've been to the Toronto restaurant and it was pretty good so I've had good expectations for the Montreal location.It was around 4pm when I entered the restaurant and it wasn't busy as there were two tables and four people at the bar. But even though there weren't a lot of people, the service was really slow....So I ordered the French onion soup and it was mediocre. Flavour wasn't enough, it could have be better. And I also got the croque madame I think? It was just too much oil for my liking. The atmosphere was pretty nice though."

/user_details?userid=1K4PSYWAAxewU2JXROXN8Q,Mark C.,"Northbrook, IL",4 star rating,"We stayed at the hotel and we decided to try the restaurant.  Usually, we try to avoid hotel restaurant as they are generally not good and tend to be over priced.  However, La Societe was an exception.  We really liked the decor as it had a true Paris bistro feel.  The waiter recommended a fine bottle of white wine - Macon Chaintre Les Pierres Polies - (we are now trying to find at Binny's!) and we started with Tartare Saumon.  (That's Salmon Tartar for you people who speak United States!)  It was absolutely fabulous!  We have had this so many times back home and it is usually pretty bland.  Here they perfected it with the perfect amount of flavors.  It went perfect with the wine.  For the entrees, my lovely wife got the Cod as that was the fish special and I decided to get the Bavette De Boeuf Marinee.  It was out of this world and I finished every bite.  I would describe it as a marinade maison, sauce vin rouge ou beurre maître d'hôtel,à côté au choix, frites maison.  What?  You did not comprendre?  Ahh, well, it was a marinated flank steak with a red wine reduction sauce (get that instead of the butter sauce) with a side of french fries.  Tres Bon!  We recommend this restaurant highly if you are in Montreal.  By the way, they have a happy hour with oysters for $1.50.  We missed that but perhaps next time!"

But it was the Grand Prix weekend and we know how busy downtown gets! The experience completely turned around once we sat down and enjoyed the excellent service and food of the restaurant. From the quality of the cocktails, to the attention to details of our orders, to the quality of the food (rabbit, bouillabaisse, oysters and steak tartare), we were very pleased. We enjoyed a bottle of Sancerre and a bottle of Montepulciano, which were also very good. Crème brûlée to finish it all off ... we were happy campers. I would recommend the restaurant, especially on a quieter night!"

We waited almost 45 minutes to have OUR ORDER TAKEN?? This meal lasted like 3.5 hours which is absurd considering the restaurant was virtually empty. It didn't help that our waiter kept trying to make jokes about it, playing it off like ""oh don't worry it'll be worth it."" That doesn't help when I'm S T A R V I N G !! Didn't really enjoy the lamb tagine. I thought it was on the bland side and def needed the spiced amped up threefold. Breakfast was another story. The service was quick and my french toast donut was tasty and evenly balanced, with a great maple syrup flavor (although I was unclear about what the ""donut"" component was supposed to be...)"

I didn't know what to expect from this restaurant, so I went for brunch on a weekday. I got the squash soup which is delicious and the croque monsieur was okay. The service was fantastic except the incident the waitress thought my card was AMEX and when she realizes it was not, she removed the free champagnes menu from my table. Needless to mention, it was awkward after. I wouldn't mind going back since they are very attentive in your needs."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for MTL à table and tried to take different things on the menu with friends. As a presentation, every dish is nicely plated and decorated. The fish soup was good and the fish itself was very tender. It tasted a bit too fishy for me. The oyster was filled with spinach, hollandaise sauce and topped with some salad. It was also pretty good. As for the main course, the sauted seafood was fresh and nicely seasoned without overpowering the ingredient's natural taste. The scallop that came with it was pretty big. As for the desserts however, the nougat was a bit too sweet for us and we couldn't finish it. The donut was good but tasted a bit plain. The service is quick and the staff is friendly. They came mang times to fill our water without being too excessive and asked us a few times throughout the evening if everything was ok. The place itself is clean. It's kinda dark in the restaurant but every table has it's own candle lamp so it's perfect for talking with friends. Overall, the experience was enjoyable. However, it didn't leave an impression strong enough for me to go back."

The service was ssssllllooooww. It took our friendly waitress quite some time to get our drink order in and then follow up with our meal order. Another downer, they were out of oysters by the time we arrived at 7:45. The meals: - French onion soup: disappointing, lacked flavor (and sherry)- Yellowfin tuna tartar: bland, but nice presentation- Caesar salad with salmon: plentiful and good, but not remarkable- Salad verte: decent and pretty good - not exciting"

We ordered 2 dozen oysters,  lobster ravioli,  octopus and seared tuna. The oysters and octopus were both very good! The Lobster ravioli was a little salty to me, and we did not like the tuna tartare at all.  They had put dill in the tuna tartare,  and unfortunately,  the dill completely overpowered the natural taste of the tuna. However,  the seared tuna was my favorite  dish,  as it was perfectly cooked and seasoned! Overall,  we had a good experience and we actually did come back again for coffe/drinks, due to it's location and convenience."

Everyone always raves about how amazing the food is in Montreal, this restaurant was a bit less than I expected. Fries were good. I didn't understand the Caesar salad.

/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Very happy to find this little gem.French onion soup was good, though not the best I've had.  It's definitely better than 95%+ of what I had the misfortune to try in NYC. I felt compelled to rate the place pretty high just on this soup alone, not because it was earth-shatteringly great but just because I've been struggling to find good French onion soup.He small seafood platter was very good.  Oysters were shucked and cleaned properly, without the sand that is often left over at oysters up and down the east coast. Shrimps were cleaned and deveined.  Mariana sauce was meh but I like the shrimps dipped in the dressing in the lobster salad.The lobster salad was distinctly unFrench with its heavy use of cilantro but it worked pretty well with the dressing.  I recommend the small platter for sure.Beef carpaccio was very fresh and very delicious.  I think there was maybe a tablespoon or half tablespoon too much oil but it was well within personal preference range and my wife really liked it. Duck confit was very nicely done.  The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was still tender.  The roasted veggies below the duck tasted good, albeit ordinary.I'd have taken a little more time to torch the edges of the creme brûlée but the middle was already a little too burnt so I guess whoever did it just needed to be a little more careful.  It was still a pretty good effort and the custard had just the right consistency and amount of sweetness.Overall an excellent dining experience for this price point."

Stayed downtown Montreal for only one night and wanted to find some decent food in the area. The hotel down the street recommended this little restaurant. I didn't know what to expect since it was at another hotel so thinking it would be small portions and super expensive. To my surprised I got the lamb and it was reasonable at around $27. The food was excellent, the lamb was super tender, the rice was nicely flavoured. The fries which I had to pay extra came in a decent portion and it looks like it was lightly seasoned with cinnamon. I would recommend coming back again."

Normally hotel restaurants are hit or miss (usually a miss), but Le Societe is far from that category and provides a great dining experience from the food to the service.There is a bar section that houses a few tables on the side, then there is the actually dining room that has an open set up with booth type seating. I took to the dining room and got an order of Moules Frites (mussels and fries) for lunch. The dish was excellent. The fries were pretty standard, but the broth the mussels were coated in was delicious. It was my first time having this combination and I must say they did a hell of a job. The service was very professional, which matches the overall caliber of the hotel. Having a place like this on site makes staying at the Loews hotel a must. Makes for a great combination."

It has a very 20s style vibe inside.We sat at the bar and ordered champagne (Moet Chandon) to start. Adorned with a small strawberry, the champagne was quite tasty. Next, I chose the Rosemopolitan, which is a cosmo with rosewater. YUM! I love anything rose flavored so this was such a delight. It had a nice rose scent and didn't taste very cosmo-ey. My friend had a midori sour, but the bartender never made one before so it didn't come out as expected. But the drink was still a good one, whatever it was :)We also enjoyed the barbeque potato chips (house made) that were gratis at the bar. A little salty for my taste, but a nice departure from nuts. All told we spent a pretty penny on the drinks. But the cosmo was well worth it."

We chose La Société after looking up many well-rated French restaurants in the downtown Montreal area, so we were looking foward to the nice decor, and supposedly amazing French food.Unfortunately, the food AND the service was bad. My duck confit was terribly dry. I loved the the Leek and Vinaigrette appetizer, which was the only redeeming part of the evening. My friend's hanger steak and frites supposedly was alright, however it needed more salt, as opposed to my duck which was too salty. What really gave this restaurant one star was the service. We waited and waited for our waiter to come and ask us for our orders and also for any sort of refill on water or drinks, even though the restaurant only had two other parties present. My friend was charged refills on her soft drink and when asked about it, our waiter mentioned that ""Mcdonald's might do free refills, but nice restaurants DO NOT."" Whether that is true or not, I would say it's very out of turn for a waiter to mention that. Plus, I have never experienced a nice French restaurant that charges refills on a Coke of all things.

The waiter who took our command forgot our toasts, but we also forgot, so nevermind. The food was good, I liked the potatoes, they're a little crunchy. My breakfast sandwich was, in fact, an English muffin like the ones served at McDonald's, although much better.To sum up, we paid $60 including tips and taxes, it's ok for 3 people, I would come back!"

We ordered 2 cocktails each and a bottle of wine to share. We also shared the oysters, large charcuterie platter and large cheese platter. I sent back 2 oysters out of the dozen on my plate because they were bad. There was no attempt at an apology. I asked the waiter a second time if he told the kitchen (so they don't poison anyone) he said very casually that he had mentioned it. There was no apology or offer to replace them. The charcuterie platter arrives with a smoked duck breast that no one could chew through, duck terrine, some brown proscuitto and a spicy calabrese cold cut. The brown proscuitto tasted like mould. We didn't know it was prosciutto until they said it was ""prosciutto di parma"" and then realized we had a big problem. They served us food that was bad - and we had eaten it. Prosciutto should be pink, not 3 shades of brown. The cheese board is not worth the price. 3 kinds of cheap cheeses that you can buy at any grocery store. Before we left, we spoke to the manager who was so rude and so unapologetic it was offensive. One of us was sick in the restaurant before even leaving. She didn't make it home and had to stop several times on the way to be sick. This is completely unacceptable. This place has no respect for the health of their customers or the  food service industry. They removed the cost of the charcuterie platter but our bills were still $60+ each. Manager is so rude. Service is slow. We basically paid almost a hundred bucks to be poisoned. Never again. Diners beware."
/user_details?userid=TXtUyyYXwNha0M6Vl71bEA,JD S.,"Marlton, NJ",2 star rating,Restaurant is ok if you are need of a meal on a cold Montreal night. Menu is limited. I will give them props for an excellent garden salad and onion soup. The garden salad has an excellent dressing and it is not drowning in it. The onion soup is very good as well. Unfortunately these are the highlights of a limited and expensive menu. I also have a major gripe about the pours on the glasses of wine. They are possibly the worst ones I have ever seen. They get at least 8 glasses to the bottle. I am used to short pours but this is ridiculous! If you are staying at the hotel and it's 20 below then eat here. Otherwise take a short walk to Crescent street and enjoy better menus and most importantly pours!

Easily made a reservation via email, and was really excited to come. We arrived around 6, a little earlier than our reservation and the place was EMPTY. We wanted to leave but there was no going back as we were ushered to our seats. We were nervous to say the least. Why was it empty?!Cool atmosphere. The waitress initially seemed like a stuck up snob, but by the end of the night (2 hours) she was actually pretty awesome. Fast, nice, eventually willing to communicate in English with us (I know, it's your country and you speak French there. Awesome, but help a girl out. My French only goes so far). It's hard to talk about the food. We've never had this type of cuisine before, and I think we just didn't appreciate it. It wasn't great and I left hungry and disappointed. Again, I think it's because I've never had bone marrow, fore gras....If this was a type of food I liked, maybe I'd have been more impressed. The drinks were tasty and awesome. I liked the Kungfu Girl Reisling, but was rather bummed that I learned how cheap it is outside in the real world- I definitely got ripped off at La Societe. The dessert was AMAZING."

The bar on the other side seemed to have more of a buzz.The Habs had a home game so maybe that had something to do with it? Still, it had a relaxed and warm atmosphere. We ordered the beef tartare as an app. We had it spicy. 80g portion was good for sharing. If you've never had tartare and want to try it for the first time this would be a good choice. It had more stuff (parsley, onion, lemon) than other Tartares I've had and didn't look/taste as 'raw' - it was tasty- would get again. We also had the duck confit. Portion size was adequate as an entree. I thought it looked and tasted a bit dry but D said he was happy with it. I ordered the scallops and pork belly. When the server brought it out, I was shocked at how small the portion was. Ummm,  $32. For 2 scallops resting on 2 small pieces of pork belly???? Anywhoo, I ate it veeery slowly and I have to say all of the flavours were amazing! The sweet, salty, smoky and the crunchy and smooth textures of all the ingerients were a true delight. One more scallop and pork belly on the plate would have been perfect for the price point (I'm not a pig, but I'm no bird either and I don't care much for dessert). If u do order dessert you'll probably be full. Service was okay, food came out in a timely manner. No one really checked on us, so I wasn't really feelin' the love, but no biggie."

Other items on the table were a steak frites and a beef bourguignon that was rich and hearty, though very salty. Another great item was the duck confit. They know how to do duck in Montreal, and this was no exception. It was cooked perfectly-- moist and tender on the inside, with the skin perfectly crisped. The decor was very classy, and the quiet jazz playing in the background only added to the ambience created by mahogany furniture and copper ceilings. Our waiter was very friendly. The restaurant was pretty empty as we visited on a weeknight, so he hung out to chat with us for a bit. He told us a lot about Montreal and recommended a great wine.

Was not told refills were not free, and I find it very unusual to have to pay for refills unless explicitly told (soda prices are not even listed on menu). When I asked the waiter about it he was VERY rude--said refills might be free somewhere like McDonalds, but they are not so at nice restaurants.

Give it a try."
