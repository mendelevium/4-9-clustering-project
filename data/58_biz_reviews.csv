Le Réservoir had many original beer to choose from, my friend ordered a grapefruit beer and I chose a rhubarb beer which was juicy and refreshing. For food I ordered a tuna tataki sandwich with chorizo and spicy mayo ($17) which was delicious and filling. They sell bottles of beer to take home and merch such as pint glasses, hats, totes and shirts. Service was great, place was trendy and nice. 10/10 would go again and would recommend to a friend!"

And boy were we pleased by our decision to try this spot!!!What we ate: we shared almonds & pistachios; carrots , hummus w mint;olives; grilled cheese; jalapeños poppers, and; pickled herrings All were delicious! Simple & tasty & fresh. What we drank: I had a negroni and a chardonnay. Hubs had 2 Beaujolais' -- my cocktail was great & the wines good. Overall a decent experience!!Total cost:$110 + tipCompared to the $650 we spent at La Mousso this was a trip!! And funnily we preferred this meal!! Lesson learned: simple honest fare served in a genuine and relaxed Plateau  vibe can't be beat!!!"

The atmosphere was cozy and quaint, and they let us hang out for quite awhile while drinking only a few glasses of wine and beer. They had an excellent selection of beer and wine, and I really like the area and the feeling of our fellow diners. I'd definitely come back on a cold, wintry day to warm up with some tasty glasses of something!"
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",4 star rating,"Great ideas and great flavors!  Loved the sweetbreads and mushroom special!   Really enjoyed the smoked herring  Great service.  Just a fun energy and great food. A must do sort of place. Great selection of beers.  The only place we went to twice during our recent trip to Montreal.  Did find out that the specials are Brunch/lunch, so when we went for dinner our last night in town we had to make due with the excellent normal menu!  :)  Roof top is very cool, but can be tricky to get a seat up there."
/user_details?userid=bqiKM5CN5HZRJJoOSXIFHA,Alex W.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Perfect date spot in the heart of the Saint Laurent strip, micro brewery meets gastro pub with an elevated lunch & dinner menu carefully curated. Not a very huge amount of options but something for everyone, seafood leaning menu, I recommend the Lobster Bisque & their grilled cheese with caramelized onions was really great as well. While you're here do yourself a favour & try at least a few of the specialty beer's available, if you're into the brewery culture you won't be disappointed here."

Let me tell you, those people were not wrong. They have awesome and one of a kind beer. My friends and I loved them. We tried 3 different kinds and shared them. Loved them all, the service is good and the vibe of the bar is good. The location is convenient and well overall: loved it!"
/user_details?userid=jKn_HycMvKa3yPHAUoCQAQ,Angela C.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,"Stumble upon this place on a solid night venturing around Montreal. Take the upstairs patio!!! You can see the stars at night while sipping on good beer and enjoy the summer breeze. Very warm and lively ambiance. Servers were still figuring out some kinks,as  they kept delivering food to our table even though we didn't order it. Service  was also slower then usual as we had to order drinks at the bar ourselves. We also tried fiddlehead ferns - has a long bean look but taste like asparagus. The breadcrumbs and the grated Parmesan was a tasteful combination. The dressing was very vinegrettey. I think it wouldve been better if they were less generous with it or drizzled it on the side instead (personal preference).Great place for a group to chill/catch up with!"
/user_details?userid=tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,Jay M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is pretty cool. Admittedly we came here twice, once for drinks when it was only a brunch menu but we weren't feeling up for brunch... The other time we came for dinner and actually ate.First things first, the beers here are pretty darn good!I really enjoyed the Sour IPA, although was less stoked on the grapefruit IPA. My girlfriend loved the Rhubarb Kolsch as the rhubarb has a slightly sour quality which balanced flavourfully with the smooth drinking beer.  The Cream Ale also had some smooth, non-offensive drinkability worth shouting out for those who like the more basic flavours.When we did return for dinner the other time, we had a couple of the Fried Chicken Sandwiches and 1 order of the eggplant, which is literally a halved eggplant thats been roasted with some garlic milk and basil. The food was pretty good, although neither items really floored us. That said, the place seems like a pretty cool place to stop for drinks and it seemed like there was a patio upstairs as well. Overall, a high quality destination for the craft beer enthusiasts like myself should you end up in the Plateau."
/user_details?userid=4rCxhWOWHF05dwhYIL9SYw,El D.,"Albuquerque, NM",5 star rating,Microbreweries are synonymous with wineries with regards to quality and this place stays on par with those expectations. I got lucky to get a table in their balcony this past summer. My favorite beer was the dry stout. This place has high quality beer and is located right in the Plateau which is another plus. Didn't get a chance to try any of their apps therefore will reserve reviewing those.
/user_details?userid=De3Yl24A7MUZvK40rP6RLg,Annie K.,"Medford, MA",5 star rating,"Stopped by with a few friends for brunch, and I could not have been happier we came to Le Reservoir!This place is definitely trendy for brunch - so make sure you get here early if you want to sit right away. We arrived sometime around 11-11:30 with a party of 8 and were able to sit down right away - but by noon parties of 2-10 were left to wait or were turned away. There was quite a crowd by the time we wrapped up!This place is a bar by night - so there's a pleasant beer selection for brunch if that's what you're into. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is the Beer Mimosa, which comes made with a hefewiezen, orange and grapefruit. Trust me I was hesitant when I heard ""beer mimosa"" but after trying a friend's I instantly ordered my own. They also brew a great cup of coffee here (actual drip coffee - not an Americano which you'll sometimes get in other places).The menu is small, but the items on the menu pack a punch. I started with the strawberry toast. The toast was a crispy, thick cut slice of crusty white bread, with a thick spread of strawberry preserved, topped with a dollop of creme fraiche and thyme. The toast is definitely sweet, as they really pack on the strawberry jam - but when you swirl in the creme fraiche it really calms the flavor down. For my main dish, I had the sunny side up eggs - which also came with a piece of crusty white bread toast but had a blueberry pickled yellow bean salad on the side. The berries and bean salad was a pleasant surprise - I was wary of the combination, but couldn't help but clean my plate of them all. The place was incredibly delicious and balanced - and the ""bang for your buck"" item on the menu. Other friends I was with ordered the tuna sandwich and the guinea hen which seemed to be smaller fare.The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating, and did a great job of balancing all the tables and demands. Our waitress in particular was super charming, and knew the beers really well (do yourself a favor and ask the staff to recommend you a beer - they're also happy to give you a taste of anything that piques your interest). Also of note - we did not have any french speakers in our party, and that was not a problem as the staff comfortably spoke to us in English and made us feel right at home.I would come back to this place, and would like to see what it's like at night. The upstairs seems tempting..."
/user_details?userid=VWECnpBZkQtBJThq0Bmyew,Leema J.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,"This place was recommended as a favorite bar of Montreal by a local, and I couldn't agree more! I came here for a late night drink with friends, and was so happy that I tried it out. A laid-back atmosphere with an incredibly friendly staff. The microbrews are to die for, the Weizen (that may be incorrect in spelling) being my favorite. It's a lighter beer with a very unique taste. The Cream Ale was also a favorite in the group. I personally didn't order any food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious. To Non-French speakers-- beware that the menus are only in French. Not a huge deal, as at least one of the bartenders will help you out in English. Be sure to check out the upstairs-- the space was incredible with mood lighting and group tables to facilitate the laid back mood. The brick interior housed French doors that opened up to an outdoor patio with seating. I wish I had come in the summertime, as that would have been quite the treat. Overall, if you're looking for a relaxing place to catch up with friends, Réservoir is the place to be!"
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here after a nice Yelp event for the after-event drinks. This is a cool pub, they have a very cool balcony upstairs BUT its not very huge so if you are more then 4-5 people its hard to find a spot (better for 2-3 people). I found the music levels a little too loud (again if you get the balcony its a different story) and the service a little slow (they were packed). The beers are very good, especially since its a micro brewery. I am a big fan of porters (which they dont have) but the triple was very good. Overall experience was great due to the company and the beer. I would consider revisiting this place if I can get the balcony sits"
/user_details?userid=r5fUZn7T45Pu5cmNBQDVdw,Ryan B.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"A lot of people have already written about this place's music, brunch, and bar. Though I don't think anyone has mentioned that you have the option to get coffee drinks served ""in a bowl."" They essentially bring out an oversized cereal bowl full of your desired beverage! Great for those who like to work to down-tempo techno and sip the afternoon away."
/user_details?userid=ZxzS4Tzx-HDFdZ-ADCo3yA,Abby O.,"Sacramento, CA",5 star rating,"I stumbled upon this brewery and restaurant while in vacation in Montreal.  I was alone, and it was a great place to eat alone, enjoy the offerings, and watch people go by.  It's on a charming pedestrian walkway, with tables right by the windows that open up onto the walkway. Beer was delicious and interesting, food was not cheap but it was the best fried chicken sandwich I'd ever had. The dessert was unnecessarily large and delicious. Service was friendly, a little slow, but that is how you should eat in a restaurant like that. I didn't make it to the upstairs area, but it looked nice."
/user_details?userid=drS7OQ2AVHZHFoxBrxV6-Q,Joey M.,"Somerville, MA",4 star rating,"The beers at this place are solid. Better than your typical microbrew/brasserie. We tried the Cream Ale, the Citra Pale and the Berlinner Weisse with sour cherries. All of them were good. I'm not crazy about the cream ale, but our waiter/bartender did warn us it was a pretty mild flavored beer, so I can't blame em there. We also got the tacos and the churros and WOW. I don't think I've had tacos that good on the east coast before. Very surprised at how good they were. The churros were decadent too. Covered in sugar, moist yet crunchy and still hot from the fryer, really solid caramel (homeade?) sauce and whipped cream. Not cheap but so, so good. Overall this is a solid solid place and I highly recommend stopping in"

On a Monday night, this place was quiet.Bartender was nice and helpful in helping us to pick our beers but since Reservoir has a limited choices on draft: Black, White, Scotch Ale, Plisner, Weizen, Cherry and IPA.We didn't order any snack or food because it was almost midnight... and all we need was a drink.Beers were OK. I guess...Nothing standout to be too awesome for a special trip, but definitely will drop by for a pint or 2 when I am in the area!"
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Reservoir is the kind of place where, whether you're going for a meal or just want to enjoy a drink with friends, you can be surrounded by people, yet still have an intimate conversation. The food and drink options are fantastic, but more than anything, the atmosphere is what makes it. Right at the corner of Duluth and St Laurent, it's a breath of fresh air in a crowded part of the city."
/user_details?userid=8Ni1MmORWyvW0lJHJiqiQg,Arvid Y.,"Rochester, NY",4 star rating,"I stumbled across Reservoir over the weekend while attending a bachelor party in Montreal. On their website, it is described as a ""Brasserie artisanale.""My translation for that would be ""tapas beer bar."" The atmosphere is trendy and hipster, with plenty of tattooed waitstaff. They have a rooftop terrace, which we took full advantage of.They offer a good selection (~7) of their own microbrews, covering most beer categories. I opted for the Saison which was crisp, clean and nicely carbonated. They also have a few different wine selections. Unfortunately, we did not sample any food. However, the items coming out of the kitchen looked amazing, especially the tacos.The service was great and the bartenders were all friendly. Maybe it's a Canadian thing? Anyways, Reservoir is a great venue to enjoy food and drinks with friends. The outdoor rooftop seating is an added bonus."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So, it seems, Reservoir has gone vegetarian.Beer and a veggie-burger, guys? Oh yay! :-/They do have squid rings, true, but that's not really enough to satisfy your average meat loving person for longer than it takes to quaff one of their micro-brewed beers.That's as long as we stayed there - one beer- so there's not much more to report except for the almost eerie lack of men in the place."

They always have a few good brews on tap and the terrace upstairs is amazing. They also feature a few tasty and inexpensive light eats and sandwiches / burgers.  I really like their grilled cheese and the Halumi sandwiches. On my last visit I had an American Pilsner that is just right for summer. Their American IPA is nice and hoppy! Service is the non-pushy kind (AKA you will be left alone after being served), and it's just better to go pay at the counter."
/user_details?userid=eoFf37ltiVDFSanmgtFsbQ,Kelly W.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"We stopped at Le Réservoir for beers and a light snack after a walking tour in Montréal.  It's in a really cute part of town, and was a hot day so the front doors were all open to the outside which creates a nice atmosphere. The bar set up is cool, and you can see some of the micro-brewing in the back.  I think there is seating on the upper deck, but it was midday on a week day/ relatively slow and as aforementioned - really hot out so no one was seated up there.  The service was great and the beer was good! It's definitely the American in me, but (especially on a sweltering hot day) I prefer an ice cold beer vs a room temperature one, however the flavor was really great - I like sour beers and IPAs so the sour IPA was right up my alley (more sour and less hoppy than I would expect from an IPA, but delicious). I had their version of broccoli raab with chili, lime and parmesan - it was great, definitely had a bit of a kick to it (which i love). I would recommend Le Réservoir for anyone looking for a small bite and a good local brew."

Luckily, we spotted the roof patio at Reservoir, and the decision was made. We tried two beers, the IPA Citra and the Blanche, both were phenomenal. After watching the waitress carry them past, we also decided to give the petits beignets a go, and they were crispy and delicious, just like we'd hoped.The service was friendly and comfortable, just like the atmosphere. Love the rooftop patio (though there aren't a ton of seats that are actually outside). I bet they wait all winter to throw those glass doors open."

Reservoir is english-friendly and a good spot to get some novel, healthy eats with  notable vegetarian tacos. Beer selection is excellent with a few nitro brews on hand. Strangely enough they do offer bombers, though you're not allowed to take them out of the pub. Shame, I guess you'll have to drink them immediately. Which is no problem whatsoever given that their bottled beers are often experimental or unique. Good pricing and ambiance."

I wasn't expecting vegetarian but the bartender mentioned it and I was like what the heck. The menu is so diverse and full of choices that I forgot it was vegetarian. I had a duo of soft tacos that contained a variety of ingredients that made me feel like I was at a Mexican taco stand. Paired with the West Coast IPA I found myself in food heaven. The atmosphere here is great too. Dark and mysterious with a great selection of music playing. Make sure you check out the giant beer tanks too. I love this place and would definitely go back again and again."

They mostly make classics (IPA, cream ale, pilsner, stout...) with a few wildcards here and there (Black cherry Berliner Weisse).They only make vegetarian food and they know what they're doing! I'm one of those buzzkills who'll trash-talk anything vegetarian that's trying to imitate meat, but the veggie burger is amazeballs and almost doesn't make you wish for real meat!The tacos and vegetarian chili are also really good.The staff is cool and friendly.Definitely one to check out."

Cocktails.What I assumed: upper scale bar snacks like olives and almonds.What I guessed: dinner menu, on the chalkboard.What surprised me: the second floor terrasse. Late night noshing meant that some of the main entrees were fini. But the fish and chips were calling my hangry tummy. Arriving 10 or so minutes later, presented on a wooden board with a spread of tarter sauce, mayo and ketchup -- I shut up and stuffed my face full. A lively feel upstairs, we were surrounded by folks doing Irish Car Bombs (although, this is not that kind of place), mixed with giggles and laughter brought on by a mixed crowd. Hipster aloof is what I was expecting from the service, but what we found was friendly guys who were on the ball and whipping up some pretty stellar drinks. Would I go back for beers and brunch? Uh, is my name Crystal H?"

Maybe it's because this time I sat up at the bar so I was definitely attended to much faster and had direct access to anything I needed from the servers. I ordered my usual pint of Weizen beer (although I wish I tried their cherry beer, instead) as well as a gruyere grilled cheese sandwich that, unlike last time, included a thick slab of bacon too. As usual, I'm very pleased with this place. I look forward to pushing my boundaries on my next visit and trying new food/drinks that they have to offer, which I don't doubt will be anything short of perfect and satisfying."

They have about six beers on tap at the same time. All are crafted on place, and vary from night to night. I personally enjoyed the Cherry Porter, and their IPA. I found their food to be average, especially for the price. Everything is vegetarian, but the choices are varied. Finally, our service was decent. The clientele, and overall atmosphere is pretty hipster, so keep that in mind if it's not something you like. Will definitely go back!"

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"I have ignored Reservoir for years. Not sure why, may be just have forgotten about its existance, because there are so many other brew pubs in town. A week ago I walked by and I saw the cherry white on the beer list, and I knew I must return soon. Oh, cherry beer, cherry beer! The cherry brew is rather red then white, has a mild sweetness and it is very easy to drink, although somehow dangerous with its 5.7% for somebody who just came back from business trip and is a little bit exhausted. The Reservoir list of brews is relatively small, but there is something for everybody. My date appreciated the Citra IPA. The food options are affordable and some of the simple choices are perfect match for the beers. The hummus with naan bread and the delicious french fries could be the favourite snack for everybody.  As every respectable brew pub in Montreal Le reservoir is relatively small, sweetly crowded and sometimes overwhelmingly noisy.

I've recently popped in a few times and have wondered why I waited so long. This is micro-brew pub done right. A relaxed vibe. Decent music. And most important of all: good beer! Nothing too ""out there"", just solid beers. I'm partial to the pilsner and the saison été myself, but drinking companions have commented on the quality of the blanche and the cream ale as well. Something else Reservoir does well is their food. A step above the standards nuts or olives (though they have them as well), they have goodies like homemade chips and calamari.

/user_details?userid=i0gnj7kVZkP9szX0EIAByA,Matthew C.,"RINGOES, NJ",2 star rating,"I was surprised at how poor this place was given its Yelp rating at the time of our visit.We came here around 4pm the first time, excited for a little dinner-time munch and some good beer. We were informed by the kind waitress that we were too early for the kitchen. Okay - whatcha got? Drinks, nuts, and olives to hold you off. Great, we'll take a drink and some olives.I had a disappointing cream ale. The girlfriend tried their take on a szarlotka. I'm Polish-American, and my first proper drink was a szarlotka in Poland with Żubrówka and fresh apple juice. They were using decent bison grass vodka, because this szarlotka was well-balanced and tasty for a surprise appearance in a Montréal brewpub.We told the waitress that we would go to the thrift store on the corner to pass the remaining 45 minutes or so. After leaving my debit card with her, we set off. When we came back, our street-view table next to the window had been given to another couple. I was a touch upset that our items had been moved.Girlfriend gestured that since I was irritated, we should just leave. It didn't help that when the bill came, the small (ketchup-container-sized) dish of past-prime olives (see other reviews - our visit confirmed that their olives are indeed _not_ fresh) had cost us five dollars. I had been put off enough by the fact that the olives served to keep our taste buds busy were frankly unappetizing. But to charge five bucks for them takes some gall!Lastly - and the main reason for two, rather than three, stars - this place is a brewpub, and their beer simply isn't very good. We returned (myself, a bit sourly) to the restaurant to meet some friends. It was around seven p.m. on a Thursday and all they had to eat was fish and chips and a sandwich or two. Okay, fine, beer for me. All I could drink was the stout, which was bitterly unbalanced, lacking in body and mouthfeel, and generally of poor flavor. The environment was loud and uncomfortable, spatially poorly-arranged, and insufficiently lit (even for a dim night-time bar experience, the lighting was poorly executed).I don't mean to be overly critical of this place. Really. As a general principal, when I find things to dislike, I search harder for the merit in those things. Réservoir left me amiss as to the reason for their reputation. I _love_ beer. It's my first love before scotch, wine, brandy and cigars. If you're looking for a spot for good food and great beer - avoid this place, do yourself a favor, and visit the nearby (~10 blocks or so) Dieu du Ciel. They live up to their high ratings in every capacity."

We visited Reservoir twice during our week in Montreal, once around 10pm and the place was buzzing, the second time this afternoon at around 4pm and again it was a fun and lively atmosphere. Great selection of music too and it's played loud enough to enjoy but not blasted so loud that you can't even have a conversation. On our second visit we ordered food and it was really tasty - very savoury and filling. Another plus point.What's more, coming from Vancouver with its relentless and frustrating obsession for filling each wall of a bar with multiple widescreen TVs, Reservoir - and indeed most bars in Montreal - are a welcome and refreshing change!Highly recommend and, if we were staying longer, we'd definitely go back again!"

Music was chill, servers were chill, and the atmosphere too. Crowd was cool. I expected pretentious hipsters, but really everyone was just hip. Reviewers suggested going to the 2nd floor to sit, but realized there would be a difference in the winter. I just got back from our trip, March, but it was snowing a bit. So the upstairs ended up being just more seating space rather than an open terrace.. a bit lounge-like, but definitely much less pub-like and loud than downstairs. It closed earlier though, maybe 11pm-12am ish.  Our server was sweet, friendly, and very helpful. She offered to translate everything and was very attentive, her timing was perfect in bringing over our second round of drinks. My boyfriend and I both got the cream ale. I just checked the menu online and can't find it, but if you happen to see it when you're there, get it!!! So, so good. He can't stop talking about it. I'm less of a beer aficionado and I can't stop either! So CREAMY and rich and smooth. Definitely coming back, even just for that beer.We ordered from the written menu, and our friends ordered from the specials on the board, some fish dish that I didn't try, but looked delicious. We got the grilled cheese, fish and chips, and arugula salad. Overall a great combo! The grilled cheese was quite small for the price, in my opinion, with 1.50 for extra bacon, which we got of course. But it was just too good to complain. Pickles were eh, though. Fish and chips were very yummy, nothing crazy to rave about there, but the arugula salad was especially nice. Extremely light yet flavorful. And definitely necessary with all the greasy stuff we were eating hahaComing back without question."

I spotted a couple tables filled with people on the first floor (which has more of a bar/pub feel to it), before heading up to the second floor. The second floor has a lounge feel to it, with low tables and seating in the dimly lit room. It's open air on two sides to the terrace, which had about 10 tables, one free when we arrived. We snagged the free table (on the side, not overlooking the street, although it was a quiet street, so I don't know how much of a view there would have been).Our server came out right away and took our drink order. He was very friendly. When we arrived, there were menus on the table with the drinks list and the appetizers. When the server came back, he told us that the full menu was written above the bar in the inside room (annoying). So we had to get up from our table, stand awkwardly in the empty second-floor lounge area, and try to read the menu as quickly as possible (of course, it was in French, and not all French food ingredients are things you learn in college French). So, having attempted to quickly figure out which dishes sounded best, we slunk back to our table to pretend like we'd never had to get up in the first place.The end of all of that was that I ordered the Greek-style tacos from the dinner menu and my sister ordered the croque-monsieur from the appetizer menu.Our food came quickly enough, and was good. Like pub food, but with a French flair (and in my case, a Mexican/Greek/French flair?). The tacos were basically build your own style, with a chick pea filling, cucumber/tomato/vinagrette topping, and tzatziki sauce. Really interesting, and very good! My sister's croque-monsieur was good, with apple butter as an interesting twist.My beer was great - I went for the black beer for my first round and the pilsner for my second. The servers switched shifts, and a girl took over our table. She was friendly and attentive.We lingered on, staying until around midnight. Most of the diners on the terrace were there for the long run - casual conversations with friends, prolonged meals, several rounds of drinks. The terrace had a fantastic atmosphere on a warm summer night in Montreal. Being so far north, the sun stayed out for a long time and took forever to fully set. I'm sure this place is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, but for us, late on a summer Sunday, it was the perfect place to sit back, relax, and chat."

Tucked into the corner of Duluth, just off of St. Laurent is Reservoir, an excellent place with incredible beers.I'm a stout girl, there's no doubt about it and the Noire a L'avoine has everything I look for in an oatmeal stout: smooth, rich and creamy with a perfect bitterness factor. And great head; never underestimate the power of great head. The Cream Ale is a great choice for those of you looking for something light, smooth and easy drinking. If hops are more your thing, then the house India Pale Ale does not disappoint. The Scotch Ale is like caramel butter in your mouth: so, so good.They also have 750ml bottles and I highly recommend their Saison, a strong Belgian style that is perfect for any time of day, and any type of weather. With two floors, a sweet upper terrace, exposed brick and appropriate chalkboard décor, and not to mention its stellar location, this place would be worth checking out even if the beer was half as good.

We are tense people that like to have food shoveled into our faces quickly so we can get back to feeling important and busy. So I say thank goodness Reservoir is not located in Toronto.The food was perfectly prepared with maximum flavour and a killer presentation. I usually have eggs benny at new places as a gauge for how good they are. It's not a tough dish to make but it's still easy to screw up or cheap out on (packaged hollandaise or frozen asparagus/spinach for instance). I'm happy to say that it was delicious. Two eggs set on top of leeks with a little tea biscuit of some kind. The sauce was perfect and it came with a slab of bacon that melted in my mouth.The servers were sweet and attentive and helped make the restaurant feel comfortable and welcoming. There is no rushing here and no one telling you to finish up and make way for more customers. It was wonderful.I can't wait to come back and try out the micro brew.

The outdoor balcony/terrasse at the 2nd floor is obviously the place to be but large windows opening up to said patio (upstairs) and the street (downstairs) made it comfortable inside. Beer: Berliner Wiesse: Sour and refreshing. Blanche: So quaffable, i barely had time to get to know it. IPA: Hops in check and dripping with caramel, a nice surprise. Bottles: really interesting looking but I'm just not up for dropping almost $20 when the drafts are so well priced.Food: According to other reviews this place is known for brunch but for the evening I would definitely call Reservoir a bar with food rather than a gastropub or even a brewpub Sandwiches (especially the pork) and bar snacks are good but portions quite small, so really more for pacing yourself than actual meal-taking.Service: Friendly and relaxed. ""Relaxed"" is a euphemism for ""seemed to loose interest after our initial round,"" but it was early in the night and they were probably saving their energy. But the ""friendly"" part made this strangely not annoying. I didn't feel they were snubbing us and we got everything we asked for though it did mean having to walk a few steps to the bar a couple times. So, yeah, it was just one of those things that set the tone, but strangely not in a bad way.I love the fact that a place called ""reservoir"" has hit upon the brilliant strategy of serving lukewarm tap water when you ask for hydration. It's cheekily brilliant -- after all why would you want to give your patrons ice-cold, thirst-quenching water for free when you could sell them an  ice-cold, thirst-quenching pint?Also, for you other tourists, Duluth is a great street to walk down with lots of restos."

We were wrong, and the crowd in The Resevoir at noon when we arrived proved it. However, a table for two was not hard to come by and we waited a mere ten minutes - giving us plenty of time to debate our menu choices displayed on a big board behind the bar.It was a difficult decision. Health concerns pushed me towards a fruit salad that sounded scrumptious (nuts and prunes... how tasty!), yet, i gave in to a carb craving and ordered crepes with a pear compote, yogurt and maple syrup. Rather unfortunately, ten minutes after ordering, our waitress returned to ask me if pineapple compote would be okay because they had just run out of pear... le sigh. I love pineapple, but i am not a big citrus marmalade gal. My plate arrived: Three medium sized pancakes overlapping with a layer of jam and yogurt in between each and ample yogurt elsewhere on the plate. Carb heaven...Luckily, my companion did not give in to a carb temptation. He ordered duck - with bread and fried pancetta. I stole a bite and although i believe i like my duck a little more done, it was still very very tasty. An unfortunate oversight - no steak knives with the duck. However, the beverages - fresh orange-grapefruit juice and my earl grey tea which they steamed my milk for - were a pleasant addition. Did i mention the plentiful freshly-baked bread with butter (that should have been salted, but that's a true preference thing)?Resevoir needed to be visited. The ambiance is superb and the food worth the money (from $5 to $17 - my crepes were $10 and more than filling enough).

(My glass was still about a quarter full)A little while later, something magical happened.  The moment I finished my drink, the bartender brought both me and my partner in crime fresh new drinks.  We hadn't even seen him prepare them.  Then I realized that he had waited for me to finish that last drop so that he could bring them out.  As he handed them to us he said, ""The timing seemed about right.""  A tear gathered at the corner of my eye but I didn't dare betray my true feelings.  ""The timing was perfect,"" I replied.Anyway, while it might not seem like a big thing, this bartender was just great.  Very laid-back, clever, and an awesome bartender overall.  I can definitely appreciate that, and it's what first sold me on Reservoir.The layout is quite nice as well, and the bathroom is more than suitable for cleaning one's face after having been kicked by a stage diver.  It was just what I needed at the time, and I'm sure it will be what I need again."

/user_details?userid=uph2mQG4TnSicYIISZx3Nw,Neil G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great bar.  Some of the portions are too small, but the tartare is always a good size and delicious when they haven't run out.  Nice upstairs patio."
/user_details?userid=Z3SbFPFN9dUkXNr5xRy4gA,Jennifer M.,"Robbinsville, NJ",5 star rating,"I would come here all the time if I lived here. Excellent IPA, great food, accommodating bartenders. Mixed olives were a great variety and very generous. I got the grilled cheese which was crispy with extra sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. Tried my boyfriends fish and chips which was superb, and again, very generous. I would have gotten it if I thought I could handle it. Overall we both chose right and were glad we came to reservoir, which had been on our to-do list since day one."

They have a few beer options, and they are all great. Brewed there. The food is tasty, but you don't go here for dinner. Attentive staff and friendly vibe. Great place to sit, chat, drink and snack."

/user_details?userid=lu88gy8PbYPBaH1jgkmy4Q,Dan G.,"VA, VA",4 star rating,"Both times that we went here over the long weekend, the upstairs area was not open but they made up for it by having their Saison beer on draft which they generally only have in bottles.  The Saison beer was superbly light but a smooth slightly fruity after taste and it WAS 6.4% ABV!  It was a great summer beer.  The pale ale beer was also very good!  We also got appetizers one night.  We ended up getting the cheese plate and the scallop ceviche.  I enjoy all types of ceviche and this scallop ceviche was exellent and the portion was big.  You could have also gotten Quebec lobster as an add-on in the ceviche but we passed.   Our local Montreal friends had never seen ceviche on the menu.  Their menu was a chalk board which changed and was very limited.  IMO, a limited menu means that they do everything well rather than you trying to figure out what they do well out of dozens of selections.  This is a divey bar with great beer and a very casual meal if that is what you are looking for in a restaurant."

Not over dressed, but very simple. Staff was very helpful in describing all the beer they have and what they taste like."
/user_details?userid=5p7fIgmWgP6yWdqJbSrlig,Jasmine W.,"South Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"we went out with a group of 8ish on a friday evening and i expected a crowded spot full of rowdy 18 year olds (oh canada and your interesting drinking age!). however, reservoir was nothing like what i expected! we sat upstairs (there's also a cute outside balcony area), had no problems finding seating, and i liked that there was no pressure to order. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and forrest y really enjoyed their in-house brew. a few tempting munchies (grilled cheese sandwich - yumm!) and decent prices. wish that the bathrooms were cleaner and the music was weird (irregular electronic beats) but a good place for 20-30-somethings to enjoy a drink, catch up with friends, and relax."

/user_details?userid=V56AwFRZ7JErc_6dD5Wkbw,Al A.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,Good beers.  Great for brunch.  Lovely atmosphere in the summer.  Sometimes smells of the night before.  Somewhat slow table service even when the entire place is empty.
/user_details?userid=fhKFB2Zc4JF9XpGgDOQWgg,Robert G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5 star rating,"Sunday morning brunch recommended by our bartender the previous night, and boy did it hit the spot. Good espresso and fantastic food. I agree with others, the service wasn't amazing, but considering it was packed, and considering the quality of the food, I still give it 5 stars. The menu changes often, and theres a nice variety. Unbelievable short ribs were the highlight of the meal."
/user_details?userid=Udd0-eOIw27ee0gHc9XLBQ,Sarah H.,"Honolulu, HI",2 star rating,"The atmosphere was great but the service was not so great. The drink selection was great. The food selection and presentation was great but it was a little overpriced and extremely oily, I was sick the rest of the night after dinner. Cool place to hang with your bros but not so cool as a dining experience."
/user_details?userid=mHp2B0MPRThJ578M262Gjw,Candice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Perhaps it was because I came here on Friday in the middle of the afternoon, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was so-so.  My beer was decent but not that great.  The downstairs is a bit tiny for my liking.  The upstairs roof patio is nice, but smoke free.Still, everyone else here seems to like it, so I'm sure my review is a bit skewed."
/user_details?userid=-ayFHNE_tOErB8FR3ZOTjA,David T.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I heard about this place from a chef that I met while he was on vacation in Boston. His other restaurant, which is equally if not more impressive, is La Salle a Manger. He left Reservoir to open La Salle.Reservoir is amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed with a ""community"" feel to it. Coming from restaurants in Boston which are usually rushed it was nice to have a relaxing brunch that lasted about two hours. I know that long meals aren't for everyone but the staff was attentive without being encroaching. The menu: it is only in French but if you don't speak french just ask! I'm told that the menu switches pretty often, at least with each season.The food: everything we had was amazing but my two favorites were the Pork Belly with corn/tomato salsa and the beignets with blueberry puree. Both the omelet with lobster mushrooms and crepes were equally delicious. The beer: I only had the Blanche which was great, it would be worth coming here in the middle of the afternoon just for a snack and a beer!I would recommend this to anyone, both native and tourist! Coming from out of town it was nice to get out of the ""touristy"" areas and to eat somewhere that felt much more authentic and real. 10 times better then you are going to find in Old Port.Hope this was helpful!"
