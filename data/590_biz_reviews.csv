/user_details?userid=q7a5NR0Tj6PNIjWxmQjLoQ,Lucy G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. This is a quintessential Montreal diner, complete with smoked meat, poutine, and pizzaghetti.If this place ever closes I will greatly mourn it's departure and forever harbor resentment towards whatever establishment replaces it.My typical order is a breakfast (bacon, eggs tourner) or a smoked meat sandwich. The poutine is killer, thick cut darkly browned fries mount a stack of chunky curds and rich gravy. The curds are more squeaky than melty, which is a nice departure from some of the soupier poutines I've encountered (whom I am also eternally grateful for.)I appreciate that they're open from morning to fairly late, so you can grab something hearty after a nearby concert or on the way home with a pack of dep beers in hand. Five stars, I will come back again and again."

/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Though my partner and I disagree, I think Greenspot has one of the best poutines in Montreal. The cheese curds here are literal perfection, perfect quantity and mouthwatering squeak. The fries are always made fresh and don't get too soggy. The gravy is very dark and rich here and I love that. My boyfriend doesn't like this so maybe it's not for everyone.Excellent hot dogs as well! All very affordable. I have eaten here and taken out multiple times and it has always been a positive experience. Can't comment on the rest of their large menu but hoping to try more items soon!"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Growing up I always went to green stop located on monk in vile emard but this location is called green spot. I know it's pretty similar but they are worlds apart and by worlds apart I mean 15 minute drive haha.So they opened in 1947 They have the same layout as back in the dayOld school dinner vibes Loads of coming and going And the volume is at a max in here.Poutine= mehhhh I mean curd cheese 10/10 solid cold huge chunks. Fries are way to big half cooked half not. Gravy taste like they dropped the salt shaker in it. I know they make it but it's too salty.Pizza= it's not a pizza place let's just say that.Hot dogs well how can you go wrong with that. They get 10/10 for their steamies.The people are sweet but working hard and fast so don't feel offended if they don't smile as much as the next place.I suggest grabbing two hot dogs and maybe a onion ring
/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"On the quest to find the best poutine in Montreal, I just had to stop by the Green Spot.They have a bevy of poutine options but I opted to get the classic one. The fries are on the thicker side and the gravy has a very deep flavor. The poutine gravy definitely seems like it cooks for a pretty long time, so it tastes pretty salty. Not my favorite but an establishment that has been a neighborhood spot for a very long time."
/user_details?userid=lhrleFTsOw91vEUY1s871A,Morgan H.,"Fairfax, VA",3 star rating,"We stopped here around lunchtime on a Saturday while visiting Atwater Market. This place is located on one of the streets that borders the market. It has a rather eclectic menu with a long list of poutine, standard breakfast platters, Italian, Greek, burgers, salads... everyone should be able to find something. Despite being very busy during lunch, we were able to get a booth without waiting and had the choice of breakfast and lunch items. It has a bit of an American diner feel with  bar stools, unlimited coffee,  huge portions, large menu and quick service. I had the chicken souvlaki skewers which had seasoned rice, thick cut fries, salad and tzatziki. Overall a very substantial meal for the price. The chicken was moist, and well seasoned as was the rice. The fries were similar to those used in poutine so extra thick and soft...not my favorite. I loved that this place had breakfast and lunch all day so we did not have to choose.One thing is it took us a while to realize that we had to go to the counter to pay. Overall, a good experience in a great location by Atwater."
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",3 star rating,"If this isn't one of the go-to spots for curing hangovers in Montreal, I don't know what is.  It's a greasy spoon in all the right, and unfortunately, wrong ways.  Perched in Saint Henri since 1947, I loved the throw-back vibe and decor.  It's not kitschy: it just is what it is.  Loved the cozy booths and jukeboxes, loved the crowded atmosphere filled with everyone from vintage-wearing hipsters, grandparents and their grandchildren, young families, glamorous couples, ordinary-working Joes, and more. Everyone under the sun.This is my vibe, and I can certainly appreciate diner food.  Not expecting fancy, not at all, but comfort food that fills the stomach and calms the nerves.  Unfortunately, my ham and swiss crepe was just not good.  The batter tasted like thinned out pancake mix - not the buttery sponginess of a true crepe - and the cheese had not even melted.  It was still in it's square form.  The hash browns had all the requisite crunchy bits, so high praise from me, but by husband found them bland.  His ham and fried eggs were okay, he shared, with his brown toast being his favorite part of the meal.Though we waited a few after being seated for one of the busy, scurrying waitresses to say hello, once ours appeared, she did so with two mugs of hot coffee.  She didn't even ask: she read our minds.  High marks for that gesture!I would go back, perhaps for lunch, and order their poutine if I was in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip from another neighborhood (I find Beauty's in Le Plateau much, much better).  I'd go again for breakfast and stick to something like eggs and bacon, better still on a breakfast sandwich.  I'm not sure what bagels they use - St.Vinateur or Fairmount.  They didn't say and I didn't inquire.  For breakfast for two, plus tip, for under $25.  That's a price that you can't argue with, especially in a city that seduces you with a plethora of dining options. One could easily spend twice that amount on avocado toast at another cafe.  You won't find avocado toast on the menu here, and come to think of it, that's a very fine thing indeed.  It's good to be reminded of another era of dining, where a cozy booth with good friends and family is about as good as it gets."

Or bacon. Or onions.The kind of place where the waiters cut your pizza at the table for you.The kind of place where you feel like the chefs have worked there for 50 years.The kind of place where a portion of lasagna comes to you in one size only, and that size is ""brick"".This place is a heartwarming, good, old-timey experience that will fill you up with joy in the most low-key way. No bells or whistles, no tablecloths, no dress code, just good, hot, unhealthy food, served quickly and with a smile.And it's all 1950s themed, so feel free to pretend you're on your second date with the dreamboat from the football team and you really really hope he asks you to go steady before prom"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Greenspot is a Montreal classic. It opened in 1947 corner of Greene and Notre Dame (hence the name Greenspot) and served up just hamburgers and hotdogs. In 1989 it moved across the street but kept its 1947 decor and expanded it's menu to breakfast and lunch. I really liked their breakfast, it's a classic diner breakfast with huge portions for just $10. I highly recommend getting a breakfast plate with their smoked meat, it's delicious!I also love their hotdogs and poutine! I tried their green spot hotdog, which is topped with a pickle mayo sauce. Looking forward to trying their other hotdogs next time! Their poutine nis Also fantastic. Fries are perfect, sauce is delicious and they are generous with the cheese curds. Bon appetit rated the greenspot poutine as #3 in Montreal. Awesome spot! Load up on food and then walk it off by the Lachine canal ;)"

The service is solid and the food is without pretention. If you are looking for a diner meal, this is as good as it gets!I basically got the largest breakfast platter available. Two pancakes, baked beans, house potatoes, ham, bacon, sausage, smoked meat, fruit and 2 eggs for under $15. Holly Molly that is a good deal. I'm use to only getting half of that for that price!! Also, I like the crowd that gathers here. There is a mix of characters, personalities and neighborhood staples that seem to gather here. It's a fun place to people watch while having a massive breakfast."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We were a group of four looking for a place to grab Sunday brunch so we came here at the suggestion of a friend.  Greenspot is an old school diner that has been around for years and serves as a reminder of St-Henri's working class roots.  If you love diners you will love it here because they have preserved that look.  You will even find jukeboxes at the tables.  While it does get busy on a Sunday we were seated quickly because the dining room is sufficiently large.The menu features all the breakfast classics like bacon and eggs, pancakes, etc.  The meals all include coffee or tea and the wait staff come around regularly to top up your mugs.  I got a deluxe plate which featured a bit of everything and I enjoyed it although the bacon could have been a bit crispier and the pancakes a little fluffier.  This review also wouldn't be complete without giving a shout out to our great waitress.  She handled us swiftly and accommodated some of our special requests with ease.  One of my friends, who had ordered the omelette was hoping to switch up his toast for French toast and we originally thought it wouldn't be possible since French toast was only listed as a main and not a side.  She however managed to make it happen.Also, you know what else I like about Greenspot?  It is so affordable.  I think my meal was less than $15 after tip.  As much as I love a more high end brunch I also enjoy the budget friendly ones in places like these."
/user_details?userid=zchBNy-RDGIk5RhPrKdK6g,Rebecca G.,"Cranford, NJ",5 star rating,"I could not say one bad thing about this place. The atmosphere even at its busiest is charming and has such a classic diner feel (being from New Jersey, we know and love diners very much). It was my very first time having Poutine and it was absolutely delicious. I also recommend the smoked beef sandwich, the meat is so tender and juicy it's like butter. Overall, so glad we were in the area and picked this spot up on our yelp search."
/user_details?userid=7iZOLfdpS_iRYLR7hi6hPg,Cole S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely my favourite restaurant in Montreal. I've been going here since I was 4 years old (33 years of loving the Greenspot!) I remember when it was still across the street on the south side of Notre Dame, in the 1980s! They still have the old table top jukeboxes, tho sadly they don't work anymore. You can still flip through and see all the song choices available from the 90s. Best fries, best milkshakes, true retro feel. 70+ years in business and still growing strong."
/user_details?userid=LmJgBc71zZZPeHpEZpx1dA,Seanzor F.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place doesn't disappointsMy Order: -Hamburger with bacon and cheddar cheese-Water-PogoFood: The food was really good, the beef Pattie in was made from actual ground beef and hand made at some point oooo and it came with red cabbage on the side. The pogo was standard out of the box and fried. If I had to complain about anything it would have to be the fries that came with the burger were cut into GIANT SLICES and flash fried, almost like wedges but bigger and more tasteless. I should have taken the salad but meh..the giant fries were nice to nibble on after my meal. The Environment:It's a very clean and friendly place, the tables are clean and the washrooms are clean with no issues. The staff is very friendly and hard working to get food out to you as fast and as tasty as possible, never really had to wait long for a table but it's never that long. Overall:I love this place and have never been disappointed in the food, the menu is MASSIVE and could be cut down by 75% but to just have the option of.....anything is kinda nice. I've been here many times over the years and have yet to be disappointed in anything here, quick everything and amazing taste.  It's a must visit place when coming to Montreal"

The food is also amazing. I ordered a smoked meat platter which came with a coleslaw salade and fries on the side. The platter was huge and everything tastes fresh. I think their smoked meat is better than the famous Schwartz's, it was juicy and surprisingly I didn't feel uncomfortable afterwards though the meal was heavy. Apart of that, the service was pretty fast which is another plus."
/user_details?userid=Y_h-nrOIIZWBF-AFzdQbgQ,Matthew P.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,Not much to say . I liked it her was good not to expensive also I had mostly great service just wish my waitress came by more to fill my water. Nice old school look apparently they been here since 1947 if that's true they must be doing a few right things. Lunch special was a good price tasted good better then I was expecting I'd come back if I'm around neck of the woods again.

Came in with a craving for typical greasy Canadian food and got what we expected. I ordered a steamed hot-dog with a side of fries and a side dish of onion rings. While the food itself was not extraordinary, there prices were decent. The hot-dog and fires costed 2.35$ while the side onion rings costed around 4$. Definetly enough food to fill up under 10$. The ambiance was pretty cool too with lots of locals eating there. Went there on a Saturday evening and it was quite crowded but no line-up. You just sit down at your table and someone will come serve you. Service was pretty good too. Will come back later with en empty stomach!"
/user_details?userid=V_RUOIUIH6-fdCxUrPclFQ,Annika B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Poutine was terrible. Worst poutine I've ever eaten. Made me want to throw up. It tasted like bad expired BBQ sauce or period blood. Service was just as bad.
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: Notre-Dame West. The closest  subway is probably Lionel-Groulx, and street parking is available (metered).The place: Old-school diner type of establishment, with mini jukeboxes on the tables and the menu splattered across the wall. Don't expect fancy decor because you won't get it. The food: I ordered a club sandwich that came with fries and coleslaw. My plate was HUGE! the club was fresh and delicious and the fries were excellent. There's not much more I can say about that.Service: Very slow. We waited a while before anyone came to seat us, then we had to wait again for someone to acknowledge our table. Then we had to wait again for our orders to be taken, then delivered. There seemed to be a hell of a lot of waitresses on the floor so I'm not really sure why service was as slow as it was. Price point: I think the club was $14, but you really get your money's worth. You can easily split the club between two people and leave there feeling satisfied."

/user_details?userid=KcZOGv_2fnDZyRTnfqD1FA,Antoine C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Where to start? The Greenspot is an institution in the area. It's cheap, it's good and the decor is spot on! Every time I go there I love those tiny jukeboxes on the tables even though they don't work anymore. They're vestiges of the past when things were probably simpler. But here I am digressing. I tried many dishes and never once was I disappointed. Between the hot dogs, the pizza, and the burgers, anyone can be satisfied. But I have to say that my favorite from their place is the poutine. Not healthy, but so damn good! I took one with bacon once and below the mountain of guilt was a heaven with a tasty sauce, ""fleshy"" fries, squeaky cheese of course and bacon! But let's just not stop there as they serve one of the most killer cheesecake ever! Covered with strawberry jam (maybe a little bit too much by the way) it's so good and satisfying. Greenspot is a safe bet!"

/user_details?userid=C-QKyxxPkCGAldtjj7dW7g,Michael D.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"Was looking for some food when we arrived late in the area on a statutory holiday. Despite being afraid we would be stuck with McDonalds, we were blessed with this hopping diner and its bevy of takeout options.To be honest the menu was a bit overwhelming in terms of volume and options. I relied on some great looking Yelp photos to select two poutines  for my wife and I. Too bad they did not have a size comparison on the photos, because they were gigantic. We did not even finish one, so next time we will split a large order or perhaps even a small. They were both delicious, but the gravy on the Le Gadboi (poutine with hot dogs and onion rings - trust me it's obscenely good) made that dish the winner.The atmosphere is full on classic diner and the place was hopping this night. Staff spoke English (several conversed amongst themselves in English) and everyone was very polite. I had take out, but they had some French mircrobrews advertised.Most of the pictures on here are of sandwiches, poutine, burgers, and hot dogs. While I was there I saw a variety of fish dishes and some Greek specialities.We will probably return for breakfast. Would be easy to eat for under $10 and hard to go across the $15 mark."
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Poutine: attention salt assault. The gravy will come and murder the soul of all the other ingredients so you might as well go for the classic no add-on poutine. Awesome fries. These unsalted thick-cut meaty fries come with a nice crisp on the outside. They're a bit crispy to eat on their own imo but in a poutine they're great.Steamie: did you see the size of that sauerkraut? It's a humongous and that's how I want it. Plus it's served on a plate giving an added sense of abundance. Thank you I will gladly pay $2 for that hot dog.Someone mentioned smoked meat here. While enjoying my greasy late-night dinner at the counter, I watched as one of the guys in the prep area took out a big piece of Lester's smoked meat brisket from the fridge and mounted it on the cutter. The mystical machine then sliced and simultaneously steamed the smoked meat, giving thin hot slices of smoked meat on the plate as if it came out fresh from the smoker. So that's how it's made, huh! What a sacrilege. Seeing my curiosity, the kitchen guy gave me half a sandwich to try and to non-surprise, it tasted like standard hot dog joint smoked meat, salty, too dry, and lacks spice - nothing close of the authentic stuff."

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a Montreal landmark and has been here literally forever.Sitting in a neighborhood which is rapidly undergoing gentrification, Greenspot is a reminder of the working-class blue collar roots of the Saint Henri neighborhood back in the day, long before all the factories became chi-chi condos and aging hipsters moved in.Prices have steadily been going up, it's still nice to come here once in a while see the old table-top jukebox selections, order some old classics like burgers and fries or an old fashioned eggs and bacon breakfast. Sometimes it's nice to go to places which don't change very much especially in this hectic day and age."

I ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a regular poutine, which cost around 17 CAD. The smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. They put a fair amount of meat and the taste was great. It might seem expensive for a sandwich, but the generous amount/portion compensates for it. However, the poutine wasn't as good as I expected. They must've assumed the gravy to melt the cheese but it didn't. The cheese was completely intact and separate from the fries. It tasted like pieces of rubber. Overall, the food from Greenspot is alright, but the price might be a little high for students like me."

The prices are quite affordable, the size of the dishes is huge, and the environment is a bit vintage. You really feel that you have gone back 50 years across time. Here is the thing though, the service is not always the best, some waiters are just overwhelmed and some others are just great. I recommend to have the Benedictine Eggs, they are amazing!"

/user_details?userid=fhNyj1JsyRHUjW2YnmWhfA,Helen Adilia A.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I have a soft spot for classic greasy spoon's alla Montreal! Green Spot has recently been injected with some new life after its re-design. New shiny light fixtures and floors topped with a nice copper tin ceiling add to the old fashioned feel of the place. If your looking for a great place for breakfast or for you standard diner classics this it. Friendly service and classics, like smoked meat, michigan style poutine and spaghetti and meat sauce. If your in Saint Henri or near the Atwater market stop buy and have a nice greasy breakfast!"

We wanted to eat brunch but it was past 3 pm. Then I saw that this place serves brunch all day! I had eggs with french fries and smoked meat and it was both cheap and tasty. The regular coffee was also very good!"

/user_details?userid=bEN3YFA6g8AavPTF-zs8Iw,R L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food is not cheap and is not very good. The place isn't very clean.  It's been open for a long time. If you want to pay for nostalgia rather than quality, this is great."
/user_details?userid=wo632pzj23-Di2RakSugjQ,Jeff O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",4 star rating,"You can't help but marvel at its legend. Check the old signs and jukeboxes and settle in for this greasy spoon. Montreal has some awesome greasy spoons. I always search for them in any city - you get the heartiest dose of a culture there, without a tourism board directing you there. The steamed hot dog with cole slaw on it was great. Loved it. Poutine was fine fine, and I found out that a ""Pogo"" is a corndog. Cool!"
/user_details?userid=Afa1kxZD0GYDTLyh9TB0Bw,Thomas J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I would say that the Greenspot is one of the biggest hidden gems in Montreal. This place has every single type of food you could imagine. The menu is huge and everything is so good. It has a very old school feel to it. The seating is very comfortable and you get to choose where you would like to be seated. The food comes very quickly and the staff are extremely friendly.  I would recommend trying a poutine there as they seem to be the most popular item.
/user_details?userid=Drr9IQ_VnB-8yiUyt-jBPw,Cently R.,"Paris, France",5 star rating,"This charming dinner whisks you away to simpler times! It has a very authentic 1950's American dinner vibe. And just so happens to have the greatest chili dogs north of Coney Island! The food is typical diner food, along with some Greek plates and all very reasonably priced. The service has always been excellent and I love drinking a cold coca cola from a tall glass bottle!  Definitely go!"
/user_details?userid=HXVx8dG5KxQZog6kdDraWg,Nicole S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Classic Montreal greasy spoon in a recently revamped diner setting. Staples like poutine and smoked meat, and some new menu items like pizza and souvlaki. Open later on weekends, a great stop for some drunken take out, but equally good for sit down breakfast. Coke in bottles, coconut cream pie, copper ceiling!"
/user_details?userid=PZzyUCVgy6dDl_UryVzVbQ,Cédric M.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,One of my favorite places for poutine. The fries are tasteful and reminds me of my grandpa's. The gravy sauce is so dirty it makes me want to roll myself over in it....ok maybe not that good but close.
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Really nothing special by montreal standards. The place is dirty and run down. I don't need my hot dog joint to be spotless, but maybe they should rename this place ""brownspot"""
/user_details?userid=jrV3hEXXYstsjyrYDB2eWg,Ptra S.,"Mono, Canada",5 star rating,"The quintessential Montreal breakfast place with fair prices, expert wait staff and great breakfasts. An excellent mixture of tattooed St Henri denizens and police and ambulance folks on meal break."
/user_details?userid=tEZsTQEkZSK0RMjYZoZzZA,Hani A.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Canada",5 star rating,It's diner licious ! But no draft beer. Souvlaki chicken pita and classic poutines are great.
/user_details?userid=H1YvbL4MZhNebm8Cz50hlg,Liz F.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for the poutine, ended up going all-out and ordering the poutine with smoked meat on top. It was very tasty, though probably enough sodium to last me all month! The jukeboxes and decor were cute."
