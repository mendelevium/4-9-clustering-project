I loved it as a child and still do as an adult, so I searched yelp and decided on this lovely venue. Covid ordering: you can order online through their website and pick it up in person. Once you order it takes 20 mins for the dishes to be prepared.The general tao chicken was perfect and simple and yes it was a smashing hit with my son! Melted in my mouth and wasn't greasy or too saucy. They also have a tofu general tao that I want to try next!I loved the noodles in the Chow Mein. My son really enjoyed the broccoli. Next time I want to get a dish that has extra broccoli. The singapore rice vermicelli was excellent as well, if you're in the mood for a curry flavored Asian dish definitely go for it. Their beef with satay sauce is really good too. The beef is thin and tender.Parking can get tricky in Chinatown so you will have to walk a minute or two as there isn't parking right outside."
/user_details?userid=D-jIQQUo6bz-sdVezLa7Wg,Shan G.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,plate is big and serve you lots of food. The only issue is their red pepper is not spicy. I would like to call it Cantonese restaurant.
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you like spicy, this is the place for you. If you're scared of spicy food, well this is also the place for you. Their menu has a huge variety of yummy food, spicy and non spicy. So this place is perfect if you like noodles, chicken, beef, spicy, seafood, and the list goes on and on. The service is super quick. The food arrives after blinking a few times. We always got served by the same waiter and hes very nice and funny. For a restaurant in chinatown, this place is so damn clean. So yes, do try it here."

The menu is extensive (many of the usual Sichuan dishes you would expect). I shared an order of General Tao chicken, double fried beef (highly recommend!!), and Singapore noodles. Everything was delicious. There are so many other things on the menu I want to come back and try. Some reviews mentioned problems with service. I did not have that experience at all. Very friendly, very helpful."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I love discovering new cool places. We got to this place be accident (everything else we tried was closed). If your are looking for a cheap fast food prices this is not the place for you (restaurant prices 8-12 $ per dish), but if you are looking for an experience and good food you have arrived. The place was packed with locals (99% Asians, and in a Chinese restaurant this is always a good sign) so we knew its going to be good.I would advise you to skip on the cucumber salad (not that unique) but the eggplant dishes were amazing and I loved the Lotus roots dish. Great food, a little oily, a little spicy but trust me  you will leave satisfy."
/user_details?userid=mfwAsQU3_TlZgkkkjZMtQQ,Susan C.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Solid Chinese cuisine in the heart of Montreal's Chinatown. Looking at the menu and website, it appears that this restaurant serves Sichuan cuisine. However, there are plenty of non-spicy traditional foods that you can also order. My colleagues and I arrived as a group of 6 on the evening of the mid-autumn festival. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated at a round table after just a few minutes wait. The staff spoke English as well as Mandarin. We didn't try to speak to them in French. We ordered various dishes - kung pao chicken, General Tso chicken, orange chicken, egg tofu and egg plant, beef on a sizzling plate, satay beef and the house special fried rice. We also ordered one order of steamed white rice for about 3 people. The dishes came quickly after ordering and we were impressed that the guy taking our orders knew all the numbers/dishes pairing as some ordered by number and others ordered by the name of the dish! We also had three orders of Tsingtao beer.The taste was great. Tea was refilled. And the staff were able to split our final bill by 6. We paid at the counter at the entrance. We also noticed quick turnaround and good rapport with the customers. Will definitely be back next time I am at Montreal Chinatown."

When we asked for water, a tiny glass was given. When we asked for takeout boxes, the server dropped a container on the floor. I asked for a new container, and he was not happy. They have no service in mind at all."

Loved their shrimp wonton soup and peanut butter sauce wontons. General Tao chicken, mixed fried rice and the seafood hot pot was all really good and we had plenty left over for dinner the next day."
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is the type of restaurant I was taken to by friends and for business when I travelled to China. The menu is variate with many dishes I would have loved to try. It's actually perfect for a group as you can order several dishes and share them. I took the beef with satay sauce and I was not disappointed. Pricier than other places but totally worth it.
/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We ordered Kung Pow Shrimps, chicken fried rice, beef satay, shrimp wonton soup and sweet and sour soup. Everything was really good, except the kung pow shrimp sauce was too sweet. I especially liked their wontons, it was packed with shrimp patties and was actually filling unlike measly wontons you usually get at other Chinese places. Food also came out super fast even though it seemed fairly busy. And the waitress was really nice, she made friendly conversations and checked on us every now and then."

This is a small restaurant in Chinatown, our food came out quick. I will recommend the Singapore noddles though because I'm sure anybody that's not as picky as me will love them! It was just the flavor of it that didn't fully convince me."

I've yet to try one that makes me not want to finish my meal. In addition to that, the service is very friendly with a staff that are likeable and funny. The wait for the dishes is not long at all, too. I knock a point because the menu presentation and interior of the restaurant is not among the best I've seen."
/user_details?userid=CwUvSaeItqpFCDh0jHaNuQ,Lily Y.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"Food: For sure the menu offers a variety of Sichuan dishes and some variations from other regions. However, the typical Sichuan spices fragrance is missing, not spicy nor ""麻"", everything toned down probably due to high amount of tourists in the area? Unfortunate of how misrepresented Sichuan food, with everything bathed in oil and starchy sauce. No no, Sichuan food unlike that, really~Service: Euh... very... Chinese-like? - -""Price: Somewhat overpriced for the quality of the foodAmbiance: Yes clean Chinese restaurant, we like that~ Lots of lights and well spaced between tables, at least rest assured you will dine in a comfortable setting."
/user_details?userid=aMahjjxNIRvWIpf8zP8Lcg,Christopher T.,"Urbana Champaign, IL",4 star rating,"This place was nice- food was good and interior was simple and clean, perfect for small and large parties. The beef ho fun reminded me of HK, giving off the satisfying ""wok smell."" Beef and flat noodles themselves were also cooked well. Twiced cooked pork was also solid- tasted as expected. My friend also got the vegetarian fried rice- only disappoint would be the hot chill oil we asked for; it was straight up just oil. Overall, service was very fast and good, with decent portions. Would come again, especially given the abundance of items on the menu."
/user_details?userid=K8Hu4_lL-nTFG52q0FPC0Q,Alan N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"KanBai is an authentic Chinese restaurant located in Chinatown. We ordered General Tao Chicken, Fried Pig Intestine and Sour Pickled Fish Soup.Food: I think the food could be better. It met my expectations but my taste buds weren't overly excited. If you are down to try the pig intestine - do it! It was my favourite dish of the night. The soup sizes are generous and I was surprised we finished the huge bowl of Sour Pickled Fish Soup. Their spice level on their dishes is up there so if you can't handle the spice - ask for less spice.Price: We went in a party of two and it only costed $50 for two. We had 3 full dishes and a rice. I even had packed the left overs away and plan to bring it to work tomorrow. Apparently the portions were bigger than the KanBai in downtown St Catherine's.Ambience: It was similar to other Chinese restaurants within Chinatown and there wasn't anything spectacular. However, I enjoyed the overall cleanliness. I also feel that the location is quite specious so it would be perfect for bigger groups and parties."

Almost everything is available. I ordered stir fried vegetables with shrimps on. And that was so delicious. Full of Chinese people also shows that this is a good place to have dinner. Prices are reasonable."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this KanBai. I love the prompt, funny, helpful service. The folks who work here will seat you seriously and then give you a little smile and gently fill your beer glasses as you down the kirin or tsingtsao, and they will even crack jokes quietly about how spicy it is and how much food you're ordering if you get a little friendly report going with them. Last night we ordered: the spicy red pepper fish filet (which previously I ate with people who like me thought this was a soup and wondered why my eyes were weeping hot oil and my insides crying. Turns out it's not so much a soup: eat the fish and mushrooms and peppers out of the oil, don't drink it unless you like weeping burning oil tears and lighting on fire from the inside. Either way it's freaking delicious.) We also ordered the house fried rice, the spicy cabbage, and the eggplant with minced pork. This was a perfect amount of food for 4 people and with beers and tip was close to $100 total so that's nice. The restaurant is tucked up on a dim block of Clarke, around the corner from the pretty lights of the heart of our small Chinatown. It's up a few steps, it's a warm nicely decorated room in red and black and gold with one big window, clean and comfortable and an excellent way to (h)eat up the winter."
/user_details?userid=56_DKQpK4tT0rWLt4-DZOQ,Sam G.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Not fully authentic Sichuan cuisine, maybe a lighter version of it.  You have food from other regions of China and maybe a few fusion dishes.  But the food was great, everything tasted very good.  The first thing that caught our attention was how nice the waiter was, extremely friendly service, not typical for Chinese restaurant.Toronto has some of the best Chinese restaurants in North America, this one can definitely survive if it were operating in Toronto.Next time I'm visiting Montreal and are craving for Chinese food, I know where to go!The tofu in bamboo container was really great."
/user_details?userid=bxaICaGxzYHSB1MsztlGdg,Matylda K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's one of my favourite Asian restaurants. A friend who lived in Shanghai for 10 years introduced me to this place. Meals are flavourful, spicy, sweet, sour... You get it, packed with divine Asian flavour! Some of the foods may be greasy, but nothing that takes away from the taste! Interior decor is chic and it's a good place to bring groups as sharing meals is the way to go. Last time, we shared a meal with a group of omnivores and vegetarians; everyone was happy about how good the food was. Price is fair for the quantity and variety of the food. I go there every year."

/user_details?userid=vUWyWEE1g_GjRpYWCZhhlA,Patrick I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my Go-To Chinese place in Montreal. I was a huge fan of the previous restaurant in this location, New Dynasty, and I was told much of the kitchen staff had stayed when the restaurant changed hands. Indeed, many menu items remain the same -- albeit some have undergone minor changes. As others have mentioned, its renovated and very clean, and is a bit more upscale as far as Montreal Chinatown restaurants go; definitely  someplace you can go out to for a nice dinner. The food is fantastic. There's really nothing else to say about it. Everything has always been fresh and tasty. Service has been good when I've eaten there although I frequently get takeout. A bit pricier than other options, but really worth it."

Service is good and the interior is spacious. Had the spicy boiled fish and cumin lamb. The lamb is quite spicy. Also had the 红油抄手(red oil wonton) and it's quite a letdown.. not really spicy but coated with peanut butter. Only for people who likes sweet dish.

/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another KanBai!!! in chinatown this time.It's located on clark where the now closed New dynasty used to be. Completely renovated, it is now the cleanest joint in chinatown, from the dining room to the toilets, it's all modern and clean.The menu is similar to its sister restaurant KanBai on Ste-Satherine, szechuan cuisine with some Hunan and Cantonese thrown in there for good measure.We ordered seven dishes for 6 ppl, and couldn't finish everything, comes out to 21$ per person and that's a damn good deal!!! plus I ate so well. I would say the chef here is better than at the Ste-cat location, same dishes better taste!!We ordered shrimp, cabbage, calamari, tofu and eggplant, bamboo stew, fish in hot broth and beef soup.The soup came out first, it's chopped beef in egg drop style soup, it's light and subtle, save some for later you will need it. Often the dishes wil be oily and sipping some soup on the side will help balance out the too much oil feeling.The shrimp was very good, it's stir fried in soy sauce and sugar, and the sugar caramelizes the shrimps. It is shrimp with the shell on, so be warned. I like the shell on, gives it more flavor, but that's an acquired taste. The dish is on the sweet side, but with a bit of rice and soup it goes well.The bamboo shoots are different, they are not the kind you get at the supermarket, and it comes in a mini wok over a flame so it's keeps warm, very good dish. The bamboo shoots are springy and woody so they are fun to chew, and the flavor is very well balanced, tasty.Calamari and tofu eggplant are standard fare, still very good though, but the stand out discovery of the night was the cabbage!!! It's so simple I would never order this, but my friend did and boy am I glad he did.It's just cabbage stir fried with some salt, light brown sauce, and hot peppers, and some other secret powder ingredients. Eventhough it has peppers in the dish it's not spicy at all, and the cabbage looks plain stir fried but when you eat it, it is somehow infused with so much flavor.I'm happy :)"

We ordered fried rice, chicken with black bean sauce, and bok choy.  It was surprisingly delicious and the portions, huge.  My only complaint was that bok choy could have been prepared better by removing the ends or perhaps cooked a tad longer, but that didn't stop me from eating every last one.  Overall, I enjoyed this meal very much and would return."

We only ordered vegetarian plates to share since one of our friends does not eat meat and I had absolutely no regrets. Everything was extremely appetizing, generous, tasty and fresh. The sauteed szechuan cabbage and the sliced potatoes on a hot plate were my absolutely favorite. The place looks great too and easily accomodates groups of 8 thanks to the circular tables. Did I mention it was particularly cheap? Try it, you will not regret it."

/user_details?userid=8Q10whUR5XS51J_eaTaNzA,Steven K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"There is nothing more satisfying than having a craving for a particular treat, going someplace on a whim and having the dish perfectly prepared at a reasonable price.This is exactly what I experienced tonight at KanBai.  I came to Montreal specifically looking for lobster, chinese style.  I was staying around the corner and this was literally the first place I came across.It was early on a Tuesday night - just barely 5PM, but there were a couple of tables occupied already.  Once I saw they had several lobster dishes on the menu (at Market Price), I agreed to be seated.I had to decide between steamed lobster with ginger and scallion or lobster with spicy chili pepper sauce.  For a moment, I considered asking for it done with black bean sauce, since I wasn't sure about the chili sauce and it's hard to go wrong with Black Bean Sauce.Happily, I went with my gut and ordered the Lobster in Chili Sauce, which the waitress said was 22$.  As anyone who has been in these ""big table"" family style Chinese restaurants knows, the portions are usually large and made to share, so I refrained from ordering anything else besides tea (comes with anyways) and a small bowl of rice.The lobster was PERFECT.  It was, I imagine, quickly deep fried because many of the parts that would normally be inedible were rendered bits of crunchy deliciousness.  The sauce was a mouthwatering blend of salt, whole peppercorns, scallions and dried red peppers - lots of them!  I tasted a bit of sweet, but not too much.  Overall, there were several really well balanced complimentary flavors.  The lobster was succulent, lots of meat in the claws, body and of course tail - and it was split in all the right places to make getting the meat out that much easier.  The sauce was so tasty I found myself wanting to eat the head and tail as well, which I have never done before, but happily did tonight.Finally, I understand the Chinese concept of nose to tail (or perhaps antenna to back fin in this case) dining.  I simply couldn't get enough of this dish.  My only regret was that I didn't have friends to share and ooh and ahh over it with.  If you're a lobster fan, head on down and order this dish.  Don't worry - even though it's a chili pepper sauce, it's not that spicy.  It's just spicy enough to pop that flavor up a notch.  The peppercorns were a tasty surprise and definitely added a lot to this dish.It seemed like an excellent value for a really high quality meal served in a nice setting.They DO take Visa - just not MC or Amex for some reason."
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,My go to for Szechuan in Montreal. Used to be the other location on Ste Catherine but its not as good lately since they changed ownership plus this locations portions are WAY bigger but slightly more expensive. Favorite dishes are -Szechuan Cabbage-Spicy Lamb on sizzling Iron Plate-Green Beans with minced porkYou cant go wrong with any of those dishes.
/user_details?userid=J_iJtCoMlmLUEKGp6gYb-w,Tracy H.,"Balmoral, Canada",5 star rating,Best Chinese food ever! We hoped it would be good and since there were so many Asians there we were right.

Would absolutely go again.

/user_details?userid=B7f5iHcyszjiHthLr5_6zA,TC N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We were looking for a restaurant to celebrate the year end.  There were over 20 of us, and our budget was only $400 (i.e. less than $20 per person).  With this budget, all other restaurants we enquired at could only give us something really simple and  unimpressive.  Eg, a bento set from a Japanese restaurant or a pasta from a western restaurant.  Then we found Kanbai.Food here is good.  We had two tables and ordered about 8 dishes for each table.  The total bill was below $400 (excl taxes and tips).  Memorable dishes included the Water-cooked Fish (a numbing-spicy dish), deep-fried garlic Shishamo fish, the Ma-Po Toufu, roasted duck, eggplant, four-seasons beans etc.  There was even some food for us to doggy-bag.Service is as you would expect in such a restaurant - pretty efficient though harried servers (and hence don't expect small talk or niceties from them).  Can't complain, really.Ambience is above average.  It is new, and clean.  However when it is crowded, it gets really echo-ey.... something to do with its acoustics.  My main peeve, if I have to name one, is that the floor tiles are extraordinarily slippery when wet.   We came after a snow fall, and like other customers we were trailing snow into the restaurant, and slipping.  Think ice.  Indeed, would be hazardous for older folks.  For a Montreal restaurant at street level, I should think they ought to have the common sense to choose floor tiles that afford better traction even when wet."

But thanx to some chinese people leaving they told me it was good. So I said why not....I ordered the potato strips, Szechuan noodles, cumin lamb and spicey chicken(No bones). Noodles and Patatos come first.....OMG its the real think I said. It was awesome. First time ever I eat this in Montreal...then the lamb comes...home run again. Awesome...I am waiting for the climax, my favorite dish which I even asked the waiter iis it like china. Just as I was to climax from the food the walls came crashing down when the dish arrived, this was not like china but a General tao version of my LaGiJi....I complained but he told me I should have ordered with the bones. There was a miscommunication over this dish. Do not order no bones.....I still gave a 4 star as everything else was good. I will be back to try the chicken with the bones and I will rate again."
