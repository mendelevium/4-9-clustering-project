/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Sometimes I enjoy just driving around and randomly going to a restaurant. Specially a restaurant that might not have many reviews.At first when I walked in, I wasn't really drawn into the ambiance. It was painted light orange and had paintings of Greece. Greek music was playing and a few tables were full. The owner sat us down and gave us menu, the menu has a few choices but all items are authentic Greek food. You have the option to chose 3 cold mezzes for 10.95$. I ordered pickled octopus, tzaziki, and greek humus.  I didn't enjoy the mezzes at all and do not recommend the pickled octopus at all.At this point I was nervous about the meal, we had ordered grilled calmars, chicken brochette and feta lamb.They first brought us the grilled calmars and oh was it delicious, grilled to perfection not burned at all, just the perfect golden colour, it wasn't rubbery like others I've had, it was accompanied with a medley of peppers.The chicken brochette was also succulent, the chicken was sliced and grilled, it was so juicy and was on a bed of onions and green peppers with a side of tzaziki. It was really good.The lamb was also excellent, I don't like lamb at all as the smell bothers me, but in this case in did not smell at all and it tasted to good and juicy, topped with spicy feta cheese which gave it just the right about of kick.A gem that may not be know quite as well as other greek restaurants but is a must try. Skip the mezzes and go straight to the meals. I did not try the salad but it looked good. Also the have a great variety of Ouzo so if you like this, you will enjoy their selection."

We ordered alot of small dishes and a good bottle of wine and had a great time. All the food was extremly teasty, we lucked our plates drank all the wine and were very happy. The food is great, the price is ok but the only downside is the noise. The resturant has a terrible acoustic and if it is full ot is very noisy. Still I will revist this place with guests if I am in the area."

They served us a delicious side of meatballs and bread right after seating down. The service was really fast and easy-going.  We ordered the grilled calamari  and octopus.  They were delicious! The manager also greeted us and offered us ouzo! He was really nice and warm! Another  table was celebrating a birthday and he  broke a plate in their honor,  Greek style! We will definitely return once we come back to Montreal! Hopefully soon:)"

The owner came and spoke for a bit with my friends and me and served us the Saganaki.Easy to reach because it is located between Mont royal and Laurier metro stops, and affordable. My favourite Greek place in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We ordered the octopus, not tender at all. The Moussaka was not as good as the one i made at home. The lamb was overcooked. It was for a birthday dinner and desapointing."
/user_details?userid=zNPEn4aHT7qQjki2q0QkWg,Nicole R.,"Lakewood, OH",5 star rating,"We arrived around 4:30 and had the place to ourselves for a bit.  They first brought out some meatballs, hummus, olives and mushrooms with bread. It was an amazing blend of flavors!! I can't remember the name of my chicken dish but it came with chicken, green peppers and onions. The chicken was tender and a good solid portion! My friend had the chicken feta and loved it. We shared rice and veggies. It was a great meal!"
/user_details?userid=u88tOXwWGsvREODosuQIJg,Maya T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I recommended this place to a friend based off the reviews here. We went with her kids and to be honest I was a tad disappointed. The bread was old and dry (one of the kids actually even refused to eat it), we took a mix of 3 entrées which for some reason I thought will be hot but they were cold, and the menu wasn't kid-friendly. The manager though (at least I think we was) was super friendly and helpful."
/user_details?userid=UAGU4JW7MwbpT3kdvbI9jA,Alexander P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Calamari is excellent. Moussaka could use a bit of work but on the whole a really nice experience. friendly staff and reasonably priced.
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I know nil about Greek food except the run-of-the-mill kind that you find in a food court. You know, grilled chicken brochette served with some potatoes, lettuce and tzatziki slapped on a styrofoam plate that's always way too small. Perhaps this is why it took me two years to finally give this place a shot. The hubby and I went there for dinner on new year's eve, the main reason being it was frigging cold that evening and we didn't want to walk too far from home.To be honest with you, I was initially disappointed when they seated us in their upstairs dining room because it isn't as pretty as the main dining room that's visible from the sidewalk. But hey, I said to myself, at least the chalet ambiance was nice. Anyway, this review is about food so let me get to the point. I had their vodka beef stew from their specialties menu, which the server described as tender beef in creamy spicy mushroom sauce. She had me at ""creamy mushroom"". Boy what an excellent choice that was. Every bite was a delight. The downside was the plate of potatoes and steamed vegies that we ordered on the side. They were quite bland. I wonder, though, if they were purposely bland so that they wouldn't take the spotligĥt away from the main dish. My hubby had a lamb dish, also from the specialties menu, and it was equally wonderful.Lastly, a special mention goes to the complimentary appetizer which consists of these small meatballs in tomato sauce. They were quite the delicious little suckers. I'll definitely order them next time I'm there."
/user_details?userid=qwMUo8QRO_V--AcFx27OSA,Eve N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ouzeri occupies a rare niche in Montreal's Greek food scene, somewhere between the atrocious BYOB casa grecque and company and the high-end Milos. Ouzeri serves good-quality, tasty yet affordable Greek food in a casual atmosphere. The saganaki and feta lamb are must-haves. The octopus is hit-and-miss, sometimes delicious, sometimes overcooked and chewy. But overall it's very good. Be aware that the place can get quite animated. It's perfect for a get-together with friends. If you're nice you might even get offered a shot of ouzo ;-)"

The prices are very affordable and food is delicious, I recommend this place for casual dinner at any occasion."
/user_details?userid=IAlYZGVT_6B_BK8UrUYOkQ,Daniel E.,"Santa Monica, CA",4 star rating,"Not too much to say here that hasn't been said. Been looking for a quality Greek place and this scratches the itch. Mid-high end so it would work as a nice date place as well but it's the food that's important and it's right on. I've been looking for a good, fired at the table saganaki since I had my first years ago and I found it here along with multiple other well done tapas."
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I've been to Ouzeri about 4 times. I've never been disappointed. That being said I've not been blown away either. I would have preferred to rate it 3.5 stars but we can't. The service is always friendly. No complaints. I enjoy their meze plate. Don't be shy to give it a try!
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is actually huge, definitely noisy, but the energy is great. Staff is friendly and efficient even when the place is packed. My Beef Martini (a house specialty, kind of a beef stew) was really good, and so were the entrée (assorted Greek dips) and dessert (salty-yummy Greek yoghourt with almonds and honey).Good wine list, fair prices. Happy place. Will return :)"
