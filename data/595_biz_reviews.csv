/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was my first time trying Salvadorian food and it was a nice experience.The food was good, although to be honest it's not something I would eat often. Their pupusas are full of meat and their service is nice. The place is super budget friendly, you can have a cheap lunch set for less than 20$ including taxes and tip. It's worth a try!"
/user_details?userid=-DlYRcmbB8cg1zUJ7iuyTw,Spencer L.,"Monroe Township, NJ",3 star rating,The pupusas we had were the highlight of the meal I had the spinach mushrooms and queso and my friend had chicken and cheese both phenomenal. However the rest of the meal was not as good I hoped especially after the great appetizers. The enchiladas were average and the tipico was also average. From my experience I would come here solely for the pupusas
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely a fantastic find and #1 visit on our stop list from our Yelp Elite food tour.  Many moons ago our family helped a Salvadoran family get settled into Canada and I had the opportunity to try out papusas and tamales. So it was so satisfying to try them again as it had been over 15 years. Their papusas are very light and have a nice filling of pork. Them on the table was a big jar of horchata and by request they brought out a nice (creeper) of a hot sauce that was complex in flavour and a light cumin taste. Also there was a tomato based sauce that evened out the flavour! It was outstanding! To wash it down was a nice milk based drink that had a slight cinnamon flavour as well. The mixing of flavours was very complimentary and enjoyable. Eating Salvadoran food makes me wonder why Mexican food is so popular? Probably and evidently because it's border is the US. I think Salvadoran food has opportunity to become a very up and coming trend in foods. It's akin to how Chinese food was the only Asian food and now you see Japanese, Korean & Vietnamese and Indian food starting to grown in popularity! Montreal still has room to grow for Malay or Indonesian. Overall I need to come back here for a full meal! Really solid, different and delicious!"

The staff does put an extra effort to make us feel good.Small location with a big Tv just like all latin restaurants.  My only downside was that the baby chairs are huge! A kids feet will be on the table which can be messy."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Los Planes served as my introduction to the wonderful world of Salvadorian food.  I first sampled their food about a year ago and always wanted to come back for a proper sit down meal.  Well one Saturday while looking for a spot to grab lunch with a friend the opportunity finally presented itself.   It's a bit of a whole in the wall but the food is awesome.  As an added bonus it is really affordable.I started with a tamale and followed that up with pupusas. If this is your first time trying Salvadorian food then go for the pupusa.  The pupusa is kind of a corn pancake that is stuffed with a filling (meat, zucchini and hot peppers in my case) and garnished with curdito (a kind of fermented cabbage) and hot sauce.  It is amazing.  The tamale was basically a version of corn bread served with sour cream.  It was also mighty tasty and contained whole chunks of real corn.  My friend and I were here on a hot summer day so that could only mean horchata was in order.  This drink consists of ice-cold milk and a variety of spices like cinnamon.  I also tasted some hazelnut as well and it had been sweetened a bit.  It was a very refreshing treat given the temperature outside.  All of this only cost me about $13 which is really cheap considering the high quality of the food.The place doesn't have air conditioning and the day I came it was hot and humid outside so the restaurant was wildly hot inside.  I still really enjoyed my experience and I would totally come back.  After all who could say no to cheap and delicious food?"
/user_details?userid=g9DJsWXLvp7qu_ogVbMZtw,Jimmy C.,"Mascouche, Canada",2 star rating,I have been there many times ... i hate how every single latino restaurant has a TV ( this place has the telenovelas on loop )The decor too .... is very latino like .. not a lot of effort put into it ...The pupusas there were alright ... not like back in el Salvador but worth the trip...I have not been there in ages ... but since it has been open for over 20 years something that they do must be right ..!!!I don't think it deserves 2 stars but it doesn't deserve 3 either .!!!If i were to chose a Salvadorian restaurant i would go to Los planes gourmet ( own by same family ... the Son i think ) the decor is much nicer ... food more elaborated .... prices are steeper ... but hey is on St Denis.....

/user_details?userid=ulbrwY4s1CdcV0nz3Vz38g,Sara G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Los planes is my first experience with salvadorian food and definitely not my last.The food is fresh and made to order. The pupusas are little pieces of heaven especially if you add on top the tomato and the homemade spicy sauce. Try the horcheta drink on the side, it's the perfect complement to the spiciness of the dish.I can't believe I've waited all this time before trying pupusas. Don't make the same mistake I did and just go!Did I mention this place was incredibly cheap?"

Small place but clean, the service is always glad to serve you even the difficult costumer... The food lets talk about the food mmmm all the time every one of the different items I have chosen have been delicious and fresh."
/user_details?userid=2QfJ8jiO0YPQia9NuEaw4w,Guillaume G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Really good restaurant. Price is reasonable. Excellent service. The pupussas are great and freshly made!
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my favourite pupusa places for sure. The masa is light and crisp, the meat fillings and cabbage and hotsauce are all fresh, the cheese is perfectly salty and chewy. This is a friendly hole in the wall with tri++lingual service that really delivers when it comes to flavour - super savoury but still fresh and clean. Whether the place is busy or quiet it takes about the same amount of time to get your pupusas (~15 minutes) and you can see the kitchen from the cash to watch everything being made. Instead of dining in the small, familial, but a bit bare restaurant we'll usually take a stack of these home and bury ourselves under them for a day or two, happy as clams."
/user_details?userid=XYflNOEGzM6pC_JVd94Vlw,Alex A.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,By far the worst service and food EVER!!! The Horchata was too watered down. The Pupusas weren't fully cooked and slow service
/user_details?userid=RlHbVsMa-T-OWPirAkhcAA,Diena M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I would have never found this place had it not been the yelp foodie tour, but I'm so glad I got to try it because it's definitely near the top of my list for authentic cultural food in Montreal. The family owned genuine feel just makes this place that much more endearing, and you can almost imagine that you are in El Salvador at someone house and their mom or grandma is cooking and serving you food. The pupusas were super tasty and the toppings and garnishes are generously given and equally tasty and homemade.This is by no means a fancy place, you would not want to go here for a romantic dim lit dinner, you would come here for genuinely great food that makes you forget about what the tables or walls look like, because you're busy enjoying the flavours in your mouth.I will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=pnze3nAroXYFQs-8nTObcw,Riki L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If my friends didn't bring me here, I never would have found this little hole in the wall.The pupusas are fantastic. Small, stuffed crepe-like tortillas (?) stuffed with fried beans, jalapeños, pork, and cheese (at least, that's the pupusa I got). It came with two of these and a plantain on the side with cream and fried beans.My partner and I shared this and got a couple coffees (which were actually really good as well). If you're looking for something delicious, check this place out. Your wallet will be happy, too!"
/user_details?userid=kneX5ZeKlEVJ7qvg_EXBeg,Lizzy A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this pupuseria. It is just delicious. Pupusas are light and packed with flavor. Other pupusas I have tried have been greasy and heavy. Now I will never go any other place because in Los Planes, I have found my pupusa match. Love love LOVE the homemade hot sauce. I literally eat it on everything. However, it is VERY spicy and not for the faint of heart."
/user_details?userid=-y8mv6-8C-IJWsy00EWAfA,Jehanne A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great and friendly place for a taste of El Salvador in Montreal. It was our first time in a pupuseria and the staff was very helpfull explaining the menu to us. We opted for pupusas, tamal and yuca frita. Everything was made fresh in the small kitchen which you can see at the back. Though it doesn't look like much in your plate, it is very filling and good. The cheese is melting and the sauce delicious (watch for the spicy sauce which is very very -very- hot!). One of those places, you will want to go back to."
/user_details?userid=O4F1_e9MLVO7AKeGDWg5uA,Celine D.,"Halifax, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favourite pupusa place in Montreal. The toppings are way better than any other place I've ever been - crunchy, perfectly spiced, and the hot sauce is so good. The pupusas are delicious too, and the plantains aren't too oily. One of my friends complains that they don't have enough different fillings, but I don't care about that. There's bean & cheese, pork, and loroco if you ask for it. Mmmm..."
