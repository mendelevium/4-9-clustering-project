The impossible burger is incredible and puts any 'beyond meat' burger, to shame. The texture & flavours are amazing. I can honestly say that it was the best veggie burger I've ever had. The cauliflower dish, the fries, the mouhamara, the dessert brownie, EVERYTHING was so delicious! I highly recommend!"
