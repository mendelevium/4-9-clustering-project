We decided to order in for dinner! Ordered through Skip The Dishes, and received the food within 45 mins! We ordered two Triple B Burgers that had three beef patties each! And got a side of fries. The 3 Patty Beef Burger was the perfect size for us, as the patties are smashed while grilling and were on the thinner side! The quality of ingredients was excellent. But the real winner of the night was the flavour/taste of the meat!! Loved the fries as well, they tasted like McDonald's fries but lighter & crispier. Highly recommend ordering in from here the next time you are craving McDonald's/Five Guys. The taste is similar but the quality of the ingredients is definitely fresher then any fast food chain. We will definitely be ordering in again very soon!!"

My new hard-on for cheeseburgers. 1 is just not enough ! Sorry I should have taken a picture of the burger but I could not wait to eat it

Made with 100% beef, no additives, just salt and pepper for seasoning. Sandwiched in a buttery bun, melted cheese, some toppings and delicious housemade sauce. Owner is very welcoming and friendly. You definitely must try this melt in your mouth burger. We'll be back for sure!!"
