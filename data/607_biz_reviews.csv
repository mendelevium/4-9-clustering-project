They have a huge space with multiple sections.The waiting staff are truly knowledgeable and really go out of their way to take care of you.The food is amazing, be it a business lunch or a long fun dinner the choices are impeccable.There is a reason why the regulars keep coming back so often."
/user_details?userid=7Ach25kvyxGn6G8m-oT5iQ,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"Staff is absolutely dead from their ass up. Food is solid, great tuna burger, good tandoori chicken salad, good location, but just wasn't satisfied with overall experience. Waitress was so stressed and overwhelmed and the restaurant wasn't even remotely busy. Definitely a good place food-wise but service is the name of the game so not gonna cut it. would potentially give it another shot one day"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Let me first say that the staff at Taverne are some of the friendliest and most doting servers you will ever come across. They are quick with a joke (but not a light of your smoke) and do their best to ease the pain of what has often been a slow and dysfunctional kitchen. While I wouldn't call myself a regular here, I eat here with family about 4 or 5 times a year.  Don't get me wrong now. This place has a lot going for it; Free indoor parking in Westmount Square, a dark and cozy atmosphere, and a full bar with servers ready and willing to ply you with beverages. The atmosphere and clientele is akin to a Westmount country club if said club was located in the city. It's a bit of a scene, but nothing like some other establishments in this city.My issues with this establishment focus mainly on the food and the design of the menu. I like to I identify which dishes a restaurant produces as well or better than anyone else. Taverne has a warm bread pudding that might meet this criteria. Beyond that, I'm completely stumped. They try to be an Italian restaurant with a handful of pasta dishes, a French brasserie with their bavette and fries, and many other cuisines. Nothing here really knocks my socks off. Sometimes, in fact, the food is downright boring or poorly executed.Prices are high. Specials such as a rib steak can be through the roof. On a recent visit we ordered the chicken wing appetizer. For 15$ you get about 6 or 7 wings which right off the bat is annoying. Then, you notice that these wings are no bigger than your thumb. No crispiness whatsoever. Coated in what can only be described as a generic tabasco like sauce with a few crumbles of blue cheese. Guys, go to Old Orchard, go to Hurleys, go to Next Door pub. You could even try Buffalo Bills. You need a crash course in chicken wings and your license to serve them should be revoked until you can prove you can put out a meaty, flavourful wing that has some texture. Your technique of brining, smoking.....whatever...... just isn't working.We had the salmon tartare. It was tasty but forgettable and overpriced. Also, it used to come served atop a layer of avocado which has now been downgraded to cucumber. The price was not similarly downgraded however. We had some fries which were god awful. Usually the fries here are decent but this time tasted like oven baked McCain fries. Finally, my wife had the Cauliflower with middle eastern spicing and yogurt. It was edible but not memorable in any way.My BIGGEST gripe with this restaurant however is how they had the audacity to remove the 2 best items from their menu at dinner. You can no longer get their regular burger or the seared tuna burger. These 2 items used to be my favourite meals here. The burger was huge and dripping with goodness. The tuna burger was also a really nice pairing of comfort food with some finesse. I can only guess that they weren't turning an appropriate profit selling 19$ (or whatever they cost) burgers and wanted to force people to order a main course in the 35$ territory. This sucks. Maybe I don't want your take on chicken cacciatore or tired rigatoni dish. I want a burger and Taverne has ruled against me. Thanks for the memories guys!"
/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I recently had a lovely dinner here with my mother. We came early, right when the restaurant opened for dinner, so the place was fairly empty and we were able to choose where to sit. We opted for a table by the window facing St. Catherine Street (so nice to watch the busy street scene and all the passers-by. And always great to have a window seat anywhere at dusk in Montreal, to see the sky changing colors and the moon coming out). My mom says she's dined here before a few times and it's always been good. She pointed out the patio area outside, saying it's a wonderful terrace for outdoor dining in the summer. I ordered the rigatoni with meatballs and it was delicious! Ver filling, though, so I ended up bringing 2/3 of it home. My mom ordered the Caesar salad and she said it was great (she had ordered this in the past). I liked how the menu had a lot of dishes I'd call ""comfort food with a twist"": traditional but not boring. They also had 3 or 4 specials of the day written on the board by the entrance, and these dishes appeared to be more contemporary (and pricey).Beautiful looking old-fashioned bar. And nice open kitchen to see the chefs in action at the rear. It was odd that we had different people/servers who took our order, brought us our dinners, checked up on us mid-meal, and who brought us the check and my doggie bag of left-overs when we were done (three different servers in total!). Weird. But I can't say that we were left unattended at any point: our water glasses were always kept full and we never waited long for anything. And all our various servers were friendly and nice. When we left, the restaurant was over half full. Looked like there were lots of regulars there, too. That's always a good sign."

My first experience taught me to not bother looking at the menu. While the menu items are amazing also, I've found that their specials on this day were so well thought out and put together, that I had to go with their lamb tagliatelle that was ok tonight. Stunning dish!!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Tavern  the square is ok. My group ordered:- Their specialty mac n cheese: was decent, but I wouldn't classify as a mac n cheese since a tomato sauce was involved. Dish includes black truffle - couldn't see, taste, or smell any of it. Nonetheless the dish tasted fine.- Homemade tagliatelle with veal: Good dish. The pasta was a tad thick for my own taste - but nothing too disappointing. The veal and overall sauce was excellent.- Caesar Salad: the dressing was the highlight if you enjoy the taste of anchovies. I didn't like that the salad was presented with whole romaine leaves (made it tougher to eat) and the fried polenta as a substitute for bread crumbs fell flat. I don't think I'd order this again.- Braised beef rib: this was excellent (not memorable but excellent). The best dish of the evening.- Wagyu tartare: solid execution and the Wagyu is a noticeable improvement to filet mignon.- Salmon tartare: unimpressed. Seemed like there was substantially more avocado than salmon.Overall, this order with two Bloody Caesars, a juice, and a coffee costed $300 - so quality you get for the price is below Montreal standards. As a result, I probably won't revisit."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I never understood the hype about this place - having been here about 3-4 times for lunch with work, I still find myself confused at the great reviews. Yes, the food is fine (fine, not great), but the service is hit and miss, and the prices are high for what you get. Not much else to say except that there's nothing special about Taverne Sur Le Square!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  Have come several times for lunch and dinner.  Lunch is usually very good, they have lots of menu options including several excellent meal salads and specials.  At night, the place is very lively with loud conversation and music.  This can be good or bad, depending on what you want, but sometimes it gets so loud you end up shouting at the person across from you.  The food at dinner has been hit and miss, I've had some very good meals here and some very mediocre ones.  For the price, sometimes I've been disappointed.  Service is spotty too, it's usually friendly but can get slow, especially at night, when we have waited up to 45 minutes on occasion for our food."

This place was pretty darn good and was perfect for our party of 7 on a Friday night during Jazz Festival!

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My office is nearby and there are a limited number of places within walking distance that are suitable for a business lunch. As a result I find myself at Tavern from time to time. My experiences here range from poor to mediocre. The food is nothing to write home about and the prices are high. Today I paid approximately $20 for a salad that consisted of canned tuna, lettuce and some olives. They seem to be consistently under staffed during lunch as my colleagues and I regularly find ourselves waiting extended periods of time to be served, as was the case today. There seems to be a stark difference between this location and the Tavern on Monkland which I remember as being a good restaurant. The best thing I can say about this place is that the fries are pretty good. Honestly there is no good reason to eat here other than that it is connected to my office building, and even then I try to avoid it at all costs."

/user_details?userid=U2OPJc9c1q7VToeKeTZ-UA,Kevin W.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,Good atmosphere. The late night special is a good deal compared to the regular menu (the food is ok quality but overpriced). Have gone here with friends as part of large groups (birthdays etc) and have always enjoyed ourselves. The outdoor terrace is nice in the summer.
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"With the rapid succession of new restaurants that open in Montreal, it is sometimes very easy to focus on the new stuff without considering some older more established spots. Just because they aren't new doesn't mean they aren't worth visiting. I was reminding of this a few weeks ago when I met up with my girlfriend and some of her co-workers for a post-work dinner at Westmount Square and more specifically at Taverne Sur Le Square, a place I had never been to before somehow.The second of chef Stephen Leslie's three restaurants - after Monkland Taverne and before Le Sieur d'Iberville - Taverne Sur Le Square called itself comfort food with international twist. The space is one befitting its place in Westmount Square - one of our city's architectural beauties. The open room is warm and welcoming while keeping that touch of refinement. We chose to sit outside on the terrasse gently lit by patio lights strung across the space. Because of the risk of rain that evening, we were pretty much alone out there - one should never turn down some terrasse time especially with how short terrasse season is for us but I digress....Looking at the menu, I decided to go with the table d'hôte whereas my girlfriend went with a couple of starters for a lighter dinner. My selection of the table d'hôte gave me a salad to start - very simple and served with roasted seeds over top. The roasted flavour of the seeds was a nice touch. The portion was very generous as well - very uncommon as a table d'hôte starter.My girlfriend's first starter, the salmon tacos with Pico de gallo and avocado, was a slight miss. Loved the soft tortillas and the creamy avocado and the fish was fresh but it felt bland. The pico de gallo didn't have much punch to it and the portion felt a little small even as an entree.The second starter was more along the right track - Grilled octopus with chickpeas and red pepper puree, sauce vierge, parsley and red onion. The octopus was plentiful and grilled nicely with just a bit of char to it. The puree was nice and creamy and the sauce vierge paired nicely with the whole thing.As a main, I decided to go with the soft shell crab served in a bun with remoulade, tomato, pickle, lettuce and tavern sauce. This item was the reason I went with the table d'hôte for a change. The soft shell crab was plentiful and had a great crunch. Add some fresh veggies, a creamy sauce all put between a great soft bun and you had an awesome sandwich to enjoy. Plus, it was served with a nice of wonderfully crunchy fries to enjoy. Goodness all around.  The last I got to try was their creme brûlée - always a sucker for a creme brûlée and a little sweetness to finish off a meal. A very solid creme - nice caramelization on the top with a richness and creaminess underneath.Despite a couple of neutral or slight misses, my first experience at Taverne Sur Le Square was a solid one. You can see how this restaurant has survived being in the relatively dead zone restaurant wise for over 14 years now. A place where you can grab a quick bite and drink after work or have a nice refined dinner for a special occasion. Taverne on the Square isn't perhaps on the forefront of the ""Hot"" restaurants in Montreal but if you willing to deviate from the current trend and try a classic, you may wonder why it's not on that list to begin with.Cheers!"

Poor service (what service???) and cheap poorly executed food...$185 later, nope shall not return ever.We were sitting down for more then one hour, and no one even asked us whether we wanted bread... C'mon!  Finally we got some, with some butter... However, we were given a little piece of butter and bread from another table which had drops of either wine or coca cola on it! Disgusting!! We were so starving we only realized after we starting eating the bread. Should be reported to the health and food authorities!We had the Mac and Cheeze with the pancetta... Heu, still looking for pancetta!They must be joking!Never again.There are so many other choices in Montreal, stay away! So arrogant this place, and overpriced. Nope, never again."

Ambience and atmosphere is pretty standard given that it is in a mall. The most stand-out aspect of the restaurant was the exceptional service. Service is rarely the highlight of my meal, but the staff at Taverne truly went above and beyond the whole night. I ordered the lamb rack that came with a side of shepherds pie which was a very tasty spin on this home-cooked classic. The main was also paired with a delicious cream of tomato soup to start. In terms of food though I have to say my favourite course was the salmon tartare we had to start."

(We went in summer.) The tuna burger was sublime (I still daydream about it) and surprisingly filling. The only reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that I found it a bit pricey for lunch, still the service and quality were excellent."
/user_details?userid=tB6vkXCS_8PIh-T9g8t6IQ,Bonjour B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been here for lunch many times, since it's near my work. And I've been once for dinner. I like the location, as it's hard to find restaurants in Westmount. But, it's expensive for what you get. Service is usually fine. The menu is kind of limited and does not change very often. The dinner seems really overpriced. It's not their fault, but the Westmount Square bathrooms are the only ones available, and you have to leave the restaurant. Those bathrooms are often kind of smelly and not consistently cleaned. I'll go back for lunch every now and again, and I'm sure it will be fine, as usual."
/user_details?userid=zzgb9L3NBT9V8BGw_DcVYw,Belle D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There are so many things to love about Taverne on the Square. Taverne is like an old friend - like a friend with whom you can pick up right where you left off even if you haven't seen each other in a while. A friend you can count on. A friend who welcomes you back with hanger steak, among other things.Why? At Taverne, the service, food and atmosphere are consistent and always spot on. Waiters are perfectly attentive and friendly without being overbearing, the bistro-style food is always mouthwateringly delicious and the warm room is always full of hustle and bustle. It's even consistent with its clientele, which ranges from older Westmount ladies insisting on a particular table to younger groups of friends enjoying festive dinners.For the tartare lovers out there - Taverne makes a mean one. The ingredients are so fresh, and somehow, even the avocado is always buttery and delicious. It comes with somewhat flaky fried ""chips"" and a little bit of balsamic reduction. One of my favorite tartars in the city.And the hanger steak? Hands down, the best in the city. The steak is always grilled to perfection no matter how you like it cooked (but I suggest medium-rare), and it comes with an amazing bordelaise (red wine) sauce and a nice, lightly dressed, salad. The cut of meat is always ridiculously fresh.Finally, this is a Montreal restaurant that doesn't falter at dessert!  I haven't tried them all, but the ones I've had were completely satisfying. The best? The Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookie. Yeah, that's actually what it's called, and it does that name justice.Taverne's cookie is baked on the spot in a mini-pan, so when you get it, it's warm and 100% ooey gooey. The dough is obviously sweet, but it has that salty touch I so adore inhautechocolate chip cookies. Oh, and they use dark chocolate chips and put vanilla ice cream on top. I'm getting hot just thinking about it.Some will carp that Taverne can be chi-chi and pretentious, but really, Taverne's just a classy place with great food whose clientele happens to be well-dressed and good-looking, in a Westmount kind of way. Go, have a wonderful time and leave with a satisfied, warm, fuzzy feeling. And don't hate it 'cause it's beautiful.Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere (buzzing&happening) 9/10, Pretty people 9/10, Service 9/10."

The burger was too dry and the bun a bit charred, however the seafood linguini with pancetta was great! The red lentil and coconut soup was also pretty good. Their service is superb! Amazing attention to detail, servers backing each other up (constantly checking to ensure that customers aren't lacking anything). To point out, our bread was checked on twice and our water was refilled twice more, even before the soup arrived, and that was about 7 minutes after we ordered. This level of service and attention was maintained throughout the service courteously."
/user_details?userid=nPGpQNK2qo_j2M1ZrrcSsg,Danielle F.,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,"Taverne Sur Le Square is my uncle's favorite restaurant in Montreal. He lives there, I live in Columbus, OH, but on every visit up there, we stop by the Taverne at least once.I've been twice. Once in 2009, once in July of this year. When I went in 2009, I had a fish special - halibut over a cold cucumber/tomato salad with an incredible vinaigrette of some kind. Growing up, I always hated fish, and this was the first time I tried fish as an adult with an open mind, thinking maybe I'd like it now. That was a mistake. This dish was so incredible I generally don't like fish, because no where is the food so good as this halibut was.I returned this summer with high expectations. Sitting down and looking at the menu, I was worried - the menu wasn't very exciting, I didn't feel myself pulled into any of the dishes. Again, I got the fish special - red snapper (I think) over a bean ratatouille. Once again, the dish was fantastic. The flavors and textures all went together incredibly. I was very pleased.The restaurant itself is very nice, and the waitstaff very friendly. One man stopped by and talked to my uncle - I thought he might have been a friend of my uncle's, but it turned out he was just a very friendly server with an excellent memory! Overall a very pleasant experience. I look forward to returning on my next trip to Montreal."
