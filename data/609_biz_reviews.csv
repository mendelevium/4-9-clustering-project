/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Came to visit Montreal last year with some of my friends. Having heard about the amazing asian food in Montreal, I definitely had to look for a decent Pho place. Thanks to the amazing reviews on yelp, we were able to find this place. We got there slightly before the dinner rush so were seated fairly quickly. The menu had a good amount of selections of authentic vietnamese food. I had to try their pho but my friend got a noodle dish. The wait time wasnt too bad for fresh food. My pho was steaming hot when it came out so that made it even better for how hungry I was. The pho itself had a rich delicious broth. The meat pieces were large and I was happy with my portion sizes. The spice level was just right and I definitely enjoyed devouring my meal. My friend seemed to enjoy his dish as well. I would definitely recommend coming and trying the food!"
/user_details?userid=eCy43X201JNHYKbPDN8xpA,Hoyman L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"We walked all day long around Old Montreal, Old Port and Chinatown area and just wanted something that was nice warm and comforting. We heard that Montreal had a really good Viet scene and decided to check this hole in the wall place out. Like most reviews, don't expect much in the way of service here. But the food was actually quite good. We ordered the standard Large Special Pho, which is #5 on the menu. The bowl was quite large. It filled me up pretty good. Coming from NYC where we can get very good Pho this place is pretty much neck and neck with some of the good ones in NYC. The meat was sufficiently portioned for a large bowl. You get the raw beef round and also the cooked beef brisket that has some fat and nice flavor. They also give plenty of garnish to go with it all including scallions, cilantro, Thai basil, bean sprouts, lemon and even a chili pepper (be careful with the pepper).But what makes a Pho good is also the broth. This one was very meaty in flavor and savory at just the right amount. The noodles were cooked right and aldente. The broth could have been a bit more hot in my opinion. But other than that it was a winner in my book. Hit all the right notes and was warm and comforting for someone with tired legs in chilly weather.Another plus while we were there was a bunch of Vietnamese people eating there and really eenjoying the food. If their own people eat there, that's a really good sign.I wouldn't mind going back to try their spring rolls, summer rolls and other family style plates as well.All in all a good meal and reasonably priced. Walked out full and satisfied, the two of us, for just $24 (with tip included)."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"We needed some food after a few hours of drinking so we headed over to Chinatown. I wanted pho and found one of the few places still open, Pho Bac 97. It's located a few doors down from Nouilles de Lan Zhou. We dropped in on a Thursday evening (around 9:30pm). The place got a crazy last minute rush then died off again.The menu is split into appetizers, pho, rice vermicelli, rice (grilled and sautéed), combos and dessert. For the pho, you choose between three sizes (small, medium and XL). - Goi cuon (#1) ($4.50) - shrimp and vegetable spring rolls. It would have been decent except they used cheap quality, shredded lettuce that tasted off. - Bun bo xao sa (hoac ga) (#24) ($11.50) - beef sautéed with lemongrass on vermicelli and salad. Looked pretty typical but CC enjoyed it. - Com ga nuong (#26) ($13.00) - grilled chicken, rice and salad. Cbear didn't touch the salad but I don't blame her. Grilled chicken and rice looked plain.- Bun bo hue (#16) ($10.50 medium) - the broth was incredibly salty. 100% MSG. Not much depth or spiciness to their BBH. Super disappointing.Too many better places in Chinatown to waste a meal here."
/user_details?userid=nQ3S2QXLi8hMEEZVa1gn9A,Sansan H.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,This place is just alright. Pho Lien is so much better. We tried the cia gio and it was not good. We ordered pho no 5 and 7 - small size and we could not finish it. They gave us so much noodle and meat. Their rice dish is good. We ordered grill pork with fried egg. I think the rice dish is better than their pho
/user_details?userid=nFiKRBZ4zuqn-McjAThx2g,Jill N.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"It was a chilly spring day in Montreal, and I really wanted some Pho. Being from Hanoi, I am particular about my broth, and prefer a clean-tasting and clear-looking broth. I ordered a pho tai, and gleefully exchanged some Vietnamese with the waiter. The broth was GOOD! You could see that the beef slices were raw and cooked in boiling pho broth, which is how it should be. The only disappointment is the noodles, which were dry packaged noodles and not freshly made. This place is a gem in Montreal - when they find a fresh pho noodles source it will be a 5-star experience right away!"
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",3 star rating,"This pho hit the spot. Located in the center of Chinatown, it's a cheap little Vietnamese restaurant that offers pho and other Vietnamese dishes that you can find at other Vietnamese restaurants. Nothing fancy, fluorescent lights and kind of a bare bones service. We were seated right away and brought lovely jasmine tea like the kind that is served at Chinese restaurants. After looking over the menu, a man came by to take our orders without writing anything down. I ordered a medium pho, which ended up being a dollar cheaper than the small, but too much food for me to finish.I also ordered a spring roll, which here, means the unfried rice paper roll filled with bean spouts, vermicelli noodles, the white parts of lettuce and shrimp. The peanut sauce that it was served with was good, but I've had better rolls. Oh and by the way, they're called ""summer rolls"" where I'm from if you're more familiar with that term. I asked a waiter (?) for water and he didn't even acknowledge me, but another man brought us waters.... we had to go up to the cash register to pay. If the service was better, this place would be better than a-ok, but for now, it's just 3 stars in my book."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was at this restaurant a few years ago for their pho soup and decided to go back since I was craving a good pho. I attempted to  be adventurous and try a different dish based on the image #1 posted on yelp which for sure was photoshopped and didn't exactly represent the dish.I ordered #25 which is a beef vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and some lettuce and it came with a small soup as well. My friend ordered the same thing as I did but the chicken version. We were both happy with the soup but disappointed with the beef and chicken vermicelli bowl. It lacked color, taste and maybe the fact that I had a better version of this dish elsewhere makes me a tougher critique. Long story short they make a delicious beef pho soup and in my opinion this would be the best item on the menu to order. Stay away from their vermicelli bowl."
/user_details?userid=nLEgHtw5McyihUcomGebcw,Joanna Y.,"Cambridge, MA",1 star rating,"This is probably my worst pho experience to date.There was minimal waiting for a table but it took an easy 30 minutes for them to serve us water and take our order.My boyfriend and I came with high expectations given the great reviews. The portions are large so you do get a lot for what you're paying.It took a while for them to get my order right (we wanted a combo but wanted to upsize  the pho to XL, but that's a no apparently).We're coming from NYC so we're very use to terrible Asian service with the BEST flavor. But when it came it was just... average. It wasn't really memorable experience and we ate it all because we were hungry (coming off a 6+ hour drive)."

But I do have my favorite Pho place across the street so it makes it hard to try it here. I have had their bowls on more than one occasion I I really like it. The staff is fast and efficient. The location not amazing but typical Chinatown digs. Overall rating is based on the consistency of the food taste and quality. I stay go forward without concern. Enjoy!"

Took my boyfriend here last night; he's been a long time lover of pho but this was his first time at Pho Bac. This has been my favourite pho spot for years, but seeing my boyfriends reaction after being slightly skeptical or trying a new place affirms everything for me. Pho Bac is the number one place for an all around essential pho. I ordered a small #15 for reference in the pictures, and you can top as much hoisin and sriracha to your liking :)Service is always fast and friendly. The owner is a very sweet man who's always happy to see me, alone or with a group!"

/user_details?userid=7Vrhq8d87KYxy0VcQjRVXQ,Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",4 star rating,"After arriving in Montreal on one of the coldest days of 2017, driving through some harrowing traffic at rush hour, and discovering that our hotel was literally around the corner from Chinatown - my friend and I were thoroughly excited to go get some Pho!  Based on the reviews on Yelp, I decided on Pho Bac because it was very close, had great reviews, and looked exactly like that hole-in-the-wall place that serves authentic fare without all the pretension.And that's exactly what we got!  The perfect recipe for pho on a Friday night in Montreal.We arrived just before 8, and the place was hopping.  I was afraid we wouldn't get a table, but a group cleared out just as we arrived, and we were able to get a table.  It was crowded... but it made for a great atmosphere.  I would venture to say that a lot of the customers were locals.  I ordered Pho Ga as per my usual routine when at a Vietnamese place, and my friend ordered the vegetarian small soup.  She also ordered some fresh spring rolls.  Tea was complimentary.My pho was the best chicken pho I'd ever tasted.  I'm being completely honest with this when I say the best.  The cuts of chicken were good.  A mix of mostly white meat and some dark pieces.  The meat wasn't overly fatty, but you could tell that the broth had been cooked with just enough fat to give it a distinct flavor without being greasy.  I loved it.  The mix of vegetables was minimal, some onion a spring of cilantro.... with the sprouts and thai basil and lime wedge, the flavor was perfect.  The temperature, too, was excellent.  Hot, but not too hot that I couldn't dig in right away. I ordered a medium and it was plenty big, my friend's small was probably the perfect portion size to be honest. Service was swift and polite. The food was great. Atmosphere was authentic. Highly recommended!"

Anyway, we order one Pho one Bun Bo. Pho is ok,  Bun Bo is surprisingly strong taste with shrimp paste. My man like it and I saw next table 3 Caucasian dudes seem to enjoy it too. One hightlight of the food here is how tender the meat in both dishes is. Super tender, great taste. Clean spot and funny staffs"
/user_details?userid=qdU1O2_ERYJlk6zAlR5kkw,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This place blows NYC Vietnamese food out of the water. Why pho can't have a renaissance here like ramen did I'll never know.Came here on a Sunday morning for a noodle breakfast. Planned on ordering pho, but decided to switch to bun bo hue at the last minute. I like to live life on the edge, what can I say? Soup was fantastically spicy and flavorful, noodles were on point (none of that rice noodle BS), and there was plenty of beef. I'm pretty sure the waitstaff was talking about me, but I was in soup noodle bliss and just couldn't bring myself to care. Now bring this to New York and I'll be a happy camper...Until next time, Montreal."

/user_details?userid=qPkEqV3_FboD-IqPoxBYPQ,Rose J.,"Northwest Calgary, Calgary, Canada",2 star rating,After wondering around Chinatown we decided to grab a quick Vietnamese food. We decided to try pho bac. Only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because their service was fast.I have to say it was the worst Vietnamese food I had in my entire life!!! We both ordered beef vermicellibowl. The serving was small and the beef was so tough that we could not chew and had to spit it out. It was the most disappointing meal!!!!

It was good - the tendon. I thought the broth was average. It lacked the flavours that I'm used to back at home, but still enjoyed it.I'd come here if you want something quick to eat because service was relatively fast!"
/user_details?userid=r847wrNI8QGzNovUCSSktw,Nick W.,"Pasadena, MD",3 star rating,We got a medium and large bowl of pho vegearian and some shrimp and veggie roles. The pho was good but lacked that punch of uniqueness one often search for when out and about on an adventure. If you have pho at home then this is a great way to assure your spending your money for a dependable experience. If your on the adventurous side then you might be a tad disappointed!
/user_details?userid=JkfPViOd3kxMw3JpOH9gsg,Ellie B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A cheap and quick place to eat in Chinatown! It definitely doesn't have a fancy restaurant ambience but there are families, people eating alone,etc.I had #5 on the menu, which was a beef/tendon/tripe pho. It came really quick and was pretty good. I wouldn't be craving their pho all the time but if you are looking for a cheap giant bowl of pho, this is the place."
/user_details?userid=20xtru4h_7TjFn4lSHmSsg,Maia E.,"Burlington, Canada",3 star rating,We came to Pho Bac 97 for a snack before dinner. We ended up ordering the bun bo hue. The original bun bo hue comes with pigs blood and pig feet. I opted out of that and only got rare beef. Usually the soup comes steaming hot and the rare beef gets cooked. In this case the soup was luke warm so basically my beef was rare the entire time. I was lucky I didn't get sick after eating that.  Even my noodle was supposed to be milk noodles but was given pho noodles!  Other than the temperature of the soup it was flavourful with a hint of shrimp flavour. It was pretty tasty. The restaurant was quite dirty with sticky floors. They didn't have any of the milk shake like all the typical Vietnamese restaurants would have. All in all ok but would not come back.

It is so gooooood! All meats are bbq just right. The beef for the pho is tender. I would come here again and again when I am in Montreal. Gem of Chinatown and the Vietnamese community.

If you're a fan of beef pho, you'll like this place. The broth is really great on its own. I've been to other pho places where the soup broth was tasteless and had to had tons of hot sauce to enhance the taste, but this place does it right. Also a fan of their fried springrolls. I've tried their rice paper rolls and weren't that impressed, so I would stick to the fried ones if you like those. Reasonably priced and fast service. Giving this place 4 stars!"
/user_details?userid=KvjjKP8F2E0VvOP-pu6NkA,Julian G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"I'm Vietnamese and this is the best pho I've had in the western hemisphere, besides grandma's. This is not hyperbole. This pho is insanely delicious and I'm not just saying that because I came in from the cold craving soup.The flavors are subtle and abundant. The tai meat is lean and the brisket is fatty, just like I like it. Ordered the extra large, and dear God is it big.Also, loved the tea touch when I sat down. The new school pho places don't do that anymore. This place is legit. I will always come back here when I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I eat a lot of pho, especially from toronto, so I came with high expectations according to reviews. Large portions, and cash only.Got the first item on the menu, which was the mixed beef noodle. Meat was drab with no flavour. Didn't really taste fresh so I don't recommend the rare beef noodle. Broth wasn't extremely hot so I don't know if it all cooked down. The tripe was kinda meh as well. Good points though: Broth was authentic, and noodle texture was also on point.Usually I get vermicelli at pho places so I might go again and try that? Vermicelli usually comes fully cooked and warm/cold so you don't have to worry about the issues found in the pho here.Verdict: not a bad choice when you're craving pho but quality has lots of room for improvement."

I opted for the beef, tendons pho, there was an extremely generous portion of meat. The only downside was that the service took a bit longer than expected, but I can maybe attribute it to the busy-ness of the restaurant at that time."

This time I decided to try the regular assorted beef pho to compare with Bang. It turned out I liked this one better. First of all, the beef are very fresh. The one I get at Bang have some weird smells for the few times I went, their quality seems declined. At pho Bac, the broth is less greasier and I didn't feel thirsty after the meal. They probably used none or less msg. Speaking of the portion for an XL soup you pay only 11$ and they gave lots meat which is a bargain.

/user_details?userid=KE-v49suIeXR9F-2RGwSfg,Irene Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"After hearing that Canada has a huge population of Vietnamese, the Vietnamese food must be amazing. I have had pho from many Viet restaurants, and somehow there is no clear distinction on what okay or great pho is since it all basically tastes the same. The only distinction would be the soup base. The soup base is very clear and refreshing, which I really liked. I am very used to pho that has full of flavor and it makes me thirsty after every few bites. - If you really enjoy your soup base to be very clear with just enough flavor, this is the place to go. It was not salty at all, compared to many other pho places I have had especially in NYC. The spring roll definitely differs from the ones in NYC, I'm not sure whether it is just the way this restaurant or Montreal Vietnamese restaurant makes it, but it simply tastes the same but with larger spring roll wrap. One downside is the ice coffee that I ordered was packed with ice and it was completely gone after a few sips. It is definitely disappointing when I can't even enjoy my meal with my coffee. I can totally see everybody that works there are very kind people despite the low attentive service."

/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Sometimes you're just in need of fresh shrimp spring rolls with crushed peanuts on top of slightly sweet peanut dipping sauce. If you happen to be offered a pot of fragrant tea and a menu you may even order a bunch more. Since it was between meals, it was just the former 2.Unfortunately, the rolls were below expectations and I've had my fair share of 4 and 5 star semi translucent wrapped Vietnamese spring rolls of the freshest kind. Sometimes the green onion is sticking out the end, sometimes they are thicker and more chock full of plump bean sprouts and the shrimp are moist and flavourful. In this case the bean sprouts were brown at the ends, the roll was shriveled and dry looking, plus sadly the shrimp were dry and had not been cleaned properly. Perhaps, it was between lunch and dinner and they had sat a while. Perhaps, I was too focused on them as my main snack, yet something said, 'nope, this ain't right'. I expressed these shortcomings, (did not mention the place smelling not so good), and was told that was normal. I mentioned my numerous other good experiences and decided to move right along.I can see the average rating for this place is pretty decent, so I wonder if it was bad timing? I don't give many 2's, but for the spring rolls and smell under the table, this simply reflects that."

The broth is tastier than other places, with the right amount of fat and not overly sweet or salty like many other places do. The noodles are generally the right amount of cookedness and consistency, and the meat is always fairly high quality."

It is also spicy to my liking. The regular bowl is fairly large but if have a hefty appetite, the large will keep you full for a day! Definitely recommend this place!"

/user_details?userid=0g-inl2pJsJ5QXkR_SrHrg,Isa L.,"Salem, MA",1 star rating,"Previous reviews of vegan/vegetarian pho are mistaken. The chef uses chicken broth in their vegetable pho. There is a vegetable crispy noodle stir fry on the menu but unfortunately the noodles are prepared with eggs in them. My server offered to give me vermicelli instead, but when my dish arrived, the rice noodles were not integrated into the dish. Instead they were served in a cold lump in a separate bowl. The only truly vegan item on the menu is a vegetable spring roll. It lacked tofu, had poor quality iceberg lettuce and was accompanied by a dipping sauce that was largely vinegar with some floating peanuts on top. Very disappointing meal. Vegetarians and vegans beware."

I think it's #5 if I'm not mistaken).The vermicelli roll was really good I only wish they cut in half, but other than that very tasty. As for the pho it was blissful! It was raining that day so it tasted even better in the cold rainy weather. The broth was rich, the noodles were tasty and the amount of meat in it was more than enough.

Being from DC, I have quite a pho palate and this place fails miserably. Let's start off with the good:- the place has quick service.  You are in an out within 30 minutes. - the portions are large.  A medium size bowl is a large in some other places.  Now onto the disappointment:- cash only. It's expected in these types of restaurants but can be inconvenient for tourists. - the pho broth was greasy, a huge pet peeve of mine. The cuts of meat were also extremely fatty.  Some pieces were all fat.  Gross.  - the broth was also very bland. I had to add a ton of hoisin and sriracha in order to get any type of flavor.  - the summer rolls are bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, and slices of thin shrimp. The dipping sauce was watery.  Overall I would not come back.  Pho is all about broth and a greasy, fatty, unflavored broth is a big no no."

It tasted like most of the vietnamese restaurants I've tried. There was a hand full of Vietnamese restaurants but this was the best option. This place got selected since it was the only one I notice that had customers eating. The soup in the a separate container was filled all the way up which was not good for putting stuff in when you don't have a separate bowl. They put the noodle and raw meat in one container and the broth in another so they seem to be aware of the noodles getting soggy.

Third times a charm. After taking my first sip of my soup, ahhh, it hit the spot!  I was a little disappointed that I'd had whiffs of bleach even after the usual ritual wipe down of utensils. They also didn't have coriander. Cilantro and pho ga go together like salt on fries. It just gives it that extra umph. Nevertheless, the meat portions are generous and the soup is hearty.

The food is incredible, the staff is extremely nice, and the price is right.I always order combination B1, but with fresh shrimp spring rolls instead of imperial rolls (they are very accommodating here).  This combination includes strips of tender chicken sauteed with lemongrass and chili with sticky white rice, fresh shrimp spring rolls with two fantastic dipping sauces, and a spectacular Vietnamese beef and vermicelli soup.Every one of these things is out of this world.  The lemongrass chicken is tender, succulent, and just a tad bit spicy.  This is served with crisp veggies and perfectly cooked sticky white rice that provides a nice antidote to the spice.  The shrimp spring rolls are fresh, flavourful, and  paired with both a sweet vinegary sauce with carrots and cabbage and a homemade sweet and crunchy peanut sauce so crazy good you'll want to dip everything into it.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the beef soup ('Tonkinoise' in French) is perhaps the most delicious thing of all: a generous portion of incredibly tender, wonderfully flavorful beef strips floating in a jaw-dropping lemongrass broth with crisp green onions, soft vermicelli noodles and fresh cilantro.It isn't fancy, but Pho Bac is definitely worth making a special trip for."

We 4 people, ordered a big chicken pho, a big beef pho ( both were huge enough to share with 2 ) and a spring rolls ( not fried ). Spring rolls were just ok. Really, nothing special nor impressive, you can make them just like that at home. Pho was good, but weren't that hot as I wanted to be and I wanted them to have more flavor or salt even, I felt that soup was lack of salt or some taste even though it had a nice flavor. And also I wanted more chicken in a chicken pho, even though beef pho had a good amount of beef. So, to sum It up, I guess i'm not coming back.

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Utterly working-class eating house.  Was briskly greeted and presented with a pot of tea and a menu.  Menu is tiny.  Went with plain beef pho with extra veg.  Soup arrived quickly.  The flavor was *brilliant*.  The noodles in it had the best texture of any Asian soup noodles I've ever eaten.  Only complaint about the soup was the scarcity of beef.Choice of four sauces/condiments on the table, along with a rack of chopsticks and spoons, and an old school napkin-dispenser (wish more places would think of that), caused that I lacked for nothing logistics-wise.   Pleasant meal.Restroom was a bit dirty, but fully-functional. Points for that. You're lucky to get a door that locks, in a lot of Chinatown's places.This is a great place to quickly fuel up your gut with hot food that tastes wonderful.  Leave the Kiton blazer at home and just go in 501s and yesterday's grey hoodie.  And bring CASH.  That's all they'll take."

One downside about this place is that the least popular dishes/soups come out a bit lukewarm. I would recommend ordering something that is popular that way it comes out HOT! I'm surprised that the staff speaks four different languages! FOUR! French, English, Cantonese and Vietnamese! Amazing!In a tourist area this place was fast and cheap! I would come again if I were around the area!"

/user_details?userid=VNl-E0MjU6V6cVOMC43spQ,Meridith H.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"This is a solid, good place for pho. I really appreciate that they offer the dish in 3 sizes, even if the ""small"" isn't actually small. Most places give you a giant bowl of pho and call it good; here you are allowed to have some control over how much food you're requesting. I also really appreciate that the veggie pho was actually a star dish instead of regular pho without meat. Service was mostly efficient and mostly polite. When we were finishing up and getting ready to leave, our server was in the middle of condiment maintenance, and we had to interrupt him in order to get the check & pay. It's not a big deal, but be aware that you might have to flag somebody down at some point."

Otherwise good food but wouldn't go there again. Took 20 minutes to bring 3 bowls of pho. Not sure but every other vietnamese restaurant, the pho is the easiest and quickest and comes out in 5 minutes."

I do enjoy PHO and this was truly just average.my wife ordered the pork and shrimp and it contained only two shrimp. They only take cash. I ordered a spring roll and the waiter told me that they were out of them. 10 minutes later I saw them serving it to someone else. I won't be back.

/user_details?userid=Go006PCN18nVAAQ8fjHBiA,Jocelyn C.,"Somerville, MA",5 star rating,"Best pho of my life... and in the middle of Montreal, of all places. Who knew? We walked in on a cold afternoon to warm up and nurse some pretty bitchin' hangovers. The menu was the same as any other pho restaurant, order by number. They brought out the typical plate of basil, lime and bean sprouts as we sat there shivering and sweating simultaneously. I don't know what kind of liquid crack they put in their pho, but it was seriously, deliriously tasty and full of flavor! We licked those large bowls clean and wanted to beg for more, had we not already been so stuffed and satisfied. My boyfriend and I have had a lot of pho in our lifetimes, from many different places, but this place trumps them all. From the outside, this place looks a bit run down and beaten up. Don't let this fool you. Their pho just might save your life."
/user_details?userid=WN3RFolQCiVAvcqIpWhoNw,Jesse L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Self proclaimed Pho Enthusiast and this place would be my favourite for a downtown location. The pho here is definitely the best on the strip with good portion sizes. The spring rolls and imperial rills are also good- however I believe some of the other phos on the strip might be a little better in that regard. Also, the bun bo hue here is satisfactory but nothing I would order again ( something Montreal pho is lacking) . Anyhow, for Pho this is the spot you want to be at on Saint Laurent and within the dowtown, old port, chinatown, even plateau area for that matter... Once you head toward the mile end there are a few that can rival Pho Bac."
/user_details?userid=u9aAqhOiWIw146Qtp8RW6g,Annie P.,"Cambridge, MA",3 star rating,"Although I 100% trust Joke's tastebuds ..if you've had Prince Street, Flushing Pho Bac or Pho Bang in Emhurst.. Pho Bac 97 isn't as good in flavors or clean. Not to be a snotty brat but it only made sense that when us three Queens girls treck it over here to Montreal's Chinatown but only from St. Denis (no biggie) to try this place (all over the tour books) we weren't too impressed.I believe the Sriracha and Fish sauce were in containers too... so no squirt bottle action.  The decor made me feel like I was in a sad hardworking Alaskan family's restaurant. I can't imagine it in the Summer.None of us got the vermicelli or rice plates but the only way I could explain it is that if those other spots I mentioned boiled their broth for 5+ hours then this place only did 2... So if you're far from this location .. I'm pretty sure any other Vietnamese place around town will be the same.The servers were all friendly gangster men and one of the main guys even gave us his card in case we wanted to go to any ""asian parties"".. I believe his name was Chino or something close."
/user_details?userid=ufdOeIvigrtJInAB_kAXgw,Vanessa M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,This is a diamond in the rough! We did a quick search of the best food along the main Chinatown strip and Pho Bang New York popped up. That place wasn't satisfying enough so we did a quick search again and found Pho Bac! The food was great! No skimming on portions and friendly staff. Everything was quick and pleasant. We're going back just because of how wonderful of an experience it was. I definitely recommend this place and it's cheaper than Pho Bang and right across the street! Cross the street and have much better food!

The place is not that clean to be frank, definitely clean your utensils, cups, etc. its also relatively small, around 15 tables? I actually like this place the most out of all pho places I've been to. I only ordered the rice dish which was really good, but the pho judging from what other people said at my table, the pho is good as well. Overall the food is great, just the place isn't as nice."
/user_details?userid=HBPu9KJ4gnzBpZXZTrcZYA,Sarah R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing. I've had pho like it's meant to be, according to my Vietnamese friend, in California, and this is just as good, at least to my tastebuds. I've looked for a place like this in New York, and I don't think there is one. My father had never had pho before, and he said he has a new favorite food.The place even looks like it's supposed to, sort of cafeteria-style, almost. Portions are generous, and the price is pretty reasonable. Less than $10 for a bowl, several sizes available.I had the chicken, and my father had the beef, and they were both great. We also tried the shrimp spring rolls (not the fried kind, the kind that's often called ""summer rolls"") and they were great as well. They used iceberg lettuce though, and it was a little wilted.It's very casual. The tables have numbers, there are stacks of chopsticks and spoons on the table, and you pay at the front."
/user_details?userid=QAX9PI0-cAJN6x7rrR1Fbw,Andrew C.,"Daly City, CA",2 star rating,"This place was blah. This is the problem when you don't do any advanced research on restaurants before you go to a destination. Plus, when you ask people on the street for pho and they aren't Asian, they automatically send you to the local Chinatown. Oh well, lesson learnt. I looked up this place on the Yelp app on the crackberry. It came up and it looked okay. I actually was intrigued by Annie P.'s review on this place about the Asian party. We were hoping that the Asian gangster would give us four Asian brethren ideas on where the fun places were to go. But that didn't happen. Obviously the kind of party they were offering Annie P. isn't the kind of party we're invited to. The place is like any other standard Pho place. All of them have the standard white lacquer table and dinner chairs with the plasticy chopsticks and spoons sitting at the table. Ordered the Pho Dac Biet; the usual I get at any pho restaurant. The food came fast...standard. The soup was frickin hot, but unfortunately I can't say that the flavor was anything worthwhile. Was a little disappointed. We were craving some good pho after a few days of the gnarly rubbish the locals called food. We were hoping for an Asian saving grace in some local pho, but no joy. Well, it was filling and standard in price like $6 USD. It is in the heart of Chinatown (given that their Chinatown is like 2 square blocks). And of course China and Vietnam are the same.... right..... There were a couple places across the street that looked to be more popular by number of people in them, but they were all Caucasian with a couple Asians, so not sure if they were any good. My suggestion is to just find the one with the most or best looking Asian people and eat there. That way you'll at least get the pleasure of being with others with a similar taste profile and can maybe get that hookup to a nice Asian party in the area."
