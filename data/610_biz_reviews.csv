/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came with a group of 4 on Sunday around 8pm. We had reserved in advance, but it was unnecessary since it wasn't busy at all. Pros: - Very good food. It reminded me of my family's home cooking and it was very comforting after a long time without classic Chinese food. - the tea was refilled frequently- They bring out oranges and fortune cookies at the end. It's nothing crazy, but I'm always happy when I get fortune cookies. - A lot of items on the menu (see cons) - Food came quicklyCons: - Service wasn't particularly friendly, but it was okay- The decor isn't great- On the second floor, so not accessible by wheelchair (I think) - There are so many items that it can be really overwhelming for people if you have no idea what you're doing.TL;DR I think the quality of the food greatly outweigh the ok service, but if you've never had Chinese food before, do some prep and know what you want!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent canto food and super fast service. Garlic razor clams are definitely one of my fave dishes. Their other dishes are pretty flavorful and delicious as well. Just like any other typical canto restaurant, the service is super fast and the waiters aren't the nicest. However, it's efficient and that's the most important. They're always open until late at night which is great when everything else is closed."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's great to discover a new lunch spot (that really isn't new). I was invited last minute for lunch at this upstairs and non-descript Cantonese restaurant. I'll throw in 'old school' for good measure, because it had many round white cloth covered tables spread across a one room dining area with the cash right by the entrance to the stairwell, and then add a ceramic pot of Chinese tea to the visual.Now for the tasty part; the laminated full-page of lunch specials that runs from 11:30am to 3:30pm (I believe weekdays for $9 even before taxes and service). Most of the dishes looked interesting, but I went with the (semi) spicy salt & pepper; lightly battered and fried pork chops with diced onions and green peppers (I revisited the tastes and recall garlic as well), a pile of steamed white rice on the side, over baby Bok Choy. It was well and highly recommended size wise left enough for a lighter snack later on.More yummy news, all the meals are served with either Won Ton soup (with shrimp filled won tons) or hot and sour which I opted for and was up there with the better I've had; not too goopy and even keel flavor.Each gets one spring roll which was on the moister less crunchy side but substantial enough, and the standout of the lunch was the mini squirt bottle of orangy-yellow dipping sauce which tasted like liquefied Marmalade; very citrusy and memorable as far as sauces go.In sum, a solid lunch find and easy to tell why many are repeat diners."

This time we were 8, showed up without reservation on a sunday evening and the place was (is always) packed. The hostess first refused us but then one of the waiters patented a table out of 2 smaller ones putting a wheel on top. Boom! It's loud, it's chaos. It's your typical Chinese restaurant, so if you are an introvert, take your food to go.We had quite a feast with bbq duck, spicy squid, salt & pepper fried tofu, giant cooked oysters in black beans, beef broccoli, chicken in clay pot, a couple dishes of noodles, I can't even remember anymore LOL!!!! Everything was good. My favs are the oysters, tofu and squid. I would come back, hell, ive been back many many times!"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Yesterday we four people were there for dinner. We had reservation at 4:30pm. My friend arrived at 4:45. We were told we better to order dishes before 5pm or the chef will have dinner and the dishes will come out 30 mins late than average. We need time to read menu and than finalize order at 5:06 pm. The lady gave us some attitude, making us feel we uncomfortable. We tried our best to decide the order fast, and we didn't rush them or ask the chef not taking his break. Why they doing so?The dishes were ok. Complimentary soup and orange. We had a pot of lamb, deep fried oyster, fried long bean and pork. I saw many people order the pot. It came with some vegetable after you finished the meat you can boil the vegetable. This one was 28$, but taste good. The other dishes were not as good as other places I usually go, probably because the taste was too mild. I bet their seafood is very good and reasonably priced. However, for my usual dinner routine, I prefer some other places in Chinatown."
/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I and a group of friends ended up in Chinatown looking for a place to have supper. Luckily one of us  is originally from Beijing and knew this restaurant well so recommended it to us. ..kind of reluctantly because it was his favourite and likely because it was genuinely Chinese and not ""Canadian Chjnese""  that would otherwise appeal to a Québécois pallet. Hum.. I'm so glad I know him lol!This place turned out to be great. In the end 3 other friends joined making it 8 of us. 4 including me shared different plates. One is fussy and only likes chicken and the other three who came late only ordered starters. The service varied. My Chinese friend ordered for us in Chinese.. the waitress was friendly and helpful speaking a little English to the rest of us. We were a mix of English, French and Chinese. The waiter though who also served us was a bit surly and seemed annoyed at our three late guests and he having to take any additional orders. He wasn't so good. Oh, just note they forgot one our dishes in the end but apparently we didn't notice until after we finished as we were enjoying everything else. The decor.. large room on second floor.. other that giant menu options in Chinese on the wall there wasn't anything special about it. Albeit we were in Chinatown but were among the few non Asians in the room so a good sign the food is authentic. We happen to be seated at a giant round table which made it harder if not impossible to talk to people on the other side although again we were the exception as most others were at traditional tables. Now the food.. pretty awesome. My Beijing friend of corse ordered for us with nice compromising choices. It's hard to get 4 people to agree on everything. A nice pork broth soup came as the soup of the day. The meat and bone remained in the large serving bowl from which the waitress dished out into small bowls for us, was a perfect start. Pork, shrimp and chicken were among our groups main choices. The shrimp and snow peas were delicious. Shells were removed and I rediscovered snow peas all over again. The pork chops were breaded and greasy and tasty. Most came without the bone. My chicken loving friend ordered lemon chicken and a General Tao (which I always thought was a North American creation) both of which were tasty too. We had salty fish rice with it that which was surprisingly delicious. The veggies plate we ordered was forgotten. So, I'd recommend this restaurant. All of us liked everything we ate. In the end among us 4 our bill came to $28 each. I didn't have a drink and I can't recall now if the others did.. I'm going to say they didn't. Desert was a standard Chinese fortune cookie and Green tea was available all throughout the meal... apparently according to my fortune someone among us finds me cute lol. I'll take it"

/user_details?userid=0Zswwlz4NzUJoG-skyWzIw,Tania L.,"Mississauga, Canada",2 star rating,"We've been here a couple times during our escapades to Montreal, and I swear the quality deteriorates with every visit. We were choosing between the Lanzhou hand pulled noodles around the corner and this shop, and I do regret that we ultimately selected Keung Kee.Since the prices are quite steep, we opted for the set meals. The soup came out first, and the clear broth with the essence of the fatty pork meat and bone really hit the spot. The other dishes eventually came out one by one, and we were also given a huge portion of rice served in a bowl on the side.Salted Chicken (steamed):This chicken was okay. It wasn't particularly smooth not moist; on the contrary, I found it slightly dry but also oily at the same time. Some parts were undoubtedly better marinated than the others, as I had a couple pieces practically unseasoned.Stir Fried Beef and Bok Choy:This was the only vegetable dish of the night, and it was pitiful. The entire thing was doused in oil and unbelievably greasy. It was evident that they used a lot of oil and cornstarch to make the sauce , and just poured the mess over some bok choy pieces.Sweet and Sour Pork:This was also very bad. The pieces of pork were heavily drenched in a thick batter, so every piece and bite was essentially 80% flour. I also tried two pieces of pineapple, and had to spit it out each time. There was a strong stench associated with it, and it was evident that the fruit simply just wasn't fresh.Steamed Fish with Ginger and Scallions:This dish was a bit more palatable, with five large filets of halibut fish steamed. I still did find it on the oily side, but it was the best dish of the night.I vow to never come again."

We ordered Roasted squabs, Razor clams, Chinese broccoli, and Salted fish fried rice.The roasted squabs were very tasty. They kind of remind me of Pecking duck but they have less meat than duck. The razor clams, chinese broccoli and fried rice were also very yummy and they went very well with the roasted squabs."
/user_details?userid=VFLmf0iImwfN4YEKargcxg,Ray L.,"Honolulu, HI",2 star rating,"Yikes!  We were not expecting a huge block party in the museum area on a Friday night and there were thousands of people in the streets and overflowing into the restaurants so it was really hard to get a table anywhere in the vicinity.  Our walk towards the water reached Chinatown shortly and it was like the pick of the draw that we ended up in this place. This eatery is everything that you'd expect from a Chinese place with tight seating, loud chattering, less than pleasant service and plastic lined table cloths with a man serving the food with his sweaty white t-shirt rolled up at the sleeves and looked as though he was either the dishwasher or prep cook.   He did a great job bringing the food out and was courteous but I think they should at least get him a collared polo shirt if he is going to be out serving food to the patrons.  The three dishes we ordered was bland and comparable to a fast food Chinese joint.  We had the Chinese broccoli which was good but that would really be hard to mess up.  The other two dishes were braised tofu and orange peel beef.  The tofu was very dry and did not have enough sauce.  The orange beef was a clump of fried beef sauteed in some sweet and sour sauce.The only saving grace was that the $50 CAD price was only about $37 USD.Why did I get Chinese food in Montreal?  Cause it was 8pm and getting late!  SORRY FOLKS..but I guess I'm more accustomed to better Chinese cuisine even on an island like Hawaii."

/user_details?userid=3ef9du3AsQtCwK1Z_CuLpg,Howard H.,"Flushing, NY",3 star rating,"I feel like Keung Kee is trapped in time.  It has an enormous menu (about 260 items not including the secret ones on the wall in Chinese) that is split between the classic Cantonese fare and the westernized Chinese food of the 1960's and on.  It's right in the heart of Chinatown and when we got there, it was packed with locals rather than tourists.  The classic Canto fare was pretty good (snow pea shoots, crispy chicken, fish maw soup) but the westernized fare was not so great (tomato shrimp, fried rice, etc.).  Prices are reasonable and service is on par with your average Chinatown restaurant.  Place is also relatively clean which is a plus."

Surprisingly, I have never been to this place until one of my friends (who happens to not be cantonese) brought me to it. The restaurant is popular, especially with older asian people and families (with is always a good sign when going in a chinese restaurant). The wait are sometimes long, but on that day, we got lucky and we were seated right away at 9pm on a Saturday evening. We ordered Yeung Chow fried rice and a place of sall & pepper squid. The fried rice was well seasoned with mixed flavors and the squid was well fried and crispy with lots of flavor. Now that I discovered this place, I will definitely come back when I'll crave some comfort food."

While buying a king crab in Chinatown, a man suggested we come here because it is said that this place knows their seafood. WOW!!! It was out of this world!!! We got the fixed king crab and lobster meal. Prepared in many ways, our family had the best time savouring our food. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The good kept on coming and by the time the fish came out (the last dish) we were already in food coma mood! It was so good that my dad placed and order for the crab in four days lol! Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back!!!"
/user_details?userid=2RNmvMFZmy9mcy7pZ8Helw,Patrick Y.,"Brea, CA",5 star rating,I've lived in Singapore for about 30 years and love the Chinese cuisine there which is slightly different from that in Hongkong and certainly China itself. For the last 12 years I've lived in USA and can't find Chinese restaurants on par with those I've frequented in Singapore until I came to Montreal's Chinatown and Keung Kee! The steamed fish was done to perfection and also our favorite razor clam and Chinese broccoli. We were so happy with lunch that we reserved a table for dinner the same day and it was fortunate that we did because it was packed on a Friday. For dinner we had Beijing Duck. Unfortunately the skin came with more meat and was not as crispy as the ones in Singapore. It was more the Hongkong style. Still it was quite acceptable.
/user_details?userid=xIyhTKOtEUk9E4zAwrr-CA,Veronica S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"I went here twice. Once late night just to grab some shrimp wonton soup to go and then for my anniversary dinner, early evening. The soup was amazing. The broth was flavorful and the wontons were packed with shrimp. For our actual dinner I had the lobster, Cantonese style, while my husband had the Green Bass. We ordered 2 spring rolls, a side of white rice and pea leaves in garlic. Just thinking about this food is making my mouth water. They definitely do not skimp on the portions. The lobster was huge and meaty. The veggies were cooked to perfection, the spring rolls were fresh and crisp, and the rice was perfectly cooked. The pricing isn't bad either. All in all I definitely recommend giving Keung Kee a try even if you're doing take out. You won't regret it. The staff was very polite as well, which is always a bonus."

If you're expecting Michelin dining, you're not in the right place. If you want a pared down menu because you don't know how to make decisions, you're not in the right place. But if you want amazing food at fair price, Keung Kee is for you.Honestly, everything on the menu is fantastic. I usually don't know what anything is, but I try it anyway... haven't been disappointed yet. Key takeaways so far though: hot and sour soup, salt & pepper anything, the oyster mushrooms and... well, anything really. Just go, check out the menu and pick something that speaks to you. Chances are that you'll make the right choice."

The service is not the best by any measure but the food always satisfy my craving for Chinese seafood dishes. Some of their specialties are the duck stew, deep fried seafood and deep fried milk sticks. I don't know any other restaurant that makes deep fried milk sticks in Montreal, so I was super grateful that they make it. They are very tasty! Crispy on the outside, soft, tender and sweet in the inside. They are kind of like deep fried ice cream but better. I also like their salt and pepper seafood, deep fried as well. But this dish is so flavourful, the skin is coated with right amount of seasoning but the seafood inside still kept their freshness. They are a seafood restaurant so make sure you order lots of seafood!"
/user_details?userid=5zOxJs6aMyDGqnn1HmXgSg,Yolanda C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I'm from Hong Kong and have lived there almost all my life, and this is authentic - from the food to the unceremonious service. It's not exactly a hole in the wall place, since it has nice-ish decor (good for a sit down dinner), but the service is definitely very HK i.e. servers are kinda curt and food is plopped onto the table unceremoniously. Nothing appalling, just typical of service back home where efficiency is everything. It's worth it for the food though! Very authentic and surprisingly good, especially for the one seafood item we tried. There are seafood specials listed on signs around the dining area, mostly all in Chinese, but worth a try. Besides that, they also have lunch specials (11:30a-3p I think) that are a pretty good deal for around CAD5-8 per dish if you're looking for a quick lunch).We got:// oysters in garlic // REALLY good! Oysters are huge and tender, and the soy sauce / garlic hybrid that the oyster is cooked in is delicious (I poured the sauce onto some fried rice and devoured it). Seems like seafood is pretty decent here! // vegetables (tong choi) stir fried in fermented tofu //Miss these vegetables dearly - portions are generous and it is prepared in the typical way, with the leafy bits soaking up the sauce and the thin stalks providing a bit of a crunch. The fermented tofu is salty and delicious, but may be an adventurous choice if you're not used to it.// wonton noodles // I am quite picky about wonton noodles, but this is pretty solid. Noodles could have just a tiny bit more bite to it but the wonton itself is pretty good.// crispy noodles with meat //It has the crispy noodle base, and the tender noodles soaking up the sauce on the top part. // salted fish fried rice //Definitely pungent (without being stinky), but that's the way I like it - again very authentic and might not be for everybody, but it is pretty good."

From simple dishes such as fried rice, fried noodles, congee to more complex dishes such as Beijing peaking duck and roast chicken, everything exceeds my expectations every time! I heard many of the chefs are from Hong Kong hence they know the original recipes in making tasty Cantonese dishes. It could be very busy at times so plan ahead or make a reservation to avoid disappointment in waiting in line.They also cook home made desserts and after a big meal, if your stomach still have room - make sure you ask for the soup based Chinese desserts such as red bean soup or coconut saggo which is very yummy.I come at least one or two times a week for dinner.

People were actually waiting the staircase area to be seated. I told the (very busy) woman that I wanted takeout and she gave me a menu. I order a Chicken Fried Rice and General Tao Chicken and was told it would take about 15-20 minutes but that she would try to tush it. She was very nice, despite it being busy in there. (She was beyond multitasking) I walked around for a bit outside and got back in about 10-15 minutes and my food was ready!! I cashed out (cards accepted) and went back to the hotel.

Just like any other Chinese Restaurants, they often have dishes that are not available in English on the menu. But often these are the ones that I enjoy the most. The bottom line is, Keung Kee is a reliable Chinese restaurant with delicious Cantonese food, and a good selection of seafood options such as lobsters, scallops, and razor clams."

The restaurant featured disposable plastic tablecloths, mismatched chairs (some of them were folding) and tight spaces. Despite this, there was a line of guests that snaked down the stairs as guests settled in for a wait.We selected a number of dishes, which when served family style, highlighted our love of sweet and sour flavor combinations. We gorged ourselves on crunchy stir-fried shrimp and chopped onions in tomato sauce; tender, crispy fried pork with onions and peppers in a sweet and sour sauce (my fave); fried shrimp and chicken with mayonnaise; savory crispy-skin duck with a sweet hoisin sauce, and a slightly spicy General Tso's chicken. A complimentary pork/black bean broth-based soup was served at the start of the meal, and similar to many other Chinese restaurants, orange wedges were served at the end.With quick service and a hungry table, we were done quickly, freeing up the table for the other hungry guests."

We didn't like the shrimp on toast in the appetizers, however the chicken corn soup and the spring rolls were really good. The calamari was nicely prepared , spicy as it should be. The sweet and sour fried shrimp was good , oddly served ( shrimp apart from the sauce) , but we liked it as each put the sauce he like ( soya, spicy , sweet & sour) .   From the main dishes my favorites were the pepper sauce beef as well as the shrimp in lobster sauce. Other enjoyed the sesame chicken as well as the chicken with lemon. These dishes are perfect if you like sweet food. Chicken with black been was also good.

Decor is not fancy, good value."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Short and sweet review, or may be rather salty than sweet. Chinese restaurant on the main strip, second floor, absolutely worthy trying. Customer base consists predominantly of people who will appreciate the authenticity of the  food. The salt and pepper pork is amazing, don't hesitate about it. Nice choice is the salt and pepper toffu, which deserves to  be on the table along with the steamed green beans. Note I would not call the last two dishes vegetarian although they may sound like. We are still in search of the best fried rice in Montreal, meaning the fried rice is not compulsory in Keung Kee. The food we ordered was pretty salty, but the pot of hot tea that was refilled as needed helped me survive. I observed with envy the amazing seafood brought to the neighbouring table, a sign I will be back for seafood or salty, salty yummy pork."

Both were excellent. Their free daily soup was great too if you like traditional Chinese soup boiled with pork bones and other different daily ingredients. It was actually their good tasting soup and seafood that made us came back the next day for dinner again!Since they are only really busy during a short dinner period, they always tried to rush you out and turn over as many tables as possible to maximize their income. Nothing wrong with that if you are tourists like us that just want a good in-and-out meal quick. If you want to stay to chic chat, this is not the place for you. I mean we were served the complimentary small orange plate before we even finished our dinner plates and rice. As soon as we touched the orange plate, we were served the bill too followed up shortly by a waiter with a machine to get your credit card to pay :)."

To be fair, the price is good for the portion, but quality-wise it's really average. Heavy seasoning and difficult not to feel thirsty after each bite. The waiter always wants to push you to choose the expensive dishes (ex: seafood), which is really annoying. But if you have a limited budget and feel quite hungry, this place is indeed a good choice."

And the shrimps, beef and squid plates were excellent ! I liked them all !We were 10 and on saturday they found us a big table easily so it's a plus !The only thumb down is that the servers have a neutral face anytime, but as the service is fast and i only worry about the food it's ok. Also they don't speak french and just bit of english anyway just show them the menu and it's ok !   Si vous voulez un repas chinois authentique ( style Hong kong) et que vous ëtes tannés des buffet Americano-chinois ! C'est un excellent endroit ou manger à Montréal.C'est très abordable vous pouvez compter entre 10 et 14$ par plat. Habituellement  dans ce genre de restaurant tous le monde commande un plat différent, et on partage tous les plats afin que tous puissent goûter à la variétés de plats offert !Nous étions un groupe de 10 un samedi soir, et ils nous ont trouvés une grande table facilement ce qui est très bien !La seul point négatif est que les serveurs ne parlent pas français ( juste à leur montrer le menu !), et juste un peu l'anglais. Ils ont aussi un visage neutre à chaque fois qu'il vous servent. Vu que la qualité de la nourriture et la vitesse du service est ce qui m'importait vraiment c'était correct dans l'ensemble.À essayer !"

/user_details?userid=AStTppA8-jqhDxF2kajwaw,Rajendra Réjean K. C. B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent preserved (century) egg congee with a wonderful hint of ginger. Add a dash of soya sauce and some white pepper and you're good to go. We also had a very nice mushroom tofu marmite hotpot. That was the pinnacle of savoury shroomie goodness. There was an amazing garlic gai-lan (Chinese broccoli) steamed to perfection. I ordered an off-the-menu preserved egg with ginger which is just so incredibly delicious. For dessert there was zhà xiān nai (deep fried condensed milk custard) which was crispy and golden on the outside and creamy and silky and voluptuous on the inside. Everything was very very good. This place is open late and is on point. It his the spot. I love the delicious ambiance of the Quartier chinois just after midnight. It's got a lovely feel to it. Enjoy!

The menu is extensive and uptodate with the latest and freshest items in season. Quality is unmatched and service is fast.

The first time, the food was amazing and left us craving for more. We had duck soup, stir fried scallops and sesame beef. The soup and scallops were to die for. If only for that day, we would have given 5 stars, no doubt. However, the second time the food was good, but the salted and peppered seafood was way to salty and was battered (although no word of it in the menu). Except  of that, all other food was good. We also had scallops in satay sauce, two soups (shrimp wonton and beef, preferred the latter) and some chicken dishes. The prices are reasonable, you can choose small, medium or large size for soups and rice. They also have all kinds of other seafood. Would also return for the third time :)"

/user_details?userid=BSVThVjjFaF5orzkW7Of7Q,JB L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Restaurant Keung Kee is arguably the most authentic Hong Kong place in Montreal. Unfortunately, that's also why it's not the best place for people who are unfamiliar with that style of food and decor. I have lived in Hong Kong for 1/3 of my life, and Keung Kee reminds me of the typical restaurants there. The chef is able to reproduce a lot of the tastes and flavours I'm accustomed to eating in HK - often giving nostalgia a tickle. They also have a pretty decent selection of dishes there. The staff and decor are reminiscent of HK as well. The staff do not speak French, and, in fact, hardly speaks English at all. They are neither rude or friendly, which is typical of Asian restaurants. The decor, with its colours and oversized drapes, are very much like the ones you would find in HK.I wouldn't normally recommend this place to the average Joe. However, if you're feeling particular adventurous and are eager to try out a really authentic HK restaurant, then this place is for you."

/user_details?userid=D6nfRKxQeYJ9IyVQYomBzw,Alan A.,"Fremont, CA",1 star rating,"I would give restaurant a negative star rating if possible.  First of all, I ordered wonton noodle soup with  BBQ Pork.  When my order came, there were no noodles, and I was given a combination of ingredients instead of my BBQ Pork.  When I asked what happened to the noodles and BBQ pork only, the waiter said that the restaurant just ran out of noodles.  Okay you ran out noodles, but what happened to my preference for BBQ pork only? I think that the restaurant opened up at 11:30am.  My fiance and I were there at 12:00pm.  How can they run out of noodles within a half hour of opening???  Second, my fiance ordered sesame chicken with jelly fish for $12.95. The waitress tells my fiance that they are out of sesame chicken, but they can replace it with yellow chicken.  When we got the bill, there was an additional $5.00 tacked on for the yellow chicken.  The original dish was $12.95.  The new price for the chicken dish was $17.95.  When we asked what the price increase was for, we were told that the price went up because they replaced the dish with a different kind of chicken.  It would have been nice if they told us of the increase in price rather than assuming that everything would be okay.  It is the same with my wonton noodle soup.  They never told me of any changes.  They just brought out my dish.  This is so wrong!Five dollars isn't a whole lot of money.  It is just the principle that we were getting ripped off.  We complained about what they did.  After going back and forth for a little while, they finally corrected the bill.As for the food, the yellow chicken was very tough and not that tasty.  Where the wonton soup os concerned, the wonton tasted okay, but the soup base was kind of bland.We will not be returning back to this clip joint.   Be aware of their shady tactics if you decide to dine here."
