/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Mexican?? In Montreal?? I love that they advertised by having a guy shout TACOS at random intervals. The smells coming from this place on a cold Sunday afternoon were like a beacon beckoning us closer. Our friend recommended it anyways so we were glad to make the pit stop. We ended up getting their special 4 tacos for $10, and got 2 al pastor (pork), and 2 chorizo (spicy porc sausage). It was decent, with grilled pineapples in the al pastor that gave it a really nice flavor. Given that I've had LA tacos for the last 10 years, these for me were good, just not great. Mostly it was the construction of them that I felt let down by. Usually there's 2 tortillas to help support all that juice and fillings. With just one tortilla it ends up being a huge mess which is hard to them eat during covid when you find random street corners and parks to eat on the fly. Salsa was nice with good amounts of onions and cilantro (tho cilantro wasn't particularly fresh). A great sign of the times that Montreal is having some seriously good and traditional Mexican offerings!"
/user_details?userid=1NtBKCmdlPC48FsZtPiF6Q,F J.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Wanting some tacos, and pressed by friends to try this spot out - I finally gave this a shot. This place probably is better classed as a Tex-mex place. Pros:1. Flavours were there - chicken was tender and every bite was great Cons: 1. Minuscule portions. My 4 tortillas were overlapping with a scant portion of chicken on top. I was hungry after :( I would go back but maybe when they have better deals - just couldn't justify paying that price for what I got."

But again, we are in Montreal and we don't really have many other options when it comes to mexican food. So, worth a try?"
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It seems hard to find a good value Mexican restaurant in Montreal with most either being great but too expensive for what they are or on the cheaper side with the food clearly lacking. However, this place hits right in the middle!No frills here but they make up for it in flavour. The places looks very small from the outside but there's a lot of seating further inside so don't let that deter you! Their menu is great and has a lot of authentic dishes and drinks to choose from (barely any vegetarian options though, sorry). They will start you off with some complimentary chips and salsa to open up your appetite. Highly recommend the al pastor tacos I ordered, very juicy! The carne tacos were dressed and came with their own sides and seemed a little plain. Their Cubano sandwich was pretty good (and massive). Everything was very decently priced.So many options of the menu can't wait to come back and try some more."

We had pleasant and friendly service. So many choices. The mixed grill was a great way to introduce myself to their flavours. Very nice. Everything was fresh and tasty. They also have a market section for fresh or imported items. Gracias"
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",5 star rating,"A very cute place close to the Jean Talon market. Stumbled across this place with some friends and we were absolutely ravenous. So glad we stepped in! I don't usually usually go out for Mexican food often, especially since most places seem more like bastardized tamed versions of Mexican food, but the large menu outside intrigued me with its offerrings of lengua, nopales, and so much more. We were offered a trio of salsas and chips to start. The chips were fresh and crunchy, and the salsas were very flavorful. Careful though - one was fiery hot and had me coughing, so taste carefully or ask the waiter if you're unsure. Then again, I'm the type of gal who can't even eat jalapenos, so your mileage may vary. My two dining partners got veggie tacos and carnitas tacos. Each plate came with 4, and the veggie also came with salad, rice, beans, and guac, and looked like a lot more food. They proclaimed them to be delicious. The corn tortillas were very authentic as well. I was amazed by the diverse options, and was tempted by the menudo (tripe stew), the tacos cabeza (the special that day) or the tongue tacos, but went for the lamb enchiladas with verde sauce in the end. The lamb was so tender and pleasantly fatty without being cloying. It was absolutely delicious. The beans were a bit salty but were good when mixed with the rice. We also shared a pitcher of horchata. It was very good but very very sweet - I don't want to know how much sugar was in it, it was sweeter than bubble tea! It certainly was a treat though. There is a little store in the back selling all sorts of Mexican ingredients, like chiles, mole, their various salsas, cactus pads, tomatillos, and so much more. Service was good and the waiter was very patient with our antics (we had come in slightly tipsy). I'd definitely recommend this place!"

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,We stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday and the place was very busy and lively. They have lots of seating as well as a little grocery section that sells some Mexican items and take home tortilla. They bring complimentary chips and salsa to the table which is always fun. We came for the tacos I had the al pastor tacos and they were super tasty and it was a good sized portion (4tacos). I also tasted their steak taco but I didn't find it as good since the meat was a little dry. Their tamarind juice was really resfreshing and a few people had the horchata which they said was great too. Great place for a casual lunch or a quick bite for dinner. Pricing was super fair and affordable which is nice and service was friendly as well. we didn't get to try their churros this time around or their sweet rice dessert but they looked great. Looking forward to going back for more tacos and dessert !
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this cute place. They have one of the best guacamoles in town. Their ingredients are super fresh, perhaps it's because they are close to the market. The service is nice too, although on some hot summer days it can get a little bit busy so you may have to wait just a little bit. The food is definitely worth the wait!"

Just tacos and things. They also have a grocery section that you can pick up tortillas, guac, queso, etc.Although I've tasted other things there I always end up taking the menudo soup (tripes) and the lengua tacos (beef tongue) and they are always delicious.Honestly, just go."
/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Merited 4 stars. Kind and helpful servers.. quick to serve the food..fresh ingredients and fairly affordable too. Went here with my mama friends and our little babies of 6months. The front and back entrance are not stroller friendly but that didn't stop us from getting in. Ambiance is pretty basic and doesn't leave much to desire. It's also a grocery store which sells interesting hot sauces. I love that they serve nachos with 4 different types of salsa. We all loved our meals and were well taken care of. Would surely go back!

This place has a bit of a diner feel, very casual and has lots of seating. In the summer they also have a terrace on the market side. They make homemade tortilla chips and salsa's with various levels of spice. Their service is attentive, pleasant and efficient. They have an extensive menu of different items  including entrees, surf and turf, quesadilla burritos and tacos. Each meal is served with toritlla chips and salsa. For just $9 you get 4 tacos of excellent quality! We have tried their Al Pastor (a must!), Barbocoa (lamb), Carnita's (pork) and the veal tongue, which is very good! I  highly recommend ending your meal with churros! They are stuffed with dulche de lèche and were delicious!!"

It was good! Had 3 different salsa sauce provided with different levels of spicy! Good!Ordered the nachos supreme thinking its the typical nachos. We were wrong. It was a platter with rice, guacamole on the side and then nachos submerged in sauce and cheese, or should I say soup... the nachos underneath were all soggy, it was not good. The meet that came with the platter were chewy.Then ordered tacos. One order is 4 tacos and is 9$. Actually great price! I tried the porc and pineapple one, it was good. Also ordered the lamb one. This one was rather dry. Had to pour the whole salsa dip they gave us at the beginning... most not forget to menton how the tacos were served. It was literally 4 tortilla on the plate and then the topping just on too everywhere. How are we suppose to eat this without making a mess?"

I got the beef soup and the 'fish' buffer. Boo Boo got the chicken fajita thing. The taste was there but we've definitely had better. My fish taco were more veggie than fish. There was a lot of sauteed onions and carrots and a small morsel of fish in each tacos.The churros were stale. like its been sitting out for a few days. My expectations were not high so a 3 stars is fair. Its like eating at the subway next to the world trade center. American cc accepted. Tip your wait staff in cash.

Really enjoyed this place."

/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there on the weekend afternoon. The restaurant is spacious. There are two big rooms. The one with open kitchen can be a little noisy and full of smoky smell. I had a taco with the sliced meat and pineapple and my husband had a plate which I forgot the name. They both very tasty but still I drizzled some spicy sauce coming with the complimentary chips. The complimentary chips with three sauces I like the middle spicy one. The green one was too much to handle. There were homemade drinks, and I tasted all three (two floral ones and one rice water) and chose the sunflower one.Highly recommend to try the sauces and buy one home. Good value."

The waitress explained the heat level of the three salsas and then left us to look at the menus.We ordered 3 dishes and they were delivered very quickly.My husband had the beef tongue tacos and he thought they were very tender and delicious. He had to order some guacamole on the side as they needed something. He also used some of the salsa from the chips.Our son had the carne tacos which were also very good. He also needed to order some sour cream as they needed something.I had the pork sopes and they were great. They were served with rice, which was also good and guacamole which was made exactly the way I like it with lots of flavour and nice and chunky.If we lived in the area, we'd definitely return to El Rey Del Taco.

The resto itself is small and they do have an outdoor terrace which is great for summer!  The service is super-friendly and very welcoming. We tried the chicken and steak tacos which were very light and super tasty!  Loved every bite! Definately do leave room for dessert! Their churros were delicious and yummy!  A sweet-lovers dream come true !   We also tried their hibicus ice tea whch was unlike traditonal ice tea which is usually packed with sugar.Their tea was less sweet but super tasty and refreshing ...great sumnertime drink. I would definately recommend this place...great for a quick bite to eat or family supper. Great quality food and not expensive. They also sell latino products including tacos and sauces which is great!
/user_details?userid=_yZJn9ic5qXWfBHpS9BxPA,Paula F.,"Hicksville, NY",4 star rating,"While at the Marche Jean-Talon, my boyfriend and I we looked for a place to get dinner. After a 6/7 hour drive from NY for our vacation in Montréal, we wanted something relatively quick. We decided to try one of our favorite cuisines: Mexican. And we landed on El Rey del Taco. We ordered a gordita and two different types of tacos. Steak and pork tacos. How else can you tell if a Mexican place is good or not?The service was pretty fast after we sat down. It took them a few minutes to acknowledge our existence after we walked in though.The gordita tasted okay. I felt it was lacking a bit of flavor. It's a corn flour dough stuffed with chicken, cheese, cilantro, lettuce and topped off with mayo.The tacos were good. The steak tacos were a little over cooked to my liking. They came with with peppers, onions, cilantro, red salsa in corn tortillas with a side of lime. The pork tacos were delish, moist and tender, with some fat. The pork tacos came with onions, cilantro, red salsa in corn tortillas with a side of lime.This place also carried dessert which we didn't have since the meal filled us up. But looked really good.

/user_details?userid=DByGAySqphwydrKuk-lXFg,Romy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"As a Mexican customer, I have to say that this place is actually pretty authentic. The smell. The taste. The herbs. I'm pretty picky with the Mexican places I decide to visit and indulge in. I had the pozole with pork. It was delicious, slightly salty for my own personal taste but my companion liked it. The tacos we had were exquisite, authentic. We tried the steak and tongue tacos, the salsas were good. One was spicy as hell which was perfect! Mouth on fire is always a good sign when eating a salsa but with taste buds left to indulge in flavors. We had hibiscus water which was quite refreshing and I indulged in the hot chocolate which was pretty good minus the tongue burn from it being steaming hot. No worries, my taste buds made it out alive. I had their desserts, churros. That's probably the one thing I will say needs effort. Those churros have a thick and heavy dough which is not typical of churros. I appreciate the update with the filling however that may be the culprit as to why they seemed to have failed someone's recipe from the homeland. Moving onto those little cookies, they're actually new to me. Never heard of them, first time trying them. In my humble opinion, I loved them. Better than the churros by far! I would recommend anybody in search for Mexican food to stop here and grab a bite."
/user_details?userid=TM0MV0JtJbtDGLckfXWjoA,Elena P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I am very surprised with all the nice reviews about this place. One of the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been. The place is filthy, small and crowded. I almost thought to turn around and find something else in the area, but given all the good reviews about the food, decide to still give it a chance. It took at least 10-15 for someone to come and take our order and another 30 min for the food to arrive. The tacos were subpar. I had pork tacos and there was more fat than porc meat. My husband got chicken tacos and chicken was dry. However the cleanliness of the place was the biggest issue for me - If they cannot keep the dining area and washrooms clean, what state is the kitchen at then."

I also read that they make their horchata in-house; this was extremely watered down and had an off-taste to it; this was just sipped and pushed off to the side.

Luckily, I came across El Rey Del Taco and it was everything I wanted and more. They serve up traditional Mexican food at a low cost. I loved that they provided us with tortilla chips with 3 different types of salsa varying in heat (high, medium and light). Tacos are served on a soft tortilla which was nice compare to the hard shell you get at most places. I got the pork tortilla topped with pineapple and my boyfriend got the vegetarian plate. They have quite a few veggie options if you don't eat meat. The only disappointment were the churros. They were hard and tasted a bit stale, but even at that they weren't too bad.The place itself has a nice vibe; with beautiful Mexican photography on the wall. And colourful decor really lit up the place. They also have tons of speciality Mexican food products on display.The kitchen is semi open concept, therefore if you want you could watch the cooks prepare your food.

That's fine, there's a portal to Mexico at El Rey del Taco. When you walk into the restaurant you'll instinctively search your pockets for your Spanish phrase book but don't worry, you won't need it. I can tell that the staffs are quite friendly but they appeared to be all over the place during one of my visits. Must be because it was a holiday where El Rey del Taco was one of the few restaurants that was open. Props to them. Just like the time when I ate in Mexico, tortilla chips with various dipping sauce will be your bread and butter. How about the tacos? I'll tell you that it brought me right back to Mexico with that supple tortilla and that very Mexican cilantro, onion and lime trio. If you're a big eater then an order of taco wouldn't be enough, at least that's how it was for me. Or was that because I was hungry for more?"

If it's your first time going, you might be tempted to play it safe and go for the guacamole and/or tacos. Go for it. They're above and beyond amazing. But if you want to branch out, I recommend trying the tamale or their ""nopales"" appetizer. Or their tortilla soup. You know what, forget it, no matter what you get you're most likely going to leave happy. Seriously. Their location is pretty awesome, too. They're not too far away from Jean-Talon metro, and right in the Jean-Talon Market, so it's really easy to get to and really cool if you're down to eat on their terrasse.

Real Mexican waiters speaking Spanish with us, which brings the experience to a totally new level. The place and decorations are very simple, but who cares. The second you step your feet inside this places, the smell of the food will make you crave instantly.Price are fare and dishes are very well served. I don't recommend to share one order for two, in case you are very hungry. (I'm always VERY hungry). Usually I go for the chef's choice, but since I'll never be able to decide if I want beef, pork or chicken, I ask for a mix.  Totally worth trying.

We enjoyed the outdoor seating and when the food arrived he tried a couple bites and said it was too saucy. So I switched plates with him without even getting a bite myself. That's love. However, I really liked the enchiladas, the sauce was slightly spicy and the chicken was well seasoned. The refried beans were creamy, a good counter to the spicy rojas sauce. I got to eat the guacamole that came with the gringas, I like that it was full of coriander and zesty from lime juice. I'm sure we'll be back again...."

Was there a change in management or something? Specifically, the vegetarian platter size has decreased dramatically, some of the waitstaff are straightup rude and they are wasteful as fuck using plastic containers for their guests dining in. Why can't they just wash the containers instead of creating tons of unnecessary waste? There are better Mexican restaurants around that I will be frequenting instead. Check out Mr.Azteca, it's way better."

I've been to El Rey Del Taco twice, and these are probably the best tacos you'll get in Montreal, especially the best for the price. But I'm a Texas girl, I like my tacos and I like them spicy and delicious. I have high standards for my guacamole and while El Rey is the closest I'll come to authentic this far north, in the words of Shania Twain... ""That don't impress me much.""The Horchata is the greatest thing ever! Creamy, cinnamon goodness in a glass, sometimes that's all I need on a winter day. They even sell it to go by the liter! They always give you plenty of house-made chips and three salsa, all fairly mild. My go to are the enchiladas and the lamb tacos (they're halal). Just a tip, order them by the pound, they are cheaper and more filling that way. Also go with friends, and SHARE! The portions are large and you get the most bang for your buck if you're sharing. Plenty of room for large groups, although they close pretty early. Not the swankiest spot in Montreal but pretty close to Jean Talon and Park Jarry, oh and Juliette et Chocolate, so make an evening of it!"

If you're craving Mexican food, this will do the trick, but manage your expectations. In the words of my mother, a Oaxaca  woman with a knack for cooking, the sauces were either too spicy or not flavorful enough, and the green sauce used for the chilaquiles probably had one too many tomatillos because it was a bit too sour. Definitely not the best Mexican food we've had. Service was fine."

The pork tacos are spicy and delicious, the mixed meat plate is a yummy mountain, piled with steak, sausage, pork, rice, spicy meat sauce, sour cream and more. The nachos are tasty but at 15$ they are overpriced and out of synch with the rest of the pricing on the menu. The staff are super funny and nice and they have a sign up declaring their intention to be a business with happy customers that's a great place to work (a-dorable.) El Rey is too brightly lit for me to love eating-in here for dinner so we usually do takeout, although as an afternoon stop during market shopping it's excellent. The resto doubles as a specialty shop full of Mexican products - foods, shampoos and other imported brands. They also sell homemade salsa and guacamole from a fridge in the back - the verde is insanely firey and delicious."

Please do not be turned off by it's poor decorations. You will regret not eating there. This is not at all an Americanized taste of Mexico. This is the same taste you will receive from a home cooked meal, being completely fresh and homemade. El Ray del Taco meals are loaded with flavour(Low in salt!) but fresh! Everything is made in front of the restaurant to which your can see, upon you ordering it. Every bite you take will be loaded with flavour, a low or high amount of heat(Up to you!) and pure comfort to your stomach along with a big smile on your face. Each time I've been here, I ask myself the same thing. When I'm I coming back. It never disappoints. Service from my own experience has been flawless. Fast, professional and very kind. Once the meals were ordered, they've arrived 15 minutes later. On a very busy sunny Saturday lunch hour. One drawback to which I think it can be fixed. Is the payment method. You stand in line on a very narrow and crowded hallway. While the waiters, and clients also pass by you. You feel you are in the way. Which honestly, you are! Many times I've seen 7-9 people in a line wanting to pay at the same time. Waiters asking for you to move. Move where?! There is no where else to go! If this is my only complaint, well I will certainly tough it out in order to have yet of thrice delicious meals again. I will be honest. It does get busy, loud, and crowded. Do keep that in mind if that is not your cup of tea. Also do keep in mind. Their guacamole is out of this world! Loaded with flavour!"

We ordered to share three types of taco meat (you choose the meat and they give you all the other toppings) - carnitas, lamb and beef. All three came rather dry and lacking flavour: we had to put copious amount of salsa to make up for how dry the meat was. Otherwise, the taco shells were authentic shells made out of corn and the three types of salsa (different heat level) were quite good. After my meal, I almost felt like we ordered the wrong thing, how can somewhere so well known and claimed fail so miserably? I will definitely come back and give this place another shot one day."

It's sort of an expanded hole in wall, indoor taco stand, and mini grocery store all in one. They have quite a familiar menu of items like tacos, burritos and even pozole. I was gonna go for the tacos al pastor but I decided to try the gordita instead. I'll start with the sides first: the rice was not a traditional arroz rojo, it was yellow and had more of a saffron flavor. The beans were (canned) black refried beans - nothing special. The guacamole had too much lime and although I do prefer a good pico the gallo in the guac it appeared to have sour cream mixed in there as well. The gordita: it was not a typical chicharron prensado gordita, instead it was stuffed with shredded pork along with lettuce, sour cream, onion, etc., and then doused with more sour cream on top. Typically some of the flavor comes from the chicharron prensado in this case I struggled to find it. We had a large party so they gave us two small chip baskets but no refills. I ordered an Horchata with my meal but they never brought it out. They finally remembered to ask if I still wanted it after all the plates had been cleared but at that point it was too late. I would like to go back and try the tacos - maybe that'll be a better experience -overall but as a first timer it was rather disappointing."

The owners don't even try to make it look nice. But you know what? We don't care, because the food is delicious!As a vegetarian, I was very pleased with the vegetarian plate which is both good and fulling. Thanks to them I discovered nopalitos (diced cactus) and I'm so hooked that now I regularly buy them fresh and cook them at home too. My Mexican partner is a meat eater and he loves the place too, claims it's probably the most authentic Mexican restaurant Montreal has. I noticed he's a big fan of the carnitas and tacos al pastor.Free nachos and sauce (real sauce, not tostitos sauce) are served on all tables. I highly recommend ordering one of their juices too, jamaica or tamarindo; both are delicious. Before going out, make sure to try one of their warm churros; a star-shaped cylindrical Mexican dessert filled with dulce de leche. Three words: Om nom nom."

It was a nice break from French and I struggled to revive my Spanish.We got four different dishes, I ordered the plate of the day (see picture) and it did remind me of eating at roadside comida corridas in Mexico city. A mix of three meats (pork, chicken, beef), sauteed vegetables, salad, beans, rice and assorted tortilla chips with mild, medium and spicy salsa.

The Chori Queso is very good and pretty cheap if you're just looking for a bite. The Taco dishes are serve by the weight and it is pretty decent. I have to go back soon and try all the stuff I ate in Mexico and try to compare. It's a good place to eat a lunch, even when it's packed, it's very easy with 30-40 minutes to get order, get serve and eat. If you're an average eater, calculate max 10-20$ per person."

We waited too long. Secondly, the floor was filthy. I ordered an enchilada with a mole sauce.

Because the other 3 dishes were steak fajitas displayed slightly differently on the plate. ""Tacos"" were basically pre-loaded fajitas. The burritos were fajitas with the same shells tucked slightly under. The taco bowl was a taco shell bowl full of fajitas.But the absolute worst thing?! I requested extra hot sauce and not only did they not give extra, they didn't send any at all! Instead, they sent guacamole covered in MOZZARELLA cheese and sour cream.

The veg nachos are also very nice - comes with veggies, frijoles, rice and guacamole.  Service is quick and at this place they actually bother to check if you are happy with your dish. What I don't appreciate as much is the waitress asking for the tip to be left on the table instead of being paid together with the bill inside (makes you wonder if the owner is dipping into the tip jar, or if they are just avoiding taxes). In any case, the prices are on the lower scale of the $$ category. If you are down for some good Mexican in this part of town - that's where you want to head to."

Anyway, the staff was really nice the service was fast, the restaurant looks nice and cute but let's be real the most important thing has to be the food and they just couldn't give us what we expected"

But this is just us  if you are not use to having  original good quality Mexican food this restaurant will do the job after all this is MONTREAL where you will find minimum amount of Mexicans not many Mexican restaurants ."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Spring is finally upon us in Montreal which means my regular excursions to Jean Talon Market are occurring once more. Outside of the wonderful produce available to us at the market, there are some very interested options for anyone looking for a good meal. One of these is El Rey del Taco, a Mexican grocery store with a terrasse space overlooking the market and dishing out some south american food. With the recent rise of tacos in the city with Grumman 78, Icehouse and Mais amongst others, El Rey del Taco can get overlooked as a worthwhile option but I am here to tell you that would be a disservice.Over the last month, I went for a quick lunch twice. As soon as you sit down, you are greeted with complementary tortilla chips with 3 different salsas, one mild, one spicy and one salsa verde. All 3 are enjoyable - the salsa verde in particular packs a pretty good punch.To cool down from the heat, I ordered a glass of horchata. For the uninitiated, horchata is a rice based beverage which I absolutely love. Nice hints of vanilla and cinnamon within this cold drink. Great refreshing beverage to balance nicely the heat of the dishes. One of my favorite summer non-alcoholic drinks.First up, I ordered the cheese quesadilla with guacamole. The guacamole has a nice thick consistency with the right hints of coriander, lime and tomato with the avocado. The quesadilla was quite good as well. The tortillas had the right crispness to them on the outside without becoming too brittle in general. The cheese in the middle was perfectly melted and had the right tang to it.As a main, I chose to go with the chorizo tacos. The chorizo was broken down and cooked perfectly well with the natural spiciness of the sausage coming out very well. The little sauce added to the mix further enhanced that flavor. Topped with some coriander and onion to add some freshness and sweetness, these were very nice balanced tacos.On the second visit, I went for the lamb tacos. In contrast to the spicy chorizo, the lamb was mild in flavor but had a more tender consistency and a much fattier taste as well. Topped with the same onions and coriander as the previous tacos, these tacos were quite tasty as well. I could have easily eaten the lamb by itself as a meal. Juicy, tender and falls apart without any effort. Just a wonderful cooking job there.El Rey del Taco is a great option for anyone looking for a good taqueria in Montreal. Service is a little up and down but the price is reasonable and the quantity are plentiful. If you come to Jean Talon Market with any regularity, you need to stop by at least one and enjoy a good meal.Cheers!"

As for the food, it was pretty damn salty too. I cannot recommend the food from that place.

Service was good, except for the fact that the cashier charged us extra for stuff we didn't even order. That got rectified once we went back."

As soon as I read that there was a Mexican spot (being Mexican myself) so close by, I convinced them to dine here. Let me say that I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants in New York, & no place in the 5 boroughs has food as flavorful & authentic as Rey del Taco (I'm extremely picky about Mexican food). This place is a total gem in my book! The four of us tried a little of each other's plates: gringas, sopes, Plato del dia, & a quesadilla de pollo. All of these items did not disappoint, and the meat-- especially the Pastor-- was AMAZING. Can't wait for my next visit to Canada & el Rey del Taco!"

In fact, when I have been, the place was stuffed from the front to the back terrasse. The poor waitress was everywhere at once! A popular dosh is a bowl made of tacos, and filled with basically everything in the kitchen: veggies, meats, guacamole etc..etc.. I had the cactus salad, it was good, it tasted unlike anything I knew, but needs more cactus!  The huarache is pretty tasty as well, but I'd steer clear of the quesadillas, not enough cheese (to my taste). The guacamole always tends to be cold. odd. Regardless, any dish will plaster your stomach for the day.Go crazy with the desserts, fried coconut donuts, massive churros, snacks on sale by the cashier's desk.. Aaall delicious. In fact, go crazy with everything, El Rey let's you buy guacamole by the gallon, multicoloured nachos, cacti (oh yeah!) and more (like lucha libre masks), while watching mexican Tv.

I have family from Mexico and i've somehow developed a standard to ""authentic"" Mexican food. From the homemade salsa picante to the excellent guacamole...just fantastic. The food was not greasy at all, the portions were just right and the prices were very reasonable considering the area. I was with a large group of friends and called ahead for a group of 10 at their busiest hour (and they get BUSY), about 12 -1pm and despite the hour, they were extremely friendly and accommodating. They take pride in cleanliness and really care about your experience. The location was fabulous too, right after dinner we check out the Marche and got some fresh fruits for the hotel :) I'd highly recommend !"

The quesadillas are very good with perfectly caramelized onions and peppers and just the right amount of cheese to meat ratio. My husband had the lamb tacos which were equally great. This place is not a fancy place but a great stop for lunch after shopping or even just to pick up a quick taco or 2. We really enjoy this little gem near the market. They don't serve any ""cervezas"" there but will let you go next door to the SAQ and bring a can over...Definitely worth a try!!!"

I had high hopes because I don't mind if places aren't really fancy. Things started off well enough. The guacamole was tasty but came with maybe 12 nacho chips... Our meals came and maybe it was just a bad night but our meals were really salty. Also the tamales arrived about 5 minutes or more before our daughter's quesadilla so we just sat there waiting. We never got water either, and my hopes that this was going to be a cheap, tasty night out were dashed with a $50 bill. We'll give it another shot but might just stay away from the tamales and guacamole. I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that it was just an off night."

/user_details?userid=coFjUcQ_z84LO77CR_n5Fg,Dane R.,"Asheville, NC",3 star rating,"We went here after the awesome Yelp Spring Fling, and had a sampling of a number of menu items. The ""ambience"", if one can use that term here, was part taco joint, part Mexican food store, and part Mexico City bus station replete with a tv showing telenovelas. We were dying for tequila or at least a nice cerveza, but alas, no liquor licence. However, they do have some ""drink if you dare"" Mexican sodas, which contain twice the legal limit of sugar and food coloring of normal soda (which I generally don't drink anyway, unless it's mixed with something). Don't expect too much in any regard here. They do tacos, fairly well, and that's what I'd recommend ordering here, although something possessed me to order the tamales too (more on that in a sec). We started off with guacamole. Having lived a good 10 years in Texas, and traveled a lot to Mexico for work, it was, well, really odd. They mix iceberg lettuce and tomato in with the avocado, and there's nary a hint of garlic or lime. The result is a bit gloopy and fairly unpleasant, especially if you're expecting a beautifully dense unctuous avocado forward, garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro based dip. Oh well. The tortilla chips though, which seemed homemade, were light and crisp, and we even bought a bag to take home. The salsas were equally good, with the tomato based one being the standout. The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas. The tamales though were pretty bad. I am a big tamale fan. These were mealy and dry, and the filling was cloyingly sweet and unpleasant. This place does tacos, and they do them pretty well. I'd come back for the tacos al pastor and chips and salsa, and the telenovelas of course. Hasta pronto."
