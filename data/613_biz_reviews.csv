It's weird that this is only the first review on Yelp. This place deserves to have more hype!I ordered some samosas with chicken aloo, chicken madrasi, and some naan. Â Everything was absolutely delicious. They are not afraid to spice up the food. The flavours are just impeccable. Every last drop of the sauces were devoured. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"
