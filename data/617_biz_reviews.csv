/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, this place is really putting out some great food! Le Speakeasy is now open for takeout so we ordered Korean Short Ribs, Tataki de Thon (seared tuna), Creme Brûlée and a bottle of wine to go. The quality of the food was off the charts for takeout, and priced ridiculously low for what was on the plate (sub $100). I honestly can't believe it! On top of that, the person I interacted with was so nice and welcoming I just can't wait to go back.Some details: the short ribs were slow braised and topped with a sweet and spicy Korean BBQ sauce. Sides were rice and a spicy spinach salad. The tuna was seared and served at the appropriate rare temperature with a nice salad, rice noodles and seafood arancini. We finished it off with a yummy maple Creme Brûlée. Everything was absolutely delicious.I see from previous reviews the kitchen space is oh so cool so I am looking forward to getting the full treatment post COVID-19.  But for now, who could ask for anything better presented in takeout fare?"

We came here for oyster specials ($1) which were from Nova Scotia and hands down the BEST I've had. Yes I am an oyster fanatic and have been to many many places that are even know for oysters. Also, get their Bone Marrow. It came with escargot and there were three of them! So worth getting it to share and don't for get to get a shot to take after finishing them! Our waiter Patrick was AWESOME. He made the dinner an experience by taking a shot with us too! Their cocktails (Montreal something) ones were top notch as well. Highly recommend!!"

This place is a cute restaurant tucked away behind an ice cream shop.Between 2 people we got the ricotta with season vegetables, scallops entree, and short ribs entree.My favorite part of the vegetables was the butternut squash purée it came with. The scallops had a beautiful sear to them and the short ribs were fall off the bone, packed with flavor. Cocktails were also really good and innovative."
/user_details?userid=Gua5GdTlTWJpovtG7Hdtyg,Caitlin H.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"5 stars for food, drinks, and atmosphere. This place is a little hard to find from the outside, what you need to look for is an ice cream shop. Don't be afraid to ask for the restaurant once you walk in! Everything inside is beautifully decorated and fits the speakeasy theme perfectly. The waiter was very friendly and had no problem suggesting drinks. My Mai Tai was strong and well made. I ordered the roasted duck breast which was paired with the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had. I couldn't get enough of it!! Every part of this dish was amazingly done including the roasted carrots. The duck was tender and went down well with the potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs which was just ok in comparison to my duck. It was very salty but was ok once you ate it with the rice. Overall I would recommend Le Speakeasy on the experience alone!"

Such a great atmosphere, amazing service, welcoming staff and delicious food!! We all had a lot of fun!

I was very excited to visit Le Speakeasy following a 10h flight back in October and although I knew how to access it based on some research, I still loved walking through the secret door! We were a group of 5 here for a 5a7 on a Thursday evening and were  surprised to see the place so empty upon arrival (though it did fill up by the time we left). We ordered several of the cocktails from the menu as well as some 'boring' ones (read: rum and cokes etc) which were all good and generously portioned liquor-wise. We also ordered a few items off the menu - the cheese/charcuterie plates were super yummy! Happy with my experience here and would definitely come back - check it out if you're looking for a fun little secret bar to visit!"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I liked a lot of things about this place , I loved the concept of a prohibition era secret bar- they even have the menus hidden in books to mimic that experience, the rustic old school charming decor, to the friendly service. I Really have nothing bad to say about any of those things , I had an overall very fun offbeat experience because of them. However my three stars is because I found this place severely overpriced for what you get in terms of quality and quantity of food and drinks. We were a group of four who all tasted different cocktails (min 15$ each per drink) none of us was blown away by our drink order , it wasn't bad but it was just okay and can't say they were worth the price. one of us ordered ravioli , he paid approx30$ for it and only got 4 raviolis on his plate that we're lacking flavour, we also shared the charcuterie plate which was again just okay , the prosciutto chips on it were Insanely salty (this coming from me being a salt lover), the liver mousse was pretty good but there wasn't much of it on the plate , all in all nothing to rave about and especially not for the price. However, their fresh oysters were actually super big and fresh and were the best part of the meal ! We also tried their baked oysters but sadly I found them too salty and rubbery. Our server was very friendly and attentive though and very knowledgeable about the menu and took the time to explain the concept of the bar to us in a fun engaging way. the fun concept and great service were honestly what made this experience better"
/user_details?userid=fExL6u06xTSg13k945IPAQ,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,"this place was 4 stars because of the incredible service we had. The server was very kind and really made our experience great. Such a unique entrance and if you are not informed it is hard to find! Very cool! The true meaning of a speakeasy. We sat in the upstairs dining area. The menu is very cool and are at a certain page of an old school book. It is a neat addition to an already cool experience.The wine was solid and the cocktails in general hit the spot.We were hot and cold about the food. Some items really hit like the beef shank type entree. It was spectacular. The beet appetizer was not great and the chocolate dessert missed the mark as well.I would highly recommend coming for a drink. Definitely try the beef shank entree. Overall, cool place and fantastic service."

/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We went here tonight to celebrate my friend's birthday and I must say it was a great choice.Started off with a very good Negroni. Our waiter David was awesome, very attentive, funny and all-around cool.The ambience was great, the music did get a tad loud for proper talking without yelling but after a few delicious cocktails you won't mind it so much.The food was delicious. We had breaded & fried shrimps tacos, charcuterie plates, cheese plates, snail gnocci, gravlax, angus steak, duck and octopus poutine. Yes, octopus poutine. It obviously wasn't your ordinary old school poutine BUT if you are gonna go all out, this is it. The octopus was tender and flavorful and paired really well with the sweet potato fries. I would definitely come back here again!"
/user_details?userid=NEek9tPD5ve2tg_br7CE_w,Bob B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We only stayed for a drink and some oysters. Perhaps it was a bad batch, but these were some of least fresh and least meaty oysters I've ever had. The vinaigrette that accompanied it was nothing special either.Drinks were fine.Plus (and this is purely a question of personal taste), I thought the decor and atmosphere was quite corny.Overall, would not come back. There are much more interesting speakeasy style bars in the city."

David, the GM was able to conjure up an incredible drink based on a few vague hints of what we were looking for. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the artistry of the chefs.

/user_details?userid=ulk3n0JW8tWnQ83C7m8z9A,Jay L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This establishment was kind enough to invite the now-married bachelor back to experience what the Le Speakeasy can truly offer.  I want to say that speaking with restaurant management about our previous service experience was a super positive experience.  How they handled the situation has greatly impressed me.The now-married bachelor went back with a friend that also attended the first time around to the restaurant.  They were impressed by the overall service, food, atmosphere, and care by the whole restaurant blew them away during the course of the night.  They enjoyed by the attention to detail when explaining the dishes before tucking away into them.Both mentioned that it was the best food that they probably ever had!They would love to return again at another opportunity and bring more friends/co-workers to enjoy the experience.  i think that truly speaks for itself.Once again, I want to thank Le Speakeasy for their generosity and for giving the proper send-off for the now-married bachelor.  I think this experience was the cherry on top of his bachelor-hood cake. X-D"
/user_details?userid=B7f5iHcyszjiHthLr5_6zA,TC N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's pretty quaint that this restaurant is hidden from view, deliberately so - being of the speakeasy theme. I shan't say too much how you'll be shown in, or how the menus are presented, so as not to give away any spoilers. But it's quite a fun experience. Perhaps more importantly, it isn't just fad; the food is pretty amazing. We had the tomahawk steak, which was some 50-ish oz and could be feasted on by three diners. For me, after cleaning off the steak, yet another highlight was the foot-long rib bone with the remaining smokey meat attached. I didn't know (or care) if in polite company it was acceptable to take the bone onto one's own plate and to carve off the meat from the bone, but I did it anyway and it was amazing. The cocktail menu is also varied interesting. Surprisingly, notwithstanding the prohibition era theme, this is a kid friendly menu."
/user_details?userid=6EQDa-MeN3jN6GJ2ftGeCA,Olivia R.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Great concept, poorly executed. We were a group of 20 which I understand is hard to serve but it took a 1 hour to receive our drinks, which were all over the place and not what we ordered but we would take anything at this point. It took over 2 hours from when we ordered for our food to come....some orders were even lost! It took 3 hours to get everyone's entrees. Most of our appetizers never even came! We complained the entire time and nothing seemed to change....except the server and managers attitude, which only got hostile! Food was good, but not worth the wait. Duck was dry but the rest was great"
/user_details?userid=yjH3ruK_SnNPTK-EAJKmEQ,Kenn T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Jump to ""The Short and Sweet"" if you can't stomach ""The Long Winded"".The Long Winded:I grew up in restaurants. I even spent the first five years of my life actually living above one. I have fond memories of playing around the kitchen while the staff pretended I was helping out. Of running through the serving floor, being told to ""shoo shoo"" because there were customers. And of palling around in the parking lot with the neighborhood kids, clutching cans of Coke, and almond cookies I pilfered to share. So it should come as no surprise that for the first twenty plus years of my working life it was in the restaurant service industry. I managed a couple, served at a few, and have been a chef in so many that I have literally lost count. After roughly forty lifetime moves I've finally deciding to set down roots in Montreal and the food was the number one reason. So, I think it's fair to say that I'm familiar with restaurants and have a pretty good idea of what makes a good or bad one. All that being said, Le Speakeasy has become the standard by which my wife and I hold all other establishments in the area to.""Speakeasy does this better... I like this a bit more than Speakeasy... blah blah blah"", but more often than not it is the former rather than the latter that is uttered.Maybe it's because it was the first place we tried in the city after thirty hours of no sleep and a very difficult and long move, or maybe it's because it's just so damn close to where we live, but I believe it's become our go-to spot because they just do it right. If you can't already tell Le Speakeasy is one of our favorite haunts. And I'll admit I may have a bit of emotional biased because of the reasons I listed above but before I wrote this review I took the time to read all the previous reviews, paying special attention to the negative ones, and this is what I think. If Montreal winters are half as bad as they say, I suspect you will find us hibernating at Le Speakeasy to keep our spirits high, our bellies full and our cheeks rosy warm during those long, dark, cold winter nights. I maybe shooting myself in the foot here as it's our favorite place to sit and seats are few but I recommend that you pony up to the bar. You can chill with Nate, Patrick, or Mary as they meticulously make your drinks over sincere conversation or cheerful barbs. We never feel like we're inconveniencing them when asking for something special. They always seem to delight in creating concoctions of our or their own design while still producing classic clean-cut cocktails. From there you can see Alex as he deftly prepares your meal. You will find that he is fast and efficient while not being hurried. Taking the time to getting each dish as close to perfect as possible, the results have never failed to be crave worthy. It's not uncommon for my wife and I to share three mains between us despite our limited stomach capacity. Is there the odd misstep in this predominately well oiled machine? Ya of course. It's the nature of the business but that brings me to David, the linchpin. You'll find this towering, handsome gentleman greeting you at the door with a warm smile, going from table to table making sure everyone is happy, dealing with any slips or mishaps, helping his fellow co-workers, processing the restaurant's needs, and yet, it seems like he is always there the very moment you realize you need something. The entire staff come together to provide mindful and efficient service with genuine enthusiasm. They take pride in their work and are eager to make your experience an enjoyable one. If you are looking for a place to enjoy we couldn't recommend Le Speakeasy more. There are good people there. Perhaps even better food. ;PThe Short and Sweet:- It's quaint, refined, and rough around the edges, all at the same time.- The drinks are proper.- The food is delicious.- Excellent quality, seamlessly blending gastrolounge with fine dining cuisine and ingredients. - Main dishes are filling if not too filling.- Pricing is on par with surrounding establishments.- The staff take pride and enjoyment from their work and it can be felt.- Fun but professional. Intimate but social."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I want to like this place, but it's a bit much for me. For one thing, there's something about straight-up naming the place Le Speakeasy that uneases me and challenges the gimmick of a speakeasy altogether. Needless to say, I don't think much about the place is meant to be subtle. I appreciate the literary them that runs through the place, with old books as menus, but the rest of the decor and concept is just sort-of ""meh"" for me. Also, while I respect that Le Speakeasy aims to stick to classic cocktails, I've never had the pleasure of having my socks knocked off by the drinks here. And I've tried my fair share of their libations. Perhaps I just err more on the side of experimental when it comes to cocktails?The thing that will have me going back is the after-ten-pm oyster deal (either $1 or $2 each?). I swear you can't get a deal like that anywhere in Montreal, especially in the old port, and the oysters are good. Oh, that and the service- my first visit here (which I will leave undescribed), was nothing short of disastrous for service, but every visit since has been on point."

You gotta check it out to find out.Lunch was empty. Prix fixe menu (24) only. Drinks (8-10) found in a novel. Ordered the lobster imperial (lobster wrapped in wonton skin and deep fried), beef tartare, and their dessert du jour. Lobster was tender, beef tartare mixed in a spicy mayo with 3 bread crusts served up with perfect sweet potato fries, while the dessert du jour was a mix of red velvet cake, vanilla cake and various mousses and creams. Bees Knees drink (gin, citron, miel, blank d'oeuf) was light and not very strong. Gotta keep it brief to maintain the mystery. Definitely worth the visit. They tip post tax using the CC machine if you choose %. Seating area seats 50. Bathroom area is chic balcony. Great photo ops throughout the place.

She suggested this place, but I was very confused since I've been in the area tons, and never noticed it. We were greeted by someone behind the ice cream bar. When we asked about the bar, he took two books out from the shelves, and led us to what it appeared to be a fridge door. Beyond the door, it was a relaxing/chill bar. I loved the decor, the drinks were great, and the shared app was a work of art. I didn't have their dinner yet, but I'm definitely going back with a larger group."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I will admit to always enjoying the thrill of finding my way into a hidden bar, of knowing the trick or figuring it out, of that moment of transition from one room to an inner sanctum where (in the fiction of contemporary Speakeasys that reference darker times) the rules outside do not apply. This particular Speakeasy, though named a little literally, is a treat on McGill. The staff and owners are so enthusiastic and nice and happy to be doing what they are doing. Walking through the sandwich shop to open the fridge door is appropriately sneaky, and the bar behind is dim and beautifully designed. My whiskey sour was excellent, strong and tasty and served with love and thoughtfulness about what I was craving that day. I shared a great big plate with various cheeses and things - I don't remember what all was on it but it was delicious. In general, a lovely addition to the area."

/user_details?userid=rW89FKQNGwCNMoH_GJZPeg,Eric V.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I mean, who doesn't like the idea of a genuine speakeasy, complete with a facade business and hidden menus? Sadly, however, this place does not deliver. On a Saturday in mid-April at 7:35pm I was the only customer. Ordinarily I would have left, but I gave it a shot. The good: the staff was very attentive and polite. The bad: the menu is limited, and the food was not that great (I had the carpaccio). The ugly: the bar is flanked by the kitchen- as in, if you sit at the bar, you are watching the cooking. This might be a nice thing at an Hibachi restaurant, but not here. Also, the decor does not seem to have an ideaof what might be considered authentic for a speakeasy. There are animal heads everywhere... The music was mostly soul... So, I guess I had my mind set on something different. This place could be pretty cool, but as is, on this night, I wish I had just turned around instead."
/user_details?userid=cXciolQyHZiW3uAB_dgPuQ,Ian L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stopped in for pre-dinner drinks with my wife and when we walked in, we thought we were in the wrong place. Instead of going into the restaurant/bar area, you find yourself in an ice cream shop, with no indication that there is a restaurant. But then, someone comes out from behind an unmarked door to greet you and leads you inside. The menus are "" hidden "" inside of books. The waiters and waitresses are dressed like they stepped out of the 1920s. The decor only adds to the ambience of being somewhere that is not what it appears to be. Aside from the decor, the drinks we had were great, martini for me and a white wine for my wife. We had a mixed charcuterie platter to go with our drinks. The service was quick and the staff very friendly. I look forward to going back and having dinner there."

We are here for our honeymoon and I had previously been harassing my new husband to take me to a speakeasy. Being from NJ, speakeasies have been making a come back in the Philly/NYC area and I was determined to go to one. Who would have thought that I would find a gem in Montreal? I don't even know how they nailed the concept perfectly because I don't think Prohibition hit Canada..but somehow...perfect! Food: ridiculous! We had the 3 serving special where the chef does this thing and you get three appetizers/entrees. We got the foie gras (never had it and it was perfect), gnocchi with escargot (again a new dish for us...buttery and the gnocchi was light but with the right amount on heft to it) and oysters...all of it lovely and makes us want to come backAtmosphere: 1920s feel without the kitsch. Pictures of people of the walls and instead of famous gangsters just random folks in simple frames that look like family pics rather than a famous wall of who's who. Music is modern but not a steady thud of base but a smattering of neo-soul, r&b, and well just good! And their menus are hidden in hardback books on a secret page that is only known to guests as well as a secret entrance. I don't want the coppers to know so shhhh.....Drinks: wouldn't be a speakeasy if we didn't discuss drinks. These bartenders aint playing with you folks! Every drink was balanced and considering the alcohols involved in each drink...the fulfill their mission, for you to enjoy your beverage without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. After all mixed drinks were created so that the cops couldn't tell if you had been drinking so you could avoid arrest. With that in mind try the Bees Knees and the Mai Tai! They go beautifully with any light fare you choose.The Staff: Wonderful. Lovely. Accommodating. Sweet. Professional. Great recommendations. Fun. Our hostess and our waitress both were stellar.

NOPE!  The bartender comes over and says there is nothing wrong with her drink and that maybe we aren't used to the very strong tasting vermouth they use.  Keep in mind my wife LOVES Manhattans!  We are speechless though.  Did he want us to admit it was our fault?  I tried her drink as well and it was definitely wrong and tasted terrible.  We have had vermouth before, it wasn't just the type of vermouth.  We just say ok and finish our drinks and get the out.  Anyways, there are many lovely reviews for this place, but our experience was terrible.  Don't go for a nightcap.  Maybe the dining experience is nice.  Also, they propped open the secret door when we got there.  So that just seemed lazy on there part."

We went at a not-busy time so perhaps the atmosphere would be better with a few more people; it was pretty empty and not very loud, and I think this is a place that would benefit from a bit of lively noise. We went intending to get drinks only but were informed we had to order food... which turned out to be a great decision, because the shrimp tacos were incredible. The tortilla was soft and doughy and shrimp was sweet and perfectly fried. The drink I ordered (Bees Knees) was delicious, although fairly strong. We ordered a salted caramel crème brulée, which was quite good. My only complaint was the pricing. I think the food is slightly overpriced and they could do with having a few cheaper options on the menu, especially for people who want to come for drinks only."

Due to flight delays and our groups inability to get our act together we ended up having to call to push back our reservation multiple times. The staff was so nice and completely ok with it. We arrived 20ish mins before the kitchen closed and they were able to squeeze our orders in with no problem. The bartender even brought over shots to celebrate with us. The speakeasy concept is really well done and this stop was the highlight of our whole trip!"

/user_details?userid=iGY19evKMQV64G05iRD6xg,Choua V.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"Pro tip: it's not a speakeasy if there's a conspicuous sign outside that says ""speakeasy.""  That aside, David our bartender was very nice and attentive and made sure that our drinks came out in a timely manner. The cool part walking into a walk in freezer to enter the bar.  This is a nice stop for a quick cocktail before heading out to enjoy the rest of your night."

Came all the way from New York this past weekend and got a few glimpses of the 'hidden room.' If your curiosity compels you, dare to look behind the meat locker lol!! This is one of the hottest places to be in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=rgU9leaeykONba8mtsVivg,Michael G.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",5 star rating,"Popped in with some friends for a couple of drinks while in Montreal for the weekend. Almost went right by thinking we were in the wrong place when we saw the unassuming deli up front, then remembered we were supposed to be at a speakeasy. Right this way through the walk in freezer door and you're in a trendy, hipster but not too condescending hipster, swanky joint. Keeping up with the speakeasy theme, the menu was pegs pasted into the center of a book, for that ""secret prohibition era"" vibe. They don't have a full out bar license, so you have to order at least one food item with your drinks, even if it's just one oyster for the group. We got the cheese platter which was great. Decent selection of whiskeys. Mixed drinks with throwback sounding names. (My wife had the Bees Knees and while it was too sweet for me, she loved it.) All in all, a fun time, friendly staff, and good drinks. Can't ask for more than that."
