/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is definitely a good hole-in-the-wall place with very affordable lunch, perfect for students and broke peeps. U can easily be full with a $9 lunch of 3 choices of sides, a bowl of rice and jasmin tea. It's not pretty and the food isn't the best you will ever have but it gets you where you need to be: full. And this review is based on what that is.The neon lights and the chinese movie playing on the tv makes it feel like you are elsewhere for a moment, it's interesting...We all took the 3-choice plates but I think we'll come back to try the soups and the baos."

/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Warning: Very, VERY Chinese place!! Out of the only 4 times I have seen a non-Chinese person there, 3 times I was the one who brought that non-Chinese person. One of those times, he was Arab and the cashier was trying to talk to him in Mandarin. There is CCTV Mandarin news playing on the TV constantly. That's not a bad point for me, personally, as it reminds me of home. The decor is simplistic: there is none. The concept is that of a cafeteria, where some of the dishes are shown, and you point to the ones you want, and they scoop from the dish. Part of the kitchen is open and right behind the cash. As for the food, the best thing about it is that it's CHEAP. Most of the things on the menu are under 10$ (all the prices include tax), and you can get a rack of ribs for 5$. It might not be fresh, it might not be the best tasting food, but it's cheap. The dishes displayed (3 dishes + rice for 8$) are usually all pretty tasty. The soup noodles are filling, there's A LOT of noodles, but there is not much taste other than the napa taste inside. One of my favorite dishes is the spicy chicken (12$). Although it's slightly dry, it's very spicy just as I like it, and just salty enough. The Asian (canned or bottled) drinks are really cheap too. There's also free self-served hot tea. Overall, this is not the best tasting food, they don't have the best hygiene, and the service is not the best. But they are good at what they do, which is to offer cheap Chinese food. That's their goal, that's it, that's that."
/user_details?userid=eNORuY4cjyQStMygVSSYZQ,Meimei Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the cheapest yet most delicious homemade Chinese food places in Montreal. The restaurant is modest and served in a fast-food style counter. The dishes are authentic in flavour and hits home in cooking style. Many students come here for lunch because of its low price and ""homecooking"" feel. A 3 dish combo is only $6.89 +tax and the same price range goes for everything else on the menu :)"
/user_details?userid=OGVi7P-lpqa17Ae_qV9KBA,Eric G.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,It's not bad place you may choose 3 kind of meat and vegetables plus a bowl of rice. For $9.9 free refill rice? Thanks
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Got the rice and 3 items (chicken, tofu, and eggplant). The portions are generous with free tea and rice refills! The staff are friendly and they have a TV that plays some chinese program. Great deal with honest chinese food. However, the food I got was WAAAAY oily. Like I was swimming in oil by the end of it. Okay, to be fair the eggplant was super authentic and I know it requires a lot of oil but everything tasted kind of similar (oily). It was delicious though."

/user_details?userid=X3nRtVpJ855MCRM9pcpnmg,Andy G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Honestly one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Montreal. I love the gritty and bare-boned, no-effs-given nature of this restaurant cafeteria. How did this place get by the language laws, anyway? Assuming you speak their language, the servers are typically polite and courteous. As you gorge yourself upon 3 authentic home-style Mainland Chinese dishes with a side of rice, all for $8, you can watch the latest CCTV-produced Chinese documentary about some completely random aspect of the glorious country from their television. Seriously, if you want something fast and cheap, hit this place up. Bonus points for their $2 Beijing-style baozis. Tastes like my grandmother's cooking."

Placed right next to JMSB at Concordia, it was extremely accessible.For 8$ in downtown, you won't get a better bang for your buck than here."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Whenever I am craving for some cheap chinese food, this is where I go, since it is really close to school. I always go for the special which is rice with 3 choices of any dish in the buffet. I believe that if you eat there, you can refill your rice and the tea is free. With taxes, it costs $8, which is quite cheap for the quantity of food you get. Their dishes change everyday, so there is always something new, and you do not get bored at all of the food."
/user_details?userid=V5_ScU_trY1t92n6T9P7TQ,Andrew J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Best value you'll find for a great plate of food. The pork spine is so good and worth a try if they have it.You can't beat the price and the selections are interesting. There is no English or French menu. You just punt at the prepared buffet style food and she loads up the plate. Best meal in the area for under $10.
/user_details?userid=pRRxwmabZaEheHTrsl90CA,Audrey L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is what I have considered my secret spot for a while, mostly because it is the kind of restaurant you only enter accompanied by someone who knows the place! It is very difficult to find it if you can't read Chinese (you definitely know there is something up there as there is a sign, but you have no way of knowing if it is a secret Chinese spy agency, Jackie Chan's lair or the best Chinese restaurant you can possibly find in Montreal) but once you do, you become a privileged member of the very special club of those who know (I would have italicized ""know"" if I could). Alright, last time I checked I think there was something written in English, but you could still be confused, and you do have to climb some stairs,  I understand that this involves some kind of commitment, you know, you must be sure there is something worth it up there before you undertake to climb said stairs. You wouldn't want to go through all that trouble for nothing, or worse, have to climb down on an empty stomach. More seriously, you get a very good meal for 8$ (a side of rice with three dishes of your choice) and this is as cheap as Chinese food can get, especially for that quality! The lady who usually takes your order is very polite and there is no waiting time as she will just load up your plate as you point at the dishes and I never had to wait in line!They do not deliver but you can take it to-go and I would definitely recommend getting your meal from here and bringing it back home rather than ordering over-priced Chinese food for delivery, it is worth it! (So, you know, climb the stairs!)"

/user_details?userid=egkatt5zDLzaxDcDQgdKeA,Karen V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great deal for the price. Food was fresh for a cafeteria type setting. For those of you who may shy away from the word cafeteria please don't let that sway your judgement before trying their food. It was worth going there for my first visit and I will try them again in the future.I enjoyed the hot eggplant dish and cold noodle salad the most.Inexpensive, great food for a fast bite, and very decent portion for the price."
