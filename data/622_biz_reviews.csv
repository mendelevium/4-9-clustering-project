They got special dishes (like a ginger chicken thing) on the weekend which shows how fresh it is imo. They also have a small albeit appreciated selection of sake. The menu is extensive, and you can come there for a drink afterwork and have a shared plate of cold meats and vegetables."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a brand new Chinese noodle (Ramen) place recently opened in my neighbourhood.My wife ordered the Chongqing noodle and I ordered the beef noodle.The Chongqing noodle is really rich in flavour yet not too spicy. I had one sip to try out, right away the flavour exploded in my mouth.The beef noodle is standard and you can't go wrong with beef noodle but I gotta say, I wished they provided a little bit more soup. But still have tasty.Lastly we added the the fried pork meat with hot spice on the side. That one is really authentic, reminds me a lot of China.I can't comment much on the service as they are newly opened, it's not popular yet. But I do like the fact they came by and asked for feedbacks in which I appreciate when restaurant does it, especially new ones.Another act that deserve to mention is, their caring. Even for a glass of water, they would ask if you want cold or hot water (because it's freezing outside). It's not much, it's just simply caring."

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We tried the CQ noodles, the wonton and a pork ribs noodles. What's special is that you can get a bowl with 2 kinds of noodles so you're able to try different varieties. The wonton were good and the noodles came in a flavorful broth that wasn't too spicy. We also tried thensalad with shredded veggies and it was delicious. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. The waitress was nice and the wait time wasn't too bad. Would definitely come back to try their other noodles."

/user_details?userid=MAEqpYRNbKwtgdZZL61zOQ,Zee W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Came in with a Montreal local frd on a Friday night. Service was great, the waitress made sure our water bottle was always full and replenished our napkin several times. In terms of quality of food, coming from Toronto, I've always had a high standard in Chinese food. But I was not disappointed at all! We shared the specialty noodle soup, a mushroom and cucumber salad and beef shank. I looooove the topping of the noodle, it is so authentic that I was reminded of street food in Chongqing. If they sell that sauce separately, I'd totally buy some! Cucumber and mushroom salad was quite impressive! These two are rather a rare combo in Chinese food, I especially enjoy the contrast of textures, king oyster mushrooms are creamy while cucumber was fresh and crunchy. Beef shank was great as well! Overall it was an awesome meal! It's worth mentioning their Southwest China inspired decor, I love how they embraced the traditional noodle joint style with a modern twist. Painting on the wall are food from the area. Will definitely visit again with family next time!"

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've visited this spot twice now and each visit only gets better. Located next to a set of condominiums, CQ Montagne is a great hangout spot in central downtown. The decor is Asian inspired with a clean spacious look and plenty of seating. No reservations needed. Their specialty: Asian styled noodles! I tried the braised beef, CQ noodles that are vegetarian and the spicy beef noodles that all come in a spicy broth. If you're undecided- try the Taiji dish that allows you to try two of their choices of noodles for the price of one (15$). Along with noodles there are appetizers and main dishes. The spider shrimp was a lovely dish - with fried vermicelli coated tiger shrimp- you get around 8 pieces that is very generous for the price. Down side because they're so new- there is no liquor license yet. It would've been awesome to have a cold beer with a spicy noodle dish .According to the owner Ray, it's in the works! However a good alternative: order a bottle of their in house made plum juice for 8$. I also scratched my head when I heard the word ""plum"" but it was very a refreshing grape juice taste not the bottle fed kind lol. It's nice to see businesses like this one adding more of a traditional take on Asian cuisine in the Montreal- we aren't Toronto in terms of the Asian food scene but we have solid spots like this one !"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a new place directed across the street from where I work. It's always quite full so I decided to explore this restaurant. The staff is attentive and described what they have to offer. There specialty is noodles from Chongqing China. I chose the Won Ton soup. They do ask you what extent of spice one preferred. Lol. I chose killer spicy and that what I got. It was a knockout!  To balance my palette they suggested this appetizer but I chose to have it after my main meal as a dessert, for its sweetness.! Sweet Pumpkin. It was deliciously wonderful! Pumpkin topped with sweet rice. Unfamiliar to me in which it was presented. Looking forward to dropping in every now and then to try the noodles of course...Good Luck as a new business."
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,"I tried this new restaurant a few days ago. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the food - especially since I was so excited, given the great reviews and pictures that I've seen.I got the speciality dish, which allows you to mix two dishes. I chose the Pork Rib noodles and the Beef Wontons. The Beef Wontons weren't bad, but the broth was oily and tasteless; it tasted like spicy, oily, water. The Pork Rib also had no flavour and the noodles tasted undercooked.In terms of decor, the restaurant has a very modern, clean cut look and feel, which is nice.Hopefully, this was just a one-time occurrence."
/user_details?userid=qNSNV7WQM5lrY1nvZzW1eg,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Had the noodles twice, twice episodes of stomach crumps right afterwards. Because it's close to home, Im giving my third trial, ordered stir fry dishes instead of noodles, waited 30mins and then I was told my main dish was too complicated to make they didn't even start making it yet. I asked why I was not informed 30 mins ago, they were saying they had other client to serve as well. Literally!! There was only one other table in the whole restaurant!! The clay fish was frozen and taste like rubber. I end up cancelling everything and just had a few appetizers for 69$!"

/user_details?userid=x9ZJxsf3VsIovL0BcfjARw,Tram L.,"Saint-Léonard, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I tried the fried pork with chili and the braised beef soup noodles. The fried pork was more like a fried ginger pork than chilli and it was bland. But they did serve with a side of salt and chili which helped a lot.  As for the braised beef soup noodle... it was also bland. At first, I thought it was a light broth and I made my friend to try it and she said it was bland and it wasn't like that the last time she went there. There was no flavour in the broth. I asked for a side of chili oil and it does get a little better but not that much. The beef was tough and not tender.The service was ok-ish. Probably won't return at this place."
/user_details?userid=hGJhZ6Z-sG5ux9yzZc406g,Juna S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I don't give one star so here's two. Didn't expect too much cuz I'm not a big fan of Chinese noodle and my friend brought me here. But the food was even worse than my expectation. I ordered original beef noodle soup,12.99. The dish didn't look good as there's even spring onion root inside. There weren't much beef nor veggies in the dish. The noodles weren't fully cooked and were hard and chewy. The whole dish was bland and too oily. Even if it was a pretty affordable resto, I still think this price deserve way better. Super disappointed.Service was nice though"
/user_details?userid=26biThnRXbDdzTVhi34GTA,Veronica B.,"Saint-Constant, Canada",3 star rating,"Had the noodles with beef, the food was good, i did find it lacked some flavour to the noodles and the pieces of beef given had a lot of fat on them, 40% of the beef was not edible for that reason."
/user_details?userid=_aTqvO3pGe-lNOoM8oasVg,Anthony P.,"Howell, MI",5 star rating,"Great food...great service! Food came quickly and was delicious!!! Came here on a very hot day and the beef soup noodles and spicy beef soup noodles perfectly hit the spot for us, as did a pot of hot green tea (seems counterintuitive to have hot, spicy soup on a 90+ degree Montreal day but it was the perfect late lunch after our morning and afternoon of adventures)."
/user_details?userid=TBOwg26n7wm9PDtZTU4YhQ,Rheanne P.,"QC, Canada",5 star rating,Probably the best vegetarian noodles i've ever had. Broth had such a good flavour and the vegetables were really tasty. Food came very fast and the woman who served us was very nice! CQ cocktail was also very good. Highly recommend this place !
/user_details?userid=NEek9tPD5ve2tg_br7CE_w,Bob B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious and authentic. Very affordable. I've had the spicy wonton, spicy beef noodles, dry beef noodles, and hot and sour noodles over a few visits. All very good, and decently spicy!"
/user_details?userid=RU7K54qCLmGrgRgo39c70Q,YC N.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good. Portions are pretty filling and it's cheap for what it is! We had the Braised Beef noodles and Spicy Beef noodles, both pretty satisfying on a cold winter day. Wishing they gave us more veggies though. Restaurant is spacious and clean."
/user_details?userid=IBA7VbsqUq4cWBo8JBm53Q,Cindy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Favorite noodle joint in town.  Authentic Szechuan flavours and good ambiance.  Their Taiji noodles are  one-of-a-kind and a must-try.
