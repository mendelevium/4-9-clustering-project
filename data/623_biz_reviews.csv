/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Cute little coffee place in point Saint Charles Not much around here so it's quite convenient. The prices for coffee it's quite reasonable and good flavour. They are limited in supplies but it's still new in the area. It definitely looks like they are improving there stock and quantity daily. I had a croissant and it was quick tasty. I noticed they make sandwiches too (next time) I like that that offer individual fruits on the go for under a dollar. They seem to be trying to become a convenient store and coffee shop. Two in one where it's most needed.. I hope this works out and worth dropping in for a quick peek!
