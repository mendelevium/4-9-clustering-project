First off it is a bring your own wine , which is always a plus. The location was nice inside, clean cozy and casual. The service was so friendly and attentive , The pricing was reasonable and the food was excellent , you cant ask for more !  We came here on a Tuesday night for dinner and the place was packed , so definitely show up early or try to make a reservation. They bring you their regular menu and then they have a board of seasonal specials to choose from as well. The sushi was so fresh and tasty , we were so impressed with each roll that we had , it melted in your mouth and you could taste each of the flavours inside. They had lots of options with seaweed and many with rice paper which was nice. Theyre very generous with the amount of fish in each piece. I highly recommend this place to any sushi lover."

The first two times were before they moved  - which in my opinion was way better. We were four people and we decided to roder all the specialties. In the past they would bring each specialty on a separate plate and the pieces were huge. This time they brought all the rolls on one board as if they were regular rolls. Very dissapointing. Pieces were very inconsistant in size. Service was a bit slow. I used to recommend this place a lot but now I don't think I will. They also did not have their famous octopus salad which used to be amazing. Quality has gone down since the move.

Great service and bring-your-own-wine too! Must-try!!! Intimate or small groups recommended! Easy to find parking nearby. We also went with our young kids !
