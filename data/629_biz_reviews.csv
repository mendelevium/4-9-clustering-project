/user_details?userid=7RLTlbjC8uDySlVkoqFiYA,Patience S.,"Morristown, NJ",4 star rating,"Four for dinner on Pride weekend on Saturday on the weekend of a major anime convention in August in Montreal. *You* look for a place.We walked by Boris Bistro and were immediately taken in by the garden seating. It was so beautiful and relaxing, although very dark.We had the poutine, the squid appetizer and I had the fries in duck fat with mayonnaise. Always get duck-fat fries. For dinner we had swordfish, the trout, the duck risotto and the foie gras appetizer with onion jelly. The poutine was sublime. Best poutine of  poutine-heavy trip. The duck risotto was perfect. I ate every grain of rice.Both fish were excellent. The staff was friendly and service excellent. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was how impossibly dark it was, We all had to pull our phones out to use flashlights on the menu and to see our food when it arrived. It certainly was mood-lighting, but it was a tad preciously over dark. Otherwise, it was magnificent."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Disappointing experience at Boris Bistro, mainly because of the service. We were a group of 9 on a Tuesday evening at 6 pm. It took 20 min to get drinks and 35 min to place our orders. Then our entrees took an additional 20 minutes. We finished our main course 2 hours later at 8 pm. It was very long. I took the small portion of the duck risotto and it was literally 4 spoonfuls. It was alright and such a small portion! It's too bad the service was so slow because this place has alot going for it! The entire menu is certified gluten free, they had 4 different bottles of wine that were a 40% off special that week so we were able to try a couple bottles instead of just one. The atmosphere is very nice and it's a nice location in the old port."
/user_details?userid=GoviUvfLsoKR3Pj7HUXyeA,Alexandra M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Very poor service. We had a reservation and got food and drinks but right after we paid the bill, while our glasses were still full, we were asked twice in 10min if we could sit elsewhere because a group of 6 was waiting for a table outside. This group in the meantime was sitting inside with drinks so no need to rush. It is very rude, especially fromthe manager  who was very insisting... the last time I was treated that way was in Paris...Food is okayish but wayyy too expensive for what it is (patatas bravas too oily, cocktails with too many sugar in it). The patio is nice but there are other patios in old Montreal where people will treat you better!"
/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,Ethan T.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"Another A+ food experience in Montreal. My wife had the trout gluten-free and I had the three fillets of beef with fries. The food was absolutely amazing, service was really on-point and not rushed at all, and all associates were informed of gluten free and how to accommodate any food allergies. Also, a big focal point is the outside courtyard atmosphere. On a sunny, blue sky day, this restaurant is a definite must visit. Truly a memorable experience and definitely would've visited this restaurant a second time if we had more time."
/user_details?userid=TVN3qoXU0-sateboutdCZg,Angela H.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",5 star rating,"An overall very successful execution of fine dining with the terrace setting, service and food if compared to places to eat of the same kind. I ordered to duck risotto as a small plate and the rabbit with potatoes. Along with two mojitos to complete meal went well. I wouldn't say that I was amazed but I would say I was satisfied with the entire experience. The service itself from our waitress was A++. I wish the terrace was lit better in between day to night but it was such a minor hiccup.The meal itself was fulfilling, tasty and enjoyable. We had walked 20 mins from our hotel but def taxi cabbed it back because we were so full."
/user_details?userid=TgG3J58v5bEhMB8YCQ1TbQ,Cristina P.,"Bellevue, WA",4 star rating,"A solid 4 star review!If I've learned anything about summers in Montrral, it's all about the terrasse!  In my short visit to this city, it's probably my favorite one.Very spacious terrasse and tucked away behind some iron gates on McGill, walking in somewhat reminds me of the Secret Garden.  It was perfect for a hot summer day.I ordered the salmon tartare entree, which included died of duck fat fries (if you read my other reviews you know how I feel about DFF), salad, and a glass of ceviche. You heard me right - 3 sides for one main dish! All three were delicious - the tartare was seasoned perfectly, the ceviche reminded me of Peru, and the DFF were parfait. Full as my dining partner and I were, we also ordered dessert - white chocolate and raspberry spring roll with maple ice cream. Perfect and light for a hot summer day.I will be back you can bet on it!"

/user_details?userid=Gnkq84PL6E5dYdhJvruAAw,Roxane A.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Perfect for afternoon drinks in the summer! This bistro's best quality is it's location and decor. An urban garden growing in the carcass of an old building, basked in warm rays of light. Great for a date or a (slightly expensive) 5 à 7. The sangria is fruity, fresh and high in alcohol content... The menu was pretty diverse for a bistro. I had the beef tartare, which was pretty good if it wasn't for the excessive amount of capers...Overall, a beautiful place to grab drinks. Will definetely be returning for the ambiance."

They seated us in a very tranquil shaded outdoor area. I had their scallop risotto half portion, which was out of this world! It was so creamy yet not soggy, and the scallops were large. Everyone enjoyed their gourmet meals. My only wish is that I got the full portion but it was a little too pricey for me for a quick bite to eat and I didn't want to walk to town on such a full, heavy stomach. Highly recommend this gem to locals and tourists alike!"

/user_details?userid=rBZ1AptxfylFtZFod-00aA,vincent p.,"Agoura Hills, CA",5 star rating,Pleasant terrace even though we finished our meal under a patio umbrella under the rain. Had their foie gras appetizer which was delicious and generous (2 nice slices we could share). The gnocchi with rabbit in a citrus flavored sauce was quite delicate but I found the rabbit a bit bland but still quite good. My wife enjoyed halibut with beurre blanc which she truly enjoyedToFinish the chocolate maple so called French browny. Was also very good. Staff was attentive and very nice which made for an outstanding evening. The terrace is in a location which was a former fire station that burned down some decades ago. Only the facade on McGill is left and some mature trees now grave the beautiful terrace. I would go back without any hesitation. Prices I find were better than comparable places in the area.

/user_details?userid=uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"We were walking towards Old Montreal and hadn't had lunch, and it was getting pretty late. I was looking for a place still serving food a little after 2pm, and while headed to another location we walked past Boris Bistro. I saw the really beautiful patio, with plants and wrought iron tables and umbrellas, and I decided to stop in here instead. I'm glad I did! It's so relaxing to sit in their really beautiful outside patio area, but it's still relatively private; it's walled in from the street. It feels a bit like eating in a garden :) We got caught up in the moment and ended up ordering a bottle of rose :) We're on vacation, so day drinking is OK, right? I had the salmon tartare with salad and fries, and my husband had the half portion of scallop and shrimp risotto. I thought his risotto was the perfect size for lunch, but him being him, scarfed it down and was looking for more food. Luckily, my tartare came with a huge portion of very tasty duck fat fries and lots of greens, and I had plenty to share. I really enjoyed the slightly spicy sauce that I ended up using on everything. Summary: solid food, friendly service, and a really nice atmosphere."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"When first arriving at the address listed this looks like an office building, but a few feet further you'll see the preserved heritage stone facade that opens on to a leafy lovely terrasse. When I called in advance Boris couldn't take my reservation for 10 for 5pm but assured me there was a good chance we could be seated when we arrived, don't know if it was the cloudy skies or the fact that we knew we'd be done by 7 but they seated us no problem (much to my relief) and accommodated all our extra guests without batting an eye.The staff in general I found super sweet, attentive without hovering, and just generally professional. Nom-wise I enjoyed my wine immensely, and the rounds of duck fat fries with the mayo-ketchup-Harissa dip were definite crowd-pleasers. Overall, a great option to have in your pocket for downtown / old Mtl terrasses."
/user_details?userid=nkX9riHbrASlZcTfnAMGiw,Diana C.,"Albany, NY",3 star rating,"Tough call. I'm stuck literally between a 3 and 4. The ambience was exactly what we needed on a serene summer day and the food was good enough, but in the context of Montreal it was just ok.  Boris Bistro is located on Rue McGill and hosts an outdoor terrace that transports you to a secret garden in the middle of a bustling city. This earns them 4, maybe 5 stars as it is the perfect respite for a relaxing lunch, brunch, or dinner.The menu holds its own in a city like Montreal with offerings such as bison tartare, lamb shank and duck confit sandwich just to name a few. The drinks were solid and they have happy hour specials on the beer (it leaves much to be desired but at least they offer something).  I tried their sangria which was good, my friend had one of their cider beers (she seemed less than amused), and the boys got a sparkling red wine which was delicious. They score a 3/4 on drinks. My party started out with the charcuterie plate which disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. It was a tough call for me between the duck sandwich, the risotto, and the fish offering (I forget what it was), but I'm a sucker for duck (done right) so I went with that.  I have to say, I don't think I've experienced duck quite like that before. I imagined something shredded, succulent and flavorful in between 2 pieces of bread... at least it was shredded.   It wasn't a bad experience, it was just different. The duck was served almost in a waldorf chicken salad style over sprouts in between 2 slices of a nut bread.  It was enormous with a more than generous amount of duck. The combination worked, especially the nut bread...I just wasn't what I expected so I was slightly disappointed.  I wouldn't get it again, just from personal preference. My friend ordered the lamb shank, and lets just say the next thing we knew all that was left was a bare bone, so I guess that was good! The other 2 ordered the bison tartare which they said was good but I didn't get an ""out of this world"" vibe from them. The food is a 3-4.In a different city, this may earn a much higher rating but with so many other options in Montreal, the main reason to come here is their cozy outdoor terrace on a beautiful summer day (maybe for drinks and apps)."

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with a friend for happy hour and we got to be seated outside on their terrasse, which was so beautiful , it feels like you're sitting in a big hidden garden but it still feels chic yet comfortable and non pretentious. It was so pretty and had such a relaxing atmosphere. Great date place or for a relaxing happy hour. Our server was very attentive and friendly and was very good about looking after us even though they were very busy.  The drinks are already very reasonable priced (especially for the old port) and they were prepared so well. They also offer a happy hour special for 6$ for the cocktail of the day. I tried their special which was a strawberry sake cocktail , it was so well made, it wasnt too sweet or too strong it was very well balanced and you could still taste the sake and fresh strawberries inside , I loved it ! My friend also tried the Negroni and he said that it was delicious as well. I am giving them 4 stars because I only got to try the drinks and didnt try the food yet , but judging by the plates I saw go by and the delicious aromas , it would be worth coming back not only for more cocktails but also to try the food !  I will make sure to go back for it and then hopefully be able to upgrade this to a full on 5 star rating :) Definitely worth checking this place out if you are looking for a nice drink on a beautiful terrasse in the old port without breaking the bank!"

I cant explain how bad it was. we basically stood around confused if we should sit ourselves, then finally a hostess came  by and sat us.Waitress took forever to bring us water, didnt bring plates or utensils, and took almost an hour to bring over a soup, app, and i think a salad. Also, once seated we had to wait about 15 mins to even get menus. i get it, im from NY and im impatient, but it seemed really poorly organized here...everyone was basically sitting around for awhile. the tomatoe soup felt like it wasnt a soup and was actually marinara. Delicous marinara but it wasnt a soup. The froie gras was delicious, but barely came with bread to put it on. Trying to get even a glass of water here was difficult, and what felt more impossible was asking for some bread. It was just so slow, un organized, and our server seemed like she didnt know what she was doing. There were plenty of waitors, some empty tables, so i have no idea why this place has people running around like theyre not sure what theyre doing."

As a result , the restaurant offers a quiet and romantic dinner or business dinners ;) As for the food , I really enjoyed my rabbit as I got to eat a bunny that was roasted for hours along with brocolis that was served in their sauce that was house made. I could also argue that the plate was pretty small and it doesn't really fill you up 100% but I guess you'll still get to enjoy the great quality of the food .My partner had the risotto , which was able to fill her up and based on her comments , she really appreciated it.Last thing , the lemon juice is literally house made and is probably a necessary drink if one is thirsty during one of the epic hot day of Montreal ."

But, we wanted to sit in the patio so we decided to proceed with lunch regardless.  We ordered the grilled salmon and caramelized walnuts on baby spinach and endives and the shrimp and quinoa.  Both dishes so incredibly flavorful.... we ate every single bite of it.  No room for dessert (unfortunately).Thumbs up for originality of dishes, good service and ambiance."

We check and were told that unfortunately there is nothing and so we ask what the wait is - 30 minutes we're told.  Ok! Great! No problem! We'll wait - oh but are you sure you want to wait? Are you sure you're willing to sit and wait right here? Are you sure you're willing to wait because it may not be 30 minutes and we don't take names down and we actually have a very long reservation list and are you sure you really want to visit our establishment and wait around????? Because clearly we don't want you to do that!! Well, I guess it wasn't worth the hype after all if their own staff are so adamant that a wait is not worth my trouble! Great customer service!

As it is not very well marked from the outside, we had a bit of trouble finding it.But it was well worth the walk and search; we were not disappointed!Since it was August, a cafe setting in a terrace was perfect. We received prompt service and ordered the seared scallops over risotto, with lobster oil. Asking for the lunch portion we were perhaps misunderstood to be asking for the large portion.

I'm just a happy tourist from New York City, specifically Brooklyn!Duck fat fries were on me and my friend's mind as we made our way back to Old Montreal on our last night in this elegant Canadian city, resolving not to leave until we've tried Boris Bistro's legendary fries. But they paled compared to the service: our waitress was extremely nice and even though we only had 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, and duck fat fries, she kept on checking to see if everything was all right and let us stay for two hours, never made us feel rushed, and even offering snuggies (available for all their customers) when it got a little chilly!! All I kept thinking about was: joie de vivre! This is what life is about: enjoying wine, good company, great conversation, great setting- outdoors underneath umbrellas and trees with chirping birds- and duck fat fries!I wish I could rave and rave about the fries, they were great, but nothing out of the ordinary. Crispy and firm, with a bit of mayonnaise, each fry was delish, but I couldn't figure out how they differed from regular french fries other than the name. Yet I'm not backing down from my 5-star rating because my Boris Bistro review takes the whole package into consideration, and the whole package was an early birthday present wrapped up in elegant wrapping paper and a pretty ribbon tied with great care.I left Boris Bistro and Montreal absolutely glowing!"

However, after I finally got a chance to try it, I fell in love with it immediately.The best part of Boris Bistro is their terrasse. It's only open during summer time and looks like an abandoned back yard brought back to life by the merry guests. Very few things can beat the feeling of sipping a refreshing drink under the trees in a breezy summer night.Boris Bistro has a nice wine list and surprisingly cheap happy hour drinks that can make sure you are drunk before the night comes.Of course, the food is the highlight as well!I tried their red tuna, grilled to perfection.

The combination of chocolate and salted caramel is just divine!I'll definitely go back there for more drinks. :) The waitress told me that it's better to go before 5pm, or it may be hard to get seats."

Not once before or during our meal, did he come back to refill our water or see how things were. Other tables received bread, which was complimentary, but our table did not. I ordered the vegetarian dish- celeriac root with cashew purée. The portion size was literally that of a starter. The 2 pieces of celeriac root were covered in a soup like sauce with cashew purée on the side and a small arugula salad on the top.

Was horrible My gurlfrind started with a chicken salad and it contained 3 leaves of lettuce and the chicken was non existent they tried to make up for the non salad salad and subsititude sevetal leaves of lettuce and nothing else I ordered  A Johnnie Walker Black straight up and maybe it was a half a shot Then for my main course I had a lamb dish that was breaded it was the worst lamb I ever had. All in all I would not ever recommend this place. Only plus the tomato soup was decent. Oh yes in addition my girlfriends wine had very sparce alcholol in it It wS cut with juice.

My husband got steak and we had to return it because it smelled rotten. Ordered a Mediterranean salad, it was horrible. Chicken was cold. This place was recommended by the concierge at the hotel and I believe the hotels recommend this place because the owner has an agreement with the hotels for the referrals. Montreal has great food so go somewhere else. We enjoyed all other restaurants besides this one."

And make sure you try one of their snazzy cocktails-I particularly enjoyed the Mojito Boris.  This is a very happening place, lots of locals, so if you can, make a reservation."

Our table was not ready when we arrived. After some scrambling we got seated. The crowd that night was mixed. There were the required number of beautiful people, but also had some what appeared to be office groups which were quite loud. We sat in the terrace area which is pleasant at night. I stared at a busy spider constructing his intricate web while I waited for my cocktail which took forever to come. The servers were polite, courteous, too young and are just that, servers. At that price point i would expect a more professional staff. My cocktail got messed up not once but twice and the waitress never offered a complimentary one; Real rookie stuff. Again at this price point one should expect more. The meal was satisfactory, the portions were however small. Overall, the terrace area was pleasant and the weather was nice so overall our experience was OK. operationally, things could be quicker, the staff could be more seasoned. The place probably won't be there next year.PS:  I wrote this review July 29, 2013.  The fact that the resto is still opened, is a testament to the low standards Montreal has come to accept."

Beautiful relaxing terrace with an amazing façade facing the street (maybe to maintain the old world integrity of the area) and nice trees on the inside. Perfect place to hang out with old friends. Inside looked very modern and a good alternative if the weather is not cooperating for the seating on the terrace. Food was good although they were out of cheese for the poutine so I decided to go for a similar style dish that is more of a Portuguese style, not sure if it is even on the menu since it was suggested by the wait staff as we felt like poutine that day. The mayo on the side was delicious so do not forget to use it as a dip for the fries. The second app was grilled scallops with risotto and lobster oil. I am not a fan of risotto so not sure why I ordered this dish, probably because of the scallops. Liked the two scallops, however the quantity of risotto overpowered the overall dish. I would go for something else next time. Service was good. I would recommend this place to others"

She said the ambiance is lovely and the terrace is beautiful. I must admit the atmosphere is quite nice. You feel as though you're indoors yet outdoors. I think the terrace was less floral because of the extremely hot summer we had this year. But other than that, there was lots of green. My dish was salmon tartare and it came with fries. I enjoyed it. Not one of the best salmon tartares I've had, but it was still a good eat. My boyfriend's dish on the other hand was more expensive and more disappointing. A mahi mahi that was served slightly cold. He only liked the potato slices that were undermeath, not the main attraction of the plate. What really disappointed me was the popular chips with duck fat. We decided to order it to go because we wanted to see what the hype was all about. Almost everyone around us had those chips.  Instead we got totally ripped off with only a small bowl of chips that tasted almost burnt.  5$ for those chips...I've never spent so much money on chips in my life.I give this place a 3 because my dish was ok, my boyfriend's dish was really not ok, and the chips were a total rip off.

I had the trout salad with walnuts and spinach, and my husband had the home made parpadelle with chorizo.  Both under $20.  My dish was light and yet flavorful.  The fish came in a good portion and was quite filling.  The chorizo was really tasty and the parpadelle was rich but not disgusting. Despite being in a hurry, we opted to try the maple creme brulee for dessert.  It was delicious, although I couldn't really tell the maple taste in it.  It's also a fun place to people watch.  Large groups of friend and people on their first dates, drinking lots of cocktails and having a good time.  A great place to dine on a summer night."

Our food was left under the kitchen heater so long it was hot and cold at the same time (was there no one designated to run food?)3. Our waiter was covering too many tables and could not manage all of them (e.g. I asked for a second glass of wine with dinner and was brought the menu half way through my entree). Management take note. The food is average at best and the menu predictable. Montreal is supposed to be one of the best ""culinary cities"" in North America.

I followed it with salmon tartare, actually a wedge of raw salmon accompanied by a small mixed greens salad and string potatoes fried in duck fat. It was better than it sounds. My dining partner had seared tuna and it was equally good accompanied by steamed vegies. For desert we tried the incredible chocolate with salted caramel, actually a hard mousse (fudge) and so rich the tiny portion served its purpose just right.

The maître d explained to us quite nicely that if we were going to eat at the restáurant, then we had to be out by 8 pm due to their liquor license. Since we were tired and hungry, we said that an hour was enough. They seated us in their beautiful garden patio and our waitress, without rushing us, took our orders. She got our orders of duck risotto, grilled lamb and tagliatelle out fast. The food was simply amazing and the service was fantastic! The duck risotto, in particular, was so good that it might have ruined other risottos for me. This bistro certainly beats the fine dining restaurant we were at the other night, in terms of food and service. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

/user_details?userid=Uwu72w77MPox942_GnCS7g,Avitania B.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"Good food, but the service was a little off; perhaps because it was a busy Saturday night, or because the server was having a bad night. Either way, it was a little off-putting. However, the food was pretty good -- especially the braised duck with polenta (topped with bacon -- what what!). With that said, it's not the best meal in the area, but Boris Bistro certainly has the best patio."

The food was good - fries cooked in duck fat, yummm - and the service was pleasant, but its the outdoor patio that makes this place special. Great for an afternoon umbra on a hot day."

/user_details?userid=C5RK6X_BY90EGWCLKTPy2g,Coren D.,"Brookline, MA",3 star rating,"I'll be honest. We had just arrived in town and were looking for lunch. I had decided to go to Holder and walked past this place thinking this was it. No sign, no name on the menu, just a beautiful outdoor patio. So after we were seated, we slowly realized we were in the wrong place. Oh well, menu looked good, and it was a nice shady spot on a hot summer afternoon, so we decided to stay. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (24$) to start. It was fresh, juicy, nicely chilled, and HUGE! Enough to serve a party of four. We ordered the foie gras nem starter (13.50$). It is a large piece of foie gras, wrapped in phyllo dough and deep fried like a spring roll.  As you bite into it, the melted foie gras oozes out. The cider reduction balances the richness with sweet acidity. It was delicious, but somewhat challenging to eat. For mains, I had the venison sausage (17$). It came with a generous portion of duck fat frites, with the house special mayo. The sausage was tasty, not over seasoned, but a bit dry and dense. The fries were excellent: crisp, not greasy. My wife had the grilled salmon salad(17.75$). Unfortunately she felt that the fish was overcooked and did not taste fresh, and the salad was overdressed with onions. Service was fast and attentive. Overall, I think Boris Bistro is a great place to enjoy drinks and have a decent meal, but come here for the patio and the ambiance, not the food."

/user_details?userid=Z9m54ZkavZLPYV2vnACiCQ,Christopher B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"We went here after the light show at Notre Dome in Old Montreal.  It is a short walk, about 7 blocks, and has some amazing open air seating in their courtyard.  When we got there we walked into the restaurant and saw that no one was in there.  We started to get a little scared but then we were directed to the courtyard which was packed.  Once seated we were greeted by a nice waitress but she seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of people she was waiting on.  We ordered our drinks and about 10 minutes later.  Then it just got worse.   We didn't get any bread, our appetizer took a decent amount of time to come out and our meals were pretty late as well.  That is the service side of things, now for taste.  The appetizer we got was very good.  My wife's meal was amazing but my meal was pretty bland.  I can not fault the restaurant for this though.  I ordered a pasta that comes with andouille sausage, but I asked for them to keep that off.  So the pasta wasn't up to the full potential.  I would suggest this restaurant again and I would probably give it another try but I would definitely look at other restaurants before coming back."
/user_details?userid=4sowSwVKPfoj7nsg8ZCN0g,Albert C.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Everything was perfect...!!!  We had fries cooked in duck fat with a great sauce to complement it.  The rack of veal was tender, moist and the balance of flavor was phenomenal, perfectly executed.  The snail feuilleté had a very rich and creamy sauce that was so good that we used the basket of bread to scoop up every last drop on the plate.  All of this for a very reasonable price.  We will definitely come back again."

Duck Risotto was just ok- the duck was good- but the dish was filled with oil floating. Creme brulee was decent- they should have heated that up like most french restaurants do. Waiter was friendly, the manager not so much- walked right past the guy walking out and the guy didn't say anything etc. Good place but not great."
