The battered menu cover of this unpretentious nook isn't lying - 老友记Amigo offers the best pork chops in town, and by far!!Following a friend's recommendation, we came to this Cantonese restaurant on a random Wednesday night. To be completely honest, as I walked up the stairs, I was at first hesitant. The place looked empty from the entrance and it seemed like the grandpa chef was eating his dinner on the table. Following a little internal debate, I decided to venture in, and let me tell you that it was the best meal I've had for the past four months! Following a chat with the waiter where I practiced my struggling Cantonese, we opted for the Combo for 2, as the waiter kindly offered us some tea.Within a minute, the pork-tofu soup was on our table. It was served in a big bowl where the waiter scooped out two nice portions into smaller bowls, a little detail I really appreciate. Shortly after, the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops and the Beef with veggies (+ rice for 2) were ready. The chops were golden crispy on the outside and tender in the inside, and as you bite into the crunch, you can just taste that flavoursome cutlet (and wow the quantity)! Paired with rice and bok choi and some thinly sliced beef, this was an easy 'rice downer'. Okay so the cluttered inside decor with the plastic tablenap is perhaps not for everyone and the dishes are quite high-calorific; however, your belly will most definitely be happy! :)Definitely 5 stars! Can't wait to come back to try their 4 people menu!Price: all in all ~ 28$ for 2 people. And it comes with fortune cookies!"

This place is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. Well, I'm glad I didn't miss it!The decor is definitely old-school Chinatown. But that took nothing away from what my friend and I ordered. We were greeted promptly by the waiter who brought us our menu and a nice fresh pot of tea. We ordered some peanut butter dumplings, along with an order of General Tao chicken and Singapore noodles. Everything was really delicious. And overall, it was reasonably price. I can't wait to come back with a bigger group to be able to try more dishes!"

The service was incredible and the food... even better. If I could rate this place higher, I would as I feel 5 stars simply doesn't do it justice. The Salt and Pepper Pork chops, that they are famous for, deserves all the praise it receives. 5/5, Will definitely stop by again"

Little fly in the wall place. Ordered general tao, pork chops which comes with fried rice with an egg on top. I love pork chops and these were the best I've tasted in a while! Only negative thing would be the bathrooms...they smell and it's dirty! They could really use a deep clean!"
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I go here occasionally when I'm around the Chinatown area and want to grab a bite to eat.I will normally order either Cantonese Chow Mein or their Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice.I really like Cantonese Chow Mein and I've never had any issues with Amigo's Cantonese Chow Mein. During my recent visit to this restaurant, I ordered Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice.This restaurant has three Salt & Pepper Pork Chop dishes/plates. You have the plate that is only Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, another plate that they call ""All Dress Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice"" and finally ""Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice"". When I'm in the mood for Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, I will order the ""Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice"". The only difference between this dish and the ""All Dressed"" dish (excluding the price) is that the ""All Dressed"" dish included a fried egg. I'm not crazy about eggs so the regular Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with rice is fine for me.When I come to Amigo with my family, they will sometimes order one of the dinner meals that comes with salt & pepper pork chops.The Salt & Pepper Pork Chops with Rice comes with a few pieces of Pork Chops (deep fried) with some spices/peppers, rice, and what I believe are a few pieces of bok choy or Chinese cabbage (but you can see my order from my uploaded picture). I didn't count the pieces of pork chops but I felt that for the price that I paid, it was a good deal. After eating my dish with some Chinese tea, the waiter gave me a fortune cookie with a piece of candy. I was full after my meal. I could have eaten more but I was more than satisfied with the amount of food that I got.From the posted signs, this place accepts credit cards but only if your order (not including tax & tip) is more than $10."

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"#1 pork chops, as per their menu. Really? I mean, there are a lot of places serving salt and pepper pork chops in the city, and proclaiming it #1 is a big task. Let's go and get a taste of it!Door hidden between 2 stores leading to the restaurant upstairs, it is quite easy to miss this restaurant when strolling around Chinatown. But don't let this run-down appearance deter your experience; the food is indeed quite good, and I would tend to agree that it is indeed one of the better pork chops I have tasted in Montreal. Taste-wise, it was a good mix of salty and lightly spicy, which goes well with white rice. The restaurant serves a special menu for lunch time during weekdays which I find it a very good deal: for 8$ after taxes, you get a small bowl of wonton soup and a plate of rice (fried) with any kind of meat you would like. I obviously opted for their sal & pepper pork chop. Needless to say, it was more than filling. However, if you feel even more hungry, you can get their special at 11.50$ that gives you a LARGE plate of fried rice, with huge amounts of pork chops, bok choy and a fried egg.Truly a place to not miss if you want to discover cantonese food in Montreal, located in the heart of Chinatown!"
/user_details?userid=amirIjTf7gMGm9j-IgmjCA,Kimberly H.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Came here after a recommendation for its famous salt and pepper pork chops, and I'm glad I did. There's a huge yellow sign with Amigo if you can't find it and its located on the second floor. As I walked up the steps, I didn't know what I was in for. The whole place was completely empty, tables were covered in white plastic bags, and covered up windows. Sketch much? But anyways, we were starving and ordered four hot sales. When the dish came out, we didn't anticipate the portion to be so huge. There were like 5-6 pork chops, perfectly cooked and crispy. Large bowl portion size of fried rice that seemed to be cooked in a layer of oil and fat. But that's what made it so good. A few bok-choy here and there as well as a large fried egg. I didn't finish it nor did two others so our leftovers combined seemed like two full orders. My bf was the only one that finished everything and boy did he have the itis. The waiters speak Chinese and French, but understood our Chinglish.  Get the Hot Sale. That is all. Credit card accepted over $10"
/user_details?userid=KW6NA5wBKWP_464aUCEMXQ,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Who knew! This little place would have honestly one of the best Chinese food in Montreal!It's a big statement coming from me but I've had my fair share and trust me it's good.What brings me back? Those famous Salt and Pepper pork chops! The lunch special comes up to 12$ And it's a bang for your buck. That would be my first recommendation.. my second would be to try the various chicken and seafood options which are great to share and enjoy other people's company.I can't say much more but I would definitely bring people here for a quick bite!Enjoy!

/user_details?userid=r8Fg03YuJifOZVn6HG_QuQ,Amol U.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"I'm not sure I see the charm. Yelp, you let me down on this one ..?Amigo isn't bad, but it's also nothing particularly special. It's like Panda Express or any other typical Chinese joint. The food options are standard, the tastes and flavors are pretty run-of-the-mill, and the presentation is very much average.On top of that, it's about as hole in the wall as it gets. Kitschy decor, plastic tablecloths and cheap rickety chairs, the whole deal.Maybe there's something I'm missing .. but if there's a charm or secret to Amigo, I didn't quite catch it. Hard pass on this one."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: The entrance is a bit hidden but it leads you to a second floor. Inside looks a tad bit rundown. You can tell that the restaurant has been there for a while.FOOD: The food was ok. Mind you I came here at around 11 at night. I ordered the beef rice-noodle stirfry with a Chinese broccoli dish. I've had better elsewhere. The veggies were way too salty to my liking and the noodle dish was just ok. I do hear that they have the best pork chops in town so I will be sure to come back to try that. But if it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't come here.PRICE: For the vegetable stirfry, I thought that the portion was not worth the price. Overall, prices weren't too bad but it wasn't worth it for the quality that you're getting.SERVICE: Service was ok, classic Chinese restaurant servers."
/user_details?userid=eHYsne3HbyHJ0ws_1ASWfA,Juan Paulo A.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,"Amigo restaurant One of the best Chinese food in Montreal. When I used to live there, we would go here after clubbing or just need a place to hangout in the late nights.  Location: Right in the heart of Montreals Chinatown. Not much parking, mainly on street. It's on the second floor, making it hard for people with mobility issues. Small place, lunch and dinner hours are usually busy but worth the wait. This is a hole in the wall people, don't expect a Ritz Carlton. 4/5 stars Atmosphere: Nothing really special atmosphere. It's a typical Chinese restaurant. No loud music and no tv. It can get rowdy and loud depending the kind of crowd is in the restaurant. 3/5 stars Service: For a place that gets busy, the service is great. Friendly waiters, the owner is also very friendly, making sure everything is to your satisfactory. 5/5 stars Food: Best Chinese food in the 514. They are known for their pork chops, but they have a great chow mien and the deep fried squid is also good. Back to the chops. This crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Not too salty, and if when you add the hot sauce, it brings it to another level! 5/5 stars Price: The food is reasonably priced. Last I was there, we had ordered; pork chops, fried squid, chow mien, BBQ duck and some rice. Plenty to bring leftovers back home. 4/5 stars Overall: This place has not change one bit! Delicious back then and still amazing now! 4/5 starsFollow me for more pictures on:Instagram: 905japesTwitter: 905Japes"

You come here for this dish and this dish only. Don't bother with anything else other than a beverage. Guaranteed to satisfy.On each of my experiences here there has been a lone waiter. Older gentlemen, but you couldn't tell by his swift and deliberate movement between the kitchen, the tables and the register. This man does it all and deserves a firm slap on the ass for his hustle. Good game!Seriously, is it just me or is the 11pm close time posted here wrong? I'm pretty certain that on at least 2 occasions I've dined-in after 3am on a Friday and Saturday night... Or was that supposed to be on the hush? Oh well, just another reason (as if I need one) to return and test my memory.-Bean"

This time, I came with a close friend.We ordered the famous pork chop rice and some dimsums. I wasn't really hungry on that day.Pork chop was amazing. Crispy and juicy. UNEXPECTED egg on the rice. That's a big YES! It also come with bok choy to balance the meal. I had lots of pork chop in my life. This one quality is outstanding.In terms of dimsum, the sui mai (pork) was a disappointment. The ha gao (shrimp) was alright. I think it's better to focus on their specialty. Mayonnaise chicken is a must to try.The meal came with good tea. Good service. Good ambiance. Nothing too fancy. Good for a quick lunch or night dinner with friends.Strongly recommend."
/user_details?userid=1y_qPXTSAJsPoVFM80HeMg,Steve S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,OMFG. Worst general Tao chicken ever.  It was more batter than chicken. Most places have a light coating on the outside but this place is 60% batter and a tiny cube of chicken. The oil is also ancient. Taste like it hasn't been changed the past decade. The stir fried e-fu noodles tasted undercooked. The rice tasted like there's some old oil in it as well. The only decent dish was the vegetables. Never returning to this place. The chef was sneezing and the wait staff coughing. Disappointing given the 4 stars this place has. Do ppl of Montreal have no taste buds???
/user_details?userid=cnbOfidXU1Fa7NE-T9PHvw,Steph M.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,Went here thanks to yelp!Hidden restaurant in China town so you could miss it if you aren't looking for street numbers.Ordered sweet and sour pork which was delicious and came with green tea. Service wasn't all that great even when I was the only person in the restaurant.Would probably order take out next time so you don't end up sitting awkwardly there by yourself with the staff!

Yes, Hot Sale is basically a great deal or special that they came up with a while back and it became worthy.Plastic on the tables, windows covered up and maybe the dirtiest menus around. Order the HOT SALE and move forward.What you get- a TON of fried pork hops in some form of delicious batter, rice, fried egg and rice.This is a place to go to say you had it, it is good....it is a Hot Sale. My recco is to not eat fried food for 1 week prior, do not plan in having hot wings anytime the next week. Glad I went and did it. Now I'm good."

I do love any form of Yang Chow Fried Rice, Cantonese Chow Mein, Won Ton Soups and Half Chickens. They have all these and do it amazingly well. Their specialty, Salt & Pepper Porc Chop is okay. After a few bites you're nearing a stroke by all that lard and pork fat. But that's okay. You'll share it with some friends.I heard they replaced the carpet with some wood floors. They definitely deserve 6 stars now."

Crispy chicken, seafood bird nest and beef with ginger and green onion. Also I asked for some ground ginger and green onion in salted oil as a delicious dip for the crispy chicken.   Dinner was great. I'd recommend the food at the Amigo.  The men's washroom was gross the women's was better but still dirty.  I wasn't there for a wonderful bathroom experience I was there for the food.

Hot Sale.  Not Hot Sa-Le.  Typical American who thinks everything in Montreal is French or maybe Spanish mistake I suppose.  The name Amigo is also deceiving-- there's nothing Spanish/Mexican on the menu-- it's a Cantonese restaurant to the core!Now for the Hot Sale-- it's pure genius.  It's what I crave late nights.  It's what I crave when I'm piss drunk, hung over or both.  It's what I crave when I'm in Chinatown.  Salt and Pepper Pork chops, egg fried rice, a fried egg and some fried boy choy!  Flippin fantastic.  If you read the red Chinese scroll on the wall-- he's self proclaimed famous for his fried boneless flounder and salt and pepper pork chops.  Everywhere you look, there are posters of the owner being named one of Canada's Top 100 Chinese Chefs, etc.  Most of it's probably BS anyways but the FOOD is NOT.  5 pork chops on the Hot sale is no joke.  It's fried perfectly and lots of salted hot chilis all over the dish.  If I lived in Montreal, I would be coming here every night.  Booyah."

I tried the salt and pepper pork chops (the lunch version, not the full-on Hot Sale), and it was delicious. Juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. I want more. I would have these every day if having battered fried food all the time didn't kill you. We also had mixed veggies and wonton soup, and they were pretty good. Even the hot tea they put out for everyone is quite decent. They pale in comparison to the pork chops, though.The waiter is very friendly and is always hustling. The food comes out quickly and all at once. A few seats for singles and pairs, and a few tables with lazy Susans for larger groups.I personally love places that don't really prioritize decoration. Amigo has layers of plastic covers on the tables that they can just dispose of and posters that haven't changed in years. I think it allows me to concentrate on my pork chops. I will be back for the Hot Sale very soon."

I suspect they got these from Kim Phat in the frozen section, cuz they taste very similar. They are definitely not fresh made that's for sure.the rest of our food was good, we had salt and pepper pork chops, and chow mein all very nice and standard.
