Although it looks small from the outside, we were blown away by how much this store has to offer. Ailments Amica offers homemade pastas, sauces, and pastries, all made with fresh and natural products. We were able to speak to the workers and we learned that the recipes are all created internally, based on family recipes and traditions. They are committed to making the best products they can with the most authentic and fresh products around. Â When we stopped by, we tried their Bombolonis, cannolis, and tiramisu. All of these pastries were incredibly delicious. The Bombolonis were huge and filled with rich hazelnut and custard fillings. They were made right in front of us as we ordered, so we knew they were as fresh as they could be. The pistachio cannolis were also insane. We've never had that flavor before but it has become a new family favorite. The tiramisu was also so yummy. Although I'm not a huge coffee person, we also tried their in-house coffee brand: Eropa Coffee. I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back for more :) We had a great experience at the restaurant, but our favorite part of this visit was the marinara sauce and gnocchis that we took home with us. Two words: in love! They were both so good and you could really tell the difference from store-bought sauces and pastas. All around, we had an amazing experience here and we can't wait to come back! Hoping that they start doing their take-out gnocchi dishes once covid dies down and summer comes around!"
