I have been to this restaurant numerous times already and I can't wait to go back soon!! One of my favorite items on their menu would be their signature dish C'Wow which is a magnificent chocolate dome.The server will pour hot caramel sauce over the dome to melt the 70% dark chocolate dome and then it will slowly reveal the goodies that are hidden inside such as the brownie bits, waffles, a variety of berries, pecans and a scoop of ice cream of your choice.C'Wow was just wow! The presentation was exquisite and the taste was marvelous! Highly recommend!!!C'Wow ($18.50)"

My goodness the chocolate was rich and it was a perfect balance of hot and cold with the ice cream and the chocolate drizzle on top. I can't wait to go back to Montreal just to have this again. Also customer service was excellent ambiance was great!
/user_details?userid=d_uSfozaAZR4OpDNa8IiZQ,Dy M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Love love this place! It was a surprise when we ordered the 'show'Rama which was delicious! The salad was amazing and the meat was on point! My wife had the chocolate egg waffle which was nice but she had asked for pecans and they didn't exactly deliver! Great place for a date! They take credit card and they are open late! The hot chocolate looks out of this world!

Everything was exactly as it looks in the pictures and the menu had way too many delicious selections!

Well, maybe that's a little over the top, but I saw about this place, sought it out, and it fulfilled my dreams. The fact that it was pretty empty was a little saddening because I was so dazzled. If you want to indulge, this place is chocolate heaven.They have a pretty extensive menu, and they have some lunch foods, but I was okay skipping this. There are a lot of chocolate drinks, milkshakes, chocolate pizza, fondue, as well as ice creams, brownies, etc. And there are flavors beyond chocolate. A waiter takes your order, but there's a great digital menu board with a lot of images of what to expect as options.Since this may be my only chance to visit, we decided to partake in 2 desserts to try the variety, but 1 is more than plenty for 2 people. They are huge! 1) the Black Jack Bubble Waffle. I was intrigued by the waffle wrap filled with ice cream, hazelnut spread, brownie bites, strawberries, whipped cream, and branded chocolate pieces. It was a cute presentation, and a nice mix of flavors, and so decadent. 10/102) C'Wow. I saw this on a digital menu board and wanted to see it myself. It's almost like a little show. It's a perfect dome with some treats outside, but then the waiter pours caramel sauce over to melt into the dome to reveal gelato (a few flavor options) and more chocolate pieces. It really was a wow moment to watch. 10/10I wish I lived near this place and I would love to try all of their options over time. I hope they franchise and that more people come try this ASAP."
/user_details?userid=3qMeM2IZP1L_E-aI08-0xw,Vi L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Last day in Montreal and we wanted to have some really good hot chocolate and coffee. It was understandably empty when we walked in on a Monday afternoon. We had a really big lunch so we only ordered drinks: Classic Hot Chocolate and an Affogato. The drinks were okay! It was decent espresso and gelato and decent hot chocolate. I think people come here mostly for the presentation/ instagram pics. Everything seemed to have some gunk on it though--- like there was a small piece of something light brown bobbing around in our water pitcher, the spoons and water glasses needed a little bit of a wipe down.  The tables and chairs had a lot of crumbs on it. Kind of cheapened the experience a bit, but it was fine."
/user_details?userid=NVNI1BcvlD8U_b7Q9REBqg,Anya K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Diabetes central, but so worth it! This is a cute late place great for a date, study sesh, or just some dessert. They have a giant menu which will likely satisfy some craving you may have. Lots of crepes, waffles, hot chocolates, shakes, and unique desserts (it also has savoury food that sadly my partner and I didn't try). I got the Blackjack bubble waffle wrap, a fluffy waffle which came with brownies, strawberries, gelato, chocolate inside, and some chocolate caramel sauce drizzled all over. My partner got the C'Wow, a dark chocolate globe with brownies, waffle bits, berries inside, which then had hot caramel poured on it that then melted the globe, revealing its insides. Definitely recommend, my partner and I could barely finish our plates and our sweet craving was definitely satisfied."
/user_details?userid=l6y1_khn2V29gzu_srRlIQ,Grace Y.,"Temple City, CA",5 star rating,"C'cho colate- This place is inda chocolate paradise. The menu is filled with endless pages of desserts you can ever possibly imagine. If you can think it, they have it. Skip all the other chocolate places you find in town that you THINK will be the spot to get your chocolate fix. True chocolate fanatics will be here. They vary from drinks to shakes to waffles, crepes and beyond. All coming in an awe-spiring display. I look around there wasn't a drink or a dish that I didn't drool over. Impressive.  Ok, the ambience- they have both inside and outside seating to cater to any size groups. Cute and witty chocolate sayings all along the wall to make anyone smile. The best one to sum up this place is ""chocolate is the answer- who cares what the question is"". I got the mochaholic crepe consisting of dark chocolate ganache, coffee gelato and drizzled with chocolate. If that's not enough, they scatter cocoa nibs on top of it to give you that extra chocolate kick just incase you missed it in your bite. The taste- the crepe is made soft like a big pasta sheet. The chocolate is not over bearing. You'd think it'd be chocolate over load but it's dark, not too sweet or bitter. Absolutely love it for us dark chocolate lovers. The coffee gelato is a good touch to bring out.. everything and more. Wow. This is amazing. I seriously can tear the coffee gelato just by itself too. C'wow. A dome of goodness. Waffle, brownie, hazelnut ice cream, raspberry, blackberry, strawberries, and pecans all inclosed in a 70% dark chocolate dome. Holy WOW! Oh wait, they pour warm caramel sauce so after you snap a quick picture of the dome, it collapses to welcome you to a world of sweets buffet. It was quite overwhelming trying to figure out where to start. This plate/bowl is more on the sweeter side for you sweet tooth out there but the berries bring your pallet back to earth and get you ready to want more of the mystery dome. The bf and I both didn't finish our sweets, too much goodness. All to say, you can definitely come in a larger group and get a few to share or be ready to raise your white flag like we did. Great experience. Would come back to try other items next time."
/user_details?userid=A1p7_78TTBocmBqLuZ_MFg,Jill-ann P.,"Atlanta, GA",3 star rating,"This placed definitely scratched the much needed sweet itch. We both got bubble waffles (the King Kong and the Black Jack).  The waffles were spongy so I would avoid them. The ambiance was pretty antiseptic.  So it's more of a utilitarian experience:  order sweet, eat sweet, leave.  It was nice to have a glass of wine with the dessert though. Probably wouldn't go back."
/user_details?userid=u0FJ0gi4mCG9ssbZ7uaPnQ,Aishwarya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"This place is for all the chocolate lovers but beware one cannot have a lot of chocolate at one go. Now repeat what I said 20 times before you order. We ended up ordering a chocolate dish each and I ordered mocha coffee which is not your regular mocha and ended up wanting to throw up because it was too much chocolate. They were delicious, it's just we should've shared one dish. We ended up wasting a lot. Our waitress was nice but I wished she warned us and told us not to order too much. The mocha coffee was delicious but it was too much chocolate and very little coffee. The C'Wow was wow but it's for 2 people. Other than that it is a great place to have desserts"
/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",4 star rating,"Between the multi-course meals, fresh bread and butter, and chocolate-oriented dessert bistros, it is a wonder that I can fit into my jeans after a recent trip to Montreal. We decided to skip the shopping and headed straight for dessert. Our plan was to start with C'ChoColat but if there was a long wait, we would then go to Cacoa 70 or Juliette et Chocolat, in that order. Luckily for us, our first choice was able to accommodate us and we were able to settle comfortably on banquette seats towards the back.The menu is huge and I would encourage you to carefully consider all your options before falling in lust with one of the many wondrous concoctions. In addition to choctails and a variety of hot chocolate and coffees, you can also enjoy mason jar-sized milkshakes topped with whipped cream and cookies. There are also sweet crepes and Liege waffles, covered in gelato, fruit, Nutella, and other sweet treats. Or you could try a dessert pizza (yes, dessert pizza - what could be better?) or chocolate fondue. I went with a Black Jack bubble waffle, think bubble wrap made with a light, sweet waffle batter, and filled like a taco with hazelnut gelato, whipped cream, brownie chunks, strawberries, and chocolate pearls.The crepuccine is a crepe cut into fettuccine strands with brownie ""meatballs"", gelato (pistachio, hazelnut, chocolate, vanilla, or coffee), and sauce (dark, milk, white, or Nutella). You get to decide the gelato and syrup. As well, it was served, as if we were in a trattoria, with white chocolate shavings ""cheese"". The decadent treat was in a word: creative.The table opposite ours had the right idea. Everyone ordered something different, hot chocolates, milkshakes, waffles (Liege and bubble) and even a pizza. And they shared! And Instagrammed!It was an afternoon of pure and enjoyable indulgence.We were both impressed by the sole server who worked hard to take orders, clean tables and collect payment. He seemed to thrive on the general busyness of the place."
/user_details?userid=iF_nTUa6rS-o7MfFHD1dNg,Alice F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",5 star rating,"My favorite dessert place near Concordia is pretty over the top. Really, one dessert can serve two or three people, but you're not coming here to be modest. My favorites are the bubble waffles: you won't go wrong with any of these. The C'wow is a signature dessert for a reason: impressive presentation and delicious. The signature Mason jar milkshakes are also a decadent option, and that's a dessert in itself--not a drink to go alongside a dessert. Unless you're a teenaged guy, like my son, then you go for it. Friendly and prompt service as well! A winner."
/user_details?userid=YIyv5qCemnTjfnwPfHlbMA,Christopher J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Fantastic restaurant to get your dessert on. Their milkshakes are some of the best I've ever had. We liked it so much, we visited twice in our weekend in Montreal!I had the berry white chocolate shake, and it's was creamy, and not overly sweet like some shakes can sometimes be. My wife got hot chocolate, in which she chose to use bittersweet chocolate. Their tiramisu was more chocolatey than I expected, but still very good.The ambiance is hip and modern and probably makes for a great date spot. As an added bonus, the servers are some of the friendliest we've encountered in Montreal."

My attention was immediately taken when I saw their dishes! They have so many unique chocolate options! The shakes all look incredible! My friend had the matcha matcha man and loved it! Another friend had the crepuccine and wow! What a creative concept and it was so tasty! My other friend had a Liege waffle, and it was the closest I've found to actual Liege waffles this side of the Atlantic. I had the bubble waffle and it was incredible! The flavors that they mesh together are so perfect! They also allow you to pick what kind of chocolate you want on your dish so the possibilities are endless! My only recommendation is to come when you're hungry because these dishes will definitely fill you!"
/user_details?userid=E3OyZh9aLWhKX2ctlMT_4Q,Jessica C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"DESSERT. Definitely the best milkshake I've ever had! I got the Matcha Matcha Man and I loved how it was the perfect level of sweet. My boyfriend got the Nutella Banana Split, which was also quite good but requires a huge sweet tooth. CAFÉ. The cafe ambiance is decent - great for friends or a casual date. They do seat quite a few people, but definitely get super busy during night time. SERVICE. The reason I'd give this place a 4/5 is because of the slow service. It took about 30 minutes for our order to arrive, since they were super busy near closing time.  PRICE. The milkshakes are on the pricier side (~$15) for the quantity. Despite the service and price, I still think about the milkshake and would love to return when I'm in town!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"More and more disappointed by one of my fave dessert places. I took the c'chocolat crepe with a coffee gelato on top. The crepe was overcooked, way too hard and not chewy at all. I asked for nutella but it came with milk chocolate. The coffee gelato tasted a bit too sour. It's not a good feeling when you pay 20$ for a dessert and end up not really liking it. As for the service, our waiter was very nice and had a great smile. The food also came pretty quickly."

We got seated quickly enough and chose the Vanilla Milkshake and the Crêpuccine. It took a while for it to arrive but the presentation was so cute! They drizzled the chocolate on top of the crêpe and added cheese-looking white chocolate on top of it. It was chocolate heaven! It took a while until we could get the receipt because they were getting busy but it's always fun to go there with friends as a treat (since it is a bit expensive). -----------------------Mon copain et moi sommes allés au C'Chocolat Lounge un samedi vers 3pm. Nous nous sommes faits asseoir assez rapidement et avons choisi le lait frappé à la vanille et le crêpuccine. Ça a pris un peu de temps pour arriver, mais la présentation était adorable! Ils ont coulé du chocolat sur la crêpe et ont ensuite ajouté du chocolat blanc qui ressemblait à du fromage parmesan. C'était un paradis de chocolat! Ça a pris longtemps pour recevoir la facture puisque le restaurant commençait à se remplir, mais c'est toujours amusant d'y aller avec des amis pour se gâter (puisque ça coûte un peu cher)."

They were kind about it and brought out small samples of hot chocolate and fudge brownie bites to keep us in line. The menu is pretty extensive for a dessert bar and the space gets pretty crowded. I love this place for its creativity and design of the desserts.
/user_details?userid=hRdl9qivZonhHrI7umhifQ,Hennie Rose D.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,The most amazing dessert place I had ever been to and I'm from NY/NJ. Totally loved this place and it was even better because it was literally 4 store fronts down from our AirBNB. We went here every single night while we were in Montreal. We had the huge chocolate ball that melted when the server poured warm caramel over it. The following day we had a strawberry waffle and a cheese cake waffle I believe. The presentation was amazing and the portions were more than generous. Everything was perfect and tasted DELICIOUS! Definitely a must if you're in downtown Montreal. Service was also great. Servers showed us pictures if we wanted to see it before we ordered. Which was great.
/user_details?userid=HvZ76OHGhBi1ES8jZIvEtQ,Steve P.,"Wixom, MI",4 star rating,"If you must have chocolate, this place is for you. Everything is decadent and beautifully presented. It has a great look but surprisingly it's the only location. (The waiter said 2 more will be opening in a couple of years.) We ordered warm alcohol coffee drinks which were a delicious dessert in itself. The menu doesn't note it, but alcohol drinks have to be served with food--so a brownie is included. Not knowing this, we also ordered a Nutella Sushi Crepe which was served with chopsticks for fun. Everything was very good, but plan to be stuffed after. Nothing here is petite. As a picky downside, the menus (physically) are kind of disgusting. The lamination was peeling off the pages, the corners curling, and the spiral wire binding was rolling off. It took away from what otherwise was a crisp, fresh, and elegant vibe."

It is very clean and the service is wonderful. The waiters here are very professional and friendly. Each waiter carried around an iPad which has photos of the menu just for customers it they had questions. So I had their signature C'Wow (Chocolate dome melted which was melted by warmcaramel sauce. I requested NO pecans and they were able to adjust. It was fun while it last and it was honestly a pretty small portion. Even after my full meal I was able to eat most of it. It tasted like lots of chocolate mix with ice cream and some fruits so expect it to be very sweet but they do provide everyone a glass of tap water.Overall I think it's a nice place and of course fancy it is going to be $$$$. So I think this isn't a place to go daily but more of a occasional kind thing.

After trying to get something and eat it while sitting down at the uninviting Maison Christian Faure on Saint-Catherine (Really? We can't sit in your little dining room while we eat our stuff because you've started closing it down before it's supposed to close? Can't blame you, I'd want to leave too!), we happily took our money elsewhere. That was the right choice. C'ChoColat is large, friendly, and unpretentious. We ended up with two Mason jar shakes and a crepe - all involving Nutella, of course. Everything was brilliant. I was very pleased with my Noisette shake - if you're into hazelnuts, this is what you want."

There are dishes to please any sweet tooth either in excess or with some level of dignity, just kidding. Eat it all. To be honest, I was half expecting heavily oil laced chocolate however, I was surprised to be greeted by well balanced chocolate between ease of manipulation in the kitchen and faithful flavour of cacao bean extract. It's not where a chocolate snob hangs out but it's where the rest of us mortal hang out. Oh! And enjoy the intermittent giggles you hear when people receive their plates!!"

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 Modern, spacious, great place to grab dessert and hang out with friends. [QUALITY] - 3/5Chocolate was high-quality and complex. All other ingredients were just average and not worth the price. [ORDER] - 3/5Mochaholic - $14.00: crêpe dressed with dark chocolate ganache, coffee gelato, covered with chocolate and cocoa nibs. The chocolate was very decadent and had bitter tones that balanced out the slightly sweet coffee gelato. I liked the complexity of flavours, but the crêpe itself was not fluffy enough and hardened in the area that touched the gelato. There was also a bland cake cone on the gelato that tasted like cardboard.  [OVERALL] - 3.5/5I was underwhelmed by the crêpe, but the chocolate was pretty rich and flavourful. I would not recommend this place for their crêpes because there are plenty of less expensive and better places for that in Montreal."

We decided to get milkshakes to start we had the Oreo cheesecake and my match match man. They were a decent size and very tasty and are pretty to look at ! Next we had the icy hot pot which is a deconstructed s'mores with a scoop of your favourite flavoured ice cream which was good however the crumble in this dish could have been a little sweeter. The tiramisu I had was light and tasty and offered a real authentic taste. And some how we had room to still split a rocky road waffle which blew me away it was not to sweet but still really delicious would recommend this one for sure !"

We got caya coco and single fruit fondue. The drink was very coconut flavor dominated, and I think we would have been better off selecting another drink like red velvet.  For fondue, they have variety of options you can pick from-dark, milk, semisweet, white.

When we first arrived there wasn't too much of a crowd but there was a lack of service. We were seated after a few minutes and left for about 10 min until a server came (he may have been the only one working). Once we ordered, the dessert came relatively quickly .... 5 min wait. I ordered the C'Wow one of the restaurants specialties. This is a dark chocolate dome filled with your choice of gelato, waffle bits, brownies and mixed berries..... it was amazing! Presentation was wonderful, taste was on point. The caramel was rich and not out of a container, you may think the dark chocolate is overwhelming but once you taste it... the flavours together are perfect and not bitter. The other items on your menu are very typical of other dessert places I find that the C'Wow was very original and a must try. Atmosphere 3.5/5Service 3/5 C'Wow 5/5"

Something for everyone, me and my sweet tooth, and her and her love of dark chocolate.We are already making plans to come back tomorrow night for an encore!  Don't miss this place!"

Please change the your Sunday closing time to 10:30pm not 11pm.We came all the way from California and walked 30minutes freezing below zero just to make it before closing just to be told that the kitchen closes early at 10:30pm.

My friend and I came on a Saturday night and shared the C'Wow (which is a chocolate dome that melts when you pour hot caramel on top of it, revealing ice cream, a liege waffle, and brownie bits). Although there wasn't that much food on the plate, boy was it filling! A great dessert to share, especially since it is a little on the pricier side at $17, but a really cool experience! Also noteworthy is the service - the staff were all super friendly and the food came out quick.

The name lead me to believe this was the equivalent of a very bouje Ben and Jerry's - boy was I wrong... Instead, I left with a massive bill, but a very full stomach and had to take out a mortgage. The service, and aesthetic are spectacular. I found it incredible to be able to watch from my table the cooks making the sandwiches (yes they do serve way more than desserts much to my confusion). The service was phenomenal with our server being considerate, informative, and very polite. The only issue I had is how crowded it was, how medicore the food was, and the insane price that followed. Go here if you want to splurge on bizarre dishes including chocolate pasta, but not if you make less than a six figure salary."

That was awesome. The texture turns out really nice and smooth after stirring for a bit, and the taste is so much better than the instant hot chocolate we're used to. Next up was what I came here for ... the C'Wow (pronounce ""say wow"") - the magic dome of chocolate that melts as they pour piping hot caramel over it ... only to reveal an inner level of ice cream and brownies ... I MEAN COMEEEE ONNNNN!It was D-E-Licious. A little decadent (obviously) but suuuuper yummy and the textures were all there ... the yummy melted chocolate, the tough brownie, the cool ice cream. I just can't stop thinking about it. Definitely recommend this ... no doubt at all!This is among the few places I'd say I'd go back to when traveling - a rare honor lolStay Cheerful ;)"

They serve it in a cast iron skillet with melted chocolate at the bottom and gooey roasted marshmallows on top.

It was so aesthetically pleasing. The portion was good enough for two. However, it tastes ok. I think the mix of warm caramel over the cold gelato is polarizing. The crumbles also add a weird texture that isn't felt throughout the whole dessert. On looks alone it's a five stars but sadly looks aren't everything. The restaurant itself is very comfortable and clean. I also had an awesome waiter! He was super friendly and guided me through the menu. They have new bubble waffles!

I can only speak to the desserts as we came here after a lovely dinner at LOV. I was hankering for something sweet and boy did I get it. We did not even have to wait that long for the restaurant being packed. My friend and I had the matcha souffle with the pistachio gelato and a wonderful side of hot dark chocolate to pour over. I loved that my matcha had real powder over the souffle, it tastes strong and bitter and when tempered with the gelato and the dark chocolate, it created a good flavor combination. My table got the red velvet shake which was gone in a hot minute and at the other end of the table, the chocolate C'wow was a beautiful shiny tempered shell covering a well plated dessert underneath. Everyone seemed very pleased with the C'wow's combination of liege waffle, brownie, gelato, crumble, mixed berries, and pecans."

I'm craving it as I'm writing this haha. The Fleur du sel caramel stood out for us, we basically licked the plates clean for it.Another group got the must-try half-chocolate-dome C'Wow, which comes with a dark chocolate dome filled with waffles, brownie, gelato, crumbles, berries, and pecan. The waiter will pour the caramel over the dome to melt the dome and reveal the inside, but you could ask to pour the caramel yourself to control the portion. I find when the waiters themselves pour it the caramel is too much and the sweetness becomes way too overwhelming (who knew that was possible?). It's also a lot more fun to pour it yourself!Overall a great experience!"

Came here last weekend after a friend said he had heard good things, and I'm still dreaming about the amazing 'fettucine' I ordered.The place itself is super cute and cozy, and was bustling with people. We waited about 5 minutes for a table for 3, and during our wait, we were offered small samples of hot chocolate which were delicious. Once we were seated, we spent some time going through the very extensive menu and had a really hard time deciding. I ordered the C'Royal drink (super strong) and hubby had the C'Caramel (equally strong) both of which were delicious. The drinks were served on a small platter each with a side of chocolate drizzled fruit which we thought was a nice touch. When it came to order our plates, the three of us settled on the C'Wow (chocolate dome dessert), the Creppucine (with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella), and a waffle/cheesecake combo. First of all, service is super fast. Second of all, the plates are HUGE. Third of all, I haven't had a dessert this good in forever and a day (the Creppucine is to die for). Super flavorful crepes sliced thinly and piled on the plate like fettucine, mixed in with pieces of deliciously perfect brownies, drizzled with nutella, and topped with white chocolate shavings with a generous scoop of hazelnut icecream smack dab in the middle of this beautiful plate....The flavors...oh..the flavors were outstanding. I literally went crossed eyed from pure joy when I took the first bite and was so sad when it was over. Huge calorie bomb for sure but this was worth every single bite.The C'Wow did not excite me as much and I found it to be overly sweet but if you're a fan of chocolate and caramel, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. I can't write anymore because I'm now very distracted with my memories of my amazing dessert....Sorry Yelp!A+ for amazing service, a great concept, and phenomenal desserts. I will be back!"

The presentation of desserts are lovely, they are instagram worthy. The desserts here are just average. The portion of ice cream in the C'WOW is extremely little. There is barely any ice cream inside. There was also brownies and waffles inside. The brownie was delicious but the waffles tasted hard and stale. This chocolate dome was drizzled with caramel. The caramel was extremely sweet. I would recommend that if you were to order this dessert you should ask the waiter to drizzle less caramel on it. The second thing we ordered was the sushi crepe. The sushi crepe was just a regular crepe with banana thats rolled into the shape of sushi. It came with a side of nutella. But i felt like they did not give enough nutella. It only came in a little bowl on the side. We've noticed that the sushi crepe ordered by the people next to us came with chopsticks but ours did not. Which kinda defeated the purpose of sushi crepe. It was just like eating a regular crepe. We also ordered the Banana Nutella milkshake in a manson mug. Presentation of this was nice but the milkshake tasted mostly like banana and lacked nutella flavour. Food: Average, but presentation is nicePrice: Pricey, 3 desserts here is the price of a meal somewhere else.Service: Was good, the waiter was well educated about the menu and was able to give opinions and recommendations."

Dry, brittle, and way overpriced. My boyfriend and I had their regular waffles, and I can assure everyone here that it is better to go buy a box of Eggo waffles from the grocery store and call it a night. They were horrible. First of all, I would think that a 10$ waffle would be bigger than the size of the palm of my hands. But no, they were tiny and barely edible. No exaggeration... They shouldn't even serve this!

The pistachio gelato was made with real ingredients and you can even see tiny pistachio bits here and there. The caramel was not too sweet and the bitterness of the chocolate complimented the overall sweetness of the dessert. I would give the place 5 stars but the service was poor so I had to nick off a star. It took us a while to get our order in because the 4 servers on the floor were not paying attention to the tables (we weren't the only table dissatisfied with the service).

The soufflé mixed with the chocolate and ice cream was exactly what I wanted and needed at that moment. However I was a bit disappointed at the small amount of chocolate I got since I saw in other pictures they serve a bigger amount on the side.

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"SO. MUCH. CHOCOLATE.  That is how you summarize a trip to C'chocolat in one sentence.  As the title suggests this place is a paradise for chocaholics serving up chocolate-based drinks (alcoholoc and non-alcoholic) and chocolate-based desserts.  We were here because my friend had won a contest which entitled us to some free chocolate goodness.C'chocolat is located right down and has only been around about four months or so.  The interior is fairly small and simple.  There is even a photo booth with a tablet rigged up to it so you and your friends can take a selfie.For the adults in the crowd consider getting a choctail which is chocolate cocktail.  Being a cold winter night I thought I would get the C'Aztec because it was served hot.  This contained hot chocolate, vanilla cinnamon Baileys, Sailor Jerry and chili powder.  I liked how it was more savory than sweet and it was very soothing considering outside it was quite cold.The dome is quite literally a dome of chocolate.  When it was served to us our waitress then poured hot chocolate over it melting it away to reveal the contents which were fruit, chunks of waffles and brownies, caramel and ice cream.  The ice cream flavour depends on which one you choose.  Sharing the dome among two people is a good idea.  While the portion size might not seem that big it is very sweet which will make eating a whole one very challenging.  I found it a little too sweet for my liking but the individual components like the brownies were quite good.Service-wise it as pretty good.  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job of making recommendations for us.  While one of the drinks were were brought was wrong she was quick to correct the mistake when it was brought to her attention.  She also left us the drink we hadn't ordered if we wanted to try it at no extra charge.The prices are what you would expect to pay for downtown.  Like I said we got our food for free but in looking at the menu the prices seemed reasonable.  Most of the desserts were between $7 and $15 which is what you would expect to pay for the neighbourhood.All I know is that after my first visit here I need to go back to try out more of their menu offerings.  There was loads of other items on the menu that sounded very enticing including S'mores.  Anyways I definitely want to get back here if I can help it!"

Definitely a no.The chocolate soufflé was more like chocolate syrup. Only the top was baked and the rest was completely liquid. Vanilla ice cream on the side was crazy sweet, very cloying taste, not rich but watery consistency.The crepe part of the peanut butter crepe concoction was supposedly very thick and not good, although I didn't taste that one. Crepe was also supposedly very dry.Three desserts, three cappuccinos and one small Pellegrino cost $56 +tip. I wouldn't mind, but when we decide to go out for a treat, we want to actually have it taste like a treat.

Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share."

We walked in and immediately we were hit with this dank, bitter smell. Definitely not the smell of chocolate. We sat down and the smell didn't improve. Other than that, our waitress was extremely nice. The c'Wow was pretty good. At first, it looked better than it tasted, but after a while it really grew on us.Overall, not sure where I stand on this place."
/user_details?userid=TQ9kiGDwRzE7tRtVFjCkWQ,Mike S.,"Paramus, NJ",5 star rating,"This was a great find during our trip to Montreal. We decided to get the giant chocolate dome they drizzle hot caramel on. It's their signature item and for good reason. The caramel melts and mixes with the hard dome of chocolate and it all forms a decadent pool for all the inside goodies which consist of gelato, brownie pieces hazelnuts and pralines, strawberries and blackberries. My only complaint would be that there could be a few more items thrown inside however I think the portion was good. It is so decadent you would probably get sick eating too much of it.Another guest in our party tried the hazelnut gelato over a waffle and it was also very good. The gelato was made well and the waffle was freshly made on the spot.The greatest asset to this establishment is the commitment to quality ingredients. They do not cheapen the experience by throwing in snickers bars and trying to pretend like they invented something. In a town with a surprisingly low amount of ice cream places, this place was a great find!"

I immediately felt overwhelmed by all the choices on the menu. Everything looked delicious. We had a very kind waiter who was very patient with his confused clients and helped us make our decision. I had the ""C' wow"" chocolate bomb which was a really fun and tasty experience. It is basically a chocolate dome that is melted by having hot chocolate sauce poured on top. Inside you find little treats like brownies, strawberries etc... While I really enjoyed this, I much rather preferred my friend's dessert which was the cheesecake waffle with gelato on a cone. It was by far the best dessert I have had in a while. While it can be pricey, it is definitely a fun experience.

The menu has a lot of choice, the variety of hot chocolates definitely being a highlight!We ordered different types of waffles and crepes with various fruit fillings. To our surprise, the portions were extremely small for the price we paid (similar prices to its competitors)... Even if two people wanted to share, it was too small unlike other places where you get a full waffle, here you are only given a piece of waffle! Maybe it has been aimed at the more diet conscious but for someone who was looking forward to a big treat, this was very disappointing and did not meet the expectations I had of this place.Taste wise it is delicious like most of the other chocolate places but I think I will be sticking to those places in future :)"

It was the perfect balance of dark chocolate to fruit, gelato, and waffle bites. Plus it makes for a cool video to see the chocolate melt before your eyes. The meal was a little more expensive than I'd have liked, but since it was great, I can't really complain. I'd recommend trying a dessert here at least once, at least for the experience."

I was worried that maybe the taste wouldn't be great, as the Instagram famous foods are usually underwhelming but this was an exception. We opted for a scoop of hazelnut ice cream (you have a choice between quite a few flavours) and it was DELICIOUS!

The fragrant aroma of chocolate hit me instantly and put an immediate smile on my face. If you are looking for dessert, I highly recommend coming here. They had a special dessert that looked like a chocolate dome and they drizzled hot caramel on top that melted the dome to uncover gelato underneath (I spied this from across the way and vowed to return with my husband to experience it first hand). Talk about beauty, creativity, and entertainment on one plate. Unless you have an insatiable sweet tooth, I recommend sharing. The portions are huge and the sweetness is, well, a rush of sugar. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wanted to order everything on the menu. Instead, I opted for the staple crepe topped with strawberries, bananas, drizzled with Nutella and a side of vanilla gelato. When the order arrived, I felt like I was on an episode of ""I'll have what Phil's having"" (if you haven't seen it, it's on Netflix and pure joy). In the states, places like this would have a line out the door for hours, seriously, hours. This place was convenient to enter, immediately sit at a table, and order.

Now that they added the Hong Kong style egg bubble waffle to their menu I wanted to try them. I ordered Snow White crepe and Hazelnut Dream waffle and Pretty in Pink bubble waffle:- they claim the bubble waffles to be ""both airy and crisp"" but it wasnt the case. I am pretty sure the normal waffle and the bubble one are made of tye same batter. This makes the bubble waffle too thick and not crispy at all. Being a Hong Kongnese, I can tell you that the insides of a bubble waffle is not supposed to have a bublly surface. I took a picture of it after eating the toppers. - the bubble waffles were soggy after 10minutes and it is not supposed ro happen if they were crispy - the crepe and the waffle are delicious and I would definitely return to try more flavors-the service was so so. After she took my order the food took a while to come and I understand because the platting is important. Then she gave me the 2 first dishes and shortly after the 3rd plate. At that time, she is already checking if the food was fine but i didn't even have the chance to eat them yet..... That was the one and only time she checked on my table. The service could be better as i wanted to tell her that the bubble waffle was really disspointed.- the price was normal for a dessert place. Comparabke to Juiliette et Chocolat."

We were pretty set on ordering that when we got there, but we definitely got confused after reading the menu. We were between the C'Wow or those cool waffles. Ultimately, we decided to go with what had drawn us in in the first place and ended up with the C'Wow.

/user_details?userid=zzKsgIF472IyDpJxmHDIpw,Rana E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Taste was not bad but not amazing either, compared to other places. Very large portions, so eat a light dinner/lunch beforehand if you want to come here for desert.All the dishes looked very pretty, and some very childisly over dressed.Service was excellent, very friendly and comfortable staff, and clean bathrooms.I ordered the Rocky Mountain waffles (not bubble waffles)Waffle itself was way too soft, and had no crisp to it at all :( just mushy like a cake.Happy that they used mini marshmallows, except they didn't toast all of them, so many of them were still uncooked and not gooey, so a bit pointless. Though the ones that were toated were great.Some of the bananas were brown, which was gross and unapetizing :(They should have at least coated their banana slices with something to prevent them from browning. Their salted caramel sauce and white chocolate sauces did not stand out much, and couldn't really notice their flavours. I mistook the white chocolate drizzle for being a dimmed down version of condensed sweetened milk, because it really did not scream white chocolate at all.The idea of adding cachew nuts sounds nice, but really was not nessesary in this dish, because their only positive role I could notice was that they at least gave the dish a different texture which was crunch, and that could have been accomplished with any type of crushed nuts, therefore this queen of the nuts felt underwhelming and added a useless expense.The brownie chunks themselves were fine, just more of a garnish.Though I still felt the way this dish was constructed was all together underwhelming, however it was at least not overly sweet. Although for their prices, I was expecting something more phenominal.If I were to make this at home (which come on, not hard), I would have make a nice airy thick CRISPY waffle (d'uh, crispy outside and slightly softer inside), and make a thin brownie square to put ontop (not heavy so the waffle under wouldn't have time to get soggy), leaving that nice crispy top layer of cooked brownie that happens in the oven, which was absent here, and made the inside of the brownie more goey fudgy and less cake-like. Then I would add THIN slices of just half or a quarter of a banana, no more is needed. Their thick chunks of banana around the plate was not very pleasing for a 13$ dish... Sprinkle some crushed nuts (any lol even peanuts would have been fine, or hazelnuts ). Then I'd drizzle just the caramel with a bit more of a sea salt kick to it, and then added an even layer of marshmallows ontop so they could toast evenly, and not unevenly due to them piling them ontop and scattered around the plate the way they did. The white chocolate (or their other chocolate options) was really not needed at all because there was already too many other flavours that covered it up.Even if they had replaced the cachews with crushed up peanut brittle, that would have been much more memorable, and something I wouldn't want to do at home myself, and would want to go out for.The only thing that makes me feel more at ease for paying this price, is that they make their own ingredients, so it's not cheap factory made chocolates. That makes me happy, though with all their interesting quality ingredients they have, they could use more creativity in putting them together to help them compliment eachother more. Their menu looks very exciting. They even have arabic and mexican inspired items, as well as some more rare ones too, so this deffinetely seems interesting and I wish them good luck."

When we first entered there was no hostess, no one greeted us even though they seen us enter.  It took about 5 minutes for the servers to greet and seat us.  The service was alright. The server was able to recommend us a few different types of desserts. We ordered the famous C'wow, the chocolate dome. When the server brought the dessert. They do not leave you with the hot caramel to pour on yourself at your pace. They allow you to pour it yourself but they would stand there and wait for you. It makes you feel pressured as they are watching you take pictures of the dessert and waiting for you to drizzle the hot caramel over the chocolate dome. The amount of caramel the server pour on top of the dome was a little too much for my liking. It was really sweet and sticky. Inside the dome there is waffles, brownie and a scoop of gelato of your choice. The waffle inside the dome is really hard and dry.  The brownies inside were good though. The gelato, we ordered hazelnut. It was good but the scoop of ice cream was really small. We also ordered the Manson mug milkshake. The milk shake didn't have enough Nutella flavour, tasted mostly like banana. The last thing we ordered was the sushi crepes. They were  good but it's nothing special. I feel like this place is only good as a one time thing. As it is overpriced.  The dessert cost like a price of a meal. But it is Instagram worth. As for cleanliness the store is pretty neat and tidy but the washroom not so much.  There are small black flies on the washroom walls. They were not food flies, they are bigger than food flies. Overall, will not come again. Everything is pretty average tasting."

The orange themed lounge with it's comfortable and attractive booth seats and chairs allows you to enjoy the dining experience with your five senses!

You cannot go wrong ordering almost anything from their delicious menu. Although this place serves popular desserts such as crepes, waffles, and chocolate pizzas, the taste that these items offer is beyond ordinary. Each item comes with a unique twist in the taste and the presentation. Furthermore, the menu reflects ""delicious"" creativity! I mean, they have nutella sushi, chocolate dome, and mouth-watering fondues! Their hot and cold beverages are also a must-try (I LOVE the C'Nuts hot chocolate with 70% of chocolate topped with marshmallows and diced almonds  ).The taste of their chocolate is heavenly and it will surely be the most memorable and euphoric experience for your taste buds! If you prefer savory dishes, the menu has some excellent variety of choices and my personal favourite is the C'Shish Taouk. I can proudly say that I'm a loyal customer to this place and what keeps me returning is the consistency of food quality and excellent service. In sum, C'Chocolate truly redefines the chocolate eating experience and I encourage everyone reading this review to try it out ;)"

When we arrived we were lucky to get seated right away. The place was packed for a Sunday evening, which probably meant that the food was good.Service was good, both waiters were very nice and always checking up on us.We ordered the s'mores and one of the bubble waffles. Food was good but extremely sweet (as expected). If you are into really sweet stuff you would like it. We couldn't handle one plate each, I'd recommend ordering one and sharing. Overall the food was good. Would recommend!"

The Rocky Mountain Waffle sounded really awesome but then nobody came to my table for about 10-15 minutes, I was seated on the patio and the place wasn't even busy. I can't understand why nobody would come over and take my order, lots of eye contact was made and nothing was done. I'll never return to this place again, something so simple and nothing"

I couldn't decide what to order as I was not familiar with the offerings.  Once I settled one the Peanut Butter S'mores it was one of the most delicious unique dessert experiences you could ask for.  The chef is incredibly professional and pumps out amazing chocolate delights that taste as good as they look.  I wish there was such a place in the U.S.  I will return next time I come back to Montreal.

Most people come here for their dessert. My family and I had a Oreo cheesecake milkshake, a red velvet milkshake and a banana milkshake, a pasta crepe with gelato, a strawberry crepe with gelato,  a plain Nutella crepe with gelato, and a tiramisu hot chocolate. We could not stop ordering food. My favorite ones were the Oreo milkshake and the pasta crepe. I can give some credit to the presentation of the food and the way it is prepared. We had the cutest milkshakes and everything was so pretty and mouthwatering. I really recommend this place!!!!"

It was huge and I forced myself to eat every last bite because of how amazing it was. I took off a star because of lackluster service.

Ingredients seemed to be cheap and possibly pre-made...given how quickly my order arrived, I'm guessing that's a solid assumption. The brownie tasted like something you'd buy at a gas station when your blood sugar is low - it has sugar but absolutely no taste. The ice cream tasted like ice w sugar - no cream. And, the ""crepe"" tasted like almost nothing. Sorry to say - not worth the visit."

I heard a lot about the C'WOW and wanted to see it with my own eyes.Super kind waitress, I made her repeat 3 times the ice cream options (oops haha)We ordered the C'WOW, soufflé, hot chocolate and Tea. The C'WOW is incredible to watch haha. When chocolate melt chocolate to reveal more chocolate, exciting moment right there. There were fruits, waffle, ice cream (pistachio I chose :D) and caramel. The soufflé is really small and it came with ice cream, a crazy caramel food art and some ""dipping"" chocolate (2 options to choose from).The hot chocolate was fancy. It comes with a shot of chocolate. It's like the idea of a sake bomb. You put the shot in the middle and pour hot chocolate in.Thumbs up for their Food art and creativity! Fun experience!Omg the jasmine pearl dragon tea helped a lot. I am a tea person and without the tea I don't think I can handle that much chocolate haha.Overall amazing experience. Unique. Food art.

/user_details?userid=pzVIvGv_MmcDlpRTqJt9Mg,K L.,"Cambridge, Canada",5 star rating,"I was in Mtl for 3 nights. Had the souffle the first night and the c'wow the second night. Tried to go back the 3rd night but was too late. Definitely worth going to Mtl for. The deserts were deeelicious. still licking my lips thinking of the deserts. Regret not being able to have tried everthing on their menu. I've seen variations of the C'wow on the internet, pouring the sauce to melt the crust, so this was an experience that did not disappoint. The hot caramel sauce with the melted chocolate dome crust and the brownie inside made it gooey sweet, but the gelato and fruits inside helped to temper the sweetness of the chocolate. It was like a fondu.C'ChoColat was conveniently located in downtown MTL, on Bishop street and open till 11 or 12 at night. I definitely recommend this place for dessert."

The waiter who waited on my friend and I was incredibly hyper, funny, and hip, engaging us in fun, relatable conversations regarding how badly we want to just devour everything they have, and how DIFFICULT it is to choose what we want to have!! He was extremely kind and did not hold back, breaking the ice right away and made being in the restaurant sooooo enjoyable and it felt like we were at ease! There were many choices from meals to desserts to beverages and the prices were affordable and was so worth it for the portion they gave us! The dessert I chose was the Black Jack, which was a bubble waffle, a scoop of chocolate gelato, whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and you get to choose between milk, half and half, or dark chocolate to drizzle atop the dish. I recommend half and half or milk, the dark chocolate starts to become very bitter towards the end and acidic for your taste buds, or just mine. For the whopping dish, it was 13$, I mean, to me, that's a SWEET deal! Like c'mon! Gelato itself is like 5$ a scoop! My friend got the White Chocolate Crumble, and he very much enjoyed it, I cannot say much about it since I figured his portion was small, I won't deprive him of any bit of it! He thoroughly enjoyed it, but then again, he's pretty easy going as long as it's food (same bro, same)!"

I went with a friend and we each got one of their dessert cocktails, the Red Velvet and Blackberry Mojito. The presentation was fun, and the flavors were sophisticated, not just sweet on sweet on sweet. They give you large straws, so whether you go milkshake or smoothie, they're easy to drink/eat. And the presentation just has such a stupendous wow factor! We'd been tearing up the downtown, checking out bars and restaurants but this was an easy favorite. The staff was efficient and enthusiastic, the menu was full of pictures that are just scandalous food porn. And the drinks are so inventive, delicious, and beautiful they're well worth the price.

/user_details?userid=MCdgzhntTVK0OEH0ivqpEw,Stuart ..,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,Lots of choice at this chocolate spot.  I even saw some people eating green things.  They may have been vegetables I ordered the a bubble waffle which I found to be quite large.  Tasty with lots of chocolate sauce and delicious strawberries.  My wife ordered the souffle which does take about 15 minutes to prep.  They do warn you so that you are not left sitting there wondering what's up.  I would recommend that if you order a coffee and want it with your souffle that you mention it.  Our coffees came out right away and as a result I was finished my espresso before our dishes arrived.  Not a big deal.  The chilled water went well with the heavy chocolate dish.

We waited over 1h for the waitress to come see us.  Needless to say that there was a couple right next to us who got served and got to pay fairly quickly.  The waitress could have turned around and ask if we needed anything else but it's as though we didn't exist.  I even called her while she was right next to me and she totally didn't pay attention to me."

It's very small but I hear they're expanding. Some alcoholic drinks are offered too, including dessert kinds. Wifi was password protected and we never found out what that password was"

I wanted to like this place. The concept is nice and I love desserts. The service was already bad and on top of that the food was not great either. My partner ordered the banana Nutella shake and Rocky Mountain waffle. I got the matcha matcha man mason jar (milkshake). My partner's waffle was ok, nothing amazing. The banana Nutella shake was so not worth it. And my matcha matcha man milkshake was only good on the first 2 sips, the rest of the shake was bland. I guess it was not blended well. The macaron on top of it and the ""matcha"" crumble did not even taste like matcha. The waitress that we got seemed like the only one really working, the other waiter on the floor was barely doing anything. I would not come back."

They cooked the bread for the sandwich in a waffle iron and it was soft, perfectly baked and delicious. The ingredients were fresh and avocado sauce tied the whole sandwich together. The dish came with a side salad that complemented the sandwich really well. There was also a fruit kebab with milk chocolate sauce and coffee, which rounded off the meal perfectly.

The restaurant can get packed and sometimes you might have to wait for a free table but not for so long! Staff are really friendly! I've had the red velvet milkshake, which was amazing!!! Their milkshakes are served in a mason jar on a chopping board, with cute toppings and decorations such as candy. I also had their Golden Ticket milkshake which was a very chocolaty milkshake topped with cotton candy and other candies, and more candy on the chopping board! I loved both milkshakes! I've also had their chocolate ball where they poured some sort of chocolate syrup over it which melted the ball and inside it was one scoop of gelato (of your choice) with brownies and pieces of waffles and fruits around it, it was amazing, i was kinda disappointed that it was only one small scoop of gelato. I also had their chocolate pasta, yes chocolate pasta!! It was pasta with with chocolate sauce, sprinkled with whites chocolate as the cheese and bits of brownies, with a scoop of gelato in the middle! It was so good, I never knew pasta and chocolate would make a good combo!! I love this place so much! I yet still have to try their savoury dishes!!"
