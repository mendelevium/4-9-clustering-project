I had been intrigued about it every time a passed it by on the street. The ever changing menu and decor are promising. However, when I went with my friend the atmosphere was off. It seemed hollow and didn't have enough character. The appetizer we chose was too expensive for what it was. It was simply fresh mozzarella on a bed of raw veggies. It did taste good I'll give it that. We waited so long for our mains that even tipsy on wine we noted it to each other. Plus the resto was empty, which was concerning. My bavette came lukewarm. For the wait I didn't expect that. It was just ok as well. For the price of this restaurant on Masson I believed the food and experience would be amazing. Unfortunately, it did not deliver."

Their brunch menu is small, consists of 5 dishes. I like that, it makes the choice easier and tells you that they are putting dedication into each dish. I had the smoked salmon, squash & poached egg with hollandaise and it was fantastic. My partner had the french toast and it was also very very very tasty. The reason I am taking off a star is, unfortunately, for the portions. My 18$ meal was no more than 4 bites. Four delicious bites, but four 18 dollar bites nonetheless. And my partner's french toast had but a half slice of thin bread on the plate for 15$. There was a little mix-up in the kitchen, and they promptly made up for it before we even said anything with a slab of delicious chocolate chunky banana bread, which I consider to be great service. So... Food is great, service is great, atmosphere is great, location on Masson is great but the quantity-price (something I very seldom complain about) is terrible. Add another piece of french toast, guys!"
