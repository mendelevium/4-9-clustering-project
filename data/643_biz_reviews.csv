/user_details?userid=jbgGoTl11dDpcw0IYeL58g,Laurene A.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"This is an excellent hidden Spanish gem in Montreal! We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night, and when we arrived they had only one large group seated, and one other couple. They had a live flamenco dancer, but we unfortunately could not see her from where we were seated, which was little disappointing. There were four of us, and we decided to order a pitcher of sangria, which seemed to take an awfully long time to arrive considering there were only two other tables there, but it was VERY good none the less. Not strong at all, and very easy to drink. We ended up ordering a second pitcher during dinner. We chose to order the tapas platter, a soup, and the mussels to start. We had asked for the variety of 6 tapas, but received 3, plus a dish of legumes, which was very good still. The broth of the mussels was so delicious, and the bread accompaniment was perfect for soaking it up. The server was extremely nice, and spoke English, French and Spanish. It was getting a little late and he sugegsted if we wanted paella, to place the order before it got too late, and instead of bringing the menu back, he simply asked what our preferences were and suggested each couple share one paella, which was a very, very smart choice!!! We had the seafood paella, which had a split lobster, lobster tail, scallops, clams, shrimp and squid in it. It absolutely delicious!!!! The menu is a bit pricey, and we felt a little rushed to leave at the end, and after getting back to our hotel we realized they mischarged our appetizers and we were way over-charged. So I would definitely check the bill before you cash out! Our bill for 4 people was $270, but the food was amazing, the restaurant was very cute, and we had a great time, so it was well worth it!"

/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're in the mood for some good tapas, ambiance, and later in the evening a show thrn this is the place for you.We were feeling a bit peckish after an evening of board-gaming so my friend and I stopped by the place because they had tapas. Neither of us was hungry enough for a full course meal and neither of us wanted more pub food so the promise of little plates spoke to us.We threw caution to the wind and ordered the tapas for two plus a plate of grilled octopus.I got a glass of house red.The octopus was perfectly grilled and was very tender. Delicious!The tapas for two consisted of Chorizo, squid, and little croquettes that were basically happy little fishcakes. Again, delicious!We lingered over the starters and wine and were then surprised when a guitarist and a flamenco dancer took to the stage.  While the show disrupted our conversation we were content to take in the sights and sounds of Spanish culture. The audience, made of young and old alike were appreciative of the show and showed it with hearty applause at the end of the set.Service was warm, friendly, and welcoming and the plates came quickly.  We couldn't have asked for better."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh wow! This family-owned restaurant is definitely worth every star of this rating.The atmosphere and the decor makes you feel like you're visiting a restaurant in Spain. I almost forget that I'm in Montreal for a while. They have 2 floors and they have flamenco show downstairs every weekend. The food is amazing and their paella is very generous on seafood. It is a little bit pricey than your average restaurant, but such a great spot that you must visit it at least once. It's perfect for groups, a special date or family dinners. So, if you're a fan of Spanish food, I'd definitely recommend to pay a visit to this place."

/user_details?userid=RCB1ULUa6VQxyOp809gE7g,Sergio G.,"Gatineau, Canada",4 star rating,"I might have found that restaurant that fills a bit of the gap I have, being Spanish and missing Spanish food.All my previous tries in Ottawa were disappointing, to say the least. A bit of culinary history:Galicia is a province in the North West of Spain, right above Portugal, and right beside Asturias (where I come from). Galicia is famous within Spain for its white wines (Albariño or Ribeiro) and for its seafood. The coast of Galicia is in the Atlantic Ocean, and the seafood is simply amazing.Now, Casa Galicia tries not only to represent Galicia itself, but the rest of the country as well, that is why the main dish they serve is, of course, paella.Now, knowing the owner is from Galicia, I obviously had some advantage there when it came to ordering our food. I chose Seafood paella. If someone knows how to do a seafood paella, those are the people from Galicia.It serves two people and, listen to this, it includes two appetizers, dessert and coffee, all that for 90$!!!In Spain it's quite common to order the ""daily menu"" which basically consist of an appetizer, a main dish, dessert, coffee and drink, for about 8-12 euros. Each restaurant would have two or three options for appetizer and another two or three for the main dish. Oh, yeah, and they change daily, so you can go to the same restaurant every day and yet, eat something different in the daily menu.Casa Galicia represented that quite well, including appetizer and dessert in the price.I chose Gazpacho ( cold tomato soup)' and they brought little pieces of fried bread for me to throw into the soup, just like at home!The atmosphere is cozy, since it is not a big restaurant. And of course, dinner was accompanied by a flamenco show! My hands were hurting after clapping so much.I strongly recommend to stop by Casa Galicia if you want to feel like you are in Spain for one night."
/user_details?userid=jImKbs4In8xg5c73Gb0NTQ,Eric C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This charming Spanish restaurant discreetly located in quartier latin served the best seafood paella I had, better than the few places I went while in Spain. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good variety of seafood. I was early so the place was quiet with few customers; it would get more festive when there is a flamenco show. Be sure to reserve and bring your date; intimate and romantic interior is sure to please your partner."

/user_details?userid=sD909FAwLdbKvNRQkjurrw,Robert S.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,I've been to Montreal several times and this was my first time trying Casa Galicia - it is now my favorite place to eat so far in all the years I've been visiting Montreal - ;) merci !!
/user_details?userid=wRdRHUyVuaPR2IGnvDfyKw,Sergio M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went for paella and we were greatly disappointed. Their bread was not fresh and the garlic bread was burned. The paella, well it was not paella. Its normal rice (for paella one has tu use a special kind of rice) with tomato sauce and they put it in the oven. It had no saffron and the taste was plain. I would not recommend it."
/user_details?userid=tHE5n7loFv0zMuCyTcDEiw,Jazzlyn G.,"York, PA",5 star rating,"This is one of the best Spanish restaurants I've ever been to. The paella was delicious and the red sangria was amazing. The waiter was attentive and friendly and we felt very comfortable in the restaurant. This was our first time in Montreal, and if we come back we'd definitely come here again."
/user_details?userid=gYX8SA8SmLE0CC7PJMuEeQ,Maz C.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,Bit on expensive side but food quality is awesome. I tried their flagship Paella (lamb and seafood) it was the most delicious Spanish food I ever had.
/user_details?userid=Cz0VoUOaGPfqcY6kVmvo4g,Connoisseuse B.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,I'd eaten at Casa Galicia Astoria NY many times before so had great expectations for the Montreal rest. But what a letdown! The shrimps in garlic sauce tasted as though they were quickly dipped in some kind of tomato/ garlic sauce mix then heated up. The seafood paella was equally terribly done and terrible tasting. The kir royale was nothing like the French version but the meal still cost easily $100. By far the worst food I've had in a very long time!

/user_details?userid=8Q10whUR5XS51J_eaTaNzA,Steven K.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Stopped by on a whim last night for some flamenco and tapas. It was like a trip back to olde Europe. This place has been around since the 1980's but the owners and employees act like it's a new business.  The service and smiles were welcoming.  We saw a Flamenco show that while not the best ever, was entertaining and enjoyable and added a nice touch to a fun evening of tapas and wine.  I'm happy this place exists - the food was delicious - grilled Octopus and other tapas were authentic, fresh and tasty.  True to Galicia - the menu features lots of great seafood options.  Go and enjoy a trip to old Espana."
/user_details?userid=cHnvAwZg50AgoZBwXG5RAw,Holly P.,"Burlington, VT",2 star rating,"A friend recommended Casa Galicia so I was counting on an pretty great evening.  Unfortunately it was a total disappointment as the food was pretty mediocre, the service so-so and very over-priced for what it was. We enjoyed the flamenco and the guitar performance but I would not go back."
/user_details?userid=WKRKJ9-sF-cekpX1ciOIjg,Dave S.,"Brunswick, ME",4 star rating,"I was prepared to conclude that this place is a typical tourist trap that has mediocre food at terrible prices.  Thankfully, I was rather far off base.  We went here on a recent Saturday and got there very early (5:15pm).  We were the only table, but that didn't deter us.The interior is a little bit dated, but not in a bad way.  We liked it.  The server was very helpful and had several good suggestions of tapas to order.  We sampled many things, each of which was good.  The gazpacho was a standout: acidic, spicy, and hearty.  Just perfect.  The garlic shrimp, which is very easy to mess up, was done nicely.  The wine selection was excellent and well-priced.  We'll likely return here on our next trip to Montreal."
