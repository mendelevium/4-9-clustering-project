/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I come here to have a sushi pack for 2 or 3 people at least twice a month. The chef makes his own choice and he is never wrong. You can chose, but you'll should leave this job to the pros. This food is fresh, delicious, and made with the authentic Japanese technique. The owner, Mr. Lee, is one of the most passionate, committed and polite chefs out there. Some of the warmest persons in Montreal work here.I usually have sushi to-go, so I recommend you give him a call before you get there so the food is ready. Once there you'll understand when you percieve people just walking in here, they'll greet the chef like a friend, they'll pay their food and take it out running.So I recommend the packs which include hosomakis, futomakis and sushi. From 12 to 63 pieces. Portions are precise, but you can always mention to the chef how hungry you are."

/user_details?userid=PqI494Hy7C3hZIVaGpc2vg,Emy P.,"St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada",5 star rating,"Izusushi is one of my favorite sushis restaurant on Montreal island. Their sushis are always fresh and tasty. Unique creations are available there such as Rachel, which is a mix of spicy tuna, tempura, avocado, apple and ginger.I've been there many times and always been completely satisfied with what I ordered and the service. Staff is friendly, fast and convenient."

And I love the huge array of rolls, and the delicious, fresh ingredients. Not to mention - the owner is without a doubt the nicest person!"

The restaurant itself was cute and decently sized! If we come back to Montréal, we will definitely be sure to come back to this sushi restaurant!"

/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hidden away on Rachel Street, there lies Izu sushi,let's get the interior out of the way first: it blows, just a couple of tables and some chairs strewn about, the bare minimum so you can recognize a facsimile of a restaurant.Onto the good stuff, they have a large selection of creative maki rolls, with soya rolls, regular rolls and rice paper rolls. Their take on the standard sushi rolls will have to wait.The sushi is fresh and prepared on the spot, the rolls are a good size and quite flavorful, the Miso soup had a lemony tinge and the salad had a good amount of seafood in it.The prices are a bit too high and they don't seem to have any 8 piece medium Maki Rolls, which I found odd.But if this is the worst I can say about the place, then it's not a bad place to get sushi."
/user_details?userid=2_mSppyp2y08wUTrVPKnNg,Dani S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The owner here is great! So helpful and friendly and just a sweet guy. There is a lot to choose from which I love and some niceCombos too. We took the food to go and did not stay to eat at the restaurant itself, it is very bare in there and made it feel a bit uncomfortable. The food came out really quick, almost too quick, because I'm not sure how fresh four rolls can be if they came out in probably less than 10 minutes. So food I would give 3/5 and service would be 5/5. I'm glad I tried Izu but I know there are better sushi joints around."

/user_details?userid=CHhZ5AlZDzfklVl3jC8fqA,Brandon H.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"It's my best friend Patrick's birthday, and we wanted some real quality Japanese food, so my other friend, Dean, did some research. He came up with Izu, and we decided to give it a try. The sushi shop is relatively small and unassuming, not lavishly decorated like some of it's close by contemporaries. Instantly, Howard, who we assume to be the owner, eagerly welcomed us. We decided to intrust him with a randomly picked combo, and he graciously provided us with a refreshing wakame salad. From our table, we could see the sushi being made, a fact which tortured us and tantalized us, but mesmerized us all the same. The sushi was simply delicious, a delightful variety. Just great sushi. I'd recommend the place, frankly. Happy bday pat"
