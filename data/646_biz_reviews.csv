We experienced very customized and attentive service by the owner who patiently answered our questions and offered great suggestions. We had the vegetarian mezze and all the dishes were super tasty (especially the falafels and the baba ganouj). For dessert, we had a custard with pistachio and rose water: it was amazing, very flavourful and not too sweet (and imagine our delight when we found out it was on the house, wow!)Highly recommended."

/user_details?userid=PtKfq5BQPhHpbuKyYLEY1w,Barbara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious food with that home-made Middle Eastern taste.  The server/owner was very gracious and helpful and made us feel very welcome.  The Fattoush salad had wonderful dressing, and both humus and baba ghanouj were delicious.  Fried cheese (sanbousek?) was divine, and the Chicken Lilas very tasty was well.  Both the desert, a kind of pudding and baklava, were 10 out of 10.  Don't miss this neighborhood gem that is small and cosy, very clean and inviting, and very reasonable prices as well."
