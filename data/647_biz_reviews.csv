/user_details?userid=jGlHOQ9QySUeon8oXM8zkA,Barjinder S.,"San Rafael, CA",4 star rating,The whole place is Buffet for vegan food. there was a variety of tofu flavor which was really good. The charge you by the weight of plate so be careful do not make a mistake like I did. My plate cost me $28 LOL.
/user_details?userid=GKnzibraWM6S6uajYR8Vbw,Sarah P.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I've never seen anything like it, vegan food and be hard to find, but this place is exactly what I was looking for. Friendly service and great food"
/user_details?userid=vpPC9AFqPSEPeMBnymX47A,Veg V.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"A great veg restaurant set in a beautiful old building, where one can choose from a large buffet and pay by weight upstairs or get some grab-and-go food downstairs. Lots of healthy choices, lots of deliciousness!(And, by the way, right next door is one of the many outlets of Copper Branch, a big veg chain, and across the street is Panthere Verte, a small veg chain; up the block is veg Yuan, veg Sushi Momo, veg Hindusthali, and veg grocery Herbivores, all on St-Denis.)"

/user_details?userid=C46PPnwZeiQlG2o3nb9E_A,Nick T.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Pricey, but the self serve area was pretty worth it at least for the occasional indulgance. An incredible selection of vegetarian dishes- looks beautiful all the different colors on a plate. Had some simple avocados in a sauce that was mind blowing, best avocados I've ever had. Heaven for vegans and vegetarians. Pretty well labeled for things that contain dairy, except for the condiments."
/user_details?userid=LnTkfsxo9QygrPBcIpHMEA,Daniel K.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"Very good vegan food for a very good price. There is vegan everything. The sandwichs and wraps are amazing and the Chia pudding is great too. Will definetly go again. If your looking for good vegan food, look no further. Everything is good."

/user_details?userid=5WdBw9XyBEYi4Dzb4UhvIQ,Jonathan K.,"Westborough, MA",5 star rating,"Really great vegan food with great variety, enjoyable for both vegans and omnivores! The food is pay by weight, so it can get a bit pricey, but its 100% worth it.Make sure to order the vegan pulled pork on the way out!"
/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Nothing looked particularly inviting on St Denis on this day besides this place so decided to give it a shot. The inside is clean and looks like they have wifi since there were a lot of people on laptops. Friendly service too. I tried their soy meat wrap, raspberry brownie and raisin chocolate chip cookie. I'm not a vegetarian but the soy meat actually tasted like real meat (chicken). It was good, nothing outstanding but still good! Their baked goods were pretty satisfying and heavy. I couldn't eat both of them in one seating. Fair prices too."
/user_details?userid=LicyHK-zhYSAIuZvabBLlQ,Matt B.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for vegan sandwiches and other vegan snacks. I ordered the BBQ pull ""pork"" sandwiches, which was very tasty, along with a decent soup. My wife ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was also very tasty. Their soup and sandwich combo ($10++) is a good deal. Friendly staff -- everything is ready quickly, since they just have to heat it up / grill it. They have lots of grab 'n go stuff in the fridge also, including sandwiches, salads, vegan cheeses, and more. Very much recommended."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"We chose two grilled sandwiches from the glass case next to the till. They were...absolutely delicious! No boring tempeh, tofu, or veggie paté taste. Both sandwiches were just perfectly balanced, with intensive flavors and crispy bread. On the side I had a little bowl with beetroot-pear and creamy potato salad which were also both really well prepared.We only realized there was a whole buffet in the back of the restaurant once we saw other people coming out with fully loaded plates. We'll know what to do next time."
/user_details?userid=WmRR_YPFaF84fCaHq4pauw,Isis N.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Vego was my dream come true once we arrived in Montreal. Vegan and vegetarians of the world, rejoice! They have a buffet style, with signs that show the vegan and vegetarians options.Everything was very tasty, fresh and appetizing. And because you pay by the weight, most likely you'll ended up over eating.But it's all good. Guilty free it's my motto since I call myself a vegan."
/user_details?userid=MHhItAE_kpNPDIbKeUJkFg,Betty E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I am a carnivore at heart but after eating at Resto Vego I might be persuaded to go vegan. Not only delicious but colourful. What a pleasant experience!
/user_details?userid=vjMwITU7ypQQ8buAHDVPWg,Ravi D.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Mediocre place with mediocre but overpriced food. I tried this place because I wanted to go meat free for my dinner. This place had good reviews but it fell short on deliverance. They charge you by weight but don't tell you the plate itself weighs around 500 grams, so basically you get charged before you even see or smell the food.The food itself wins on quantity but loses on quality. Everything was bland and blah! The saving grace were the desserts - the carrot cake was delectable and crunchy because of nuts, it was just amazing. The walnut square was also phenomenal. Go to this place but do a take out, that way you save paying for the weight of an empty plate."
/user_details?userid=L5wIQRJEcvT1XpO5OxDxfQ,Elliot P.,"Châteauguay, Canada",3 star rating,"The food from the buffet itself was Good but not more than that. I think it's a little overpriced for what it actually is. There are a lot of vegan options, but if you're like me and you don't eat Gluten either it's a bit more difficult but not impossible. Staff was great and everything is super clean. All together I think I'd go back again but wouldn't go out of my way and make this my top 5 Go-to vegan spots in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=CNenBqsc5HxaC6dfX9SxYg,S. N.,"Brighton, MA",5 star rating,Amazing!!i loved the buffet! You have all kinds of vegetables and fruits in their buffet. A lot of healthy entrées and they list all the ingredients and it's all natural ingredients. Highly recommended. They even have a dessert section which also has to die for selections!
/user_details?userid=ZuvNUKYZKWLRD4xuX84j5Q,Cathy N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A really cool spot for both vegans and vegetarians! Especially in the summer with their cute terrasse.I went twice and grabbed food from the buffet upstairs. You pay by the weight, but as long as you take very small amounts of everything you want, you won't pay too much and will still be able to have a lot of diversity on your plate.Also if you're a salad person, I can totally see how this would be awesome for you, because they have so many items in the salad bar and usually they don't weight a lot compared to more consistent food.The food is tasty and there is always different things to try!"
/user_details?userid=RmxuIIpYDy0AI_Mch4VqjQ,Cherpumple F.,"Baltimore, MD",5 star rating,"This place is delicious! I ""did it wrong"" aka didn't get the buffet, but I ordered the tofu curry sandwich, and it was amazing. The bread, spread, and filling were all on point.Cheap, on a happening street, good people watching."
/user_details?userid=15F8EQWh2P5s-qrx5Axo7w,Dan -.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"As a non-veg I was quite satisfied with Resto Végo, the food was good and the options grand. This is a buffet style restaurant so I had the opportunity to taste many of the various dishes offered here. The food was delicious, the chilli was flavourful, the pasta seasoned well and the vegetables were finely prepared. I'm an amateur when it comes to strictly vegetarian and vegan dishes but if more restaurants served food like this, it would make the idea of being a vegetarian or a vegan much easier. My vegan friend was delighted with the variety available and thoroughly enjoyed his full plate. The food was very filling and neither one of us were able to finish.The restaurant itself is quite comfortable, it carries a very welcoming and green vibe. The staff was kind and the environment clean."
/user_details?userid=hDGDDcgPjAAbDVIW-hFApg,Tony T.,"Oakland, CA",2 star rating,VERY EXPENSIVE. Over $100 CAD for 2 people. However the choices and quality of vegetarian food is excellent.
/user_details?userid=PK3EmRHbtPxxuJuEyHnI5A,Nica D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I like that this place is still around. I hadn't been for a long time and noticed the name change as it used to be Le Commensel before. It seems very much the same in how it operates except the prices have gone up. I like that they do have some variety, however it seems that they often only have small portions of food out and don't always refill it so if you go after lunch or after dinner it can be a little sparse. I do think it'd be nice if they charged less if you come at a time when only some of the food is out and not all of it, just because it can be quite expensive paying by the pound. I'm still not sure why we get free bread and forgot about this until at the checkout and took some anyway. But eating plain bread compared to the other food on my plate just didn't make sense so I left it."
/user_details?userid=38SGzCuqN3mO6vMTiVEX3w,Raphaella R.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here this week and took a sandwich to-go as I was in a rush. I tried the ""Tex-Mex"" sandwich based on a suggestion and it was very good. They have many options to choose from that even non-veg would enjoy. It's a bit pricey for just a sandwich but definitely worth a try. Next time, I would like to try their buffet."
/user_details?userid=pRRxwmabZaEheHTrsl90CA,Audrey L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went there for a late night dessert with my friends and it did not disappoint. They have everything you could ever dream for - from salads to wraps, cupcakes to ice creams, smoothies to coffees - and the setting is oh so homey! I am vegan so I definitely feel like I found my happy place (they advertise what is vegan and what is not, which makes it so much easier for me, and the staff is always available to answer questions about the different items) and there are a lot of tables, you'll always find a spot to eat or just sip on an ice tea while reading a book. The atmosphere is very laid-back and the noise level is ok if you want to study on the ground floor (the buffet is on the upper floor where it's always a bit more crowded). The only downside is the price, like many others who have posted reviews, I feel a bit ripped off, mostly for the buffet. The food and drinks sold on the ground floor are still on the pricier side but nothing you would not see at the closest Starbucks. I definitely recommend the place, even if your wallet might suffer a little."

/user_details?userid=DdTswyo8wwpf2ouIfHIWKA,Millie M.,"Brattleboro, VT",5 star rating,"I'm pretty positive this place has changed their name since I first went here in about 1994. Back then, if you were vegan/vegetarian, you had to look in the back of Vegetarian Times magazine for lists of restaurants. My then boyfriend and I drove up to Montreal for the first time with this being one of the top 3 reasons. We were absolutely stunned and giddy like children that we could eat EVERYTHING, and if we couldn't, it was clearly marked. I love a buffet so I can get a good look at what I'm ordering but also because I can eat a little of everything then go back for the best. Everything is super fresh and the veggies are all brightly colored. The last time I went here was in about 2014 and it had gotten fancy. Not in a ""i feel like i don't belong"" kind of way but in a ""wow, they stepped up the decor and the food and I'm excited"" kind of way.The variety of dishes always gives me ideas on combinations I haven't thought of.I kind of want to drive up there right now. It's not cheap but it's worth every cent."
/user_details?userid=84E1MD_cJjr-rtv292AQCQ,M G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite restaurant. It seems like not a lot of people know about this place though (or at least the buffet part). They have so many choices (hot dishes, cold dishes, salads, soups, desserts, sandwiches and wraps to take on the go, etc.) that it makes me forget they are vegetarian. The buffet style makes it ideal to try a bit of everything. I think the quality of the food is great, and they have a mix of healthy and more ""indulgent"" dishes to satisfy everyone. Definitely recommend you try it!"
/user_details?userid=ERa6tr7SRW2bB6AMYfnntw,Rishy B.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,This is an 'ok' place for vegetarians/vegans but it's too expensive IMHO. The so-called 'buffet ' is by weight so one person may end up eat for over $20. Should offer more 'packages' like an appetizer + entree + dessert.
/user_details?userid=OtV8UYg28PLpoFFdHQvKHw,Talha R.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Tasty, delicious vegetarian food.They have two areas - a cafe and a buffet restaurant. The buffet you pay by the weight of your food.The buffet you get to choose from around 20/25 different dishes. They also have a good collection of desserts.The food is really good - but a bit pricey though."
/user_details?userid=RTr01iR6zp-0r4uBw1aT1w,V P.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,Fantastic find in Montreal! We had a three year old with us and the flexibility here is unbeatable. The options for vegetarians are limitless and the space is large enough both outside and inside. Perfect restaurant for a relaxed lunch! Must-visit for vegetarians visiting Montreal!
/user_details?userid=wAapkfuOdtIMajbFotOY5Q,Marie-Ange A.,"Paris, France",4 star rating,"Nice staff and ambiance, lots of variety in terms of food options, delicious food.A bit awkward to have the buffet upstairs, especially if you sit down stairs. Carrying a tray down narrow stairs, made me nervous.The food is way too expensive, to my liking. I love the food but can only afford to splurge like that once a year, especially on a buffet. Im used to more affordable buffets."
/user_details?userid=fIXHCXGakA3gm_aVJMU73Q,Sarah A.,"VA, VA",4 star rating,"Good options for vegans and vegetarians. Very similar in concept to the Whole Foods hot/salad bar. You pick out your food and then it's weighed -- cafeteria/buffet style. I had a good variety of salads to choose from. I ended up really liking the mini tempeh burger and chickpea marinated salad. The raw goji cheesecake was amazing. No need to pay for water since they have a water fountain in the seating area. No English advertising is up outside, but then all the food is clearly marked in English, French, and with pictures indicating allergens."
/user_details?userid=OAh1W2NqSYkKQuzhpE8Hbw,Christina S.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Really great experience. I came here end of August for lunch with my mom who isn't vegan or vegetarian. She loved the veggie lasagna and guacamole. I tried a multitude of vegan dishes including one noodle dish which was very good. I wish I would have known they have a cut off for price as you pay by weight because I would have ordered more! I'll go back the next time I'm there. Cafeteria-style with each item clearly labelled vegan, veg, gluten free etc.."

I have a black pepper allergy and I noticed that they list most ingredients in their dishes except black pepper. I asked about this, and several of their servers were rude and dismissive. They cater to people who are vegetarians and also avoid dairy, gluten and salt, but it's too much to ask that they also label black pepper!"
/user_details?userid=JKOLgeGQjCH5j8XvNJy3Bg,Ryan W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,the best vegan friendly buffet I have every ever seen.  The patio out back is to die for and best of all the wifi is super fast and free.

I've been eating here for years, but recently ate there daily for three weeks while taking a course at UQAM. The food at the buffet is consistently high quality and clearly labeled. A lot of the dishes fall into the comfort food category, but there are many lighter options as well. There's also a great take-out counter downstairs now. I've found this a handy place to grab a quick salad or veggie wrap (with actual protein inside!) when I've not had time for dining in.I only wish the Toronto location was still open!"

The one thing I know for sure is it is affordable and the quantity and delicious mix of ingredients are filling enough in a good way. Plus, the location on Saint-Denis has an outdoor terrace which is lovely now that summertime is finally here in town!"
/user_details?userid=XPG7ps_Q9iSlxc-fi8py9w,Howard H.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"With all of the other veggie and vegan options in Montreal I just have a tough time getting excited about what's on offer at Le Commensal.  This is essentially a pay by weight buffet/cafeteria and as such suffers from the freshness issue that it endemic to the delivery system.  Le Commensal gets a lot of extra love (in the stars department) because of choice.  Most veg-heads are frequently subjected to a rather frightening level of same-ness in available dining options.  The reason that love doesn't extend past two stars is that although there is variety, quite a bit of it tastes the same and I have yet to have experienced anything worthy of remembering well enough to include in - oh - let's say - a review?I'm at best a demi-vegetarian, but I regularly dine with vegans and am well versed in vegetarian and vegan cooking.  There are many vastly superior options in Montreal.  Please check out my list of Veggies goodness for a better alternative,"
/user_details?userid=IOTZ0XTALPJltFaQNVg4HQ,Amary N.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"A great place to explore vegetarian varieties. It's a vegetarian buffet.  The food is charged by weight (kilos). The ambiance of this place is nice. People who works there are friendly. I have been 2 of their locations. But this is my favorite spot.In North America, I haven't seen a huge variety of vegetarian food quite like Le Commensal. Even non-vegetarians like myself enjoys it. And it's also not cheap."
/user_details?userid=RGEfZEUzJSaoUWcxpWC7cw,k j.,"Young America, MN",5 star rating,"Wow.  So happy this place has an obvious ""vegetarian"" name and a big sign...we stumbled upon it and were so glad!  Buffet is about $13USD/lb, so pricey (but looked good), and has a price cap for a single plate, so good deal fir a big eater.  For bird eaters, get a to-go salad or a deli salad or deli flatbread.  We got 2 salads, a flatbread, and a dessert for $20CDN and wasted half of it, sadly.  Easily could've split a flatbread and a small deli salad.  Very yummy...a Montreal standby if I'm ever lucky enough to be in town again."
/user_details?userid=eIQLLIikPj4tPDPWhcOltg,Joanna M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really excited to go here because, as a vegetarian, I really like being able to go places where I have more than one choice.  Le Commensal has a lot of choices at their buffet and many of them are quite well executed. I enjoyed the ginger tofu and the quinoa salad, but some of the other things were not memorable. The lasagne was just plain bad, so it is a little hit or miss here. All in all, there are some very good things, but it really depends on you to pick the right things to your taste. They had a nice selection of fresh fruits and salad items, as well.It was nice and quiet when we were here, and I think it would be great for groups. I wish it was a little cheaper to my graduate-student-sized wallet."

I prefer the location on St-Denis over the one around McGill, just because of the atmosphere; it doesn't feel as cold and sparse as the other one.The buffet has a good variety of hot and cold foods, as well as some desserts. There's not really anything I would call too exotic on the menu, so with that said, the food here will probably appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, as well as different age groups. Some of the menu items are kind of bland tasting, but others make up for it.Food is priced by weight, which can get a bit confusing, all you can do is eye it and hope it doesn't come out more expensive than you intended. Regardless, the food here is affordable."

Amazing vegan/veg options, many of which are premium and all you can fit on a plate for $15 makes it incredible value, the price by weight option for lighter meals is not expensive either. There is a great mix of healthy and more savoury items in the buffet as well as take away options, desert, alcoholic beverages and fresh or bottled drinks. This would be a good place for non-vegetarian people to see what veg cuisine has to offer. The cute girl at the front was super nice and explained things with a big smile on her face. We ate on the patio outside in the sun and enjoyed the great location. Highly recommended!"

As further explanation to Americans if either of these mean something to you think Souper Salad (RIP!) or Fresh Choice, but more exotic. And better. And with maple syrup pie (drool). There is plenty here for both the I love vegetables vegetarian and the maybe if I close my eyes I can imagine it's a hamburger vegetarian. Watch those eyes in your stomach because you pay by weight, but once you get your plate full head over to the widow and grab a prime people watching spot. Watch the shoppers and business people on the streets below and watch your fellow first time diners plow through their plates stacked 10 inches high. The eyes bigger than the stomach thing."
