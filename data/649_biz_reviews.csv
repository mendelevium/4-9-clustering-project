/user_details?userid=UCQ8aQ0EUvIYoZzIm0xZXw,An G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We dined here last night with our two young kids while touring Old Montreal at the tail end of a one week trip through Quebec.  We booked on OpenTable.  They made a mistake with our reservation, first telling us that they didn't have a reservation under our name.  Once we showed our OpenTable confirmation, they seemed to figure something out and seat us, albeit at a rather odd table at the back of the restaurant. I'm downgrading the rating for this reason. Regardless, the food was excellent and the service was pretty good too.  We ordered the Fuoco pizza with a gluten free base to share between my husband and I, a margarita pizza for the kids, burrata and an order of soppressata.  The gluten free pizza was possibly the best GF pizza I've ever had, which is very high praise given I'm a celiac.  The burrata was so-so but the soppressata was really spicy and delicious.  Our kids enjoyed their pizza too.I'd recommend this place to others without hesitation."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We ordered two pizzas: one pizza per person. They are not very big or heavy (especially the vegetarian ones). We got the prosciutto pizza and the bufala margherita pizza. Enjoyed both of these. The service was average. Our server was quite busy with the bigger group, so was not able to give us as much time. In fact, we wanted to order a dessert and sat there waiting for 15 minutes to get her attention. When we asked the person who brought our food about the dessert, he told us to wait for our server. LOL. After sitting there waiting for our server who never really made it back to our table, we just paid the bill and left. The service ruined our experience."

Since we didn't have reservations and they were booked, we were seated at the bar. It was actually fun to see the workers in action. Several employees helped us, but Alain was the main server/bar tender. We weren't his best customers since we don't drink alcohol. We ordered two appetizers: arancino (fried risotto balls with provolone cheese, crushed red pepper chutney, fresh lemon zest and onions) and the best Caesar salad we've EVER had--there were huge slices of Parmesan cheese and several pieces of crispy bacon with lots of Romaine lettuce and dressing. It was amazing. They offered us complimentary soft, chewy bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We shared a delicious Capra pizza which had thin Neapolitan crust, grilled eggplant, goat cheese and fresh basil leaves. They have burrata as part of their mozzarella bar which I love, but wanted to try new things. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert. It's nice to have such a good experience eating out on vacation. Wish this restaurant was in Salt Lake City."

/user_details?userid=HS1xj2PfkdhkmQaW6hJXqQ,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",3 star rating,"There are obviously a lot of restaurants to choose from in this area. My partner and I hate disappointing meals to the point where it will really bum us out, so we tried to choose wisely in this very touristy part of Montreal. Since pizza is a favorite, we hoped to not go wrong by choosing Mangiafoco. I'd say it was a good choice. Neapolitan pizza is my favorite. The pizza was simple, tasty, and well done. We had a cocktail and a glass of rose wine and shared a basic Margherita pie. It was lovely. We left and went to another restaurant try something else. Honestly, I'd recommend Mangiafoco. It's simple and delicious with nice service."
/user_details?userid=1YaTxpkYjqVfSk79zVvXVg,Diya S.,"Vienna, Austria",1 star rating,"I had high hopes and could not have been more disappointed. They served us burrata (my favourite cheese) that had gone sour. Seriously, it was a $30 ball of sour milk, and made us all sick. Note, this dish is supposed to be their speciality. Truly horrific. It gets worse. I made clear I have allergies and asked for the gluten free pizza. They serve me a pizza with the regular crust. If I hadn't thought to double check before tasting, I would've been seriously ill. After this huge mess-up, the waitress barely apologized, and I was sitting there waiting for 20min while my party finished their meals. What's more, they burned the pizza they should've been rushing to bring out! Crust was inedible and tasted like charcoal - it was rock hard & squeaky. To top it all off, our waiter was extremely unprofessional....in 1 hour, we observed her taking at least 4 shots while working (Maybe that's why she forgot my order...). She also disappeared to the bar (directly below us) to socialize while we waited for our check. Seriously one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had, especially at that price."
/user_details?userid=w8MFny2c_sOngPLSlY9yzw,Rich S.,"Long Island City, NY",1 star rating,"This place was extremely OVERPRICED for what you are getting. I paid 50 CAD for a tiny ball of mozzarella and some prosciutto. Like REALLY?  I'm from NYC and I know what the value of a really good fresh ball of mozzarella should run and it SURELY was not this much. The prosciutto was NOT from Parma and was clearly slices of over dried and poorly cut meat, not sliced this like prosciutto should be. Why was it this much??? Who knows. The place was loud and had a very disrespectful encounter with some possibly drunk patrons. Overall, you can find a much better place for your money, I went across the street to the steak place, you should join me...."

Unfortunately the tomatoes based sauce is too acid to make great pizza, but was also didn't taste fresh ripped tomatoes. I've tasted a lot of napolitan pizza in my life, but I can't say it's the best. The wine list is great tho. Maybe I had too much expectations..."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The pizzas are good. We came here for my surprise birthday dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was very busy. The tasting menu looked interesting but the waitress said 10 people had to participate and not everyone was down to share a bunch of cheeses and pizzas for $40. My boyfriend and I shared the caprese salad with burrata. We also shared a fuoco pizza and the carbonara pizza. I preferred the latter. I chose the fuoco  because the fuoco pizza is supposed to be spicy but it wasn't that spicy. It's as if you put chili oil or chili flakes on it. I still added the chili oil to the pizza. It had tomato sauce, mozzarella, casalingo salami , red pepper and citrus zest sour cream. I think the pizza would have been better without the citrus zest. The carbonara had garlic confit cream sauce, a soft boiled egg, pancetta, grana padano cheese which is comparable to Parmesan cheese and green onion.My friends were raving about the prosciutto pizza so I want to come back and try it!"
/user_details?userid=tVHCMlHsPsytrCkbIrMfxA,Robert J.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,This was good but not over the top and a bit expensive on the apps.  Had the calamari which underperformed for sure.  The mozzarella was good with some side...peppers and salami.  The pizza was decent but not great. Worth going but probably only once.
/user_details?userid=gcax766FwtrzKUvK1untcw,Aurora M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This place was a great spot for a casual dinner but would also be a great spot for a date night as well. We ordered the burrata with tomato salad and prosciutto. It came with a warm bread basket and balsamic and olive oil. It was as delicious as it sounds. We then decided to split a margherita pizza  (with more mozzarella, can you tell we like cheese?) and the sauce was really good. The pizza size was decent to split but if you're looking for a large meal you may want to order more food."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I finally got to try this resto out with my group of foodie friends after reading all the great reviews. I must say I am still puzzled at what is so great about this resto. In terms of ambiance, yes the resto decor is trendy and modern looking so I would give them that much. However, service was ok at best as we we repeatedly reminded that we had our table until 9pm and our reservation was 6:30pm. Now for the food, one word Disappointing. The entrees were ok at best. We all ordered pizzas which are overpriced for the quality. Pizza lacked taste and did not taste like traditional neapolitan wood oven pizza. I ordered the pesto pizza which tasted awful. I must also mention dessert. I ordered the tiramisu thinking that at least would be ok. I was wrong again..instead of traditional lady finger cookies they used this hard as a rock cake like bottom. It ruined the whole dessert. Perhaps the chef had a off night and we were unlucky to have chosen that night but the food overall was nothing to write home about. The cocktails and drinks are also overpriced. However, this resto is located in the old port which caters to the tourist mass. Food quality is what impresses me most about restos and this one just failed to do so."
/user_details?userid=NGwmmkmIlKpEXL2bGnZSUA,Beth G.,"Forest Hills, NY",4 star rating,"Tired, hungry and ready to quit our search for food and just eat pretzels and cereal for dinner, Mangiafoco came to the rescue. We had a long day of walking which was further extended by our search for food. While there is an overwhelming array of restaurants in Montreal, it's hard to find something reasonably priced AND that will satisfy kids. Mangiafoco hit the spot. We were definitely fish out of water here. Two adults, two kids, walking into this trendy looking restaurant, but the staff was super accommodating and friendly. We ordered a straight up Margherita pizza and it was delish! We had hot oil on the side and yum! It was SO tasty. I kept drowning my pizza crust in it because it was so good! The staff was attentive and helpful. The only really negative part was the bathroom situation. It was just a weird location and deemed ""creepy"" by the kids-I wouldn't go that far, but it was certainly strange. You have to go out into the restaurant foyer type area, through an unmarked door, down into a basement. Had my husband not ventured to find the bathroom before us, I don't know that I would've found it!"

I am from Texas and was here for a work trip while it happened to be my birthday and they did not disappoint. The mozzarella bar and all the sides were to die for. The wine selection was beyond amazing.

Seriously, just turn off your cell or computer and eat here.Everything was excellent - the foie gras appetizer, the IPA, the wine, the service, the pizza. Oh man, the pizza. I still dream about it. My girlfriend and I were both very hungry, so we got two pizzas with the intention of taking the leftovers home. The Carbonara had more subtle flavors, and the egg on top was cooked just right, so the yolk was still runny - and oh man did it taste great with the rest of the pizza. My favorite was the Fuoco, which has a warning that it's spicy. ""Not spicy, but balanced,"" the waiter said. It was spicy with just the right amount of heat. I love spicy food so this was a home run for me.They also have a mozzarella bar, which looked interesting. Try it if you can, but whatever you do, don't miss out on the amazing pizza.Are you still reading this? Turn it off and eat here!"
/user_details?userid=ELtPyod4vrNICGvVjOd0Ow,Kerri C.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Ehhh it was okay. Pizza was good ( we had the Margherita de buffalo), but the calamari not so much. Unfortunately it left us underwhelmed due to lack of seasoning, heavy breading, and incompatible sauce which was more like a bruschetta sauce. Drinks were good, service was attentive. Overall final impression was for the price the food was mediocre."
/user_details?userid=L1jIYf62MKYlHDYeZhwEZQ,David D.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Pizza was OK.  Service was slow considering the restaurant was not that full and the order was fairly simple.

Sadly, although they accommodated us right away without a reservation, the food was so sub-par. We shared a salad and margherita bufala pizza.  So average.  The pizza particular had no taste and it looked better than it tasted. Wine was fine as was the selection.  We wished we had gone elsewhere for our hyped up Friday night dinner."
/user_details?userid=7Tv_3pMpw-ESrhO37A2gOA,Marjorie B.,"Glenview, IL",4 star rating,It was ok.  Now you have to realize we are from Chicago and quite picky about our pizza.  I ordered the Caesar salad which had a unique presentation and loved the salad.  I ate the pizza...We sat in the window and people watched !!
/user_details?userid=7GBhg_vJLpsyQr0Al3901A,Joe D.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a gem. Me and my girlfriend decided to stop here for dinner once we saw ""Mozzarella bar"" on the sign outside. The Truffle burrata is one of the better things we've tasted, worth the price of admission. Black truffle carpaccio, prosciutto and mortadella to compliment the burrata also was well worth it and really was delicious. We came to Montreal to explore and enjoy French influenced cuisine (which was great as well) but ended up really loving this place. Great staff and great atmosphere. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The pizza here is a cross between Neapolitan style and thin crust... and it works! I particularly enjoyed their pizza sauce which is absolutely delicious. We tried a few of them and they were all very good. The caesar salad was nicely plated but rather tasteless. Finally I like the industrial look, but the seats that are torn just make the place look worn out. Cocktails are also pretty good and original. Service is friendly"
/user_details?userid=J9mHpteG5XVio6NqcwHPCg,Jessica B.,"Kansas City, MO",5 star rating,"Where do I start? The place was booked up, even in a Monday, but we snagged two spots at the bar, easily. The entire staff was fun, attentive and knowledgeable. The veal meatballs are so tender they'll make you cry. The pizza crust regardless of pizza, is excellent. I love the mozz bar: pick your mozzarella and a few sides to Choose Your Own App Adventure :-) Save room for the white chocolate mousse!"

/user_details?userid=-Xgoxeg-wcCMST88G-i9Aw,D L.,"Agawam, MA",2 star rating,First put up a sign up with your name we can read in the dark. Jumbled up letters is not a sign.Pizza is over priced and my backyard brick oven makes way better. Service went out of their way to avoid our cramped table by the wall. It was amusing how often they would walk by and never look our way.$21 10 inch mushroom pizza really? $21 for 10 inch.. repeat after me NO!Maybe this place is trying too hard to be trendy vs good food for a good value.Go elsewhere nothing missed here.
/user_details?userid=GE6Ly9btqVv7lPj3twDTtA,Nick L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Simply delicious. I went there to celebrate the end of a session with one of my friend. Close to the metro station in the old port of Montreal, the place is welcoming to say the least.We started with and entree of calamari and polpette. The calamari while small in comparison to what I'm use to were fresh and crispy. The sauce that was going with it, a kind of arabiatta sauce was just spicy enought to tickle the palate.My friend had the prociutto pizza while I was delecting  myself with the lobster and bacon one. I'm use to wooden oven pizza but that one, great just great. The lobster was bacon were tender enought and the dough cook perfectly.The only downside to this place are the seats, we had to change place twice before finding a comfy enough seat to give a proper salute to that meal. Definitely a place I'll return"

/user_details?userid=6iJP3XlPU5yz5j0WDB9Dww,Peter G.,"Grove City, OH",3 star rating,"Visited Mangiafoco while attending the Canadian GP. We had an opportunity to try several things from the menu. Interesting layout with staggered levels and seating at different levels. We were at the top so we could look down the long to the front of the restaurant.Started with Calamari and Burrata caprese to which we added a side of salami. The burrata and tomatoes were very fresh and the salami was excellent thinly sliced and full of flavor. A nice touch was two small squeeze bottles of EVOO and Balsamic to put on the cheese, tomatoes and salami. Also a basket of fresh bread to go along with it.The calamari was nothing special, but the spicy tomato sauce was very good.Also ordered a Caesar salad which was an interesting twist by using a small head of romaine with a nice dressing, some pieces of bacon and shaved parmesan cheese. It was very good.Ordered two pizzas: a classic margherita and Pizza Catania - smoked chicken, roasted cherry tomatoes and peppers with some slices of avocado an basil. Both pizzas had excellent flavor and were well cooked, but I did not think the dough was up to the other ingredients. It was just too soft for me, clearly needed some harder durum flour or something.Interesting but pricey drinks on the menu. Service was ok.I would give Mangiafoco 4 stars except, it is really too pricey for the portions."

/user_details?userid=1jwqXiKhmb2pfWlhDJXT2w,Jeffrey B.,"Brea, CA",2 star rating,"I was looking forward to dining at Mangiafoco based on a recommendation my wife and I received from a Montreal local. ""It's my favorite Italian restaurant"", he raved. Well, I've got to say, it's far from mine! As I perused the menu offerings, I saw several items that I hoped would live up to the hype.The appetizer list included grilled octopus served with Grana Padano cheese for $19. I've enjoyed this dish at many fine restaurants from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico to Barcelona, Spain, as well as great tapas spots in California. As an appetizer it was pricy in comparison to the others on the menu but, if done properly, I was up for it. I asked our server, ""Is it for one tentacle, or more"". I was told, ""Usually it's two but it depends on the weight.""Not really understanding how that answered my question, I said ""Ok."" My wife ordered a Caesar salad for $13 and a recommended glass of red wine ($12.50) to start, and we agreed that if the dishes were good, we'd order more. The grilled octopus came and I saw 1 tentacle cut in 2 pieces. It was served on a smallish bed of not well prepared kidney and garbanzo beans in a tasteless sauce(?), except for a lot of salt and some pickled(?) red onions that tasted really ""off"" without the acidic hit of a good red vinegar, or anything one might recognize as helping to balance the flavors. Instead, the chef used some mustard that muddied the flavors of everything, including the octopus, except for the abundance of salt which was enhanced by the cheese which was floating on the beans and had been turned into  few broken up tuile pieces of cheese wafers. I guess the only balance the chef achieved was how profitable it was for the restaurant! Crappy, cheap, underdone, flavorless  beans, a few rings of crappy, poorly conceived pickled onions, broken up wafers of cheese, and one tentacle for $19. My wife's Caesar salad came deconstructed. The chef put a bed of uncut romaine leaves on the plate and the other ingredients stacked on top.It was impossible to get a combined taste of the ingredients without doing the work of breaking down the salad which the chef failed to do.At least the wine was good. Do I really need to say, we didn't order more before departing, poorer for the experience and anything but satisfied by what we ate."
/user_details?userid=AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The restaurant was a nice space, although the two of us were placed in a very narrow table, against the wall. The wine list was good. Ordered mozzarella di buffala with sides, the cheese was delicious, but the sides were just ok (truffle carpaccio- very good, grilled asparagus (no flavour), truffled peaches (just ok), marinated artichokes (tasted straight out of the jar), and the cantalop and cilantro salad (just melon cut up with cilantro thrown on top still on the stalk). We had to ask for bread for accompaniment, and were only given a few slices and never offered more. Shared a pizza Margherita with the mozzarella di buffala, was ok, the crust was tasteless- much better options elsewhere in Montreal. Overall, we spent 165$ for 1 bottle of wine (40$) and the above listed food... Very expensive and we left hungry and not having really enjoyed our meal. Moreover, the music was too loud, and club-like, despite the fact that on Sat night, most clients were couples on a date. Service was also lacking. Would not recommend and will not be going back. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."

Perfect !As our mains we shared two pizzas, one with a great mix of mushrooms and another one with mortadella, prosciutto and fresh mozzarella. They were delicious ! You can definitely tell how fresh the ingredients are. Loved it. I did not see the bill but I do believe the prices are a bit high. But definitely worth it.

/user_details?userid=xO-NeCtKGkxQOSQUNKAT1A,Natasha B.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Though service was excellent, the food was a travesty. Beyond the fact my mom found a huge long hair in her food, the pizza was dry and salty, and tasted of little else besides burnt bread. The poached egg on my Campagna had the consistency of muccus, and the prosciutto was like eating jerky. The artichokes on my moms pizza were basically made of vinegar, and the arugala placed, apparently, to hide the horror beneath. Though they comped my barely eaten pizza, my mother's (who towards the end, found a hair) was not taken off the bill. Despite kind service, this is not sufficient to warrant my ever returning."

/user_details?userid=OxvPHnkFytJ4J-JtjKrkCw,Anna N.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"In the heart of old Montreal, steps from Notre Dame. Gorgeous decor. Downhill from there. Only one pasta on the menu, cannelloni which is very pricey and is an appetizer portion and really not good. The format is to build an appetizer, every item is pricey, portions are small and the pickled vegetables are not even of the finer imported variety, they are of the common commercially packaged types. Presentation was nice, but that's it! Something we can do at home. The only thing that was really delicious and well prepared was the octopus, but the portion was shamefully small and at the exorbitant price, we didn't bother ordering another. They specialize in Pizza, so it would have to be amazing, or at least good.....you would think. Sauce was not tasty or luscious, it was bland and undercooked. Size of the pizza was small and still there were a few pieces left over because it wasn't worth the bother. Our server was rude and made an issue when I didn't leave a tip. Asked if there was anything she could do to ""adjust"" the service. A little too late as I'm about to walk out the door. I'm guessing that the location attracts patrons, cannot imagine this business sustaining itself on repeat business or word of mouth. Definitely not a good experience!"
