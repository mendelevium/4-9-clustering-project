Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed.  I had the spicy Italian sausage poutine and it was DELICIOUS! The atmosphere is a.o.k. The servers were nice and friendly, but the only time I got to see my server is when I was served and when it was time to pay the bill *tsk tsk tsk* I tried their lemonade drink and it was very refreshing! I would have taken seconds...Would I come back? Sure! It's close to the Old Port Montreal, great scenery around the area. Love it :-D"
/user_details?userid=_9WN_qmjbbRu6eFCMVXokw,Tia B.,"North York, Canada",3 star rating,"Ok would be just how I would explain this experience. We saw a lady standing outside the door during our walk and we thought, we could try a poutine. So we followed her upstairs and into this old crickety dine spot where everyone around was enjoying multiple different poutines. We ordered one to share, the spicy italian sausage poutine is what we decided on.It was alright. The sausage definitely had some smokey taste to it and my husband who loves poutine seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. I'm not the biggest poutine fan (I know don't kill the messenger!) so I just ate around the cheese curds to be honest. It was alright and my husband said it was an alright poutine but nothing special."
/user_details?userid=mVdNDX7tdVNZmHowQJ-ZBg,Neha G.,"Fairfax, VA",4 star rating,"I was visiting Canada and heard poutine is a staple canadain dish and an absolute try so we stopped here.They have nice outdoor seating if the weather is nice. They have limited vegetarian options, infact they just have onions poutine in vegetarian. We ordered that and a garden salad. Taste was okay. It tasted like fries with gravy you get on a game night in the US. Overall it was okay. Service was little off. They brought 3 machine to swipe my credit card but none of them were working."

/user_details?userid=6EQDa-MeN3jN6GJ2ftGeCA,Olivia R.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Definitely a tourist hot spot. I was craving poutine and nearby so I decided to stop in for a quick bite...unfortunately the service was not so quick. The smoke meat poutine was however surprisingly delicious! I would come back to try the fried chicken poutine.Huge con: they only sell plastic bottles of water (also how wasteful!)
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",3 star rating,"Yelp calls 3-stars ""A-OK"" and that's exactly what my experience was at Montreal Poutine. It was good...but not amazing. We picked up our poutine to go, and the wait was LONG!!! In terms of the food, we tried the smoked meat poutine and the regular poutine. The smoked meat poutine was delicious, however La Belle Pro's version is so much better... The regular poutine was, again, ""A-OK"". Nothing special about this place, but its a nice spot if you are craving poutine, and want a fulfilling meal to-go. Just don't expect quick service or anything special about what you order."
/user_details?userid=CAgLPOjaWka_DSU2U6k8SA,Shuang W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We were starved when we walked in that poutine store, and the girl sat us down. Right after we sat down we already knew whatever to order, and we were tryin so hard to get their attention so we could order. That same girl was flirting with the other male servers literally for the entire time we were there and she did not have time for us. Srsly we were starved and thirsty, and 3 of your servers were flirting all the time and there was one who actually went around and took orders from so many tables, how does this make sense?  Poutine was amazing!!! The gravy is so hearty, the fries is so crispy and the cheese curd is literally melting on the top, we finished the entire plate in 10 minutes! We asked them for water and they only had bottle water, it's 2018 now and there are just still restaurants who don't care about protecting the earth, this is little bit disappointing. I heard this place opens up at the terrace during the summer, honestly I would only come back as long as I don't have to deal with slow and bad services anymore."

The dining area is literally surround by 4 buildings with an open air concept. Love it. Great and relaxing atmosphere and staff are super friendly and pricing is good and portions I got from my poutine with fried chicken was excellent. Overall be coming back soon and if you want to try eat great fresh poutine in Old Montreal this is it!!

Poutine was okay - not sure I would take someone here for their first experience. They have a nice outside area with interesting decorations (random ET lurking in the corner) but it's HOT so sit outside only on a cool day

Maybe because we were tourist but this place totally screamed poutine. This was our first time trying this dish and it was totally awesome. Very simple yet full of flavor, and the red sangria was so refreshing and fruity!"
/user_details?userid=ucXSsnIsb0rMyICZiu1-IQ,Nayara L.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"My friends and I had an awesome time here! There were 4 of us and between the 4 of us we got the spicy Italian sausage poutine, regular poutine, fried chicken poutine, and smoked meat poutine, plus a pitcher of red sangria. All were DELICIOUS and the service was amazing. The sangria tasted watered down but it still tasted good. Everything was affordable and we loved the ambiance. It was small and not too loud but still comfortable and friendly. Our server Maxime was extremely kind and very charismatic and attentive. We loved our experience here!"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The best thing I can say about the smoked meat poutine was the portion size was large. The fries were pedestrian, the gravy was coagulated and frankly reminded me of something out of a jar. I sat upstairs and even though there was only one other table the service was terrible. Disappointing...I won't go back and certainly can't recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=gVDmPozA7R9XD4ku4wLHgQ,Jaclyn G.,"Randolph, NJ",2 star rating,Disappointing. We wanted to try poutine for the first time. Our local fries are better. I don't know if this is what they taste like all over but given the restaurants name you would think they would be good here. 80s music in the background and the bad fries made me feel like I was 12 at a roller rink back home. Oh well. We tried.
/user_details?userid=KnOSDa_qimK8r77FBMHprg,Nick R.,"Bethesda, MD",3 star rating,Sigh - I mean it's not awful but it's definitely designed to be somewhat of a tourist trap. At least it satisfied the craving for some classic poutine. Give it a shot - but with a little more research I'm sure you could find some more authentic locales.
/user_details?userid=R1FxH5rBELVAcowusz564w,L E.,"Chino Hills, CA",3 star rating,"As my first time in Montréal, Canada, in the cold winter December, Yelp prompted us to check-out this place in the touristy area of Montreal. Based solely on what we ate, we were satisfied. For a party of 3, we shared the Smoked Meat Poutine with fried onions, cheeseburger, dark beer & Coke. Having added the fried onions to the poutine (as suggested by our server), made the dish more palatable and to our liking. The restaurant was more than half-filled with tourists during the Christmas season. Food - 3 starsAmbiance - 2.5 (I don't understand why they're playing reggae music. Some feel-good Christmas music would've been more appropriate to tie in with the season)Price- 2.5 (a bit expensive)"

/user_details?userid=oAInL2Ci-_BUa7SGIMWA_g,Karlee B.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,Service was good and food was decent but nothing to ecstatically write home about. We were running out of time and needed to try some poutine so this is where we ended up. The atmosphere was cool and the beer selection was good so happy with that. I think the poutine was ok. Nothing to compare it to but we both ate most of our plates.
/user_details?userid=pppIHoA8b8B8Wd5t72sDxA,Veronica K.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I'm surprised by the lack of love for this place. Yeah, it's in a touristy area, but despite that I feel like this is overall a really nice little restaurant. I did not suffer the bad service other reviewers have complained of, so perhaps that is influencing my opinion.If you sit near the window you'll get a nice view of the street below, great for people watching and relaxing. The poutine itself is delicious and on point; the gravy is ample, the curds are squeaky, and in my case the smoked meat was cooked just right. They also have a good selection of beer on tap, most from local craft breweries in Quebec, so you're sure to find something interesting to imbibe. Since it's a bit touristy the food here is perhaps a bit expensive for what it is, but who am I to judge, since the exchange rate was in my favor anyway. My meal here was tasty and I would come back again one day. I would say it's worth a shot."
/user_details?userid=ub7Ante8rFffJoxeE33Y3g,Nancy N.,"Atlanta, GA",3 star rating,"This rugged sports bar type restaurant is located upstairs next to a souvenir shop. They offer many types of poutine and recommend the beer! The fries came out a bit too soggy for my liking, the staff was friendly, and offers a nice view of the street."
/user_details?userid=Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww,Lily F.,"Falls Church, VA",3 star rating,"Like many folks, we decided to stop in for a chance to warm up and eating some hearty poutine and grab a cocktail.  We ended up splitting an order of the smoked meat poutine and a couple of hotdogs.  We also made the horrible mistake of ordering a Long Island ice tea.  What?! Don't judge me.  They said they couldn't make an Old Fashioned because they were out of one of the ingredients.  Poutine was average.  The gravy and cheese were okay but the smoked meat was strange.  It was just all mushy and slapped on and kind of tasted like bologna.  The Long Island was a joke.  It's was just all soda/pop/Coke.  I've never seen a long island drink that was pretty much all black.  Bleh. Surprisingly enough though, the hot dogs were pretty good.  Very simple and ball park-like. Skip the smoked meat poutine and try another variety."
/user_details?userid=2Oc2tjHaCa-dW4_dtuY9ew,Ronak P.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,I would definitely say that this place was worth it beyond words. We could not stop with just one order each of any of their Poutines. Great ambience as well with their outdoor seating in the back

/user_details?userid=Kj5SVYHReqLin7H1pso12A,Helen S.,"Cuddebackville, NY",3 star rating,"Poutine is a must-have when in Montreal! We opted for the poutine with spicy Italian sausage & the poutine with fried onions. I would have liked for the Italian sausage to be spicier, but other than that the poutine overall was quite delicious. My only complaint would be the ambiance of the place, we went at night so it was quite dark outside already, and there were only some very dim lights hanging around inside the restaurant, we could barely see what the poutine looked like. But maybe it's suppose to give off the rugged sort of feel, as we were in the old town area."
/user_details?userid=tb7fFAkmV3AyfONQYUgHaQ,Michelle S.,"New Westminster, Canada",2 star rating,"This was my first time visiting Montreal so I wanted 2 things for dinner: Montreal Smoked Meat and Poutine! Because of my hotel's location I decided to try this place out for poutine, and hoped that they might have some smoked meat too. No luck on the meat, but there was a lot of poutine on the menu (as the restaurant name suggests). However, dinner was ultimately a disappointment. I've had poutine many times before, and this one was just not very good. First of all, the gravy was watery and didn't have much depth to it. I ordered the poutine with fried chicken on it, and the chicken tasted freezer burnt to me - really dry and stringy. The curds and fries were decent, but poutine really shouldn't be difficult to make so this was really disappointing. It was really expensive for what it was too -- $10 for a beer (is this a normal price in Montreal? Seems expensive) and $13.50 for the poutine...I could have gone to KFC for a poutine at half price that would taste miles better.Finally, I guess because of the time of year there wasn't much going on in Old Montreal. There was only 1 other table when I arrived, and they left before me so it was a bit awkward to be the only person eating in the restaurant. Not really the restaurant's fault so I take no stars away for that, but still worth it to note. I probably wouldn't have gone in at all if I could have seen what the situation was like from outside, but as it is, the restaurant is located upstairs so by the time I saw that it was a ghost town it was too awkward to leave."
/user_details?userid=jf7xWXGx16U_RJ_ppv3yww,Jeff S.,"Charleston, SC",5 star rating,"My wife and I made this our first stop in Montreal and the poutine did not disappoint. The open air seating is quaint and has a distinct European feel to it. We both ordered regular poutine and I can say it's the best I've ever had. The gravy makes the poutine, and Montreal Poutine has done it right. Plus the cheese curds were fresh and plentiful. They also have a great drink menu and craft beer selection. If you're looking for an authentic Montreal poutine experience right in the heart of Old Montreal then this is the place."

The poutine portions were nice and big and the service was very good. Only the sandwitch portion was not as big as we expected relative to the poutine. Overall, I definitely recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=VgCeQIPIYRihyOESQew1ig,Ian H.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",1 star rating,"The server was very nice and friendly.The outside terrace was inviting on a gorgeous Montreal day.The food was 'ok' - nothing wrong with it, but not something to write home about either.There is no Children's menu, nor ideas for children aside from ""well, you could take it to go"". The restaurant does NOT offer water. This is the only time in my life at any restaurant that I have been told ""if you want water, we have bottled water available"". To me, this felt like an easy way for the establishment to collect an extra $5 per head - and turn off a client.The food was over priced - which is to be expected in a heavily trafficked tourist zone like the Old Port of Montreal - but charging for water is a scam.It should not be costing over $20 per person to eat at a casse croute."
/user_details?userid=I0I83n6ehIIsiUJScvjBqw,Howard K.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"The poutine here is pretty amazing.  The gravy here has a lot of depth and packs a lot of flavour.  The cheese is what you would expect on a poutine - squishy and squeaky.  I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat poutine and I can say that they gave us equal amounts of smoked meat along with the fries.  The potatoes were done nice and crispy.  For takeout, it can be a bit pricier.  It was $15 for a small-mid size styrofoam container.  However, probably one of the best poutines I've had."

The server came back with Naya water and we realized they charge $3.5 each!! The menu has Eska water for $3.5 but they gave us Naya which is way cheaper!!!It's definitely a scam.

In my non expert opinion everything was great. The poutine had two different gravies on it and both were really tasty. The fries were cooked to perfection and there was a lot of cheese. We sat upstairs and the waiter was way overworked and did not get to us as often as I would have liked, specially to refill my beer.Price was pretty high but considering the location and clientelle its in the right range"

Super quiet, there was literally no one in the restaurant, it felt like a ghost town.  FOOD: I was beyond disappointed. Not only was the portion tiny, the ""fried chicken"" was basically just rotisserie chicken. Plus, it was dry and didn't taste fresh at all. I would NOT recommend this place and I will never come back here again.PRICE: Overpriced for the portion and quality you're getting. So not worth the money and time. You can eat better and pay less at La Banquise.SERVICE: The service was horrible too. Waiters are not attentive at all, not welcoming and just seem like they don't care. The staff just stayed on their phones and when we asked for water, they gave us water bottles which were another hidden 2$."

Everything came out very quickly (though we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time... I assume it's much busier in the summer months) and was piping hot upon delivery!I loved the flavors of both dishes and they were different enough that trying multiple was definitely a good decision!Service was fine enough, the women working seemed a little off in their own world, but were attentive whenever we did need anything.

The ambiance was mellow; not very busy midweek; and the ""entertainment"" was an old boom box on a shelf in the corner. Poutin is not for me, but I have nothing to compare it to and now I can say I've had fries with gravy and cheese curds at a place that's famous for it."

As soon as we walked upstairs, for a moment we thought this place was closed too, it was completely empty and most of the lights were dimmed. A guy who was busy conversing with another guy told us we could sit where we wanted so we picked a table near the window. The service was really lacking the basics , we felt like they did not want to make any effort. The same guy took our orders but did not try to make any conversation and looked bored. We had the classic poutine and the smoked meat poutine, which were good. During the entire time we were there, the person who served us remained near the kitchen and continued his conversation with his coworker, pretty much ignoring us even though we were the only customers inside.We had to pay cash because of some issues with their system.

It came with a side of fries which you can imagine we needed to take to go since we were filled with poutine. The service was good. There were only 3 other tables so the server was pretty attentive. The price was decent for the portions that we received. Location is great - right in the heart of the Old Port. Overall a really great experience and would definitely recommend for a quick bite or a nice sit down meal."

We advised a server this is ridiculous very calmly and said we were ready to go. He advised since we offered to pay for the order previously and they said our order was on the house, they cancelled the food, and expected only to have our water, 1x sprite and 1x long island iced tea on the house bill.

Birds above my food is a pretty stressful eating arrangement. But if you can get one of the coveted seats above the street you'll have a great view.

He made it seem like we were a bother by asking him to clean it. When we said we didn't want to purchase an alcoholic drink, we were not even offered water. He didn't even come back after the meal was served to ask how things were. There was little to none interaction from the service end. We felt like we were a bother to them. He was more concerned about his man bun. I would say overall the service was lacking, like they didn't care. I would not come back for that reason. As for the food. It's nothing special. The poutine was average, nothing special for poutine. The portion was big though. The smoked meat sandwich was tiny, the meat tasted processed, not like a clean piece of meat. It was quite pricey for a small portion. If the service was minimal, we might come back, but it was little to none."

The actual poutine was ok though. The smoked meat sandwich was very good if not small. The atmosphere was dark, but was really got me was that the place was understaffed. This made the wait long.

Awesome looking! Perfect pairing to a classic Canadian dish....full disclosure they make pouting everywhere now in Canada and USA. But most use gravy from a box and mozzarella cheese...I make this weekly at home for the kids! The Poutine here is miles ahead of anything I've tried before. Fresh cut fries nothing special...the gravy though..I believe they use duck fat to make it taste so rich I could have drank that by the glass! Then the squeaky cheese or other wise know as cheese curds. The cheese stays intact instead of melting like mozzarella and makes a squishy noise when you eat it! Awesome. It is a meal in its self ....$9.00 best money spent in Montreal. A must visit!

It also feels like a tourist trap on the busy, touristy Rue St Paul. The poutine was okay, but the customer service really left a terrible last impression. First, it took 45 minutes for the poutine to arrive, and the restaurant was only moderately busy. On a hot day, where the tables were in the sun, the servers did not take the time to check on our table or ask if our water (or beverages) were refilled. There was very little attention paid during our entire visit. Once the food arrived, the server checked on us once. Again, the servers did not ask if we wanted any beverage refills or needed anything. Second, when the bill arrived, the server directly pointed out the recommended service fees. Given the extremely lackluster dining experience, and the correlation between good service and tips, we had paid (and tipped), but the server did not want to let us leave until we tipped her the amount she had anticipated. Given this undesirable last impression, just to leave the restaurant without further hassling from the server, I tipped her the amount she wanted. I wouldn't recommend that others visit the restaurant until the customer service improves. In contrast, La Banquise, despite its hectic, busy atmosphere provided both great poutine, along with stellar customer service."

Montreal poutine earns it's 4 stars by surpassing our (lowered) expectations. We were looking for a place to relax, where we can unwind with a snack and talk over a couple of pints, a place to bide our time in Old Montreal while we wait for our reservations at a fancy restaurant. Pickings were slim since we didn't want a full meal and other places just didn't have a very exciting selection of beers. We took a leap of faith and decided to venture into this terrasse hidden among souvenir shops.Service was OK. Not exceptional not awful but OK. We wanted beer and we wanted a snack and they brought these things to us and we were happy. They have a more diverse selection of beers on tap (about 8 to be precise) than other places we passed along. We had the Fin du Monde (9%) and a Blanche de Chambly  (5%) in 20oz pints for a mere $8.04 each. We wanted a cheaper lighter meal so we shared lovely crisp French fries with sauce (like the one they drench poutines in) for $5. And of course there's a moderate selection of  poutines($11-$12). I'm sure their poutines are adequate (their fries are very good) but I would make a point to also try poutine from more storied establishments like La Banquise. The terrasse is gorgeous. We had a memorable experience sipping our drinks in the open air enveloped on all sides by old stone walls with a giant E.T. looking down on us over the entrance. It felt great to take our time after a day rushing from one point of interest to another, and to spend it in this beautiful courtyard. The ambiance willThe bathroom is on the second floor inside the building. On your way to it look out the windows overlooking the terrasse and enjoy the view of your companion(s) stealing your fries.

My friends and I were visiting Canada and wanted to experience it the right way; considering this place pretty much exclusively sells poutine we figured it would be the best spot to try it out.Regrettably, it wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the sauce nor the cheese. I was assured by three different people on the staff that the sauce (normally gravy in the US) was vegetarian, but I still had my suspicions. I would've been better off just getting a basket of plain fries.The worst part was the service was super slow and disorganized. The interior was pretty expansive and reminded me of an old wooden pub. I love French fries with a passion but I guess poutine just isn't my thing. Sorry, Canada!"

I had the classic Poutine while my wife had the fried onion Poutine. Both arrived piping hot and both were very tasty. The best part, for me, was the fact that the gravy was light and flavourful And though the fries and curds were well covered, they weren't swimming in the gravy. This allowed a good portion of the fries to maintain their crispy texture.  Fresh potatoes, flavourful gravy,  soft curds and crispy fries made for many perfect bites. And to top things off, they had a GREAT 80's playlist going on in the background in a fantastic laid back patio area. A must visit if you find yourself in Old Montreal with a Poutine craving!"

The portion kinda small though. I would give it a 6/10. As for the smoked meat poutine, it was deadly! The gravy not too heavy and just tangy enough. The cheese was melting and getting messy in the best way. The fries cooked perfectly and the smoked meat gave a nice flavor to the dish. Overall it was deliciously addictive. Forget about the zillion calories and just dig in! 9/10Because it's called poutine house I give them 4 stars but the sandwich didn't deserve that."

Being vegetarian, my mom was on the hunt and wanted to try poutine. Unfortunately, this wasn't the experience we had. The dish itself was basically French fries in a soy sauce with pieces of mozzarella cheese- not sure if this is what it should be like but not our favorite. Slightly more unfortunate was that we waited more than 30 minutes for one order of fries. Not sure if this was just our experience or if we just had different expectations but not our favorite.EDIT: after trying poutine at another place, we have come to the realization that the dish at this place was fine- just not for us. Almost the same as another place. Have changed from 2 star to 3."

Only drawback was they only had beer and sangria, no cider. Not an issue, just try one of the Canadian or local brews. And if you're lucky, you just might share desert with one of the owners.

Unfortunately, I wish we had kept walking but we didn't and went in. Right from the get go, the two girls who were the hostesses, were unprofessional and appeared to not know what they're doing.After we had ordered, they brought our drinks and one of the glasses began to leak all over the table. The young woman who was cleaning tables actually walked by my table and looked at it and walked away. Other guests sitting beside us were offering their napkins to help clean up or stop the spill.Only when we complained, did they come and clean up the mess.My wife ordered a spicy sausage poutine and it was horrible. The gravy tasted like it was store-bought; the gravy and the fries were nothing to write home about. I had the grilled chicken burger and I can make better ones at home on my own grill and for the price, it was found wanting.The same girl who wouldn't clean the table also came and grabbed my plate as I was finishing the last bite and didn't even ask if I was finished, just pulled it away. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for our waiter to come back to give us the bill even when our plates were gone. He wasn't happy when I was looking for a number amount for the tip instead of a percentage. There is no way that I would ever go back there and it was very poor that they call themselves Montreal poutine. Nothing of the sort. #Notworthspendingyourmoneythere."

Lured in by promises of poutine and moderately priced beer. We sat down upstairs, no music, very cramped, crappy tables, and uncomfortable chairs. It took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come and talk to us and take our orders. When we finally got our food after about 35 minutes it was overcooked and bland.

For the food, this place would be 4 stars but what I did not appreciate, was the server. At first she gave me a water with ice, even though I had asked for it without. I decided it was not a big deal. Then, my boyfriend asked for some more water and she did not show up with it for another 10mins. Later, we were sitting and chatting when she abruptly gave us the bill without asking if we were ready for it. We thought maybe there were people waiting to be seated but we looked around to see that the place had a lot of space. It felt awkward but we were done anyway so we did not say anything. All of that aside, I would not have written a negative review but here is where I had the biggest issue - my boyfriend had paid but he didn't notice that the tips were not included in the bill. On seeing this, the waitress pointed out that the tip was not included. He (having not known this) apologised and checked this wallet to see that he did not have a denomination small enough and mentioned this to her. She replied by saying he should run his card again and because of the displeasure clearly showing on both her tone and face, I said I would tip double what I was going to (so 30%). This is not how waitstaff should behave. It is not pleasant to mention it but even then, just once would have been enough for us to figure out the tips issue."

We each got a beer sleekman silver and sleekman rousse. The poutine was large in portion size so sharing was a good idea. The smoked meat was similar to pastrami in flavor but roast beef in texture. We asked for more gravy because only the top part of the poutine had gravy. The first server said ok to the gravy but never brought it to us. The second server said it was a dollar more, we agreed, and she brought it out right away. We sat outside and was entertained by the birds and a fellow customer's baby."

/user_details?userid=ia_VP5eC3DdqC5OXfzyr_g,Kirvan F.,"Grand Rapids Charter Township, MI",2 star rating,Not impressed.  Very limited dinner menu and limited drink menu.  Service was very poor.  Rarely saw our waitress.  Poutine was over priced fries were average toppings pretty bland.   I would go somewhere else.

If you want some crazy mixture of poutine youll be out of luck. But hey, their servings are pretty good and their poutines have just enough grease to make you full but not regret it."

/user_details?userid=cQJo-HvPD1Mg0IMHkC7dzA,Megan W.,"Columbus, OH",4 star rating,Stopped in with husband and kids for lunch while visiting Old Montreal as we had heard we needed to try good poutine. The little court yard was shady and quaint. We had a regular poutine and the spicy sausage. The sausage one was the same as the regular with just one sliced up sausage on top for about 3.50 more. The sausage was tasty though and we cut it up into small pieces and mixed it back in.
/user_details?userid=_35vfk8EiSZmtFUvC-tQeg,Bopanna K.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,I visited this place for some smoked meat and poutine. I do not have complaints on the quality of food. However the portion is considerably small for the price. The smoked meat platter consists of a tiny sandwich some salad one piece of pickle and a small portion of fries for over 20$. This is really not a platter and I would advise people to avoid it. I was disappointed by the platter as it is not enough to fill one person let alone be shared.

As for Montreal Poutine establishment, decent tavern, good beer, good place to hang out for a drink and sample the poutine but not exactly a find dining establishment, not that it was meant or trying to be that."
/user_details?userid=GhMO37oqto3StMtS0DV_gw,Jackie E.,"Hyattsville, MD",3 star rating,"The poutine was underwhelming and too salty. The restaurant is located in a great spot (near Jack Cartier square) and it has a nice ambiance inside, but the servers were not super friendly. Overall it was just okay."

/user_details?userid=cIBR-KZarqRp4LotYuke1A,P S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,SO good.  We had the basic poutine which was just delicious.  Savored every bite and had to really debate whether to get another order and forget about our dinner reservation.  Highly recommend if you want some delicious poutine in Montreal!

We went here for girls' night......WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE! DO NOT EAT POUTINE HERE. NOT IMPRESSED. 2/10..........you are better off at McDonald's. Worst poutine I've ever had. :("
/user_details?userid=cR8FGP3hXZsfeyD3U6z0AA,Guillaume L.,"Lyon, France",1 star rating,Worst poutine I have ever eaten. They don't use the appropriate cheese to make their poutines. Tourist trap!
/user_details?userid=RXC5y2iyNxoq63C2K26trQ,Julies F.,"Addison, TX",1 star rating,"This is the absolute worst place to go. Like others have said, if I could give zero stars I would. Our waiter was the most inattentive I have ever had. We waited about 23 minutes after we sat down before he even came to ask for our drinks. By then we were ready to order so we ordered our food with our drinks. We waited another hour before we got our food. Mind you, the only time we've seen our waiter was when he got our order and there were lots of empty tables. Our drinks never came. Luckily there were two waitresses that were able to help us so we were able to cancel our drinks and get our check. Instead of our original waiter coming out to bring our check, he cowardly sent it with one of the waitresses. Never got our drinks and never got an apology. We saw other tables that had him as a waiter complain about him as well. The food wasn't even that great and a little over priced. So disappointed. Definitely go to Poutineville instead... They're awesome!"
