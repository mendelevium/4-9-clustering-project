The owner of Schlouppe Bistro Nakamichi revamped the space into a Japanese influenced coffee shop. Being a fan of their ramen, when I read online that they were revamping it into a coffee shop, it was surely on my list! I finally took the time to go to the coffee shop during the holidays, which was empty but understandably, it being the holidays and in an area mostly filled with students..which I assume is the main clientele during peak hours. They only serve coffee using the V60 hand drip coffee method, which is fine by me! I do wonder what the wait time is when the coffee shop is filled though. We ordered two coffees and two onigiris. The coffee beans are from a local roaster, and teas from Camelia Sinensis.There were four different kinds of onigiris, and a few pastries. I have to say I was disappointed the pastries were not Japanese influenced, and that the onigiris were underwhelming and honestly on the pricey side for onigiris. I will surely come back to try the more substantial meal options when they are available and for the coffee, which was great."
