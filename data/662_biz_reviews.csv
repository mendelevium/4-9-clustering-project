The sweeping waterfront view really made this rooftop terrasse special. If I ever get the chance to go back I will try one of their sangrias.Walking by at night, the sign outside is easily missed if you're not paying attention."
/user_details?userid=JBYJFeQaxxy8iDQzEyFMrQ,Francisco V.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Was in Old Montreal back in July and my traveling partner kept her eye out for a few places. Shopping along the area, she said she had a great feeling about the place, and we went all the way to the rooftop terrace. She was not wrong.The vibe was perfect. A view to die for.As we arrived, we were told that there was a possibility of the bar being closed because of the rain. Apparently, it gets very windy, to the point where the structure gets impacted. We said it was fine, and we decided to take a corner seat that had just made itself available. This was easily the best view we had seen of Old Montreal, and it made the afternoon and evening that much more enjoyable. Where else can you take a seat and let the view dictate the rest of your plans for the night? This is the spot. You can see the entire St. Lawrence river, along with some of the attractions.I don't remember the name of my drink. Might have been a Paloma, but I'm not entirely sure. All I can tell you is that it was perfect. My traveling buddy had an Aperol spritz that was masterful. We didn't want to have anything too heavy, so we ordered the local organic charcuterie platter, the Pique Assiette, to share it among each other. Every one of the components was perfect. The Pâté de Campagne  was amazing - I had never had it before, and the pieces of blueberry along with the generous pork flavor was magnificent. I am also not a lover of bleu cheese, but this was a turning point for me, as I struggled to not hoard every single bite of it from my companion. The brie was spectacular. My only gripe was that there were not enough crostini or pieces of bread for me to use on every single bite.The wind started to pick up just as we were about to leave, but the pace of the rest of the night had been determined, all thanks to this spectacular venue with a view. If I'm ever back in Old Montreal, this is the first place I'm coming back to."

They are lovely. This is a bar not a restaurant. The food are bar food. There are a lot to choose from. The prices of cocktails are around 13$-15$.  Great view and quick service."
/user_details?userid=ma6206bmu-a_Ja7Iv-yRCw,Sharon M.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"This terrace was like the secret end location of a quest. We saw it twinkling away on a faraway rooftop while roaming Ville-Marie at nighttime. And because it was on a rooftop, the closer you got to it, the less you saw of it! Sneaky!If you happen to navigate to the right building, see the nondescript sign outside advertising the Terrasse, make your way through the confusing structure (counter-intuitively down some stairs, through an old timey bar thing, then up an elevator and up a few more stairs), you might finally be able to treat yourself to some extraordinary views of the city. This is one hell of a rooftop patio. 360 degree views including the brilliantly lit up ferris wheel and bridge. The staff were lovely. We were served by a very friendly and chatty gentleman that catered to us even though we ordered our first round of Sangria 5 minutes before last call and our second round after the supposed last call. The Sangria were lovely group sippers, perfect for those sweltering summer nights, but not for if you want to get drunk. We got the Melon Sangria made with Midori and a pinkish bubbly tropical one which I think was the Rose Sangria. Both delicious but I think I liked Melon one more. Very refreshing! At ~$50 a pitcher, it wasn't cheap but it wasn't outrageous either. Lots of fresh boozy fruit for you to snack on at the bottom. So glad to have stumbled upon this place. Hard to find, but once you do, it's a truly perfect place to soak up the views and the drinks. (62/100) - 2018"
/user_details?userid=jKn_HycMvKa3yPHAUoCQAQ,Angela C.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,"Fantastic view of old port- ferris wheel, the bridge and the canal! Drinks were on the pricey side, but the food was reasonably priced for the view. Unfortunately, we dropped by during the heat wave and they weren't serving salads or anything raw.... which was odd considering it was so hot -- alll that was left for food were charcuterie boards and roast beef sandwiches.We ordered a Chablis, a beer and a mixed plate charcuterie. The feature of the day was a rabbit tartar, salami and prosciutto. The cheese was a blue, a mild and an aged one. They also have croutons, grapes and spicy mustard. Overall great platter at a great portion but slightly pricier. I would come back for the view and the sunset."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wasn't aware of this seasonal terrace until this week and I'm glad to have discovered it. It's on the 5th floor rooftop of a hotel, L'Auberge. The angle of view ressembles the William Grey. The space & arrangement is a little more tight though.The staff is curteous & quick. The wine list is ok, nothing special, though borderline ""meh!"" the cocktail list seems to make up a little bit for it. The food menu is also very casual, simple sandwiches and salads. We took the same salad and it was pretty good :)I would definitely come back here for a little afterwork hang out."
/user_details?userid=ar-o21pk2bC3OsJCQAuhRg,Mel A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4 star rating,Came in for a drink with a view. Did not disappoint. The food menu is simple and limited. Although Yelp says it's a tapas bar the food is mostly salads and paninis. Definitely on the lighter side. The food we ordered was tasty and fresh. Wine list was also a little limited but we easily found a bottle to drink at sunset. Service was friendly and prompt. I'd definitely return for another evening.
/user_details?userid=8mUKPnpE66gB3yQYeYOZRA,Summer D.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"Best view in town hands down. It trumps anything else. I didn't come here to eat. So if the reviews seem below par, it is because people aren't taking the view into consideration. The drinks were awesome and the service was spot on. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. This spot is a hidden gem we stumbled upon when we saw the lights from the alley below."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another great rooftop patio! We had just gotten out of a bar and were walking around to try a different bar with a nice patio, when we saw this rooftop with lights so decided to check it out. We were pleasantly surprised when we got up there. A little bummed because we couldn't get a table on the side facing the river. The river view is very nice! But the other side view is not that bad. Plus the weather was just amazing that night so nevertheless we enjoyed our time there. If you like fruity Sangria, I recommend trying their melon sangria. Quite refreshing!"
/user_details?userid=TbpsLQpZsEy_x-uLfRVMfg,Nick B.,"Lincoln, NE",3 star rating,If you have to get to a terrace and you want to be able to see a 180 view of the city for 30 seconds while standing next to the people with the good view sitting at their table...go for it. But that's all it is unless you get one of the few tables with a good view. Service was quick and friendly but it was expensive and the soda I ordered was mostly ice. Overall not worth it.
/user_details?userid=TGgqgEFwSCHtTy887JG0Vg,Maureen L.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Me and a group of friends seen this place from far and thought it would be so nice to be up there. We searched for this place, which was a challenge. We ended up in a hotel and there was an arrow pointing upwards near the elevator. Getting to the place felt like a treasure hunt. It was so worth it. The place was beautiful, the night view is amazing. The sangria was amazing. The kitchen was down the time I went because of heat, so we could only get the nachos which was still great. Loved everything about it. I can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=Taj1GRWT5Az8yRsYw-77Fg,Garima K.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"This terrace bar was a suggestion by our tour guide. And as she rightly said, not many people knew about this amazing roof top bar with a 180degree view of Downtown Montreal! The space was semi full and did not look crowded. Just that there are no menus here and no food options. Its a great place to chill with a couple of drinks and look at the amazing view!"
/user_details?userid=qGSrT9FfUZAgY-Jm2Co9sQ,Roger K.,"Clifton Park, NY",5 star rating,"Atop of Auberge Vieux Port is a wonderful terrace with a spectacular view of Old Montreal and its Port.  We had been here a few years ago and were blown away by a White Sangria we were served using white wine, lychee and white cranberry juice.  We returned this year and were hoping for a repeat enjoyment.Yes, they still offered a White Sangria, but it was prepared differently (insert sad face here).  But wait, there's more!  There was now a Clear Sangria on the menu that was made with Prosecco, white cranberry juice, and peach Schnapps.  Just had to try this!  We ordered a pitcher ($50) and some food.  The Clear Sangria was fantastic (insert happy face here).Since we were sharing the Sangria we also shared the Grilled Cheese Canard ($18) and Tartare de Crevettes ($26).  The duck grilled cheese was delicious and came with chips and some salad. The shrimp tartare was fresh, tasty, and came with some toasted baguette slices and more of the salad that was with the grilled cheese.It can get a little cramped with everyone wanting to be on the roof on a beautiful day.  Our server, Marie Noel, took excellent care of us.  Our water and sangria glasses were kept filled throughout our stay.As a final note, we found out just a little too late, that the terrace at the hotel we actually were staying at, The Nelligan, a sister hotel of Auberge Vieux Port, was serving a White Sangria with lychee!  Oh well, next trip!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"This is the roof top terrace with the MOST BEAUTIFUL views of Old Montreal, its port, the majestic river and surroundings!!! I wish I can give the bar four stars out of six. The drinks were not very consistent. The first round of sangrias was not as strong as I would like it, besides the fact the white wine sangria with orange juice was a little bit strange combination, but that was my choice in the end. Second round of drinks was much stronger, the clear sangria was definitely a better choice as well as the mojito royal. There is a nice choice of snacks and some main course options on the menu, we shared the cheese platter that was not very big, but enough for two. I wish we were told what are the Quebec cheeses we had, not that I normally remember them, but it gives a nice touch, particularly when you have so many tourists in the bar. Service was overall efficient and nice. This spot is absolutely perfect to watch the shows of the International Fireworks Fest. The owners know it and they charge an extra of 25 dollars if you stay after eight on a fireworks night. I would definitely recommend the bar to Montrealers and visitors because of the stunning views. Try to arrive before sunset, every moment is precious as the light changes. Just get a drink and enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=-ShdX4pDKrldKfic9rHhSQ,Alex P.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"OK so I have been these four tresses Nelligan, William Gray, Place D'Armes, and Sur L'Auberge. They are all within 5min walk of each other and all almost the same, I wonder if they are operated by the same company? Here is my dilemma, the settings are great for all of them nice view and good ambiance, the food and drinks however severely lacking especially for the price! So I am ranking Neligan as the best (4 stars) - best drinks and ambiance! The other 3 all get three stars because...15 dollars a drink and it tastes like they poured a premade cocktail mix... and the food is very lacking $20 dollar lobster role on a chewy dry hot dog bun with little scraps of lobster claw! Although I should say that the drinks and bartender quality is better at Neligan and so is the ambiance!I will post the same review for all four places."
/user_details?userid=pEMWzZ8qWY1T_K0HUoKDIA,Hope C.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,"Gorgeous view, less than average drinks. $29 for two Moscow mules -- too sweet, not well balanced. Loved the view from the top and our server was quick and quite nice, but the prices were too high for the product. Probably would grab a drink in Gaspar over this place the next time."

/user_details?userid=5i8f_qKmYjBuRODEa_XQMw,Carolyn T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for after dinner drinks on Saturday evening of the Labour Day weekend. We were just walking along St. Paul when we happened upon a sign directing us to the best view of Old Montreal. A series of signs led us to a back door of Taverne Gaspar and through to the lobby of the Auberge du Vieux Port. A short elevator ride later and we found ourselves on the rooftop terrasse, where we were treated to a stunning panoramic view of Old Montreal and the St. Lawrence while we sipped on our (predictably overpriced) drinks. Price-aside though, the drinks (we ordered several of the sangrias) were excellent. My favourite was the bubbly sangria  (mousseux, Pineau des Charentes, white cranberry juice), which was unique, strong, and beautifully presented.Bottom line: An awesome place to spend a evening with friends."

/user_details?userid=fM5cikNs7zDXVJ0nlXAjag,Mike W.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"This Roof top is made for day drinking, great spot! Great view of the river and surrounding Montreal. This was the best place for day drinking we found in Montreal. Service can be slow if they're slammed, but servers were cool, we came here with a bachelor party. Cocktails and beers were solid."
/user_details?userid=30KOfa7mjweFwJ7QVNx5RA,Barbara M.,"Park Ridge, IL",1 star rating,Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order for a beer and a glass of wine. Not rocket science. Waited another 15 and gave up. Walked out right behind another couple equally frustrated by not just poor service but complete lack of service.
/user_details?userid=R1PCyy2n0NLWr1NlTz4fmQ,Lara P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Beautiful views of the city. Came here for drinks only to capture the view and it is beautiful.  There is not much of a party crowd since everyone here seems to be a tourist but highly recommend it for drinks.  Staff is used to turnover so you will get in and out as quickly as you want.
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The view from the rooftop is gorgeous ! We went to eat and drink but also watch the fireworks. Be prepared to pay $25 extra per person after 9pm ! If you don't mind the price then it is definitely worth checking out. It's romantic! For those on a budget,  it's pricy and the view of the fireworks is just as nice at the clock tower or elsewhere. They do play the music that goes with the fireworks so that's nice. If you go early enough do try to sit along the edge so that you can get a better view of the fireworks. Beware that the railing is filled with spiders and spider webs so don't get too close. I had the cucumber gin basil drink and the lobster roll. The lobster rolls were good. Instead of one big lobster roll it was two tiny buns. It came with homemade potato chips and salad. My friend had the duck confit grilled cheese with cheese , apple puree and spinach. It also came wit homemade potato chips and salad."
/user_details?userid=B70Ow_psWWj2S8jxJqz8ZQ,Medjinne D.,"Bronx, NY",4 star rating,"We came here on our weekend trip to Montreal. We really stopped for some drinks and it had a great view of the Vieux Port. I can't say much about the food since we really just had drinks. But the only hiccup was when we asked to move to another table before we ordered and was told that the restaurant policy ask that we not move once seated to avoid issues, which we said ok to. Then two seconds later the couple next to us moved to the very same table and we were told that since we did not insist they got the table......WHAT?!? but any way we let it go we were on our little getaway and was not about to start any issue with that. Well needless to say the couple changed their mind and left so we moved to that table. Tip to management: be consistent."
/user_details?userid=xahq_WAFi6SYHFdwYVfVkg,Lo M.,"Charlotte, NC",2 star rating,"We were looking for a nice outdoor terrace on a lovely Saturday afternoon and based on the reviews came to Terrasse sur l'Auberge. If you are coming for drinks, 3 of 5 stars; the view, 5 of 5; food, 1 of 5. The rooftop is a bit crowded, staff was average. They don't have much of a food selection even though the menu is ""tapas""... our steak was well done (not by request), chewy, and not flavorful - we didn't finish it. For reference: I'm from the States, travel frequently, and eat out at least 4 times/week."
/user_details?userid=wP7ZjkdA2LGbDNWJKrhNgQ,Brainfisch H.,"Ville-Marie, Canada",4 star rating,The rooftop bar in the Auberge du vieux port has just opened last week. There are currently only small Tapas on the menu but the wines are fine and the service is very helpful and friendly.In addition you get excellent views of the St. Lawrence stream and the harbour and the city. Very nice for sundowners.
/user_details?userid=EOgls9I_SXTz0mRsbfnE4w,Ed Y.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Difficult place to find but worth the search because of the view. The view is really nice but that is all. We ordered 4 pitchers of sangrias for the 4 of us (the sangrias were really weak). The service is slow. We had to order the next pitcher when the waiter brought the current pitcher so that by the time we finished the sangria the next one would arrive just in time. We order some appetizers and they were nothing special. We shared a platter of dips and a charcuterie (nothing exciting to brag about). Also, the sangrias were really expensive. You are better off going somewhere for drinks and food before coming here to enjoy the view."
