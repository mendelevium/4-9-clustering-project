I think they have max 10 tables. I was able to snatch a booming last Saturday for our party of 10. There are two sittings. 5:30-8pm and 8:30-11pm. They are very strict about these times as the staff eats in between two sittings so the restaurant is closed. Only two waiters but the Service was good and efficient. I had the tilapia ceviche and this was my favourite dish of the night. The fish was so fresh and the sauce was tangy and just perfect. I also tried the shrimp tacos the steak tacos and the tortilla rolls (enmoladas)The steak was a bit tough - I added the foie gras mayo and it made it a lot less dry. The shrimp tacos were the best out of the 3. The enmoladas are very special they are covered in a sort of chocolate sauce which is different but I wouldn't order this again. I got to taste the creme brûler and it was very good. They offered the birthday girl her meal which was a very nice gesture. I would go back and try other dishes for sure because the prices are very good and it's a bring your own wine which is amazing.
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"7/10 Cozy and charming BYOB in the plateau. Overall experience was pretty good but I was disappointed with my main course- read more below :-)I had the salmon tartare as an entre which was very yummy with different kind of garnishing, tastes and colours. It was also well presented. My friend had ceviche which was so so. As the main course, I had the steak which was quite disappointing as it had too much sauce and wasn't well spiced and the meat really wasn't tender. My "" steak bar "" is quite high so I am not easily satisfied with a regular steak at any restaurant. I should have known better and ordered something more along the lines of Peruvian/ Mexican cuisine. You live, you eat and you learn.Despite the steak, I will give them another chance. Stay tuned for an update :-)"

My first reaction was: what's the catch?? This Mexican restaurant is small with simple decor and minimal kitch, and is nestled in a corner of the plateau near an SAQ: how convenient!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and our waitress was quick to serve and friendly.We opted for the 6 course tasting menu and everything was pleasantly delicious; from the poblano soup to the ceviche and tacos, each course was tastier than the last, beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. My dinning partner surprised me with a seventh dish of cricket taco?!! Ambivalent at first, I would say it was my favourite dish of all, and nothing like I expected. The tangy and chewy crickets, soft avocado, pickled onions and slightly sweetened salsa on a perfect corn tortilla made for a perfect pocket of pure pleasure..;) I especially liked that the waitress took taking the time to explain every one of the dishes prepared by the very talented chef Ali. I would return for a great meal at a low cost once the menu changes up, which it does so seasonally. I think this restaurant has the potential of being more, if they add a little class to the table and maybe a fresh paint of colour on the walls to liven it up from it's drab interior but overall, I really enjoyed this space, the food and the service."

Overall, I really enjoyed the food. The soup was okay, but I'm very picky with my soups. The tacos however were delicious and the ceviche was to die for. If you come here, you HAVE to try their foie gras mayo, I can't even describe how good it was. The portions seemed a little small, but this is understandable because it was an event. It is also a BYOB which is a plus. I'm very interested in coming back here to try their regular menu and will definitely edit my comment and recommendations once I do so."

The decor is casual but cute, the ambiance is relaxing, the service is great and their prices are extremely affordable. The food is great, I really like their take on ceviche and its presentation. My carne asada was juicy and delicious. It's a great place to have a dinner with friends or family and I'll definitely will be coming back there again!"

/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Yay! I finally got to check it out - and I love it!This little restaurant with large glass windows intrigued my imagination for a few months now.  It's elegant simplicity of decor as well as dishes is quite the find!It's not anything extravagant, yet you get a fantastic dining experience for a small price - just what you look for in a typical neighbourhood restaurant. The food is mildly spicy, not hot at all, and the staff seems to take pride in what comes under their hands. We had a wonderful three course meal that included the soup of the day, a Tacos dish, and dessert (Flan).It didn't look like a big meal, but I actually left very satisfied!The soup was very interesting - every bite had different bits and pieces that wonderfully complemented the tomato and chicken broth based soup - avocado, coriander, tortilla bits - every bite uncovered new tastes and textures. Each of the tacos dishes included four tacos and small bowls of rice and beans. Our initial response was that it looks like very little rice and beans - but we realised that these go in the tacos, and you really don't need much. A squeeze of lime on top and wow! Tasty! I really liked the pickled onion that was on top of my steak tacos.The flan was OK. I probably would not order it if it wasn't already included in the table d'hôte (but I finished mine all the same!).Service was reasonably quick and very attentive. We got all the answers to our questions about the menu with a smile. The vegetarian selection is highly limited, and my partner feels like she has exhausted it, but I would be happy to return and sample some more dishes.It's a bring-your-own-wine. Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=Z0r3DMEFAdpIzd7AEzqyrQ,Chavi S.,"Long Sault, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant has the perfect mix of casual, affordable dining with great service and ambiance. The combination of Mexican and Peruvian cuisine was great and you can enjoy the night without thinking about the final bill. Defiantly one to make your new local eatery in the plateau!"
/user_details?userid=WtOR8KPRt2fKCdJvNmOxKQ,Sandra M.,"Lachine, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was really looking forward to this meal since I had heard so much about this restaurant.  I was so disappointed.   Two friends and I had a reservation on the coldest night of the year (-38) with the windchill.  We arrived 20 minutes before our 8:30 reservation and we were not allowed in even though the restaurant was practically empty.  There were 2 patrons left from the first service.  We had to wait outside in the frigid cold. This is inhumane.  Once we finally sat down it didn't get any better.  We were very tightly squeezed together, uncomfortably so.  We had a 6 course meal.  The soup was really good but then it went downhill. The portions were tiny. When one of us asked for some hot sauce we were told that they don't have anything that will mask the taste of the food. No bread available either.  The dessert, creme brule with fois gras was inedible. We all left hungry and took a cab to a hotdog joint a few blocks away.  I do not recommend this pretentious restaurant."
