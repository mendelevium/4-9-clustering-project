/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"(Visited 12/16/2019.) Staying in Montréal again for work, but in a different section this week so that means new restaurants are within walking distance! This place has great reviews so I figured I'd check it out! Here's how it went.Atmosphere/Appearance: This quaint restaurant is located right downtown so you'll have to find your own street parking unless you can locate a garage somewhere or just walk like me! Lol. Once in the door you'll see the place is really quite narrow, but it adds to the allure. On the left side is the open kitchen where everything is prepared and there are small booths lined up on the right side. The ceilings are high so it certainly makes the space feel a lot more open. The decor is traditional and very modern/chic. I really liked the calm, serene atmosphere of this place.Service: Michael took care of us and was everything we needed him to be.Food: I'm a big fan of tapas or small plates for that matter. So I stuck to the appetizer menu so that I could check out multiple ends of the spectrum to see what this restaurant can do! Of course I had some hot saké, two of them to be exact and it was delicious. I started off with some karaage which is basically Japanese style fried chicken thighs and you get 10 pieces. They were tender, hot and served with a delicious garlicky cream sauce. Next up I had the edamame which was delightfully salty, simple and of course, healthy! Third came the hotate tempura which is a scallop battered in light tempura batter served with salt, lime, lemon and soy sauce. I had never had it before and it was fantastic! Definitely give that a try. Lastly, I tried the Yakiniku Hanger Steak which is sliced medium-rare hanger steak, Yakiniku sauce, wasabi-chimichurri served over rice. It was fantastic and the best thing I had!Value: (All prices in $CAD.)Hot saké = $13.00Edamame = $5.00Karaage = $10.00Hotate Tempura = $12.00Yakiniku Hanger Steak = $19.00Not a cheap place, but not terribly expensive either! The food was absolutely worth it and definitely a good place for a date, business meeting or just a good meal.In conclusion, I'm a big fan of Marusan and for good reason! I loved everything about this place and can certainly see myself visiting here again the next time I'm in town."

We got the menu and it was straightforward with appetizers, main course and desserts. We got the takoyaki for our appetizer, it was deep fried and it was crispy but that is not how it supposed to be. It tasted doughy with a piece of octopus's tentacles inside. Flavor was good but definitely I don't recommended this. The main course, we got a udon noodle and chef selected fish on top of rice. The udon was regular, you can get it in most places. The raw fish in the chef selected was fresh. It might look small but it actually can fill you up. You should definitely get it. Overall it was good."
/user_details?userid=ZT-YOtB443BdjPbd2WHEJw,Mitchell L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent food with a unique vibe near old Montréal. I was looking for some decent Japanese food in the area and was so glad I stumbled into Marusan. The food was excellent and also priced decently. I ordered the '3 kinds Sashimi' which included salmon, albacore and scallops; all the slices tasted very fresh. I also ordered the 'Oyster Isobe-Age Udon' and given that I'm a huge fan of soup noodles and have a relatively higher standard when it comes to soup noodles, I was still impressed by the udon. The broth was sweet and the oyster was a nice addition to the dish. The atmosphere of the place is also very interesting and almost feels as if you entered a hidden bar. Overall, I would definitely recommend and I'll be coming back next time I visit Montréal!"

We ordered the gailan in yuzu sesame sauce, Akashi style takoyaki (takoyaki in dashi broth), salmon and bluefin toro sashimi (very fresh, perfectly sized pieces), uni pressed sushi (so good we had to order another order), bluefin tuna pressed sushi (delicious), Dan Dan udon, and the blondie brownie for desert.Food was great, service was great, and the Japanese highball (Japanese whiskey with soda and a twist of lime) was on point.Ambiance was cozy with great tunes!"

They already knew my friend well enough to know exactly what food and drinks we wanted. They even brought over some special fancy new saké they had just gotten in (not for free, we paid for everything, we're not THAT fancy).Is that going to skew my review? Of course! Even though we got extra great service because they were friends with my friend, I don't doubt that these people are just generally lovely and kind to everyone.Of course, the food was incredible. Did I mention the truffle egg? It came in a little bathtub, which you tip into your mouth like a big hungry giant. We had so many other wonderful things to share but... forgive me... we had a lot of saké and now I only remember three things:1. The saké tasting menu was AMAZING and well worth it 2. The overall food experience, service, and atmosphere were so good that I can't wait to go back3. Truffle eggI sincerely hope this is enough of a review to convince you to go here, get drunk, and order ten thousand truffle eggs per person."

My cousin and I were checking out the movie Bad Boys and wanted to grab a bite before heading in. We weren't overly hungry so we  just grabbed 2 Ramen vegetable classic soup with pork. We were both dIsapoointed  because  the vegetables were only 2 bamboo shoots in the soup. The soup was way too salty. The positive thing was the Ramen noodles were thin and light. I found $15 to be over priced for some noodles without veggies. I've heard they have some good food on the menu, I will definitely give it a second chance if I want Japanese style food."
/user_details?userid=US2ut_Ri7MpObqB4sCMn4w,Burj S.,"Boca Raton, FL",3 star rating,Came by after seeing the Yelp reviews with the family.  We were seated immediately and our server was a very enthusiastic and helpful young man and the main reason that this joint even got 3 stars!Firstly the seating was a bit cramped for the four of us.  Secondly a lot of the items we saw on the Yelp favorite dish list had been discontinued ( I was so looking forward to the Pork Katsu Curry.We ordered several appetizers which were just OK nothing to rave about our main courses were OK too and the portions were not generous.Overall the meal was on the pricey side and even though I hate not appreciating our meal all I can say is that we love good Japanese food but this place did not cut it!Service     Ambiance Food          Overall 3      Next we'll explore another place!
/user_details?userid=l6y1_khn2V29gzu_srRlIQ,Grace Y.,"Temple City, CA",4 star rating,"Craving sashimi? Definitely get the 7 piece blue fin tuna toro sashimi. It's a good break from all the heavy food from this city. The seven generous portions of flavorful and fatty toro are of top quality. The  Unagidon with ikura- bbq eel, shimeji, salmon caviar, poached egg on rice is a more filling dish. The presentation is magnificent with attention to every detail to deliver a flawless panting in the bowl. If you're wanting a soft texture rice dish, you'll get that with this dish with the fatty eel, rice, caviar that's not too salty and the poached egg all mixed together. We also got the tofu with the wild mushroom. The mushroom was excellent with the sauce and the radish and wasabi. Wasn't a fan of the tofu. While the mushroom was fried nicely, the tofu needed to be fried a bit longer. I ended up spitting out the gooey batter on each piece. I didn't see the curry dishes from the other posts but those looked really good. The place is small but very nice. I'm always a sucker for good service so this place for an extra start for the super friendly service with the top notch Japanese courteousness."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really enjoyed this place. Food was delicious! Ordered: tuna tataki, fatty tuna giant roll, beef tataki over rice, fried chicken (karaage), and a veggie dish. Everything was good. For two people and it was more than enough. Beautiful and hip venue. The evening I went, they also had a Sake brand rep (for Masumi) visiting from Japan. Offered a Sake tasting along with plenty of info on the company. Was great fun. More generally, they have a great offering of Sakes (even some on tap!).Once a month, they also host a sake & vinyl event at night at their resto. Haven't tried yet but will someday!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"So difficult to rate, not a four star experience, but not a three stars either. Marusan is a trendy Japanese joint, with somewhat uncomfortable seats that due to lack of proper support may help you work out your posture during the dinner. We made reservation for Monday and this seems to be a good move as most of the restos at the Old Port are closed during this day of the week thus Marusan was really busy. Making a reservation does not guarantee a best seat in the house, we ended up at the very bottom of the narrow space, which deprived us of really feeling the atmosphere of the place. Food wise we had a relatively nice experience. I have been dreaming for Japanese udon noodles for years, yet I did not end up getting them as was to much tempted by the raw fish. We started with agadashi tofu topped with Japanese mushroom tempura, truly outstanding. Attracted by the blue fin tuna we had both toro and akami sashimi, which were amazing, we didn't like the cut as it was half of a regular piece of sashimi, but still delicious taste and texture. This lead us to order more fish, the five kinds of sashimi that included again toro, this time a real size cuts, which were even better, but the rest except for the catch of the day were subpar. The barbecue eel over rice dish is not a complicated one and was quite good. The sake selection of Marusan is pretty solid and we definitely enjoyed it. Service was a little bit above average. We had to wait for sake attention with empty glasses and even for attention in general. When the five sashimi plate arrived I had to wave the the guy back to explain what is the fish I couldn't recognize instead of him simply highlighting what has been served as a catch of the day. Unfortunately the bathroom is way below the standard cleanliness of the Japanese ones or those pretending to be part of high end joints. Prices are relatively high, but I may be back as I still need my udon noodles fix."

Lunch is quick-service, order at the counter and they bring it. It's just phenomenally fresh, tasty, and generous portions. The spot is VERY cool and has a dope little vibe.When the borders open up I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",2 star rating,"I really like tasting menus. It lets you try a little bit of everything. So when I found this tasting menu for $78/two people and great reviews, I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, the entire experience was just a two-star one. Half the food was good (nothing amazing) and the other half was meh. On top of that, the service was SO slow. They didn't really check on us, even if we were trying to flag someone to get their attention. It wasn't even that busy there on a Saturday night at around 9, so I'm not sure why our table was neglected.Anyway, here is what the tasting menu included:Tuna tataki - nice start to the menu, but it was like a rollercoaster after thatGomaae (Japanese spinach salad with sesame dressing) - the spinach was chewy, but I liked the dressingSashimi (hamachi, salmon, and scallop) - no complaints here. The best one was probably the scallopOnsen Tamago (poached egg with truffle) - this wasn't bad. Could have used some more truffle flavor in it thoughSurf and turf tempura (scallop tempura and mushroom tempura) - this was a little oily but it was alright. Toro sushi (4 pieces for 2 people) - probably the best of the whole night. I could have used more of this and less of the other stuffBlondie - we were forced to pick this because they ran out of the tofu dessert option. This was pretty bad. It was a blondie with vanilla ice cream (standard), but then they added caramel and yuzu. It just did not go well togetherWe also ordered one of the specials, some kind of seared bluefin sushi. It was 2 pieces for $16 and totally not worth it. I think it was just tuna that was probably about to go bad so that's why they had to sear it and put it on their ""specials"" menu.It seems they do raw fish well. So just stick to that, avoid the cooked foods, or any ""specials"", and you'll be fine (if you're also fine with slow service)."
/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"The food here was good but way too expensive. Right now Marusan is denoted $$ on Yelp, but it's more on the $$$ side because prices are high and portions are small. I got the unagidon (eel over rice) which was $26 and good but small, even for my small Asian girl stomach. My boyfriend asked how big the ramen was, and the waiter said ""About 1/3 of a meal"" which was unfortunately accurate. My friend got a salad and the DIY sushi party which was over $30, which is a lot to pay when you're wrapping your own sushi. And if I spend $68 just for two people (we split the bill), at least I want to be full, which we weren't at all."
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After a year or so, I'm back! The menu tripled and I was happy about it.Had their tonkatsu curry. The curry tastes normal, probably just the usual packaging curry with some slight adjustments. The tonkatsu was amazing! Most of the time I avoid tonkatsu because usually they give very fatty porc. It was crispy on the outside and tender inside. The meat was perfect, just enough fat to taste good.Can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu."

/user_details?userid=ma6206bmu-a_Ja7Iv-yRCw,Sharon M.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Marusan, I should be calling you Maru-senpai, because you know how to treat a girl right!! I feel wined and dined...even after paying for the meal! I mean, an omakase for 2 people for $75? That's practically a steal. Next thing you know, I'll be inviting Marusan in for a late-night coffee ;) My lovely girlfriends treated me to Marusan as the first step of a bachelorette's evening in Montreal. Ooooh did I feel special. Free sake shots for the table? My first drink on the house? Marusan sure knew how to get a bunch of girls excited very quickly. Got the amazing Shiso Mojito, bursting with bright leafy flavour, and extremely refreshing on such a hot day. The best drinks serve to elevate the best foods and that food was bomb! Like I said, about $35 per person for omakase is an absolute steal. Six courses that included assorted fresh sashimi, deep-fried whole wings, torched sushi, a satisfying protein dish, and dessert. Absolutely adored the torched sea urchin served with the perfect poached egg and bursting salmon roe. Flavourful fatty tuna pressed sushi. Juicy hangar steak. And a decadent blondie to finish. Really, what more can you ask for in a meal?To cap off, discounted cocktails after 8pm! Yuzu and grapefruit sours for all!! And a rousing round of Sake Bombs, led by our lovely waitress, that energized our entire table (and maybe startled a bunch of other customers with our table pounding, oops!) Service was top notch. Free drinks aside, we were constantly checked up on and the staff were super fun. As hot as the weather was outside, and as hot as it was inside the restaurant with their broken AC, we were made to feel so chill with staff and patrons that felt like friends. Marusan is just too cool. I think I'm already head over heels for this one. (56/100) - 2018"
/user_details?userid=3RU_U3HdYU3AOs_r9rgoBg,Alex S.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing quality sushi and great service! I loved how authentic this place is too. I did the tastings menu and the whole meal was an experience. The whole thing is many tapas style dishes brought one after another that compliment each other well. Everything was simply delicious and well worth the money. I'm most definitely coming back when I'm in Montreal again
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We came on a Friday evening. We were wondering near old port and want to rest our feet. I saw the photos of curry and craving for some katsu Curry but the dinner menu is so different. The lunch rice meal is around 11$ and the dinner menu is more like a izakaya one. We had a shrimp appetizer, slow cooked beef tongue curry bowl and pork belly bibimcap. They are both tasty. The curry is flavourful and the meat just melt in your mouth. The bibimcap is spicy and served sizzling hot. Many meat in the bowl. Only one drawback is that the second rice bowl only came after my husband already finished his meal."

Our waitress this time was very nice and cheeky. She was fun to chitchat with which was very pleasant. We ordered cocktails to start. I had the kombu gin tonic and my friend went with the yuzu sour, they were both good. For dinner we went with the sharing omakase menu which consisted of 3 kinds of sashimi, wings, tuna tataki (because they ran out of uni) toro pressed sushi and beef tongue curry. Everything was very yummy. We were absolutely full but still polished off the dessert which was a blondie & ice cream.Still a great place and I'd still come back :)"
/user_details?userid=B5oCQNQd30B-dKuwmN091Q,Samantha M.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"We came to this restaurant twice. Once for dinner, once for lunch. Note that the dinner menu and lunch menu are totally different. We wanted to originally try curry but didn't realize it was only for lunch. For dinner, dinner was really good. I didn't snap a picture of the Karrage (fried chicken) but it looked nothing like the lunch picture when I ordered again. The fried chicken we ordered during dinner was so delicious. Batter was fried to perfection and the chicken was tender and juicy. The scallops and mushroom tempura was also quite delicious. The sauce they gave along with it was hot and that definitely made a difference. There were two different Japanese mushroom. Two pieces of scallops, it was fried quite well. The udon was a little heavy but it was delicious. The pork complemented the udon and the udon's sauce had a little kick of chili oil and truffle oil. They were delicious combined. Dinner was delicious overall. For lunch, it was different and disappointing. We had a Beef Gyu-don and Beef Curry rice with a side of the Karrage.. this Karrage side was disappointing. As you can see in the picture, it was way over fried and the inside was still a little cold. The beef guy-don had a lot of rice and not enough beef. This sucks because there was no sauce or anything which made the white rice alone harder to eat. The Beef curry rice was okay, best out of the three we ordered. The curry was plain, nothing along with it just curry and a little bit of beef on the side too. Nothing special or that delicious. Overall, lunch was pretty terrible compared to dinner. Also, originally the beef tongue curry attracted us to this place because it was different, but it is no longer offered."
/user_details?userid=XXomb4TiYeNT-KcO3tht9A,Jose T.,"Ajax, Canada",5 star rating,"We were visiting Montreal during the Victoria Day long weekend, and this was our dinner on our last night there. 5 stars just for the fact that when we asked for a high chair for our one-yr-old daughter, he sprayed and wiped it down before letting her use it. I've had many instances eating out where the high chairs available just seemed like they never got wiped down properly after the last kid used it, so it was just a really nice gesture for him to do that.Along with the service, their food is excellent! Great depth of flavor in their udon broth, very good chicken karaage, and the tempura was fantastic - clean delicare batter, fried at the right temperature such that you could still taste the delicate natural flavor of the mushrooms. The tamago onsen and the green salad dressing was also very good. If I had to offer one criticism, I did think the chrirashi bowl was a little steep for the portion size and amount of seafood they put on top. But here were a many elements on that dish (including good quality rice, a fresh shiso leaf, and real wasabi root) that can justify the price. I would chalk it up to quality over quantity, but I do get other reviewers when they say they ordered one of the rice bowls but it wouldn't get you ""full"" for the price you pay. I've also traveled to Osaka and Tokyo and at the ¥3,500-4,500 range, you would expect a bowl with toro, crab, or uni. Still, I give this place a wholehearted 5 stars. My kids enjoyed the food, and it was a good break from eating all the heavy smoked meat, poutine, bagels/croissants and maple syrup that we had been eating all weekend.Thanks for the fantastic meal."

Came here for dinner late on a Wednesday night and easily got a seat - it wasn't busy at all but we got there around 8:30PM.We ordered five dishes: guy lan mee oh, agedashi tofu, pork udon, tuna tataki and ice cream mochi for dessert.Every dish was a slight twist on classic Asian food. The guy lan was doused in this sesame-nutty sauce (super tasty with none of the usual bitterness). It's quite small because it's only a starter dish so you could order two if you wanted more veggies. The agedashi tofu broth was delicious! It also came with tempura battered mushrooms which made the dish quite filling. Tuna tataki was also solid and paired really well with their pickled red onion.The pork udon was very interesting and our favourite dish of the night. It was different from usual udon because it was more saucy than brothy. The udon really grows on you - I felt the first bite was a bit too peppery but as you eat more and more you get to tasting more of the truffle and a mild amount of spice. The udon noodle itself was perfectly cooked. I've never tasted udon this way!For five dishes and a beer, after tax and tip, came out to around $75.All in all, great dinner, solid 4/5."

We had the agedashi tofu, 3 kinds of sashimi (9 total pieces), chicken karage (6 pieces), takoyaki (4 pieces), the oyster udon, and the unagi don. The agedashi tofu was a nice starter dish and had some fried mushrooms as well -- super delicious! The sashimi was great and included salmon, tuna, and scallop. They actually upgraded our tuna to a special kind since they ran out of their regular tuna for the dish.Our favourite dish of the night would probably have to be the unagi don -- all the components wonderfully complemented each other and the egg was cooked to perfection.Our server Khoi was super attentive throughout the entire night as well and he even treated each of us to a shot of sake to wrap up the night -- so kind and truly great service! We're really happy we locked in a reservation on the night of!"

Their menu changes often (daily?) But they have a ton of interesting options. One standout we had was tempura brie...I mean how could you go wrong . We also had an octopus salad, a ramen dish and a few other plates. It was definitely good, but a little pricey because the plates are so tiny. For lunch it's a great place to grab some awesome Japanese comfort food. Katsu don, katsu curry, chicken karaage, udon - everything has been very good and it's way cheaper. About $12 ish which is comparable to many surrounding lunch spots. I love grabbing food from here. The space isn't big but you can also sit down and they're generally pretty fast. All in all a solid place with pleasant people who work there."

Sauce was excellent, but I'd rather have pork katsu to go with it (not an option).Kushi Katsu was great. Plenty of panko to make it crispy. Dip them in sauce made it even better. Well done (though, as expected, not as good as the one in Osaka).Overall good place, but price is steep for the ""tapas"" that you get.

At lunch you have a few choices of meal such as the salmon tuna bowl or the curry. They're all around 10-15$ and all very tasty. In the evening, everything changes (when the fire nation attacked...). It becomes one of those noisy izakaya with many more choices on the menu. Their cocktails are also pretty good. The service is great. Our waiter made recommendations and gave me one of those japanese leaves to try because i didnt know what it was and it was in their mojito. Anyway, a good place to go for a quick lunch or to chill after work."

That being said, the portions are tiny... and not that cheap. I hate leaving a place hungry with my wallet feeling exceptionally skinny afterwards. I came with a group of 4 people and ordered the eel over rice, two of the udon dishes, takoyaki, and fried tofu. The eel and the tofu were both flavorful, but the udon dishes were pretty bland. The takoyaki was just okay. Even though we ordered two types of udon, they tasted extremely similar. We also wanted to get the uni, which was about $12 CAD. They didn't have enough for a full serving, so the staff was very gracious in giving us what was left for free. While we really appreciated the free dish, the uni has a strong fishy taste to it. I'm not sure if this place is known for their sushi, but I would recommend going that route as the noodle and rice dishes weren't very memorable."

Staff is really courteous and the place is nicely set up ( better than food court). I usually get the spicy tuna and the salmon sushi and I am satisfied.

Beautiful small place with an efficient and slightly above average service from the staff.Ive only ever had udon in this stew or in ramen, but MARUSAN has one swimming in a rich clear miso soup. The plate was generous and very filling. The yuzu gives it more texture and edge, the sweet flavour cuts through the umami. It would've been perfect if the tempura came in a separate plate so that it wouldn't soak up all the soup the moment it came to the table and became all soggy. The edamame were a bit too salty for our tastebud but all in all lovely and deliciously wonderful food."

Having read so many amazing reviews, I walked in with very high expectations. Hubby and I ordered the spicy chicken karaage, udon noodles curry, fried mushroom skewers and spicy tuna sushi. The udon dish was quite flavourful and the chicken was alright. What I wasn't impressed by, was the service. The customer service was horrible. Hence, the 3 stars. Also, don't think we will be going back."

The gyu don was thinly sliced beef over rice plus a poached egg for 1.5 more. The curry was good as well. For a price ~26CAD for 2, it was a great lunch that didn't leave you feeling heavy or tired!

What can I say, Japanese food is usually a hit with me so I decided to try out this place located in the old port. The whole set up of the place is done so that you order upfront and sit down like a fast food place. Unlike most fast food places, this place is actually good... very good.I got the poke (didn't know there was a Japanese variation of this Hawaiian dish) and a plate of karaage. Both dishes were very good and flavourful, especially the poke - which knocked it over the park. It was spicy, sweet and salty all together.

The food was only okay to my shock and disappointment. Marusan, we thought you could do much better!! I had two other people who were fans and were seriously excited to have you guys for lunch but ended up somewhat underwhelmed by the lunch as well. For some reason the presentation was average and the food was delivered too early so it was cold by the time we ate it. The chicken in the EBI-TERI BENTO was just brown but not an attractive, glossy brown. Just brown. The ""salad"" was just a few leafs of spring mix lettuce and really sad and lonely for a salad...maybe because their lettuce leaf friends were still hanging out in the salad box at the resto kitchen? They're truly a good resto, no doubt.  But it didn't go so well with the catering sadly.  I wish it could've been as great as an experience as it were in the resto cause now my colleagues aren't impressed with my choice of food!"

Got the Hickson IPA to pair. The udon was dope, great recommendation by our waitress. Sushi was a bit smaller in portion than we expected, and the ramen didn't have much broth as we were hoping. Nevertheless, great meal and would definitely come back for a fix of modern Japanese. Great for groups, dates, solo meals, and everything in between!"

If not, the owner should come back from whatever beach in Tahiti he is at and monitor this restaurant.  Deserves negative stars.Addendum after reading owner's answer:  We came here last year and had an amazing experience at your restaurant.  My review is not the result of not understanding your ""concept;"" it's due to the horrible service and poor quality food.  Because of our first experience. we came to your restaurant expecting the same amazing experience.  We were going to come for dinner but rushed for lunch instead because we loved your food the first time.  I actually told the man that we were unhappy with the beef bowl and THAT would have been the time for a refund, not after the fact.  The review is not to get money back from you.  It is so you can fix the problems with your restaurant before others have the same awful experience and never come back.i"

Every time me and my friends are trying to figure out where to eat, this place always pops into my head first because it is hands down one of the best Japanese restaurants in town. The style of food is Japanese comfort food elevated to a more elegant and refined level. This may not be your most fancy restaurant, it may not be the most standard in terms of its dishes, but no matter what kind of vibe you're in it'll definitely please, whether it's an intimate date or friendly gathering.There's a standard menu and a handwritten special menu which changes all the time - for appetizer I highly recommend the agedashi tofu and the hanger steak. The steak is cooked perfectly and really tasty. For main course I recommend the beef tongue curry - super tender and flavorful (and you can get the vege if you're vegetarian). Don't forget to get the Japanese Blondie for desert, the combination of caramel, Yuzu citrus and the brownie... I can't even put into words how good it is.The Chef Hire really knows his stuff and the staff are so warm and welcoming, shout out to Koi!"

It took us 1 hours to find a spot, at which point we were 25 mins late to our reservation, but Marusan was kind enough to held our spot after we called to inform them.Food over all were very good. We preferred the pressed salmon over the mackerel. The clams were excellent. The hamachi carpaccio was not a hit with us as it tasted more Chinese than Japanese, with the chili oil. One comment about the service was they should have paced the food as it was a tiny table and since we ordered six items and they all came at once, we neither had the real estate on the table nor the time to eat the food while some of them were hot. (Hence for my not perfect score). Like the last time we were there, the owner? Offered free sake shots, very nice gesture, unfortunately I just don't like sake. My partner enjoyed it though!

I settled for the pre-packed sushi boxes (salmon/avocado roll and spicy tuna roll) and onigiri (salmon and tuna mayo) from the fridge at the front of the restaurant instead. It was fresh and affordable, with lots of flavour. The rice wasnt firm or hard even after being in the fridge. Would have loved to try their donburi or bento box but no luck this time.

I started with torched uni with a poached egg and salmon caviar, then a green salad with a light, citrusy yuzu dressing and finally a bowl of mapo tofu ramen that I will dream about for a long time.

While the service is A1 and the atmosphere is great, I wasn't impressed with the food. I had their sashimi bowl with rice and ikura, it comes with a chef's selection of sashimis; I had salmon, albacore, hotategai (which is the scallop), maguro and another one that I forgot, in my plate. For every kind of fish, they gave 3 pieces. For the price, I don't know if it was really worth it, as it was 32$. I was left feeling unfulfilled and I was still hungry, and I usually get full very quickly. The best thing I ate there is probably the little entree with the poached egg and the sea urchin ( you have to pay an extra 7$ for the urchin though). Would I come back?

The only spot where you can find tasty, pretty authentic and original Japanese izakaya style dishes and simple curry lunches. The staff is awesome, by far the friendliest in the whole neighbourhood.

/user_details?userid=igrxfeD2O9hnz5BHWIO2gA,Tomoko L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"So happy to find some authentic Japanese food in downtown!  Seems very popular among office employees and Japanese people who've heard there's now a place for homey food.  We went there for lunch during the weekday and it was busy, but there were plenty of seats available because some customers place orders to go and eat at their office.  Luckily the line was fast and our food arrived to our table so quickly.  We ordered Katsudon (rice bowl topped with deep-fried pork cutlet, egg and veggies) and Kaisendon (rice bowl topped with sashimi raw fish) and they were both really, really good.  The materials seemed fresh and the flavors reminded me of Tokyo.  In Montreal, I don't know any other place that serves donburi or ""bowl dishes"" such as Katsudon Tonkatsu or Katsu Curry-don, so we gave those dish a try and were happy we did. Love the atmosphere which is bright with natural light.  The interior is modern and warm with clean white walls.  The owner of the restaurant is also Japanese and he was out there, greeting us and other customers.  I would go back and try other things on the menu :)  Prices were good.  Can not wait to come back here for dinner as well.   Highly recommended!!"

/user_details?userid=8mRP99GIXW1tAJFI6C-MwQ,Alysia L.,"Edmonton, Canada",1 star rating,"I was excited to try this ""authentic"" izakaya restaurant out after one of my friends tried it and loved it. I made a res here to celebrate with my best friend and husband and baby who are visiting from out of town.We were seated promptly and offered a high chair (great so far! But went downhill quickly) We ordered some beers to start off while we looked at the menu. The waitress came by and suggested we order a few dishes to start off with and then add more as we go.We decided on the edamame, chicken kaarage and the 5 kinds of sashimi platter (salmon, scallop, albacore, hamachi and spot prawn). The edamame was overly salted but it was fine since you can scrape off the extra salt to your taste. Chicken kaarage was nice and crispy and the mayo was flavourful and spicy.At this point, the waitress came back and we ordered 4 more dishes and another round of drinks. Then the sashimi came out and it didn't look like what we ordered so we asked a server why there was no spot prawn or hamachi and instead two other types of fish. The server then explained that they changed the sashimi platter recently. But the menu did not reflect this nor did the waitress say anything when she took the order or dropped off the plate to us. Then we asked if they had any spot prawn sashimi left (because that's why we ordered it and it was listed as a separate menu item too) and he said he'd go check. He came back and said the spot prawn they received wasn't fresh and these other fish they replaced it with was fresher. It would have been nice to be told this either as we ordered or as they brought the plate out so we could decide if we wanted to order it or not as 2/5 of the sashimi was not what was advertised.After we finished this, we waited 30 mins with no food coming out even though we had ordered more dishes already and the same waitress who took our order came over and asked us if we'd like to order more food. We told her she already took our order for more food and it hasn't come out yet (she totally didn't remember). She apologized and said she'd check on it and it'd be right out. 10 mins pass and she did not come back but another server came over to clear our table and we asked him again if the food was still coming. He didn't know so he went to find our waitress who tells us the food was coming out right now (it wasn't). We asked her what happened and she said their order ticket printer ran out of paper and it just so happened when they replaced the paper, it skipped our order. And she said this happens every two weeks or so and is super frustrating (hello?? If it happens every two weeks shouldn't you do something to fix this reoccurring issue?). She then goes again to check on our food. So in fact the order was not ready as they didn't even have the order in the kitchen! Then another server came by so we told him if the food hasn't been started yet we'd rather cancel the order since we'd been there over an hour already (and had a hungry baby with us).We get the bill and it's $80 for our drinks and 3 appetizers (the waitress took off one beer as an apology to us which was a nice gesture but didn't make up for the ruined dinner celebration). The waitress could have easily put our order to the kitchen immediately after we brought it to her attention the first time. It's just super disappointing that we were trying to treat our friends who were visiting us from out of town to a celebratory meal and it ended up being super disappointing and even embarrassing (everyone was joking about how hungry they were). Especially disappointing when your friends are only here for the weekend and we wasted a Friday night dinner on this when we could have gone to any one of the other excellent restaurants in this city! I was excited to bring more friends here but can't support a restaurant who's so incredibly incompetent and disorganized even if they can make great food (if it ever makes it in front of you)."

The kitchen is kind of open concept so you know there's nothing shady going on behind the walls. Do the sake tasting - the owner/chef Hide knows his sake and you'll learn to fall in love with it. They also have other cool Japanese inspired drinks, like the Ippon which is a Japanese beer brewed in Quebec! On late weekend nights you'll get to jam out to Hide's awesome DJing.

When we were outside trying to find the restaurant we thought we were going to a club. There were bouncers outside. Then realizing the club and restaurant was right next to each other. Once I opened the door, the music was very loud like I was going clubbing THAT loud. They probably turned the music on high volume to block out the music next door so I didn't mind it. But the experience was just interesting. The service was good, but I did not enjoy the food. The dish were small and pricey. Ordered udon dish and the Bibimbob. On the menu, Udon was not specify if it was soup base or if they were stir fry. Ordered it and it came out somewhat soup base. It kind of look like just peanut  sauce because it was thick and creamy. The sauce and noodle ratio was not well balanced.When I order a Bibimbob i expect to have hot sauce with it. But this was not the case. Overall, the food is like a fusion dish."

Service was absolutely fantastic and so friendly -- the staff here really make you feel welcome in their fine establishment. We ordered the torched mackerel, yellow tail sashimi which had some spicy chili oil, microgreens, and peanuts on it, the BBQ eel bibimbap, and the yuzu ramen. The torched mackerel was mindblowing. I think the server mentioned that they marinate the mackerel in a mixture to get that complexity of flavour. Honestly, it's a beautiful mouthful after mouthful with this dish. The yellow tail sashimi was a great, melt-in-your-mouth texture and the kick from the chili oil was fantastic. The BBQ eel bibimbap, mentioned by many other reviews, was rich and smoky. Yummy.Now, the yuzu ramen was definitely the weakest dish of what we ordered. It's a dry ramen (so no soup broth). Everything except the grilled shrimp was kind of bland, which was disappointing. That being said, the shrimp was grilled to perfection. All in all, a great experience. The yuzu ramen brings it down from a perfect score from me, but I'll definitely be trying this place again!"

/user_details?userid=d76xC8hF1doeBlUO3Yga6Q,K C.,"East Lyme, CT",5 star rating,"Outstanding service and delicious food.  We inhaled it too fast to post a picture but it was beautifully presented and lovingly described when they brought each dish to the table.  Many reviews mentioned pork katsu which they don't do anymore.  We also wanted shrimp tempura which they also don't do anymore.  We did get the surf&turf tempura which had scallops which were delicious. We had yakiniku hanger steak, seaweed salad, kaarage classic, omakase chirashi, tantan pork udon, ikura chawan mushi.  My 8 yo loved her kaarage (fried chicken) and asked for more of the mayo aioli for dipping.  my 12 yo liked her tantan pork noodles.  My favorites were the seaweed salad and the omakase sushi bowl. We were able to book reservations quickly and easily through yelp.  Parking was tricky but service was so amazing one of the staff actually stepped out to help us figure out the street parking. Cost was definitely pricey but we were all happy. Worth it for a treat night."

/user_details?userid=StRFR4Wk2sVogOb4ACckwQ,Courtenay B.,"Natick, MA",5 star rating,"So amazing! Authentic and delicious. I was very impressed because I have severe food allergies and the waitress was very considerate and able to recommend several dishes for me, both of which were amazing and allergy-free. I felt absolutely safe eating here (which is rare for me; nuts and eggs are hard allergens to avoid!!) and had a delicious meal that I cannot stop thinking (or talking) about. I didn't catch the waitress' name but she was so so wonderful and I am so grateful for her help!"

/user_details?userid=f1zhBpPnjLNah7bjdyL1mw,Jeffrey S.,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,Totally awesome dinner experience here for a friend's party.  We savored a smorgasbord of small and adventurous dishes and many fine sakes.  The wait staff and owner were very friendly and offered us several rounds of complimentary shots!  You can't go wrong here!
/user_details?userid=aeFgRyM-facwSvbyA0jIUw,Sienna Z.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,This place was a highlight of our trip to Montreal.  Our children were expecting more conventional sushi rolls but ate everything that was brought to us with gusto.  And I can see why.  The food was amazing.  Atmosphere was nice.  Staff friendly.  Well worth a trip.
/user_details?userid=V0NyT2fKIs7pwFDSGqyCKQ,H L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Owner/chef Hide is a tremendous host who makes all his guests feel special, and his food is wonderful. He serves best-quality sashimi. Everything is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the soft Japanese-style egg with roe, shiso and urchin--just delicious. The cocktails are terrific as well...there is one with smoky lapsang souchong that is unique and super tasty. 'Can't wait to return."
/user_details?userid=lUqLOHm2-wng42qMiam2Lw,Elizabeth Y.,"Natick, MA",5 star rating,"Fabulous food, drinks and service.  We will go back!  The oyster balls were perfect, as were the mackerel and the fried chicken appetizers.  The sesame noodles and Bibambop were also exceptional, some of the best we've ever had.  Nice saki recommendation by the capable waitress and a delicious mojito.  Thank you!"
/user_details?userid=4k23TO0xeaVRRo_ybSVjvw,Ray G.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,"I never give good reviews because I'm selfish and I don't want amazing restaurants being taken for granted of by you over sensitive ""foodies""....... ""I would have given this place 5 stars but I woke up and the moon wasn't quite right then I tripped and stubbed my small toe on my left foot, which is my better foot, then we arrived at the restaurant and my food was perfect and the experience was amazing. But like I said I never give 5 stars because I know more about food then professionally trained chefs because I watch ""hells kitchen"" and that guy taught me everything!  Anyway enough with you!  This establishment deserves 10 big juicy stars in my opinion!  1. Food - high kick worthy2. Employees- double high kick, everyone was so nice!3. Price - on point! High kick! I really really really like this restaurant! :)"

I've been to a few Japanese restaurants for ramen, this time I strayed a bit from the usual and was rewarded. Really enjoyed the dinner, do try."
/user_details?userid=71gbR3Et-jUb1cBScVuL4A,M D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, wow WOW!! We will make this place our home indeed. It is one thing when the food is authentic & amazingly tasty (for a fair price too) -- and that, it was, but when on top of that the staff is THE FRIENDLIEST and most polite, efficient and cute ever, what else can you ask for?! It was perfection!!!! People like the owner of Marusan are rare nowadays, I have an immense respect for passionate people such as your chefs and your team!! Gochisosama deshita :3 Mata, ne!!"

/user_details?userid=n2UcB9oJGOQ9VuhN6vS_dw,Laurent K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"- Cozy and smooth place. The music was great, at the perfect volume, and the lighting was beautiful. Perfect for a date. - The food was absolutely delicious. Love that they change some items of their menu every week depending on what's fresh. The yellowtail carpaccio and fried tofu were absolutely delicious and the shrimp sashimi as fresh as it could be. The chicken wings were the only disappointing plate ($7 for 2 wings could seem overly expensive, even if they are delicious).- Service was on point, with regular water refills and detailed descriptions of every plate when they got to our table. - Would go again and bring family, friends, and dates!"
/user_details?userid=m3yv3PugwLroV3apwcOXFA,Sebastien B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,They have a very good Japanese curry which is hard to find in Montreal. Authentic place. Small cute dinning room. Worth it.
/user_details?userid=SGSQrH_s48fZtrG4cqrtog,Patrick H.,"Arlington, VA",1 star rating,"This is not Japanese food. I ordered ramen noodle but I got Dry Ramen instead!!! It is soba noodle. Don't advertise ramen when you serving ""yakisoba"". Btw my wife makes way better mama noodle than your ""ramen"". Oh yeah curry is only served during lunch. Seriously. I've spent 3 years in Japan and never seen any ""Japanese"" restaurant like this. I should have known when I saw bimimbap on the memo. Don't come here if you want real Japanese food. This is better classified as Asian fusion."

The food is fantastic and the first time I went there with a date, our server gave us complementary asparagus tempura at the start of the meal and complementary shots of sake and frozen pineapple at the end. Great spot. 10/10."

/user_details?userid=2b-qN6WLt7Oe02flqVo_pQ,Bernard V.,"Brussels, Belgium",5 star rating,"Made reservations here for dinner and it was excellent. They seated the three of us in a cozy spot in the back. The food was outstanding, we had the best beef tartare I've ever tasted, as well as ramen, yaki udon and some sushi. The other dishes were great, but the tartare was some next-level stuff. The staff was great, attentive, but not hovering, and gladly answered any of our questions. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Was so excited after reading all the reviews! It's a pretty cool hip place for a quick lunch or after work 5à7 or a place to impress your date. It's definitely an Instagram or FB spot... you know... the place u post about it so you can feel you are cool or part of the ""in"" crowd. The only reason I give this place a 3 stars was the ""8 piece veggie sushi""! Go ahead and order them if u want to spent $8 (or was it $11?!) for 3 edamame beans on a small bed of rice.  I am not joking... 3 beans on a bed of rice. There were 3 slices of cucumber size smaller than my finger nails on there too. When we saw the plate arrived on our table...My friend and I looked at each other like... WTF.  But we really can't complain about it because that will make us uncool in this hipster cool spot. I actually debate with myself on whether I should make this post or not since everyone seems to LOVE this place... but... nobody should pay $8 (or was it $11?!) for 3 edamame beans. I will go back and try other dishes for sure... the noodles were great actually. Just not the veggie sushi. There.. I said it :)"
