/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this Pointe-Saint-Charles neighbourhood joint! Cool vibe and a great crew. The owner is super nice and does many things to support and add life to the community (e.g., organizing a lawn bowling tournament at a nearby park every summer - including a safe and socially distanced one in the summer of 2020).But about the food... yes, it's awesome!! I'm a huge fan of their tartares. Both beef and fish. Goes great with a beer  and their other foods are super tasty too. Whenever there's a happy hour sale on, I get their oysters. Always super good and I somehow always remember how good their ""oyster fixings are"". More so than when I go to some oyster specialty shacks!Highly recommend as a dinner, lunch, or happy hour destination!!"

It has amazing drinks and yummy food! Love the summer time oysters specials as well! Great place for a first date or to catch up with friends. It gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you want to be sure you get a table, call and make a reservation in advance. C L E A N L I N E S SThis place is very clean. The bathroom situation is awesome as it's not gendered so there is never a wait! It's great!O V E R A L L   Q U A L I T YThey changed owners recently, the famous Knox fries with Parmesan cheese and truffle is no more... But the fries are alright... As previously mentioned the drinks and oyster specials are on point. We ordered a plate of fries to share (6/10, good, but not the Knox fries we love). I got the Green Goddess salad, I usually don't go for a salad but this one seemed good! It really was, but I wish there was more cheese! Maybe bigger curls of cheese? Just more cheese in general. My partner got the Fried Pork Ribs and honestly 10/10. Those were amazing. Very different than regular ribs, but they were super yummy! Would recommend!C O S T$$~$30 per person for food and drinksW A I T   T I M E SWe went on a Saturday early dinner time. There was barely anyone there, but after an hour more people started showing up and most tables were already reserved! There was barely any wait times for us, we started off with a drink, try the Knox Gin and tonic! P A R K I N GFree parking located on the streets, but it's a busy area. L O C A T I O NOn Center Street in Point-St-Charles. Great area, lots of little cafés nearby. This place stands out as it  has a terrace on Shearer. H E L P F U L   S T A F FLiterally everyone who was working today came to our table. It was kinda nice."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Knox is great place to meet friends, have dinner or just some drinks. During the warm months you can get a table at the cute terrace or grab a window seat. All these windows are opened creating an outdoor feeling through the entire pub. The pub is frequented by people foreign to the neighbourhood, but certainly is an attractive spot for the locals to stop for a drink. Big advantage: parking around is easy peasy.  The food menu is carefully selected, delicious choices of appetizers and mains, and few specials for the day. Their french fries are to die for, enriched with parmesan, scallions, some spices, I can't resist having some. During my last visit I had the salad special with spinach, strawberries, mint, delightful combination of freshness that may help to diminish your guilt for excessive consumption of french fries. The braised short rib made my sweet heart very happy.Drinks will result in even happier times, great choice of beers and cocktails. Service is sweet and attentive. The only reason I reluctantly remove one star is because of the individual bills that were so much messed up when we were party of five that we had to wait forever to have them fixed. Knox may need to improve their POS system, but I shall continue visiting with pleasure due to all of the good mentioned above."

The wait for Milky Way was insane so we put our name down and looked for something else while we waited. There wasn't much around in terms on nightlife in that area but we were lucky when we saw Knox across the street! I really liked the ambiance of this place, especially the garage doors that open to give you some fresh air. They had a decent amount of specials and the drinks were good. The people working here were awesome! They were so friendly and gave us a lot of good recommendations to check out! Overall, Knox is an awesome place to grab a drink and hangout with friends!"
/user_details?userid=JndpB8cHO8py4bbB8uCV3w,Adrian C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"*3.5/5, based on one visit.This place clearly has a lot of good things going for it: it's situated in a developing neighborhood without much competition around, it has a very appealing street-side terrace, and they serve brunch on the weekend  (which is what I came in for). I ordered the mushroom crostini while my friend had the huevos rancheros. I didn't try any of my friend's dish, but I'll say that mine was delicious and I'd easily order it again...however, for the listing price, you get a noticeably small portion of food, and it also took quite a bit of time for me and my friend's dish to arrive at our table (the tavern was fairly busy but not *that* busy). Maybe the tavern is just ironing out the kinks with its brunch service? In any case, I'd be more than wiling to revisit Knox next time I'm in Montreal and try their other fare."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love my neighbourhood. Pointe-St-Charles offers so much to a resident in terms of location, proximity to the market, the old port, downtown, etc. However, as a neighbourhood that is developing, the main artery, Centre Street, leaves much to be desired. Over the past few years, businesses have slowly been opening, restaurant-bars included. One of the more interesting ones is Knox Taverne. A taverne on the eastern part of the street, it has developed a nice following around the neighbourhood for the atmosphere and the interesting food options it provides. As someone who wishes that local businesses thrive, I have been enough times now to write something up food wise.Knox is a simple but nice looking room that really enhances the nature of the old building that houses it. The brick walls, the exposed wood beams, the incandescent lights, the beautiful long bar - the space is warm and intimate. Windowed garage doors create the possibility of opening up the space in the summer on top of having the terrasse on the side of the building. The music is also great - tons of classic rock with some more recent hits. When I spend all night wanting to sign along, your playlist is working.Drinkwise, Knox has a nice beer and wine selection that is very reasonably priced. They also have an interesting cocktail menu - their Knox Gin and Tonic with house tonic is nicely balanced with a more floral touch.Despite its more bar-like setting, the food really steps outside of typical bar food. First off, they have fresh oysters on thursdays and fridays at a buck per before 8pm. A pretty nice deal - and the quality is there!On the appetizer side, I've had a few different options. The fish tacos with red cabbage coleslaw, tomatillo pico de gallo and chipotle mayonnaise are excellent. A hearty portion of tender flaky fish with a nice combination of heat and sweet with the pico de gallo and mayo. The Knox fries - tossed with garlic parmesan - are exactly my kind of fries. Thin with a nice crunch but still tender inside. The last side dish to note is the brussel sprouts. Yeah... brussel sprouts! Didn't expect that at a tavern did you? Sautéed with a maple sauce and served with some radish and shallots, this is a great subtle dish with a mix of earthiness and sweetness - exactly how I love to work with sprouts myself.As a main, the big favourite is the Knox Burger - served with Coca-Cola Mayo, Caramelized Onions, Fried Pickle and Old Cheddar. Other than the pickle (not a fan as I have indicated many times before), the rest of the burger is excellent. The sweetness of Coca-Cola actually comes out in the mayo. The burger is cooked to perfection and I love the use of the classic potato bun. On the other end of the main spectrum, they have a beet risotto served with a walnut pesto and parmesan shavings. No picture of that one but the bright purple of the dish may throw people off but it is an excellent dish and again, a surprising inclusion to a tavern manu but one that appears very appreciated of the patrons the times I have been there.Great atmosphere, solid alcohol options, surprisingly interesting and refined cuisine with good prices and very quick and friendly service to boot... Knox is a great addition to the neighbourhood that caters well to both ends of the spectrum that our neighbourhood encompasses. Very happy to support this PSC business and I hope that it is a sign of times to come for my hood.Cheers!"

What I can say is that is is a really nice spot and has a good atmosphere. They offer a good selection of wine and beer and have reasonably diverse menu. The thing that was a pleasant surprise was the food. I was expecting your typical style and quality tavern type food, but Knox delivered something that was a step well above. I had a trout that was well prepared and very nicely presented. All the other items ordered by my friends were very nicely presented and looked tasty. I will sure to be back."
/user_details?userid=6swvLbesBlUp_axQRwTlCw,Janel T.,"Irving, TX",3 star rating,"I adored this place when I first moved to Montréal. Great vibe, cool staff, and awesome menu, but after my recent visit I'm extremely disappointed that the good, substantial, and filling menu is gone. No more burgers, poutine, or tacos and that's sort of lame. The staff is still incredible but now you end up forking out 40-60 bucks for one drink and the smallest portion of food ever. *Sad face.* It's a great place to grab a drink after work and socialize but that's about it now. Perhaps it's because of the holiday season, maybe they are trying to lure in a more upmarketish/bousie type of clientele, or it could be some sort of rebranding but whatever it is, it's a turnoff. I hope eventually the menu will go back to what it was in the summer. And don't get it twisted, I just don't like what they've done with the menu. Everything else is wonderful."

Drinks are good, the service is friendly and the food is incredible. Probably one of the best burgers I've had. Nice diversified menu with many items to choose from, everyone enjoyed their plates! Cool patio to hangout on an afternoon and sip on cold refreshing drinks while listening to good tunes and enjoying the vibe. There are always people here, 1 visit and you'll understand why. Definitely recommend."

/user_details?userid=a_WQp4FhgfJwWh-JaNXNZg,Amanda M.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",5 star rating,Could not be happier with the service and the food at Knox Taverne. The staff is super friendly! Ask them for a delicious cocktail and they will deliver! I have been there a couple of times and was never dissapointed. The Knox burger is a must try! Seriously heaven!! People need to skip  the usual Griffintown spots and walk over the bridge to give Knox Taverne a try! Go ahead! you won't regret it :)
