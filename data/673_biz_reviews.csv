/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"I'm a big fan of this place. Took a weekender trip here and was craving some dumplings, and stumbled upon this place. The location is prime, and inside is nothing special: cash register, tables and a kitchen. But even at 3pm on a Sunday this place remained pretty packed. I ordered the XLBs and the cold peanut noodles. XLBs were really good and juicy. I think that the skin of the dumpling varied a bit in thickness, some being too thin and coming apart when picking them up. But aside from that minor critique, the taste, the size, and the juiciness of the baos were perfect. Pricing is cheap too, 10 of them for about 8 bucks. I think I would've been satisfied with just to dumplings but I also needed some noodles. They were good, nothing amazing. Great spot for a quick bite."

Most of the time I cheat and just skip the technical steps.. and times I'm hungry and pop it in to my mouth only to find myself fighting the burning hot liquid .. feels like lava flowing down... Knowing I'm not going to feel anything or taste anything for the rest of the meal.If I have to choose between eating a hot dumpling or getting brain freeze with ice cream I choose ice cream.All this to say if you haven't tried soup dumplings you're in for a treat. This is one of my favourite places it's super affordable and a great variety. It can get a bit crowded but that's what you get when the food is that good. I personally like the lamb...This is the type of meal you want to come with a group sharing a variety of dumplings makes the experience so much more enjoyable.They do have pan fried dumplings but I'm a huge fan of the steamed dumplings.. If you do want to make this a proper experience and try to make use of the spoon I found this online and some places have the instructions on the wall. If this is your first time feel free to ask them as well ..Put soy sauce and vinegar into the bowl. They say 1 part soy sauce to 3 parts vinegar would be best.i like to had hot sauce.Take the soup dumpling and dip it into the sauce.Then put the dumpling into your spoon, and poke a hole in the wrapper of the dumpling to release the juices.And finally eat."

The service was fast and efficient, always coming to fill our water. I tried the crab xiao long bao, and it did not disappoint. The skin was chewy enough, the soup was at just the right temperature and the whole thing was delicious, dipped in a little bit of vinegar, soy sauce and spicy oil.

The shrimp and coriander soup dumplings are phenomenal! I am still craving them! The shrimp, scallop and pork soup dumplings were also great, but if you can only order one, get shrimp and coriander!You can see the staff create and cook the dumplings right in front of you! So fresh! And prices are very reasonable. The portion per order is large for one person! Highly recommend!"

Although we were in a large group (10 girls here for a bachelorette), we felt like the wait time for our food was unreasonable (especially since we just ordered the same things, just in multiples to share amongst the group) and were surrounded by dirty tables that weren't being cleaned after patrons would leave.They also ran out of ice during the hot summer day and we were left to drink lukewarm water. We also ordered the a pitcher of the sangria that was advertised on a poster and they seemed to not understand how to make it, and we ended up with a weird mix of fruit juice and minimal alcohol. We had to ask for things multiple times.The soup dumplings themselves were above average. There was a good ratio of meat and dumpling dough and they came out hot. There was also vinegar, chilis, and soy sauce available on the table. We also ordered fried dumplings and those had a bit too much dough to it."

It did not disappoint. Went for lunch with my friend and we got the fried lamb and green onion and the steamed juicy pork,shrimp,scallop. This place makes the best steamed dumplings I've ever had. The fried I think I would go somewhere else because their lamb isn't very flavourful. But the steamed ones were perfect!! Next time I really want to try the juicy sweet pork ones. Seating is medium sized and my friend and I had no trouble getting a table right away and the service was very fast. She did mention they were friendlier than during the night time hours though."

This place was quite close to our hotel so we dropped by for our lunch before heading to toronto. Since we already had brunch, we ordered their specialty being their soup dumplings! We got a juicy pork and leek (classic) as well as the chicken and mushroom lunch deals making the prices extremely reasonable!  The chicken and mushroom was quite different as the texture of the mushroom gave it a little bit of a kick while the soup was less concentrated. The juicy pork was exactly that. Flavourful, juicy pork with plenty of soup that looked very flat but were actually just sogging with soup! Overall, delicious XLB for a great price!"

Ordered the Xiao Long Bao Juicy Pork (10 pieces) and the Pan Fried Cabbage and Pork dumplings (15 pieces).The Xiao Long Baos skin was a bit thicker than I was used to but was surprisingly very tasty! I do not really like when the dumpling skin is too doughy and chewy but it was a good balance. There was a lot of flavour and I enjoyed it. The pan fried dumplings very great, not greasy but nice and crisp. They were a bit on the drier side so I added some vinegar dipping and chilli sauce on the side but it was still awesome.This place is small and I felt a little squished in between two tables. I did not particularly enjoy having to shimmy between tables and I do not like when people are sticking their butts near our food when they sit down.But I did come on a weekend almost before peak dinner time so I think for next time I will come during a weekday and beat the lunch crowd. The service was good, there was a particular lady who was so sweet and she provided great service from our interactions.I really like this place especially for it's price and quantity - I will be back!!"

When I found this place (on yelp!) and saw that they had a bunch of great reviews, I was so excited! I suggested it to my boyfriend and he seemed pretty interested, so we came. We came on a thursday, but it was still pretty crowded. Luckily for us, we came fairly early, so we got a table immediately. The back of my chair was touching the chair of the person sitting behind me and it was almost impossible for people to pass between tables. We ordered the lamb and corriander as well as the traditional pork. We ate the lamb first and it was quite yummy! I was pretty happy with the flavour. However, the pork was rather bland and didn't really taste like anything. That was quite a let down.Another thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the skin kept breaking. The entire point of xiaolongbao is to have that nice broth. If the skin breaks, the broth is obviously going to run out. The staff was okay. They worked quickly, but they seemed a little hectic, which made me feel rushed. When it came time to pay, we had to go to the register, which I don't mind at all. However, because there's no real line, the customers seemed confused and there was inadvertent line cutting. The meal was fairly cheap though. 10 xiaolongbao came to 9 or 10$. Overall, I was pretty dissapointed. The skin breaking, the bland pork, the cramped space and feeling rushed made my entire dining experience less than great. However, I will proably go back at some point to try it out again to see if I get a better experience."

With a hole in the wall type atmosphere, but the food and dumplings were next level delicious!!This place was very close to our hotel so we dropped by for an early dinner - Please do not come here if you're pressed for time. Everything seemed to take a long time to come out, I was bothered by the wait for our food until I realized everything was being made fresh in the back. They even have a viewing glass to watch the dumplings being handmade in the kitchen, its fun to witness the creation of these things from start to finish. he wait is well worth itSurprisingly, the peanut butter dumpling appetizer, was amazing! And the noodle peanut salad appetizer, was amazing!! _ highly recommend the both of them, and they seem to be popular with the locals -- rightfully so.Their Juicy Dumplings were so delicious, Second best beef and onion juicy dumplings were the best I have ever had, the first were in NYC. The meat was delicious and the mouthful of soup was seasoned perfectly and very flavorful - WARNING: the first bites are dangerously hot, so be careful you don't want to make the mistake of burning your tongue and ruining the whole meal with an eager first bite, especially after such a long wait. The place is great -- wish the service was a little faster and they had everything the offer on the menu - however what we did taste was delicious. It's small inside but it works because its clean and the food was so good, the wait was well worth it."

/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"So I've eaten here at Sammi Soupe dumpling a couple of times the last few months and here's my lowdown. Order the cucumber dish as an appetizer. It's freaking amazing. Like eating sweet Chinese style pickles which are crunchy and are in a sweet chilli style sauce. They are crunchy tasty delicious. Also tell mom you had your veggies for the meal! Then you can fill your tummy with XLB. Xiao long bao (Shanghai style soupe dumplings) rules supreme here. They are a pretty good value and loads of selection. The first time I ordered the shrimp pork and scallop.  It was a mistake as these ones were smaller. Then I ordered the #1 pork classic ones on the menu just this evening. The pork or beef ones are more generous in size and are juicy and freshly made in the glass cube window. I'd recommend avoiding the XLB's with seafood in them as they are just smaller portions. Also we had tried a plate of chicken fried dumplings. They were piping hot, crunchy and generous in size. Let them cool down or risk burning that roof of your mouth. Overall not the best dumplings I've sampled, however for the price they are more than adequate. Free wifi code available.  NO credit card sign clearly marked at cash register. Cash or Interac only. Pints of beer are available as well as Chinese beer if this is to your game plan for the evening. Overall the XLB is a 3.75/5- you would have to go to Toronto or Din Tai Fung for better ones but these are some of the better ones in MTL. The place is by no means glamorous. It's cavernous and loud when the restaurant is full of hungry young student crowd. The tables could be described as somewhat closer together also.If you can stomach the basic decor and loud place the XLB is worth the visit!"

I stayed at a hotel a few blocks away from Sammi and decided to drop by to pick up some food. An order of pork soup dumplings and small wonton soup took them 20+ minutes to churn out. This is after I told the cashier I was pressed for time too. If I haven't done so, the order would've taken closer to half an hour.Food - OK I guess. Soup dumplings were soupy, but there wasn't much depth to the flavor. The skin was not too thin, not too thick so kudos to that. Wonton soup is nothing to rave about - plain and bland, but edible. The killer is the SAUCE that comes with it. It's a premixed blend of hot chili oil + vinegar, but tasted like canola oil. No spiciness, no acidic vinegar. Weird much."

The beef and onion is also another favourite of mine. And yes, it's on the sweeter side and that's just a trademark of Southern Chinese cuisine (so don't go there if you're craving spicy food). Note.

All were so amazing and we ate them within minutes! All were extremely flavorful, I would very strongly recommend ordering the pan fried dumplings with beef curry as they were especially delicious. The atmosphere was scattered as there were so many people. it took about five minutes to be seated at the peak of dinner rush and the server was incredibly attentive and polite.

I have been going there now for more than 10 times because it is really worth it.Located near Concordia University in downtown Montreal, this place serves very affordable dumplings. As a consequence, it can get very crowded both at lunchtime and dinnertime. I mostly go there during lunch time because the prices are slightly lower (7$ for 10 dumplings vs 9$ for 10 dumplings).The service at this place can get pretty bad sometimes, being understaffed at most times (eg. one waiter while the restaurant is packed). It might not be the greatest idea if you are in a rush. But the food does compensate for the not-so-great service. One other thing to keep in mind too, once you make your order already, it might take up to 15 minutes before your food arrives. Food-wise, I feel like this is as good xiaolongbao you can get in Montreal, especially for the price. Their variety is decent also, which includes different choices of meat (lamb, pork, shrimp). Overall, poor service, but very good value meal!"

We got the lamb and coriander, and sweet pork soup dumplings, and the beef curry pan fried dumplings.Soup dumplings are what you'd expect: juicy, thin skinned, and flavourful. The lamb did not have a gamey flavour and tasted delicious. Sweet pork was my favourite though! The fried dumplings were just a bit smaller than I expected.We went at 6pm on a Sunday night, but the fried buns and the majority of the pan fried dumplings were all sold out! Just settled with what's left on the menu. Service a bit slow, but you know, busy night so I'm not complaining.Prices are amazing too!

My favourite has to be the pork and coriander steamed soup dumplings, and the beef and onion. Depending on which dumpling you get, the beef and pork are always more juicy and flavourful, and have a good amount of soup inside, while others like the leek, egg and shrimp dumplings are less juicy. This place tends to get packed during the weekend, especially in the evening, fair warning. The wait time isn't the fastest but not the slowest either, taking about 20-25mins for the food to arrive, considering they make your dumplings by hand and then steam or fry them."

Sometimes the dumplings are perfect and sometimes the dough seems off and the xiao long bao are already broken when they get to me (which is sad because I love the soup inside!)You can see the dumplings being made fresh in the kitchen though. Now I've always been for dinner but according to the menu it seems it would be more worth it to come for lunch to get more dumplings for your buck.

As usual, we ordered pork/coriander and lamb/coriander dumplings. The pork ones came first and were delicious. The lamb dumplings came 5-10 minutes later. We each ate one, and stared at each other.- Is this lamb?- I think its pork.We flagged the waiter, and told him there might have been a mistake. He brought the dumplings back to the kitchen, where a few staff members sampled them. He came back and said it was definitely lamb, but would prepare us another portion (no extra fee). I apologized, but was puzzled - lamb has such a unique taste, how did I miss it? Anyhow, the second serving came, and we happily started eating. The first dumpling was distinctively lamb, and so was the second. But the third and fourth tasted just like pork. The fifth was lamb again. Was I losing my sense of taste? Did they make a mistake again? Who knows, but I wasn't very happy about it.I still think their food is good, but I don't really feel like going back anymore.Note: They brought in new tables.

After looking at the menu, we were pleasantly surprise on the pricing... super affordable! Range between 6-8$ per dumplings orders (you get 10 steamed or 15 fried). We got carried away and ordered 35 dumplings (some we took away) plus a cold peanut noodle entree. The steamed dumplings were really good, moist with lots of soup inside. We had the beef curry fried dumplings, which is an interesting mix of flavor. We definitely recommend this place, come early as it tends to fill up quick."

The place : infested with fruit flies, we couldn't keep em off us and for some twilight zone reason, we seemed to be the only ones bothered by them. It's outdated and was sliding off my seat (banquettes) broken stuffed with a rag perhaps in the hopes of keeping it together? The staff : the ones I interacted with at least, not very alive, walking around like zombies, mind you I do love Halloween but not in that context. The food : although prepared by order was not in the least bit fresh. The curry beef filling was extremely dry and tasted off. The porc gave me nausea and im pretty sure it wasn't fully cooked !!! ( you can kill ppl like that ) I ate one soup dumpling and one porc fried one and one beef curry one and I was done. I felt so sick afterwards. I don't know how this place attracts that many people and if they're too drunk or oblivious to what is really going on but I am never stepping foot there again."

We made the mistake of ordering the pickled cucumbers (slimy and underwhelming), and the hot and sour soup (chicken egg drop soup, with some fungus); normally, this would kill their chances, but the soup dumplings were hot, fresh and fast. They have thin skins and are full of soup, and full of meat too! The fried ones are a little underwhelming, but if they are your jam, then they aren't bad (just not as good as the steamed ones). The flavours they are actually come through, so shrimp and pork, you can actually taste the shrimp and pork. Alcohol is cheap and cold, so that's just an added bonus! Service is fast and turnaround is quick, so don't worry too much about the ever present line."

I guess you can never have too many dumplings right? Well, Mon and I met up for an early Monday night dinner. The weather was spitting rain outside so it was nice to take comfort inside. The place is pretty compact but it's cool how you can see the workers making the dumplings fresh in the kitchen. You can bring a bag of dumplings home (30 pieces for $10.35 - 15.00). The menu is split into three: appetizers and soups, XLB's and pan fried dumplings. I love me some XLB's but I've never seen so many varieties for it. I'm a traditionalist though so when it comes down to it, always go with the classic.- Cold noodles with peanut sauce ($2.99) - the noodles were passable but the flavour was pretty lacklustre. I wasn't a huge fan of the peanut sauce, which tasted watered down.- Juicy pork (classic) (J1) ($6.99) - 10 XLB's for only $7! Are you kidding me??? What a steal. These were a satisfying take on the classic soup dumpling. Juicy, a pleasantly thin wrapper and balance of flavours. - Pork, leek and shrimp (F4) ($8.99) - they were already out of most of their pan fried options but we were still able to try one type. These were on the small side and I wished they'd been crisped longer. That being said, they were still tasty and you do get 15 pieces. Another solid spot in the ever expanding options of Chinatown 2. Love this area. 3.5 stars."

It's pretty hard to find GREAT soup dumplings in Montréal, so I was pretty excited. Overall, my experience was okay, but not amazing.There was a sign that said ""Please wait to be seated"", but when my girlfriend and I entered the restaurant, we were told to sit wherever we wanted.We ordered their lamb, and classic pork soup dumplings. They arrived pretty quickly, which was nice. The classic pork was a little underwhelming, but the lamb dumplings were very flavorful. Although the flavor was there, I was disappointed that both types of dumplings kept breaking. I've had many soup dumplings before, and this is something that does not happen with well-made soup dumplings.I am slightly sensitive to msg, so when the food is prepared with lots of it, my tongue becomes numb. After about 20 minutes, my tongue started to feel numb; if you're sensitive to msg, perhaps this is not the best restaurant for you! This being said, the lamb dumplings were very flavorful, with lots of meat and soup. Their beer prices are pretty decent, so I may come back for some Sapporo and lamb dumplings!"

Sweet and Pork don't usually appear in the same sentence."" But my friend who frequents this restaurant highly recommended it. And I'm so glad she did. It was not the dessert sweet that I imagined, but more of a meaty sweet that complimented the flavor really well. Besides the sweet pork soup dumplings we also ordered the pork & cilantro, and pork & shrimp. And lamb & cilantro potstickers, whose wrappers were a little dry and tough. Since we don't have soup dumplings in Halifax I savoured every bite of this. Are they the highest quality soup dumplings I've had? Nope, but for $6.99/steamer(lunch price), I can't complain. They were surprisingly filling too. They're made to order so there's about a 10-15 minute wait., and the restaurant fills up quickly.

I went on a Sunday night at around 5:30-6 pm and it was already pretty crowded (mind you it is a small establishment). Service was slow as the waiters did not notice my friend and I were ready to order but we got our food pretty quickly. I notice there weren't as many options as other soup dumpling restaurants I've been (i.e., 10-15 steamed dumplings options and fewer fried options), but I still enjoyed the ones I got: fried lamb with green onion, steamed pork with leek, and steamed chicken and mushroom. The dumplings didn't have as much juice as I've experienced in the past, but I don't mind that as it was less messy. For 35 dumplings, I paid about $16 which is a good price. It's loud in there, the decor itself is nothing special, and the tables are quite close to one another, but it's the kind of place that people come and go. My general impression is that if someone I knew wanted to go there, I'd go, but for the lack of variety, I would go somewhere else for soup dumplings. I give it a 3.5/5!"

The menu is simple - a few starters and a moderate variety of xiaolongbao and potsticker dumplings. There is good variety for all diets-various meat and veggie options are available. Having been looking for more Chinese food in Montreal, I was not disappointed. The wait for food to arrive after order was a by longer than expected, but may be due to a busy night in the shop in general. Have patience as there's limited staff in the small shop. The xiaolongbao comes in sets of 10 and are more northerner sized-about 2in in diameter. Coming from Toronto where super-southern-style (read: Guangdong) ones are popular, these felt much larger and the skin was thicker. We ordered the classic pork and the chicken and mushroom - the classic was an expected good flavour and the chicken and mushroom was a good unconventional option. The potsticker dumplings come in sets of 15 and are, oppositely, smaller than I expected. They're folded with the ends open to allow the oil to leak out making the skin crispier. We ordered the pork and bok choy and the beef curry. The pork and bok choy was again, a classic combination with a flavour that met expectation. The beef curry was a surprising twist that I thoroughly enjoyed - not too spicy but had a curry kick."

This place is up on top with the best of the best, and I have not experience any place that can complete with this place, whether be Montreal or the GTA.The Dumplings are little chubby nuggets that is bursting with juice and meat. What sets these dumplings apart from the rest is definitely the wrappers and had a nice chewiness to them; not too thick and just delicate and sturdy enough to contain all that mouthwatering goodness. Served with a dash of vinegar and chili oil just for that added kick. I love the classic pork, the lamb and coriander, the pork and crab, and the juicy pork with shrimps and scallops. I love this place. Prices impressively affordable, and quality exceeds expectations. I love that diners get a direct view into their dumpling making kitchen. We get to see the staff so expertly wrap each and every dumplings fresh. It was a nice satisfaction to watch the beginning to the time our dumplings were served to us.

They did bring us a new plate, but they still were less than desirable. The soupe dumplings themselves were quite enjoyable. I guess when it's the only place in the city then it has to do - not bad. We were constantly waiting with empty water glasses which never got filled until we asked. Listen, I realize this isn't a Michelin starred restaurant, but filling patrons' water glasses, no matter what level establishment you're running, should very basic and something that just happens. Things took a turn for the worst when we went to pay. First off, no concession was made, at all, for the raw dumplings we were served. No discount, no apology - nothing! When we asked about it our gentleman server replied, ""but we brought you a new dish!"" He continued saying ""no one here can make decisions on discounts and voids so if you want to leave your number someone can call you to discuss a discount."" We didn't bother as if nothing was going to be done now then they just didn't care to rectify the situation. Once we walked out of the restaurant the server, to our surprise, followed us and said ""so would you like to leave your number so someone can call?"" We replied ""no it's fine - if you won't do anything now then that's all we need to know."" He continued by telling us ""that we MUST pay a better tip!"" This was extremely appalling behaviour. They served us raw pork which someone in our party got sick from. We sat and waited with empty beverage glasses all night. When trying to defend ourselves he looked at my girlfriend and her friend and disgustingly and rudely told us to leave.

The service was pretty darn unfriendly, but the food was excellent. Chinese dumpling chefs handcraft your dumplings behind an open glass-windowed kitchen. I got the classic pork dumplings and the flavors were spot on. The pork had a nice texture, unctuous broth teeming with porky goodness. There was just enough balance in the meat blend of aromatics to nicely compliment the fattiness of the pork. All around a very good deal for 6 (or 8?) dumplings. I'd definitely advise you check this place out for the dumplings."

/user_details?userid=XqWiDEMPFDZcbF4exyre8A,Banana M.,"Seattle, WA",1 star rating,"I have been to this place 5-6 times now. I am from Shanghai and I have to say this is the first place I have found in Montreal that serves decent xiao long bao (little dragon soup dumplings), which comes close to the authentic ones you get in Shanghai. HOWEVER, the service is amongst the worst I have experienced, even for Chinese restaurant standards. Last time I was here, I ordered the jellyfish, seasoned cucumber, xiao long bao and the Shanghai fried bun (Sheng Jian Bao).When we sat down at our table, it took about 20 mins before we got our water and here is the ""best"" part, the water we go was actually the water that our neighbouring table had. I watched one of the waitress bring the water to the next table, leave, then get called back because the table next to us wanted room temperature water. I then watched the waitress pick those cups of water, turn around and place those same cups of water on our table. She then walks away as if nothing happened. I was completely shocked. Even if a place is popular and cheap and has good xiao long bao, this should never be done. It is unsanitary.If you think this is bad, then just wait and keep reading.The cucumber we ordered were fully mushy, and it tasted fermented. I know that these cucumbers are soaked chili oil for flavour, but I don't think they should taste carbonated and mushy as if they were made last week and left out all week.The jellyfish was decent, but a bit on the salty side.The xiao long bao were pretty good, but tasted less soup filled than usual and less hot.  I feared after that they were not steamed long enough, but thankfully, the pork looked cooked and I did not get sick after.The best (or worst) part was the Shanghai fried bun. I watched the cook place it in the frier and I also watched him take it out.  I then heard him comment to the waitress in Chinese that these Shanghai fried buns were not like the usual batches he makes.  I watched him leave it on the counter for about 10min, before the waitress decide to serve it to us anyways. The cook was right, it did look a bit odd. I opened one up and of course, I could see raw pork and uncooked dough.  At this point in time, I called the waitress over and pointed out that the Shanghai fried bun was still raw inside.  Instead of apologizing, she instead gave me a dirty look when I asked if I can have a new pair of chopsticks.  The waitress took the buns and walked to the front, where she pokes around into the bun and confirm with the cook in Chinese that the pork was indeed raw.At this point in time, any other restaurant would have at least ask me if I would like a new batch made and apologized for any in conveniences. I understand, stuff like this happen even in the best restaurants and its ok if it only happens once or twice and they handle the situation properly.  But at this place, instead of of making a new batch, they took the half open Shanghai fried buns that was on our table, stick them back into the frier and then return them to our table.  I was completely shocked and very upset.  First of all, they have ruined the Shanghai fried bun, which is also a specialty dish from Shanghai. Secondly, it is just unacceptable for them to behave in such a manner to customers and also handle food like this.I had a hard time deciding which star rating to give this place...For the xiao long bao alone, I would give this place a 4 star rating, but for eveything else, they deserve  a 1 star rating at the most and I hope for the customer's sake, they improve their food safety. I hope that no ones has to go home with gastro...I am still undecided if I want to go back to this place. If you do go, watch what you are getting carefully."

/user_details?userid=qe_Yiq-Gm60TA9cK0VfbiA,Nina N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"One of the newest dumpling joints in the city, following the trend of the numerous Mandarin Chinese cuisine restaurants hat opened in the past years. Sammi, just like Qinghua and its successors, boasts about its soup dumpling, or xiaolongbao (小笼包), hailing from the city of Shanghai, in southern China. Whereas Qinghua's own soup dumplings are also very rich in broth, they are folded in a Northern Chinese fashion, while Sammi's are pleated like it is in Shanghai. I ordered the pork xiaolongbao and the pork panfried dumplings, and even though my expectations weren't that high, I wasn't entirely satisfied by the execution of the food.A bit bigger than expected and their skin being much thicker and starchier than I'm used to, the xiaolongbao were served fresh and piping hot in a bamboo basket. For newbies, the store owners were kind enough to leave a how-to pamplet at each table to help them mix the dipping sauce and eat the dumplings. The broth was satisfyingly dripping after the first bite, rich and savoury. The meat filling was salted to meet expectations and it complemented the taste of the dough. However, I find the saltiness a bit too overwhelming for this type of dumpling, especially since they're dipped in a mixture of black vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil.The panfried dumplings are a total letdown: the meat was unexpectedly really salty and the dough was too chewy for comfortable eating. The extra oil added to the dumplings during the frying step was dampening the dough, stealing away its usual crispiness. Usually, dumplings are let to drip before being served, but since it was during lunch rush hour I guess this step could've been skipped.Sammi might not deliver the best xiaolongbao I ever had, but it's one of the only two places I know in the city that offer proper xiaolongbao, made according to the Shanghai fashion. I will come back whenever I feel nostalgic about the Pearl of the Orient, but otherwise the other regular dumplings aren't worth the detour."

So texture of the wrapping is very thin indeed, but lacks the chewey texture traditional ones had.  Not that it's a bad thing.. it kept the meats inside extremely juicey, soup gushing out and hot as anyone needs it to be. Apps.. I had spicy tofu and wontons. . Meh. . Stick with the soupy dumplings.. you can't go wrong"

/user_details?userid=lDSTPdZu7fdrHdZEnVKsQQ,Emely P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This 5 star review is based on the soup dumplings only.  If like me, you've been desperately searching for the elusive xiao long bao and been fooled by places like qing hua that falsely advertise soup dumplings, go to Sammi & Soupe!  They are the best I've found in Montreal - fresh, made to order, and you have the option of choosing different meats and stuffings.  I ordered the pork/coriander and chicken/mushroom.  Both were so soupy and delicious.  I also ordered the wonton soup and spicy pickled cucumber which were just so-so.  There were a couple cucumber pieces that were old and mushy and inedible - this seemed to be a problem for other reviewers as well.  2 stars for the place itself as it was a bit dingy which is nothing new when it comes to restaurants like this, but the menus and tables were sticky and smelled weird.  The service was also a bit slow as well, but it's worth it for the dumplings in my opinion.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying other soup dumpling flavors and the fried dumplings."

I mean, why would I when they are most well known for their soup dumplings. I've tried many of the flavours but my favourite are the pork shrimp and scallop ( I think) ones."
/user_details?userid=B9hG8-Qo5Nen9GwwiywFKA,Sarah V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is probably the best place for soup dumplings in Montreal! Anytime I introduce someone to Sammi & Soup Dumpling, I create a new addict. The menu is simple and not over the top, the prices are absolutely affordable, and the dumplings are alway fresh. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because one time, the dumplings tasted a little bit like hand lotion, and since they are hand rolled, it's possible one of the employees put on some lotion before making the dumplings. It was a little off putting, but this has only ever happened once. Despite this, I have constantly returned for soup dumplings. P.S. prepare for a wait if heading here on a Friday or Saturday night. Usually the line is out of the door, but it is well worth the wait!"

It's awesome that juicy steamed xiao long bao is stuffed with pork！When you have a bite, you will be surprised there are a lot of soup inside. It's worth to try it！"

/user_details?userid=kwWfvdUg-YzYa2rc2ECnhg,Angela P.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"We ordered the hot and sour cucumber, spicy tofu, classic xiao long bao, pork and crab xiao long bao, and the beef curry fried dumplings. All the food was very tasty. The skin on the dumplings was not too thick, which is hard to find, and the soupy goodness inside the dumpling was delicious. The only drawback was the non existent service. We had to ask for dumpling sauce that was on all the other tables, and never got a refill of water or our other beverages. So go for the food, but don't expect good service."
/user_details?userid=x64CBrDNGDAMBsurKyQKjQ,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am a fan of the place. I think it's a great place to have decent soup dumpling at a reasonable price. I personally like the pork dumplings (All of them) steam and the beef curry (Fried one). The service is quick but something they mess up specially when it's busy. So try to go before busy hours, you will get a much better service.The place only takes cash and debit. Also I do not recommend the wonton soup as entree it's below average."

Beware if you're bringing people who don't know how to use chopsticks, it can be tricky since there are no other utensils besides a spoon. We brought my boyfriend's parents, and it was hilarious to see my father in-law use chopsticks! The dumplings are freshly made and well priced. I've been three different times and I'll definitely be back."

It is one of those restaurant that you won't probably go to unless you lived in the neighborhood. Looks like any random Chinese restaurant but I was very impressed by the quality of their dumplings. There were made fresh and had enough soup/filling in them. We ordered the cucumber salad and tofu and they were both delicious. If you are looking for a low key, cheap dinner, this is a great place"
/user_details?userid=UAUI3l-duD9Gb66-NENgDw,Larry D.,"Westbury, NY",4 star rating,I recently relocated to upstate New York. I always get soup dumplings when I'm in NYC. Outside of Shanghai NYC is the best place for soup dumplings. However I'm closer to Montreal than the city now. I Googled soup dumplings and Montreal and up popped Sammis. Sammi's has authentic soup dumplings. Not the best I've had but right up there. Excellent dumplings no doubt. Service was great. Waitresses were very friendly. Prices were very reasonable! Will definitely repeat!

The wait for the dumplings take quite a while (15-20 mins) because they make it as you order. Worth it! No credit, cash or debit only."

/user_details?userid=mjPzPxEc_z5TqjKvBAP6oA,Lady D.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",3 star rating,The xiao long bao was a bit too large and doughy for my taste. I enjoyed the spicy cucumbers but would like a bit more spice. We also had the fried dumplings which were good. Overall I thought it was okay but I have had a lot better.

Not the most ""upscale"" looking place but the perfect comfort food for a student like me. The service is pretty good but the best thing on the menu is the sweet pork soup dumpling.

Left with the impression that the servers just wanted to get home early, and I would be a nuisance in that plan. C'mon! Laaaaame! Such a bummer to be turned away as a customer. Once? Annoying, but I'll get over it. Twice? I've made a point of not going there again. Too bad; I love dumplings!"

/user_details?userid=MfHMubpAFrKDsigNHs01KA,Tema N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious juicy home made xiao long bao. Sweet Pork are my favorites. Fried dumplings are excellent too. Note that you can also see the ladies make the dumplings through the window :)
/user_details?userid=qTOX5PRnj-ajHt9N67E9Vw,Janis H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Why does this place keep getting such rave reviews?It's filthy, they don't use proper food handling at all. Even if the food is good, it's hardly worth food poisoning.The lamb and coriander dumplings were WAY too greasy and they fell completely apart. The shrimp and vegetable ones were okay but half had some extra mystery meat. Was not impressed, will not be returning, and mystified as to why so many people are so impressed.Service was slow and not particularly good. Ordered an appetizer that never came so we just figured they forgot it. We went to pay and they said ""Oh, you didn't get your appetizer"". We declined, paid, and left.Very disappointing experience."
/user_details?userid=UBOU6sbd96GHE_kzrBraBg,Plateaumaman J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Happy to discover this third Qing Hua dumpling house that serves delicious soup dumplings. The fried dumplings seemed a little dull after the excitement of trying not to burst the others. Picked up some frozen dumplings as well which appear to be the juicy kind sold at the Lincoln St. location. Inexpensive and fun.
/user_details?userid=KkFqE8P23Ohe5GFJHpOGmQ,Genevieve M.,"Dorval, Canada",1 star rating,"By far the worst service you can possibly get. Ive had their dumplings multiple times and that's why I keep coming back to them, but after tonight, never again and I would never recommend it to anyone I know. Waitstaff lacks initiative, and there is an apparent weakness in their management team. We got our table at 5:32pm and by 6:04pm our orders had still not been taken, no one had the decency to even tell us it wouldn't be too long and that they'd take our orders in a short while-absolutely nothing. Our waitress found it more important to refill everyone's cup of water in the restaurant as well as refilling the extra cups on the counter for the upcoming customers rather than taking our order. Having worked in a restaurant, I can say that I am quite understanding when I see the waitstaff swamped with customers but the service I received tonight, I must say was horrendous and I will make sure to tell everyone I know of my displeasure of this restaurant."

And you get to watch them being made from scratch by the hands of the staff; then proudly put before you to slurp and enjoy.And the price is also great : $7.95 for 15!!Equally enticing is the option of ordering and then hanging about for 10 minutes to take home and boil up a simple and delicious meal!!"

They make the dumplings by hand, for a reasonable price, and they are truly sublime. I tried the spicy tofu appetizer and was not impresse, as it was a block of uncooked soft tofu, cut into cubes and covered with raw scallions and fiery red chili oil and paste. Not my cup of tea, though others may enjoy it. They also sometimes have hot tea available and other times they don't, which I find a bit odd. Point it, the dumplings are incredible. Go and eat, you will not be dissapointed."
