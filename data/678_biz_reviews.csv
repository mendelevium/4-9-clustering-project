When i first arrived here in Montreal i tried a lot of places. The service, the food and the easiness of the staff was so warm and welcoming. I know that these are hard times but i strongly recommend supporting them in any way you can. The owner and ever server(i hate that word) was fantastic!  Warning...their poutein is addictive!!!!"

The maple and sriracha sauce was the perfect amount of sweet and with a bit of spicy to top it off with the crispy delicious fried chicken. The fried chicken was so tender and easy to cut, the meat fell off perfectly. Extremely impressed and will come back again!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This is My 3rd time at Bird Bar, and the first two times, I enjoyed the place immensely. We always say third is  a charm; sadly in this case, my third time is a displease. I went for brunch. Service is amiable, and with the help of our waitress, I ordered the vegan drumsticks with maple siracha sauce. The drumsticks were disgusting, taste like broth. I enjoyed my sauce in that dish with jalapeños bread. Then I had truffle mac n cheese, which I had it previously during my both visits, personally, it was the best dish ever. But now, I don't know if the ingredients have changed, or cooking style have changed but it was a major disappointment. The pasta was over cooked, but the liquid inside was not properly absorbed. The dish was very fluidly with over the top flavors of truffle. For sure, there won't be a fourth at bird bar. :("
/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"Situated on Notre Dame street, this restaurant's specialty is, you guessed it, fried chicken.The ambiance of the restaurant feels very relaxed and lounge-ish type; I don't know what I expected it to be but but to me the name made it sound more like a hipster restaurant. I ordered their fried chicken with a water melon salad and we shared a Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was delicious; creamy and cheesy, not too salty and not too liquidy.The fried chicken decent. You have a fair amount of sauce choice to go with it. I had their maple and sriracha sauce. Pretty good I have to say. The chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had better fried chicken but it wasn't that bad. The price was pretty fair considering.The waitress was very friendly.Overall, decent food, good experience."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to this spot located in swanky Griffintown a few times including dinner, drinks and lastly brunch, and can say that I've never been disappointed. The sleek modern design and beautiful bar, make for a great place for an evening out, and the place is always buzzing. My only thing about the specie is if you're seated at the tables, the space is crammed! You're basically sharing tables, that's how close you are, and scooting in and out of your seat can be a challenge. My last visit here was on a weekend for brunch, and haven eaten here before, I can say that the food is good overall but their small plates are far better than the mains; the mac n' cheese balls, wagyu pogos, and the jalapeño corn bread with honey butter are yum. However there's one thing on their main menu that stood out and that's the fried chicken! From two pieces to a whole bucket, the fried chicken is perfectly moist on the inside, crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned every time. Pair it with any of their 14 sauces, and you're set. Knowing this, I tried their chicken and waffles for brunch. Wow! Chicken was perfect, the waffles were great, and the maple sriracha took the dish to a different level. The service is always courteous although when it's super busy, it can be slow but I would definitely be back for some more of that chicken!"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Tried two of their chicken topped poutines recently. Note: were picked-up so this review is not about their decor, however the gentleman I spoke to to coordinate the order pickup time was quite good to deal with remotely. I will say; they packaged the order nicely with the brown poutine sauce on the side. Unfortunately, they had to be reheated a touch so they probably lost a bit of the freshness factor. Here are a few other notes...BirdBar Poutine; Pretty straight up. Ok semi sweet, semi thick, semi crispy fries. On top: Fried chicken nuggets, sliced jalapenos, chopped chives, light colored (blobby not squeaky) cheese and a pretty plain brown sauce. Overall not the best I've ever had, but a decent bite.  Karaage Poutine; Pretty unique taste combo. Fries same as above. On top: A more flavorful Karaage chicken (however the batter looked like a tongue with thrush; pale and crumbly), sliced spring onion, cilantro sprigs helped with the balance, and the sweet chili sauce was good too. Overall, the highlight of the two and a 'respectable' poutine combo. The portions were on the larger side, and were enough to feed two, plus several of handfuls of fries to a friend, and leftovers eaten by another. Adding to about 3.5 portions out of two orders = shareable."
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,Such a cute place!! Had brunch on the terrasse on a Sunday. Surprisingly it was pretty empty which was fine by me. Had to try their waffle and chicken with sriracha of course and it did not disappoint. The chicken was sooo tender and the breading wasn't too thick. You only get to choose the sauce if you're only getting the fried chicken though; I wish they'd give the choice with the chicken and waffle too. The service was ok and the price was a little expensive. I also wish they had more of their dinner options during brunch; they look so good as well! Hope I would have the chance to come back for dinner.
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here to celebrate my birthday, and this place did not disappoint! The resto had a great vibe to it: DJ with great music, great looking bar, good food and great staff. We were seated at the bar, which honestly was spacious and had a great view of the place. With recommendations from our waitress/bartender, we started off with cocktails, the Rococo was very refreshing and tasty which reminds me of an upgraded mojito. As for food, their plates came in quite generous portions which are great to share. Their truffle Mac N Cheese was very tasty, well seasoned and cheesy. As for their famous fried chicken, they were so crispy and tasty on the outside and juicy on the inside - delicious and simple. But with their sauces, it completely elevated the chicken, especially their jerk mayo which is a slightly spicy Caribbean tasting mayo and their bourbon sweet bbq dip. I also tried my friends' beef short rib, which was so delicious - rich in flavour, falls off the bone and melts in your mouth! To my surprise, since it was a birthday celebration, the owner kindly treated me and all of my friends with free shots - which was very nice of them! Overall, I highly recommend this place, especially for events! With a great ambiance, great quality and tasty food and drinks for a decent price, served by a great staff - what more can you ask? I'm definitely coming back, and hopefully get to check out their bar the Hen Den. Also, I recommend making reservations here because the place is usually packed."
/user_details?userid=Mmoh4ODMOYgQyR03nah4Nw,Claudia R.,"Titusville, Hopewell Township, NJ",5 star rating,"Hands down one of the best dinner spots in Griffintown. Great aesthetic, great music, very friendly bartenders, and i can't even describe the food. I ordered the burger and it was without a doubt the best f*cking burger I have ever had in my life. Chicken was so crispy but so so sooooo delicious. Every ingredient worked together in the best way possible. I almost cried of happiness while eating the burger. I would give up my first born child for that burger."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Was disappointed with this place. Unfortunate given my genuine yearning for a high quality fried chicken option near my home (Griffintown). While I find their selection of dipping sauces incredibly varied and quite inventive, the chicken itself disappoints. It was under-seasoned and the skin was too crispy. Of course, this may be idiosyncratic to me. The chicken meat was a bit inconsistent: some pieces were dryer, others moister - quite surprising actually. Maybe they're going for the ""a little something for everyone along the moisture target spectrum"". Or - more likely - their quality control is suspect. It's too bad.Overall, I feel this place has invested in a lot of window-dressing (nice decor, attention grabbing sauces) while neglecting the real foundation of their joint: the quality of their fried chicken. One mental benchmark I use in assessing a place like this: would I prefer eating KFC on my roof deck instead? The answer in this case is - unfortunately - yes. (Despite the fact that I prefer moist to dry chicken meat in my fried chicken).My view: if proximity isn't relevant, go to Dinette Triple Crown for your fried chicken fix in Montreal."

The place is quite nice, I like the setting and the ambience very much. There are more than meets the eyes if you just ask the staff ;) Service was excellent, our waitresses were very nice and helpful.My friend is a vegetarian and was really excited to try the mock chicken and I must admit that it was the best non-chicken chicken I've tasted, even compared to some real chicken!We had the sauté brussel sprouts with mini turnips (had them skip the bacon), the Tuscan kale salad with mozza and crumbled croutons; the melon, feta and mint and finally the popcorn mock chicken. I really liked everything though I would skip the melon salad next time as it wasn't as flavorful as I expected (I suspect the lack of taste in the melon is due to the weaird weather we've all been having but the feta, I don't know, maybe they could get something with juuuuuuust a bit more salt?)The coctails were delicious as well, totally rounded off our great meal. I'd definitely come back"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One year later I've returned to a place that my review was ""Meh"". This time it was for brunch which I wasn't aware they served. The waitress was friendly and accommodating. We sat in a cozy corner and started with a shot of espresso. I loved the descriptions they had for every dish. I ordered what they called "" Not so boring brunch"" which actually describes my personality. Lol. Eggs, bacon, sausages and waffles served with toast and a kabab of fruits. How delish is that! The service was a tad slow but our waitress made up by surprising us with a brownie served with melted marshmallow  and cream. That was just orgasmic! Did I say how accommodating they are. Finished with another cup of Joe  and a smile on my face. A thumbs up for Brunch ..."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place. Our waitress was extremely friendly and engaging. We ordered a bottle of proseco which at 70$ was about 25$ overpriced. The waitress explained that their ""concept"" was fried chicken and bubbles (champagne or sparkling wine). No kidding, given they need to cover their rent on this popular block of Notre Dame.Onto the food: -Oysters with popcorn chicken on top: The oysters are cartoonishly small, yet they are charging the same prices as Liverpool House or Lucille's . The piece of popcorn chicken was rendered immediately soggy when placed on top of an oyster. This concept needs to be reworked.-Fried green tomatoes with panko and cheese: This was delicious and well executed.-Fried chicken and waffles: The fried coating on the chicken has ABSOLUTELY no seasoning or taste. This is unforgivable. Imagine you're in the mood for some good comfort/junk food. The plate presentation is spectacular and you dig in only to realize that eating this chicken is more of a chore than a treat!The lack of seasoning is easily masked by the sauce served with the dish, but the chicken should stand out on its own. My wife and I for the most part ended up discarding the crust and just eating the chicken with the waffles. The waffles themselves were spectacular as was the maple sriracha sauce. We also tried the jalapeño cornbread which was very good. Perhaps we would return to try something different, but they did name the place Bird Bar so I have my doubts."
/user_details?userid=eGS3dz8J7WyraODNAIXdvA,Simon M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"*****5 stars out of 5*****My cousin recommended to the Bird Bar.  I always like comfort food, especially fried chicken.  It was one of the best fried chicken I ever had.  We ordered the classic chicken and waffle and the pulled pork poutine.  The chicken and waffles comes with a watermelon mint feta salad which is very refreshing and complements very well with meal.  Our waitress, Ellen, was very polite and gave recommendations to our order.  Even though we didn't order any drinks, from time to time, she would come to the table and pour the water bottle when our glasses are half empty.  This is what I call attentive service.  Will definitely come back again and try the Mac and cheese!"

Conveniently located in Griffin town- the restaurant was hard to identify - but the crowd inside quickly got my attention.I went as one without a reservation- the manager was very accommodating. Although, I would definitely recommend making reservations a head of time. Decor was cutting edge and wait time was short.I ordered their signature ""orange you glad it's not a Julep"" cocktail ($12) - a combination of a bourbon mint and watermelon, presentation reminded me of a Moscow mule more so. For my starter- i ordered the 3 oysters will popcorn chicken ($11) - to my surprise it was an amazing combination of elements to play around with your taste buds! My main course- chicken and waffles ($28) - this was so good!! Portion wise it is perfect for two. Service was friendly! Good for a business gathering or date night!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Super fun place in Griffentown.  Trendy decor and upscale comfort food on the menu.  Have been twice now as part of a big group and had the group tasting menu both times.  It's good value and you get to try a lot of the things on the menu.  You will definitely not leave hungry if you take this option.  The appetizers included a fancy version of a pogo, Mac and cheese balls, and oysters.  The apps were just ok for me, a bit bland.  Next to come out were several different salads which were all amazing.  There was a kale salad, Brussel sprouts, and a beet salad.  I could have finished all of them off and called it a night there.  But then the tower of fried chicken arrives, with biscuits and pickles and various sauces.  I'm not a fried chicken fan in general, but damn these are good.  The sauces were kind of underwhelming but honestly the chicken is so good, don't even bother.  Decent cocktail menu and wine selection.  Service is friendly and attentive.  The manager passed by our table more than once to make sure we were happy.One important point - this place is LOUD.  Both times we where there on a weekend around 8-10, it might be quieter on weekdays, I don't know.  There's a DJ in the room playing some seriously kick ass tunes.  It's a super fun lively vibe, but you will have to yell at the person sitting next to you to have a conversation.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but this ain't the place for an intimate quiet evening, that's all.  In summary, skip the apps, go for the salads and the chicken, put on your party shoes and have a great time!"
/user_details?userid=LzUm_7NoJBkv_y7ywjwOlw,Eunice I.,"Quincy, MA",3 star rating,"I appreciated the decor and ambiance in here. What confused me is that when my friends and I arrived we were seated in the front and asked to sit in the back booths since no one else was there. We were told it was reserved for a dinner party which was happening in two hours. We clearly would have been done before then, but alas, minus a star. The second drawback was with the food. Since it is a place that specializes in chicken I was surprisingly underwhelmed. The chicken skin was very dry and it lacked seasoning and possibly they don't use the most flavorful cooking oil to fry the chicken. If I didn't dislike wasting food, I probably wouldn't have finished the dish. I will say that the service is impeccable. Everyone there was very nice. The truffle mac and cheese was also worth noting!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"After hearing so much about Bird Bar via social media, we finally decided to go despite the mixed reviews. We made reservations on a Thursday night and were seated right away upon arrival. The restaurant itself is super cute and nicely decorated with a buzzing ambience and even a live DJ. We looked at the menu and ordered the Get in ma belly fried chicken with maple sriracha and bourbon sauces as well as the brisket stuffed burger with sweet potato fries. It took forever for the meal to arrive and when it did, the presentation was amazing which made us really look forward to digging in. Unfortunately, the meal fell pretty flat. The chicken was just ok. Super crispy but not really flavored at all. The jalapeño biscuit that came with it was delicious. The maple sriracha sauce was a big no-no but the bourbon sauce was excellent. The dish also came with a watermelon and feta salad (something I love) but this was probably the biggest disappointment of the night. The watermelon was so tasteless it felt like I was eating feta with water. Really disappointing. The brisket stuffed burger also fell completely flat despite how delicious it looked both on the menu and on the plate. Sweet potato fries were fine but nothing special.Although the service was good, the temperature in the restaurant was insane (and this is coming from someone who can handle heat like it's nobody's business). There was barely any A/C on despite 30C weather outside so that definitely didn't help.All in all, it was $66 tax and tip included but not really worth it to be honest. We left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Won't be back..."

Was there with a large group of coworkers on a weeknight and we were impressed by the decor. Tried the mac n cheese balls & popcorn chicken appetizers, which were the worst and best dishes of the night, respectively. The popcorn chicken is spicy and sweet - a perfect combination. Got the 3-piece fried chicken plate with cornbread and 2 sauces (sriracha maple and honey Dijon). Yummy. Overall, a good experience and would go back but not the best fried chicken I've tried in MTL."
/user_details?userid=dSi-ENQZNeLKr-mfXoD1mA,Ignatius C.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm writing this review 2 months after having gone, so my memory might be a bit blurry on a few things. However, i clearly remember how I feel about the restaurant, and what I thought.Stepping into the restaurant, the host wasn't present at his place. No line up, seats available, but we remained polite and still waited about 5 minutes before the host came to see us. No apologies as to why he had abandoned ship, just came to talk to us as if nothing happened. To be honest, he wasn't very welcoming; just getting the job done. We later figure that he was probably the owner, seeing that he was trying to micro manage everything and everyone, from controlling the music volume to adjusting light levels, garnishing dishes like an expo should, giving the bar a hand, etc. Observing the rest of the staff, they didn't seem to be on very happy terms with him. Anyway, I'm not gona criticize too much on how a captain should run sail his ship and lead his crew.Our waiter was charming and very polite, although it took a while for him to taking our order. It would seem that they were understaffed that night perhaps. The food itself took a while to come out (a little over 30 minutes), but hey, if they take that long, maybe it's prepared really well? With lots of love, perhaps.We had the Tomato Squarred, Brown butter-Tarragon mushrooms, and the Elephant ear. The tomato squarred was really fresh, it was up to expectation, but it did not exceed them. It's the kind of recipe that many restaurants can/have done before. 4/5 for the taste, 3.5/5 for the presentationBrown butter-tarragon mushrooms were pretty tasty too, juicy on the inside, and well grilled on the outside. Personally, 12$ seemed a bit steep to me, but hey it's an experience. 4/5 taste, 2/5 presentation.The elephant ear as the main course, the main event of the meal. I mean, the chicken was tender and well fried, it was a notch up from your neighborhood KFC. Presentation was less than impressive, i did not expect an arugula forest on top of my chicken. From far it just looks like a dome of arugula. I'm not sure how we're supposed to eat it, but you definitely can't reach (or see) the chicken until you've had a few bites of arugula first. 3/5 taste, 1/5 presentation.Overall the decor of the place is nice and modern, the bar is full marble and it's very unique. Lighting ranges from family oriented to loungy to romantic because it kept changing (lol).I know they pride in using free-range well-fed local chicken, and it kinda shows in the way that the chicken is tender. However, because most (if not all) of their chicken is fried, it masks the quality difference. It feels like someone with money built a nice little place, and found a way to make KFC expensive yet desirable.Would I recommend it the place? Nah. Would I go back? Nah. Is it a bad place? Nah. Is it a good place then? Meh."

/user_details?userid=UirqnjnmN1CLusITMx7Dhw,Dyson L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A pretentious little place that serves fried chicken. The said chicken is a hit and miss -- you need the sauce to eat these. Truly good fried chicken should be tasty even without sauce. But the food is just a side-show. This place caters to a precise type of clientele: people that look trendy and/or look wealthy. There are lots of pizzazz, like live DJ (you get the idea), trying to justify the price they ask for those fried chicken. It's the same idea as the ""luxury"" burger joints or those places that adds truffle to a perfectly fine traditional dish and call it a high-end new idea. The name is fitting: a bar for human-birds to flaunt their (often fake) colors and feathers while chewing on the real, but not particularly interesting, version of the animal. People truly interested in good fried chicken should look elsewhere."

Okay, let's get to the good stuff, the food!We started off with a pop corn chicken appetizer, wow this things were hot! Nice and spicy, with a tai sauce drizzled over those delectable chicken pieces. The chicken was good, just a tat chewy, but still delicious. Then we ordered truffle Mac and cheese, and a 3 piece chicken plate..... the chicken is definitely the star here, nice crunchy coating, and the chicken is fall apart tender, wow one of the best friend chicken I ever had, besides triple crown, they are still king in my eyes. The Mac and cheese was a generous portion, very creamy and I think it was also gratine. Someone at our table took the brisket and another the chicken and waffles that came with bourbon sauce, it was mind blowing, this sauce made the dish come together! I would definitely come back, the warm setting along with the delicious food. Would make any night memorable! Hmm"
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have long heard about the nice brunch of the Bird Bar over the weekend, but was surprised that there weren't that many people there after all. I am not a big fan of fried chicken so I didn't try the seemingly very famous fried chicken because I find it too greasy for my taste. Instead I tried their shakshuka dish with eggs and toast, there's also a beautiful rainbow like fruit brochette next to the poêle that they serve. I have to say that the presentation was very on point, but not so much for the taste. I went to the Sparrow on Plateau last week and tried their amazing shakshuka, which motivated me to take it again at the Bird Bar, but I was disappointed. The service was quite slow as well, but the waiter was quite nice and polite. Maybe their fried chicken is out of the world but that I wouldn't know, the interior decor of the restaurant is nice too, so I would still recommend you to try this place out after all!"
/user_details?userid=v0VWFNdYpIywMDea1DOq-w,Gaby P.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,Probably the best fried chicken I've had in montreal.Chicken n waffles were delicious & the maple siraccha sauce was to die for.Mac & cheese balls were also good.Only downside to this spot is that the terrace is extremely tight.
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"Bird bar is a new restaurant on notre dame that specializes in fried chicken. I went with a group of friends on a Sunday night and was impressed with how busy the place was the whole time we were there. The location is great and the decor inside was nice and chic , which was surprising because given that their specialty is fried chicken I was expecting a much more casual ambience. Our server was friendly and checked on us often and we did not have to wait very long for our food even though it was busy that night. The prices were very reasonable and the portion size was perfect. I ordered one of their signature cocktails called le coq royale and it was delicious light and refreshing. For my meal I had the braised beef brisket with dirty mash , onion confit and roasted veggies, and I have to say it really hit the spot ! The meat was tender and tasty and the mash and vegetables were also very good . Other people at the table also had the fried chicken and waffles , salad and truffled mac and cheese. They were generous with the chicken portion and while everyone enjoyed the chicken they did mention that there was some room for improvement. The sauces they had to accompany the chicken really made a difference though everyone really enjoyed those. The truffled Mac and cheese was also very tasty and creamy and the truffle flavour wasn't overpowering. Their dessert was also solid , while a bit pricey the portion was generous. We shared the cheesecake which was good but not great it lacked a little extra something and our friends ordered the banana cake which was by far the better option , not too sweet, great flavours and definitely original. There was some issue with the lights dimming up and down at some points but they're so new I think they were having some technical issues. They're still very new so it's normal they have some little improvements to make but we did have a good experience and would to back again !"

The fried chicken is very good! Not like any other fried chicken I have ever had. They also have an amazing spicy maple syrup that really complements. While the food was very good, we did need to ask for our bill three times before we got it, and the restaurant wasn't very busy at that time. However, what's really great about this restaurant was when we asked if there was any peanuts in our food, the server said, I don't know, let me check, and he ran to the kitchen and came back with a very definitive, no peanuts!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"When it comes to fried chicken in Montreal, we are definitely a long ways away from needed to get KFC for a fix. Many restaurants around Montreal offer wonderful fried chicken on their menus and now, we have a full-on fried chicken bar in the Bird Bar. Located on Notre-Dame Ouest on that killer restaurant road, the Bird Bar comes from the mind of  Kimberly Lallouz of Miss Prêt à Manger and Monsieur. It is a fried chicken and champagne bar that also houses a 'hidden' bar in the basement called Henden.I am always game for some fried goodness so a old McGill teammate of mine and I decided to use it as a catch-up place and see what they had to offer. The space is certainly a looker - very elegant and modern. The bar is heavy on marble, the seats are covered in black velour and the focus in the room goes to the beautiful rainbow-shaped light fixture. Not really my style but I can recognize the beauty of it.The menu is a mixture of southern comfort food upscaled and some other items. As a starter, we went for some fresh shucked oysters with popcorn chicken and jalapeño mignonette. Loved the presentation and the oysters were beautiful - fresh and salty. Honestly though, we both felt the popcorn chicken overtop to be unnecessary. The chicken was nice and juicy with some crunch and the mignonette brought some kick but it came to overpower the naturally wonderful taste of oysters. We would rather have had the chicken on the side and go back and forth than have the two combined automatically.With the fried chicken to come, we order a few sides to enjoy as well. First was a feta-watermelon-mint salad. Nice looking salad, very fresh but it felt disjointed. The individual items didn't blend together well so it came off flat to us truthfully. Our other side was some french fries. Very generous portion and exactly the kind of fries that I love - a bit bigger than matchsticks, tender but with a nice crunch. But fundamentally, the big attraction here is the fried chicken. Made to order, the chicken is sourced from Ferme des Voyageurs and is free-range, local and vegetable grain fed. On top of that, Bird Bar boasts to have implemented a system that drastically reduces the grease absorption of their fried food. All of that gives us chicken that is very tender and juicy on the inside and has a very thin and crunchy coating. Despite all those positives, it just didn't work for me. The coating felt almost too crunchy and in a way the lack of that grease absorption took away some flavour and made it lack any pop flavour wise. The sauces that you can get with the chicken felt much more necessary than they should have. We went with maple siracusa and bourbon - very flavourful in both cases - but I don't believe they should be relied upon that much. This chicken certainly didn't match up for me compared to my favorites in town which was certainly disappointing.For dessert, I tried the banana chocolate cake with salted caramel. The cake was nice and dense with great flavour and the caramel was sweet and decadent. An excellent finish to the night.I came out of Bird Bar feeling disappointed. Nothing was bad food-wise but nothing really wowed. For a place that markets itself as a fried chicken place, I didn't think the chicken was all that amazing. Perhaps it is just not my type of preparation but I believe there are better options in the city at a better price point as well. I can see Bird Bar as a nice happy hour or cocktail but I don't honestly see myself coming back for dinner. Notre Dame street is a tough place for new restaurants right now. Fried chicken may convince people to come over but whether that novelty works long-term remains to be seen in their case.Cheers!"

We went for amazing drinks and fried chicken I think what really makes it is the amazing truffle gravy sauce that comes with the biscuit and the the fried chicken. An other thing I highly recommend is the kale salad it's really really good! The wine selection is smart and the cocktails solid!
/user_details?userid=ibixRU62K5BjQGwNFgVgRA,Michele M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The Bird Bar is a a very beautiful place with great drinks and great decor but that's pretty much it, don't go there expecting to eat the greatest friend chicken of all time cause you won't (unless you have never travelled or gone to the southern USA) the chicken is ok. I  ordered a side of Rapinis and that was just ok as well. The only reason I gave this place a 3 star is because the drinks and atmosphere was good. Music is way too loud though."

/user_details?userid=uHCyl1v-RkYegE_AsH2rog,Liliane V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This review is strictly on their fried chicken and waffles. Maybe my standards for this dish are exceptionally high as I've had some of the greatest chicken n waffles from Roscoe's (in LA) to Amy Ruth's (in Harlem). The chicken was over-breaded, and not in that loving way because it was practically crumbling off the meat. Inconsistent seasoning and some parts were not evenly crispy, just hard. Their 'honey butter' sauce was poured all over the waffles so by the time I got to the second piece, it lost its fluffiness. 3 stars based off cool atmosphere; would be willing to return to try other things as the menu seemed pretty diverse, or at least for cocktails. Will update later!"
/user_details?userid=hiEj-3X8gV4-kBNkySOSJw,Diana L.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,Very crowded even on a Wednesday night. The service was slow and the food was okay. I've had better fried chicken at other places. The shrimp plate was not bad. It has a very nice ambiance tho!

We sat at the bar and only had apps. DJ was great, but music was a little loud. Good service. The manger checked on us a few times and comped and round of drink in their exclusive downstairs bar. Would definitely visit again."
/user_details?userid=izcnVx6WSOVu9LC-aOi71w,Pauline D.,"Weston, FL",4 star rating,"I loved the fried chicken.  It was moist and not greasy. Also super hot .  I was disappointed with the Poutine, which we ended up sending back because it was cold.  The chicken and waffle was very good but the waffle itself wasn't a crisp on the outside fluffy on the inside( it's what i associate waffles with) but it was still very good.  The watermelon feta salad that the serve it with really ""lightens"" the meal.  The kale salad is great. It was perfectly seasoned n dressed.  We had the apple crumble for dessert.... yummy!!!! The place is really nice, the music wasn't too loud, and the wait staff were always around to check on us."

It's a great bar to take a date or to go with a group of friends. The music is loud and clubby. We felt a bit under dressed lol . The lights kept going on and off which was kind of random. I think it's because some of their light bulbs weren't working. The food was good. It wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had though. It was a bit dry but it came with two sauces. I picked the spicy mayo and sweet chili sauce. Both sauces were good and I would alternate between the two. The sweet chili sauce wasn't very spicy. It tasted like sweet soya sauce. I ordered a side of fries and they were crunchy and salty. I also ordered a side of green salad. There was s bit too much dressing on it. The chicken came wit pickles and jalapeno cornbread. The cornbread was dry as well. My favorite thing was the truffled mac and cheese and the dessert. For dessert we had the banana bread with whipped cream and salted caramel. I'm not a big fan of dessert but I would have ate it all myself if I didn't have to share it. My friend ordered the chicken waffles and they gave him so much chicken because the chef thought the chicken pieces were too small so he had more chicken than waffles! That's amazing and so nice ! The drinks were also very good. I had the Carter Defait of Diable cocktail. It's made wit tequila, smokey mezcal, lime, chili and maple syrup. My friend ordered the coq royale and I liked that drink better. It's made wit Pimm's , prosecco , lime and ginger ale and fruits. I would come back and try their small plates and their other drinks."
/user_details?userid=WgdozIRyj5St8VQ9it-j5A,Stuart A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The chicken itself was nicely cooked and had a pretty tasty batter. In isolation, the chicken would get 3-4 stars. Cornbread was delicious. The chocolate mole for dipping was completely off in texture and taste. The salad was extremely salty. Oysters with popcorn chicken on them was a surpsingly alright combo but I doubt the popcorn chicken had any chicken in it. It was just batter.All in all, nothing ruined the night, but the food wasn't great."

/user_details?userid=k6vt83kAVEhvibjf5A9_eg,Mary E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My husband and I went to bird bar one evening on a whim. It sounded great. Fried chicken!? Hell yes! When we got there it wasn't quite what I was expecting. A far far swankier crowd and atmosphere than I was expecting for a fried chicken joint. Which is fine, I love fancy interiors...which was honestly the best part of the experience. We ordered the wagu pogo, the bone marrow and the fried chicken. All of it was generally underwhelming. The marrow was OK, I've had it way better though (Manitoba is a resto that does it very well). The Pogo's were fine as well, but nothing that blew my mind or special. But the thing that disappointed me the most was the fried chicken! It was cold for one, and the batter was just very plain. Nothing exciting or different... Considering the place is supposed to specialise in fried chicken, it did not deliver. The atmosphere was swanky and cool, but the food did not live up."

Everyone loved the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was tender and juicy - we had high expectations and were not disappointed - and the service was very friendly. There was a great selection of seventies and eighties music playing, a welcome change to the usual elevator music they play in some other restaurants. Will definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=Sp42UYEuooAF8xTesa86Dg,Justin A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went for lunch with a few coworkers and we were all a bit conflicted about our experience. The decor is beautiful and the menu is spot on however the food is a bit underwhelming considering the price point. Compared to similarly priced lunch options (eg. Grinder, Foie Gwas) the food just didn't hold up. Additionally, our food came out extremely slowly - it took over an hour from the time we ordered. That's not awesome when you need to get back to work. I think if they refined their food and offered a lunch menu at a more friendly price point that they could execute in a timely manner they would be successful. As of now, I don't think I would recommend this place."
