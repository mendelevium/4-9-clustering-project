/user_details?userid=WMjtBdZqbUIa4pnnrQJ4WA,Anzor A.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"It is good to be back writing reviews...a NO for me btw.The place is located in Montreal Downtown and it is very confusing if its open or not. That removes one star.The food choices are very limited, but it I like the vegetarian concept. The food quality was very disappointing to me when I saw veggies and others were dried and oxidized. I guess the owners need to take care of this, as non of the condiments were closed with a lid. Secondly, the only one employee that made my wrap just smashed it with a combination of tasteless items. Another thing that made me think that this place deserves one star is that the guy broke the pita and made a mess. I would never come back because I have never eaten such a dry and tasteless food. Montreal food is disappointing."

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cheerful place with clean and bright colors.The service is fast, and falafels are fresh. Their menu is concise and clear, and everything is very tempting! I have a soft spot for the ""Melty"" falafel, a cheese-filled bundle of joy. I also tried them wrapped in pita, which was nice. The flavors really come through, which makes it worthwhile to try the different falafels. During lunchtime on weekdays, both Vua and Falafel Avenue get huge lineups, with Falafel Avenue being slightly less crowded!"
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I cam here from Israel so I can say with 100% certainty that I know my Falafel and in Montreal this is as good as it gets. In order for a Falafel to be good it needs to be FRESH, made on the spot for the costumer and not sit and dry in a bowl. Here they make Traditional style and newer style (that in the middle east started 10-15 years ago) where you make green or red(spicy) style Falafel balls. They also have a nice cheese filed version. What I loved here is the ""Big Fa"" a which is like a pizza made from Falafel and Pitta extreamly good and you can usually find it in Turkey and the pocket pita (whihc is a normal pita in the middle east) and of course there multiple versions of Thini (sesame) sauce. Its not the best Falafel I had but it is the best one I had in Montreal. Go try it"
/user_details?userid=Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It took me just one opportunity to realize how i love falafels. And this place is definitely responsible for that. Crunchy outside and moist inside. Falafel avenue is more like a fast service... to go... style... place. I just could not find the right words to define it. They have 4 different falafels and for me the MUST TRY ones are: the fondant (with cheese inside) and the vert. On top of that... you can try a pizza, witch is a pita bread, falafel dough spread, grilled and topped with... well... cheese and veggies. Oh... if you like potatoes... they have a delicious fries... Anyway... anything you order will feel like you had a full meal."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing place, worth the stop for vegans or meatlovers on a break, i understand they cannot stay open till very late but we sometimes get cravings for it late night, our first stop, after their opening was very disappointing, but management took care of it in a fair way! Very happy and satisfied since our second visit !"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Working downtown I always welcome an alternative to the usual food court fare.  Falafel Avenue's focus is on falafel as you might have guessed from the name and is an excellent option if you are in the McGill area.  Prices are reasonable and the food is great.There are a variety of falafels and they bake them which makes them healthier.  You choose the ones you want and you can also choose between having them in a classic pita, sandwich, etc.  You can also get a trio which includes a drink and choice of either fries, salad or dessert.  My only complaint is that they were out of what I originally wanted and it was only the beginning of the lunch rush.  I still ended up enjoying my classic pita falafel  but they need to plan for busy periods a little better.  Also the fries are pretty delicious. The owner is very welcoming and even during a lunch rush he tried to make conversation with his customers.  Prices are very reasonable especially by downtown standards.  My lunch cost me less than $10 and the quality was certainly quite high for fast food."

The best falafel wrap I've ever eaten, and the fries were just as good. The employee that took our order was very nice and friendly and genuinely cared if we liked the food. Great place to eat in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So HAPPY to finally have found a fully vegetarian falafel restaurant. My husband and I have been in love with the Maoz chain restaurants, and were sad that there was nothing comparable in Quebec. But this place is absolutely amazing. They are so kind, welcoming and will tailor your food to your taste. We have been 5 times already and cannot praise it enough. We are so thankful for another great veg restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=aVxpgZk6ZwUBKzvCs2Ae4w,Jacqueline N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"My favorite I-have-time-to-kill-and-am-moderately-hungry place! I seriously come here so much, I am guessing I am three purchases away from getting recognized by the staff. Always clean, friendly service, amazing prices! I always get the Big Fa with sunny falafel and spicy tahini and add onions! Delicious!!"
/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow! Best spot next to where I work. Vegan, clean, nice service and not expansive at all. I come back here all the time!"
/user_details?userid=qXCge-66wwcxbgmRevxRJg,Caroline P.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Falafel avenue the best falafel in Montreal they are crunchy from the outside and tasty in the inside. Ingredients are super fresh and the staff are super welcoming
/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is honestly quite special, I personally don't know any other falafel places with such variety in falafel flavor and sauce in Montreal. Everything I've tried tasted really good, I especially like their cheese falafel and the VG sauce. I prefer their classic wrap over the pizza or the 'big fa' since they use falafel spread instead of the actual falafels so you lose a lot of the texture. The portion isn't huge, but it's cheap and you get what you paid for. Their fries are also really good when it's fresh, try them during busy hours. We made the mistake of going at like 3pm and getting stale ones, which they shouldn't sell to begin with but oh well."
/user_details?userid=88UG99StS5MRnx4SCaoXVA,Keziah D.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,was I was strolling and came across this place. First time having falafel and it was a very delicious. When telling them I was good and free they told me what I canning cannot have and we're very helpful. Definitely will be coming back before I leave Montreal
/user_details?userid=BxOG479iEleffbKoR_X3Mg,Tania P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As of today, best falafel joint in Montreal. Mind you, I admit to not having tried every falafel places in town, but I have tried many. Growing up with an Egyptian mother, I have a decent background on how they should taste. Average size place to sit and eat and the staff is very friendly and efficient. You can't really ask for more when it comes to a place that serves a quick meal, particularly for lunch. The place offers a few different flavors or falafels and tahini dressing/sauce."
/user_details?userid=-964saQt27G-tBJ_8-vhPA,David C.,"Winchester, MA",5 star rating,"This is a nice option for delicious food made with love in Montreal.  I spoke with one of the owners, who is kind and helpful, and respect what he and his brother have done.  While sitting over lunch I enjoyed the energy and the clearly passionate clientele lined up out the door.There are four falafel options and five tahini choices, offered in pita, ""Big Fa"", SF pizza, croquettes, and salad.  What will surprise many is that everything offered is made in the store and is nearly vegan (except for the cheese)."

/user_details?userid=zDX5MJHh1CmyP8tYAI0Tlg,Daniel B.,"Perth, Australia",5 star rating,"Delicious, fresh and warm - with a friendly proprietor and very fair prices. Try their Big Fa for a cool new twist on the traditional falafel - baked rather than fried.  Mmm."
