When I went today it was still closed since we are still during the Covid shutdown of restaurants (so sad by the way) for restaurants and for foodies such has us! Please reopen them fast!Anyways, I was happy that it was open on a sunday night and that there was many clients. I will come back many times and can't wait for them to reopen."

/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Covid ordering: Order online and after 20 mins, your order is waiting for you in a contactless paper bag. I wasn't sure which salad to order and one of the reviewers suggested the Wolfe with balsamic vinaigrette and goat cheese. It was NOT a good combo. I then tried the Wolfe with the regular vinaigrette that it comes with and it was much better (although I still didn't love it because the parmesan is too strong). My husband's go to salad is the Wolfe with no adjustments (the fresh parmesan doesn't bother him so depends on your preference)But, my favorite salad here is the Endless Summer. I requested no pomegranate seeds or sesame seeds as I don't like too many seeds in my salad but I'm sure it's fine either way. The tempura onions really make this salad tasty. However.. the tamari mock chicken was gross. I picked it out (I'll opt for that to be excluded next time )I also like the harvest salad although I could have gone without all those cranberries."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My wife (the cardiac rehab nurse) waited several weeks to exact her revenge for my last poutine outing, dragging me kicking and screaming to a salad place for lunch. My expectations were low, even after entering a very nice looking, if somewhat overly feminine, dining space. The salad menu is huge and it took me several minutes to narrow my choice down to a Mexican salad with grilled chicken. Sigh, at least Brit & Chips is around the corner if this doesn't go well...Hmm, the salad was excellent! Lots of fresh ingredients and a clearly homemade and tasty vinaigrette. The salad was dressed perfectly with just the right amount of dressing, I honestly can't imagine getting a better salad experience. Fellow Yelpers, you know I'm not much of a salad eater, but in the interest of karmic balance I will try to eat one for every trip I make to the poutine place. And if I must eat salad, it will be at Mandy's."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent Mandy's location! Lots of seating in a gorgeous environment. We came around lunch and were pleased to see that there was no line. I ordered off the mvp menu (the spicy tuna salad 20.99). We sat and quickly received our meals. Service was quick and friendly. The salad is huge and was super fresh. A bit light on the dressing but I prefer that than overly dressed salads because you can always ask for more! It's expensive but high quality and perfect for the salad mood. Yum!

I went there to pick up  lunch for me and some coworkers but as soon as I got in I regretted we had to come back because the place is ADORABLE. I also love that they have a mini store section where you can wonder around while you wait for your food. The menu is amazing if you want to get something healthy but sttill creative and tasty. Their cookies are also really good! If you work around this area do yourself a favour and take your lunch break at this Mandy's. It's such a relaxing spot with all the plants and big space!The service is also really good, all the staff was super friendly and we all left thinking we should definnitely come back for an actual lunch at the place!"

This place is all about the details... if you're big on a fun feminine ambiance than you will enjoy the look of Mandy's old port location. I ordered the Endless Summer salad, portion was huge and ingredients were fresh. I loved my salad so much that I purchased a copy of the Mandy's cookbook before I left so that I am able to recreate this healthy delicious meal at home!"

There is a cherry blossom tree in the middle of the restaurant where you can take cute photos with your friends and your food. There is also a station where you can serve yourself some water.

Located in the heart of old port and very spacious which makes it very practical for lunch. The menu is extensive so there is a variety of items to pick from. I ordered a customized salad which really good!  I also shared their cookie, truffle and brownie which was absolutely delicious!The service was wonderful and I will definitely be back. In the summer there is also a patio. If you're a local or visiting you must visit this location, you will thank me :-)Ps: congrats Mandy and Rebecca!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The Mexican bowl had some grit in it either due to spinach leaves or cilantro.  Otherwise, the salad was very fresh, satisfying and tasty.  I managed about half of it as I was at a work lunch but couldn't deal with the sand.  So after my lunch guest left, I went back to the counter to explain the situation. They were more than happy to give me a credit to a free bowl of salad. So I went back the same week and claimed my free bowl.  They were so cool to offer me any choice of salad bowl and recommended the most expensive salads, the QAISER SALAD ($18.99),  even though I only had the humble Mexican bowl ($12.99).  I've had the QAISER SALAD another time after that on my own dime because it's about as hearty as vegetarian salads can get!  I love the savory mock Shish Taouk chicken. For that reason and that the salads are legit tasty, I'm a fan :)"

The moment I walked into Mandy's, a lovely human greeted me and asked me if I'd been before and even showed me the menu, answered my questions, and recommended some salads for me. In the front of the store they sell salad dressings and loads of beverages and snack foods. LA CROIX FANS REJOICE: THEY SELL LA CROIX HERE I ordered the Mexi Salad with mock chicken. I believe it is mushroom based, or at least that's what my amateur veg taste buds told me. It was delicious!! They bring it to you and while you wait you are surrounded by cute table decor and a stunning view of old montreal. The salad was huge! I was super grateful for that because I'm the kind of girl who does not settle for small salads. #bigsalads #seinfeld I had a lovely experience and will definitely be back to try other salads. I was so impressed by the environment and friendliness of staff. It helped that the food was yummy as well! The holy trinity of a good restaurant experience! Also, I swear I don't usually do this, but I took a picture in the bathroom stall, because EVEN THE BATHROOMS ARE CUTE, DAMMIT!"
/user_details?userid=rY_NNP8KiSNQt1OXtznm4g,Ashley G.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing place to check out if you love eating salads with a gold fork in a chic & fun environment. If your looking for a cool Instagram photo, this is the place to come. I think everyone (including myself) had their phones out taking photos of their meals & the store itself. Its just too cute!I ordered ""the fave"" and the hubby had the lumberjack salad. While mine was light and tasty, I preferred his garlic-y dressing to my lime vinaigrette. Ordering can be a tad slow at the cash if you get stuck behind the wrong people, but once ordering, service is pretty quick, and we must have had our salads at least 5 minutes after ordering our meals. Will be back next time that I am in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=4GgTdBChcHgvwGjwkW5ycg,David G.,"Lexington, KY",4 star rating,"Had the family in here for dinner. Super fresh ingredients and interesting, original choices. I ordered the Seoul Bowl, which was very tasty and original. I really liked the sauce that came with it. It took a good taste and took it over the top. I'd highly recommend.My wife had the Mexican salad, which I'd also recommend. The romaine lettuce in this dish was very tasty, and I liked the cilantro/cumin vinaigrette dressing that came with it.The kids shared the lumberjack salad. To me, this one was seriously lacking in flavor. There just wasn't anything there that differentiates it from any other chain restaurant's salad. The Caesar dressing didn't do much for it, and it simply lacked a lot of flavor.But, overall, we had a great experience in a very pleasant environment. Additionally, the employees were very helpful and present. I'd go back."

They are known for great juices and salads. The system is great, order at the cash and get a seat number. Sit and wait for ur meal :) the wait time was good and what makes this perfect is u don't wait for ur bill. Just leave when ur done! I like the decor and layout.I ordered the Superfood Salad served with a house dressing. The house dressing is amazing and the salad is packed with flavour. It's one of the more filling salads on the menu.. well as filling as salad can be ;) I had a lunch meeting there and apparently I wasn't the only one. So it's a great spot for a one one one business or friendly meeting. Defiantly going back..."

It reminded me a lot of a breakfast at Tiffany's kind of feel. I felt underdressed! The  menu at first isn't obvious since it's not listed in the back. I had to ask the server who handed us a menu. There was a variety of soups and salads. The wild sage salad was so good with goat cheese, figs, sweet potatoes as some of the ingredient. The price is not cheap but totally worth it for the environment. I still can't get over the fresh flowers. Such a cute date spot!!"

It was a little far from our hotel, so I was crabby and complaining the whole walk over. We arrive, and it's an adorable place with super cute decor and a very friendly staff. I ordered rice noodles with peanut butter tempeh and Tamari sauce. Wow. Wow. And WOWWWW. It was so absolutely delicious that we're going back there RIGHT NOW. I can't get enough.My boyfriend's Lumberjack salad was gigantic and absolutely perfect!And the huge chocolate chip cookie I grabbed to save for dessert got devoured on the walk home...it was one of the best I've ever eaten.

/user_details?userid=gpVGGRqujHo694csdMVh8w,Sara G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't often go to the old port these days, but I was there last weekend with my cousin and we were looking for a light lunch. And then I remembered that Mandy's had opened a new location in the area (thanks, La Presse!). The location is kind of hidden; I think there's still some renovation on the street and the sign wasn't super visible either.Once you get inside, you're hit with the wow factor of this place. It's really beautiful and photogenic. You can tell they've put a lot of thought into it. However, the salads are also worth it, in my opinion. I had the Habibi salad ($13.25). Filling and delicious. My cousin had the Tokyo salad ($12.75) and also enjoyed hers quite a bit. Attentive service. All in all, I had a really nice time here. But do expect to pay more than any other counter restaurant that serves salads."
/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Been to this beautiful cafe twice. It's so so pretty and with the warm weather upon us, the little sidewalk set-up they have makes it even more enticing. The service is stellar and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. They give you a large helping of an endless selection salad.  Reminds me of the giant California salads that I love. You definitely leave full and happy that you made a healthy meal choice. But the dressing on the ones I've had just doesn't make the mark for me. I will return, though. Because on my last visit, I was offered a sample of their mushroom ""chicken.""  It was very tasty and you wouldn't even know it was not meat."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"Soooo cool. I don't want to be sexist but I'd say Mandy's is probably more feminine than male. I mean I would recommend it to my girl friends and maybe not so much to guys. The wifi password was UNICORN, you see? There are pretty flowers on the tables and the menu consists of countless healthy salads. I loved it all. Although... maybe the pink couch in the corner is a bit much ^^ The music is cool too and it's spacious so I felt comfortable staying much longer than I needed for finishing my soy latte a yummy choc chip cookie (which was served on a tile! Heavy but cool).I'll come again and report to you how I ate my way through the salad bowls."

I wish I had this close to home!We got the Mexican and Habibi salad & for my 5 year old I got the brown rice bowl with beans and olive oil with tofu and broccoli. Absolutely perfect! No need to add anything to enhance any flavors! Who would've thought on vacation in Montreal staying at old Port I would be able to find a healthy vegetarian friendly place where the salad is really a meal? Usually this neighborhood is full of either very good upscale restaurants or tourist traps. Thank you Mandy's!

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is their only location that serves the chicken thai salad. I am not exaggerating when I say that this might be the best salad you'll ever have. It's on the expensive side, but totally worth it. It's a very hearty salad filled with roasted chicken, cooked Ramen noodles, coconut chips, mango, mint, cilantro, green onions, peanuts and other wonderful ingredients that I am probably forgetting right now, tossed with a lime vinaigrette. Amazing. I just hope it becomes available in other locations."

I had a hard time choosing so many items sounded good, but was very pleased with my choice in the SuperFood Salad.  Also I had a kombucha, and was impressed with all the healthy beverage choices as well.. I was confused by all the candy their shop was selling retail,  when the rest of the menu Seemed to Prioritize healthy eating."
/user_details?userid=sM2nUnkubRokHGnQP0GCBw,Joanne W.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Tried this gourmet salad restaurant yesterday while visiting. Delicious options. We chose the Habibi & Santorini salads. Both were delicious although could have used a bit more watermelon in Santorini. It had few, very small chunks. My suggestion would be maybe a piece of French bread to accompany. I would have liked to try a soup but not available in summer. Prices were a bit high as many of reviews mention. Because the salads are so big, maybe a smaller size and lower price would work. I am sure there is a lot of wasted food which is never good. Could solve both issues. Overall, good place."

Or maybe I almost cried because I was hangry. Either way, it turned around a very stressful moment. We ordered the Lumberjack salad and I was speechless for a moment, that's how delicious it was. By the way, you can easily share it between two people. The salad is huge! And delicious! We got take out because we were rushing to a show but I would have loved to sit there and enjoy the meal.

My boyfriend and I popped in here one exhaustingly hot day to refuel. We were pleased to find a beautiful, welcoming interior that was very well decorated. We ordered our salads which, like others have noted, are very expensive. We spent in total $40 for 2 salads (added chicken) and no drink. I would've loved to try one of the absolutely refreshing looking lemonades or strawberry mint (I think?) but couldn't bring myself to spend that much. Also if it had been cooler I would've splurged on the bulletproof coffee - sounded amazing!Anyways, salads were great & thankfully large portions to (kinda) make up for the $$ spent.

I've been to the one in Westmount several times but this new location is amazing. The space is huge, the service is impeccable...starting with the person greeting us at the door and guiding us, the people taking our order, helping us get seated and then the clean up. They have a great selection of Mandy's merchandise as well as other great products like coffee and gourmet pretzels. The salads are a great portion size and delicious...my favorite the 'Man Salad' has now been renamed 'The Lumberjack'....I guess to make it sound even manlier. There's a line to order, but it moves really quickly as there are multiple stations to place your order and they provide you with menus in line while you wait to ensure the line goes faster. Overall, the sisters deserve a huge congrats on this new expansion."

We often love going out of our way to Mandy's as we can bring our little guy. On a hot day my first concern was to hydrate my fury friend. The manager 'Konstantinos' sees me looking around, 'is there a Dog bowl?' I ask he's directs me outside, there isn't one, I then have to ask a waitress who brings one out. He then comes to tell me that the dog water is for paying customers only. Really, what a joke. I then meet my friends and we place our order. He had plenty of time to apologize, instead I'm meet with embarrassed nervous glances from across the restaurant. Between myself and friends we easily spend around $500 a month here. Shame to be treated like this at one of my fav spots."

Amazingly friendly staff who are more than willing to help our customers with anything; they also speak fluent english so there are no language barrier problems like at other places in montreal we've gone to.

There are lots of lovely restaurants to choose from in Vieux Montreal, but as a tourist I found the green salad selections sparse. By my fourth day in the city, I'd had my fill of viennoises, smoked meat dishes and contemporary French cuisine--my body craved raw vegetables that were garden fresh. Mandy's didn't disappoint. The options are extensive and suitable for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Lovely ""shabby chic"" light-filled interior with friendly staff. Great beverage selection, and surprisingly the BEST latte that I'd had while visiting the city. (Even better than some highly recommended shops.) There are multiple locations, and I can completely see why!"

Food was incredibly tasty and wholesome. We are here for dinner and then came back the next morning for breakfast and got the loaded avocado toast. Insane and filling. So good. This place is amazing. Highly recommend!"

/user_details?userid=nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,Shin Ling L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went there for the first time last night, and it was really good! The service was fast, the waitresses were really friendly, and the atmosphere in general was really calming. I tried their Wolfe bowl and it was incredibly flavourful and full of textures, it was with a creamy dressing, arugula and some other greens, sunflower seeds, brown rice (I'm sure there were other stuff in there too but I'm just trying to make a point that there were variable textures). The bowl is HUGE, and I couldn't finish it (probably that churros I had before lol). One thing though, the flavours were amazing, but I feel like if you eat slow like me, you start getting bored of the taste (especially it was heavy and creamy like my dressing). I'm hoping at least some people relate to that, I get bored of foods halfway through a lot  I would definitely go again though, to try another salad (perhaps with a lighter sauce this time)."

The 5 stars you yelpers have bestowed upon Mandy's is truly well earned.  It doesn't take much to sour my opinion and I've got nothing but praise for this joint.  If we were staying in Montreal longer Id be a frequent flyer here because it was that good."
/user_details?userid=2ytDHnp_93XI6z0rh1Ejgg,Zach V.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,A beautiful place with exceptional food. I can honestly say one of best custom salads (options are incredible) I have ever had. All of the ingredients are extremely fresh and bursting with flavor and the people who work here are extremely friendly! An amazing experience around.

Absolutely delicious and so many choices. I would definitely go back and try a different salad the next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=a6kNDYdQx9AXhDJhHKQ2Kw,Jill E.,"Mountain View, CA",5 star rating,"This is definitely a new favorite. This is a casual dinning place with friendly staff. We went on a Tuesday night; we had called earlier to make a reservation since we were planning on seeing Cirque that night and we were told that they don't take reservations. (Their website said they did.) We got there around 6:20 pm and there was plenty of seating for the 4 of us. After we ordered our food at the register, we went to sit down and we were quickly given both flat and bubbly water for our table. The food came out pretty quickly too. I had the Salmon Sensation, my son had the December special with roasted chicken and my niece had the Mexican salad with chicken too. We all agreed the salads were tasty and not over dressed, with the right proportions of ingredients in our respective salads. Plenty of satisfying ingredients made it for a healthy, and filling meal. My husband who wasn't that hungry had a bowlful of marinated tofu, added some greens from my salad and a berry smoothie. He felt quite satisfied too. I split the Nutella smoothie with my son and  we both agreed when we got back home we would try and duplicate this delicious drink, which included, almond butter, almond milk, Nutella and a banana-all ingredients we typically have on hand.  YUMMY! I just wished we had a Mandy's in California where we live, as I could easily see trying all the salads!  Encore, encore!s is definitely a favorite."
