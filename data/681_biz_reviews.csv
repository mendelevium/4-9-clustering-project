It's in a prime location right near the Bell Center which I've walked by numerous times, but it's time to check this place out and let's see how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Once in you're greeted by the host stand and it was BUSY. Good thing I was by myself so that I could just squeeze in at the bar... but which one? I chose to go upstairs because who doesn't like eating higher up? Despite this place being called "" The Beer Market"" it was fairly elegant, which surprised me. I expect something along the lines of a sports bar, but it was quite the opposite. The lighting was dim, which added a bit of an intimate feel. So I sat upstairs at the bar but unfortunately I didn't have a view out of the big windows that looked out onto the streets.Service: Quite a few of the bartenders took care of me. They rotated and did a fairly nice job checking on me to make sure I had everything I needed. I loved the attention and feeling like I was important.Food: Obviously if you follow me you know that I'm a wing connoisseur. I just love them and I try to stay away from pastas, breads, potatoes and sandwiches due to the carbs. Oh well. Lol. So first up were the Markt Chicken Wings which were supposed to be ""cut and shaped to keep the chicken juicy and your fingers clean"". (That means all the meat was cut away from the smaller end of the drums so that you don't get your hands all dirty.) This wasn't even the case so I don't know why it's written in the menu. Lol. They came out like regular wings... drums and flats. They were spiced very well and I chose to get a spicy sauce. It was fairly decent! Next up were the Dunkel Duck Wings. They're duck drumsticks marinated that are braised in beer then fried until crispy and rubbed with spices. They're served with a golden barbecue sauce and a spicy cranberry sauce. They were delicious. You have to like duck to appreciate a duck wing, which I did. Both of my orders were totally worth getting again.Value: All prices in $CAD. The food wasn't cheap. I'll tell you that. My 15 wings were $28.00. Wildin'. The duck wings (6) were $15.00. So yeah, not cheap, but still worth it. The quality is surely in the food.In conclusion I really enjoyed myself here. Their menu has some other intriguing options that I'd love to check out someday. Give this place a shot if you're in the area seeing a concert or watching a hockey game!"
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This brewery is not messing around people. I went there a few times and I'm never disapointed! Their beer menu is awesome, there's definitely something there for everyone - and the food is just so decadent, so cheesy, so comforting it only makes this already cool and beautiful place more cozy! The place is also so cool, the dark wooden walls and furniture gives the whole place a certain elegant but cozy vibe that makes it a perfect go to place during winter! It's also huge- there's 3 floors. Don't rely on those roomy floors though thenplqce gets crowded pretty fast after 5:30pm, probably because there's so many corporate buildings around and they must be their go-to place for happy hours.I recommend getting the local beer flight! It comes with one red, one stout, one pale ale and one blond.You'd be ok with any food option but I loved their Bier, Bacon and Cheese dip you won't be disappointed!Beers are priced around 12$-15$, the loca beer fight is 12$ and the bier bacon cheese dio is 16$, for reference."
/user_details?userid=ELMsVx1eTQ4fbs3BNcfSUA,Kelly H.,"Berlin, CT",5 star rating,"It's all about the beer! The beer menu, four pages front and back, is detailed in bottle/pint serving, with bittering, color, and alcohol percent. Like a crisp new travel map before vacation, I loved it on sight and wanted to take it home. Cider, sour, pils, stout, it's all there. The food menu isn't small but looks small compared to its chronicles of beer counterpart (and that's okay since it's all about the beer!). Beer pairings beside each starter and entree was also nice to see--and ignore for another beer--but a good help to have.Both Steam Pipe and Trou du Diable Pitoune Keller pils both paired nice with chicken ABT 2.0, and Don't Worry Be Hoppy was one very fine IPA flight (Goose Island substituting Vilains Brasseurs Fleur Session, just fine) with the Markt burger. Sweet potato fries was a good sub with each handheld, and for our little one they accommodated a plain cheese pizza request (her loss skipping that smoked chicken and pesto). Friendly staff--seriously kind, despite the mixed service reviews here on Yelp--multiple washrooms, and hotel proximity, and awesome beers of course, we'd go back again."

A very convenient spot but the food is just ok and the service varies a lot depending on the waiter you get. The restaurant is very spacious. For big groups you will most likely get a table upstairs and I found it comfortable. The staff does seem to wean off because we are on the second floor though so I suppose that's why the service is bit slower. The menu is has lots of choices and things  are mid-priced. I only got the poutine entree because I wasn't too hungry. The portion was good but it was a bit expensive. Taste wise it was a basic poutine, not too basic but not too different. There was bacon and a drizzle of creme fraiche."
/user_details?userid=Uhe5eNNOrnmcvesspLnBDA,Joe J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Perfectly located on the corner with an overview of the cars and people passing by if you were lucky to get a window side table but if you didn't, well you can still enjoy the noisy ambiance. Whit a large menu to select from mainly pork-related dishes but the focus is actually on the vast collection of beers, so if you are a beer fan and want a place that can fit a large group of people then head to the bier market."

I ordered the homemade pizza chicken and pesto. Extremely mediocre pizza. The pizza crust was still white but very tough to cut. The chicken was decent but not salted enough, and the cheese was tasteless.Someone in our group got the steak and it was the absolute worst piece of meat I've ever tasted. The steak was chewy and tasted like burnt. Would not recommend other than the beer and maybe the sandwiches, these looked good."
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Celebrating some special occasions and we decided to come here for the dollar oysters special that they have on Friday. This was my second time eating here and I'd have to say that the experiences here are either hit or miss. We started off with 24 oysters a flight of beer. The flight was great and really show cased different flavour profiles. Our waitress was lovely and recommended some amazing choices. Where we were a little disappointed was with the food in total we have 48 oysters and about 5 of them were inedible with a very foul smell and an even worse taste we did mention this to the second waiter who came around to help as they got busier and he said he'd look into it although nothing was done about the situation we didn't even receive an apology for the oysters that had clearly gone off. After we each got the fillet mignon with  the markt salad and sautéed mushrooms and mine had a side of mushroom sauce. One our played arrived mine was missing the mushroom sauce and it took a while before I was able to flag someone down and then a while longer to get the sauce from the kitchen. The market salad was dry and bland we also had to again flag a waitress down to get some vingerette for the salad. Overall if your coming here for drinks especially beer they know what they're doing in terms of food combined with the other experience i had there are better places in the area with better products. If you do come in for oysters make sure to give each one a smell so you don't end up with a mouth of unpleasantness :/

We'll be in Montreal for 4 days and we've been here twice already. We stumbled on this place searching for a liquor store, but one peek inside and I knew we MUST return. The first visit was for a snack and some drinky-poos. We both ordered beer flights, local craft beer flight and sweet & sour. Hubby ordered the Big Twist XL pretzel. And dammit we gave it a good try but the two of us couldn't finish it. It was bigger that Bob's head! We stopped in again today for lunch, drinky-poos and some World Cup soccer. I liked the sweet & sour flight so much I ordered it again. One of the beers tasted exactly like sour cherry blasters candy. Amazing! Hubby really liked the 3 tea beer and enjoyed a few of those. The pork schnitzel was calling to my Austrian heritage and I felt my life wouldn't be complete without ordering that. I was right. The schnitzel was pounded thin, fried perfectly crispy, and covered almost the entire plate with a side of pan gravy for dipping. Perfection. It came with a side of Emmental cheese spaetzle (omg, I could eat a tub of this stuff) and braised purple cabbage, tangy and a touch sweet (exactly like my mom used to make). *wipes away a nostalgic tearWe also ordered a side of crispy house made onion rings and a bier bacon cheese dip with everything pretzels. Every dish was executed to exacting standards, no prepackaged junk to be found. I'm in love. If I could give 6 stars I would. If I could stand out front wearing a beer costume to get people to come in I would. I don't know how I'm going to go back home knowing we have no Bier Markt in Edmonton. I love you Bier Markt, I'll be back. Don't ever change."
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went here for a CrackBerry meetup. It was my first time here but I often did walk by the place but never went in.The CrackBerry event included an alcohol/beer so I had one of their beers. I'm not a real beer drinker which is why I've never gone to this place. I will have the occasional beer if I'm with friends and they order a beer or if I go to a pub or if I'm offered a drink while playing in the casino. The event also included some small appetizers (finger food).Since I had just finished work before showing up to the event, I decided to order something to eat. I decided to go with the poutine. I found the portion size of the poutine to be small for the price (it was roughly the size of a McDonald's poutine) and with my bacon add-on was $10+taxes+tip. Between the 2 beers that I had and the poutine (along with the free small finger food appetizers), I felt satisfied (although not stuffed).I found it to be very loud in the place and could hardly hear myself talk or hear my colleague talk. I didn't have any problems with the service and the staff serving the beer as well as the server who took my poutine order and the person who brought me my order were all friendly. They have free WiFi here but required signing in with an e-mail address so I just opted to use the data on my cellphone.I wouldn't have an issue coming back here especially to try the oysters deal advertised."
/user_details?userid=rrMCS0W5zIvZjk2V9kz_lA,Ariana G.,"Cranston, RI",4 star rating,"Came here after a Canadiens game since it was within walking distance and one of the only restaurants open late on the Monday. We arrived shortly after 10:30pm and we were sat immediately despite the busyness. Upon sitting we were told we had approximately 30 minutes to order from the main menu before they switched over to the late night menu at 11:00pm. I ordered a Somersby Cider which came in a tall glass with ice and the Chicken ABT sandwich. My friend ordered a cheeseburger and coke. I thought the food was really good, affordable, and it came out quickly for how busy they were. The reason I did not give five stars is because the meals weren't exactly as the menu described. My chicken sandwich was supposed to come with tomato, lettuce, chips, jalapeño, and avocado but when I got it there was just lettuce cheese and bacon. Don't get me wrong the food was SO good, but I just don't understand why you would advertise one thing and give a customer another. The same thing happened to my friends cheese burger, it came out and instead of one patty with cheese there were two small patty's on top of each other which made it hard to eat. Overall, each of our meals and drinks were under thirty dollars and the food was very good. Considering the lack of restaurants open late around the arena on a Monday night I would certainly suggest Bier Markt !"

Once up there, on the 3rd floor with a superb view we got installed comfortably. Service was average, they were packed it's understandable and forgivable. However the food has nooo flavour, I never wanted to leave a restaurant that bad. It seems like the meat wasn't seasoned. But great presentation. Better luck next time."

They do not honour reservations and basically do not care !!!We sat upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food..We order a small house salad to start with -that was served  to our table 15 mins after our meal. Hello it is a starter not and ender .I  ordered the large pot of mussels in beer with bacon. The mussels were dry and over cooked and there was a little bit of broth found in the bottom of the pot. The stale bread was not able to soak up the salty broth, the order came with a small order of fries for kids  which were not hot. You think they could afford to serve a proper size of fries. My spouse ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was over cooked and came with cold fries . The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food, service and attitude .Clearly the waitress did care and did nothing to what we said about the meal being over cook and was sure disappointing meal. Sorry to post a bad review but had to be honest !!!"
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I have been to the Bier Markt on many occasions, and each time, I feel like the level of service is getting worse. This time, I was joining a group of girlfriends on a Thursday hockey night, there were lots of people and lots of noise so we could hardly hear each other talk but given the circumstances it was ok. Where I found the service to be poor is that at one point our table was simply without a waitress... which of course makes it difficult to order. I had to hail a random waiter who was passing by so that he could find a person to take care of us. I ordered a few oysters which weren't my cup of tea, I also had a platter with three choices ($ 18) prosciutto, goat cheese and as I wanted to take risks I went for their red tuna poké... which turned out to be brownish, tasteless with extra dry rice. In short, what made the experience memorable is much more the company of my friends rather than what was served throughout the evening. I think it's worth going there just to order their real specialty: beer."

/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"The beer is kind of whatever, and typical of pretty much all bars of this sort.  Acceptable but nothing special.The food was above average with pretty good spins on American classics. The ""steak"" cut calamari was just grilled without breading, served cold with a drizzle of lemon on a lettuce leafs. It was a simple but effective prep, perfect with the poutine. The wings were good.  Drummed sticks trimmed to lollipops then served with buffalo sauce (and something else that tasted sweeter).  Perfectly fried and the buffalo sauce was spot on.  A lot healthier too because wings weren't drenched in the sauce.Crunchy Brussels sprout leaves worked well. A little greasy but that ended up working really well with the citrus on the calamari."

They are very accommodating especially since we usually have a large group. I honestly can't remember what I ordered the first time,  but I really nailed it on my last trip. I ordered a steam pot with poutine fries. Excellent! Seriously I think I was the envy of a few of my friends. I've had poutine before and so far wasn't impressed, but Bier Markt's version is pretty great. I'm glad I gave it another chance. One of friends ordered a schnitzel and it came out almost like a heart. I know that has nothing to do with anything, but it was very cute. They have an impressive beer list and I was even able to find a few that I liked. I highly recommend meeting your server know what you typically drink and letting her custom make a beer flight. I really liked the strawberry beer although most of my beer drinking friends said it was too sweet. Both times the service has been good even though they are always very busy. I'm sure we'll be back next year."

Flavor of the oysters themselves were lacking but good mignonettes and well served on the right kind/size of shaved ice. Enjoyed a couple bites of my friend's delicious calamari, perfectly cooked, and took a beef tartar myself which was very much lacking in flavor, but easily rectified with some salt, pepper and other sauces/lemon available from other dishes on the table. Our server was sweet and helped lift the overall experience. In all, many overpriced dishes and drinks, but not as bad as I was expecting. Would go back for oysters and a 5a7 but not at the top of my list."

This was previously Cueue de Cheval and I always wondered what it was like inside as I never ate at CDC after hearing it was quite overpriced for what you received. The place is quite large with two levels and lots of TV's. We were seated at a big table at the left rear corner of the restaurant. It was a busy Saturday evening and the restaurant was alive. Beer selection is quite large and hence there is a book of many beers available on tap. For the beer lovers it's fantastic. Onto the food. I had selected bier can chicken and spätzle soup. It was extremely salty but I still barely ate it. To the point of it being overkill. This is coming from someone who enjoys Asian food which is typically a bit higher in sodium content. I should have mentioned something to the server but was never asked how it was. For my main I had the big pot of mussels and fries. Which was delicious. Mussels were very fresh plump and the broth served was slightly salty but highly tasty. Fries were crisp, generous serving and went down the hatch no problem. This brought the meal back. My friends all ordered various dishes: charcuterie, the bratwurst board, steak, short rib, one ordered a burger. All were pleasantly pleased. From their reaction I'd say all of them enjoyed their meals were they blown away? I'd rank it as a 3.5/5 for a chain restaurant. Keep in mind pricing is medium high. Overall 3.5 I'd say is a fair rating. If you like beer and hearty man food it's your place!"

If i was here one evening and don't have to drive I'd double my drink totals easily. My only qualm is there was a little too much ice for my liking. If there was a little bit less ice and more delicious sangria this place would have gotten a solid 5 stars.Price-tag is reasonable and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive.

I have also always had pretty friendly service here.However, despite the name, the beer experience is lacking. I dont know whether the beer is stored at the wrong temperature or whether there is an issue with the tap system, but every beer we had tasted ""off"", and these were beers that I have had before elsewhere. Also, the beer list looks impressive at first glance due to its size, but closer inspection shows that most of them are not great. If this place wants to really be a respectable beer bar, then I highly recommend that it focuses on doing a smaller list of higher quality beers, managed and served in the right way."

I'd like to preface this by telling you that I have been to this location several times and everything is always great. But last night was unacceptable. We arrived around 4:30 pm because I know to come early before a show! We got drinks, places out order and bam, the power goes out. Obviously this is not within the restaurants control and we know this. Seeing as how we placed our order before the power went out, we thought we would wait it out for a bit instead of going across the street where they clearly still had power. So we waited and shortly after the power came back on, our apps arrived. So far so good! At this point it is about 5:30. A little while goes by and our server comes over to let us know that the food will be awhile as they are trying to get printers working and what Not. Again, understandable. Now it's almost 630 and our server comes over and tells us no more food.So here we are, 2 hours into our experience and 30 minutes from the show starting, and we are being told no food.We are chill people and restaurant people. We 100% accept that a restaurant of that size would be impossible to run well using paper hand written tickets. I support their decision in this because And it was the right call to make, and I understand it didn't come lightly because of the significant money lost. However I really think they should have some more to accommodate those tables who had placed orders before the power went out. What I am truly upset about here is that after this giant waste of time for us, we are still handed a bill for the full amount of everything we had. There should have been some kind of discount. We were there for 2 hours only to be told no food. 2 hours! it was just kind of a slap in the face to get a bill for over $100 when the 3 of us each had 2 drinks and 2 apps total. They should have done more to preserve the good experience for people, instead they let the printer issue turn everyone's experience into a poor one.An email to the company resulted in a ""we sent managers around to talk to table and it appears yours was missed and for that I am sorry."" No apologies for anything else. Because if their prime location they won't lose any business, but they need to recognize the very poor experience that probably all of their customers had last night. I'll probably still come back. But I will definitely consider other options first next time."

Some friends had burger which looked good and the fried calamari was interesting. Specifically, the calamari was cut in large, thick, fry-sized pieces and the batter was fried to bellow-crispy. I thought it was pretty good - though I prefer more standard preparations.Side note: the resto has parking in the basement. Very convenient if driving into downtown."

The portion was perfect since it wasn't too much food but enough to be filling. However, quality wise the salad was alright , it was fresh but very basic and the chicken burger was lacking flavor and was on the cusp of undercooked. For the price I expected a little better to be honest. Overall , I would come back for the oysters and for some beer but may choose another option for food as the dish I chose wasn't anything special."

The in-house sauce with raffish was amazing!We also had mussels, which were also super fresh. It was cooked well. However, it was a a bit salty. For mains to share, we had the pesto pizza with smoked chicken. The pesto sauce was fresh. However, the chicken, tomatoes, and cheese weren't evenly spread out. The bread was and crispy. However, it didn't feel as fresh. Lastly, we ended with orange cheesecake with gingersnap smackers. The cheesecake was great! Not too sweet or heavy. The service there was decent."

Set off to explore . Made 8:30 reservations and glad I did. Packed house.  On a  Sunday night to boot!Walked in at  8:28 and our table was ready.They advertise 130 beers from over 30 countries! I was thinking wow. Thank god we walked to this place cause this might be dangerous!  Unfortunately they only offer 3 types of ""fixed"" flights.  A European, and Canadian & a IPA mix.  Too bad you couldn't mix and match.  They did have about 30 Taps.  The rest bottles or cans.  He ordered a Rochefort 10 it's a Belgian quadruple .  14.00 a bottle, and he said it was worth it.  He also had the Canadian flight special at 15.00I had a ""Ceaser"" cocktail.  A version of a Bloody Mary but even better.  It was so good.  Real good.  Wish I could take 3 to go!! Only 9.00 and it's a free appetizer to boot!  It had dried sausage pickles smoked Gouda candied bacon on a skewer.  Absolutely delicious! We decided on the 50 ounce Tomahawk!  Comes with bone marrow, fingerling potatoes, baby bok choy and FF's.  Since it came  with potatoes already I asked if we could skip the ff's and get a salad.  She said fine.  But I was charged 7.00 for lettuce with no dressing.  Not a big deal but 7.00? $ 99.00 for a dinner for two, and  7.00 for lettuce is crazy.  That aside, it was good. Ordered it medium rare, came out medium.  Didn't say anything,  cause you can't change medium.  I figured in my head, it's not 99.00 to me, since the US dollar is strong here, so I let it go.  Trust me if it was back home, that steak would have gone back!! Service was good.  Our waitress was so sweet.  The place  had a upscale feel to it even though it had TV's neatly displayed all over.  Overall the beer added the extra star to the 3 star food rating making this  a 4 star review!"

The collection of beers on tap from all over the world is impressive and this is my main motivation to come back to this place. Particularly my favorite Fruli strawberry beer from Belgium. They also offer some local brews from the best producers as DDC. I love the informative menu that would provide all the possible details on the beer types, it is educative in fact. The bar is perfect spot for after game pint or two, but I would not recommend before the game as the happy hour business crowd is still dominating the space, not my vibe really. The pub is spacious and the bars offer comfortable seats, my preferred spot being on the second floor. I haven't really tried the food except for few snacks, the poutine is nothing to write for, but the chicken wings are spicy and will drink another pint for you. Service may be spotty depending on the time and day, but sitting on the bar offers safety, the bar tenders would always make sure your glass is full. Strawberry cheers!!!!"

The Bier mart is nice but very loud sports pub . The  2 male hostess were rude and very unprofessional. They could not find our reservation at first and when they did they sat us upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible.I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was dry (over cooked) and asked for vegetables instead of fries  was suppose to but came with cold fries . We order a small house salad to start with -that-was brought to our table 15 mins after our meal. My spouse ordered the large pot of mussels in beer with bacon. The mussels were over cooked and there was very little broth (which was very salty and bitter) in the pot. The stale bread was not able to soak up the salty broth, the order came with a small order of fries for kids  which were not hot. You think for $20 they could afford to give a proper order size of fries. The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food, service and attitude .Clearly the waitress nor management cared when we said this was sure disappointing."

The place itself and ambiance is fantastic.Amazing beer selection. They have so many to offer, you can't be disappointed. Down side for me was the food. We ordered the Merchant Kobe burger and the Chicken Flammekueche. To make the story short, in both dishes I found hard pieces within the meat, which I couldn't identify, probably cartilage. I'm not being pretentious, but the hard pieces found in the burger were literally pebbles. We then spoke with the manager and he offered us a second Kobe burger, but we refused. Unfortunately, I had already lost my appetite. He offered us two desserts. He also mentioned he didn't have any quality control over the meat. Not cool.At least, desserts were good.For what we were paying, the quality of the meat wasn't worth it. I understand they're new to the markt!, but they definitely need to change up a few things."

I settled on their sangria (delicious and sweet made with Strawberry wheat beer).There was a live band playing during our visit and they were quite good.

/user_details?userid=SPxVxXeGoE2qMejvDXu3tg,Vanessa D.,"Markham, Canada",2 star rating,"This review would have been five stars, if I had just left my visit to Friday, instead of coming again Sunday night. So I came in on Friday evening with my boyfriend; our server was amazing! She was friendly, super helpful and knowledgeable with her menu (she gave great suggestions that I ended up loving), and she checked in on us as a server should.Now, I'm not from Montreal, and I have been a server myself for nearly a decade. I'm a firm believer that no customer owes you a tip, and your tips are a reflection of your service (that, or maybe the customer is just cheap af, who knows). With that being said, here's how my Sunday evening at this place turned out:My boyfriend and I were spending our last night in Montreal close by our hotel (we stayed here for three days, on Victoria Day long weekend). We opted to stay close by, just to save time on having to travel back to our hotel seeing as though we'd be leaving the next day.  We decided on coming back to bier market since we had a good time on Friday. We walked in (downstairs was pretty packed) stood by the hostess stand for a minute, and I noticed the bartender (no one else was on the floor) being crazy busy; you could see on her face she was prioritizing what she needed to do. Since no one had approached us we decided to seat ourselves. Grabbed a high top table right in front of the bar.  We sat there for a few minutes, STILL no one had approached us, and I began to tell my boyfriend about how much I can sympathize with the bartender because at this point it seemed like she was working the entire first floor alone, and I remembered how stressed I was doing the same. So we patiently waited. And she finally came along, before she took our drink order I asked for a food menu, which was my mistake, cause that added another two minutes to our wait time. We finally got our order out of the way and then our food and beer came. While sitting there, just observing, she was totally running around like a headless chicken, at this point it seemed like no one else was working in the place, (which I know wasn't true because more than enough people ended up downstairs around closing time). She had sooo many dirty tables with cups everywhere sitting for over ten minutes before any other workers came around to help. At this point, that's ridiculous. You don't leave your staff hanging like that. Even if their service is amazing, no single person can handle over forty people in a room without hella delayed service, and leaving the place looking like a disaster. Yeah the money might be great at the end of the night, but your shitty service will be remembered. So near the end, we asked for another pint each, and the bill. Bill was brought then paid. As a server, I've been left pretty shitty tips. But hey, that's life, you get shitty tips with shitty or excellent service. You're lucky to even receive a tip at all.This bartender, I don't even know her name because she never told us, nor was it on the bill (I could be blind if it is)  came back up to us to ask if there was something wrong with our time there. I already knew where this convo was going to go, and I knew my big mouth would just get me in trouble so I left it up to my boyfriend. She proceeded to remind us that a normal tip is roughly 15%. Ok hi, I would leave NO tip for someone who gave me shit service, because again customers do not OWE you anything. I would throw a hundred dollar bill at you as a tip if I believed you deserved it.Anyway, I only encountered two servers at this place, and this place could use another lovely server from Friday for their Sunday evenings. And maybe schedule another server because this bartender can NOT execute great service in a place that big with that many people. Again, if unless you were superwoman, I don't know who would be able to.Don't come here on a Sunday unless you want to wait"

If you are looking for fancy, maybe this isn't the place for you, but we started with the Market Sharing Board of cured meats and cheese, which was a perfect intro to the main meal - my wife had the Mussells + Frites, and I had the Pork Schnitzel (the spätzle was delicious, BTW).

The service people are friendly too. The only two knocks that I have on this place is that the service is very slow. I waited an hour for my plate on a Sunday night. They should do more to prepare their customers for the length of the wait, which can be prepared to ones' having to atone in purgatory before finally being rewarded. The other is that the food is a bit pricey and can be compared to Gibby's. All in all, I would still recommend it. The place is nice and they have lots of Monitors showing Live sports. Always a plus for me.Boyd"

The ambiance, decor are good for a sports bar. The high chairs start to get annoying/uncomfortable after awhile.Avoid their burgers like the plague. The burgers are burnt (both the meat and the bread) and bland. Afterwards, I spent a better part of the night trying to get rid of the nasty aftertaste. The price for the burger was outrageous-$20 for a nasty burger and small sweet potato fries.Go to watch the game/hang out with friends and drink beer, but don't eat there!"

On one of my visits to Toronto I remarked that we needed more places that had a ridiculous variety of beer. Happily bier market opened up. Being a franchise, one can only expect so much. The waitresses are generally friendly, some more friendly then others but I prefer to focus on the experience, food and beer. The food for the most part has been good. The one issue I take with the food was a steak I had ordered that was tough and had a vein going through it. I'd stay away from the steaks but there are a lot of other options like he charcrut plate that's great everything. Their burger is solid and their sliders / hot dogs were nicely prepared. The schnitzel was also good but note it's strong on the capers.The beer selection is great but I suggest looking at the pairings and try something new whenever you can. Even asking the wait staff for is good for ideas.I'd definitely go back and recommend it as well."

They were on a special too, a buck an oyster, compared to their usual 3$. Only downside is our food came all at different times, so it was a little awkward, half of us didn't want to eat infont of the other starving half, so some were sharing (that's how I ended up trying the oysters) some were waiting for everyone to get their food, so we ended with cold food ourselves, it's not our waitress' fault, the place was busy, and we were a big table, so I'm sure they were doing their best.

/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A touristy restaurant that lacks attention to the clientele, and quality of food. Our latest visit to Bier Markt for a weekday lunch turned out to be nothing else but an expensive disappointment. Although I have been to Bier Markt twice before, this last experience took me by surprise as to how things changed for the worse. Upon our arrival for a 1:30pm weekday lunch, we were seated upstairs to a very small, uncomfortable table, in a very dark sector. Quite depressing. I suppose the bright big TV and the blasting terrible music was the only thing that kept that sector lively. While looking around, I've noticed that there was another sector upstairs with windows and far more spacious and better ambience. Sadly, we paid the unexpected consequences of having a worse waiter service. Shortly after we sat down, our waiter arrived. So far things are going OK. Right away we ordered our meals. Mussels in a sauce and a chicken burger with fries. We were a table of two and both times our waiter was quite pushy in offering us sweet potato fries instead for $1.00 extra. Of course that an extra dollar for his tip. We said, no. Since we arrived for a late lunch at 1:30pm, we are quite hungry. So our 45 minute wait for mussels and a chicken burger was not sitting well for either one of us. Finally our meals have arrived. Not once did our waiter took the time to apologize till I very kindly mentioned the such long wait. His response and I quote ""Oh sorry, our kitchen staff had gone on break when I placed in your order, I'm sorry about that""  Somehow my appetite was being replaced by frustration. As soon as we took a bite of our meal, both of our fries were cold and soggy. The mussels were warm-ish. My sandwich, well the bread was rubbery, the chicken was cooked till dry as sand paper. Again, I politely called our waiter and mentioned the fries. He said, oh sorry about that. Let me get you another batch. Soon after our waiter returns to our table and informs us that the fries will take about 5 minutes since they didn't have a batch made. So we waited, yet again!Finally,y we finished our meal. I clearly indicated to our waiter that we were not pleased with our meal and the long wait. He simply said ""I'm sorry for that."" The apology and the service both felt quite cold, short, and very unprofessional for a simple lunch of two people with one beer that costed $55.00"

Well we needed some more space so I moved an empty plate to the empty table next to me. The hostess saw it, asked if it was my plate and put it back on the table and proceeded to lecture me on how they clear the tables. Wow!

The cocktails are really great plus they have a full bar so they can make you whatever you wish. The food is good every time I've been, the last meal I had was the ahi tuna. It was perfectly seared and the potatoes and greens were delicious. I also had the bavarian pretzels which were also unexpectedly large with just the right amount of salt on them, and the hot-mustard sauce went very well with it too! However I have to say I'm on the fence for this review because I've visited BierMarkt three times now and the service has been hit or miss. I either got a cheery waitress that smiled and giggled at everything I said, or an irritated waitress that just answers 'I don't know' when you ask her a question about the menu and looks at you as if she expects you to simply choose something else instead of offering to check with the kitchen/bartender.

The service: The bartenders are amazing, knowledgeable and will lead you down the right path to find the perfect beer for you.  The service at the tables was a little slow, but they were busy, so there's that.The music:  Two nights in a row they had a DJ who was actually mixing live, which you don't see much anymore.  He had a really good mix of music for all to enjoy.  There was one night with a live band that was absolutely awful.

/user_details?userid=gRRaQoC9TF_CiPABk3XOBw,Dan C.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't understand Montrealers automatic assumption that any restaurant that is part of a chain must be inherently bad. Montrealers are just not used to chains from away coming to town. Few do as Quebec laws and society make it so difficult to do business here. Yes this is part of a Toronto based chain. So what?It happens to be a successful chain (hence the expansion). Montrealers should be glad to have an expanded choice of places to eat and fill the void between the over the top pretentiousness and trendiness of the likes of Toqué and au pied de cochon, and la belle province and schwartz's. This is a well crafted concept with a fantastic menu and an amazing beer list. They are passionate about their food and beer and the service is pretty good too. Don't like it don't go there but don't criticise them for doing something different if they do it well. I have been a fan of the Biermarkt since I first encountered them in Toronto. I even tried to work for them. That didn't work out but I still love the atmosphere, menu and service. The Montreal location is ideal. In the old queue de cheval building they have turned down the pretentiousness of the old decor with their take on warm European pub/brauhaus chic. As ever the menu is an inspired and tasty nod to basic European staples like moules frites and schnitzel both pork and veal. I had the bavette with fries cooked a perfect medium rare. Ask for a side of curry Mayo with your frites. Our server Daphne was attentive and friendly. The only negative I could find was the spider webs on the column above our table beautifully spotlighted by the light over the table. Time to follow up with the cleaning crew about high dusting!

I ordered the mussels from their vast and appealing menu, thinking this would be a sure bet. But the mussels were not cooked enough. Some were still fishy, too soft, and many had not had time to open. I also believe that the loads of garlic and onions that were thrown in there were raw. Raw garlic and onions, really? Basically, the entire thing just wasn't cooked! Moreover, service quickly became overwhelmed and disorganized, and we just lost our server...I will say I appreciated that they did not charge me for the mussels I did not eat, and the rest of the dishes looked delish - burgers, salads, poutines...

This week we were granted the incredible opportunity to sample the libations housed at the Bier Markt and boy did we sample them. Boasting an inventory of over 150 biers from 30 countries, there is certainly a choice for every taste and every budget including a $60 bottle of Westvleteren. The drink menu has over thirty pages of choices, but to be fair the last few pages are non-bier options such as cocktails and wines. However as this is a bier mecca, don't be surprised when your cocktail is made with bier. To the best of our knowledge there is no bier in the wine.The Montreal location is on Rene Levesque Blvd one block away from the home of the Habs, the Bell Centre.  With three floors available for dinning, there is room for everyone, before, during and after the game. Looking for some music, you can find a cover band every Thursday evening and a live DJ on Friday and Saturday. The main floor of the restaurant has a very casual flair. With bistro tables and stools it is easy to move about from table to table,  it is a welcoming area and great for casual dining or just a few glasses of bier. The upper two floors are designated as more formal dining areas, and can accommodate any size party. There is also a private room available for lunch meetings or celebrations. If you need something special, just contact Lawrence or David and they will be happy to make your event unique and of course full of bier.We were invited to sample a lunch menu and were served by the amazing Max. If every server is as attentive as Max, you can be sure you will be well taken care of. Our meal started with the make your own charcuterie board, with the choice of two meats and one cheese. Larger boards are available for groups or you can choose a pre-designed board. As with everything on the menu, there is a bier pairing suggestion. We were presented with a glass of Stiegl lager, and it complemented the smokeyness of the cheese perfectly.For round two we were served a candied bacon poutine. It was described to us as a dream poutine, and it was a dream to eat it. Along side the dish was a healthy portion of dunkle duck wings. Dry-spiced with a rub the wings are served with two types of dipping sauce, but were also delicious all on their own. The accompanying bier was the Goose Island Honker's Ale. Alternating sips with bites of food, the combination of spices and the ale brought forward flavours we had never before experienced.Next came the Angus beef tartar. If you are a fan of tartar, this classic fare will not disappoint. With the beef on the bottom, a layer of toasted baguette slices and topped with greens, this dish was prepared to perfection. How do you top perfection but add the perfect pairing. This time it was the triple brewed Tripel Karmellet Ale. The caramel taste of the bier only made the tartar taste even better.Finally we ended our meal with both dessert and of course another bier. For dessert, a bag of fresh and tasty sugared doughnuts with a coffee English cream dip for what else but dipping. You may not think that bier would go well with sugared doughnuts and were we surprised at how well the glass of Grimbergen Dubbel Abby Ale did. This strong dark ale, gave the doughnuts a completely new taste.We thoroughly enjoyed the food, the bier and the service at the Bier Markt. We have decided that the motto is right Bier is Beautiful and we loved every drop of it."

PROs:- Attention to detail:  from toasting buns to homemade BBQ sauce, the subtle things come together to create a burger that's better than the sum of its parts- Special hot plate kept my burger warm (a detail special enough to merit it's own bullet)- Great location for downtown bar hopping- $20 beer sampler turnstile- Service was 10/10 fast & friendlyCONs- Location alone adds 15%-20% to the price tag. I would be a regular if they managed to bring the pricing down to Les 3 Brasseurs' level outside the downtown core.- Others at the table complained about mussels' ""fishy-ness."" Not having ever tried mussels, all I can testify to is that they stank up the table.OVERALL- Upgraded pub food at an upgraded price"
/user_details?userid=1652MDlbA0pOtsq7U1Ygow,Clayton V.,"Redmond, WA",3 star rating,"Great selection of beer, convenient downtown location, ample seating, what's not to love right? Well, a few things. I teeter-tottered between two and three stars for Bier Markt for awhile. Ultimately, it arrives at three because I'll go back.  The Good:Great beer selection, Plenty of taps, plenty of bottle choices, great menu for those not familiar. Also, they even do beer pairing recommendations! The menu, is well rounded, and has great lunch choices. The ambiance is fantastic. On paper, this is a great lunch spot. A nice touch is the correct use of appropriate glasses for the various styles of beer. Good prices on most things in bottle. Free coat check during winter.The Bad:Consistency and speed. Lunch rushes are always hard on a new establishment, and it shows. Unlike it's Ontario brethren, the kitchen was slow. Being seated at the bar, the bar tender was attentive, friendly, warm. Much to offset the nearly 35-45 minute wait for anything coming out of the kitchen, Alas, when over half an hour had passed without seeing a french fry, I inquired, and was informed it was typical for 40+ minute waits for the kitchen. 40 minutes? Downtown? For lunch? Eek, for a place perfect to catering to the businessman lunch, that hour is a hard time constraint.  As to consistency, personally my fries we're perfect, my burger over cooked (I'm not a fan of well-done), my companion however received under-seasoned fries, but a nice medium burger.  I'll chalk this up to a kitchen that's behind, and that to being young. Given the wait, result, and price, it's disappointing. TL;DR, Issues, Pricey,  but the beer selection and prospect of greatness will make me revisit Bier Markt, and this review in the future. Skip it for now if you're trying to get in an hour lunch break, or get there early."

The beer menu is very impressive, and the pairings are helpful. The problem is in the service. We had to ask for water twice, and not enough was delivered for our full party. Not once did they come around offering refills. We were a party of 18, two of the orders were mistaken and neither time did the staff offer to switch it. The service was already slow and we were in a rush, so we didn't bother insisting. I ordered a salad on the menu but asked them to make it ""vegan"" (no meat or dairy). It was a 20$ salad, my two friends next to me ordered the same. Our plates were all the very same size, and in the end we were all charged the same amount...despite me having half of what my two friends received. The waiter also short-changed me in the end, acknowledged that he did, then disappeared. Additionally, my cousin was charged for one beer that was never delivered. This could have been avoided had they asked even once if we were satisfied. If there is a specific and exotic beer you'd like to try, go to beermarkt. If you are looking for food and service that reflect such a high markup--go anywhere but."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I tend to avoid the big flashy restaurants... especially in the ones in the downtown core. Part of me is always leery. When your main clientele is tourists and the business crowd - simply by location alone - there is a good chance that the food is not necessarily up to par with the cost associated to the meal. Now, I am always willing to be proven wrong so when I had a chance to try Bier Markt for the first time recently, I went in with an open mind.For the uninformed, Bier Markt is a Toronto chain of restaurants that came to Montreal and took over the old Queue de Cheval location in front of the Bell Centre. Bier Markt's claim to fame is the ridiculous amount of beers they have available - over 150 beers from 30 different countries. The selection is extremely varied and quite good. The beer menu is nicely elaborate. It does a great job of categorizing and describing each beer to help with selection. The prices vary widely though which is a bit strange. I also appreciated that the food menu provides recommendations with pairing for each dish. For a restaurant like this, that detail is essential and provides a nice way to try new beers.Foodwise, the menu is a mixture of beer garden and classic bar/pub fare. My friends and I went for three starters initially. First up was the French onion soup au gratin with caramelized onions, house veal stock, toasted bread and Gruyère cheese. Personally I did not try it but the response from my friends was good - not great.Next was the baked Brie with Granny Smith apples, lingonberry jam, roasted pecans, pickles and baguette crisps. The jam was nice but once again, overall the dish was good, not great. The portion size was only not that great considering its cost either.The final entree was the baked crab dip - wild Canadian rock crab, white cheddar, cream cheese, Old Bay spices and toasted house flatbread. This was a more interesting and well done dish. Very creamy with nice pieces of meaty crab within. Main issue once again though was the size relative to the price. Very limited amount of flatbread and frankly, this appetizer was barely sufficient for me much less as a dish to share - which at its price point, it needs to be.Prior to the description of the mains, I will just take a moment to discuss the service. Now, for the most part, I am pretty relaxed about service in general - I simply want timely, friendly with a good handle of the menu. However, there are a few things that are BIG no-nos for me. One of them is very simple - you should never serve the next course without clearing the table first. During our meal, not only was that done but that was after all the empty dishes were left in front of us for about 20 minutes before serving. On top of that, the waitresses serving our table had no clue who had which main so the second course became a awkward and complicated dance of simultaneously removing, moving temporary around and serving dishes. And then, the same thing was repeated at dessert time later on! With the number of waitresses working around us, these were big red flags about the quality of service.Back to the food now. The first main was the Merchant burger - 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, smoked bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, ""Bier 58"" sauce, toasted bun with house frites. A good sized burger - a little overcooked for my liking but still flavourful. A solid burger but again for its price, more was hoped for.I personally went with the Chicken ABT - fresh chargrilled chicken breast, avocado, crisp smoked bacon, vine-ripe tomato, shaved iceberg lettuce and honey Dijon aioli in a Portuguese roll served with fries. The sandwich was good but somehow left me underwhelmed and wishing I had ordering something else. Some extra aioli and avocado may have helped to provide more kick but otherwise I felt the sandwich lacked pop. The fries were nice and crisp at least - very classic bistro style.The final main was the smoked pork back ribs which are spice-rubbed and smoked for 6 hours, served with a golden BBQ sauce, fries and a red cabbage & caraway slaw. The ribs were nice and tender but because the sauce needed to be added by the client, they were a little dry. The BBQ sauce was a necessity to add, not a choice.The final dish we ordered was the waffle ice cream sandwich - house-baked chocolate waffles served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Best thing we had all night - creative, chocolatey and rich. Always nice to end a meal on a positive.In the end, Bier Markt left me cold. The beer selection was nice and varied - definitely the draw to coming back. However, the food was uninspiring and simply okay. The service was poor. Okay food can be acceptable at certain times but not when my personal bill was 80$ without tip. At that price, there are a heck of a lot better options I can enjoy. Bier Markt is a great happy hour spot for excellent beer but not a worthwhile dining option.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=hW2oVv5VCrnVWstUWBdvNw,Tom R.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"This is a bit tough to review because for the most part I enjoyed myself at Bier Markt, until later that evening when I got sick.   Unfortunately food poisoning is an automatic 1 star in my books. First the good.   The building is very nice. Its a new construction with a very classy retro interior, although their enthusiasm for all things Belgian is over the top (more on that later). We were seated on the second floor near the staircase.   They have 150 different types of beer, 30 or so on tap and the menu is really good about explaining the beers and providing food pairing suggestions.   A great place for those of us who support beer getting the same love as wine or scotch.   Our server was also very friendly and helpful, and food was delivered in a timely matter (too timely as it turned out).  We started by sharing a short rib Poutine that was excellent and for a main my girlfriend had a flammekouch (a pizza esque creation) that she said was excellent.   I went for the very Belgian moules frites in a white wine and shallot sauce.  Very promising.Now the bad.  When I mentioned the food came too quick, it was because quite a few of the mussels were undercooked.   I am not a mussel connoisseur and I already had a couple of beers in me so I didn't really notice at first, I thought they were just really fresh.  When my girlfriend tried a couple she noticed the undercookedness, by which point it was too late.  Fortunately I have a tough stomach but two days later I am still feeling a bit nauseated.  It happens that sometimes a couple of mussels are not cooked but to have almost half of them is no good.  One last comment is that they are disturbingly enthusiastic about the peeing boy statue.  There is a giant replica on the front of the place and another overlooking the stairs, which have the statue pointed over your head, a tad creepy.Its too bad that my experience ended the way it did because this place actually is pretty good, just avoid the mussels."

I was with a bunch of people who chose this and it is NOT good. They were all disappointed. Go to la Banquise instead. I had a burger and it was not cooked inside. Service was very long and the waitress was completely lost in the orders. Go to  Hurley's, McKibbins or Old yer Orchard instead of paying too much for lower quality food and service."

I ordered two starters as my meal, along with a pint of cider, and with tax and tip was $30, very reasonable. I have to be critical, their appetizer pretzels are awesome however the mustard served with them was full of horseradish or something, and it was FAR too hot for me. However, one of the people I was eating with loved it, so that's more personal taste than anything. I did have a pretty bad experience when dipping my pretzel for the first time as there was no warning on the menu or from the server as to how hot this stuff is. I also ordered an appetizer sized candied bacon poutine which was plenty large enough for my meal. Fries were nice and all the toppings went well together. I would visit again."

The handbook they give to choose your poison is descriptive and easy to navigate. I will say the waitresses didn't really inspire confidence in regards to what they had for drinks (I don't expect them to memorize the whole book...). The food is delicious and pairings are suggested. What stopped this place from getting a 4 on 5 is that certain beers on the menu were questionable. For example, a bottle of Corona was simply overpriced. Not really a menu exclusively for craft beers. But hey, one man's trash is another man's treasure. I would go again with friends."

The beer menu gives you an extensive description of beers. Food wise.  We only tried the charcuterie plate. While it was good.  It probably wasn't the best cured meats I've tasted.  Solid. But just not mind blowing amazing.  The beers we tried were really good.  Being in Canada. I stuck with mostly Canadian beers and all of them were really really good. Service was great. Waitress was super friendly and accommodating to our large group of rowdy guys.

Good atmosphere/energy to be in before a hockey game.We started with ""Poutine Tour"" which was tasty/fun, then had the Bouillabaisse and the Merchant (Wagyu Beef) Burger. The Bouillabaisse was missing some of the ingredients they had listed on the menu, though the flavour was good enough. The burger was served medium rare, which was pretty underdone for our taste, and we weren't advised that it would not be cooked through when we placed our order."
/user_details?userid=KTyWMF0SvXbgL3FMCNpaAA,Victoria S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As my first experience at a Bier Markt(Yes, it's a chain!) I don't have any major complaints about the restaurant. The staff, very friendly and professional. The ambiance, loud! The background music was being covered by the voices of the clients.. So a bit too much noise in the background for my taste.  The food in general was fantastic! Served warm, average size portions, not too small and not overly big.. Simply perfect! Nicely presentable as well. The varieties of beers is fantastic, yet overwhelming! 50+ varieties of beer, which one to choose? Ask the waitresses and they will guide you quite nicely. This is not a pub, a bar or a place to chill. This is an upscale restaurant with authentic food from Belgium. Again not a single complaint about the food or the staff. What's the VERY disappointing part of my entire experience? The parking! An absolute NIGHTMARE!. Why? Well the restaraunt does not have it's own parking lot or valet. So they offer you to park at the Sheraton(Next door) and show them that you went to the restaurant and the hotel will parking cost in half. Not quite! The parking costed me $30(For two hours!) And the parking staff refused to give me a discount, regardless of what the restaurant had told me. Yes, I showed them proof I was a client at the restaurant and the parking staff said( Sorry, we can't do anything about it.. $30 please!) Unless you're VERY curious about this restaurant, or willing to walk a bit by having to take the metro or bus.. Find another place where parking is accessible and a good value as well. The whole parking situation really turned me off. Consider the manager of the restaurant only said ""Sorry you experienced that, we will talk with the parking staff"" Ok, but where's my discount?! I was suppose to pay(Told by the restaurant) $10.00 NOT $30.00. Think wisely before you go here."

/user_details?userid=FzziaaloswaPjrBbKGrI0w,Carrie S.,"Cheyenne, WY",3 star rating,The two beers I tried were spot on! The crab dip was yummy and exactly what was described. But I am a single female and I sat at the bar. I felt ignored by my server. When I left the tip she asked me if everything was ok. I said no and that I felt ignored. She said she was sorry that I felt that way. I understand she was busy. But she was conversing with other people at the bar but not me. Also she presented the pay machine without asking me anything else. It was only after seeing the 10% tip that she asked or ever looked at me. I should note that going into a sports bar as a single female can be intimidating and I may be being overly critical for a server that is not used to patrons such as myself.
/user_details?userid=5EM7JlbNWw4jblBgQV1AfQ,Joe F.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",1 star rating,Our party of 18 arrived at 615 and after waiting a half hour our overwhelmed and in impressive waitress finally came around for our food orders. It took over two hours for our food to arrive. At no point did pour waitress come to our table and apologize for the inexcusable wait time. The absentee manager never came to our table and we had to track him down regarding the status of or meal and when we finally located him he gave a hollow and meaningless excuse that it is busy tonight. If their management staff is under the impression that waiting two hours is acceptable then the root of the problem starts from the top down. If you like tourist traps with overpriced beers and subpar wait staff then this fraudulent beer garden is right for you. I am writing this review at our table and it's 930. The waitress is no where to be found and our glasses are as empty as our patience as this hoax of a beer garden.

Stay away from their flammekueches, its dry, un-flavourful and sad. Steak is meh. You come here for the beer, so maybe stick with appetizers or the fondu."

Made follow up phone calls to verify and confirm they could accommodate a group of our size. Upon arrival we were led upstairs to a nice table beside the upper bar and although all appearances looked positive it went downhill from there. 35 mins to get water served to the table, almost an hour for alcoholic drinks to arrive and food perhaps 2 hours. The adjacent table of 15 were served before us which was maddening. Manager was clueless and after speaking to him for an explanation he did nothing for us. Appetizers & Entrees came out at staggered times making things difficult. The $100 Tomahawk steak arrived overcooked and was sent back. My ribs arrived cold. Our server, although nice, was serving multiple other tables and could not keep up. Server dropped a wine glass which shattered all over my friend arm but no apologies given or concern. I was embarrassed to bring my party of 18 here."
/user_details?userid=RAsD7s8cq6UEsXucyl6XKg,Terrie A.,"Farmingdale, NY",3 star rating,"This place was totally packed when we went so I understand why service was slow. But it was SO slow! We ordered an appetizer when he came to the table for our drink order (the poutine tour). We only wanted to stay for an hour because we were going to the Canadiens game after dinner. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was incredible. But our waiter didn't come back to take our order. We were completely done with our app and finished a round of beers and he was still not back. We then decided to just leave and eat something at the game so we asked him for the check. He came back twice to help the couple at our shared table, but didn't bring our check. When we asked him again, he said ""you want the check?"" ""Yes, yes we want the check"". Then we waited even longer and he finally showed up with the check probably around 15 minutes later. It was very frustrating. It didn't seem like we were asking for much. Being a waitress in a busy restaurant, I understand busy. But I know that printing out a bill takes literally 5 seconds. I would definitely try Bier Markt again, but will make sure to leave lots of extra time for the slow service. And the poutine tour was delicious- definitely a must-try. 3 different types: traditional, pastrami, and candied bacon - all 3 were incredible."

We loved it - took beer sampler and tried different brews of beers. They also have a great Poutine - gooey french fries full of cheesy and bacon goodness.  Probably loaded with calories, but oh, was it good... They pronounce it over there as [poot'seen].  A must-try ... at least we loved it. It is fairly expensive, and we had to wait longer than we would expect.  However it did not appear to be a systematic thing - there was a huge group which kept our waitress on her toes."

I was surprised at the quality of the food, given the crowds and the size.  And yes, it was a bit loud, but service was very good.  Mussels and fries were delicious and very fresh, as was the ahi tuna burger.  The fried gouda cheese appetizer was delicious.  So was the donut dessert.  The price tag was a bit high, but I never mind paying a little more when I leave happy with the food and service.  I'd definitely go back."

What an epic disappointment. We arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday to a seriously overcrowded and ridiculously loud restaurant. We were invited to 'try to find a place to sit' while we waited for our table to become available. The place was SO packed we couldn't even move through the room! Beyond that, the music was at club level and I had to ask the greeter 4 times to repeat what she had said. It was 6pm! TURN THE FLIPPIN' MUSIC DOWN! We waited 25 minutes into our reservation and our table was still not ready with the server telling us the current occupants were 'in no rush to leave'. Well isn't that great! Glad I made reservations! We left and went to Hurley's Irish Pub. I'd like to try this place again but why waste my time when you can't even get your reserved table?"

Went here this past Friday during lunch. I ordered steak with fries. When another waitress brought and placed my food on the table, she just placed it quickly and left without noticing I did not have eating utencils. I had to wait another 10 minutes for my server to come back so that I could ask her for a knife and fork.The steak was charred and chewy on one side. After I ate, I was still hungry so I asked for the menu again. I ordered a soup. After 30 minutes of waiting, I canceled the soup and asked for the bill. I informed the waitress that the steak was burned and showed her the pieces I had chiseled off, but she didn't seem to care. This place is expensive, the service is horrible, and the food is not worth it. I also overheard the lady next to me complaining that her salad was not good. Being that this is Montreal, and that there is plenty of culinary competition, don't waste your time with this place, unless you are just coming to drink."
