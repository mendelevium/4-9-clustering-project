/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,After celebrating yelps 15th birthday at a bar near by I was starving and happened to walk by dirty dogs which had been on my list of places to eat for a while now and I decided to stop in. When I arrived we were told that the place would be closing in 45 minutes so if I wanted drinks I had to keep that in mind I obviously took that asa challenge and ordered a drink that was 2L. And of course a dirty dog.The dog itself can be ordered with beef pork or veggie as a base which I thought was a great option. I decided on getting the queb which had bbq sauce and caramelized onions and went well with that 2L Moscow mule I was drinking.Overall the service was great and the food was pretty good I'd come back and try more thing when I wasn't in a rush to get everything finished

Place isn't huge and a bit noisy at night -- but you can get your fix here. Note -- It's NOT heath food but you only live once, right? -- We tried the basic -- fries, gravy, cheese curds.  Never even knew this food existed before -- good for the munchies!"

She was beyond amazing, very active serving almost all the tables. She was friendly with a big smile. She made our experience great. On the other hand, I wasn't amazed by the food. It was good but not what I was expecting. Kudos to the staff for being so friendly and attentive."

If you want to make your taste buds dance then your belly explode, this is the place to go.Had just the small size Notorious P.I.G and hardly finished it.House beer here is a light lager. Tasty. I'd totally drink a pitcher.Service was super great. So excited to kick off patio season here."
/user_details?userid=c-dchuYjRCwJVstIE5KnMQ,Mary V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"2 stars saved by the poutineEverything else 1 starHighly disappointing experience both service and food wise. I am BIG on customer service which is huge factor that makes me want to come back and recommend to my fellow Yelpers. The other factor of course being the quality of the food. Was super stoked to try this place for the first time with my boyfriend due to the popularity. We went to the location on St Laurent Blvd. We were seated inside to get some protection from the blazing heat. The menu took few minutes to cruze through. We ordered the small portion mac chicken poutine to share which is 4 cheese mac n cheese, popcorn chicken and Dirty Dog BBQ sauce. This dish was the best one, at $13. The fries and cheese were tasty with the sauce and I liked the chicken. We shared the Notorious P.I.G. hot dog which was overpriced at $13.50. It is an 8 hour pulled pork, DD BBQ sauce, caramelized onions. The pulled pork definitely not braised making it bland and hella dry. Domage. We had three different servers come to the table during the service. Yelpers warn about slow service, they are spot on. No one ever refilled our water or asked if we needed anything. Once we finished we stood by the cash to pay for 10 minutes. Several servers passed by, looked at us but no ever asked what we needed. I had to stop somone behind the register to ask to pay the bill. We left hungry and contimplated on getting steamies at Belle Province. I opted for a tasty ice cream instead. Don't believe the hype. Will not venture to their newst location near Concordia."

My gf planned to go here with her girls following her birthday chilling at the park. I was recommended by one of her friends to have the Chicken Mac'waffle poutine. The potine is topped with Mac and cheese and served with a waffle and a piece of fried chicken. Because of their creativity and execution of this dish I had to deliver 5 stars. Best,Brandon"

/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Before yesterday, I hadn't had a hotdog in years! And boy, was I in for a real treat!I was walking pass the Dirty Dogs St. Laurent location with no intentions of stopping in. However, I caught a glimpse of someone's hot dog and I couldn't resist. I doubled back and ended up ordering 3!When I first looked at the menu, I was a bit taken aback by the prices. The average price for a small hotdog is $12; despite this, I decided to still give it a try.When I received the food, the price made sense to me. The ""small"" was huge, the toppings were overflowing, the hotdogs were gorgeous, and most importantly, they were all very delicious. Though it's on the pricier end, in all fairness, this isn't your average hotdog. It's probably the most gourmet hotdog you'll ever come across.I ordered: ""The Eastwood"", which has Caramelized Onions, BBQ sauce, Cheddar, Monterey Jack Cheese and Bacon. I also got ""The Mac Attack"", which is topped with 4 cheese Mac, Green Onions and Bacon. And last but not least (actually - my fav), was ""The Boss"", which has Dr. Pepper Chilli, Onions, Coleslaw, Cheddar and Mustard. The menu items are creative. There were so many yummy combinations that I'd love to try soon. I'll definitely be returning to eat my way through their menu!"
/user_details?userid=kSz3wSUHilFrXuop8QnLZA,Elizabeth G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",5 star rating,The Mac and cheese here taste amazing! Probably one of the best I've had. However our plate looked a little different from some of the other Yelp pictures. Our poutine plate was completely smoothered in gravy so that's really all we tastes. We rarely got a taste of the other ingredients. Which is a shame because each had great flavor. Please don't let the gravy overpower all the other amazing flavors.
/user_details?userid=IWG4pVJxvm0QpiGb7cnsjg,Cody R.,"Canaan, CT",4 star rating,"Awesome spot with amazing poutine, had poutine with mac and cheese and popcorn chicken bites and it was drool worthy. Wish i had tried one of the dogs but will be back again. Extensive list of hot dogs/burgers and poutine as well. Go with an appetite because portions are deffintely good. The only complaint about this place was the service but considering how busy they were it was somewhat understandable, we sat for a solid 10 minutes before even getting a drink order, other than that no other complaints."

/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I was so excited to try Dirty Dogs' poutine for La Poutine Week! Their poutine consisted of Popcorn chicken + mac n cheese poutine - how can you go wrong? Truly comfort food at its best. While the service was veryyyyyy slow, that poutine was worth the visit.I also got to try someone else's order at the table; the beef hot dog topped with smoked meat with a side of classic poutine (a regular menu item). The smokey flavour of the hot dog was amazing and I loved the smoked meat. Their portion sizes are ridiculously big and the food is very satisfying. But a little overpriced in my opinion and the service is lacking."
/user_details?userid=xdOJERe7ToFUvd7CqY2LdQ,Lyle R.,"Pocatello, ID",5 star rating,I was walking around the downtown area and stumbled upon this place. Was pretty empty so I just sat at the bar. The bartender was very kind and made the experience enjoyable as he was much friendly than typical people you run into. Got some poutine and it was amazing. Portions were huge!
/user_details?userid=P8WKdwdpRZ4F1SMTLAL_nw,Ran N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"BEST place to get some vegetarian poutine in Montreal in my opinion. They have a ridiculous amount of vegetarian options compared to other places.The poutines themselves are perfect amount of cheese and gravy in fries. I fell in love. They give a huge portion all for under 10$. I got one by myself but I definately recommend sharing next time. The service was quick, we got our food in less than 10 minutes. The server that helped us was also very nice in helping us pick an option. Definately will return next time I'm in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=53DKgcqoIUU1ruPaWlna4Q,Lucas M.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"I go every once in a while to Dirty Dogs for their hot dogs, not something we eat back in Europe but here they take it to another level.Sometimes I just like the most simple ones you can find at chain restaurants for 2$, sometimes I want something real nice I can barely finish and I go to Dirty Dogs for that.They also serve Poutines, multiples variations of Mac & Cheese (I lived in the south of US so I looooove that too) and milkshakes/desserts you might wanna kill someone for.Price range between 15 to 25 bucks but worth it.I'd highly recommend you to try it, if you don't like it then you have a problem. (not saying this is crazy awesome tasty but how can you not like that place?)"
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Amazing service, food and prices ! My friend and I went to go check out this place. When we went in we found a cool diner feel. We sat at the bar as it was a bit busy. Probably being it was Saturday night. But a great choice as I love the bar. We ordered two green beers for St. Patty's Day also the Poutine topped with Mac and Cheese and also the Poutine topped with Philly Cheese Steak. The service was fast even though it was busy the food came out in under 20 minutes. The fellow behind the bar was very great at making sure we were good and topping of our water constantly. If you are a Poutine lover I'd suggest you check it out as they have a big selection of dishes. Something for everyone and also salads, burgers and hot dogs !!! Family friendly, close to the transit and parking on the street ! The prices are also amazing and I'm impressed by the venue and also prices on the menu !"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"The food tastes the same as the other location. It's still excellent so instead I'll review the service.I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was really empty even though we were there for 6pm ish. They were all very friendly! They explained the menu to is, not that we needed it but it was really appreciated. They also checked in with us a couple of times during the meal to see if we were ok.Monday to Friday they have a special 5-7 deal where some poutines/burger/hot dogs are 10$ and some cocktails/beers are 5$. So we got 2 poutines and 2 drinks. They don't have regular ice tea on the menu but the server offered to make me a homemade one that didn't have any alcohol in it. Service was also very fast, because they were empty I'm guessing, we ordered at 6:30 and for the food at 6:41. 11 minutes is not a long time to wait and the food was fresh and warm!I really like the way it is presented too, much more restaurant friendly. I will say the the poutine mac and cheese is not as fun as the hot dog mac and cheese. I LOVE mac and cheese and the taste was just a bit lost with the poutine gravy. It still tasted good but I wish they had a mac and cheese option!! It's so good there. Next time I'll try the burger :)"
/user_details?userid=DsFwvVBgQkfH4_yfzLa0Jw,Mykela M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Best late night drunk food! Came here after a night out in Montreal and was totally blown away. The food came out super quick and wasn't stale or cold. There were almost too many options but no complaints! There wasn't much open late and this was definitely a hidden gem. Would recommend coming here whether it be for lunch or for late night munchies. I got the soprano poutine, very flavorful and fresh. My friends got the Pig Mac dog and poutine and to be honest like the Pig Mac the most!"
/user_details?userid=cLzTKzunJpE7oVEFwTy9ug,Shruthi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"This place was actually really good. I tried a veggie dog here and it tasted nearly real, and the service was excellent. The only weird thing is that I ordered a ginger ale off the tap and it was flat and made me uneasy to drink. Other than that and the prices for the food that's my only complaint. They give you a huge portion of fries w your hotdog. If you make that smaller and decrease the prices, I'm sure more customers would leave here very happy."
/user_details?userid=theKAKaqiAGsLhpSyXBtSQ,Triston J.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I went here with my girlfriend, Ocea (insta: @oceaoceaocea). I ordered the poutine with the mac, large-style. It was really good! Super huge but I ate aall of it! Yum! Ocea on the other hand, was not a fan. - She said it tasted like she was at a fundraiser- She found the mustard overpowering- She thought the buns were of low quality and when she puts it like that I can totally see where she's coming from. I mean they did JUST remodel, they could afford to up the quality of the dogs and train their staff better in applying the condiments (our server was super friendly, so was the busser [it was his first day and he was doing really well] so just the staff that deals with the condiments) and get some new buns in there. She really dug the coconut bacon and she was happy with the amount of fries she received. I think when we take into consideration all of Ocea's comments Dirty Dogs gets about a 3. Thanks! :)"
/user_details?userid=GUtwJX8A1kODZnGqeBf-Ng,Erica R.,"Concord, NH",5 star rating,My boyfriend and I visited Montréal for the weekend and we spotted this place walking around. We sat at the bar and the bartenders Wilson and Paul were very friendly and informative about the menu it was my first time trying poutine since I live in the US and it was incredible!! Made with love and has the perfect amount of everything on it. We will definitely be coming back on our next trip.
/user_details?userid=5MUxvf75UwcBm3opJnljHQ,Karim H.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This place is as amazing as it is over the top. Excellent poutine with crazy add-ons. Portion sizes are insane. A large poutine could feed two easily. Ordered ""le pig mac"" - poutine with mac and cheese, onions, and pulled pork. Usually places that do over the top combinations like this are subpar and draw people in via the absurdity of their food. However, this place really puts the time into making quality food - their mac and cheese could have stood alone as its own dish, the pulled pork was incredibly tender, all with the comfort of a poutine at the bottom of this beast of a meal. Highly recommend this place after a night out of drinking, when you want a twist on the classic poutine, when you're down and want comfort food - basically any time! Big love to Dirty Dogs. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."

She was right. I got the vegetarian hot dog with the Eastwood (caramelized onions, cheddar and a BBQ sauce) and I ate it within 2 minutes. The bun is so soft and the vegetarian hot dog tasted perfect, with a slight amount of spice. The fries on the side were also heavenly.Love this place and can't wait to come back again!"

The flavours of the hot dog I ordered was interesting...I was expecting something different. There are a lot of options on the menu though so I'll give them that. I'm sure the other items are great but I wasn't completely satisfied with my order you can say...but I still ate it of course haha! Can't let food go to waste ;)

Open until 4:00 am so we decided to make a pitstop.Went inside at 3:00 am and the security guard told us it was take out only.Placed a take out order for poutine.Waited 30 minutes before the order was ready to go.Interacts with a few of the other Americans craving food after the bar. Overall, a little too pricey for fries, gravy, cheese, and meat as well as he wait time. We were the only ones to place an order so no back orders."

I had a burger with the pork on top with a salad to go ""low carb"".  Beyond delicious.  It carmelized onions on the burger/pork sandwich and the salad was amazing.  Simple, but really good. They have tons of poutine dishes also which I didn't try - but all looked spectacular.On top of the insanely yummy food, our server Jerry was SO nice!  He was attentive, funny, friendly and helpful.  I haven't had such friendly service like that in a long time.  It was just a wonderful experience.LOVE THIS PLACE and totally going back!"
/user_details?userid=-kkHPNvc4dxBHmYgHCNVfQ,Jax L.,"Boone, NC",1 star rating,"My suspicion when I first came across this place was that it was severely overpriced for a hot dog (a food that should, by tradition be cheap & delicious). Finally decided to give it a shot today, and not only was it severely overpriced for the quality, but the hot dogs themselves were just plain bad. I got the K Pop and there was more kimchi than anything else on the hot dog, and you couldn't taste anything else. The person I went with got the Pig Mac (hot dog with Mac and cheese on it), and the Mac and cheese was honestly disgusting. It tasted like cardboard. I don't really understand how you could fuck up hot dogs this badly and then make people pay 3 times more for them, but there ya go."
/user_details?userid=oqrkET25-S3LZK7OMuOUyg,Stefany P.,"Brossard, Canada",1 star rating,"I ordered the dirty Sanchez poutine which looks amazing. It was not cause it's topped with cheese sauce, the orange disgusting weird cheese flavoured liquid. Anyway when it got to my table I immediately told the waiter I did not want it and it didn't say it was topped with cheese sauce. He said it was but if you look at the menu it just says 4 cheese and no where does it mention a liquid weird orange cheese flavoured sauce. I though it would be like cheese curbs, with like shredded cheese of different kind. Anyway the waiter asked the manager who said he could only charge me 50% of it and I haven't even had a bite of it. And I could order something else, so basically I had to pay for half of it plus order something else. Anyway it costed me 30$ for one drink and one poutine that I haven't even eaten. Pretty disappointed. The hostess was really super nice."

We got there in couple of minutes and once we got there, we got our table and got the menus. Their menus are loaded with so many choices. However I decided to go for the Classic Poutine. The squad ordered mac and cheese and veggie dog. We waited for like 25 minutes for our order to get to our table as it was definitely the busiest time of the night where most people do want to have dirty dogs before they go home! It was also crowded.At first bite of the Poutine, I was in heaven! Their foods are so good. The taste and consistency for the gravy alongside with the cheese curds were exceptional. I finished it within a glimpse of time. Service was excellent, they make everything possible to end your night on a good note and with food. I'd definitely recommend it to others who want to try a ""Montreal Classic"" Loved it and will return to try other foods on their huge menus now that they started doing pizzas too which is so exciting for foodies like us all :)"

/user_details?userid=XgjdNvwD7rd8ieEHNNryDg,Alan B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Food is great. Love the fact that they have so many variations of poutines and burger/hotdog dishes. I'd be giving 4 stars if it was only based on the food and feel of the place, but they seemed to be really understaffed and quite unorganized with the orders during my visit. I had gone with a group and they had forgotten one of our orders which then turned into an hour wait for one dish. My friend had watched us all eat and finish our food by the time they told him that the food is about to be ready. If they get better service and organize themselves better it would be 5 stars from me."
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Honestly, it's a bit expensive for what you get. I've been twice, once for a hot dog and once for a burger.The hot dogs and burgers are good, there's a good amount of variety for what you can get in it. However, the cheapest things they have here are $13 (for a hot dog I think), which is quite expensive considering 80% of the plate is fries. It'll fill you up, but only cause you're eating a lot of fries (which aren't worth the price at all). The service is fine, nothing that stood out to me though. Nice location but the music can get a little loud at times!It's something you might think is worth trying just because it's been hyped up quite a bit, but keep in mind that you're paying around $20 (after tax+tip) for fries with a side of hot dog"

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I blame this one on my poor judgement. I should have picked a poutine, but instead got influenced by the restaurant's name and got a hot-dog (The Notorious P.I.G). The hot-dog was good for sure, but it was just one single fancier than average dog - not really worth the price tag. The rest of the plate was a swarm of fries, so it got kind of boring after awhile. Also, they used a sweet pickle on my hot-dog. A SWEET pickle - my worst nightmare!!! (I'm kidding, it's not that bad, I just like sour ones better). My borfriend went for the Mac & Cheese poutine, which was much more interesting and yummy. The Oreo milkshake we shared was quite nice too. It was served in those retro snack bar metal cups, and made entirely with thick, heavy vanilla ice cream. Chef on Call used to make their milkshake like that too, but have since opted for a lighter version, with mostly liquid milk it seems :( They had a lot of choices on their menu (porc, beef, vegetarian; hot-dog, burger, poutine) and the service was great. There's plenty of TV screens in Dirty Dogs, so it was possible to watch the ongoing hockey game from pretty up every seat. Nice place, but kind of expensive.Note: They have a very entertaining wall full of photos of celebrities (including Betty White lol) in the midst of eating hot dogs."

The fries were mediocre - needed salt or some sort of flavor. I should have gotten one of their specialty salads. Good place to grab a beer, eat a hot dog and chill on the patio while you people watch."

Their hotdogs are very good , lots of different combinations, love the homemade pork sausage.  The service is exacly how it should be, they're not overdoing it but they are efficient and nice. Oh and they have a great poutine too.Will definitely go again !"

If you want a hotdog go for the notorious PIG it's amazing! And for poutine the Mac attack! Waiter was very nice! It's a good place to eat out after 12am! Good music and not too many other people! Definitely one of my favourite places lately!

/user_details?userid=5JkrkzDxJ9U19dqY4_LQSg,Mike D.,"St-Leonard, Canada",3 star rating,"I had high hopes for this place long before trying it and I'm as to say I was a tad disappointed. Walking in unnoticed the diner feel to it, with celebs pictures all over the walls eating hot dogs, Superbad playing in the tv screens, very nostalgic to say the least that was a big plus! Now for the food.We took a few different hot dogs and some poutines, I took the nacho libre which had melted cheese sauce, crushed tortilla, sour cream, pico de gallo and green onion on a pork hot dog. The hotdog itself lacked taste, but the topping were great, the problem here is he bread, it gets to soggy and breaks, too much bread also, but i understand they need larger buns to support those huge combination. We also had Queb hotdog which was topped with smoke meat, also tasted okay but the actual hot dog didn't shine. We also too the poutine topped with Mac and cheese, this was delicious. At the end this place left me wanting more, if I return I would have to try the all beef hotdog, I'm glad I finally gave it a shot though."

Once we ordered the food came out pretty quickly.  I'm sure it helped that it was pretty early and wasn't very busy yet.  Everything was delicious.The only real downside is we went on a super hot and sunny day.  The windows were open, but it was super duper hot.  There were seats in the sunny open window we initially sat in, but quickly moved because the heat was just unbearable.  So next time around we'll pick a milder day."

Maybe get it to go."
/user_details?userid=PfOmz1JXEQXZgZ9r-Fvcsg,Jennifer K.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The service was very slow, the buns were stale and the staff were unfriendly from the beginning but the real piece de resistance was that the two staff members literally chased me and my friends out of the restaurant, banging on the windows and walking outside until one of my friends turned around to see if we had left something behind and the girl yelled at her and accused us of not tipping and calling us rude, when we indeed did tip (even though we shouldn't have) for three hotdogs, a fair amount in my opinion, but I won't be going back ever again because of the hostile environment and having the staff make me and my friends feel very uncomfortable when we are literally paying to sit there. Very disappointing."

/user_details?userid=kFXZgkzda79oYaMGfdcJsg,Caitlin V.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"WORST NIGHT EVER! I'm a good customer and always tip 20% but I was treated so bad tonight that I will NEVER go back. I have never been so talked down to and insulted in a public place. I asked about a special before ordering, but my bill was nearly twice what it should have been. I asked why and the waitress immediately sent her manager who accused me of lying, called me cheap and said the special never existed so maybe I should come when things are full price (I've ordered it many times) and said he'd have the waitress pay everything if I'd point at her (as though I wouldn't because I'm a liar). I didn't want someone to pay for my meal, just an apology would have been fine, so I asked to pay so I could end this whole scene in front of everyone. Then the waitress had the nerve to announce ""it's really sad that I have to pay for your meal"". I paid for my OWN MEAL. The attitude and complete disrespect did not deserve a tip. Horribly embarrassing and I will never go back."

We had heard good things and since I had never had true poutine before, we wanted to check it out. The menu can be a bit confusing, but we eventually figured it out. I got the Dirty Sanchez Dog with the traditional poutine. The curds were great and the gravy was spiced just right. My husband got the cheesesteak poutine and I must say, that was out of this world. Would definitely order that if we go back. Not too expensive either and they serve pretty decent beer and wine too."

Went in and waited to be seated. The service was very slow. When we sat down at our table it was FULL of water and the waiters didn't wipe it for us, leaving us to wait for it to dry. The decor of the restaurant was very cute, but beware of ""snap chatters"" taking many snapchats with their flash on while you're trying to eat. The food was okay, ordered the Mac attack but it seemed like the burger just has noodles in it with no cheese sauce. The dirty sanchez poutine was very good. The portion sizes were very big, but 2 beers, 2 burgers and 2 poutines it ran us $80 including tax and tip which was way over priced for the food serve"

(Meal pictured came up to 42cnd-had i known this, def would've picked stg different but apparently switching the regular fries for the poutine made the meal double the price.. sigh oh well) I asked for suggestions on stg spicy and cant remember the dish name but my beef hotdog came with the perfect amt of spice. I got a salad as a side and it was very fresh and the house made balsamic was great. Hubs enjoyed his dish as well. Overall recommend for the food but not for the price."

They were so nice and spoke perfect English. My waitress even gave me more recommendations for other bars in the area. The way the food works is you pick a hotdog hamburger or poutine and there are lots of different topping options. I got the pig Mac (pork and Mac and cheese) and my boyfriend got the queb (lots of meat). Both were super amazing. And again the waitress was very good at checking on us and bringing us more beer and a box. I highly recommend if you are on Rue St. Denis."

No one really greets you at the door and it took a few minutes before a waiter comes at the table. A little too expensive. My husband and I had burgers and the pig n mac poutine. The burgers are nothing special but the poutines are oh so good. The bbq sauce was really tasty and there was a hint of rosemary in the sauce. Overall i give it a 31/2 stars. This is a perfect place for a younger crowd after clubbing.
/user_details?userid=GxP5hy5t4aTOyIiO05jL1A,Victor T.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Decided to try out that new restaurant on the block. First and last time for me. Ordered the Bazooka: sausage ($15) served  in a big bun with bacon chips, and a HUGE serving of fries. Paradise for carb lovers. Ate a few fries and the sausage, left out the huge bun and  practically a whole plate of fries, which were good. Way too many carbs. Should have ordered a small salad to balance off the heavy fries. Not a satisfying meal at all:  $20.13 with a drink and taxes. Left hungrier than before. Hard to figure out why that place is so popular."
