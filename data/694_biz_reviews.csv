/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,"The inside joke is that I'm a bougie, expensive, and difficult woman to please. Let me get this straight: I can find pleasure, full satisfaction and appreciation towards any hidden gems in the city whether it's a $9.00 meal or a $300.00 meal. I don't care if it's at an upscale restaurant or someone's garage. Great food still remains great food.The thing that comes with a ridiculous hefty price is that it comes with a lot of expectations and I'm confident enough to say that some of you may have experienced a hefty bill while leaving with disappointment. We've all been there, and I can certainly relate.The amazing story about L'Entre-Pots is that @mtlpancakequeen was looking to build her database for pancakes and aiming to find the best ones in the city. Opened since 2011,  Alexandre Beaudry and his team not only excel in customer service (which we all know, something that I profoundly value) but also care about the sense of family amongst the staff members. L'Entre-Pots offers catering services, breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner- I mean pretty much whenever you're hungry. While the weather still allows it, they also have an extended terrace for those who want to enjoy their meal in the sun with a mimosa. While I also have been a guest during their popup and collaboration project, I can only consistently vouch for their brunch menu for at least the handful of time I've been there. Thank you to @mtlpancakequeen for introducing me this place- It had allowed me to showcase L'Entre-Pots talent to other followers and friends while hopefully creating more traffic to local businesses. While there is a ridiculous high demand for avocados for all you avocado basic bitches, I'm sure many of you have noticed the skyrocketing prices of these bad boys. I mean, if you do the groceries. But the price doesn't stop me from ordering the avocado toast at L'Entre-Pots. Served with salmon gravlax, feta cheese, dill yoghurt, and topped with a poached egg? This bad boy right here might be one of my many favourites on their menu.With their weekly specials, L'Entre-Pots is guaranteed to leave you full with their generous portions and excellent customer service.With the power of social media, which gems have you discovered?"
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My favorite brunch spot in the area. Super nice servers, quick service, great menu. All of their poached eggs dishes are great, and sometimes they have specials like blueberry pancakes with creme fraiche. I highly recommend the Bene Ole which is a breakfast poutine: poached egg, eggs benedict sauce, potatoes, pickles, bacon. It's huge and VERY tasty. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.They also have smoothies, your usual espresso selection like lattes, mimosas, and more.I highly recommend coming before noon. Around that time the place begins to become packed and it's a small spot. Seating is kind of smushed. I've seen groups of 6 before, 7 or more may be pushing it. They do take reservations I believe so maybe they'll accommodate you.Tip: ask for the orange hot sauce, they make their own and it's great on everything."

My friend was asking for sausage and the waiter explained they don't have there and showed us the back of his tee shirt which says ""no sausage"" in French LOL.The food is good (7 out of 10). I had a fried chicken salad with naan. I like the combination of ingredients in this dish. It's tasty, it's a bit over seasoning. The dish was too salty for me. This happened to the full breakfast my friend ordered as well, too salty. I didn't try the fruit juice but apparently it's really popular. The place is small and always packed with people in the morning. It's better to come around noon."

We were fortunate to try most of the items on the menu for brunch. The mimosas are great.  A lot of the items used similar ingredients and flavors-so nothing stood out on its own. The Mediterranean fried chicken served on naan bread with a pickled slaw was probably my favorite dish, if I had to pick one dish. Overall, great vibes."
/user_details?userid=raqTx1Tj-wTMs25mcDPMxQ,Monica M.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Cool place with neighbor(ly) feel. Cute terasse in the summertime. Portions are huge! Coffee is good but not amazing. The bene ole plate is so much food. Overall pretty good food & good prices. Enjoy!
/user_details?userid=oDS8X_7e9vxIgy3VkvH65g,Mayra M.,"Woodland Park, NJ",5 star rating,"Wandered upon this place on a Saturday morning. We were able to sit within 5 minutes in the terrace and ALL THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Our server( didn't get her name, she had space buns) was so good. Very attentive, talkative and patient. The entire menu is in French and she translated it to us. I ordered the avocado toast and green juice (to die for). 5 out of 5 stars. Be prepared to wait some time as there was a good amount of people waiting outside. Try it out when here."

/user_details?userid=nfhwbjQUYJbJxpvo1sBcRQ,Hannah Elizabeth B.,"Morrisville, NC",5 star rating,"We visited this brunch spot on our honeymoon. They were welcoming and had great service, and were just starting to get busy when we arrived at 10:30am. We can only read French, but they were accommodating and spoke English to us (but no English menus). The food was delicious and creative. They have vegetarian and varied meat options. Our food came out quickly and we enjoyed it very much."

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Recently had the chance to try out this cozy resto located on rue Masson with our foodie group of friends and we loved it!! Truly a great treasure find! The resto itself is quite small but they can accomodate a group of max 8 with reservations of course!  Reservations are highly recommended as this place is very popular with good reason!  The service was really great..very well organized and super friendly! They have a few seatings for brunch on the weekend but they give you plenty of time to enjoy your meal and you don't feel rushed at all!  Our reservation was at 10:45 and we had our table until 12:30pm.  Now for the dishes..simply delicious mouth-watering food! The coffee and latte's were awesome and they refill freely which is great! We tried the egg's benedict with jambon and egg's benedict with salmon....awesome!  The hollandaise sauce was perfect!  Everything was tasty including their potatoes and their naan chicken salad. We also tried their pancakes which were yummy and perfect for sweet lovers! I would definately recommend this place for breakfast/brunch ...great guality food and not expensive at all! Will definately go back to try their other dishes!
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Please reserve a table because the place can get packed quite easily! It's an excellent restaurant that serve great breakfast and lunch that serves incredibly big portions of food, for example, I tried their Bene Ole, which consists of potato, lardon, cheese, caramelized onion and so on, it was enough for me to eat for two meals! My friend tried their avocado toast, which was really gigantic! Literally a mountain of avocado, so avo lovers go for it! The service was good and the price is very fair. The restaurant offers a regular menu and a special menu of the day, so there are different interesting options. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So many options for brunch on Laurier Est and somehow i find myself returning to this little place again and again-- whether you want a big fat brunch after a night of party or a healthy vegan choice with the freshest ingredient, this place never disappoints! Try the naam with fried chicken and spiced salad or the avocado toast with gravlax if you want some veggie. Try the gros bill if you want good ROI for your belly (real thick pieces of ham & high-quality cheese included!). Arrive early or make a reservation on weekends."
/user_details?userid=7eHfZUHxun1Al3W2lEAc1g,Alex N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic little (literally tiny) spot! The coffee (I had a latte) is nothing special but the food was delicious. All plates are beautifully presented and well priced for the quality!. The portions are huge! The staff was friendly - a bunch of young girls working last weekend - however my only ""negative"" comment is that they spent most of the hour and a half we were there chit chatting and also talking to a group of their friends who stopped by, therefore not paying much attention to clients. Nonetheless, will definitely be going back to try some of the many brunch options we didn't get the chance to try."
/user_details?userid=zWheJVDqF4E92ZE2kiUV9w,Joaquín S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is really good and they usually bring it to you really quick.They have pretty creative brunch food. The breakfast sandwich and the fries chicken are pretty amazing. Their Gros Bill sandwich is good but because it has some pâté on top you have to eat it with knife and fork (c'mon guys, it's a sandwich).Coffee it's not included with the food, which is kind of bad considering it's a brunch spot"
/user_details?userid=-kkHPNvc4dxBHmYgHCNVfQ,Jax L.,"Boone, NC",5 star rating,"Had a delicious brunch here. Ordered the French toast with bacon and eggs and potatoes & it was delightful! A little hot on the balcony, but worth the heat for such a good meal."

/user_details?userid=Rnc2AWf-Af1rjV6FHd2xPA,Hatchy M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very pleased with this new brunch discovery. Came on Canada Day so the place was packed and we waited a while for food but the staff was super friendly and warned us there would be a longer than usual delay on the noms. They even brought us some freebie yogurts for our patience which is always a nice touch. French toast with bacon cheddar and fried egg was amazing as was the egg white scramble. Highly recommend for lovers of brunchness.
/user_details?userid=IHdKUpqSLhk2XaXiOAtaJw,Adam K.,"Baltimore, MD",3 star rating,"Not bad. Came for a little brunch. The Nutella french toast was pretty tasty, and I enjoyed some grilled sourdough bread with some house jams. A little pricey for what it was, but the place is charming (looks like you've stepped into Brooklyn) and next time I'm in town, I'll have to try some of the other options."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious breakfast. Excellent, friendly and prompt service with smiles all around despite it being a busy Sunday brunch. I looooove that they put pickles in their breakfast sandwich, it was absolutely decadent and delicious and I am craving it again as I type. The mushroom and walnut toast was also fantastic, seemingly simmered in a lively wine sauce on crusty, thick bread. Their drinks (we he lattes) are amazing and they even have peanut butter and jam cookies that rock! I will definitely be back and be trying everything else on the menu, there's no doubt about it."
/user_details?userid=qdXb73WW5ky0NHjxoPN-qw,Sam S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,We have tried a lot of places and this is the Best breakfast place in Montreal in our opinion. Great original food in a relaxed non-pretentious ambiance. love this place!

/user_details?userid=RE5qSIAdrFLc27-N9ndzJA,Joanna K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Decadent menu options and the service was lovely despite a packed house and one waiter. The plates coming out of the kitchen are gorgeous and tasty af. Thick slices of homemade bread and perfectly crisped potatoes. Good coffee too. Came for breakfast and kinda want to stay for lunch....
/user_details?userid=2Nfrg9FeYp2IB-w1XCMjTg,Danny F.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,I've been looking for a foodie's dream place and I believe this is it. They make fresh bread and integrate various influences into there creations. I went there and got a pizza with proshuto  goat cheese and dandelion leafs! What I love about l'entre-pots is it's one of theses places where you can go to hang out on a Friday after work or grab a pastry for breakfast and every time you pallet will go for a ride.
