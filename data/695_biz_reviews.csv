I say certified but I don't think there's any korean food certification, the owners are korean so it's fair to let them have that.For real though, this place is good and you should definitely be on your list of places to visit if you ever crave for korean food on Saint-Denis near Berri UQAM. The prices are good and the portions are top notch. I had the kimchi fried rice with some korean chicken nuggets. While I had hoped for a crispier chicken like those korean fried chicken, they were still delicious. As for the fried rice, I only have positive stuff to say about it. Hope they get throught this whole pandemic because I am coming back here for sure."

We had tofu soup, bibimbap, and tteokbokki. Everything was delicious, well priced, and well portioned. I'll order again soon!"
