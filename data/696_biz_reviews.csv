The space and menu is well prepared for events and family dinners. The menu had many options which catered to family style meals. We were a small group so we chose to try out a few of their appetizers which were sized on the larger end of the spectrum. We had chicharron that were crispy and succulent. Are pas that accompanied the beans and tasty grill fired chicken. What was beyond at this place was the hospitality. The woman who served us was warm and generous. She was patient too since I was trying to a speak my broken Spanish with her and the other man serving us. They both were encouraging in the endeavour. I would definitely recommend this spot for groups.

There were mixed reviews from the gang. Salmon was dry. The mixed plate was ok. Different meats with rice and beans. The paella was good with plenty of flavourful rice. Some hits and some misses. They had live music which was nice but we just wanted to talk. Not there fault. Portions were large with many people taking leftovers home. For a fun Cuban experience, good place to go. Food wise have the paella. Viva Cuba !!!!"
