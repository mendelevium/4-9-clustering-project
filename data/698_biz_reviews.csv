I've been back a couple times since then and everything is exactly the same and just as great. The gravy is thick and flavorful, and they use mozzarella for the poutine instead of cheese curds. I though this was a huge faux pas, but it was delicious. The all dressed pizza is one of the best pizzas I've had in Montreal. Their subs are also very good. It's a local, not pretentious restaurant that focuses on delivering good food. I do not live in the area anymore, but anytime we are in Outremont this is where we go to eat."

Based upon other reviews, I felt that this place needed to be checked off my bucket list. In terms of my yardstick for Greek style thick and juicy crust loaded with tons of cheese, I'm used to B&M which always does a pretty good job. Based upon the reputation and pedigree of this restaurant, I had high expectations.The pizza arrived quickly and upon opening the box, I had a huge smile on my face. It's been a long time since I laid eyes on such a good looking pie. The crust looked thick and doughy, the generous toppings (I ordered a meat lovers with extra pineapple...that's how I roll) were bursting out of a pool of perfectly browned mozzarella.Never has the look of a food been so misleading. The taste of this pizza had virtually no redeeming qualities. BTW....I was STARVING! The cardboard box might have tasted good given my hunger. Unfortunately the cheese was absolutely tasteless. How does one go about sourcing mozzarella made without any salt? Is the even a thing? The toppings also had no taste at all. The pepperoni was completely bland. The pineapples were tart instead of sweet. Finally, the crust was simply ridiculous. They give you the option between thick and thin crust. My definition of thin is near razor thin crispy pizza. There's nothing wrong with that, but I was in the mood for a regular pizza so I selected thick. Big Mistake. This was the thickest and most tasteless crust I've ever tried. Imagine the disappointment of getting through all the tasteless toppings and cheese just to land on crust that is neither salty nor sweet. There is no airiness to the crust. It is simply a solid tasteless mass of wasted opportunity. On Super Bowl Sunday, this pizza broke my heart like Fredo in Godfather II. I got through one slice and tried in vain to start a second before tossing the whole disaster in the garbage in a moment of resignation and dejection. Khalid S.'s review from November 28th 2016 is spot on. I will not be eating here again."

The interior is unassuming and simple, but the food is top notch! Delicious pizza, surprising poutine. And.... Amazing steak submarine! Absolutely delicious with fried onions and other goods. What can't this pizzeria do?!Get the 14 inch steak sub! Great price too!"

I think they are a cornerstone in my experience of living in Outramont and the best Pizzeria in the hood. Like Garfield I hate Mondays, and like Garfield, lasagna (in this case Van Horne Pizzeria pizza) makes it all better."
/user_details?userid=1E6UamutcdTmvu6AGdksLA,Jenn S.,"Halifax, Canada",4 star rating,"I love Van Horne Pizzeria; every single time I've gone there or ordered from them, it has been nothing less that an awesome experience. The actual shop isn't anything fancy, but their pizza is fantastic. The workers there are always extremely friendly and helpful, as well as being both French and English speaking. Delivery is free, service is great. The pizza isn't the best I've had, but it is the best I've had in Montreal for the price! The only downside would be they're not open super late, so make sure to order before 10 or so."
