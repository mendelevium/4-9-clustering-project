/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,It looked like crap from the outside but don't let it fool you. We went during happy hour and ended up getting pretty drunk :P The beer selection and the food were excellent.The jumbo chicken wings are really huge. We tried both the kick ass (way too spicy for me) and the cider bbq (amazingly sweet and tangy). 1 place was enough for 2 people. As well as the deep fried cheese curds. Everything was so tasty. Prices are very reasonable. It took a while to get served but after that everything came fast. I love the kilts.
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",3 star rating,"It's always too quiet when we go. It's not a dive, but it kinda feels like one 'cuz of the lack of ppl most times.Set up a bit strange too (on the narrow with weird sections of tables) but ok.Food is good, decent pricing for bar eats. My brekkie I ordered last time, just plain ol bacon and eggs, was cooked to perfection exactly how I asked for it. Service is great and friendly and sweet. However unfortunately the last time we were there they would not put the sound on for Alouettes playoff game! The Alouettes make it to the playoffs once or twice a freaking decade and they were sweet to at least put the game ON for us, but no sound for a playoff game blows! We were told if the majority of patrons asked for the sound on then she could, but that otherwise she would get in trouble from the manager who was watching the cameras. At one point only us (a table of 4) and 1 other dude all watching the game asked and she said she texted the manager to see if it was ok, but sound was never put on. Even after a couple more tables arrived and clearly were watching the game too, but still no sound, so by halftime we decided to leave to find a better spot watch the game.I like the spot n' the concept, there's just not a very good party vibe goin on here unfortunately."

Solid overall.Note however Ye Olde is not a sports bar (which is fine), volume was not available for the Al's game, which is only reason we left."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a really solid Montreal pub. It seems to have gotten bigger since the last time I was here. (or maybe, my memory is failing me given this is a place to park yourself and down multiple pints of beer)I ordered some wings with their kick-ass sauce as well as some extra honey garlic sauce on the side. This was a good call. Because the kick ass sauce is listed as the spiciest option, I was expecting more pain than flavour. I was happy that this wasn't the case. The sauce has a great bite that will get you releasing those happy endorphins, but the pain doesn't linger long and is washed down easily with a sip of beer. Add the requisite blue cheese dressing with the huge carrots and celery, and this is one of the better plates of wings in the city. They are large, juicy, and very lightly fried. I then had the bacon and blue cheese burger which was substantial and satisfying. The burger won't win any awards, but for a downtown pub, it's solid and pairs really well with a good pint of lager. Service was extremely efficient despite the place being packed right before a Habs game. Next time, I've got to try the curry sauce poutine which I saw the guy next to me eating. It looked f%@$ing massive and delicious."

And no.. this is not a mommy brain issue here lol!I've been a couple times BACK THEN.. on the location in monkland! However this is my first time at this place.. we originally came here for paint night! The place is fairly big and the staff is so nice and friendly! I love their uniforms and how authentic this place is. We were able to order food and drinks through out the paint night event which was so cool! The service was really great! We started off with the basics of gin seven and then switched over to apple cider beer! I'm new to this world of beers so is it just cider?! Not sure! Anyways it was DELICIOUS!!!  Then we ordered WINGS! .. where have they been my entire life?! They were just perfect and crispy.. at this point I didn't even care what the hell i was painting i just wanted all the wings in the world from this place! I am definitely coming back for more cider & wings!!!
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Not my favourite location.Came for a 5 a 7 and of course to chow down on some wings. We split a plate of a few of them they were meaty and cooked really well. You can pick to have your sauce on the side or the wings tossed in sauce. Burger is very big and hearty which was alright but the fries were half cooked and thrown in with older ones which was terrible I couldn't eat them poubelle.Service was great really nice girl kept coming by every time our beers were done.Beer... they have no pitchers for 5 a 7 boooo! And the beers they do have $5 are meh. For $6 you can get a shocktop wayyy better.Nice place nice staff but beers were meh and the french fries were terrible and we later discovered that after eating here we were both sick as it's the only thing we ate that day.Would come back but just for drinks and wings.

I like that it's in a basement on De La Montagne street, away from the hustle of Bishop and Crescent bars.During one of my recent visits, I discovered that one of their chefs is Sri Lankan and they therefore make really flavourful (and somewhat spicy) food like curries and chicken tikka. Their service is friendly and efficient, and love the fact that the guys wear kilts!I was there last Friday night with a large group for game night (we were 10). We got a good corner at the back of the pub at 6pm and good thing we did because this place gets really crowded and loud on a Friday.Some of us ordered dinner; I got the chicken tikka wrap, which is served with fries (average) and a curry carrot soup (spicy and delicious). The chicken tikka was so flavourful, really enjoyed my meal. They have a happy hour from 4-7pm so we were able to take advantage of the good prices on beer and cider. Had a blast and would go back!"

Live entertainment every Sunday but tonight was Super Bowl night. Great space, Vibe was electric and the servers were wearing kilts.. Whoo Hooo! I definitely  ordered the spicy chicken wings which were freakin' delish. Onion soup was also inviting and comforting on a cold dreary evening. No matter what you choose from the menu it's all good. In the end the team I was rooting lost to the Great Tom Brady....once again ."

/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here for a happy hour on a Wednesday and it was realllllllly empty. We got a pretty good corner table though so sweet! My boyfriend and I only came in to grab an entree and a drink before heading out to do some errands but the food was so good and the service so pleasant that we stayed all evening.I initially ordered the Caesar salad as an entree and my boyfriend got the onion rings. I enjoyed my salad a lot, it was creamy and crunchy. I didn't like the croutons though but you can just skip those and just eat the salad. The onion rings were good too but I felt they were too soft, I like onion rings really crispy. My boyfriend doesn't so he loved them. He ordered another batch and we got the pound of chicken wings to share and replaced the fries with a side of salad (I wanted more!). We got the wings with the honey garlic sauce. They weren't too spicy but they were a bit too sour for me which was weird. The chicken was really good though so I just scrapped off the sauce. I really liked it here, prices were very decent and the server that we had was so nice! I had a great time here and I know I would come again!The beer for happy hour was 6$ for a pint I believe. The salad as an entree is 6$, onion rings 7$, pound of chicken wings 18$."

Having said that, we liked it quite a bit actually. The service was exceptional. We were greeted by the bar tender who told us we could sit anywhere we liked. The may be closing shortly so he was the only one attending people but was super swift in getting all the orders in! We grabbed a few long islands and they were made amazingly! We loved them. This is one of those pubs wherein people would love to come all the time (your neighborhood go-to-pub). It had a good energetic vibe which we loved even though it was empty that night. Definitely coming here again to grab a bite and staying longer next time! I recommend this to friends who are spending time in Montreal and want to go to a pub."

On Saint Patrick day about 11pm we decided to have dinner and a beer in an Irish  bar! There wad a line at the entrance. It was terribly cold outside. We were told it takes an hour to get a table for six. Almost disappointed, few minutes later, just when we were leaving, the guy called us in and saidhe has a table for us. Guess what, there were many free tablesWhether the guy was joking or not we had a lot of fin. A pint of Guinness, beef pie with mashed potato and great company. What else do you need?!I recommend the place, but insist to get in if you were told the bar is full"

Love coming here for happy hour and they still got that going nicely with a healthy selection of beer on tap. Pub food is of the traditional fare with a side menu which is Tamil based as per the origin of their chefs. For what it is, it's pretty decent.Our waiter was rushed all night long since the place was paaaaacked but still managed to do a very good job. Food was provided after a reasonable delay. Drinks came quickly.This is a great place to kick back and have a few beers."

Food is amazing, and they have an eclectic mix from your traditional pub food, huge helpings of poutine, to pasta dishes and salads. Staff are very friendly and dressed to the nines. Also, drink prices are super reasonable. You can get imperial pints of beer for just a few dollars. Can definitely get a bit loud on game nights, but would definitely return for more poutine. They can accommodate large groups if you have a party or celebration, plenty of tabling in the back."

/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,Being hungry before a hockey game we found this place.  So why not give it a try  their onion soup was awesome. I was surprised for a bar. I had the chicken. And i tried the burger from my daughters dish. All good. Portions were big. So unable to finish the dish.
/user_details?userid=hGBbaS3PUlWKGk2wR_qn2A,Bonna J.,"Mineville, NY",4 star rating,My boyfriend and I chose this place over a fancy restaurant. We were greeted at the door with great hospitality. We got seated and it was very busy but the gentleman got our order. I asked to sub the fries for rice and he got me fries instead or he must've not heard me. I got strip steak but it was very chewy. Overall this place was great! My boyfriend enjoyed his 10 oz steak. The best part was sharing his 10 oz steak.

/user_details?userid=pQYvYtmudcf2iWaDv67CWg,Katrina L.,"Edison, NJ",4 star rating,"My friends and I took a weekend trip up to Montreal from New Jersey and were staying on Sainte-Famille. This place was not a long walk from our place and was near the main Saint-Laurent. Upon entering, the place looked dark and loud since there was a live band playing that Saturday night. However, we were seated in the back dining area and the noise level was not too much where you couldn't converse with friends, but appropriate for a pub. This was a plus for me! The ambiance was warm and inviting with the faux - stone walls, wood tables, and Christmas lights. There were tvs set up for those who would like to watch some sports. Their beer list wasn't too bad and the prices were pretty sweet, compared to the drink prices we're used to in the NJ/NY area. I started off with the cream of turkey soup and it was delicious. I ordered the chicken Tikka wrap but it was pretty bland and lacked that masala taste I was looking forward to in the dish. The fries that came with the dish were way too greasy, but I guess it went well with the beer. My friends ordered the burgers and said they were pretty good. The staff was friendly and very attentive. The place is pretty good hangout place if you're looking to eat, drink, and hang out."

The pub was not crowded at all and had an inviting atmosphere. The lighting was a bit dark, especially if at a corner table. I ordered a burger with fries, and my friends ordered chicken tenders and the chicken sandwich. They said their meals were solid but nothing special. I agree, as my burger was good but nothing out of this world. The fries were classic pub fries and were nothing to write home about. The service was fast and the waitress was really charming. Overall, this is a good place for a casual meal with friends. Probably will try somewhere else next time I'm in Montreal, but don't regret coming here."

And the ambience is casual. They play music, but at a reasonable volume. Hence, you can hear each other talk without shouting.For a bar, I would rate their food to be very good. Especially their naan pizza. The place is affordable and busy on weekends. They sometimes have live music if you stay tuned to their bulletin board, you would know when."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place to come for a Habs game. I ventured out one of our crazy winter storms and was pleasantly surprised to see the place around half full. YOO has a great Habs game night deal. For $30 you get two pints of their house lager, wings and nachos. For $15 you get one pint and wings. We went with two rounds of the $30 deal. They also have game night draws when you buy beer for some grand prizes and even did a draw for tickets for the next home game. Decor of the place is like an older basement pub but for guys who want beer nachos and a hockey game on the tube it's fine. The pub does have a fairly large beer selection and of course tasty pub grub. For sporting events on a guys night out what else could you ask for? There are other options downtown but YOO does the job just dandy."

Our very first stop at a bar in Montreal was this NHL-friendly pub, and it did not disappoint. Although it was not super busy the first time we came (it was a Tuesday night) we were able to watch the Rangers/Tampa game over our first ever plate of Canadian poutine and it was delicious! Every employee was super friendly and attentive to everything. The second time around was a Friday night, game 7 of the same series. Although it was packed, again, our server was very friendly and quick when it came to our food and drinks, along with every shot we took when a goal was scored. Awesome atmosphere, delicious foods, and incredible service are the reason we came back a second time, and will come back again next time we visit Montreal!!"

I was invited by work colleagues to meet at Ye Olde Orchard for a work shindig/event and enjoy their trivia night. I show up, and take place at a table reserved specifically for the occasion. The waitress doesn't greet me at all, but asks me if I'm there with the work party, I am, but then she ushers me to another table.. I brush it off and happily dive into our trivia night. It's all going well, when about 2 hours in, our waitress must have realized she was missing out on tips, so she circles our tables asking us to order.. We were all taken aback, since usually when we have rented spaces for events, they would be the ones offering us food, in exchange for plugs, ad space etc. We get ready to order, but nonono, she demands one order per patron. I had a $5 bill on me and that was it, so I ordered their Cream Ale (excellent drink selection, yo!). She was unusually pushy towards my Guinness-drinking buddy, which didn't go down well at our table. After 5 solid trivia hours, I decided to make my way home, but was stopped by our waitress again, ""is $5 your final order?"". Yes, I give tips for good service, not the way you wear that short plaid skirt. Meh."

/user_details?userid=AJcsXxYLxFQe_4pPHFr-ag,Laura B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Love this pub! Go to school right next door. Will never be back because of the extremely rude Irish bartender with the spiky hair. I am a bartender in an Irish pub and know what to expect from service when a pub is in a bit of a rush. Being talked down to by a person whose bar is fully empty for asking for a round of shots is not my idea of good service. This guy does not deserve to call himself a bartender. Perhaps he is more suited to serve soft drinks at McDonalds.

Nice cheap house beWe ordered the sausage naan pizza and it was much better than expected. I got the French onion soup which was also good and my husband got a meat dip sandwich? Which he enjoyed.

/user_details?userid=dcmoGS0eQpjkgD9cgSEgsw,Jeff S.,"Westmont, IL",3 star rating,"I was looking for a slightly more economical place for dinner, in the vicinity of the Marriott, and happened to come across this place, also a very short walk from the stadium where the Canadiens were playing the first game of the conference finals. Don't let the name fool you. The food is traditional pub fare, but the atmosphere is definitely early-twenties. They have large screens conveniently placed so that you can catch a game from literally any seat, which was nice, but during commercials, they jacked up the rap music, which was highly annoying.It's pretty clean, and wide enough to navigate in. After waiting a little bit to get noticed, I just grabbed the table closest to the door. Service was so-so, they're nice enough, but when my beer's gone, I shouldn't have to send up a flare for another one, and while they had a decent crowd during the game, they weren't overwhelmed by any means. It's okay when your staff schmoozes with the clientele, but it shouldn't be at the expense of other, thirsty customers. I chose to eat inside to watch the game and get away from all the obnoxious cigarette hounds outside (they have tables on the curb, like a lot of Montreal joints).I had the Cajun salmon. Their definition of ""cajun"" means blackened to the point of being dry, with just the slightest hint of spice, but not terrible. The rice was completely tasteless, but luckily it came with grilled peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The salad was a pain in the ass, large and leafy and stuffed into a small bowl. Almost impossible to eat without it spilling onto the table. But overall the food was probably the best pub food I had of all the places I've hit in the last few weeks.Since it's a lower-priced place in an otherwise expensive area, I guess you get what you pay for. Their whiskey list is impressive, but given the tiny shots they serve, not worth it. Their ""trufflicious"" cake was, well, just chocolate cake. Overall, it wasn't bad for the price, but it's not a place to impress a date with the food or atmosphere. I will say, it was good enough that I will give it a second shot next time in town."

If you're after wings, beer, and maybe some sport, you won't go wrong here.The wings here are great. The 'kick-ass' spicy aren't too hot (for me, but then again I am VERY manly...), but just hot enough. They also come with sweet potato fries, which is cool. Some of my mates tried the curry here, and said it was really good - the menu has a lot of  Sri Lankan dishes (I think the kitchen staff are  Sri Lankan), and I've heard good things about them. The first place we sat down was a bit smelly, but they reseated us when we asked (watch out for the both near the toilets!) so it wasn't a big deal in the end.There's a few screens around the place so you can definitely see whatever main sporting event is on (eg. hockey), but they're not huge/everywhere so I'd probably go somewhere else if that was my main focus.We got there early (5pm) on a Thursday and there was plenty of room, but it did fill up after everyone got off work.I was going to give this place three stars, but the the waitresses wear kilts, so it gets an extra star. WATCH OUT: the waiters also wear kilts, so if you're going to check the staff out, make sure you're checking out the right ones..."
/user_details?userid=Ayc5Ti5tS9akIwvdmoaDBQ,Serge D.,"Yonkers, NY",2 star rating,"Not a good pub. Went here on a Thursday evening to get dinner. ended up getting a black and tan that the waitress poured wrong (It was more like a shit brown tan) and when I was like ""ummm, this is just a ""tan"", she scoffed at me and than refused to give me any service or attention for the rest of my time in the bar, even going as far as to just nod at me when I pointed towards her and raised my empty glass (after trying to get her attention five previous times). I had to flag down a bus boy to place a food order. The servers also wear kilts like outfits that look dumb. Being a gentleman who has worked in the service industry before, I still left a 15% tip. should have left 5%.If you want a good bar go to GRUMPYS, it is the best. If you want a good straight forward pub, head to McKibbins or if you must, Irish Embassy. This quarter Irishman would rather support an establishment that espouses Celtic pride rather than an ENGLISH colonialist establishment any day. Vive l'irlande, nique la reine!"
/user_details?userid=KdZlltBnpXERUb6vxEdYKg,Frederick R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Good wings and they have a good variety of styles/flavours. The service from the waitresses could be better. We waited a long time to even get our order taken. I would have also liked some refills but we were only checked on once early on into our meal. I would go back for beers and wings.

/user_details?userid=AbLMLvpb2gKYKPKwjXnLRA,Nat H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Okay drinks, but what's up with the service? We gave a five dollar tip for a couple of drinks (what amounted to be a 25% tip), and the waitress made a very angry, displeased face at us and wouldn't leave until we gave her more money. My boyfriend threw in a toonie on top of our $5 and she just frowned, snatched it, and left without saying a customary ""thank you"" or ""have a nice night."" This bar is nice, generally quiet, and is an overall fine Irish pub - but as someone who used to be a waitress myself, this was beyond unprofessional. I would never have acted this way towards a customer. Ever. Beware - this is a great bar if you want to give generally slow and uninvolved staff a 40%+ tip so they don't lash out at you. Otherwise, it's just ho hum."

Most of the staff there have for sure irish blood in their vein. There is good beer (a good variety), good food, good music and a very festive mood!  But most of all for me the cherry on top of the sunday was the amount of screens showing ice hockey games lol. Since I'm a big fan of ice hockey, this bar offers me all I can dream of. Next time you're in Montreal give it a try!"
/user_details?userid=loM3MiLUhGKzkx05gh5aZg,Mike M.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Saturday night, downtown Montreal, 2 and a half hours before Leafs vs Habs.  Ye Olde Orchard Pub had a great atmosphere and was lively with a mixed crowd of fans from both teams. Easily found within a couple of blocks of The Bell Center (le centre Bell).  The three guys in our group were seated without delay and beverages were ordered and delivered within 5 minutes of our arrival. Wait staff was knowledgeable about bar menu items and spoke French and English with ease as 2 of us at the table were not bilingual.  A very good assortment of beers available, both bottled and on tap. Wait staff was able to answer questions about varieties inlc local, domestic and imports. The selection was good.  Food order followed shortly after our bevies arrived. Food menu was impressive with a wide assortment of pub foods and classic restaraunt options - all were reasonably priced.  Our group ordered burgers and BLT's accompanied by poutine.  My menu selection also came with choice of soup or salad and I opted for French onion soup, which was thick and brothy and very tasty.  All menu choices we chose were very good. We all exchanged comments and everyone seemed happy with their choice.  One of the other guys picked up the tab, so I'm not sure what the final tally was, but nothing on the menu struck me as over-priced.  I would say 3 guys with a beverage each plus pub fare and tip was probably around $80.00-$90.00. Overall a great experience at a good price. If you're disappointed with your experience at this place, you're probably the fussy type or you unfortunately experienced a server at a good pub who was having a bad night."

The service is fast and friendly and the food is reasonably priced, good portions and very tasty. I had the regular hamburger the last time I was there but the jerk chicken over coconut rice looked amazing good."

The service is fast, and thru have decent hot wings (although their 'burn your face off sauce' could bs a tad bit spicier). The food, however, is surprisingly good! Upon entry, we were seated and served by the manager, which was the best part of the experience (very fun guy, lots of great jokes!). Their drinks are just great (no complaints if your 'well' rum is Havana Club!)"

The host is funny and (almost more importantly) efficient. He also gets creative with the format of questions too. Really good service overall. Get the $5 beer on tap and the naan pizza.

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is definitely my preferred Ye Olde Orchard location (although the one on Prince Arthur is a close second).  It's quite large and unless there's a game or something at the Bell Centre it isn't too packed.  The food for the most part is pretty good too.
/user_details?userid=CmG7H7BTZ_G_nv-DwyEbnw,May N.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"We had walked from Vieux Montreal looking for a good happy hour and this is the first one we found, but it was a good one - all microbrew pints $5 CND. It was a Monday night so the prices were good all night and they had pub trivia. We enjoyed our first pints - mine was the apricot and fruity, but good enough for me, not a beer connoisseur. The place was very quiet when we arrived, but filled up quickly as we drank. Then we got hungry, so I tried their hamburger steak well done while he tried their veggie burger. My steak was not that great, fries were good, and I had a some plain baked green beans and carrots. My partner noted the veggie burger was heavy on the onion. The place cleared up just as quickly as it had filled by the usual end of happy hour. We didn't stay for the pub quiz, unfortunately. He worried it was going to be full on Canadian trivia; I felt, who cares? Service was ok - one waitress for what felt like the whole bar. Accepts credit cards. Good place to enjoy a drink."

Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office."
/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I get why people would put a 4 stars. Somehow, me 3 years ago would have probably put a 5 stars. It's a 3.5 star in my humble opinion. Simply put, I've been to a very large amount of irish pub and at the end of the day, it's confy, food is better then lot of bars and service is great. Plus the music once in a while is always great. What's not great about this pub and all Irish pub in Downtown Montreal in general: a pint is 7.75 to 8.50$ + a 1$ tip (less than that, you're cheap! Ye Olde Orchard has great food. had a large burger for 10-12$ and pints of beer there and there. Service was fast and seating was well arranged. Let's just say there' was place if you wanted to party and listen to the music, and place to sit, eat and talk without that much noise.Je comprends pourquoi les gens veulent sortir dans un pub. C'est confortable. Des banquettes, de la musique chaleureuse, la game des habs sur les écrans de télé, de la bouffe de bar de bonne qualités! Mais, quand t'en a fait un, tu les as pas mal tous fait. C'est une belle place pour manger pas cher et boire de la bière. Par contre, c'est toujours cher la bière; entre 7,50-8,50 pour la pinte. J'ai mangé un Burger pas trop cher avec une bonne bière après le Gala de Boxe de Club Gym Yvon Michel au Centre Bell le 3 décembre puis c'était quand même pas mal occupé, belle ambiance, sympathique mais j'ai déja tout vu ça. C'est un bon endroit pour rencontrer quelqu'un pour une première fois, la disposition du bar nous permet de pouvoir manger avec un petite paix relatives, si je peux m'exprimer ainsi, et j'aime bien les band, la musique et le côté pillier bar du Ye Olde Orchard! Belle place, pas si cher sur la bouffe, mais maudit, s't'un pub, c'est au centre-ville, pis c'est cher boire la!"

/user_details?userid=vbKhrWA_guqrxJiROkKUDA,Nick B.,"Scarsdale, NY",5 star rating,"Some friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend, and decided to walk around near our hostel to find a place to eat. Less then a ten minute walk away we found Ye Olde Orchard Pub, and it was exactly what we wanted. It was different than most places we would have gone to in America, the food was great and the waiters were so nice. We mentioned it was my friends 19th birthday expecting a piece of cake, and we got a special drink complete with rules and a name I shouldn't mention. The waiter overheard us talking about where to go that night and came right up to us and suggested about five different bars and clubs we should go to, some of which ended up being the best parts of the night. We couldn't resist going back there the next morning and the breakfast was just as good as the dinner. I would recommend it for anyone but especially if you're a group of traveling students like we were its a great place to go. If we ever go to Montreal again it will be first on our list."
