/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A Mexican review here on a Mexican restaurant. Yes, the food here is fantastic.I visited this place after a very awful day, but the food here made me a happy person again. Portions, speed, flavor, presentation, all amazing.I had the Villamelon Tacos and they are done as the one's in Mexico city. For anyone who is looking for hot salsas, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. You can even order the level of spicyness.I felt like home.The tamales are really good and the chilaquiles are brilliant. The tamarind flavored water was delicious. This is a perfect spot for families, couples, and friends. If you are looking for Mexican candies, Salsas, ordinary Meixcan cuisine tools, this spot is for you. I am definetly coming back.#NoEraPenal"

You can't go wrong with anything you order. The tamales are definitely their forte, my fave was the green chicken tamales but the red pork adobo was also on par. I recommend smothering them in salsa (be for-warned I was skeptical and added a tad bit more than I should have, it is hot). If this still doesn't convince you, grab an elote (whole corn) it is legit and the Tajín does the trick."
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Montreal so far! With all the right colors, friendly smiles and quirky decorative elements. The horchata of the day is invariably fabulous and my favorite may forever remain their Sincronizada Poblana. They also make excellent Tamales. This place truly makes me happy. Do try it!"
/user_details?userid=0C_kTzETOV_1m-fSeYGuJQ,Vivian S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,I'm sure this food is better not order as take out but it's hard to judge that so please keep this in mind when reviewing.  We ordered from Ubereats and the driver got lost so we were pretty famished.Mole tamales wete the thing I was looking forward to most having had some in Mexico and having fond memories.  Flavour was great but tamale was a little dry in texture.  The tacos were yum and the salad was okay..a little high prices I thought.   The spicy sauce was HOT but flavorful.  The horchata tasted goid but I've never had pink horchata so was a little confused by that.   Watermelon juice really refreshing.   Really great flavours all around..we need to try them innperson to give them a fair taste test.
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Happy we finally got to try this place out I'm not usually in this location but it was great!It's very authentic and extremely well priced. I had the gringa which was a large taco with cheese pineapple and chicken, served with onions and coriander on top. The two wedges of lime that came with it was all it needed it was wonderful !! There own hot sauce comes with each plate pretty much so don't you worry spice lovers.Next up we shared the veal sandwich, we weren't exactly sure if it was going to be chicken or veal as it only said melianese on the board but it was okay. The meat wasn't very crispy but the guacamole and fried beans with lettuce and mayo inside made the flavours pop. We tried the corn on the cob stick with mayo and ketchup seasoning, it wasn't fresh the corn and we didn't really like the mayo combination. To be fair it was my first time having it soI'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.Last but not least the crispy little tacos with pork guacamole pineapple and onions, it was really good.Our waitress was very nice and came right up to us as soon as we got in. I was really impressed with all the little pictures and signs and decorations it made you feel like you were at home eating.Would definitely go back"

This place is such a nice little Mexican restaurant, fun for a family night outing or casual friend hangout. I'll confess, I was weary that such an adorable Mexican joint, might mean the food wouldn't be up to par (I'm used to the Saint Hubert street Mexican dives that offer super delicious and authentic food). Although I only had the chance to try the tamales, they were fantastic!! In fact all the food I saw seemed to be the real deal. The only catch is you'll definitely pay more than on Saint Hubert, but it seems worth it to me if you're looking for a slightly more upscale Mexican experience."

/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Amazing little restaurant ! It's quite easy to walk by it or miss it but if you walk in you'll see that this place is decorated quite beautifully and has a great amazing Latin vibe. I had never been able to find elotes until I ate here and they are amazing ! Had 4 different tacos here and each was amazing this fish and al pastor were my favourites. Great flavour and good size ! And if your looking for horchata hit this place up ! Amazing service good food what's not to love ?
/user_details?userid=qu0j85X0gb4Jx7c1FpeEUA,Chelsea R.,"Farmington, CT",5 star rating,"What a beautiful little restaurant nestled near the Mile End district of Montreal-- my friends and I had an amazing experience here. We came an hour before closing, so it was very relaxed and quiet. It was just the four of us who decided to sit down and eat, but near closing a ton of people showed up to get take-out.None of us are fluent in French (traveling) but our waiter was happy to accommodate us in English and Spanish and was especially friendly.I ordered horchata, the tacos al pastor and a pork tamale. The horchata came in a big mason jar which was plenty enough to share with all of my friends and super smooth with just the right amount of mixture. My friend's hibiscus drink also came the same way.The tacos were so good I finished the whole damn thing (this is an accomplishment for someone who gets made fun of for getting full too easily), and the slightly caramelized (or roasted?) pineapple combo with the tender pieces of pork are still something I'm thinking about a week later. All of the salsa I tried was very flavorful with a decent bit of heat, and the tamale was also really well made! I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place, it truly felt like we took a little detour from Canada to experience a family's homemade Mexican meal. The decorations were all very cute and colorful, with photos of Mexican history and culture spread throughout. There was also a little grocery by the register selling various Mexican ingredients for food, candy (Mazapan!) and even a jar full of luchador action figures if you wanted."

/user_details?userid=OyWhTonjjiaIzjSeNPeGcA,Koji S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Perhaps ironically, it was the tamales that we were least impressed by - the other things we ordered were very tasty. The rice-based drink (whose name escapes me) turned out to be the perfect amount of sweet. It's a very petite location, and the decor is delightful; service was a bit slow, but it's clear that they're a bit understaffed/it's a small-scale operation. Price was reasonable! They offer a selection of Mexican ingredients/groceries in the back."

I had the Villamelon tacos, 3 in an order and was chorizos, beef, cactus, and chicharrons (fried pork skin). However, it was too dry, lacking juiciness and the only sauce was insanely spicy.Hortchata was great though and served in a mug!Decent taco place overall."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent Tacos and Tamales! I especially recommend the baja shrimp tacos, they make me go back to this place almost weekly. Service is fast and staff is amicable, great recommendations by them on what to order.

/user_details?userid=zrxI4UP5BhuzX_5SsmzQEw,Beatrice L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"People are always complaining about overpriced Mexican food. This place is not cheap, but the bang is totally worth your buck here. Portions are generous--I innocently ordered a watermelon juice which came in a glass jar so large, it could have lasted me (and a small family) all day. Then I kind of went overboard and ordered two different taco dishes which were both excellent and came out in record time, piping hot and fresh from the kitchen. Flavourful and plentiful in its ingredients. The waitress was a sweetheart too. It's kitschy inside, with all the Frida Kahlo and Dia de Los Muertos paraphernalia that Mexico's neighbours to the north have grown to obsess over in popular culture, but somehow--it all works. Good music, good vibes, good food, good service, all for a good price. Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=Rq8m7cL8SG7mYgNvOXq80w,Marine B.,"Paris, France",4 star rating,"Cute little shop (loved the decoration!) serving authentic Mexican food. I actually cannot testify that it is authentic, since I don't know Mexican cuisine that well, but they serve other things that tacos and burritos, so I guess there's that. We had tameleras (CAN$8) and tacos (CAN$10), and both were very good. We also tried their homemade lemonade (CAN$4 for a pitcher), perfect to go with it. The extra corn with cheese that we indulged in (CAN$5) was however not super good. Overall, I liked the food, I liked the place and the service was very friendly, but it was a bit empty, there was no music in the background, and we felt like the kitchen could close whenever (we arrived early though, because we saw that the restaurant wasn't open late). Maybe it is more of a lunch spot?"

A little heavy on the dough and light on the chicken. I don't have a lot of tamale experience though. Maybe it's meant to be that way? The spicy sauce served with the tamale was green with red pepper flecks throughout. Spicy and good!The cochinita was swimming in an amazing braised broth as topped with pickled onions.   We were fighting over this one.The al pastor tacos were a little dry but had a great flavor and were topped with cilantro and fresh cut pineapple. No canned pineapple here! At the end of the meal I inquired about desert and, lucky me, a decadent Tres leche cake was on the menu. It was beautifully plated, fresh, and not too sweet.I am one happy customer!"

/user_details?userid=zJNHkZeGFuyjz472lmGNTA,Wilson L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Quirky decor, matched with awesome food! It felt modern, with Mexican stereotype flairs. (That was meant as a compliment)The guacamole was creamy, chunky, and full of flavor.Our table shared a couple cheese and chili tamales. They were alright; they were heavy on the masa dough. Having eaten homemade temales from Mexico, the ones from La Tamalera were a far cry from those homemade ones.As a main, I had shredded pork tacos, which came in a tasty pork broth, housed in a pot. The broth was a little on the greasy side, though it wasn't a deal breaker.Overall, the place it tasty and the prices are pretty fair. Definitely worth eating at."

/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"La Diabla on St-Laurent sold homemade tamales before they shut down (RIP). Although their moles and salsas survived the loss of their retail location and are still available around town, I knew of no replacement for their tamale fridge. La Tamalera is a worthy successor. Today they had three flavours (pork, chicken, cheese & jalapeño) and all were excellent. 2.50 each for takeout, 7 for a plate of two with a little bowl of beans and a tiny beer mug of seriously great cooked tomatillo salsa. $4 seemed like a lot for their horchata, until a full litre of it arrived in a mason jar. The pink tint matched the bright decor, and the taste suggested added rosewater or hibiscus. More than enough for two to share. We watched a parade of attractive food go by, destined for a large family seated at one of the five tables in this large, stylish but mostly empty space. The menu is scattered around a few (incomplete) chalkboards, and we needed some help to make sense of it (and discover the $7 tamales plate). There were great-looking brunch options as well. Will be back. Overall, the food is on par with Tachido but the physical environment may need work for this place to pull in customers. Don't leave without checking out the bathroom."

/user_details?userid=_PlVMtt4bwiOAalr1wso9A,Grant H.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"Ô DIOS MIO!!!!!!!!!So, about a month ago I was thinking to myself: ""Man, those tortas at Tachido are amazing, it'd be great to have a tamale somewhere in Montréal as well!  Maybe I should learn how to make them myself?  I wish that I had a grandmother from Mexico to show me how..."" and suddenly, whilst heading back from buying something or other at the Delphi, I noticed a cute little pink sign poking out of the place that used to be that librairie/café/n'importquoi that did incredibly well while Arts was shut for renovatios.  I decided to investigate.First impression: the windows were filled with catholicious candles and further in there were some repurposed wine boxes and cute little knick-knacks from el pais viejo adorabling (=adorning+aborable) the walls.  My interest was MUY piqued.After strolling up to the bar, I checked to see if there were any TAMALES available and unfortunately they weren't going to be ready for an hour...no probs, I assume that they were devoured by the teeming masses.  I returned after a few hours and asked the delightful chef/owner about what the tamale offerings were: spicy chili and cheese, chicken and salsa verde, and by the time I had dug into those I had completely lost my mind and forgotten what the third one was.  It was delicious, I can say that for certain.  Most insane thing: 6 tamales = 15$, canadian.  For perspective on this for those who are uninitiated to tamales, I used to pay $3 in 2006 in California and think that that was cheap.  I'll be surprised if they don't bump up a little in price, but in any case they are certainly worth an extra buck or so.  In addition to the tamales, I did notice that they offer some other delicious treats (pozole, tortas, etc) for what looks like a fair price.I returned today as I am a glutton and was feeling peckish on the way home from the Y, so I picked up 4 more and as well as a concha and I was again shocked at how good her food is.  It was sort of slow we had a little minute to chat and it turns out that she's got a great deal of experience in her madre's restaurant in Mexico and she went to culinary school in Mexico as well!  I used to snarf down conchas in Watsonville any time I passed a Panaderia and this one was the absolute freshest and lightest one that I've had to date.I haven't tried it yet, but, horchata too?!?!  I am hooked.Viva la tamalera!"
