/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"I LOVE this little place! Chez Sophie is pretty quiet, small which makes it have an intimate atmosphere. We ordered the tasting menu for 85$ which includes 1 appetizer,2 main course and a dessert (anything from the menu). After ordering, the waiter brought us some bread and some sort of Salami. They also gave us a amuse bouche which was refreshing to the pallet. For the appetizers we took the duck confit nems (nems=fried spring roll) and the bone marrow on toast. The duck was crispy, yet juicy with so much rich flavor.It tasted like a peeking duck with all the works rolled up in a perfectly fried spring roll. The bone marrow toast was well toasted and savoury. It tasted like creamy luscious butter with bone marrow. Both appetizers were so incredibly flavourful. For the second course we ordered the seared scallops and the lobster raviolis, bisque and sautéed spinach.The lobster raviolis were impeccable. 3 perfectly symmetrical raviolis laid on a bed on sautéed spinach. There was a hood ratio of lobster meat and very juicy. The scallops were well seared on both sides and it was topped with something crispy, which gave it a nice crunchy texture. Last course...My S/O took the filet of angus beef and I took the crispy veal sweetbread (Im not a veal lover - but the fowl was excluded from the tasting menu and I wanted to take something different to take). I can say I have 0 regrets on taking the veal.  The angus beef was tender and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.For dessert we took the Paris Brest dessert which is French choux pastry with chocolate flavoured cream and a Japanese tapioca. The pastry was flaky sweet and the tapioca had a fruity refreshing taste. When paying the bill they give you chocolate like nibs, as a way to end the dinner. The detail isn't just in the presentation or the taste but it's also how they treat their customers from beginning to end. If you give them the coat they'll help you put it on (very courteous)! Definitely recommend this place for a special occasion! Going back very soon"

We ordered almost everything on the menu  with a few substitions for their ravioli specials. Omfg just everything was amazing. Rich but light. Tasty and decadent. Really top notch french fare. Would come back to montreal just for another meal here. Incredible dining experience
/user_details?userid=3O-wdi5RqZHCovQ5c2a1eg,Katherine V.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I went to Chez Sophie back in August when we were spending a long weekend in Montreal and even though it was a few months ago, I still remember the delicious food and great service. After arriving at our reserved time, we were promptly seated at a table across from the bar. After a moment of looking over the menus, the waiter came over to answer any questions we may have and take our drink order. I ordered a gin and yuzu cocktail which was like a delicious yuzu slushy. We each opted for the tasting menu where you can pick an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert.After ordering they brought fresh bread and some sort of salami (tasted more like bologna but whatever it was still good) for the table. They also gave us an amuse bouche of melon soup with olive oil drizzle.For appetizers we ordered the bone marrow tartine, which was a bit hard to share but still excellent, and pan seared foie gras with clementine, dill, and artichoke chips. We also ordered the sea bream carpaccio with bottarga, lemon cream, and mullet caviar as an extra dish which was a good thing because it was one of my favorite dishes of the night. For the main course we each ordered the roasted  scallops with fregola sarda and chanterelle risotto and porcini emulsion. This dish was by far the best of the night. I normally do not like mushrooms and was going to just by pass the risotto but I ate every single bite it was so good. We also had the duck magret in port sauce with millefeuilles of fig, foie gras, apple and beet, duck confit and herb roasted veal striploin with crispy polenta, glazed vegetables and hay infused veal jus. Both were also delicious. By the time dessert rolled around we were so full we opted for only one dessert so they gave us a full sized one instead of the smaller portions you get with the tasting menu. We ordered the ""Chocolate Suprise"" which was vanilla ice cream incased in chocolate sphere with molten chocolate pour over. The dessert was rich and a bit heavy but if you like chocolate it would be perfect for you.Everything we ate here was great! The service was excellent and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy yet stylish, a great place for a date night."
/user_details?userid=PW50KG6menpoHdKeYLAvTg,David L.,"Highland Park, IL",5 star rating,"**A taste of fine fusionist dining with a wonderful staff in a relaxing, intimate space**Chez Sophie is housed what could have easily been an old hardware or antique store. As you walk in, you see the address, 1974, emblazoned boldly on a building that was probably built thereabouts.The dining hall is narrow and the tables are large around, giving the inside of the restaurant a sense of space while also being intimate.The menu is has a range of different types of meals, which include seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.For drinks, I had a New York Sour (highly recommend it); for entrees, my girlfriend and I had the veal carpaccio, which was a delicious salty snack wrapped inside a croissant-like tube.The main course offered too many tantalizing options to choose from. Ultimately, it came down to the square of deer vs. the lobster ravioli. I ended up choosing the deer and was not disappointed. The meat was an unstoppable combination of tenderness and lusciousness.For desert, I had the sponge cake, which tasted fantastic against the backdrop of chocolate soaked chestnuts and cream crackers. But the real piece de resistance of the desert menu was the humbly named ""chocolate surprise"". This scrumptious sphere of cacao goodness is presented with a cream filling and an additional spout of boiling chocolate which they pour on the top, melting the first layer into the cream layer and creating a swirl wonderland. Somebody call Walter White because this desert just broke bad in the best of ways!By the time you get out of your seat and see the large bill you racked up in your reckless state of culinary inebriation, you won't care because you will be happily counting down the days until your next dining adventure at Chez Sophie!"

We made a reservation for 27 people and met with Sophie and Marco a few days prior and both were so accommodating and nice, giving great suggestions for menu. The prices are incredible for the food that you get, presentation and detail are of a top notch restaurant.Long story short, every single person in our party was amazed with the food, service and decor.Thank you for such a great experience on our special day! Highly recommended!!!!"

/user_details?userid=j_qzA5E1sEVAuTqv6KOA2w,Blake M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If culinary technical proficiency were the only basis of for assigning a value to this restaurant it would be 110%. We were four and tried almost half the menu, and while we all admired the impressive skill that went into the preparation of the food, there was not a single dish that wowed. The wines we chose and that were suggested were exquisite, I am not sure what the current mode is for markup in a restaurant setting but the prices seem a bit exaggerated to me.The service was great, the lighting and decor a bit off. Not sure what else to say other than it was the most expensive restaurant experience of my life, and I eat out a lot. I wish I had liked it more than I did. I think they need to work on putting a real signature spin on the food in order to make the value for money equation work."

/user_details?userid=YghPMYNZVYeAHpVGnLN8tg,Elle M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The food was fantastic. They made slight substitutions for my dairy intolerance. Very few restaurants are willing to accommodate, so I really appreciated the effort. Their dairy-free risotto was heavenly. I miss risotto and certainly got my fix at Chez Sophie. My dinner partner is a meat lover and can eat everything. He had the lamb, which he raved about. I recommend sitting on the patio if weather permits. The atmosphere is much better out there."

/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I just had supper at Chez Sophie last night and it was a fantastic meal! It is among the best ones I have had this year. We shared the suggested appetizer, a special for the night. It was a sauté of slivered wild mushrooms with a foie gras and yellow wine reduction with a dash of fresh herbs. It was divine. The other recommended item was a oeuf croustillant that I will keep on my ""to try"" list for my next visit. As for the main course, the halibut of the night was highly recommended, but I went with the roasted lobster and shredded oxtail instead. It was fantastic. The oxtail and underlying potato mousseline had a sweetness to it that paired wonderfully with the rest of the plate and the spinach was a nice touch to add to the meat and lobster. Our dessert, a chocolate surprise was not as exciting. By then,we were already stuffed (not because there was too much food, but because we had both eaten elsewhere 2 hrs prior). There was too much chocolate and too little poached pear. At the end of the meal, they also brought out two little dark chocolate coated crispy nuggets. Sadly, I was in a chocolate coma and the frozen treats were too much. Had I not had the dessert, I would've been very happy with such a treat to end my evening! We did not have drinks, but the cocktail list did look very intriguing and I hear the sommelier is very knowledgeable. The details in the decor and even the waiters uniform are unique. The entrance is very cosy in case you have to sit and wait for a seat. The only downside is that when both doors are open, there is a cold breeze that runs across the front part of the restaurant. I would not want to sit at the front in the winter! Before taxes and tips, we spent about $60 each ( shared appetizer and shared dessert) without any wine. This is definitely on the pricier side for a meal, but the appetizer and main course were so good I would definitely keep this one on my list of special occasion restaurants. If you want a fantastic meal and are ready to splurge a little, then definitely try Chez Sophie, you will not be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=eRFKvm3J22-_Upspugs6Bw,Damon G.,"Arlington, MA",3 star rating,"I somewhat have to agree with Blake's review. My wife and I just got back from there tonight and everything was very well done but it was missing that special something for me to really feel like the $190 bill was something I want to go back for. I did the pre fix menu and had two glasses of wine and a coffee. My wife, who is pregnant couldn't drink and only had juice water and an entree. The wine was well selected, the shrimp and scallops cooked perfectly. Maybe it's value more than flavor that it seemed a little light on...I guess I can't quite put my finger on it. I'd go with 3.5 stars but the app doesn't allow half stars. I'd go to 4 it they knocked a little off the bill. I guess I have to round down to three but that feels slightly harsh. Damon"
/user_details?userid=7MjOYMGlsuMhFkemJ9Mr9g,Enrique A.,"Hato Rey, Puerto Rico",5 star rating,"It has been a while since I have fallen absolutely on love with a restaurants. Chez Sophie has become another one of the few in this exclusive category for me. The staff is very polite, welcoming and most importantly attentive. Appetizers are very reasonable. Ask for the specials since sometimes it can be a welcoming surprise. Tonight it just so happened to be salad topped with foie gras. There was a nice balance between the foie gras and the balsamic based dressing. I also tasted the risotto with shrimp that has made it into my top 5 risottos I've had. Main courses were well portioned. The veal was perfectly cooked and had amazing taste. All I can say is by the looks of the other plates passing by I wish I could've tried everything. This gives me an excuse to return and try the rest.Summary: Great service and amazing food.Recommendation: Make reservations before coming. It gets really full."
/user_details?userid=MomJVTU0FOt9H-d1LCyU8A,Richard H.,"Tallahassee, FL",5 star rating,"We were led to this fine restaurant by a poster for a festival of food from or inspired by Martinique, a French island in the West Indies where I lived for a few years a long time ago. About 20 restaurants were featuring one or two such dishes or drinks on their menus.  We picked this restaurant mostly based on its location -- it fit into our visitor itinerary for the day -- and we could not have been more pleased.  We were among only a few customers for a weekday lunch, and got extremely attentive service.  We sat in the small enclosed outdoor terrace, in the rear, as did all the other customers.  The Martiniquais dish for the day was advertised as cod fritters -- of which there are many versions from the West Indies -- but really it was elegantly served tender fresh cod in a succulent cucumber and coconut sauce.  The heavenly dessert was seasonal berries (straw-, rasp-, and blue-) in a reduction of similar berries.  This meal was the highlight of a too brief autumn visit to the city."
