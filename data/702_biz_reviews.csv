For some reason, we never thought of trying it until my mom won a gift-certificate of the place and that's when we decided to go at the beginning of January 2019. Being that this restaurant is in Quartier Dix30, I wasn't expecting it to be less than great. It's in a very calm setting, placed on the second floor in the Square and easy to access from the indoor parking. The decor of this place is stunning, beautiful colours, textures and designs with pink being the main theme. The bathroom was incredibly clean as well as beautiful, continuing the theme for the oriental decor. The music is mostly Lebanese, perfectly fitting with the theme of the restaurant. The staff members are very helpful, very welcoming and as soon as my family and I arrived we got directed to a nice table, with very comfortable seating. They explained the different options they had on the menu and which one would be more fit for us. As for the food, we decided to settle for the ""Grand Festin Libanais"" for 42$/person. It included 6 cold and 6 hot mezza plates, grilled meat of all kinds and desert. For four people, this is MORE than enough. The food is DELICIOUS. Tabbouleh and fattoush were fresh and it was easy to tell it was made on the spot, not a long time ago. The vine leaves were absolutely delicious, as well as the falafel, hummus and baba ghannouj. The cheese rolls were also out of this world, felt very fresh. The meat, which arrived later on, was very well cooked and perfectly seasoned. Finally, the deserts reminded me of Lebanon and the ones I buy over there; nammoura, baklava, etc. As for drinks, they have a very large selection of Lebanese (Kefraya, Ksara) and other wines, as well as your typical cocktails, scotchs, and other. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a delicious Lebanese experience. I believe this is the best Lebanese restaurant I've tried in Montreal in a very long time."

When I arrived inside, I was mesmerized by its decor, by its colors scheme and by its beautiful furnitures.Their service is amazing, friendly, and helpful. We went for lunch to celebrate our friends birthday. My two girlfriends ordered from the tasting menu. I ordered from the table d'hôte. I had a delicious lentil soup but the rest of my food were average. My fish was slightly pasty, but the hummus sauce compensated the dish. I asked for a birthday treat for my friend; she gets a creamy whipped yogurt with strawberries with a candle. We got baklavas automatically but the server didn't ask if we wanted something else for desert. Baklava's aren't really my favorite but these tasted pretty ok.The company of good friends made the restaurant experience good."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The special tasting menu was fun since we got to try many different things. Everything was good and fresh and nicely prepared. The other items such as the chicken and garlic potatoes is not that good compared to shish taouk places and is expensive. The place is clean and nicely decorated. Plenty if parking spots as it is located in the center of dix30. They have an outside terrasse during summer so the view is awesome.

It was sunny and very windy so we couldn't eat outside with the umbrella open because it was almost flying away. We were seated inside right beside the private room, with glasses of water right away. The decor blows me away the colors and designs it's really beautiful.So I'll cut to the chase, FOOD!We got two drinks to start margarita and Long Island iced tea, both were okay. We then had the fattouche salad which was fantastic and then with the chaklish. The hummus with steak and pine nuts was great and the fried cheese with tomatoes was excellent. We thought that we would be able to finish it but of course our eyes were bigger then our stomachs so we packed up and our waiter gave us extra pitas to go home for the hummus. We got a bottle of wine as well thought it said 40 on the menu but our bill said 46 so not sure about that. At the end of everything we were given two little desserts with creme in them, SO GOOD and not to sweet just right."

/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I've now visited Zyara Dix30 twice. I love how convenient the underground parking, and that they have a terrace overlooking the fountain in the Square. Make no mistake, Zyara is a beautiful and elegant restaurant, with gorgeous decor and attention to detail. Even the bathrooms are something to marvel at!My first visit was a couple of years ago for my birthday. What a delicious and memorable meal that was. I ordered the mixed grilled platter as my main course (took half of it home) and the meaty hummus as an appetizer, served with complimentary, fresh pita out of the oven, and a zaatar* & olive oil dip. We had great service, and enjoyed the lovely meal out on the terrace. *zaatar is toasted sesame seeds with dried, powdered thyme and saltMy second visit was this summer, I tried a bigger portion of their menu. Everything was amazing! My favourite plates to share were the: beet salad, arayess, manti, mahalabiya dessert served in 2 styles, and knafeh another Lebanese dessert.My foodie mind was blown, which is not easy to accomplish! I love that there are an equal amount of vegetarian friendly and meat-lover's options at Zyara. Being extremely familiar with Lebanese food, I enjoyed the modern twist on some of these recipes."

Our waiter was very kind and generous to help us it our desicions  it might be a bit costly for some. I paid 80$ but every penny was worth it! I'd recommend and go again for sure"
/user_details?userid=oIrvWK6R33DUFdWbklvhrw,Le Hien D.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"It was nice summer evening, the sun was still up there  so we decided to eat on a terrace with another couple. I wanted to give Zyara another try since the 1st time nothing blew my mind. They are offering a interesting menu concept for 2-4 persons, there are different options of Exploration Menu.we decided to treat ourselves with the menu Royal with around 10 dishes to share with 4 persons...best decision we made! It gives you the chance to taste alot item in the menu from cold to hot/grilled food! From salads to ""spinach flaky pastry pasta in a tomato sauce"" very deliciousMy highlights-the braised eggplant -beef hummus-giant shrimp-lamb chopYou will get 1 giant shrimp and 1 lamb chop per person but i would have eat a whole plate of lamb chop!! It was tender and nicely seasoned! Yum yum! I will come back for that for sure!Overall, it was an experience and i recommend to go with a group so you can taste all the dishes in the menu! Very worth it! Royal discovery menu is 50$/pers but you will be full no worries, there is a lot of food.The restaurant is nicely decorated and the terrace is fun at night!I will come back...for the lamb chop and the beef hummus."
/user_details?userid=GdTS4o3A-vKQTvof-anwaA,Myriam A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you are planning on eating at Zyara, you should stop eating 24 hours before your visit or you won't be able to taste everything! The food is delicious!!! We were 4 people and decided to go with the 42$ menu that comes with cold and hot mezze, grillades and dessert. This option on their menu says it's for up to 4 people but the amount of food you get is enormous that could easily add 2 more people.Everything tasted really good. The meat was sooo tender it totally melts in your mouth.When we got to the dessert, there was two choices included in the menu. Since we were the last customers, the waiter decided to give us a little more stuff to try. We loved it all!!!I definitely recommend this place, the service was great and the terrace is very nice!!!"

We off the lunch special menu- Le Plat du Jour- it was filling and delicious. There was grilled chicken, hummus, chickpeas, rice, arugula, tomatoes, onions, cabbage and in a delicious yogurt dressing.  The special includes fresh pita with a sesame seed dip and coffee and dessert. The ambiance was lovely. Waiter told us they have belly dancing on Fridays lovely experience"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to Zyara restaurant yesterday for dinner with family. I love the location, it is extremely accessible and of course being in the stylish dix30, underground parking is super convenient. The interior is bright and modern with middle eastern detailing such as the mashrabiya panels hanging from the ceiling and arch shaped doorways... Absolutely beautiful, could stay there for hours! We were lucky to get a glimpse of the belly dancing show too which started around 8.30pm and the lights dimmed and music got super loud! We ordered the set menu for 5 people which had a great variety of starters (see images) and then a lot of dishes for the main course. We thought it wouldnt be enough but we were all super full to end with as the portions were a good decent size. I particularly loved the lamb chops, extremely succulent and tasty. My husband went crazy about the king shrimps, they were huge and in a delicious sauce. Service was very good, we loved the abundance of fresh hot pita bread, that really was a plus! Now for the negative points:I found the music way too loud, we literally had to be talking super loud to each other in order to be heard... If you want a quiet family environment, I wouldn't recommend ZyaraI found the dessert extremely disappointing for how much we paid. It was part of the set menu along with tea and coffee but we were only given 6 small pieces of baklava... For a total of $350 for 6 people, I found that terrible! Overall, I would definitely visit Zyara again especially in the summer as the interior is full of natural light. I loved the quality of the food and for that, recommend all foodies to try it!!"

Had two lunch specials and while everything was good it didn't stand out as exceptional for me. The scallop dish was a so so.The place is beautiful though. And there is a baby changing table

Do your calculations before getting carried away by tasters menu, their plates are reasonable priced and portions are generous !! It can be cheaperto go a la carte rather than payin 40-48-50$ per person"

On certain evenings there are belly dancing performances. The food is great, not cheap, but considering the location and the setting, the price is acceptable. I ordered a la carte but the tasting menu seems like a good way to get a sampling of many items on their menu."

I have 2 blog posts on it: -Restaurant (main dining area): arzanrestos.blogspot.ca/…-Private room: http://http://arzanrestos.blogspot.ca/I've been to there lounge last year. It's very cozy but I'm planning on going back very soon again! They have electronic shisha now! Excited to try it out :D"

Had both an English and French menu which is just an extra detail that a tourist appreciates. I had the lamb shank which was fantastic! Keep up the amazing service. As a tourist I appreciated everything.

/user_details?userid=rXHHlHivRU7Wl1LLVuBY0A,Jeffrey R.,"Avondale, AZ",5 star rating,"We went here for the first time yesterday and we will definitely return.  The decor was reminiscent of a Middle Eastern palace reimagined by Disney and it was fun, interesting, and very inviting.  Just the beginning of a wonderful experience.  Our server was friendly, fun, and more than willing to answer questions, help with pronunciations, and provide good company without being intrusive.Our meals arrived well presented and appealing to look at.  The freshly baked bread was a delight.  The lentil soup was delicious and the Lebanese-style poutine verges on being a classic.  Thanks to the unique stock (prepared in the restaurant in a 24-hour process), the gravy is richer and thicker than a usual poutine.  Unfortunately, we don't get to Montreal as often as we would like, but Zyara might just change that!"

/user_details?userid=4HDjoABQu80CHEKKpvZTSg,Nabila O.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",3 star rating,The food is great as well as the staff who is courteous and helpful.I love the decoration the location and the food is really great.The only thing I really hate is the noise. There is no soundproofing  and on a busy day it is very noisy to the point my party could not have any discussion and we ate fast to leave as we could not bear the noise level. If you are looking for a great food experience this a good place to discover the Lebanese cuisine but I wish they could do something about the soundproofing
/user_details?userid=MN5d_hIjpkInJ2dCbUAxww,Louay T.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"As a Lebanese living in Montreal area, i can tell this newly opened restaurant offers a variety of dishes with homemade taste and authenticity. 5/5 for food tasteAs for the prices, they fall between average to high but can be explained by the location (new hip sector of the dix30) and of course the quality.Decor is 5/5 trendy, chic but yet very simpleService i would rate 3.5/5 unexperienced local staff with lack of knowledge on the dishes/desserts.They also have an amazing terrace (note that the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor)You can order shisha on the terrace (25$ excluding the tip). The shisha waiter, a young gentleman called Mohamed) prepares it with his unique egyptian style.(The shisha are Khalil Maamoun brand rated #1 worldwide)This is my 2nd time there and will definitely go back again"
/user_details?userid=M8ZoXoqSexnzDReGIKlLSw,Suska S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decor of the place is awesome, like modern ali baba's harem, and the lighting is just perfect. The food was pretty good, but for some reason not enough to warrant 5 stars from me. Maybe it was the portions, maybe it was the price, we ordered mixed grill plate, with shangleesh (arabic cheese mixture i used to hate as a kid, but i loved it here!), hummus with meat (very little amount of meat), babaghanoush (not the best ive had), cheese rolls (4 skinny tall rolls, not worth the 12$ price tag), cheese rikakat (miniature hallumi pita sandwitch), and kibbeh nayyeh (what some peeps call beef tartar lol). The pita comes baked fresh which is awesome, only downfall is that we had to keep asking for more since the place was pretty empty the day we came. Maybe when its full, the pita is continuously offered? After our third one, we all got shy and stopped asking! The mezzas are pretty small for the price (11$ each plate on average) we basically each spent 40$ eating just mezzas and a few pieces of meat from the mixed plate. I guess im spoiled having just came back from dearborn and having a huge grilled feast (with alottta meat!) for under 25$ a person. Overall, pretty decent. I think its best to come with a huge group and make a night out of it. The private room looks amazing!Also we expected a bellydancer since it was friday, but she wasnt there :("
/user_details?userid=oqrkET25-S3LZK7OMuOUyg,Stefany P.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Everything was so fresh and good. We took 5 plates under 10$ to share and enjoyed everyone of them. The tartare is amazing, the salads and the grilled filet mignon are really good. The only thing expensive is the wine, the cheapest bottle was 30$ and there wasn't any left so we had a 40$ bottle. The decor is really amazing, the only down side is, I don't know if they are still waiting on a permit but you can't drink on the terrase :("

Not easy to find lebanese beef tartare in south shore.  Prices are a little high, but considering location, I suppose it's decent."
