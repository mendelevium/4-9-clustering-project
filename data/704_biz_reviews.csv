/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Extremely satisfied. I ordered through ubereats and can definitely say that their pizzas are delicious, even take out! I got the inglewood pizza and it was amazing. The crust and dough were amazing. The great char provided a nice balance with the tomato sauce, speaking of which was also delicious. The sauce was not overly acidic and was well flavoured. As for the cheese, it was definitely a highlight. I just wish they provided slightly more of it. I also got a coleslaw Caesar salad and was very pleased. It was an interesting twist on a normal Caesar salad. So instead of lettuce, it was coleslaw, instead of anchovies, it was capers. I found this salad to be so delicious that I can't wait to have it again!Finally for dessert, I had the tiramisu. Once again, this was delicious. The perfect balance of flavours and definitely a nice portion size. The only negative thing I found was that it was slightly watery on the base. However, this did not really have a negative effect on the dish. Overall, I really cannot wait to order from here again (and hopefully dine-in)!"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fugazzi pizza has totally become our go-to for delivery pizza in the Sud-Ouest. There's a few reasons for this but if I'm being honest it probably has a lot to do with their vegan options. Most pizza places (maybe) only offer one vegan pizza and it's covered in Daiya cheese (gross) or Gusta (slightly less gross). Fugazzi has several vegan options, as well as they make all of their fake cheese and meat in house. All this equating to that the pizza is actually good.For us omnivores, there are obviously some delicious options. My personal favourite is the wutang killah bees but I often order the Inglewood for a solid cheese za'. The crust, while not my absolute favourite, is much better than some of the other local options.While I only got to visit the space once, like others have mentioned, the decor is super fun at Fugazzi. I'm a sucker for good nostalgia and this place nails it. Additionally, we found the service to be on point. While sitting at the bar we got to chat with the bartender who was a delight (they also made some excellent cocktails!). Speaking of cocktails, I highly recommend visiting Milky Way (upstairs from the restaurant) after Fugazzi- together they make a terrific date night."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Love their pizzas! My favourites: Liberace (4 cheese) and Killa Bees (calabrese and honey). Their Margarita is great too and a wonderful deal (just $8.50!). One pro tip: order their homemade dips for your pizza crust. My go to dip: the ranch. Yum!Their appetizers are fabulous too... especially the burrata and the meatballs.Very cool decor at the restaurant and a nice (and hip) staff. Can't wait to get a chance to eat in again at this place. Another pro tip: you can eat Fugazzi food upstairs at the Milky Way Bar while enjoying all sorts of creative and delicious cocktails. Also a cool vibe there.

I ordered the Inglewood Pizza through Uber Eats. The Inglewood pizza has Fugazzi Tomato Sauce, Fior Di Latte, Basil & Parmesan. Food arrived hot! Pizza was absolutely delicious and was exactly what I hoped it would be!! Ingredients tasted fresh and complimented each other very well. Would definitely recommend this establishment and will be ordering from here more often!"
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cute and trendy Italian food joint in Pointe st-Charles. The restaurant is owned by the same group as other popular restaurants in Montreal (Barroco, Bocata, Foiegwa) etc... so you can expect good quality food, service, ambiance and a very instagrammable dish. We shared : garlic brioche (5/5 soft and melted in mouth), octopus & sausage (5/5 octopus was tender, sausage was more like a paste but still very good), cavatelli pasta with rapini and sausage (5/5 al denté pasta with creamy sauce), wu tan pizza (5/5 dough was crispy ends but chewy on the thicker parts, ingredients fresh)Overall loved the place and would definitely come back!!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Fugazzi Pizza has been in my radar since its inception in Pointe Saint Charles. It's literally 5 minutes walk from my parents. So as family, we went to Fugazzi Pizza for lunch. The restaurant decor is so retro style. If you look around, you will find, a gum ball machine, yellow football helmet , VCR, with VHS, radio with cassette holder, a heavy square box computer and many more. It has an excellent funky and fun vibe. The service is beyond perfect! It was pretty quick, but they felt some dishes were late, they kept telling us it is coming but honestly, everything was presented in timely manner. I tried White Yeti Wine; and it was simply the best wine ever. It's not sweet and it's not bitter, the taste is perfectly balanced! My lunch was shared with my mom. We had Inglewood pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil) and rigatoni a l'amatriciana, And with slight spicy oil, it was so delicious. I felt I can always eat this, but must look out for these carbs.The prices were heavily high but the quality was superior. Definitely, you need to try this place."

We also had the scallop ceviche last time as an appetizer which was really great.
/user_details?userid=KxLbWqQhDlNuF88_h_17OQ,Brad H.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",5 star rating,"Our favorite pizza spot in Montreal so far, but we prefer this style more than the usual greasy local spots. Always tastes fresh! If you get it delivered throw it in the oven real quick. Bad ass packaging, personal touch/feel to this spot. Can't go wrong."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Referenced in iconic movies such as Wolf of Wallstreet or Donnie Brasco for those who remember, 'fugazzi' in Italian slang infers to something that is fake or just simply doesn't exist; well let me tell you, Pizza Fuggazzi is faaaar from that!The owners of Barrocco Group (Barrocco, Bocata, Foiegwa, Atwater Cocktail Club) are not Italian by birth but they do share a huge passion for pizza and just recently inaugurated an amazing pizza joint located in the ever changing Pointe St-Charles (PSC) neighbourhood. The menu is solid and delivers mouth watering options:Marinara: classic pizza pie with tomato, garlic, oregano and olive oil.Inglewood: authentic Neapolitan Margarita pizza with tomato, mozzarella, basil and soft thin crust with and slightly burned puffy edges.Wu Tang Killa Bees: Tomato, Calabrese, Honey, Thyme Oil, Mozzarella. ... and a half a dozen more delicious variations to choose from! The dough and sauces are all homemade, then cooked for probably no more than 90 seconds at 700-900F in a classic wood fired oven. But that's not all, you can carb load to your hearts content with homemade pastas such as ricotta gnocchi, cavatelli & sausage, rigatoni al' amatriciana, tagliatelle bolognese and even squid ink bucatini vongole - delizioso! There's also a nice choice of wine bottles, cocktails and a few beers on tap; I was quite impressed by rye based the O.C., dangerously smooth and balanced.Designed by the Gauley Brothers and owners, the decor is an eclectic rendition of the 80s. Depending on your view, you'll see cheesy leopard style walls, a paper shark, white tiles, an Italian nook with plaid tablecloth & snazzy lamp shade, satirical and iconic works of art, a and a series of strategically places objects such as shimmer purses, a wheel cap, and even an old Macintosh computer!Opened only a couple of weeks ago, you definitely feel the angst and febrility in the air as minor kinks are being worked out but the vibe is spectacular, filled with beautiful guests and supported by a very warm and attentive staff. This seems to be a promising hot spot in PSC, especially with the recently inauguration of an upstairs speakeasy where one can sip on cocktails under a giant glass dome called Milky Way Cocktail Bar. Will have to come back with friends to try more pizzas and pastas!"
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,"We started off by ordering the Fugazzi garlic bread, which to me was pretty much very similar to a Chinese sweet bread with their own little twist. Buttery, fluffy and I believe had parmesan shaving. A great option if you want to use it to dip in your remaining meatball tomato sauce. Price: $4.75Rating: 6/10Cons: Not enough garlic___________________________________As an appetizer, we ordered the citrus salad which I personally felt like it was missing the wow factor- When they say citrus, what they really mean is grapefruit or at least that's what it was presented at the moment we ordered it. With olive oil and grapefruit juice, I personally felt like the dressing lacked a bit more zest and salt. In my book, I felt like this dish was too simple to execute and easy for me to just make it at home. Price: $7.50Rating: 4/10  Cons: Lacked flavour, nothing impressive.We also added the Cacciocavallo meatballs which definitely won my heart. With the slight crisp on the outside, this meatball is filled with cheese on the inside. Yes you read that right, cheese filled. Not overly salty and very flavourful, nothing to tweak in my opinion. Do me a favour and order that as an appetizer. It's worth to try.Price: $7.75Cons: I wish I had more.___________________________________I previously heard mix reviews about their pizza but knew I had to try it myself in order to have my own input about this business. We were torn by many choices but chose to go with the Wu Tang Killa Bees and Mush Pit. First off, I just want to pin point how much I appreciate the names of these pizza- very creative. The Wu Tang pizza is tomato sauce base, with calabrese, honey, thyme oil and for di latte. With just a little touch of sweetness, the honey was an excellent choice to pair with the calabrese. If you appreciate the dough from Adamo, Fugazzi's pizza are slightly thicker. Price:  $14.00Cons: None If you want to try something that is not tomato-base, the Mush Pit is a bianco pizza which seemed to be my friends favourite. The Mush Pit pizza has: wild mushrooms, douanier, ricotta, parmesan and fior di latte. Since I am a big fan of anything truffle, maybe you can offer the client some truffle shaving or oil at an additional cost? You know, just to add that extra kick. That's just my two cent.Price: $21.00Cons: Offer truffle oil at an additional cost. ___________________________________I was extremely please with my experience at Fugazzi. The service was attentive, the staff always made sure we were satisfied and made sure our glass of water was always full. The price point was fair. Since this place is small, a large party might be a little difficult to accommodate. Personally the best seating on the house for me remains close to the kitchen or at the bar. The tiny down fall is that I personally thought the music was too loud for my liking. I had to shout a couple of time to make sure my friends could hear me.Price: $$Food: 7.7/10Atmosphere: 7.8/10Value: 7.2/10"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"Fugazzi Pizza is a cute restaurant with indeed funky, but warm decor. We were party of five and unfortunately got one of the most uncomfortable seats in the restaurant, kind of picnic table with narrow benches. Frankly this table has to be removed as we had a back pain at the end of our dinner.  Drinks menu is interesting and satisfying. The Bloody Caesar of Fugazzi definitely deserves its own paragraph. Delicious spiciness on the rim of the glass, lots freshness introduced by the sliced veggies, strongly recommended if you are a lover of this cocktail. Food wise Fugazzi offers good selection of Italian dishes. I would define our choice of appetizer as kind of strange: carrots with tahini and pistachios, a combination of ingredients that sounds great, but is not as appetizing. The Inglewood pizza we had was delicious, very nice crust and well balanced ingredients. You can order extras with your pizza that will cost you between one and five dollars, depending on what you want. We took extra garlic, but I frankly didn't feel it on the pizza. We also experimented with the lobster squid ink bucatini, a dish I would recommend based on the bucatini experience, they were superbly long and therefore fun to eat, although the lobster sauce could have been more elaborate the bucatini were cooked to perfection and really made an outstanding impression.   My rating for Fugazzi Pizza is three stars and a half. I would come back, but I'm sincerely not in a hurry based on the growing competition for Italian cuisine in the area."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really excited to come here because pizza is my favorite meal! Also I really like Barroco and Foiegwa. This restaurant did not live up to my expectations however.We grabbed the last table available. The vibe was fun and hipster. The music is a bit odd because it was a mix of everything.My boyfriend and I started with a bloody fool which is smokey Bloody Caesar with basil. The drink was good but it took a long time to get and I realized we hadn't ordered food yet and I was starving. The service here is slow! Luckily the waiter heard me and came over to take our food order.We started with the meatballs. I have to say these meatballs were the best I've ever had! The outside was crunchy and inside there was cheese! OMG So good!! We ordered the Wutang Killa bees pizza which had tomato, calabrese, honey, thyme and mozarella. This pizza tasted like an a pepperoni pizza but every once in awhile you would get a bite of honey. The sweetness of the honey pairs well with the calabrese. Out of the two pizzas we ordered this one was my fave.The second pizza we ordered the Donnie Brasco contained mortadella, burrata, ricotta and roquette. Honestly I was disappointed with this pizza. It wasn't bad but to me it tasted like a ham sandwich in pizza format. It was underwhelming and it was $25!I do like the crusts and I like that each table has spicy oil even though the oil wasn't very spicy.I hate to say this but will not be back. There's better pizza joints in MTL."

/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I got a reservation on a Friday night for 5 people at 7pm. They advised us that we had to be out by 9:30 for the second seating which was fine by us. I shared 3 pizzas with my two friend. We had the Wu Tang Killa Bees, the Mushpit and the Donnie Brasco. My favorite was the Mushpit. The Donnie Brasco had mortadella on the pizza but it really didnt go well with the rest of the ingredients. It was my least favorite pizza and at that price I expected much better. The MushPit was good if you like mushrooms but still very basic. The Killa Bees was supposed to have a hint of honey which I did not taste at all.  The crust of the pizza was dissapointing it was slightly burnt. My other two friends ordered Tagliatelle and a La Rossa pizza with extra olives and mushrooms as well as the garlic bread to share. Garlic bread was not bad but not anything to write  home about. I got to try the tagliatelle and it was fresh and decent tasting but I would not order that. The La Rossa pizza was good but slightly burnt at the bottom as well.All in all, not sure what all the hype is about because I would not go back to this restaurant, there are many other better pizza places in Montreal. Sorry!"
/user_details?userid=S3KMGLJsbVMTy7-WXiIjjA,Steven O.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"Really enjoyed this charismatic pizza spot. Felt like an interesting cross between grandma's house and a New York street corner. A lot of character for sure. It was hard to order the ""Inglewood"" (tomate, fior di latte, basil, and Parmesan) considering the more interesting options, but sometimes classic is best. The dough was perfect, the pizza oven charred flavour was absolutely perfect, and there was a healthy dose of tomato sauce. Thought the service was pretty good. Glad I ate downstairs since service was pretty non-existent next door at Milky Way. The same ladies serving me up stairs showed a lot more warmth to their friends downstairs. I will say this though, the guys making the pizza should not have used their phones as much as they did considering how handsy they were with the ingredients. Never washed their hands after use either."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It is quite something to watch your neighbourhood change before your eyes. Seeing old places close and replaced with newer businesses that come in, changing the type of services and shops that are available close to home. In Pointe St-Charles, as more professionals move into the area, we are seeing more and more new options open up and with some serious backing behind them. One of the most recent is Fugazzi Pizza. Located on Centre street across from Knox and close to the Nordelec building, Fugazzi is from the Barroco group - owners of Barroco, Foiegwa and the Atwater Cocktail Club.Fugazzi took over the old Irish pub that was once there and completely changed it into a weird homage to the 90s and kitsch. Lots of bright colours, neons and jagged shapes all over the walls and decor. I was partial to the wall with an old VCR and tube TV under an multicolour shark. Paired with the 90s music playing over top, it is weird but yet it works in the space. Food-wise, Fugazzi is going for Italian with a focus on Neapolitan style pizza. Our first appetizer was the citrus salad with fennel, pistachios and bottarga. An interesting available option that doesn't quite fit the vibe of the restaurant but one that was quite enjoyable. Very subtle and light - very fresh and citrusy. A good start for sure.Our other appetizer was homemade mozzarella sticks served with tomato sauce and horseradish. Honestly, probably the best I have had in years. Very flavourful with a wonderfully thick and crunchy outer coating. The use of horseradish to pair with the tomato dipping sauce was interesting and pretty good - provided some strong heat, if you desired, with the creaminess of the cheese stick.As main courses, since Fugazzi is supposed to be a pizza place, we decided to go with a couple of their pizzas. In classic Napolitean style, they are individual-sized pizzas although you can order larger ones for take-out. My friend went with the One Night in Paris - tomato, ham, olives, gruyere, button mushrooms, egg - and I went with the Wu Tang Killa Bees - tomato, calabrese, honey, thyme oil, mozzarella. Great names by the way. There are more and more Napolitean-style pizzas being served in the city so we can start to compare nicely between them. In this case, the pizzas were fine but not the best we had have. The crust had the right thickness and chew you look for but frankly both were too charred underneath for our liking and that impacted the taste. Ingredients were plentiful but nothing really wowed us. This is a solid idea of a pizza but not one I will be running for.We also tried to go up to the cocktail bar they build upstairs afterwards - Milky Way - but at 8:45 on a Thursday, there was already a wait list! Not quite something I am used to in my neighbourhood and frankly not really a great thing either but it speaks to the hype that exists around this opening. I am happy to have a pizzeria like this near home for the variety it provides. It is not a run-to for me but as someone who wants to see more businesses succeed in my neighbourhood, I hope they continue to work on becoming a better and better pizzeria.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=coPgr06MnwkTHLJmFzm80g,Daniel B.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,Visited for a late dinner. Most enjoyed the meatball appetizer. The marinara was fresh and somewhat sweet. Ordered the Wu Tang Killa Bees pizza and ricotta gnocchi to share two ways. Both were good although not spectacular. Wish the honey would've been more pronounced on the pizza. Portion size of the gnocchi was not very generous. What upgraded the experience was the great service. The team was attentive and polite. Appreciated the little touches such as wiping down of the table after the meal.

The pizza isn't bad by Montreal standards but it's not good. Cheap cheese. The crust was inconsistent - from burned to uncooked. The restaurant itself is weird. Looks like they were going for college town alternative style like in Austin or something. skateboads on the wall etc.. But the crowd isn't really very collegey. We walked in to a senior citizen being a creep to a waitress about her age. There are as many staff members as seats for customers."

Both pizza were very tasty. Their dough has good texture and pizza topping blend well together. I especially like the carbonara. The pasta was made with fresh made pasta and cooked perfectly. It was so good that we ordered a second order. For desert, some ordered coffee and some ordered old fashioned cocktail. Who say we cannot drink during lunch?
