/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"On a random night, the boyfriend and I decided to get some cheapie bites. Since it was 9:30pm on a Wednesday, most restaurants or shops are already closed since we live in the east end. Luckily, we found Super Taco on Yelp and decided to drive over there. Boy, was that a good decision!Good: The food was prepared quick, I had called in advance to let them know I will be coming in to make a take out order and they were nice about it. We also found out that on Wednesday, it's $1 taco night (but you have to order 4 of the same at a time)! BEST DOLLAR TACOS, especially if you're going on a budget. I had the vegetarian one and it was really tasty with the perfect stuffing to tortilla ratio. I think 3 orders between two people is sufficient, but if you're going to pig out, $1 taco is the night! Othewise it's $5 for 4 tacos on regular days.Bad: The take out sauce packets come in little plastic craft bags so it's a bit messy to serve, but it's not a deal breaker. The pork taco was a bit dry and slightly underseasoned, so I wouldn't be ordering that again. Also, they actually close at 9:45pm, despite the hour written at 10pm.Bottom Line: 10/10 would recommend a friend, it's as good as the street tacos I've had in Mexico."

Despite high Google ratings my experience here was just satisfactory.  The tacos here were small and quite dry--both the tortilla and the meat. The quantity of pastor with pineapples was very scant and I found the flavor kind of tasteless. I don't quite remember the taste of the chorizo tacos.  The guacamole wasn't memorable either. The food looked better than they tasted... At least in my photos :p I know there's the authentic experience but the restaurant didn't feel as clean as I'd like. But, its not an expensive dining experience. For two orders of tacos, Jarritos soda, guac and beans it came to around $30 if I recall. I wanted to like this place but it was underwhelming for me unfortunately."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,This was our last stop of our taco food run in the area and it was by far the weakest find. Given the comments in my group and the trend of recent reviews it seems there has been a change of ownership and the quality provided by the establishment is not what it used to be...We went with some chorizo tacos since they were all out on some other options and found them quite underwhelming. The price-tag for 4 tacos was super cheap but at some point there's a limit of what a taco should look like. Tiny tortillas with barely enough meat & ingredients to go beyond 2 bites. Real basic thrills with dry chorizo. Huge step down compared to other options in the area.
/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So super taco wasn't my first choice. I wanted to order from roi du taco however their delivery service wasn't available. The prices are cheaper than roi however the portions are smaller. We ordered guacamole and nachos, Soft Shell Tacos - Beef and chicken and a burrito. Since it's take out I thought the shell fillings would come separate however this was not the case. I found the packaging of the food to be a little flimsy. Specially considering the covid19 situation I thought it could have been packaged more securely. For example we had pieces of lime just thrown in the bag over the tacos. Kinda gross. Overall it was just okay. The guacamole was missing salt. The nachos were alright. The tacos were a little dry and the burrito was way too salty. Actually the Burrito was quite nasty. It was also the smallest burrito I've ever seen. All this considered, rather disappointed and I don't think I'd order from here again."
/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Stopped in for an afternoon bite. I had the 4tor5.00 taco. The mini tacos have a nice flavor and quite simple. Both the beaf and beaf tong are good. The tong is just more tender obviously. There spicy source gives it flavor and a nice kick. The service was quick (well the place where as empty) and friendly. Don't expect to full with or even two orders. I'd go back and try the choices in the menu.

/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Service is sweet and food came out decently fast. But I'm rating on food. I had the 4 for $5, Tacos are basic and not that great tbh. I had the pastor tacos which is pork and pineapple, meh. Burrito was bland and textually was all smush because it's just beans and meat. Their hot sauce is spicy but I wish they gave a spicy and mild one to balance the two.Overall, I wouldn't return and would not recommend. I'm still in search for my to go taco joint and this is definitely not the place for me."
/user_details?userid=2QzBGEF_INAbV0yewmxUjA,Jp R.,"Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,"I usually reserve 4-5 stars to top restaurants but I give it this rating for what they do. This is a taco joint and you get what you come from. Tasty, simple and effective tacos. Nothing out of the ordinary but on the traditional side of things. I come often because it's great and the staff is lovely. Plus my son loves it!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"Ok so this calls out for an update. I was here recently with some friends for some tacos, we also splurged and got some gorditas and a burrito. Everything was going fine, the el pastor tacos were as totally delicious as I'd remembered and the service was low key but charming, and the place was as haphazard looking as I remembered.And then a parrot flew out from the kitchen and landed on the back of an unsuspecting customer. She stayed remarkably cool as the owner/chef came up, told her the bird was friendly, then picked it up and put it on his shoulder. Later the bird walked around on the tables. We kind of just stared and tried to keep our shit together and then laughed all the way home and hoped not to get bird flu. I mean in other news, the burrito was a little heavy and bacony, the gorditas were greasy and delicious, and we ate piles of food for a totally wildly affordable sum. I dunno. Just seems a bit crazy to have a freaking bird walking around a restaurant. I just don't know what to do with that."
/user_details?userid=5JkrkzDxJ9U19dqY4_LQSg,Mike D.,"St-Leonard, Canada",3 star rating,"I tried this place today for a nice lunch, I walked into the small resto and it had a nice Mexican authentic feel to it. The menu is very limited ,I took the 4 tacos for 5$, I took the chorizo and it was very flavourful but I was sort of taken back by how small they were, the size of your palm, but they tasted great. They put 2 sauces in the table and there both spicy, I suggest u be careful with them if your not into spicy food.I was still hungry after the 4 tacos so I took a burrito, it had meat cooked with pineapple, the name doesn't come to mind but it was also very good. I also took a lemonade, tasted homemade, not to sweet very refreshing. The service was quick and efficient, and they were very friendly. I enjoyed it, I will try it again."
/user_details?userid=bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,Thea V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was craving tacos so my boyfriend and I decided to visit this place. The staffs were very welcoming and friendly. We decided to order carnitas(pork), cabeza(beef's head), lengua(beef's tongue) and chorizo with piña and guava jarritos. You get 4 tacos (same meat) for $5. The tacos were so good ! My favourite one is the carnitas, juicy and tender pieces of pork topped with onions and you have a choice between two sauces. They're both equally spicy but I preferred the green one which is slightly tastier than the red one.Wish I tried the churros but I didn't realize they have them til I was driving home. We will definitely visit again ! Thank you Super Taco!"

You will be back again and again and again guaranteed!"
/user_details?userid=mVRKwa4Ch4HSiEJ0KPRMIQ,Freddy G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great Tacos at a Great price. Service is very friendly and fast. If you're shopping in the area. Stop by for some tacos.
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was on my way to run errands and realized I hadn't eaten all day, so I went there to get a gordita con todo for $5, it did not disappoint. Filling and so flavourful, the meat was well seasoned and the cilantro and onions were just the right amount to balance it all perfectly. The girl who worked the front that night was so nice and service was fast. There's many places that do tacos in the area, but these ones will charge you more for a gordita and it won't be as good as the one from Super Taco (FKA Impactaco)."

/user_details?userid=_OkEXLN_5T9cMc3UFrLT9A,Lily A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Stumbled up on this place looking for a bite to eat in the area and they had everything I needed. Cheap flavourful tacos and friendly service. I had no idea they were closing and when I offered to leave they offered a menu item instead. The tacos came quickly accompanied by their delicious salsas at varying levels of hotness. Came back a year later with the BF and was impressed!
/user_details?userid=Hffqre-X6CVVq48t_fWtmA,Camille R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is one of our go-tos. The tacos (especially the al pastor and chorizo) are delicious! Service is great and friendly, prices are good, and the tacos are (according to my latino boyfriend) very authentic. The terrasse in the summer is also very lovely. Makes for a wonderful lunch.Strongly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Like most, I visited Super Taco (FKA Impactaco) for $1 tacos on Wednesdays (regular price is $5 for 4). Was not disappointed! They've since changed owners but quality has not suffered. With the increased popularity of taco joints around the city where else can you get tacos at this price? PS the other items are yummy too."
/user_details?userid=16XDM4M2G8NvLVLLOhM1nA,Sandrine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My favorite place for authentic cheap tacos. Al Pastor is the best and they have a small terrasse in the summer. Service is super fast and food great, fresh."
/user_details?userid=gSPU2bmXTvp4mD5zinl2_Q,Nicolas L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Tacos are small but so affordable. I would recommend the tongue or vegetarian. If you want to spend a little more get the ford it's! The sauces that they serve you at the table are HOT so watch out!The atmosphere is relaxed. Futbol is always on in the corner, the kitchen is fully visible behind the register, and the servers are very sweet and polite. Fun place to come on any night of the week to enjoy a small meal"

/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Was walking in the neighborhood and had started to build a little appetite. Well lucky for me, thanks to the bookmarks on my handy Yelp app, I saw that I had a few places nearby that I had been wanting to check out. The difficult part was deciding between Los Planes and Super Taco, but eventually settled on the latter, as my quest to find a respectable taco in this town continued (I'm coming back for you Los Planes!). Super Taco is small and cute, and we caught them during a slow time, easily finding a nice window table. The have a few things on the menu, but we were focused on tacos, of which they have a sensible deal for four (tacos) at $5. If you do so happen to get one of these plates, you can only pick one filling, so I went for the carnitas (with an horchata - tasty!) while she went for the al pastor (with a pineapple Jarritos soda). The tacos, as with all the tacos I've had so far in Montreal, only feature one tortilla (where I'm from - California - tacos usually have two). That said, the meat was tasty, especially with the salsa verde y rojo provided by the very nice server. Of course, a couple of our tacos fell apart because why? That darned one tortilla thing. Nevertheless, the price point, taste, ambience, and kind service won us over I'd say. Definitely coming back."
/user_details?userid=xnQ3ZT7XIh7NdzfWJTLsUQ,Vito C.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"A quaint little spot for authentic Mexican food. The menu is very basic. The food is good, but there's better soft-shell tacos out there. The prices are excellent if you are on a small budget. $5 for 4 tacos. and everything else is around $6. Good and affordable."

I was welcomed warmly and invited to sit out on the patio, which was surprisingly cool on this hot, humid day.Four tacos for $6 plus a Mexican grapefruit soda = one perfect summer lunch. My food came really quickly and was served with a mouth-on-fire (SO GOOD) salsa verde.It's not the most elegant of places but the food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly, and I got to read the paper en español.I've got to go back and try the tongue next time."
/user_details?userid=_CcLV9kTqfJPZWJs63hMKw,Luis G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've been living 7 years and this the best place by far for Tacos in Montreal. I recommend the Pastor (Marinated pork) or the Tongue tacos with some Chipotle salsa.

They come with roasted pineapples like they do in Mexico. You feel transported to east LA or the mission. You can't beat 4 tacos for $6. Now these are how tacos need to be. They got it down but they need to get beers in there!

I went to the bathroom and its HORRIBLE!!!! also you thinks you are getting a good deal but the tacos are sooooooo tiny that you end up eating 10 so isnt as cheap as you think it is. They dont have beer, who doesnt  love a beer with tacos???? there are way better taco places in Montreal."
