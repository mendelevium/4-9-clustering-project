The portion is generous and my friend can barely finish half of it.The service is fast as well. The bowl is about 17$. Not cheap but for the portion and its taste, I think it's worth it. Will come back again. We could also see the Leonard Cohen's wall painting from the terrace"

They are patient and if you don't understand the menu, just asked them; they're gonna reply with a happy face. The ingredients are really fresh and delicious. I'm going to come back."

Lots of variety here and they have an awards program too.The fish are well marinated and they pack a lot of rice and whatever condiments you want. Healthy and it's delicious.
/user_details?userid=GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Lovely little place right across from the Montreal Museum of Art, so this place was where I had my lunch break from art. This was also the first time I ever had poké which I think is ridiculous because I left the country just to have this. Poké, a Hawaiian specialty is ""American"" food (thanks to our neo-imperialism/colonialism hidden by our forced annexation of Hawaii as a state of the United States, but that's another thread for another time I suppose!) so you can sort of see the humor in leaving the United States to have it in Canada.Anyway! The ingredients were fresh, the food was plentiful though I could always eat more than I should (which I shouldn't!), and I could use my American credit card here (which is an absolute God send). The restaurant is like any other poké restaurant, as you customize your bowl with the ingredients you want (think Subway or Chipotle)."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Poke the right way is Poke my way.I'm a picky eater so the fact that this places gives you the opportunity to make your own bowl is the highlight.1. You choose your base (White rice, brown rice, quinoa)2.Choose between lots of fish options (salmon, tuna, etc)3. Choose six add ons4. Choose your sauceAfter that they add sesame seeds and fried onions if you want.They make them quick and all the ingredients tasted fresh. I got mine with carrots, avocado, mango, kale, pineapple, sesame seeds, fried onions, and salmon.So delicious and considering Poke bowls are very popular right now, this is a good place to get one. Prices are very reasonable for the portion and if you compare them to the other poke places it's the same except you can choose what you want exactly. The restaurant is also clean and spacious with a cool chill vibe. They also have a tiny terrace in the summer!"
/user_details?userid=TZBIjCMQ684ZtNMXpoFeyQ,Marzena F.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,Tried the poke today.Wasnt too impresse as i could not finish my bowl due to bland flavour.Everything is fresh but they dont mix the bowl so your vermicelli on the bottom is very plain and the bowl (to stay) is not large enough to mix your ingredients because its so full (they are generous on the addins) You get one scoop (ice cream scoop size) of protien.Upside it is healthy. Maybe i need to try a different bowl.I got a bottle of icetea plus the bowl was just over $20.

Plus, the price is very reasonable for the quality and portion sizeI branched off to get a table on their front patio, so I can't comment on the customer service and ordering process. I'm glad to say that this fast-casual poke joint has a great space off the main front sidewalk, which makes it grand for soaking up the sun and fresh air while people watching.Since we were coming off a food-high from a walking food tour, sharing a bowl was ideal. I love salmon, so we went with the Maui: Salmon, Mango, Avocado, Onions and Lettuce over a bed of rice. Had a lite citrus dressing tossed over everything. The bowl was awesome! Great flavors melding together. The salmon was fresh and melt in your mouth. The fresh veggies were crisp and cold Avocado was ripe as hello. Super huge giant ice cream scoop of healthiness! The presentation of the bowl makes me think ""Organized Chaos"" at its best! Highly recommended, folks!!"
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"My husband and I went here for dinner recently and we loved it! I checked Yelp before we went and it looks like they have changed a few things. They didn't have a paper that you fill out what you want, so you have to tell staff (more environmentally friendly this way; I approve). Also there is no longer a $1.50 charge for avocado, pineapple or mango. Toppings are also limited to 6, above that you pay $0.50 per additional topping. Vermicelli and Israeli Couscous are no longer available as bases, but Quinoa is now available. Since they are relatively new, I guess they are making changes to find out what works best for their business.So there are set bowl combinations you can order with cute names like Mahalo (which is the Hawaiian word for 'thank you"") and Aloha. Or you can build your own bowl. The price of your bowl depends on the protein you choose and whether you stay below the 6 toppings limit or not.Both my husband and I built our own bowl with shrimp and 6 toppings ($12.99). I got the brown rice base, with carrots, kale, broccoli, mango, cucumbers and avocados. I got the Ginger Ponzu sauce on the side. My husband got the quinoa base, with bean sprouts, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, mango, pineapple and carrots. He got the Teriyaki sauce mixed in.So at the end, you can get taro chips or fried onion pieces added to your bowl for free. I chose the former and my husband chose the latter.On the day we were there they also had free miso soup and free tea. If you wanted miso soup the staff give you a bowl filled with corn kernels, shredded carrots, bean sprouts and green onions, then you get your own broth from a container that looks like a coffee dispenser. The free tea the day we went was mint and mango tea (self serve from a similar looking container).I loved my poke bowl. The ingredients blended together really well and the portion was large. I liked having the sauce on the side so I could control how much I put in. I don't like too much sauce or dressing on my food though. My husband had his sauce mixed in and he didn't find it over-sauced or too wet. I loved the taro chips!! So crispy and delicious. The brown rice was slightly sticky, just the way I love it. All ingredients tasted fresh and I loved how finely the kale was chopped. The avocado was added at the end with an ice cream scoop. This was perfect as mixed in it would be all mushy.The miso soup was satisfactory. The broth was weak in flavour and not all that hot in temperature. Great for free, but I wouldn't buy it. The tea on the other hand was fantastic! It was pre-sweetened and so full of mango flavour. I would definitely buy it.Decor is cute with Hawaiian paraphernalia. Staff were nice.I would definitely return. Can't wait to have poke here again!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I enjoyed my poke bowl this time. I had the aloha with salmon, brown rice, spicy mayo and sesame seeds. I added seaweed to my bowl. There was a lot of small of salmon and they were cut up in little cubes. It was tasty and fresh. The aloha also has carrots and cucumber and edamame. It was very filling. I also got the mint and chlorophyll kombucha. So refreshing!! I recommend it! I had the poke delivered to my work through foodora and also ordered for 12 other people. Those who ordered spicy mayo got spicy mayo and those who ordered another type of sauce such as the classic or ginger ponzu sauce got NO SAUCE!!! I felt so bad for my four colleague who got a poke bowl without sauce because it was so dry!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I used to love this place but the food is not as great as before. I always take the same bowl: with salmon, white rice, various toppings and half classic half spicy mayo. The bowl is now drenched in sauce  and it makes everything way too soggy. The salmon doesn't taste as fresh as before. After having amazing poke bowls in other cities, it's sad to come back to your hometown and not be able to find a good one. As for the service, the guys were nice and the service is fast. The place is clean."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Located near Concordia University, this place is one of the numerous Poke places that have opened over the past few years. Having tried this place first, I could not compare it with other places yet. However, having been to Hawaii before, I could offer some hindsight about this Poke!Went there for dinner on a weekday, and the place had a good amount of people there. How it works, you go to the counter and choose your mix of poke. They offer a few premade mixes, which I recommend if you are not feeling too adventurous. For myself, I decided to go for my own mix, which came out good thankfully. You get to choose one base of carbs (white rice, brown rice, or quinoa), then you choose your toppings and sauce. For the food itself, the first few bites were enjoyable, but for some reason, by halfway, it became a chore to finish it. The flavors were good at first but got very bland afterward. The variety of flavors were not present, unfortunately. Overall, this would be a good lunch place, but I won't be coming back every day. Only when I have a craving."

/user_details?userid=WXgFEaQQ-YJag55nTN9r1Q,Eve D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I recommend Le Poké Bar to all of my friends and family, mainly because poke bowls are so damn good and a lot of people have never had the chance to try one. I've brought my mother and my fiancé here on two seperate occasions to try their first bowl, they both fell in love instantly! Based off my experience, I feel that Le Poké Bar serves the best poke in town (super fresh, great selection of toppings and lots of room for customization), on top of really great service. The employees behind the bar are all super helpful and very patient (I tend to take a while to decide on my toppings lol), every experience I've had with ordering here has been a good experience. Bonus: When I went on my birthday, I got a free vegan donut ;) They really care about their customers!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"With the current Hawaiian Poké frenzy of raw seafood dishes going viral in Montreal businesses, Le Poké  Bar is one of the first of its kind to oopen up . Tucked into the basement on Crescent- everything is simple-decor, menu, fast food seating.  You pick your base of seafood/protein on a bed of rice or pasta and select toppings. I ordered the Shaka- a base of shrimp with vermicelli topped with avocado, pineapple, onion, lettuce- priced at 15$ range. I didn't feel the flavours had anything unique in taste about the dish - but a good lunch pit stop option or in the go with the rest of the restaurants on Crescent."

The concept of making your own bowl seemed nice too! However, it just didn't meet my expectations.There was a good portion of everything except the salmon, which was disappointing. They should definitely put more. Overall, the meal just tasted bland. I even picked the spicy sauce but it was just flavorless. I find it too pricy for what you get. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't go back."

After one time trying, you will become a fan and will go there again."
/user_details?userid=Gnkq84PL6E5dYdhJvruAAw,Roxane A.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Some of the best Poke in town! Poke is one of the hipster trends I hope stick around. Le poke bar offers a few signature bowls but you can also design your own. The tuna and salmon always taste fresh and there is a large variety of toppings and dressings to choose from. I was pleasantly surprised to find kale in one of the predesigned bowls but i will definitely be ordering it again! All the bowls are very filling and I recommend getting quinoa if you're looking for a lighter option. Nothing better than enjoying your poke bowl on the lovely terrasse outside! Overall totally worth the $$
/user_details?userid=hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,Alina M.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited on a weekday peak lunch hour and was fairly pleased at the efficiency and speed of the whole process. It took around say 10 minutes to put my order together and everything, so I wouldn't worry too much about the time aspect. In terms of the menu/toppings options, there's quite a variety of them and they do seem fresh. I chose the custom made bowl with salmon ($13.99 + tax). Yes, it is a little higher than an everyday lunch, but it was very filling and frankly, the size was a little too much for one lunch. The decor/environment of the place was so cute and refreshing though and everyone behind the counter was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic!They have ~20 seats inside the store and a few seats outside, but I'd say that most of their customers take away the poke anyways."
/user_details?userid=lhqNrV_ZqbF22MV0tDVobw,Melanie H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I used to come here a few years back and the place was delicious! I just came back the first time in a while, the prices increased, and the quality and portions decreased. There is barely any salmon, avocado and mango. The taste of the Maui bowl is overpowered by cabbage and green onion. The rice is over cooked. And if you have a chance to taste the salmon, you'll notice it doesn't have much flavour. I'm sad to see that the place was not able to maintain the quality it used to."
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I read some reviews before going there, and since a lot of people complained about the portion being too small, I did not have high expectations. BUT, what the hell lol the staff were EXTREMELY generous when they were preparing the poke bowls: they really were trying to give you the maximum of each ingredient. To be honest I could not finish my bowl, all the ingredients were stacked super high hahaI customized my own bowl with salmon as the protein, and had avocado, masago, lettuce, seaweed salad, carrots, and mango as add on. The sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds were free. All that for only 13.99 is seriously as bargain. Everything was super fresh, and the sauce was on point. I think that one bowl is enough to share for two tbh hahaThe interior looked clean, and the color scheme does remind you of Hawaii. Staff were friendly. Nothing to complain. Gonna come back for sure."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As soon as I heard about this place, I started planning my visit. Raw fish and tons of delicious vege additions?? YES PLEASE.I first came here on a date with my SO and was literally jumping out of my skin from my excitement. I wanted to say ""ONE OF EVERYTHING"" when asked what my order was going to be. Instead, I opted for one of their salmon specials with mango over a bed of brown rice. I enjoyed the first few bites, but must admit that I didn't like the rice much, so naturally, the next time I went, I chose to go carb free and turn this into a salad experience (you can choose from noodles, brown/white rice, quinoa, or no carb). The next time, instead of going with one of their specials, I went for an a la carte experience where you choose your base, your fish, and then your toppings. Again, going with salmon, I created what I thought was going to be a phenomenal salad topped with a ginger dressing, and dug in excitedly. I have to say that this time around, I wasn't as impressed. Something seemed...lacking. Don't get me wrong here. The food is all VERY fresh but something about the lettuce and the overall flavor of the dressing was off. The lettuce was cut into long spaghetti like strands that seemed to be soaked in water and had a strange flavor...the salmon portion was far from generous, and the whole thing seemed like a flop for $17.Is the concept good? YES. Is the food fresh? YES.Is it affordable? YesWorth the money? Not sure..Will I go back? Only if I have to.Sorry Poke Bar, but I'm not as excited about you as I thought I'd be! :("

I was happy with the spicy tuna bowl I ordered here, everything was fresh and well picked. Only thing was it's a bit pricy. But yea, it's tuna and salmon so...Service was pretty fast, you order at the counter and go sit. I'd recommend this spot, especially if you feel like grabbing something quick. Very convenient and good location."

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On one of my highlights from our trips to Hawaii is always the poke so I was pretty stoked to recently learn that a poke place had opened in Montreal. I then read some of the other reviews on yelp and was worried that I may be disappointed. But I was not going to be deterred by a few reviews, this was poke that we're talking about afterall. Our experience at Le Poke Bar was great and will be definitely be back for more.  We were served by the two staff that were working at the time, both were super friendly and very helpful. We had the Mahalo and the Maui which were both great. The serving size was generous and the ingredients high quality and very fresh. The total bill after tax, but before tip, came to $33 which I thought was reasonable. All in all I really enjoyed the food and I will be back again soon to try some of the other bowls!"
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been hearing a lot about Poke lately, so of course when I heard that a restaurant dedicated to this dish would open in Montreal, I had to be one of the first to try... It opened 24 hours ago and I'm already a fan, even if following a non-scheduled customer traffic, I had to wait a while for my order (which is totally normal, you have to give them time to adjust). The Poké Bar is decorated with taste, painted with a soothing blue and very modern. I ordered the Maui Poke, which is made of raw salmon, mango, red onion, salad and avocados (I've added white rice to mine). I also ordered a dessert made of lime and pineapple. It all tasted very good. I was welcomed with smiles and they have apologized for the unexpected delays, you can feel that a lot of work has been put into this project. I would recommend this place to everyone."

/user_details?userid=kaij8B6O_up-NdLylOuWcg,Samantha W.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"Very nicely designed restaurant. Very clean and looks great. The tuna was very fresh and looked beautiful. I was a little disappointed that I was limited to 6 toppings and that cilantro, green onion etc counted as a topping so of course I opted for other things such as carrot, avocado, mango etc for toppings and then it ended up being kind of bland. I had the original sauce which was soy with sesame. Would've been nice to mix with another sauce. There was too much rice for me personally and it was kinda dry.It was good because everything was so fresh and could've been really great if there was more flavour."

Got a massive, and I mean MASSIVE bowl of poke and tucked right in. The fish tasted like cold water and the vegetables, were equally bland, all I could taste was the very salty sauce. Fast forward 30 minutes later, my stomach was experiencing the cramps from hell, cramps that could down an elephant. There is no way that I would come back here. I love the concept, but the execution, not so much, plus it's expensive for what it is: a few pieces of fish, sauce and veggies and rice."
/user_details?userid=_6CTDWsw4Fdr6R9ZzKvLZQ,Irene C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is my first time being impressed by a poke bowl. I've had poke bowls a couple of times in Toronto and I was always left dissatisfied with both the taste and the portion size. This poke bowl is worth the $20 I paid. I was stuffed. The amount of fish was substantial as we're the toppings and rice. I got a custom bowl which usually comes to about $16 and includes 1 base, 1 protein, 6 toppings and your choice of sauce. I added an extra topping for $0.50 and a half scoop of tuna/salmon tartar for $3. I chose a brown rice base, salmon, extra tuna/salmon tartar, kale, mango, avocado, masago, seaweed salad, fried onions, edamame, and sunflower seeds (which are free), mixed with the ginger ponzu sauce. To be honest I couldn't really taste the sauce but there were enough flavours mixed together in the bowl that I didn't mind.Only negative comment is that I thought the fish and the avocado could have been fresher. You could see the avocado starting to turn brown, which I guess is difficult to stop when it's out in the open. I also thought service could have been better. The server seemed impatient and the want even a line. It was my first time there and I want familiar with the toppings but he didn't offer to explain them. Other than that, I'd recommend this if you're looking for a quick and healthy meal option."
/user_details?userid=PZyVNXvsNPrLSxD-30_6aA,Kamila S.,"Prague, Czech Republic",2 star rating,"I was very excited to try this poke bar, but am honestly a bit disappointed. That may be because I'm comparing it to a poke bar in Los Angeles, but still that poke bar was basic in appearance though delectable in flavor.Anyhow, the choice of base is limited - nothing like kale noodles or any type of Asian noodle for that matter. Also, the choice of protein is limited - no spicy tuna or slightly seared albacore, my favorites. You can also choose only one whereas during my previous pole bar experience I could choose a combo of two.Though this poke bar boasts a variety of toppings, they don't have pickled cucumber which is the absolute bomb in a poke dish. Further, and I am absolutely appalled by this since Montreal seems to be such a progressive city as concerns things natural and organic, the ginger is bright pink with artificial additives!!! This to me sends a message about how the restaurant cares about procuring top ingredients and cultivating a truly positive dining experience.Okay, I am on the last of my complaints: I was not taken away by the ginger ponzu dressing. It really didn't add much flavor or juicyness.My experience in LA was mouth-wateringly good, whereas here I just ate some food lumped into a bowl, with none of the aspects that really create a sensational melding of flavor."

Try creating your own poké bowl option - it's fun and you can add as many toppings. I had salmon with edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, carrots, coriander and brown rice, with the original sauce. The food was fresh and I thought it was good, especially for when you crave for a poké bowl. Have a San Pellegrino to go with your poke bowl - a great match ;) . I think I paid a total of $18 + tips.The service was decent and the place was spacious enough for a quick lunch. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and yes, I would come back again :)"

Once inside the place was filled with locals enjoying the tonnes of options here. Now the catch is that the menu is in French (no surprise as it's in the heart of Montreal). The guy working however picked up that I could only speak English and was very helpful in recommending. If you enjoy sushi you'll love the poke bowls. Brown rice, white rice both are great. The food was really great. Be sure to add the spicy sauce if you like spice. It's clean eating here for sure and highly recommended. The price does go anywhere between $15 bucks and up so with a drink you are looking at about $22 to $25 bucks all said and done. Overall great spot and lots of room to sit and enjoy."

I was excited to eat at the terrace but it's not really flat, but tilted to one side, and has gaps on the floor where the chair can get trapped! It was all made better by these little birds that came to visit my table! I was amazed that I was full half-way through my plate and got to take the rest home for dinner, I don't know if I was hungrier when I went to Koa Lua (post-work) than just now (lunch break) or if they are just significantly different in size.

I chose the personalized bowl w/ rice, salmon and 6 different toppings. I liked the different options possible and they employee was good at making sure you knew how many you had. Some toppings were heavy handed, others weren't. Place was clean and I liked how srirachia was at every table. Just FYI- if you like spicy food, the spicy sauce isn't spicy at the least. It was mostly mayo so if you don't like mayo, don't get it. I love mayo so I didn't mind. I poured at least another 2, 3 or 4 heaping tablespoons of srirachia on top which was fine.

We had ordered two different custom bowls, one with salmon and one with tuna, but they both came with tuna. We had ordered similar extras but not the same although the only difference in toppings was one had cucumber and the other did not which was the only thing they got right. There was not enough sauce and the bowl as a whole was pretty bland due to that. We also ordered smoothies, they were very sub-par. They don't taste very fruity, mainly like the liquid base used in the smoothie. We also got the chocolate avocado pudding and the only words we could think of to describe it were earthy and tastes like dirt. I have had many avocado-based chocolatey desserts and they should not taste like this! Overall, we were very disappointed because the food looked a lot better than it tasted. We haven't had poke bowls before so maybe it is good as far as poke bowls go, but for foodies who like flavour and tasty dishes, I would definitely stay away."

It's pretty simple! With that being done, you get a bowl that looks like it came straight from heaven. They are very generous with their portions and everything is fresh. They also offer miso soup (it's free!) with your poké bowl. I would definitely come back!"

It is similar to a fast food joint when you order - you pick your protein and add 6 toppings of whatever you want to your bowl. Don't be fooled it ends up being a mountain of food that makes you want to scream YAY. Prices range from $15-$20 for a poke bowl here!

Not a fan - I much prefer Buddha Station's execution in the ""raw bowl"" category. If you have to choose between either option in a delivery setting, I suggest picking Buddha Station.

/user_details?userid=OvkB2G-ZLhwocrIprjaYDw,Sara B.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"Long story short: the concept is fresh and the vibes are cool, but the service is bad and the food is really just edible. A poké bowl consists of a starchy base (they offer white rice, brown rice, Israeli couscous or noodles) topped with a protein (usually fish but smoked tofu and chicken are also available) and plant-based mix-ins. I decided to build my own bowl and selected chicken as my protein of choice. It was cold and dry and only made edible by slathering it in the avocado I thankfully also ordered. I definitely would not recommend it. Date 1 tried the smoked tofu in the bowl she built. It was nothing remarkable but definitely passable. Date 2 ordered one of their pre-designed tuna bowls. It was OK. Among the things it came with was kale and avocado. She asked to switch the kale for nori and ended up being charged extra for this, which was confusing because a) no indication had been given at any point that this would warrant an extra charge and b) aside from the avocado and fruit, all mix-ins are free when you build your own bowl. When we asked about the charge we got a strange and confusing answer about customers ""abusing the expensive ingredients"" that did not answer our question. Aside from the weird response, we were also surprised by the stone faced service of the ladies putting together our bowls. I usually don't comment on these kinds of things and never feel entitled to a smile- but this went beyond neutrality. It was like these girls wore disdain for customers as a uniform!  I really wouldn't recommend Poké Bar. While their portions were generous and their ingredients fresh, none of that matters if the end result is just passable food for unjustified prices."

The smoked tofu was flavourful and had a lovely texture mixed with the veggies.But today I was thoroughly disappointed to  hear from some fellow colleagues and Poke fans that they changed out the smoked tofu for an alternative. This is not an unusual thing since we have frequented the bar, the menu has been formatted and reformatted they had Israeli coucous for a while , then it was no longer available, the noodles wavered from time to time also.......I decided to take my chances and order my usual Kahuna bowl with tofu. Sadly the tofu was indeed over seasoned and so salty it left an unsavory salt burn on my tongue.Why change a good thing? There is plenty of flavour from the abundance of ingredients in the bowl, not to mention the tofu seasoning is contain din the majority of the sauces they generously add to the bowls. Trust me the smoked tofu was savoury but with balance.Anyway, please Poke just stick with the smoked tofu! damn it!!"

I built my own bowl and after one bite all I could think was how flavourless it was and that I can probably make a better one at home. The other positive that I would give them is their cool decor.

You basically can create your own bowl or pick a pre-made one. I went for white rice, tuna chunks, yuzu soy sauce, edamame, mango, avocado, carrots, cashews, red onions, pickled ginger, etc. You get a choice of 6 toppings from the veggie selection - it wasn't easy to choose! While it was yummy to eat and a fun experience sharing a bowl, it wasn't very filling (I split the bowl with someone else) and it needed more flavour (hence we were dousing it with sriracha). Will go back to try different combinations. About $17-18 per bowl if you make your own."

Below is how it works1. Choose your base2. Choose your protein3. Choose your sauce4. Choose your add onsWith so many options I decided to go with the Maui signature bowl which already comes with salmon, mango avocado, onions, and lettuce. To top it off we added quinoa and spicy mayo to the bowl. It made for a fresh, delicious, healthy meal. The proportion of the lettuce and quinoa can get dry once you run out of salmon and mangoes, but you can always add more sauce. Overall the portions of both the salmon and filler are quite generous and the ingredients were fresh. Inside there is a nice Hawaiin summer vibe and is nicely painted with Tiffany blue themed walls and seashell decor. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would come back"

/user_details?userid=dmN6SfMI-pQyT-ouOmEkjQ,Noor M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been to this place many times and I've gotten something different every time. I disliked the bowls I tried there because they go over the top with the fried onions that they cover the bowl with, some of the sauces are way too mayo-based and the toppings/base ratio is nearly always off. This time though I went for the build your own bowl option and it was much better, it was super satisfying and I would definitely consider it again if I'm in the the area for a quick lunch. So I recommend going for the BYOB rather than their custom bowls. All this aside, the servers are always really sweet and polite, and the decor of the place is pretty cool. It's in a super convenient part of town too, so if you're in the Concordia area it's good for a quick (half hour) lunch. They also do uber eats and take away!"

Good alternative if you feel like eating sushi but don't want sushi... The portion is huge but that is due to the amount of rice. It did not taste much, perhaps my choice of sauce (house) was not the best combo. I suggest the spicy sauce for tuna or you can add Sriracha yourself. You can also pick your ingredients and the friendly staff will put them together for you. Great service, fresh ingredients, good price."

The poke bar is the perfect place to grab a healthy but delicious bite. The poke bars are like carb salads with veggies on top. You get to choose a bowl and the sauce or you can create your own.I would say the portions are pretty comfortable but that depends wildly on who your server is. I would say my bowl was about 2/3 the size of my friend's just because we had 2 different people serve us. Overall the price range is okay for a fairly healthy lunch and an interesting concept. A good place to stop by if you like the idea of fish themed bowls. They have both cooked fish and raw fish options.

The seafood-centric Hawaiian bowl usually doesn't lend itself to vegetarianism. As soon as I saw tofu though I knew this was my chance to sample the poke craze. I got a tofu brown rice bowl with all kinds of green stuff. Husband did the opposite and mixed a bunch of meats with quinoa. We both got spicy mayo sauce. Food comes with a free miso based soup and pineapple tea. For dessert it was an avocado chocolate mousse with toasted coconut. Everything was 30$. Bowls were delicious and filling. Loved the place and the concept. Great staff and a very laid back vibe. Perfect after an afternoon enjoying art (fine arts museum is right across the street so you can make a day of it).

I paid a total of $22 for my bowl, but I think $15 would have been the fair price for what I got. I was disappointed that they didn't have sushi rice, but the brown rice was a great healthy alternative so I didn't mind. The fish was delicious and I loved all the choices for toppings. Pretty much everything I can imagine on my Poké was there. A lot of people have some harsh criticism towards this place, but I love it. The owner, Allen, is very hands on and you can see passion in his eyes when he talks about Le Poké Bar. I sat at the corner table and noticed he was checking every single table to see how satisfied all his guests are. Listening to good and bad comments. He cares for improvement as they've been opened for only a month. And I respect that.You can tell the employees work as a team. They were all very attentive and informative. Sure this place has a few things to tweak, but I'm very excited to continue visiting this establishment and see it grows.Will recommend to friends :)"

The bowls are colorful and fresh. In fact, the greatness of this place is in its simplicity: streamlined and uncluttered interior design, build-it-yourself ingredient bar and a short menu (if you don't feel like assembling a bowl). And whatever you do, you get a healthy meal: fresh raw fish (salmon or tuna), edamame beans, kale, avocado, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds with a choice of sauce (miso or soy-based, spicy mayo etc), and served on a base of Israeli couscous, white rice or vermicelli rice noodles. Sadly, brown rice was not an option.Only caveat, I found the price a bit steep (17$ for a bowl with a base of couscous, with a bit of salmon, some kale and avocado). Also, the bowls are one-size: no option of making it a small/med/large."

With tax most bowls are running in the $17 range - $15 is probably closer to what makes this an easier lunchtime decision for me rather than a ""treat."" One star off due to what has come across to me as simply very poor inventory management by the owners - I've been 3x so far and on two occasions (months apart), they've had handwritten signs with sad emoji faces announcing they're out of avocado, and once out of quinoa. Quinoa!!! It's not like this is an ingredient that breaks the bank, is perishable, or requires a massive amount of space to keep available.
