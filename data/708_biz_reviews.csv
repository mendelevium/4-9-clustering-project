The shawarma dinner arrived in a plastic container with 3 sections, one section has a cold creamy cole slaw, the other a nice garlic sauce and the largest had the chicken shawarma over rice and roasted potato and turnips, a pita bread was also included. The moussaka was in its own styrofoam container (are we allowed to use that word these days?).The food overall was very tasty and addictive although I was not a fan of the moussaka and perhaps I was expecting something resembling a Greek dish. The chicken was tender and no funny aftertaste (a pet peeve of mine), potatoes well seasoned and salted, the rice well cooked and also had a good flavour, add the garlic sauce and the food was gone before I could take a pic! I did not have the pita bread as it was too dry and hard to enjoy but these was enough food so I probably would not have eaten much anyway."

With winter, driving to the original location downtown was not an option. Such is life. This visits pros and cons: Pros: 1. Got my garlic sauce on the side. Thank you for this. Such a simple detail but makes a big difference (to me)2. Meal was freshly prepared right in front of me (I'll forgive the fries which were pre-made. They still tasted great. Cons: 1. The portions! My meat was one layer deep (the bottom was covered in potatoes - how convenient). This is a huge miss. At Â each plate costing close to 14 dollars what is going on guys? Is it just this location that is doing this or has Boustan really changed ? There's no need to skimp on shawarma meat. Which is essentially a mix of white and dark meat marinated and roasted on a spit. Good grief. I'll go back to the original location next time. I'm holding out hope it'll be better quality and quantity wise. We will see. Such is life things change and we move on."

Like very good. Make sure you ask for the hot sauce, made in house and awesome. Have to try the chicken shawarma plate next."
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The new location is nice looking and clean, plus they have AC. To celebrate their opening, they are offering $6 trios (beef or chicken wrap + garlic potatoes + soft drink or water) throughout August. The opening must have been stressful though, because one of the workers (who seem to be the manager) was being a bit aggressive to this lady who was his co-worker (and surprinsgly, not to the customers).It was not super busy or anything (at least in the late afternoon) so it's a good moment to go. They were very fast in preparing the food. The chicken wrap was tasty and so were the garlic potatoes! Their rice also looked delicious, but I did not try it because it was not included in the trio (soon though!)."

Tastier than another well-known chain, and stays open later, which is a big plus for late-night cravings.On the downside, when I went to the One on St-Hubert, it was frigid inside, and the lighting, oh the cold, ugly lights!Still, I'd return there any time since it's so good."
