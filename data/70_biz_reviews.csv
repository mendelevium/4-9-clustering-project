/user_details?userid=mTg2lrKJbC7e4EsTizV4aA,Lisa M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,My daughter and I visited on Tuesday evening. We were seated at the bar. Carlos the bartender was extremely helpful. We wanted a variety of dishes and left it to Carlos to decide for us. He didn't disappoint. Our only request was no beef. We started with specialty margaritas - Miss Paloma and Cilantro Smash - tasty and fun. We had mango salad and tuna tostado. We then had the Baja and pollos tacos. The flavours were all unique and delicious. We loved the flavour combinations. We finished off dinner with churros. So fresh. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. Thank you Carlos!We are in Montréal regularly and will definitely be back.
/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the better Mexican restaurants in Montreal. What makes this one unique is there tequila selection. Expected to spend little bit more $$, but you won't regret it (that's if you're a fan of quality tequila). Their tacos are excellent they have a great selection and the quality there. there has been some comments and I am one of them where I found the fish taco a little bit fishy, but that's just a type of fish. So if you're sensitive to the fish smell there are plenty of other selections.the prices are reasonable however it does add up fairly quickly so if you're at a birthday or you feel you might want avoid making too many calculations in your head just get the tasting menu. The portion is more than enough and you get the best bang for your buck."

There's Latin music playing, Mexican art on the walls, cute decor, and dimmed lights. I tried the Baja and Al Pastor tacos, they were both delish. I also had a michelada and my friend had a cocktail. My drink was pretty good, but my friend's cocktail was small. Staff was also nice. I think tacos could be priced lower for what it was."

Delicious, in fact my 10yo has never requested 2nd of the same meal, but she sure did with the Pollo Hermanos! Thanks Mike for the hospitality, very impressed! (PS: we didn't know reservations on a Wednesday was a thing, but they still got us in!)"
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",4 star rating,"Escondite is a good place for tacos if you're planning on getting multiple plates and making it more of a ""tapas"" thing.I had the chance to try this highly buzzed about restaurant 9 months ago. We were a group of 15 and made a reservation about 2 weeks before. They still managed to squeeze us into a tiny space that fit about 10 people usually. It was a very hot summer day and their AC was deficient for some reason so let me tell you we weren't extremely happy about that. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is very dark with beautiful paintings on the wall and some cool decorations around the bar, as well as in the bathroom. Yet again, everything feels squeezed and tight.The waitress was very nice and listening, she helped me with my choice since everything has cilantro in it and I cannot eat that. She was very patient, too bad I can't remember her name.The food is good. When you ask for spicy, it comes extremely spicy so be careful! The portions aren't very generous for the price, had to order churros at the end to feel like I had eaten enough. My friend and I split the ""ensalade de mangos"" as an appetizer, and then we had the ""Al Pastor"" and the ""Baja"" tacos but it still left us hungry. The drinks are delicious. I would definitely recommend the mojito del' king to share with friends.  Finally, the service was quick! We were a big group and after we ordered it took about 7-8 minutes to get our appetizers and not even 10 minutes later to get our food."

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Escondite does a great job of combining a fun vibe with quality Mexican food. While the food isn't pure perfection, it's pretty damn tasty and a good time is nearly guaranteed when you eat there. When I was a kid, Mexican food in Montreal meant Carlos (or Marcos) and Pepes; Americanized garbage....hard shell tacos filled with mystery meat, plates swimming in cheese and red sauces, heated and reheated in a microwave, and finished off with the requisite oversized frozen daiquiris and margaritas made from a mix. I'm not suggesting that Escondite is the most faithful representation of authentic Mexican food. Even they would admit that they take certain liberties. Nevertheless, we are miles away from generic chimichangas and sizzling fajita platters....and that's a good thing.I've eaten here 3 times over the last year and a half. Recently, we started the meal with the guacamole and the house made chips. While it won't change your life, it's a perfectly passsable home made guacamole. The house made chips are oversized and a little too crispy/hard. They are only mildly salted and spiced. Often, Mexican chips will be addictive. These are good for a few bites, and then you are ready to move on.The corn and jalapeño muffin is quite good, but should be served in a larger portion to share an order.They have a dish called nachos 2.0 which I consider to be ill conceived in every way. It's basically japanese gyoza dumplings topped as nachos. This is served in a small portion at a large price. I call complete BS on this dish. Someone might actually be in the mood for some great nachos, but they would be out of luck at Escondite. When done well, they can be life altering. Case in point: Lord William Pub in Griffintown. Check it out.Their mango salad is excellent and well conceived. Served with julienned mango slivers, peanut, and cilantro, this dish has the potential to be the perfect ratio of sweet, refreshing and savoury. Unfortunately, as my sister-in-law points out, 2 out of 3 times one orders this dish, it is prepared with mangoes that are not fully ripened. They ought to buy their fruit at National in Westmount. The problem would be solved.Where they really excel is their tacos. Served in pairs, the al pastor combines sweet pineapple with savoury pulled pork. The fish taco and shrimp/chorizo taco are both excellent. They charge extra for some salsa verde on the side. This ought to be included. Also, a few slices of lime would be nice.We ordered spicy margaritas which were delicious and strong. On previous visits, I had ordered the King mohito and found it to be very weak in alcohol content. (A bar can commit no greater sin than serving a weak cocktail. If a drink is going to cost ten bucks and up, there better be a decent amount of booze in it. Don't play games with ice, juices, and garnish.) I will give Escondite credit that on this last visit, service was excellent, and drinks were refilled quickly and often upon request.I finally tried their churros this time after passing on dessert on previous visits. Served with a Nutella like dipping sauce, the churros were tasty but overfried. The inside should be moist and soft with a crispy exterior. Instead, the whole thing was a bit of a crumbly mess.So why am I giving this place 4 stars when the review reads as a solid 3? For some reason, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Maybe it was the tequila shots, maybe it was the conversation. Maybe I was just hungry, and maybe I just enjoy eating here. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,"Another place that I've heard many great things and my bf went there (without me) and he loved it!This place is always packed. Went there for lunch with some colleagues and we got there 10 mins after the opening time (11:30) and the place was already full. We could only get seated at the counter tables which we didn't mind.The staff recommends ordering 2-3 items /person. We were 3 and ordered 6 items.Ordered a shrimp ceviche...thought it was missing some flavours...missing a punch element and the shrimps didn't have the crisp texture of freshness.We followed with some spicy chicken wings...wished they were also more crispy but flavour was good.After that we had 3 kinds of tacos. All were good but the one that stood out was the pork one with pineapple...the sweetness of the pineapple elevated the taste of the taco.Was hungry in between so also ordered a serving of tortilla chips with guacamole. Chips were good but he guacamole was a bit fade...a pinch a salt could have helped.All in all, good but not the best I've had."

The food is succulent. Great spices. I definitely recommend this place the only thing I would like them to change is the opening hours and services, that's why I'm giving a 4 star. There's a service that ends at 8pm leaving you the impression that you need to rush out. I like to take my time and enjoy my food with great company. But if I get there around 6:30-7 gotta hurry up and be done by 8. But for their excellent warm corn bread and jalapeño mojito, I forgive them."

This Mexican themed resto is decorated with beautiful art murals, dimmed lights, wood furniture and a very large bar. I went with a couple of friends and it was packed! We did make reservations in advance so we were quickly seated but know that the wait for would be long if none made. I had a mango drink, beet ceviche, baja taco and churros. Everything tasted great, service was good. The only disappointment was my ceviche; I was expected the salad to be cut up small but they serve these chunky pieces. I'm not sure if I'd go back because it was so overpacked and I found it difficult to communicate. The food was great though!"

It was downtown and we were able to walk it from the hotel. Make reservations! We arrive at 6:30pm on a Sunday, without reservations and the place was already jumpin'.  There were a few small groups ahead of us and the wait looked like it was going to be a long one. But we got lucky! Since it was only two of us, a table was available for a hour and a half so we snagged it. We weren't planning on hanging out for hours - although I could see why you would want to, the vibe was lively and casual atmosphere, great spot to have drinks with a small group of friends. The service was excellent and really fast. The food - we opted for tapas - was tasty - shrimp tocos and two soft shell tostadas. For dessert we opted for the key lime pie (not our fave) and churros.  It was tapas and we weren't hungry so the portions were just right. It hit the spot. Would definitely go back! If you're in Montreal with a small group and want Mexican food with a cool vibe, check it out (make reservations)"

Service was good but not too quick and I was getting a bit anxious as I was on a time crunch. Nevertheless, the food was great. I shared 3 different types of tacos with my partner; Baja (crispy cod, avacado crema, cabbage slaw, black pepper cream, radish, coriander), Al Pastor (pork al pastor with grilled pineapple, onions, coriander) and Pollos Hermanos (fried chicken, chipotle crema, corn bread croutons, avocado crema, iceberg, red cabbage). We loved all of them though our favourite was the fried chicken one and we ordered an extra order of that as we weren't full. Prices are fair though slightly expensive as the portions aren't too big. But the quality of the ingredients make up for it!"

/user_details?userid=6zsuSuLEwhUNHEWSDJqt-Q,Rohit A.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic tacos and drinks! This is as good as it gets. It's located near Square Philips. The decor is hip and trendy. There is a lot of graffiti on the walls.Makes you feel you're in a taqueria in Cartel territory. The tacos and the cocktails are first rate and very authentic in taste. They are a little pricey, but I would gladly pay for the taste every once in a while. The cocktails were priced 12-15$ and were potent and tasted great. The pollo tinga(order these if you like spice) and pollos hermanos were both great. The baja tacos were pretty bland (order these if you can't handle spice).The cocktail that we ordered(spicy margarita) was not on the menu. But was recommended by the server and it was great."

The space is much bigger, just as nicely decorated, creating a great ambience. We asked for the house margarita which we didn't see on the drinks menu-it didn't disappoint. Unlike previous visits to the other location, this time we opted for entrées rather than small plates...except for the best ever tortilla chips & guacamole. I had the quesadilla sincronizada de hongos (Sautéed mushrooms, black truffle paste,Oaxaca cheese, cheddar & garlic cream). It was delicious.  This remains one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal! It's a great combination of food drink ambience and service."

We ordered several dishes and ate family style. Each dish comes up fast so you can order to your order as you dine"

Glad she did as it was completely packed when we got there even on a Wednesday night! This spot has a really cool and hip vibe!! We started with the famous drink, Zorro. It had a unique flavour and was definitely worth trying. We ordered two types of Tacos to share. 2 Fish Tacos and 2 Crispy Chicken Tacos. Both were very good, but I liked the fish ones more. The guacamole served with the chips was authentic and delicious. Service was slow because of how full the restaurant was but we didn't mind waiting as everything was perfect otherwise!! Would definitely recommend this spot for an authentic Mexican experience."

Back in town and had to come back, longing for the vibe and food and drinks and is as good as I remember it!

Our server Bianca was soo friendly and attentive. She spent time going over the menu with us even though the bar and seating was extremely packed. We also did not have to wait for water or refills on our beer and margaritas. My husband and I were way too hungry to take pictures of our food but let me tell you, the best quesadilla we've ever had! They're made with truffle mushrooms!!! How can you not like truffle oil and mushrooms?? We also had the corn which is not the typical corn on the cob, it's corn kernels in a bowl which was also devouring. We ended up sharing tacos for our main course as we were so full from our apps. Ended up ordering the Tinga tacos on tostadas. Never thought I'd like a Mexican place this much outside of Mexico. A must ""go to"" spot if you're in Montreal!!"

I sat down at my favorite spot, the bar. The barmen were very friendly and very professional. I ordered a signature cocktail, the Zorro, soooo tasty! I had this drink with fish tacos, a chicken tao and as dessert a strawberry Jarritos (ok it is not a dessert but that's what I wanted lol) ... In short, I loved everything!

My fried chicken was a little dry but it was my only minor hiccup. The chips with the gauc had a chile seasoning that I really liked. The iced margaritas were on point and quite refreshing. The inside was cool looking with funky seating, wall art and an outdoor patio. The service was super nice and chatty. Def a place to go have lunch or dinner and worth it."

Visited for dinner this week and ordered the mango salad as well as their General Chapo as starters with 4 tacos to share (e'steak and pollo hermanos). I was SO excited for the food because the description on the menu was super yummy (that, and I was pretty hungry)! Unfortunately, my bubble of expectation was quickly burst with the mango salad. Expectation: deliciously cold, sweet, tart, and spicy all at once with various bursts of flavor in your mouth with every bite. Reality: flat, no dimension to the flavor, tasted like straight up mango. Rating 1.5/5 :(The General Chapo was brought next, and I hoped it would have been better but, alas disappointment hit me like a load of bricks once more. Expectation: deliciously crispy morsels of fried chicken coated in a yummy sauce that would mentally take me to the middle of Mexico on a cool summer's day. Reality: not crispy, loaded with some gunky sweet sauce, not delicious, and definitely didn't take me anywhere near Mexico. Rating: 1.5/5 :((I figured the tacos would be better and I was slightly right. The E'steak tacos were very generously portioned (read: lots of meat) and were well seasoned. The chicken tacos were DELICIOUS! Finally, a home run! I would have ordered a bunch more if we weren't in a rush to leave! Tacos 4/5.The service was great throughout our stay and the price wasn't bad ($50 for the above)! That being said, I'd only come back for the chicken tacos to be honest.

As soon as you walk into this restaurant, the first thing you'll notice is the decor. One of the more eye-catching decors. The spicy corn bread/muffin is a must try and the tacos are equally good. My fiancé is vegetarian and she really liked the cauliflower tacos and found enough options unlike some of the other restaurants.

The ribs were solid too, and the sticky sauciness of these two items together were pretty awesome.That said, service was questionable and seemed weirdly resistant to business. I came alone without a reservation, and they told me it would be a 20-40 minute wait to sit at the bar (which ended up taking 2-3 minutes when I said I would wait)... They also turned away couples without offering to put them on a wait list when tables were empty. I understand there may have been reservations, but they didn't seem like they wanted to accommodate them at all and in the end those empty tables sat empty for most of the time I was there. Also, beer selection terrible.$8.95 for a bottle of Sol, and $9.95 for a can of Tecate?The only beer on tap was Belgian Moon, Ricards Red, Dos Equis. Booooo. I understand Montreal isn't the biggest craft beer town, but the selection relegated me to the cocktail menu, which started at $11.95 - and I will say that the Acapulco Weekend was very tasty (although back to the service factor - I received this AFTER my food was delivered to my table).The quality of the food makes me keep this place at 4 stars despite everything else making me want to push down to a 3.

The service was good (the waiter made sure we always had water) and the vibe is very fun and vibrant with the graffiti walls.

Despite this, we were seated within 5mins. We started off with their guacamole with tortilla chips, which was delicious and well seasoned unlike most places. Next, we got the their quesadilla which mainly had cheese, and the baja (fried cod) and pollos hermanos (fried chicken) tacos! The quesadilla was really good, however it tasted more like a grilled cheese which is a little pricey for what it is (15$). The tacos were simply delicious! The cod and the chicken were fried perfectly and paired very well with their toppings. Don't forget to also try their drinks because they are worth a try! While some of the tapas may be a little pricey for their size, their dishes are delicious, especially their tacos and drinks. I would recommend make reservations since this place is quite popular and usually packed!---The tacos were so good I had to come back a second time during the same week! This time I tried the Al Pastor (pork belly) and Camarones et chicharon (shrimp and chorizo) tacos along with their mango salad! Once again, their food did not disappoint! The mango salad was a great way to start my meal and the Mojito Del'King paired very well with the food. Definitely coming back here often!!"

The venue was crowded as ever on a Saturday night; really enjoyed the great vibe and casual atmosphere. We were seated near the window on an uneven table (which was noted and fixed by the waiter) and some creaky wooden chairs over an old rug, but the yummy sangria pitcher made us forget it all! Seeing that we were having trouble choosing our plates, the waiter asked if we'd prefer the tasting menu, which I had no idea they offered, and for 30$pp it was so worth it! We started with mango salad, Mexican style General Tao chicken, corn bread with spicy butter, then came bbq ribs, and three kinds of tacos: pulled pork, steak, and cod. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few from the lineup but I was literally in a food coma; there was so much food, we didn't even finish our tacos. Best part, everything was delicious! Flavourful salad, succulent ribs, and the tacos were also delicious, perfectly topped and generously filled.  There was obviously no room left for dessert although the churros sounded so tempting. Will definitely try them next time cause I'm sooo going back! Kudos to our waiter Gabriel for the great service."

All the tapas small plates are excellent. Seasoning was great and spice levels perfect. Tacos were the only reason why my rating is not a 5. They could work on the tacos but everything else is great. Bathrooms need some love as well. Sanitizer needed!
/user_details?userid=mp9QGa6SXnllbcIebVEXjg,Saran P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I don't really fancy Mexican cuisine but I loved this Americanized Mexican food joint! Their Tapas : Alas de pollo( Maple and chipotle chicken wings) and corn bread was fantastic! Got to use my hands to finish off the wings though. We tried 3 Tacos:Mole (pulled chicken) Pollos Hermanos(fried chicken)Baja (cod)Mole is now my favourite taco in town!! The other two were just as yum. Amazing ambience and service! Would definitely come back for their wings and tacos! Two thumbs up!

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On Union between Ste. Catherine and René-Lévesque. If you find parking on Union, you're lucky - it's construction central right now. You may luck on either street above/ below Union but that'll depend on your timing. Check the meters for restrictions. The place: I love it. It reminds me of a humble beach shack that you'd find in Mexico or California. Escondite boasts a super cozy, warm vibe without any pretense. Dimly lit, wood, cozy seating and great art scattered across the room. Admittedly, one of the reasons I wanted to check this place out is because local artist Miss Me painted a massive mural at the back of the room and I needed to snap it. It totally rocks - you should check it! We went on a Thursday night so it was a little loud but we had no issue with this. The goods: My fellow Yelper and I both ordered the Mojito del'King and HELLO, we weren't disappointed. It was awesome. The fresh mint was a great touch. On the menu:Guacamole w/home-made tortillas: Very good. The guacamole could have used a bit more seasoning but this probably comes down to personal preference. The tortillas were crispy and light, but not oily.Baja tacos (crispy cod, avocado crema, cabbage slaw): Great! The fish was flaky and perfectly cooked.Ceviche de Camarones (plantain shrimp ceviche, cucumber, red onion, Serrano, oranges, plantain): Delicious! I think this was my favorite dish - it was light and fresh, and bursting with flavor. We also had a beet salad that I don't see on their online menu. It was pretty good. For dessert, we had Churros with Nutella - YUM!Service: Because I procrastinated in writing this review, I forget our waiter's name. All I can say is that he was awesome. Super friendly, knowledgeable and willing to make suggestions. This guy knows what customer service is all about. Price point: With tip, it cost each of us about $44. While this is a tapas place, I found the portions to be pretty generous, and I'd say that if you were solo, you could easily get by on 1-2 tapas. Unless you're like, a Sumo wrestler. Then you might want to order more. All in all, a great spot in the downtown core."

If you're looking for some high-quality Mexican inspired food and good vibes all around, this is the spot. They feature many fun taco flavors and a quesadilla with truffles that is mouthwatering. The smell alone is enough to warrant stars on Yelp. However, the portion sizes are pretty small so if you go really hungry you may be spending a bit of cash. My friend and I ordered two types of tacos (comes with two each) and the quesadilla and we were pretty satisfied with the quantity and ended up paying around $20. I also recommend the churros which melt in your mouth the way a good churro should. I'll definitely be back."

I started with Nacho 2.0 and and corn esquite which were both equally tasty. Highly recommend nacho 2.0 - there are 5 gyoza with cheese inside, topped with a guacamole and a pomegranate pick de Gallo which complemented each other well. The corn esquite is a corn salad with garlic mayo and popcorn. For tacos, I went with two coliflor tacos. After the two appetizers which were spicy the cauliflower tacos felt a bit dry in terms of sauce. I added some Tabasco sauce on top and it was perfect with that addition. The restaurant has great decor with murals of dia de los muertos all over! And I received great service. Will definitely return."

They somehow managed to make the baja fish tacos (which come in 2) light and refreshing despite the fact that they're stuffed with fried fish, and the ceviche was just the perfect blend of flavors and textures.  My friend also enjoyed the Nachos 2.0, but beware that they're actually dumplings, not tortilla chips.We decided to splurge on the pitcher ($45) but it was very strong, so so pretty, and once we muddled up the jalapeños, it had a great kick to it, which complemented our meal really well.The server was quite helpful with suggestions and recommendations about pairing and whatnot when we were conflicted about what to order. And the ambiance! So cool and cozy. Great decorations and perfect lighting. Overall, a 5/5 experience, aside from the pricing."

The ambience is phenomenonal, the painting of the two ladies, the blue skull with flower eyes, the storm trooper & Darth Vader. It was all such a treat to the eyes, I absolutely love how they transformed the space (even the bathroom signs were quirky and fun). I used to be averse the idea of sitting at the bar during a date, but I must admit I had such an amazing time at Escondite. The bar tender was friendly and let us have our space, he also recommended their specials. I must mention, having previously bad Mexican food experiences, it was hard to convince me but this place made me change my opinion altogether. I loved their corn bread (I could have that all day everyday), the quesadilla was the best I have had in the city so far, the fried chicken taco was absolutely amazing. Yes, the food was brilliant and we kept eating and drinking cocktails because we wanted to taste it all and didn't want to wait 2 more weeks for reservations. I can't wait to take all my friends there as an excuse to try out the few dishes I missed. If you go there for the first time, get the 1) tacos, 2) jalepeno corn bread, 3) quesadilla and Miss Paloma cocktail. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Best Mexican I have had so far!"

For our party of 2 we only had to wait for maybe 5 minutes which I felt was rare. Upon being seated, we were greeted almost immediately, even for it being incredibly busy. We took our servers advice at getting 2-3 plates per person & asked for 4 different tacos (they come in 2's), as well as guacamole to start. The guacamole was great, but what really stood out were the chips. Perfectly crisp & thicker than most Mexican places. You could tell they were incredibly fresh. Then came the tacos. We ordered the cauliflower, steak, chicken & pork (there were 2.. I can't remember which we asked for). My favorites were the cauliflower & pork. Though my boyfriends were the steak & chicken. Clearly you can't go wrong on either. The service was very prompt in that every time we had an empty plate, it was taken away. And when our water was low, it was filled right away. I can absolutely appreciate little details like this. I would definitely recommend Escondite if you're in the area looking for a great selection of tacos!"

I'm so sad at how disappointing the experience was. My first attempt to eat here I was turned away because they do not save any tables for walkins! You have to make a reservation or else you will not be seated. The next week once we finally got a reservation we arrived to find that the tacos seemed expensive - 9$ for two tacos (11$ for 2 steak tacos). We were happy to pay if they were good quality. Unfortunately the baja fish taco (fried cod) was super bland and mushy - not crispy as promised. The al pastor tacos were much better but very greasy. Overall, paying 25$ for 4 tacos is extremely steep if they are not amazing. They are also not allergy friendly! Wanted to sub crema for a no -dairy option. Not permitted unless you pay extra. A note about the service, we felt a bit as though the waiter was trying to coerce us into buying little extra sides like salsas. He mentioned it more than once even though we had already declined. We also waited almost half an hour after we had asked to get our bills - while we could see the waiter taking shots with a large party next to us. Kind of weird???The two stars are all for the tasty al pastor tacos - but this place is way too overhyped."

Get reservations cause they are busy everyday. All the drinks are delicious. I got the mojito and a bunch of others they are all potent.They have a $30 sampling menu which is totally worth it.The ribs are some of the best I've every had. The tacos and quesadillas were yummy too. They give you 5 to 6 dishes in the sampling menu which is more than enough for people with a big appetitie. They have a interesting take on nachos. Which are actually dumplings with guac. And Mexican flavors.Keep up the good work guys!

Main issue is price to knock the stars down.Tacos were tasty and we'll priced.Guacamole and chips were nice but the chips needed salt. Quesadilla was really good, but for the portion, over priced.Mojito was not made correctly as it missed crushed ice and sugar crystals. Tasted more like a cocktail. Plus I ordered an extra shot in it, which was 5CAD, while the drink was 8. Weird.Churros were the ultimate winners. I traveled a lot and whenever in Spain or somewhere claiming to have good churros, they all can't live up to these. No grease and an interesting mix of cinnamon with pepper.Nice patio, but lacks music like the cool I side. At least there are no reservations on the patio, so if you were like me, and looked for something last minute in a city that isn't yours, this place satisfies."

The tacos are okay, literally nothing worth mentioning, fish wasn't crispy enough and super bland, beef was not that tender & I believe the tongue was meh) & dessert was meh, even their churros were dry and hard. The bathrooms are super cute and im sure the drinks are good but the food is not a reason why i would waste my night out at Escondite.

I knew I was in for a great meal when I mentioned to local colleagues I was planning to come here and everyone started raving about it. The interior is so cool and funky, with murals and art work and lots of little decorative things everywhere. The servers are super attentive, with very big biceps and/or tattoos. This place was hopping even on a Tuesday night. In fact, it looks like you probably need reservations if you want to eat here at all, if you're not dining by yourself. I was, both times, so I lucked out!I tried a total of 4 types of tacos over two trips:*Baja was delicious - creamy, savoury, crisp, and (relatively) mild. Very fresh ingredients and I love that they use cod instead of basa. Only minus is that the tortilla is cold and kinda doughy. *Lengua - ASTOUNDING. If you love tongue it's a must. If you haven't tried this cut of meat or if you didn't love it before, you will now! The peppery stout sauce it's braised in is just right. The garnishes are absolutely perfect - love the onions and shallots! The tortilla's all crisped up, as well. *Shrimp - very nice. The chorizos are unexpected and delicious, adding a bolder flavour to the sweet shrimp. I expected the shrimps to be mini but to my surprise, they're quite large! Only thing is I'd prefer if they weren't brined with baking soda to make the meat springy. I prefer dense shrimp meat. *El pastor - highly recommended by a colleague and i can see why! Strips of pork belly (right in that sweet spot where it's crispy on the edges and melty/unctuous inside) with grilled pineapple! It's sweet and smoky and savoury - the deliciousness will stay with you. The only downside is it's quite oily - the grease will soak through the crisped-up tortilla and leave a little puddle on the tray. But who cares?This place is definitely going to be one of my regular spots when I'm in town. I can't wait to try their ceviches, churros, and more!"

I opted for a nice cold dos Equis, I may have spelt this wrong, I apologize in advance. We started of with a few guacamole served with there house made chips, the quac was great but the chips lacked a little salt, still pretty awesome. We also tried the cornbread with spicy butter, and my personal favourite , El Chapo, a spicy fusion of mexican/Asian chicken.... this dish was perfect.... the right amount of spice and flavour, incredible.We took a few taco, Pollos Hermanos, yeah named after that breaking bad chicken joint I'm guessing, if your familiar with the show. Fried chicken tacos basically, can't go wrong with that. My meal was enjoyable and the price wasn't too bad either. Would definitely return and try some other tacos, maybe la lengua!"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This was my second time at this restaurant. I came here a few years ago and I remember the food  and drinks being really good. I remember we got to try the bean soup for free and it was delicious.I came her last night with my boyfriend at 6:30pm and it was already packed. We got lucky because we got seated at the bar. The people before us got seated outside and it wasn't very warm out. The bartender was really friendly. She gave us her recommendations and we just ran with it. Everything was delicious!! We first had the nacho 2.0. Don't let the name fool you this was definitely not nachos. It's a gyoza (dumpling) with Monterrey jack cheese inside with jalapeño, queso fresco, pomegranate pico de gallo, guacamole and black pepper créma on top. My boyfriend thought it was nothing special but I really enjoyed this. What's not to like?! Cheese dumplings with guacamole ...yes please!! Then we shared three tacos. The pork one (don puerco) , the steak one (E'steak Koreans and Nopal) and the chicken one (la tinga). All taco dishes come with two tacos so it's perfect to share and try a few. The pork and steak were my fave. The pork one was creamy and flavourful. The sirloin steak had Asian flavours in it. It was a bit spicy because of the pickled jalapeños and it was very tasty. My boyfriend's fave was the steak. The pork and steak tacos were soft shell tacos but the chicken one was hard shell. I was a bit disappointed that the chicken taco wasn't even a shell. It was like a round taco sheet with toppings on top. It was hard to eat and very messy. Luckily I later tried to eat it with a knife and fork and it was perfect because the shell was so hard that it cut nicely and it was easy to gather all the toppings necessary on the fork to get a perfect bite. The chicken almost tasted like pulled pork to me. I didn't really taste the chipotle flavour. Lastly we had the churros. There were three of them. It was crunchy and oh so good with the Nutella. I don't really eat dessert but I actually ate my whole churro and fully enjoyed it. The drinks also were very good. I started with the margarita medianoche (tromba blanca, suze , blood orange tamarind syrup and lime juice). It was a bit bitter and you could really taste the tequila. So if you like strong butter drinks get this one. My boyfriend started with the Kaliman cocktail which tasted like dessert in a glass and looked like a piña colada. It had rum, pineapple juice and cinnamon syrup. If you like sweet drinks get this one! Mojito del king was my favorite. It consisted of dark rum, lime juice, pineapple syrup, soda and mint. My boyfriend and I each got one. It was a bit spicy because of the jalapeño. So good! I like spicy drinks!  Sadly they ran out of the Los arangos reposado tequila which is my fave tequila. So instead we had the serpiente tequila as a shot. It's $2 more the premium one. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back. It's hard to find a good restaurant downtown so I'm glad this restaurant is around and closeby."

Tons of flavor and super fresh. Ayayayaya!Quite a few other Mexican spots have opened up in the city in the past couple years, and generally they are a little bit of a disappointment, but this place is super yummy and really fun.Overall, Escondite is kind of a trendy spot with a downtown crowd which makes it a good place to go out to with a bunch of friends (it is definitely not a quiet family-owned restaurant). Check it out and make sure to try the Mezcal sampler. You won't regret it. Actually, you might the next day, but at least you'll have some good stories to tell."

We went at 5:30 on a Sunday and we sat at the counter because we didn't have a reservation. The server asked if we had any food allergies or restrictions. I'm vegetarian and he listed 5-7 things that I could order off the menu. My Paloma was delicious! I highly recommend the nachos, mango salad, and cauliflower tacos. My husband loved his pork tacos.This meal was the perfect way to start our vacation in Montreal! It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time."

Considering its basically 5$ per taco i would skip this place for Las Capital tacos. Our waiter was extremely rude and pushy last night. He kept asking us repeatedly if we wanted to order drinks despite saying no and rushed us during the entire meal by. Placing our bills on the table before the food had arrived. He even told us that our orders werent ""right"" because we had ordered too little. Like we get it you make money from tips from customers that spend $$ but stop treating us like cash cows. The worst part was that after an hour he told us we had to leave so he could set up the table for the next customers when the resto was practically empty. Extremely poor service with pathetic food portions."

Located on Union avenue in downtown Montreal near Phillips Square and opened since the end of April, I heard a lot about this place all over and finally tried out. I was not dissapointed at all. The place was jam pack, so popular. The waitress was like you have 1h to eat. Ok. A bit rush but it was worth it. Nice vibe, beautiful & authentic mexican decoration into a big industrial loft. Delicious guacamole 6$ for entrees, the ceviche 11$ was good, the ribs 13$ were so delicious, the tacos were ok, my michelada 11$ was refreshing. Service was very fast & pleasant, prices are good. Totally converted, I will need to good back to taste more of the menu + drinks. ¡Buen provecho!5/5 visited in July 2015."

Definitely make a reservation during peak times though or you risk not being seated because the place fills up fast ! We had the guac and chips to start and it was exactly very good -nice crispy house made tortilla and fresh tasty guac. We tried the steak tacos and fried chicken tacos , both were excellent and full of flavour but the standout for me was the steak taco. My coworkers also tried the pork and pineapple taco and fish tacos and they said they loved them both. We also ordered their version of general tao and I definitely recommend giving it a try. Some of my favourite items were the mango salad and the grapefruit salad , fresh and flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The churros were good but were just your regular every day churro , so still yummy but doesn't really standout against other churros I've had. I had a mojito with my meal as well and I have to say that was the one thing I was a bit disappointed with , it had a bitter after taste to it. The prices here are very reasonable and the service was friendly and efficient. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but the decor inside really adds to the experience. There is a fun energy to this place and I would recommend it for an outing with friends or a date."

I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate so many of us but not only that, very swiftly as well.The service was awesome, even as such a large group the waiter was on top of all the orders and consistently checked up on us. Plenty of choices on both the drinks and food menu.    I ordered a mohito, and shared a few tapas among my coworkers. The drinks were alright but to me, the standout of the night was definitely the food choices. The tacos were out of this world. We tried the guacamole, fish tacos, smoked meat tacos, beef tongue tacos, fried chicken tacos and the pork belly tacos. They also have a vegetarian option for all those vegetarians out there.   My favorite was definitely the pork belly taco, which was probably the best taco I've had in montreal. My coworkers also raved around the beef tongue and fried chicken tacos, which at that point I didn't have the room for. Great housemade guacamole as well !     The price point is really reasonable, with the tapas ranging from $6-14 and $7 for 2 decent sized tacos. I'd definitely recommend if you're downtown and looking for a great 5 a 7 place to grab a bite."

Our friendly server immediately got us water and explained the menu and drink specials they had (that weren't on the menu).He immediately sold us on the Mezcal Mules which were phenomenal: multi-dimensional layers of smoke, citrus, spice, and sugar. We were blown away!The small dinner plates are priced around 9$ - 12$ each. Our server recommended 2-3 per person, so we ended up getting the Nachos 2.0 and three taco plates.Right before the nachos came he surprised us with free tequila shots since it was our honeymoon -- they were exceptionally smooth!But nothing on this beautiful green Earth could compare to the nachos, which were loaded with fresh guac, pico de gallo, and authentic Oaxaca cheese. I know what you're thinking: ""That sounds like your typical nacho dish.""Wrong.Each bite carried a combustion of flavors that made you close your eyes and slowly nor your head, ""Yes."" The tacos are made in with ingredients from many different cuisines, like the Korean-inspired taco we got that had bulgogi and jalapeños on it.We finished our experience with homemade churros served with Nutella and a subtle chipotle kick that did not disappoint.Our final bill for the two of us came to $97 after the drinks, 4 dishes, dessert, and a 20% tip. Not cheap but so worth it."

Highly recommend for good ambiance, and mexican food!"
/user_details?userid=-6P3jJwxyzxyYWLUxx4jyQ,Katie S.,"Rochester, NY",5 star rating,"Every single bite we had at Escondite was absolutely phenomenal. It's Mexican with a twist - usually I'm not a fan of twists on classics but in every case, it worked. We started with the Nachos 2.0 - no chips here! Your normal tortilla chip is replaced with the lightest and most delicious cheese and jalapeño goyza, topped with guac, more cheese, and pomegranate salsa. Never thought to pair pomegranate with Mexican but that's all I'll be doing from now on. Now on to tacos. I had the Pollos Hermanos - crispy fried chicken, chipotle crema, every so slightly sweet cornbread croutons and iceberg lettuce. I get it - that combo doesn't SOUND like it would work, but it ABSOLUTELY DOES. The cornbread balances out the chipotle and the iceberg compliments the heavier fried chicken perfectly. Boyfriend had the Don Puercos and he raved as well. And finally, the churros. I've had good churros and I've had horrible excuses for churros, but these were beyond perfect. Crispy on the outside but soft in the middle with a perfectly sugared crust - that's how you do a churro. They come with Nutella to dip which I thought I wouldn't like (there's that twist again) but it TOTALLY works. I honestly wish I lived in Montreal; I'd eat here all the time. Definitely make a reservation - we tried to get in on a Thursday but no dice, so we made a late reservation for Friday. So worth it."

I have never tasted such an amazing combo of steak, sesame, Korean hot sauce in one scrumptious bite. What a flavour sensation. The four stars are due to the beverage.  The margarita was a slight disappointment for it should have been presented without the rocks as a shaken margarita should, the flavour wasn't bad and they did not short you on the tequila for it was present when you took your first sip.

I wish I knew my waiters name but he was beyond great and helped us order all the favorites and we were very pleased.. My boyfriend LOVED the cod tacos and I devoured the steak tacos and the chicken tacos (personally, I was obsessed with the chicken tacos. But make no mistake that the steak was amazing too) we also had the mushroom quesadilla and it too was just too good for words!  We ended with the churros and fought for the last one, they tasted great with the nutella sauce given.

/user_details?userid=613qEpV4V1krUOJePu8B5A,Sergio C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Don't usually write reviews unless the experience is top notch, and that is the case with Escondite. My brother and I decided to try out this authentic Mexican taqueria in downtown Montreal based on other Yelp reviews. We didn't have reservations on a busy Saturday night, but  managed to sweet talk the hostess into letting us squeeze into the bar. A fortuitous move on our part since we ended up sitting next to one of the owners, Moti, who generously treated us to several shots of his best selections of tequila and mezcal as well as getting us on the list at the Fly Gin after dinner was over. After finding out I was from NYC, Moti told us Escondite is fashioned after La Esquina, the famed taco bar in Soho.IMO Escondite's marinated al pastor tacos are second to none. The guac comes out quick and perfectly mashed coupled with homemade tortilla chips. The menu offers several vegetarian options I'll have to try next time I'm in town and I'm showing no hang over effects on a short night's rest :)The ""barrio"" decor's focal point is a large hand painted mural on the back wall, but my favorite detail is the Darth Vader towel rack inside the bathroom with the tag, ""I'm your Papi."" You won't be disappointed if you're into authentic Mexican food in a sexy, yet unassuming local."

And the restaurant was filling up quickly.After a perusal through their menu, we decided on what food we wanted to order...corn bread, baja and pollos hermanos tacos and their version of ""nachos"".We placed our order with one of the bartenders and had to ask for a drink menu.  The wait time for the food was reasonable, however, we still hadn't placed our drink order.  When the waiter served our food, we had to ask him if we could order our drinks.Our food was fresh and delicious.  Small portions.  The complimentary chips and guac dip were nice.  The ""nachos"" were actually dumplings with nacho type filling and toppings.  Delish, but not what we were expecting, especially since there were only 6 dumplings for $12.00!What irked me was that we had finished our food and still hadn't received our drinks! Although we did have water and the refills came often, we were hoping to enjoy our meal with our drinks.  We finally flagged down a waiter/bartender to ask what happened to our drinks and they went to check on it.Drinks were yummy, but strong.  Lots of alcohol (not that I'm complaining), but my friend didn't enjoy hers as much.  Took away from the overall flavour of the drink.Overall,  nice place to meet up with friends and have some drinks and light snacks."

Luckily was able to be seated right away, though I imagine this place has a wait every so often. The decor is a little on the mexploitation tip highlighted by paintings and photos of Mexican lucha libre wrestlers. Our server welcomed us and gave us the newbie rundown, and after examining the menu, we were ready to go. Ordered the Mojito del'King: dark rum, pineapple syrup, jalapeño, pineapple, and mint. Delicious. Not to mention a piece of art. For our food we ordered the corn esquite (just okay) along with three different tacos: the al pastor (amazing, we ordered it twice), the baja (just okay), and the pollos hermanos (can't go wrong with fried chicken). Wasn't too thrilled about paying extra for the sauce (on top of the other expensive things), but we did it anyways. Overall I think this place is perfect for treating yourself and a loved one to a night out."

/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"GOOOOOD TACOS. But 3stars for portion + service + poor spice level. I had Steak Tacos, Mango Salad, Shredded Chicken Tacos. The tacos come in servings of 2 or 3 (extra charge) and also of the same kind. Tacos are extremely small. I had mango salad for appetizer, 2 tacos, was still hungry so had order another round of tacos. I'd recommend the steak tacos, more flavour, sort of sweet. Chicken tacos were all right but nothing special. Mango Salad was pretty fantastic I admit,sweet, sour, spicy. I didn't like the service. Waiter was in a hurry. We were a big group and he seemed overwhelmed by that. They also charged for salsa and the salsa was not even spicy (neither was the tabasco sauce). They didn't offer salsa in the beginning as well and we had to ask for it by the time we were almost done. Portions are not satisfying for the price. Also tried the churros, warm and delicious! Decor has obvious voyeuristic appeal for white crowd (cf: Frida Kahlo, Luchador mask, sugar skull etc)."

But at Escondite, it's definitely taken to the next level as artisanal and craft Mexican food! I would recommend this place for both couples and groups alike.The food is delicious and prepared with fresh ingredients. Their plates are tapas/appetizer-style which means you'll order multiple plates and share (or perhaps keep one to yourself if you fall in love with it).Service was fast and friendly. My only slight complaint is that, for the portion sizes, it is on the pricier side. But the flavors are well worth it."

What sort of restaurant doesn't save room for walk ins on a Wednesday night? If it was the weekend I guess it would be somewhat understandable. Lame...

The dishes are of tapas size and we ordered a lot of food to share. Nice salads, tasty guacomole, and a dish that resembles nachos with cheese the name of which I could not reproduce, but you should order. The tacos are definitely well balanced, the tacos del pastor are not the best I have had yet they were pretty good. The star of the night were the churros with nutella, we couldn't resist, but to order two servings and ate them all, finally feeling happy and inflated. Interesting cocktails, I definitely enjoyed my Mojito del'King and if you are a fan of tequilas or mezcals, you would enjoy sipping some good ones. The bill was split in some weird way between the five of us and I guess we were too full to put some thought in it, so check it well if you are big party.

I liked that their chips weren't standard corn chips but looked fresh fried and had some flavor on them.- Tacos were really delicious - wouldn't change a thing about them. Tortillas tasted homemade (if they aren't, I wanna know what brand they use!)- Drink was good although it could have been sweeter. I liked the little candied pineapple chunks that were in it. - Nice atmosphere. Cons:- Staff could have been more attentive (took awhile to order) but food came out ridiculously quick.

We had 4 different choice of tacos (al pastor, steak, fried chicken) they were all good except the cod which wasn't a big hit. As for dessert we had the key lime pie which was lacking. Whipped cream not firm enough and the lime filling tasted like it was apple sauce based. Very grainy, not limey enough and you could taste the egg yolk. As for drinks, I had the Paloma which was ok.

We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was so fresh, with crisp cucumber, tangy red onion, chilies, and crunchy plantains. Truly memorable.

Food was good, we were six people and that gave us the opportunity to taste all the appetizers, all of which were well done and tasted great. We ordered only two main dishes, smoked meat tacos and fish tacos. The first was delicious adding a Montreal touch to a Mexican favorite, the second was average at best as I could not even taste the fish, the sauce overpowered the ingredients. Some people may prefer the lack of fish taste ... but then what's the point. I would pick another dish next time. The service was odd at best, the wait staff at the table was good, no complaints there whatsoever, however the bartenders left much to be desired. When we entered the restaurant we were about 15 minutes early for our table and all of us wanted to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, we were constantly asked if we could go sit at our table, and only 3 out of 6 of us were actually served at the bar. My friend deduced they wanted us to clear the bar for people that may have come for drinks only. This is the first time this has ever opened to me and was not acceptable. To top it off, after we had been hurried to our table, pre-ordered drinks were not even sent to the table and upon inquiry we were asked politely to order from the drinks menu at the table (the Bourbon based El Chengon (spelling?) was delicious). All I can say is this may have been due to teething pains as it is a new restaurant, customer service was being traded for operational efficiency, hence the 3 stars and not worse, as the mostly great food offset the service issues.   It should be a quick learning experience in a city that has many great choices for restaurants.  We may visit again next year to see if things have changed as this place has good potential"

Still very nice atmosphere, I'll give it that. It's a little drafty inside. They left a jug of water on our table but only cuz we asked them to. And then later took it away. They messed up our reservation and almost seated us at the bar. But somehow found us a table cuz of a cancelled reservation. And they gave us free shots of tequila for the inconvenience. The service is very friendly but slow. They also messed up our food order so gave us some extra tacos on the house. These are my thoughts on the food:The guac is too salty. The nachos and quesadillas are oily. The mango salad is too sweet. The veggie, fish and chicken tacos are all Very fried and oily. The chicken ones taste like KFC in a taco. Wasn't a fan of the smoked meat tacos.  There is only 1 choice of red wine and 1 choice of white wine. No offense but I won't come back. Montreal has much better Mexican restos."

The place is nice though, a bit hard to get in without a reservation. Try the dumplings and the fish tacos! Oh and the cornbread is amazing!!! Just needs more of that little spiced butter on the side."

The outside looks awful, but the inside is beautiful and fun. And the food--oh my heavens, great! Take their advice on several things, but definitely get the ribs and the nachos.  We also loved the cauliflower tacos and guac. We did not love the margarita unfortunately but the jalapeño mojito was fab. We want to go here every day now."
/user_details?userid=RRht2LKVtV68PRDZry4wtw,Chloe A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was honestly very disappointed with my meal. It started off great, we started with guacamole to share and it was delicious. However the tacos we ordered to share were a let down. I ordered the Baja (fish) tacos and the pollos hermanos (fried chicken) tacos. The fish tacos were so fried that they were overwhelming, they didn't taste like tacos at all just like fried batter. The chicken in the chicken tacos was very grey, fatty meat, not good quality by any means and not the quality I would have expected from such an upscale place. My boyfriend ordered the smoke meat tacos, which he liked but didn't think they were anything to rave about, and the Don Puerco (pork) tacos which were pretty bland. We're both students and were looking to treat ourselves to a nice meal and we left feeling pretty dissatisfied. However I do have to say that their service is great, very attentive servers, too bad the meal left something to be desired."

I had been there many time so I was happy to recommend it for my friend's b-day. I must admit the food was very good. But that night,  Worst service I have ever had. We were 7 people and somehow they forgot to put in our order for 1h30, We didn't manage to even get guacamole and tortillas on the table until 10pm (we arrived at 8h30pm) and that was after inquiring about our order 4 times to different bus boys and waiters. We had to constantly request more than twice everything, be it a drink, water or additional tortillas or until I finally got up to get it myself. It was aggravating. The only comp we got was shots that we didn't order... and I mean shots on an empty stomach is not really smart. I like this place, but i wouldn't recommend going as a group. I don't think they can handle it."
/user_details?userid=kqugAIe1ff5Yu0-OrgtQbg,Kat A.,"Birmingham, AL",5 star rating,"I am giving this place a 5 star because the food and service was phenomenal. It is a Mexican restaurant and not a fancy or upscale place as I usually expect 5 stars to be but the food was amazing and the staff fantastic. The nachos were very unique, like dumplings with nacho topping and I could have eaten nothing but those. I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had beef and they were fantastic too which is why I am giving 5 stars, when it comes to this type food and place I could not imagine anything better."

We had (they had other styles of tacos) the fish tacos 2 very tasty portions that had a perfect piece of crunchy cod in them. The  mojito with jalapeño peppers was very good and the best were Escodite's chiros mmmmmm good.

Great ambiance and kind staff.  Everything was delicious.  My least favorite was the churros.  Mango salad is a must try.  The fish tacos were AMAZING! Portions are small, but they are great for sharing! I already know what I will have when I go back!!!  It is a must try and probably best to reserve.  It was packed."
/user_details?userid=YyfExLm6obCwmFQVsEVIYw,Debbie S.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",2 star rating,"Very mediocre food. Guacamole lacks pop. And is very one dimensional. Tortilla chips are much too oily and chewy. The pork ribs were pretty good mostly but some pieces were dry. The beet ceviche was extremely unimpressive. The chicken and fish tacos were too oily, lacked pop and very much meh. I will not be returning and would not recommend this restaurant although the service was good and the decor interesting. Quite loud as well."
