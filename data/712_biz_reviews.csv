/user_details?userid=Lnp-AXObo_hvrl8YGCo7Cg,Jiho H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Honestly, if this was in Korea I would give it 2 stars. But this place is the most authentic Korean barbecue place you can find in downtown montreal: especially compared to that fake 'seoul' 'charcoal' place it is multiple times better. I give it 4 stars for a balance."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First time here, weekday dinner. We arrived at 5:30, no need to wait. We received warm welcome. Overall the service was good. We only got one wrong order and we took it in. The food was good.  I like the two kinds of beef the best. I also had other Korean dishes as potato noodle, spicy soup, sushi  and other side dishes.  They are average but for all you can eat restaurant , I lower my expectations so I enjoyed them. For sure they can't be as good as the dishes from authentic menu a la carte Korean restaurant. I really like the lattice wrapping the meat. I will order tons of lattice next time."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ideally, I'd give this place a 3.5. Do not go here for the bingsu. It is literally shaved ice (not shaved cream, which is what bingsu should be), mixed with condensed milk and chocolate/strawberry sauce. You end up with a soupy mess. Do not go here for the cheese corn. It is more mayo than cheese. Unless if you like spoonfuls of mayo. However, the fried chicken we had was very good. The bbq meats were also yummy. The shrimp came slightly cut open already so it's easier to get the shell off after BBQ-ing. And the pork bone broth was very good as well. Loved the deep fried buns! It's just that a lot of the foods are super starchy and filling so it's hard to try more of the menu. The service was also great. They were speedy since you had a button to notify the severs when you needed attention. We did go on a Wednesday though, and around 6pm. Not quite sure how overwhelming things might get for the staff when it's more prime time!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just like the one on Somerled, this is an all you can eat korean BBQ. The menu varies from meats, seafood, veggies, soups, etc. The food were fresh and delicious. You definitely don't leave this place on an empty stomach. For a saturday evening, we paid 28$ before tax and tips which is a similar price to other all you can eat places. The service is quick and the staff are nice. They seem to have a lineup but we were lucky to get a table right away. The place is clean and nicely decorated. They have a second floor. We had a nice experience, but it was  just so hot on the second floor that it became almost unbearable. The staff confirmed that they are trying to fix the issue. Would definitely come back again. Be weary of the smell on your hair and clothes after you leave."

I was truly deceived by how bad it escalated and how they kicked us out without warning. I do hope they reflect on how they treat their costumers. Along side, they kept giving us wrong orders, and even then we ate the food because they couldn't take it back.Truly a terrible experience."
/user_details?userid=h3vabCx8hY5SeYXz-D-GJQ,Yijia H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Just be aware that they are no longer doing ayce anymore. I don't know if it's just temporary or not.
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to other Mon Ami restaurants and they've all been average. So when I came here for AYCE, I didn't have high expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how I really enjoyed my experience! We came on a Monday night at around 6:30 pm, so it wasn't busy. Many reviews complain about the service, but I thought they were pretty fast with our orders. What I really like is that you can eat traditional Korean food at an all you can eat BBQ. Being able to order small portions of fried chicken (what Mon Ami is known for), bibimbap, black bean noodles, japchae, kimchi fried rice, tteokbokki (rice cake), tteok kkochi (rice cake skewers), ramen, pajeon (green onion pancake), jjigae is amazing! There's also the typical food items like kimbap, dumplings, kimchi, fries which are classics. The meats, seafoods and vegetables are pretty ordinary, although I did like that you could order lettuce to wrap them. Drinks are also unlimited which is an added bonus. I do agree that they missed some of our orders but it's pretty common at restaurants like these, so it didn't both me too much. The desserts were pretty disappointing, but I did like that they offered bingsu (although it's not the best). Prices are also pretty affordable, event for supper (less than $30 on a weeknight). I'd rate this place 4 stars because it's not the best Korean food, but for an AYCE restaurant, I really like it."
/user_details?userid=Xr34XxMXBXwknSiGrUpxlg,Kueng Y.,"Fullerton, CA",1 star rating,I hope this franchise won't stand for Mon Ami franchise and even Korean BBQ place. Me and my friend went here on weekday night because the waiting line of Gyu-Kaku was too long. I had to admit this is worst decision. I have lived in Korea for so many year. And I went to KBBQ at least once a month. We both agreed that this is the most terrible KBBQ even in our life. Foods: meat quality is okay Service: servers are completely not attentive and they always mess up your order. We have waited for our order for over 20 minutes . So we talked to a server and he said that our order is almost ready. 10 minutes later and still nothing. I complained about it and we gonna reorder it. Here the worse service happen: the staff are so mad and keep sending out foods to us. Even we did not order those food and still send to us. They did that because they were mad about we reorder the foods. Worse service ever

/user_details?userid=MgzevIKSWnLVxrcu-qCbhw,Katrina Tracy M.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I am a big fan of Korean foods.I have been craving for this the whole week.I must say I was a little bit disappointed with the food because I have been to more authentic Korean restaurants.The place was nice though.Staff were friendly so that's a plus for them.
/user_details?userid=DMAi7qtXCRpTCdkoG6_mmg,Kelsey ..,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place hires the rudest people to deal with their customers. They never delivered parts of our orders, gave us more than what we had actually ordered and kicked us out without warning after having taken another one of our orders. They only informed us we had to leave after we reached out to staff for something. We never got that last order by the way. They straight up told us to leave which is fine because it is a busy restaurant and we can understand. But, the way the servers talk down to you is ridiculous."
