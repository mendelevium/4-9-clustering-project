It's kind of similar to Sushi Momo, yet different (but both are very good). I had the Kamikaze Tunato, Queen, and avocado hosomaki as part of the one-person combo, which also comes with miso soup and 3 gyoza. Highly recommend."

And in the end it was quite good, and the room was beautiful and the service was wonderful and the wine and presentation were great and... perhaps we just ordered a bit off. We got the chefs choice sharing plate and I found that there was just too much going on flavourwise. The tastes were very much like those at Sushi Momo, which is to be expected, and I guess I was hoping for a little more subtlety, perhaps more focus on special heirloom vegetables and their beautiful flavours rather than on sauces and spice combinations and dips. As I said, all of this may be present at Bloom and we simple missed it. Will have to give it another try, but perhaps not right away."

Most of us from our group of 8 went with the sharing menu where for 36$ we shared enough food to fit an army including a delicious miso soup, the veggie gyoza, sushi platter with over 10 different sushi, and finally match ice cream for desert. We absolutely loved the food! The sushi was especially delicious and creative; great flavour combinations and in some cases, like the Bollywood, wildly unexpected! We had also ordered a few cocktails and although the flavour was there the alcohol was lacking. Opt for a table rather than banquets as they seemed to be uncomfortable to rest your back on! Service was good although I would have preferred taht someone ask me if I wanted an extra cocktail; I wouldn't have said no ;)"

The concept is similar to Sushi Momo but a touch more elegance which comes from the side of LOV. They make a tomato tuna called ""tunato"", try it. I love that they use lots of traditional vegan Japanese ingredients such as shiso, yuzu, yuba etcNeed to come back very hungry and try the sushi boats!"

LOV+MOMO=BLOOM  it was as expected and did not disappoint. From the decor to the menu and service, all was amazing... the only thing i would change is to add Gluten free options so i could return more often without getting bored of the current selection. Very happy to have discovered yet another plant based gem..."

Every dish is hearty and flavorful; you won't miss having sashimi or nigiri at a place like this. SOBA & MANGO SALAD: piled high on top of a bed of greens with candied pecans and watermelon radish sprinkled throughout, this is a refreshing starter - CAD$12MR. MIYAGI - freshly battered & fried shiso leaf supporting a tiny mountain of avocado, mango, bell peppers, and light sesame dressing. Texture and flavors play well together, would order again. KUMO ROLL- shimeji mushroom, inari sweet tofu skin, avocado, pickled cuke, tororo kombu (kelp), sesame sauce, imitation bonito flakes - CAD$10MR. CRUNCH ROLL - medley of shiitake, shimeji, enoki, oyster mushrooms + avocado, bubu arare (puffed rice), truffle sauce - CAD$14 - total umami bomb, the crunchy rice is a good contrast to the creamy mushrooms and avocadoBOLLYWOOD ROLL - vegan shrimp, avocado, sweet potato, green onion, shiba zuke (pickled cuke), Japanese curry aioli - CAD$10 - my favorite! I wanna put this curry aioli on EVERYTHING. vegan shrimp is perfection--good amount of bite and flavor"

I will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=S5ctdm7RTh2boNvlkZY4wg,Ssu Ying C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Not a vegan or vegetarian myself, was worry whether we would have not enough food because it's all veggie, turns out we all got full and satisfied. Every dish is creative and contains various flavour. Even drinks manu has it's own specialty. We total six people, and we had tasting manu ($36 /person), total 71~75 pieces of sushi, including soup and appetizers, the amount of food is just perfect portion for each one of us.Atmosphere in the restaurant is also romantic, perfect for dating or just friends gathering. Strongly recommend."

Being a fan of Momo (which is amazing), I was super excited to try their sister restaurant. While the presentation was gorgeous, it just really wasn't tasty. All the rolls tasted the same and we tried many of them. Even the dumplings and soup were completely tasteless. I am not sure if maybe we caught them on an off night, but I won't be trying again."

I was blown away, honestly this was the best sushi I've had, even better than Sushi Park on Sunset, LA.The food was amazing, absolutely delicious:) It's a new contemporary style resto in the Old Port with a huge potential! I highly recommend!"

B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The deliciously appointed perfumed smells of human benevolence and compassion for all living beings is so sweet here; as Spring is, indeed, in full bloom at this excellent vegan sushi resto. My partner, Rebecca, and I went here once upon a wintery Montréal night (tonight) but as we crossed the threshold we found ourselves hot on the heels of the hanami or annual flower viewing in Japan. The denizens of Nihon-koku (Japan) follow the sakura (cherry blossoms) and as the blossoming begins we chased the sweet scent of the bloom northwards from Okinawa to Kyoto and onwards to Tokyo, then we ascended into areas at higher altitudes and finally arriving in Hokkaido several delicious courses later. Yes, we are our way to sushi Nirvana. The Buddha might've cultivated loving-kindness and compassion by meditating for years on end but who has time for that in this fast paced neoliberal death and fascist toil economy (seriously though we must break the neoliberal/neocolonial patriarchal chains that bind us and also meditation does make such a difference but I digress) I decided I could bypass the middle man (my mind) and get straight to the bliss in my belly. Come here all ye faithful and rejoice in the delicious food. Indeed no animals were harmed in the production of this deliciousness in my tummy. Oh and it's 4/5 stars because the tempura dipping sauce was way too salty, same for the sauce for the agedashi tofu sauce. Other than that amazing, rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub."
