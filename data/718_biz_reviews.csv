/user_details?userid=WsXo92PWKfur8wwugbUIsA,Dimitri F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Always order it on Ubereats. It's one of the best burgers in Montreal and the shakes are very good. I just wish their uber delivery would show up on the app since they make the deliveries themselves.
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My go-to late night food delivery for the past 8 years. If you're looking for gourmet or healthy options, this is NOT it. But if you're lazy to cook or it's its 3am and you just got home from a night out... THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED. all time favourites - chicken fettuccini (so tasty and creamy),  chicken tenders with fries (juicy, crunchy and lightly spiced! ), burgers great too. Delivery is fast and efficient. Overall comes out to similar price as Uber eats. Portions are big, you'll likely have leftovers."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Through DoorDash, I ordered from Chef on Call. I heard many many positive comments about this place. My sister is obsessed with their milkshakes. I wish I could get milkshakes, but my stomach doesn't agree with milk unless it's lactose free. Sadly, the option wasn't available. I opted for a vegetarian burger with curly fries and side garlic mayo sauce. The burger itself was well done and greatly dressed. It was delicious. The curly fries were absolutely succulent, and garlic mayo sauce made the whole dish special. Definitely to retry this place again and again."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Chef On Call is my late night booty call. Some days it's good and some days it's ordinary. Yet it's still my go-to for cravings in the middle of the night! My favourites from Chef on Call are the milkshakes (Orea with extra Nutella), hot dog, Popcorn Chicken, poutine and curly fries!! The burgers are average, the wraps are below average. This place is definitely a hit or miss though. I order often from here, and most days it's the same order. Some days the quality, flavour and quantity is a 10 and other days its a 4. Would be great if they would take feedback seriously and make these changes!!! Regardless I would recommend Chef On Call for those late night bingeing PMS sessions!!"
/user_details?userid=DfHYd_XUqnI1-IUNtgzlOQ,Abigail P.,"Kanata, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is great for late night comfort food especially since its open until 4am. You can't go wrong with their burgers, milk shakes, poutine, or chicken strips. This place is much better quality than fast food, hence the higher prices. Highly recommend if you're looking for some good late night food and want something better than fast food."
/user_details?userid=P7YuMh74-I2cDq7oU8frww,Shannon C.,"York Regional Municipality, Canada",4 star rating,"Super great burger and amazing milkshake! This place was near my Airbnb and it was very clean inside. We saw the owner walk around cleaning, offering customers water while waiting for their orders, and making sure his employees cleaned up the tables well.Originally we were going to order online but ended up being close by and ordered take out instead. It was like a dollar something cheaper in store than when we totaled online so that was a weird surprise. Ordered their mushroom burger and it's huge!! All the flavours were great and it was all I could ask for in a great burger. We ordered an Oreo milkshake and it was surprisingly super good, not overly sweet or thick, I couldn't stop drinking it.I'd give a 4.5 ONLY because when we ordered extra sauce, we were missing one container. It really is the little stuff that counts. But would definitely come back to try another burger and shake. Judging from other reviews, delivery seems to be iffy and anything other than burgers and shakes are disappointing?"
/user_details?userid=tejGH-sqC2iRz2ZQTZgsqw,Ed A.,"Weehawken, NJ",3 star rating,"It was my first trip to Montreal, and I knew my first dish needed to be poutine. As it happens, this place was around the corner from my hotel, so I hurried over there and ordered a ""small"" poutine (as it was late afternoon and I didn't want to over-eat before dinner). Not sure if it got lost in translation or if the ""small"" in Montreal is actually a medium, but I got a fairly large order of fries/curds/ gravy on the side. I originally intended to eat half and save the rest for the next day (my hotel had both a fridge and microwave). However, the food itself was tasty enough that I wound up eating the whole thing.  They had a variety of other fast foods (burgers/sandwiches). Also, given their proximity to McGill, they can attract quite a large number of college students.  I'd imagine this place gets mobbed late at night after the bars close, so plan accordingly (I think they close at 4am)."
/user_details?userid=AQ2NQCAQFBukeFcrVcuBqw,David S.,"Worcester, MA",5 star rating,"This is the best super late night joint I've ever been to. Open till 4am! Gnarly! And this place was literally a 1 minute walk from my flat. And you guessed it, veg-friendly. Mind blown. I went here two nights in a row, around closing time, and ordered the veggie burger and vegan poutine both times. Dude. Best poutine I had during my stay. And the veggie burger was almost too good I made the cashier double check it was def vegan the second night.Their curly fries were unreal too. The serving sizes for one entree were fit for two people and the price was quite reasonable. This is the epitome of a late night veg-friendly drunken guilty pleasure. Come to America please! Cheers."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We hired Chef on Call to cater for our yearly Research Day conference. We had always delt with building services for catering before, so we were a bit stressed about how ordering from outside would go. We contacted them well ahead of time (this summer) to get an idea of the menu and pricing, and one of our coordinators went to sample the food. She returned more than satisfied and full! After comparing prices with two other catering services, we decided to go for Chef.On the day of the conference, Chef on Call arrived ahead of time and discretly set up the tables and plated the food. When the morning conference presentations ended, we all headed over to the lunch area - which was a sight to behold!! The tables had been covered with tablecloths and large platters of wraps, sandwiches, veggies, fruits, treats, bakeries and more. There was also plenty of ustensils, plates and napkins. According to our post-conference surveys, the lunch was actually a highlight of the day for most people!I think there was more than enough food for everybody, but even then, our guests finished all sandwiches. Fruits also flew away from the plates. There was quite a bit of veggies and salads  leftover, much to the delight of our money- and vitamin-deprived graduate students (they brought them home after the event).We were very happy!"
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've had Chef On Call a few times already, always at night for a late night bite. I've tried the poutines - the Almighty and the Buffalo Chicken. I prefer the Almighty just because I like the original gravy flavour more than the sauce that comes with the buffalo chicken. Their large size is a very good portion considering I finished it in 3 different times. Their burger - spicy crispy crunch was your standard chicken burger but really tasty nonetheless. I like to substitute fries for onion rings - and I enjoy the sauce that comes with the side which I believe is spicy mayo. I like Chef On Call, because there's no delivery fee and it's open until late! Will probably continue ordering from here."
/user_details?userid=lCzPI8UJijp1kpLMUIAOKA,Nessa N.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,Very kind and understanding. Food was fantastic. Can't wait to come back to Montreal and go there again. Thank God it stays open later than midnight. Everything here closes early.
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I haven't gotten delivery from this place yet, but dining in was a very fun experience.I like the layout of the store, I think the staff was really nice. They also have this base walk-in menu where everything is 10$! and it comes with a drink. That's pretty great in my opinion. I ordered the poutine with bacon and an oreo milkshake. The poutine was good, I've had better, but it was well made. The milkshake is the definite winner. It was so good, it's nothing like those places that say it's a milkshake but really it's just ice cream in a cup with a straw. The oreo milkshake was so smooth and pleasant and refreshing. It even had little bits of oreo to add some crunch."
/user_details?userid=KUzSS0uiCIlQIcJT63pjGw,Carlito B.,"La Salle, Canada",2 star rating,"I like this place a lot. They are great at catering. The restaurant is open late. They have the best chicken tenders but for the last few time the tenders were just a huge breast of chicken. Way too thick. Wasn't always like that. Felt like the chefs were lazy. So on my next visit I ordered the popcorn chicken thinking it will be bite sized chicken pieces but unfortunately not. Again! The chef got lazy and provided with huge pieces of chicken. Just cut the damn chicken, butterfly filet the bitch. It's too bad but I will settle with just milkshakes and poutines from this place from now on."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ordered the buffalo chicken poutine from here. By far, it's the worst poutine I have ever had. The chicken tasted stale and over cooked. The gravy was quite bad too. Never ordering poutine from was quite bad too. Their burgers are all right."
/user_details?userid=rMTvmF9-veDdTCXJZ6Ep5Q,Stephanie K.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,"Boyfriend insisted to order from this place as he said it was good from 4 years back when he first tried. Giving them 1 star so it can grab some attention. As you can see from the picture, we ordered 6 chicken wings and they gave us 5 drumsticks. Might as well call it ""chicken drums stick"" and cross out ""wings"" from the menu. We called them, and all they said was it was all random selection and they claimed that chicken is on shortage (lol), there are less wings than drums. We're definitely speechless, and disappointed. They definitely ordered massive drums just because it is cheaper. It is common sense that when we order chicken wings, you expect to get half wings/drums. If it was even 2 or 3 it would've been fine. Server handled the situation badly through the phone when we call back. The other foods tasted great, just so if you want some wings, make sure you seek elsewhere."

/user_details?userid=T_87e4w0qxlR2NGCMIOSxQ,Rachel K.,"Austin, TX",2 star rating,This was suggested by our hotel's concierge and we were very disappointed. The prices were very high and the food was mediocre at best. Our BLT sandwich had one slice of bacon on it and had no flavor. Would not recommend.
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Reliably great burgers, chicken tenders and milkshakes. This is all one needs to know on a Friday night at 3am. Yes, some of their dishes fall flat, but I don't understand who orders an Alfredo from these sorts of places anyway. The veggie burger is embarrassing and sort of falls apart. The wraps never come or look as advertised. Sorry vegetarians... What they do very well are late night comfort staples: burgers, chicken, poutine and a really damn good Oreo milkshake, and they provide this fare enthusiastically and with good service. The burgers hold up well for delivery. The food is fresh, even the salads seem 'real' and not an afterthought. I'm a fan for several years, and will continue to be."

There is a sandwich called Donator, that changes from time to time and part of the money on the purchase is for charity. Despite the great menu and the tasty food, the team is great!

/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,Just opened on Park and it's definitely an upgrade from their old spot on Sherbrooke! Their veggie burger hits the spot when you're crazing one and their fries are perfection fresh and hot out of the flyer. Love the new interior and am always glad for delivery when it's too cold outside. Their online delivery page is wonderful. Try their Oreo Milkshake if you really want to treat yourself!
/user_details?userid=GvyUYAKlDooiddSpiq3yZw,Kari K.,"Mississauga, Canada",1 star rating,"Their delivery service disappointed.  They boast ""gourmet"" food late at night but couldn't even fulfill my order or offer me a proper refund.  I ordered a drink only to fulfill the minimum delivery amount and didn't receive it, which made me pretty upset but I had already done the transaction and tipped the guy when he told me he forgot it.  Only offered me credit for a pop next time but I definitely won't be pouring my money into them again.  Bottom line, definitely not gourmet"
/user_details?userid=wkXm63MheXiLAD-W3bSRdg,Bibi G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've been ordering from Chef On Call for a while, probably ordered around 15-20 times in the past 3 months... But everytime the delivery guy is at the door, he ""has no change"" and I'm forced leaving him with an extra tons of money because I have no smaller bills or change... I mean, in a restaurant if a customer would come and ask for change and I'd tell him ""Sorry, i don't have any"" how unprofessional would that be? I just ordered and I was forced to leave a 20$ bill on a 15$ order. My boyfriend was once forced to leave 9$ behind because of that. They ask for our payment method when checking out why not be ready for that?It's not even about how much we leave behind, but that makes me wanna give 0 tips anymore. Really unprofessional."

/user_details?userid=RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,Madhu K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have known this place since they used to be on Sherbrooke. And they have got even better since they moved on du Parc street. They not only provide totally tasty burgers, sandwiches amd salads to hungry late night birds in the McGill ghetto but also their food is tasty, fresh and the service is quick. Although known for their food delivery service, they also have walk in specials for 10$ if you live nearby and these meals are a super deal for students or people on budget.I also like the ambience of their place now - modern, simple and depicting Montreal's streets on its roof!! I usually end up eating my meal there if I walk in."
/user_details?userid=BsKDq9Vf0DLyGQ_KxFC-WQ,Steve G.,"Newark, DE",1 star rating,I gave this 1 star only because I couldn't do Zero stars. It is a delivery service made for 2AM munchies. The fries will be soggy and cold. The sand which dry and cold (see the pattern) and do not order the Poutine. You will not want to poutine that in your mouth (cold and flavorless).

My friends and I ordered: a hot dog, Mac & cheese bites, and two chef on call sauces. They told us 25 minutes for delivery. After over an hour and two phone calls... no food. I live only 10 minutes away by car. We called to complain and asked to speak to the manager, we were told they couldn't help us. He didn't seem to care that we were waiting for our food, he was incredibly rude. In the end, we refused the cold food.

/user_details?userid=aVxpgZk6ZwUBKzvCs2Ae4w,Jacqueline N.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"After walking past it everyday for months, I decided it was finally time to give the place that McGill students rave about a try. The location is very ideal, just off of Sherbrooke on Parc. The building is quite new with a very sleek modern wood look! They have big tvs and lots of communal seating. I went in the afternoon and it was nearly empty which was surprising considering how much talk it gets. Maybe most people do take out/delivery? I got the Vegetarian Cubano sandwich and sweet potato fries. The portions were very generous! It was pretty much the ultimate comfort food! The sweet potato fries were amazing! Perfect crispiness and flavor! Some of the best I've had and that's saying something. But what is really fantastic about this place are the sauces. Basically just variations on a theme of mayonnaise but delicious nonetheless. The chef on call sauce was a great dipping sauce for the fries and sandwich! Mmm! Needless to say, I ordered delivery a few days later because it was that good."
/user_details?userid=nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,Henry L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The service, quality, and price of this student favorite make it worth the four stars. I've been to Chef on Call multiple times and have never left disappointed. Their Penne Arrabbiata is amazing and only $10 (plus tax) with the walk in special which includes a canned drink. To be fair, it isn't culinarily exotic or the most flavorful food in the world, but the consistency of great service, good food, and price make it worth a visit. If you're in Montreal as a tourist I recommend going elsewhere but for students, and residents this is a terrific place for a quick and quality meal. Note, they offer free, and in my experience rapid delivery within the downtown area."

It was also great that they were able to help me out in english, because I tried to order from so many other places that just did not work out because I could not speak french. From my understanding this is ran by a bunch of college students, which made me more inclined to tip even better.If you're in Montreal on a trip like I was and just want to sit, relax, and order in after a long day- I would definitely recommend ordering from here! don't forget the deep fried mars bars."

WTF? Fortunately I called because I had waited forever for my food!...and sorry guys but we're in Montréal here so you should have bilingual employees. Even if I'm French-Canadian I wrote this review in English! Nobody's speak my mother tongue there.

I've never physically eaten at Chef on Call, but I definitely call on them when I'm too lazy to cook for myself and want to indulge. They're friendly, convenient, and have plenty to offer! I've tried nearly everything on the menu and usually alternate between these.My personal recommendations - Chic salad.Burgers: Spicy Big Crunch, Oh So Crispy, and The Gourmet.Chicken tenders.Milkshakes: Oreo, Chocolate, Vanilla.Wraps: Chicken Caesar, Buffalo, Chicago Club, California.Enjoy, friends!!"
/user_details?userid=WCHArapR0ZhduJElR9axjA,Farin I.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Okay so its 3 am, freezing cold out and you want some gourmet food but too lazy to cook on your own. Who do you Call? ""Chef-On-Call"" This place has sweet potato fries and a garlic sauce that is from out of this world! Its kinda in a pretty shady location, and do not have much big of a room for eat-in service. There's only 2 seating tables that can hold probably 4-5 people per time, max. Whatever though, this place is great for take-out and especially the nifty delivery service."

Tonight they have outdone themselves by not delivering the order PERIOD and not answering the phone when trying to inquire about the order or cancel it!!! Waited on hold for 10 minutes, no answer still and 1:30 hr later, the store being literally 3 blocks away from my apartment having not answered or arrived; I safely assumed they just brushed me and my order off completely or failed to note it somehow! Never again!!!!"
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"we were walking around the neighborhood,and found this place, it's a bit hard to find since it's in the basement so you have to walk down the stairs and the entrance is a bit concealed...It's a small cozy place, nothing fancy, but the menu is quite extensive and they open late. They close at 3 or 4 am or something like that.The staff in young and friendly, very homey service. They have these old joke plaques on the wall it's kitschy and cute.we ordered pasta and a wrap. The portions are fine, however it is a bit pricey for regular take-out food. They wings and pasta, wraps and burgers, poutine, the list goes on... they have a lot of things you would want at 2 am that give comfort in the winter. The place seems geared toward college students since it's so close to McGill ghetto.For dessert I had pot de creme, it was very nice :)definitely on my list for lazy food comfort"

After waiting an hour and a half the Delivery guy showed up with half our order and ""wups"" was all the compensation we got. Terrible experience. #stillwaiting #chefoncall #mcgill #concordia.

/user_details?userid=st305yA2flJtOPCqUVzmvg,Sarah G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Chef on Call is the best delivery food in Montreal hands down. They deliver until 4am on weekends, their staff is really friendly, and the food always tastes fresh and of quality.The sweet potato fries are amazing, and all of the dipping sauces are so good. Try the chicken tenders, any of the wraps, or even the light dishes like the Chic salad are a good choice. If you don't want pizza, Chef on call is the best option!"
/user_details?userid=-G-KDAageCzbqgZXuy8C1A,Therese K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Terrible experience ordering from here. I placed the order on their website, waited for an hour before calling to see what the situation was, and was told that the food was on its way. An hour later, the food still hadn't arrived, so I called again and they told me that the order hadn't processed because of a mistake on their end. Even worse, the best they could offer us after being 2 hours late was a 25% discount and the food arriving in an hour! Terrible first experience here, and I will never be ordering again."

/user_details?userid=xwuHfnyq883swNk3fBRK-A,V G.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,"The concierge at the Holiday Inn down the street pointed us to this place, which was perfect for two tired and hungry travelers looking for a quick bite to eat. We split the sweet potato poutine and each got a wrap. So delicious! If I lived in Montreal, I would eat here ALL the time. Speedy service and reasonably priced."
