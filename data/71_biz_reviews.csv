/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Came by here on my trip to Montreal and saw that they had highly rated dumplings. It was a busy day with a fairly busy restaurant so you could tell they were definitely popular. We were seated after a short wait and given our menus. They had a lot of options but my friend and I decided to try out their boiled pork and chinese cabbage dumplings and the pan fried beef and onion curry. Our food came out after a bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it. It wasnt anything astounding but definitely very well made dumplings with plenty of flavor and care. Id definitely swing by here if you get a chance, especially if you enjoy dumplings! :)"

Order more!!I do however, prefer the steamed dumplings over the fried.Each meal comes with hot tea, just perfect during cold weather."
/user_details?userid=X0NJT_YrZg6-U9oRGJcYKQ,Eric B.,"Lewisville, TX",3 star rating,"Ok Nothing really to get excited about to me . If I had a choice between these and the frozen ones served at the fast food restaurants I would say you choose.My wife really likes these dumpling things and turned me onto them years ago . She prefers the steamed and I the fried (go figure).Anyway when we go traveling I always try and search out a few dumpling spots on yelp and that is how we ended up here.After seeing the pictures of the art on the walls I thought this place would really knock our socks of but it was just ok. The amount of filling in the dumplings was small to me .Dont get me wrong I am not putting the place down it was just ok to me.The place was clean the service was nice and the prices were good, and if I was in the neighborhood again I would give it another try, but I would never stand in line for this."
/user_details?userid=9a4vZIcQ_Qj7cWJaf1w1OA,Mark Y.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"We were itching for some good dumplings and saw the good reviews on Yelp so we gave this spot a try. We ordered beef and leek dumplings (fried), pork and shrimp dumplings in soup, pork and leek dumplings (fried) and the jelly fish/cucumber appetizer.Dumplings were decent, but if you've had some of the better dumpling shops in Vancouver or Toronto, then you would probably be disappointed here.  Don't get me wrong...definitely solid dumplings, but we were expecting a little more. The wrapping is nice and thin, but taste was lacking in the filling.  Also, small complaint, but the soy sauce and vinegar tasted like they were watered down.Service is about what you'd expect and the restaurant itself is clean and bright.Tip: this place is cash only, so come prepared. They have an ATM in the foyer but you're going to pay a hefty service charge."
/user_details?userid=nyl_1VcRIAyI55bb_scpdw,Mary T.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"I love dumplings. Without dumplings, my life would be incredibly empty and incomplete. I go through physical withdrawal symptoms if I don't have them for more than a week!I had checked in to my hotel and needed to grab some dinner. I realized that Chinatown was a mere six minutes away by foot. I decided to do takeout by ordering online on Skip the Dishes and picking it up at the restaurant. I chose Mai Xiang.I got pan-fried pork and mushroom dumplings. I also got steamed shrimp, chive, and egg dumplings. They both came with soy and spicy dipping sauces. The staff at this restaurant were nice when I went in and picked my order. I thanked the woman and walked back to my hotel room to chow down.The pan-fried pork and mushroom dumplings were pan-fried and stuck together. Yep, they are called potstickers for a reason! I absolutely loved the filling and the flavour. They were tasty and were my favourite out of the two flavours.The steamed shrimp, chive, and egg dumplings were good. I think that they may taste better pan-fried. The filling needed more flavour. Dipping them in the soy and spicy sauces helped me eat everything up.It's a solid place to get authentic dumplings. I'd go back and try more items, and get the pork and mushroom dumplings again.(310)"
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When you need that dumpling hit, this is it. We ordered the fungus salad (yeah...literally another word for mushroom - fresh and light 10/10),  shrimp pork and coriander boiled dumplings (10/10 , you really taste every ingredient), and curry beef boiled dumplings (sounds weird but so good. 10/10). Each serving has 10-12 dumplings so I would recommend sharing. We chose boiled over fried because you taste the flavours better that way. Bill came to $24 for all of that. So worth it!!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Surprised this place is so highly rated. Regarding the Dumplings: Quality is quite mixed and there is very limited variety (e.g., no soup dumplings). I think Qing Hua (just down the street) is a much better option. Regarding Other Menu Items: Had the peanut and celery salad and the spicy cucumber salad. Was very disappointed with both (especially the cucumber salad).No plans to revisit."
/user_details?userid=T9pr92T_WjciqKeZKywo0A,Monica A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Mai Xiang Yuan doesn't look like much when you pass by but I guarantee your belly will be leaving happy as ever after eating their yummy dumplings. I recommend coming here on a empty stomach since the dumplings are very filling and you can't help to order different ones.
/user_details?userid=l6y1_khn2V29gzu_srRlIQ,Grace Y.,"Temple City, CA",4 star rating,The other reviewers were right! This place is the bomb! Where else can you get curry flavored dumplings? We got ours fried but next time I'll try them a different way. We also got the beef with cilantro which was just ok and the leek shrimp and egg steamed dumpling. That was by far the best one. There's only one server doing just about everything. She's quite amazing holding down the fort with a steady flow of customers coming in. I would hire her in my restaurant if I owned one. The place is clean for a busy asian restaurant. Have a little patient since the food comes out slow but it's worth it. Need a dumpling fix? This place is the place to be.
/user_details?userid=FFCBTsP3oL9c5YTOcJnXpA,Tricia C.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,"Came for dumplings after a hard morning's work cheering for the Rock n' Roll marathoners last weekend!  The boiled pork/cabbage dumplings were really great.  The boiled curry beef dumplings were pretty good but could have stood more seasoning, and the pan fried dumplings I was really not a fan of.  The type of dough they use is not suited for pan frying.  The celery and peanuts appetizer was nothing groundbreaking but tasty.Atmosphere and service were about what you'd expect for a Chinatown establishment and they only take cash.  Would come back but would stick to those pork/cabbage dumplings!"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I have been here regularly for several years. Last two visit were really disappointing. The meat was not in good quality. Some chewy bit in the filling seem like tendon.  A lot of soup in the dumplings which is not good sign for freshness.
/user_details?userid=yEP9vNFq3edLldNzhm6hgQ,Leung Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",2 star rating,"It is a very nice place.  Bright and modern ambience.  Staff speaks both English and Mandarin.  OK service.  They are attentive and even point out to other people ordering take out they can order a mix of two favors.The dumplings are eatable.  Why the low score, these dumplings might be awesome in Montreal standard.  The ingredients is fresh and they put effort to put that shrimp in so it looks like it worth it.  But afterall it is mostly appearance.  The flavour is blend.  If you order chive dumplings, you expect that strong herb flavour that will disgust your love ones for the rest of the night.  There is no chive flavour.  It is worse than the Beijing dumplings in Toronto downtown which has been closed down.  Imagine the food is not as good as a closed down restaurant...Also the skin of the wrappers, I cannot put the finger on it but it is mushy.  Not like any decent dumplings I have.  I did finish the order with the help of vinegar (and I am not a vinegar person).P.S. cash only"

I've been coming here for ages and it's still one of my favourite dumpling places in Montreal. They make the best lamb and celery dumplings ever, fried and boiled. Service at this location is very slow though and the demand is constant so on busy days expect to wait maximum an hour. It's crazy but sometimes the dumpling craving is too strong. The upside is if this place is full you are already in Chinatown so you can go to another dumpling place. Cash Only."
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The staff seems really nice and smiley. We ordered the beef curry fried dumplings and while we were waiting for our order I saw a customer leave his hat behind so a staff went running to give it to the customer who left the restaurant. Really nice to see that. The order didnt take that much time either. So all in all, it was a good stop we made for some fried dumplings. I did notice that everyone around us were ordering more of the fried dumplings than the steamed dumplings. The taste of the beef curry dumplings were the bomb!!! Love the way they tasted..so good!"

We always order a bunch with sides of salads (my favorites are the seaweed, mushroom and cucumber). Fried or steamed they are delicious and incredibly inexpensive and fast! I've only been for lunch and I have never been disappointed with both the quality and price. The service is hit and miss (with drinks) but they always get the food out quickly. The dumplings are hand made so I almost feel bad inhaling them but they're so good I'll never stop!"

/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We were in the area and came across this place. Decided to go in for some dumplings. The dumplings were good and basic but nothing out of the ordinary. The sauce was alright as well. Considering the area has so many more places with the same kind of food, I would recommend more research and trying some other place! P.s. They don't take cards and their ATM was out of order. So you will need to go around the corner to get some cash out to pay the bill."
/user_details?userid=Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",4 star rating,"Did someone say dumplings? Shall I admit that a lot of our time was spent in Chinatown during this visit to Montreal?I love dumplings. I'm a dumpling fanatic. Always have been. So, we grabbed 2 orders of dumplings here today: the boiled pork variety and the steamed shrimp, leek and egg style. Both were fabulous.We thought were also going to order soup dumplings, but they don't have them here. Want those slurp-able dumplings? Go next door to Bon Maison...same owners...different dumplings.We figured if we didn't overdo the first round that we could stop by and grab soup dumplings later in the day. Which is exactly what we did. Stand by for that review, too.When we arrived, the place was packed...only one table available pour deux. Parfait!! (Sorry...practicing mon Français).Complimentary tea is provided by the only (seulement) girl (fille) working the whole place. She manages to keep things going...juggling waiting tables, bussing and seating hungry humans.A couple of tips:-cash only. First hint? Cash machine jammed into the already small entrance-don't wait for her to bring the check...just go to the counter and pay (cash) thereOverall, a good pick for dumplings."
/user_details?userid=OLH_Cc2ICmV4ZViA7aRTOA,Cookie D.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Noooooooooo. Not good dumplings. Google reviews are all inaccurate. They're not authentic or on par to Asian standards. They're made to cater the non-Asians, so more like fast food dumplings. I ordered fried pork and mushroom dumplings. The dumpling wrapping was so thick, it tasted like I was eating a ""bao"". Also the dumpling wrapping is not suitable to be pan fried, maybe it can taste decent boiled. The 2 stars is for the very evident mushrooms in the filling - authentic Chinese shrooms! I wouldn't come here if you're looking for authentic dumplings though."
/user_details?userid=zsOC33Os4e2aogadzDCwVQ,Tina T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Dumplings with peanut sauce are apparently a staple of Montreal Chinatown, so we dropped in to try some. This restaurant offers many options for frozen and hand-made dumplings. I definitely recommend hand-made over frozen. We ordered pan fried coconut curry dumplings, the dumplings with peanut sauce, steamed soup dumplings with pork, shrimp and coriander, and lastly, dumplings with beef and chives. They tasted OK, I have had better in other cities. Definitely recommend trying the curry dumplings."
/user_details?userid=PipGc4TdxurGizJ6CKmU7Q,Daniel B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4 star rating,"I love a good, classic, simple boiled dumpling. And Mai Xiang Yuan makes those. The throughput of the kitchen is fantastic, and it makes sure your dumpling filling hasn't been sitting around. That's great.What I don't quite understand is all the love for this place. It's solid. No doubt. But there's nothing here that is quite deserving of all the adulation. When we arrived for dinner, there was a wait to get a table. Other places in Chinatown had no wait. Unless you have your heart set on boiled dumplings, there's really no reason to wait on these. Of course, waiting does help to heighten the anticipation. And you may be hungrier when you finally sit down. Both of those things can work together to make food taste especially good.Maybe that's what is going on at this modest dumpling parlor. Definitely worth a stop. Probably not quite worth the wait. If you see a line, I'd suggest heading down the street for a bowl of noodles first. Then meander back for a second course of dumplings. Then stroll down the main drag and pick up a small sweet for dessert."
/user_details?userid=l1zgZMoiD82HvvsiZVC8Ww,David K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of the best dumpling restaurants in Montreal. The place is small, no-frills, and not always the best service. But the dumplings make up for all of that. They are fresh and oh-so-yummy. We like the boiled dumplings over the fried (we only like the beef curry dumplings fried). The place doesn't take credit card, and they don't like using debit either, so make sure to bring cash."
/user_details?userid=rY_NNP8KiSNQt1OXtznm4g,Ashley G.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Cozy spot in china town to get your dumpling fix. I ordered the #22, shrimp, egg and leek dumplings, fried. The hubby ordered the pork and leek dumplings fried as well as pork soup dumplings. Complimentary tea was served while we waited, it was nothing amazing. Had a couple sips and pushed it to the side. While your waiting, you can also experiment with creating your own dipping sauce for the dumplings as they have vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil on the table. I found the dumplings to be just OK, but the hubby loved his pork and leek dumplings. He tried a bite of mine and said there was something missing. Guess the pork dumplings are the way to go! I ended up pouring soy sauce and vinegar all over the dumplings to add more zing to it. I am glad I checked out this place, but wouldn't rush to go back."
/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",5 star rating,"Escape the ordinary food, the tourist traps, and get yourself some dumplings! We stopped in on our very own food tour, and this was stop 2/3. Dumplings we wanted, and that's what we got.Slowly but surely we were able to figure out how the menu worked at lunch. You can order dumplings steamed or fried, you can order of certain ingredients, and if you want to order a mixed batch, there's actually a special menu that has the mixed batches on there--you don't just piece it together yourself, but accept their predetermined mixes.We were looking to mix veggie and meat, but they don't have any mixes like that, which makes sense. So we just went veggie and honestly, I ain't mad about it. I'm sure the pork dumplings are great, but we devoured an order of vegetarian ones. They only took a few minutes to come out after we ordered, and after we were done, I was stoked that it was pretty cheap. Side note: you go up to the register to pay, don't wait for your bill to be delivered to the table. For what it is, I really can't ask for more. Inexpensive dumplings that hit the spot!"

Cucumber, leek with peanuts, carrot and cabbage with egg.Food : They have an amazing selection of dumplings. 15 dumplings per plate and you can ask for half & half. We tried steamed lamb dumplings, pork with shrimp dumplings and beef curry dumplings. The beef curry was awesome and my personal favorite. The soy sauce mixed with the chilli oil is a great accompaniment for the dumplings.Service : Fast and friendly.Ambience : Not a fancy restaurant. A tiny hole in the wall.Pricing : CAD 6.99 to 9.99 for a portion. That's pretty reasonable. Cash only restaurant .Will I return? : A definite yes. Highly recommend this place."

My boyfriend and I came in looking for an affordable meal, leaving definitely satisfied. The menu is pretty extensive with all different types of dumplings in which you can choose how they're cooked to your liking. I only wish we were with more people so we could try more flavors since each flavor does come with fifteen! We started with the cucumber salad as an appetizer that wasn't too big, but was a nice tangy/refreshing way to start out meal. For our dinner, we went for fried beef curry dumplings and the steamed pork, shrimp, and egg dumplings. Both were delicious but I think I favored the beef curry since it really packs a punch! They do only take cash so come ready or be prepared to use the atm at the entrance. We only had American on us which they excepted and honored the exchange rate which I really appreciated!

Although I was hangrily waiting 30 minutes for them..they were well worth the wait! My boyfriend and I got the pork, leek, egg, and shrimp steamed dumpling and the beef and cilantro fried dumplings. The steamed dumplings were decent, but a huge plus is the amount of meat and fresh shrimp inside. However, the beef and cilantro fried dumplings were my favorite! It was more flavorful and had the perfect amount of meat inside as well. Our total for one plate of 15 dumplings came out to be around $6-$7 US dollars. You definitely can't beat that price for such fresh homemade dumplings!! I wish they had this in Boston."
/user_details?userid=SyzbL8kotVWE4-RWqqAIkQ,Vivian N.,"Ventura, CA",4 star rating,"Pork and mushroom: 5 stars! This was amazing! Tasty and perfectly made. We got this entree steam and I really think maybe they do their steam dumpling better than their fried dumplings. If you like pork and mushroom, I would recommend this! Beef curry dumpling: 3.5 stars. I ordered these fried and they come out like potstickers. It was a bit herby but overall, still good. However, we came near closing time and I feel because of that, they were in a rush. A couple of our dumplings came out undercooked. Cucumber salad: 3.5 stars. A good cold dish compliment to our meal. Seasoned well and garnished with cilantro, carrots, and jalepenos. No soup dumplings at the time we were ordering. I read in the comments and this seems to happen from time to time. I was a bit disappointed as we walked a long way to eat here. Overall, solid dumpling house!"
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"Mai Xiang Yuan is a perfect place to get a hot bowl of dumplings in soup or dumplings fried to perfection on a cold day, which is pretty much everyday in Montreal. The menu is simple enough, as they only serve dumplings. I love fried dumplings with vinegar, so this place did not disappoint. I was actually surprised to discover that I could eat like 12  dumplings by myself. I think if they could improve on one thing, it would be offering noodle dishes to compliment the dumplings. I liked that they offered a wide range of fillings from pork to corn and veggies. You can also buy the dumplings frozen to bring home and make yourself. Service was just ok, but I do believe they are cash only. There are also a few dessert and boba shops in the area for when you're finished with your dumplings."

The only dish I had issue with was the soup dumpling. I ordered thinking they were soup dumpling, not dumpling in soup. That's my bad. Once I saw the bowl I was like ''Well ok'' But the broth was tasteless. I ended up eating the dumpling but left the soup.The spicy cucumber salad was great. I can't believe the sides are this cheap!I would go back with friends, but I would stay clear of the dumpling soup."

The location is clean but not huge but we also did not feel like the tables were too stuck together which was nice. They have a nice selection of dumplings with the option to have them fried or steamed. The prices were sooooo cheap and the dumplings were delicious ! We had the lamb&Coriander (Steamed) and the (Shrimp/Pork) Fried, both were so tasty and really hit the spot. The reason this place didnt get 5 stars is because they were extremely slow with service and even though we specified we were not all sharing all the plates they only brought one plate of dumplings and then we had to wait quite a while for the rest to arrive, there were even people at other tables that were seated/ordered after that ended up getting their plates first.  All in all though , this was a good experience and I would definitely be back for more dumplings !Helpful Tip - Cash only !!!!

The fillings are all great, I prefer them fried (crispy on the bottom, nice chew on the top). Most dishes are around $8, which is food because they are cash only. ATM in the lobby charges a reasonable $1.50 fee, and the do take US dollars. Service is fast, a good place to go for lunch if you're at the conference center.Protip: even if you're not a spice person, try the chili oil. The peppers are toasted before, so it is incredibly fragrant, rather than all hot."

I grew up in a household that frequently made dumplings from scratch, and I can safely say that I've never been disappointed here. I've been frequenting this place since my first year at university, and one thing that I really love is their frozen dumpling takeout option - it was probably this that won my loyalty. Every once in a while I'll go and buy two or three bags of dumplings (usually #5, if I remember correctly) and throw them in the freezer for later. They're super convenient when you're too lazy to cook, and they're a lot cheaper than takeout. At the restaurant, you can get your dumplings either steamed or fried. Their dumplings are hand wrapped by cooks behind the counter, which guarantees their freshness. There's a huge variety to choose from, but not all of them can be bought frozen. The only drawback is that everything is cash only."

Re-established right next to the old and abandoned restaurant, the new 2.0 is nicely decorated with slightly more seating. What's more appealing is that now they have a new dumpling mascot rooting for Mai Xiang. The food has also reached a new level of tastiness as well. With variety of proteins and vegetables available in addition to different methods of preparation, these dumplings can satisfy even the most difficult cynic. Till this day, Mai Xiang stands strong and upholds a respectable standard of quality and service despite few entry level competitors around the block."

/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Three full days in Montreal. We ate here twice. What was it that got us coming back?, Yelp asks. The food, and only the food. The service was atrocious.And yet - four stars, all because those delicious steamed or pan-fried balls of meat and veggies more than made up for the lack of service. As my husband jokingly said on our way there the second night, ""We're on our way to delicious dumplings and horrible service!""So, night one - we found this place because of Yelp (thanks, fellow Yelpers!) It was within walking distance from our hotel, and it was open. We showed up at about 7 pm that night, and though they were kind of full, we were given a table near the window right away.That's about as good as it got, as far as service goes. We were at the table for maybe two minutes - menus open, in the middle of discussing what we'd like to order - when we were rudely interrupted by one of the waitresses demanding our order. And it was a demand, too. Nothing kind or nice about it. ""What you order?!"", she barked at us, as we stared up at her in amazement. My husband - ever the diplomat - politely told her that we'd need a few more minutes. She turned on her heel and stamped away before we could ask for beverages. Once we finally decided what we wanted - one order of the curried beef, pan fried, and one order of the steamed pork and pickled cabbage - we were left to sit. We had to flag a waitress down, and even then, she got distracted halfway to our table. Our request for green tea was flatly denied - something about ""not having it"" that night - and our back-up request for water was ignored for almost ten minutes.The wait for the food that night was interminable, as well. I was two minutes from getting up to ask about our order when the first plate appeared in front of us (dropped like it was hot while the waitress scurried away). We were left with no chopsticks and no napkins, and of course it took several minutes to get someone's attention for that.The first plate we were given was the pork and pickled cabbage. Every plate comes with 15 dumplings. Fifteen hot, delectable packets of goodness. And let me tell you people - it IS goodness!Every table has a selection of sauces, which allows you to concoct your own brew. Shoyu, vinegar, chili oil - it all went into my little dish, and it was divine!I rather enjoyed the pan-fried curry dumplings, but my husband was more about the boiled version. They were both truly delicious, and took some of the sting out of the horrible service.Paying is quite the adventure. You're not given a check - you're expected to go to the register. Once there, the distracted guy (who was on the phone both times we paid) will pluck a receipt from his till and present it to you to pay. He was right both times - bully for him - but again, don't expect any kind of friendliness or thanks for the business.Oh yes - they're a cash only establishment. They have an ATM right at the entrance, so that's handy.Second night there was more of the same as far as service goes (with less reason, as it wasn't nearly as packed the first time we went). We did two orders of the boiled dumplings this time, and they were just as delicious.And let me tell you - it may not look like a lot, but two orders (30 dumplings) fills a person up. Even a glutton like me!"

Take the subway or walk because you'll never find parking.Decor & Service: The new place is 3x bigger than the old place and guess what? NO carpet! It's much cleaner and there is more room to move around, unlike the previous place which was super cramped. You don't have as good a view of the dumpling ladies now, but if you stand right at the cash, you can see them in action. The cashier might give you strange looks though.Food: I ordered the steamed pork+shrimp+coriander dumplings and they were delicious. Freshly made and steaming hot, these dumplings were like little baskets of soupy goodness that I literally inhaled, they were so good. The dumplings were super flavorful and you could taste the fresh coriander - definitely a plus because I love coriander.  I can guarantee fresh dumplings at this place - if you don't believe me, stop by and see for yourself. The lovely ladies in the kitchen prepare each dumpling by hand, (almost) right on front of you. Just peek through that plexiglass and watch the magic happen.Price: Pretty fair - for 15 good-size dumplings, it'll cost you a whopping $8.49+tax."

Top that with hot tea on the side, perfect meal. I also ordered their seaweed salad and loved it. Now, if you've never had seaweed before, you might find it tasting weird and fishy so just be aware.It's cool because you can literally see them making dumplings while you eat in the back.

The breakdown: The good:The boiled lamb and onion dumplings we ordered had pretty good flavor and the filling was juicy and moist. Each order comes with 15 dumplings and was quite a filling meal. Prices are some of the lowest I've seen for a dumpling house. The eh: I don't recommend the fried dumplings at all. Ours came out charred and the filling was dry as a board. The flavor was hugely masked by the dough wrapper and (I can't believe I'm about to say  this) they didn't use enough oil to fry the potstickers. As a result, the wrapper of the dumpling was suuuuper dry and tough. No bueno. My take away is that the dumplings are probably better boiled here. The moisture of the filling remains locked in the dumpling and you don't feel like you're hacking your teeth away like we did with the pan fried ones."

Mai Xiang was recommended to me by locals and it does not disappoint! It's a small spot that tends to be packed for dinnertime. The dumplings are made in house and each order comes with a decent serving (I'd estimate 15-20 dumplings). Definitely enough for me to eat and have a leftover to snack on later. Authentic Chinese dumplings! My favorite is the pork and mushroom with a side of the cucumber jellyfish. It seems like somewhat of a family operation so staff is minimal but they get you your food ASAP and you go up to the back counter to pay when you're done. CASH ONLY!

Don't forget to squirt some vinegar to cut through the richness; that takes it to a whole other level. At lunch the salads are $1, take advantage of that especially the cabbage/wasabi salad, or order all of them; for $1, what have you got to lose except find yet another addiction. From the outside it doesn't look like much but if you are in fact a legitimate dumpling fan, passing this place up would be a huge mistake.

The vegetable dumpling we got also lacked somewhere, couldn't pinpoint it. The best would be the traditional pork and leek dumplings, boiled.

/user_details?userid=hR6dUJqimBHwIKssts6VOQ,Lillian C.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"This place was jammed packed Friday night. Like every other dumpling joint, this is a hole in the wall. Cramped quarters elbow to elbow with fellow diners locals and tourists alike. A plate of dumplings will run you about 10 dollars more or less, with 15 dumplings per plate. If you're not insanely hungry, one plate per person would do. I stuck to pan-fried pork and leek and steamed pork mushroom and shrimp because I never mess with the ""classics"". The wait is a tad on be long side but you get free hot tea to tie you over (mine was served in a 12 oz drinking glass and replaced with another glass promptly after finishing. Interesting to say the least.)The filling of the pork and leek was more flavorful of the two but I preferred the steamed style. There was something about the way the dumplings tasted that was a tad ""off"" about the pan-fried dumplings. Maybe it was old fry oil or something but it was too savory / salty on the outside to really appreciate the flavor inside. NYC's prosperity dumpling blows theirs out of the water undoubtably. And call me a gringo, but I prefer Sriracha over hot chili oil on my dumplings. The skin wasn't too hot either (I like a slightly thicker skin with an Al-dente chew). I wish the shrimp was ground up finely in the shrimp and pork dumplings- it's nice to know they put a substantial amount of succulent tasty shrimp in their dumplings but I think the flavor is better when the shrimp are ground, but that's just me.  I'm not breaking my pelvis to return here but it's pretty solid. Not Prosperity or Vanessa's dumpling level good though. Don't look down on the floor because it's carpet matted with old dirt, gravel and other grime from the streets of Montreal. Im sure they attempt to clean it and is in no way a commentary about the hygiene of the food but I would suggest pulling up the carpet and just having bare carpet for the customer's dining pleasure.

In fact, sadly, I'm not so sure that any other Chinese restaurants period match up with it. If it was located in a city that had an abundance of good Chinese food it might be considered more average, but considering the sad state of Chinese food in Montréal, this will have to do.I came in with a huge dumpling craving, so I ordered two plates - one of pork, leek, shrimp, and egg dumplings (boiled) and another one of beef and curry onion dumplings (fried). While the pork dumplings (a standard in my household) aren't as good as the ones that my parents make (but then again, every Chinese kid thinks their parents make the best dumplings), they were still tasty, juicy, and freshly made. They also used quality ingredients and whole pieces of shrimp are visible in every dumpling. The beef and curry onion dumplings were nicely fried on the bottoms and were a crisp alternative to their boiled counterparts, and the curry onion provided a nice flavoring to the beef, and they complemented each other very well. By the way, they also serve free tea here, just like I'm used to back home, in these cute teapots with their logo on it! I come here every once in a while when I feel like walking down the hill, but every time is so worth it. If you ever need to satisfy yourself with warm food or don't have family around to celebrate Chinese New Year with, this place makes suitable dumplings that are guaranteed to fill you up and sooth your soul."

The cucumber side dish (referred to as a salad) was passable.  2 stars.  I don't know why the guy took away our cucumber plate so quickly when we hadn't even finished eating.  1 star.  If this is a solid four star in Montreal, I feel sad for Montrealers.  Montreal isn't known for Chinese food anyways."

The variety, taste, quality, freshness, all were outstanding!A word about kids: I had a somewhat fussy 8-month-old and a very, very upset 2-year-old who was acting out horrendously and in her hyper flurry knocked over her water within the first 5 minutes. The server was so sweet and kind and understanding and brought her out a cut up fresh peach to snack on while we ordered and waited for our food. 180 degree different child. The food was not super fast but was worth the wait! Each order of dumplings comes with 15, and for an extra $.50 you can split the order into 2 different flavors. For another $.50 they will fry them. My husband, daughter, and I split 2 orders, each divided into two flavors. I'll rank them in order of MY preference, but they were all 10/10. (My husband couldn't decide which he liked best and liked them all equally.)1. Beef with curry onions 2. Pork with Chinese cabbage (my 2-year-old's favorite)3. Beef with coriander4. Pork with mushroomsWe only have 3 days here in Montreal and have already decided that we will be going back for more!!!"

Everything is fresh and so tasty. Love the sauce that you can mix at ur taste right at your table. They do need to get cold water because all they seem to have is room temperature. Another reason why I only gave 4 stars is they only have one salad left on their menu they use to have a few different one but last time I was there all they had was celery and peanut salad and it might have been good but I did not try it.I do love that they make the dumplings as you order them and you can see the ladies making them so you know you are not getting frozen stuff

These delicious little bundles are packaged by hand and delivered hot with friendly & fast service. Now I hope your not expecting anything fancy because this little 15 table restaurant is your quintessential ""hole-in-the-wall""! You don't have fancy art, the wallpaper is torn, the bathrooms are not spotless but their dumplings are magic!We ordered 3 types of boiled dumplings; pork & cabbage, pork & leek, and lamb. We also ordered the fried beef & curry dumplings b/c our server said they were tastier than the boiled. All came hot and steamy to our table on plates with no added decorations or garnishes. They were just simply DELISH!After all that I just couldn't get enough dumplings if you can believe it so I ordered soup with dumplings too. I meant to order ""soup dumplings"" but somehow it got lost in translation so I had delicious broth with pork dumplings. Still, vey good.Dinner for 4 was under $60 with tip including free tea.

Maybe I was spoiled as a kid because my moms handmade dumplings were an often part of my childhood...but I was not insanely impressed. They were still good though! First off, this place is gritty and cheap. Appetizers are a mere $3-$4 and each dumpling dish is around $7-8 for 15 dumplings. It doesn't look like they accept credit card and they do a 1.2 exchange rate instead of the current 1.36. The most common ones everyone ordered was the pot sticker like dumplings. They looked delicious from pictures but were a little dry inside. The steamed dumplings were my favorite. Unfortunately they ran out of soup dumplings :( We tried everything from pork, beef, and lamb. Def go with the pork options that have a star next to them.Overall this place is a good but my moms homemade dumplings are similar. If you've never had authentic Chinese dumplings, you would probably love this place!"

This place is trying to make the most money out of tourists like me. I ordered 3 different dumplings and a Sapporo. I ended up paying $49 without tip. Since it is cash only, I didn't think of asking for a receipt but now I realize I should have. Knowing that each dumpling costs about 8-9$, I don't know how they managed to charge us 49! Plus, the service was terrible, not a slight smile or any 'how is everything'. I can see they only care about running the business. Plus, only cash means no tax. Only cash and no receipt. Great business. Keep up the good work guys!"

We never got the coke or the cucumber salad (wasn't surprised based on server interactions), but we left happy about the fried dumpling experience."

I've never been to a place that only had dumplings before so I was happy to see there was a vegetarian option and asked to try an order half steamed and half pan fried. As they are made fresh they come out in a different style depending how you order them. The pan fried ones were not greasy at all and just done on one side. It was neat to watch them making the dumplings in the back and they were pretty affordable.

I come here at least once every time I visit Montreal and they've never disappointed. There's something fantastic about a dumpling that's not only packed with amazing freshness, but with little bit of soup/gravy that spills into your mouth your first bite. They do seem to emphasize pork dumplings, but also have beef and lamb. I don't think they have a chicken option. So be aware if you have dietary restrictions. The pork dumpings are pretty darn good though. I have to say I liked the steamed dumplings better than the fried ones. But I think it's hard to go wrong either way. Pick what you're in the mood for. This isn't a place that really has a best or signature type of dumplings. Also be sure to bring cash! Someday they'll hopefully start accepting credit, but until then, picking up some cash beforehand is worth it.Mix with spicy oil, vinegar, and soy sauce for an awesome dip!"

Also, overheard a girl saying that she had the fried dumplings before and thought it was gross because it was oily... what does she think fried means?I wanted to come here because of the more unique dumpling ingredient combos versus the norm of beef, pork, chicken. I knew I had to try the lamb dumplings. The meat was definitely very pungent like lamb is supposed to be, but there were little pieces of bones, so that was not too delightful. I would have liked to try more of the unique combos like beef curry, but my bf likes his staples so we got the shrimp, eggs, and leek dumplings. Of course, it was mostly leek and eggs.Get an appetizer of the cold cucumber salad, and you'll have a nice meal for 2 for about $20."

Pan fried version is mushy - not the typical pan fried dumplings. Warning: it takes at least 30 mins to get your order. We sat a long time waiting for our food.

The food was beyond better than the service but you cannot have great food and trash service. It's not even worth it. You would've been better off trying a different restaurant with mediocre food and better service than this restaurant. We had a waiter who did not understand us and who messed up our order multiple times to the point where we were waiting an extreme amount of time just to get orders of food. We waited way too long just for orders of rice and it was not worth it. They need to do a better job at figuring out how to run their restaurant they don't even show you how to grill the food it just was not a great experience at all and I deeply recommend for anyone who is thinking about going to this place to try somewhere else first.

The only reason I would knock it down half a star was for the ambiance and set up. It's pretty cramped and the tables and chairs were practically falling apart. There are these door shutters when you walk in that seem really odd and kinda weirded me out. So that's my only complaint about the place. But once you get past the decor and wobbly chairs...the food is outstanding!We tried it because it had so many amazing reviews on yelp. And it sure didn't disappoint! The main complaint we had was that we were too full to try more!!!We went around 12:30 on Saturday and we were seated right away and served hot tea, which was nice. We ordered what was recommended by many here: the cucumber salad, the celery salad and then the beef and curry fried dumplings and then shrimp, egg and leek fried dumplings. Everything came super fast...like less then 15 minutes total. The salads were shockingly amazing! They didn't look like they would be....but honestly...so so so good! Then the dumplings were next level! Especially the shrimp and leek. The flavours were out of this world!!! I personally preferred them much more then the beef and curry. They were still great but a little overpowering on the curry.Overall, we were super impressed with this place and would eat here again in a heartbeat! Tips: bring cash. They don't take credit or have an ATM. Hubby had to go next door."

However I wasn't going to let this get between me and some stellar dumplings. We tried both pure steamed lamb and chive and fried pork and cabbage. The lamb and chive dumplings were amazing, strong flavors and good size. These were rounder dumplings. I tend to poke them to allow the boiling water and steam to escape.

A few main streets chalk full of dumplings, bahn mi's, and other delicacies. The Yelp reviews were positive and Risa D stamped this one as the best so, done.The dumplings were amazing. But, just a heads up, this place ONLY serves dumplings. There are a few salad apps but, you are here for the dumplings and dumplings only. We went with all steamed varieties ranging from pork and leek to lamb and coriander (!!!) and finished it off with beef and onion. With 15 dumplings per order and at about $7 per order you get a lot of bang for your buck. Sweet. All were fabulous, I do want to highlight the lamb dumplings which I don't think I've ever had before and happened to be the winner winner chicken dinner of the meal. The other dumplings were just as great but the lamb had this extra kick to the meat. I also want to highlight that these dumplings were plump dumplings. Plump with juicy meat and with the skins being thin, the filling flavor really came through. Praise the dumpling lord, that's what I'm talking about. This place is super authentic with lovely lil' ladies in the back rollin' those dumplings as you eat. So fresh.My one gripe was they wouldn't give us water. We asked twice. Water never came.

For the dumplings, we went for 2 kinds. The pork and cabbage, and the shrimp, pork and mushroom. The shrimp pork and mushroom was definitely our favorite. It had more complex flavors and textures, and was nothing short of a party in my mouth. The pork and cabbage reminded me so much of xiao long bao's. The pork inside had a super super fine consistency and packed with juices. Each bite was practically bursting with simple but delicious comforting flavors.

The only actually vegetarian dumpling on the menu is ""tomato and egg"", which I've never heard of before but sounds interesting. Alas, we couldn't even get that, because they were out! But the waitress went and conferred with the kitchen and reported back to us that there were mushroom, cabbage, and cellophane noodle-filled dumplings we could have instead.We ordered one order fried and one boiled (15 dumplings per order). They were delicious: the skin is excellent -- not too thick, not too thin -- and the filling good but not really notable. The size was just right, too.We also ordered the cucumber salad, which was good, although not properly chopped up (not a big deal, just kind of an amateur-hour move). The general ambiance is not much to speak of, but it's not so bare bones as to feel unwelcoming/depressing. They take credit cards, but charged us a 5% fee for our American card. They offered to take U.S. cash, which would have made sense for the exchange rate, but we didn't have enough of that on hand either.As someone else mentioned, they don't serve tea, which is kind of a bummer.

They come 15 to a serving, and were delivered in a neat little basket.  They keep soy sauce and vinegar on the table, for you to mix your dipping sauce. We shared the egg and shrimp dumplings. They were cooked to perfection, with the seams holding well together. The degree to which the individual flavors presented themselves was mesmerizing.

I give three stars because the server seemed very rushed in the way she was talking to us, while we would have preferred a gentler touch to the service. Furthermore, she was rather dismissive of our attempts to speak French, and clearly (and not politely) switched to English. (Surely our French can't be that bad?)

The line at the noodle place down the street was super long, so we decided to try our luck at the dumpling spot instead. Thankfully, no line, and we were seated right away. Strange, we thought, for a Friday night, but no complaints there. Ordered the seaweed salad, the steamed lamb and onion dumplings and the steamed shrimp pork and leek dumplings. Everything tastes wonderful. Our gripe was the service. The server insisted we get full orders of both dumplings (as opposed to the option where you can split the order into two flavors), saying that one plate wasn't enough for two people. Well when we received our orders, we'll, there were 30 dumplings total. And I don't know about you, but that's a lot of dumplings between two people. In other words, we felt like we got hustled so that the server could make an extra buck. And we actually felt a little sick afterwards cause we ate too much. But whatever. Let's just get our bill. Except the server hadn't even checked on us since we got our food. No ""everything okay?"" or ""would you like more tea?"" Basic stuff. Anyways, just went straight to the cashier to pay for my bill (which I HATE doing at a restaurant - former waiter pet peeve), and that was that. All that to say, the food was great, but the experience left a little to be desired, and there are enough dumpling spots in this town for me to take my business elsewhere."

Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.  First, it was 90 degrees in Montreal and this restaurant had no AC. It was sweltering  and sweat was pouring off of all of us as we waited for our food. The service was terribly slow--in fact another customer ended up giving us his menu when he realized we had been seated, but had not been visited by our waiter. Normally with service this slow, I would have walked out, but the promise of delicious dumplings kept me from leaving. Finally our order arrived and my boyfriend and I just stared at it. The pan fried dumplings we had been waiting all day to try were stuck together and burned. We took a couple of bites and the taste just wasn't right. It was bland and dry.

Halfway around the world and thousands of miles from China, this indistinct dumpling shop situated just inside Chinatown along Saint-Laurent makes some of the best dumplings you will ever find. Even among the dozens of dumpling shops I frequented over the years in China, few can compare. They know their dumplings here, and with a dozen small tables and a growing reputation queuing for a table is becoming commonplace. Hot tea and menus arrive as the skilled waitress juggles bussing tables, serving food and manning the cash register. Order placed, I wait and watch as the kitchen staff stuff fresh dumplings, racing to fill my order.The pork dumplings with cilantro and shrimp are out of this world. Each one is packed with juicy ground pork that's been mixed with cilantro and molded around a large shrimp. The pork dumplings with cabbage are classic and the beef dumplings with shiitake mushrooms are another favorite. Fifteen steaming dumplings are placed in front of me.  Before I dig in, I fill a small bowl with vinegar and pepper oil. The skins are a little sticky where dry and a little slippery where wet. Grabbing them with chopsticks can challenge even an expert, but I've learned that when all else fails, stab them. After a quick dip in the vinegar, I'm conflicted, two bites are required but I'd rather not wear my dinner. I'm hungry and not proud so I devour the entire delicious package. I repeat the procedure fourteen more times before I sit back in a glutinous haze and sip a fresh cup of tea.I'll be back for more. In fact I think I'll get an order of raw dumplings to go and cook them at home."

Mai Xiang Yuan has great dumpling, not to mention the variety. I guaranty that they'll have something for every one from plain Jane pork to my favorite Oyster and pickled cabbage. In my opinion the best way to enjoy this kind of restaurant is with a group of friends so you can each get a different type of dumplings and share them, but if you're on your own you can always get them to give you two kind of dumpling per basket.There isn't much to say about the service other then it's like most places in Chinatown quick and efficient but without much conversation.  I memory serves me correctly they close early as well, so if you have a craving for dumpling past 9 pm you might be out of luck.This is a small place with only a dozen or so tables and what feels like hundreds of waving cats.

As someone making food for other people, that is completely unacceptable. In addition, when someone spilled a glass of water by accident, the server just wiped the water onto the floor instead of cleaning it up As for the food, the dumplings were good but nothing out of this world. We tried pork with peppers pan fried, and they weren't even fried correctly. The skin was hard and had a chalky consistency.

We eat Chinese food regularly (there are tons of Chinese restos in Toronto), and have to say that this little place isn't fancy and the service is rather brisk (but what Chinese place has good service?) - but it's ALL worth it for the delicious handcrafted dumplings! Here's the rundown...PLACE: A small and rather unappealing-looking place. It was packed at 6:30pm on a Friday night... Always a good sign! No  children though, so we doubted they had a high chair for our infant but when asked, the waitress brought a little booster chair over.  FOOD: The menu is 95% dumplings, with a few small appetizers to round it out. Honestly, I don't think anyone goes for the appetizers which included a cucumber salad. This made me laugh as it seemed like an afterthought. You can get the dumplings boiled or fried. We got them boiled and they came out piping hot. The wrapping was very fine and slightly toothsome. The filling was soft and well-seasoned. The only (slight) complaint is that although we ordered 3 types of dumplings (pork, seafood and beef), they all tasted very similar. All very good though! It costs only $8 for a plate of 15 yummy little dumplings... So cheap!!  I would say one plate is a good-sized portion for an individual. SERVICE: They came and filled up water fairly fast when we arrived. Food came out within about 10 minutes. They weren't too sensitive about safety as they kept placing the steaming hot plates right in front of the infant. But I guess they are just rushed. All in all, this place is a gem!

We dragged our Halloween hangovers here at about 4pm, the place was half filled. I don't understand what the comments are below suggesting this place is kind of dirty, we found it very normal really, perhaps a teeny bit better even than what you'd expect in chinatown.It's all dumplings really, and some salad starters. We had lettuce with peanut sauce and celery with peanuts for starters. Super yummy. Then for mains, we ordered three types of dumplings: beef in soup (10), beef curry (15) and shrimp/egg (15). And they were just amazing. Service was great and on point. Vibe is nice a semi-quiet and chill. Food came at appropriate times. Tea was included. And the bill was $36 after tax.Total score. Will definitely, definitely be returning here. We loved it."

How when at first searching for this restaurant - it was easy to miss. ( perhaps because I'm from out of town. ) That ordering a glass of ice water meant waiting a while to only get cold tap water. The girl who goes around refilling the tea only came when we first sat down and around the time we were leaving. No one really came to check up on how everything was.

Having eaten here once. Just once. I don't want anyone else to know where it is. I want to save it for myself but here am I. Our party of six got seated in a short while. It's good for groups. Six is a nice big size. Eight would be pushing it. You have your standard menu with dumplings broken out by main protein categories: pork, beef, lamb, and seafood. They also have dumplings in soup, not to be confused with soup dumplings. The former they have. The later they do not. We ordered beef curry which was right on curry flavor and spicy such that the beef was not lost in it. We also ordered the pork and pickled Chinese cabbage, which was the table favorite, and some seafood one that was good but underwhelming. Half of our order was steamed and the other fried. You should know fried dumplings are a buck and fifty cents extra per order, which is worth it, although dumplings were good enough as it. I would eat it raw and uncooked if I had them. It didn't look like you could order anything wrong. So what you really like is going to be personal. I'm ready to go back and see what can beat beef & curry one for me. Make sure to bring your A game with your chopsticks! The steam and water makes it a bit tricky eating it. And be careful of the water trapped from the steaming inside the dumplings. It is hot."

Don't be afraid of the spice jar, and don't be afraid to hit the soy sauce hard -- it's definitely not even close to full strength. At first I was put off by the idea of soy sauce that's watered down, but I imagine it's necessary to make the dipping sauce work without giving you a lethal dose of sodium.As I write this, I'm getting the craving.

With the advice of the Yelpers we went here for what were supposed to be amazing dumplings (spoiler: we were not disappointed). It was busy, but a table opened just as we arrived. The service is lacking, but this is a really casual place and we weren't in a hurry. We ordered #20 boiled, those are the shrimp, pork, egg, and leek dumplings and the #2 fried, those are the pork and mushroom. The #20 were incredible, a light but flavorful taste and the boiling was the perfect choice. The dumplings didn't have that watery feel you get in some places either. The fried pork and mushroom arrived next and were a good counterpoint to the light #20s. The fried bottoms had a nice texture and went well with the flavors, but we agreed that maybe we should have ordered them boiled. They were still quite good. I keep thinking about picking picking up a few ordered just before we leave to go home."

The bar for service and ambiance is shifted accordingly for the hole in the wall places, but I still expect at least to be acknowledged and given a menu after 15 minutes of seating! I tried to catch the waitresses's attention multiple times and when I did make eye contact with her and said ""Hi can I get menus please"" I was ignored. WTF? I had to desperately flag down a passing waiter guy for menus (they have 1 female and 1 male waiter/bus boy that night).As for cleanliness, I do not expect to be seated on a chair with grease and the napkin/chopsticks holder to have hair in it at any restaurant. Also napkins were all over the floor at the table we were seated.Now the positive: The food was amazing. We got the pan fried curry beef dumpling. It was crispy, juicy and the dough was chewy. The meat to dough ratio was perfect. The curry in the beef flavours it nicely, it was not overwhelming. Just a note, pan fried dumplings cost $1.50 more.The boiled pork, mushroom and shrimp dumpling was also great, the dough was a nice consistency and the filling juicy. There was even some soup inside the dumplings reminding me a little of shanghai soup dumplings.Overall, great food, poor service and general cleanliness."

You can see the adorable group of women filling dumplings in a row, decked out in baseball caps and bright pink polo shirts, in the back kitchen thanks to the large glass window :)The hot tea was very pleasant to have since it was a chillier day than we've had yet, so we kept warm while we waited. With only two of us, and 15 dumplings per order, we could only try two different ones, so we went with the steamed pork and mushroom, and the pan fried curry beef. The pork ones came out first, and boy are they DELICIOUS! The beef curry ones were up next, and YUM - a bit juicier than the pork for some reason, so we had to be careful with each bite. You have soy sauce, vinegar, and hot chili oil on each table to create your own dipping sauce. Service is fine since even with a small space they fill up immediately and then a line forms outside, so they do try to politely get you to leave asap - or at least that's how I felt.

Service was brisk but friendly.The food took a bit of time to arrive, but seeing as they make the dumplings to order, I wouldn't complain. We ordered pork/leek (boiled), beef/onion (fried), and tried to order the pork/shrimp/mushroom, but they were out of mushroom, so they offered to substitute cilantro instead. The cilantro flavor pretty much overpowered any other flavor in the dumpling, but if you like cilantro, that would be the dumpling for you.  Personally I would have preferred the mushroom.That said, the other dumplings were absolutely heavenly: fresh and flavorful, skins just thick enough to hold the dumpling securely, but not so thick as to be doughy. For dipping sauces, there were soy sauce, vinegar, and hot sauce on the table, but the dumplings barely needed anything. Seriously the best dumplings I've eaten in recent memory. The boiled ones were soft, delicate, and pillowy, whereas the fried ones were tougher in texture but with a beautiful, crunchy, golden side.  The dumplings come fifteen to an order, so make sure you get there hungry, or are willing to share.

They are about $8-10 each. Each dish contains 15 dumplings, unless indicated otherwise. For $1.5 extra, you can have them fried. Otherwise, they're boiled (which is much healthier).Each dumpling has the perfect amount of filling. You might burn your mouth so be very careful, but the right way to eat it is to pop the whole thing in your mouth so that you get all the juice, as opposed to the juice being wasted on your plate. The dumplings didn't have too much fat, which I appreciated; they use fresh, lean ingredients. Although it's common sense, but be careful, it's hot, and the juice might scorch your tongue or the roof of your mouth.Order a salad to go with your dumplings ($4 for cucumber salad); it will really refresh your mouth after each dumpling, ready to take on the next dumpling.A lot of locals come here; alone, in pairs, families or groups.

Both were de-li-cious, to my humble opinion (Although i am not necessarily a connoisseur in chinese food, so do not quote me on this!). My favourite out of the two dishes was definitely the fried pork dumplings - They were crisp, the filling was delicious and, basically, a pleasure in the mouth.

We were a little cramped.)We could have ordered just four - five dishes was a lot of food! All of the dumplings were very good, but standard dumplings - nothing really different that you should obviously order or risk missing out. The only obvious miss was the dumplings with pork and oysters - they were very fishy without much additional flavour. We got two orders fried and three orders steamed for variety, which I'd recommend. The fried dumplings are EXTREMELY hot when they come to the table - don't think you can bite into them right away or you will burn the roof of your mouth.

If I hadn't been looking for it, I wouldn't even have noticed this tiny spot in the middle of busy Chinatown. We got in late in the afternoon around 2 and the place was empty. There were 3 ladies in the kitchen window and one waitress that greeted us and brought us tea and menus. We ordered the curry beef and onion dumplings fried, and pork, shrimp leek and egg steamed. The steamed came out first. They were the perfect temperature to pop in your mouth whole without burning yourself. Light, full of fresh filling and lightly seasoned, I could have eaten these all day. The curry beef were hot due to the pan frying but the waitress warned us so we munched happily on the pork while they cooled a bit. The beef was perfectly seasoned with curry, crispy, juicy and so flavorful they didn't even require dipping sauce!The fresh dough is soft and slightly chewy and the perfect thickness to hold in the goodies inside while not giving you just a mouthful of dough. Each table has vinegar, soy sauce and hot pepper oil so you can mix your own custom dipping sauces. For 2 huge plates of dumplings it was under $20.

/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",4 star rating,"Really good Chinese dumplings restaurant in Chinatown. We came here primarily because of Yelp, but also because we were just walking and this place stood out. The restaurant itself is quite small and very crowded. Dumplings are freshly made by workers in the kitchen, which is available for the public to see in. The menu, salad, dumplings, dumplings in soup, and dessert. Everything is inexpensive and delicious. We started off with the celery and peanuts salad. The celery was a bit soft, but went well with the black peanuts. Served in a very mild vinegar-based sauce. Being around dumplings so much, like in Flushing, NY, there are so many places that all show expertise in their dumpling making process. This is what this place reminds me of. Dumplings are an art, and if you can make quality dumplings one after the other, then there is a quality Chinese dumpling restaurant. At this restaurant, you combine the soy sauce and the vinegar together, just like the sauce for eating soup dumplings. We had ordered the pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings, the beef and leek dumplings, and the pork and shrimp dumplings in soup. By far, the best were the pork and Chinese cabbage. They had the most flavor. I prefer dumplings to be boiled/steamed, so the skin is very soft and rich in flavor. Extremely hot. The broth of the soup was very plain, barely any taste. So I combined the soup with my soy sauce and vinegar mixture, and in an instant, it was at least 5 times better. The beef was very tender, and with the leeks made a great dumpling. They aren't necessarily soup dumplings, but when you bite into them, a little broth comes out, which was really delicious. My only concerns were service, since they weren't friendly at all, and the dumplings themselves, since they didn't truly stand out from any other dumpling I have had in the past."

Montreal at night was a little challenging to find a place we could go with kids - we stumbled upon this little gem in Chinatown, and had 2 very happy kids! There was a bit of a wait to get in but well worth it. Food is fresh and delicious, prices are very reasonable, and the service was wonderful (their internet was down, I went outside to find a bank machine while my family ate, and the waitress chased me down in the street to tell me not to worry, the internet was working again!)

I yelped around my hotel and came across this place. When I arrived on a saturday evening, the place was packed, but they cleared away a table in the back for me. I ordered the beef curry onion dumplings (recommended fried) and the pork and shrimp dumplings (boiled). I also had the cucumber and jellyfish app. The dumplings were juicy, flavorful, and filling. The pork and shrimp were definitely better than the beef ones, but both were tasty nonetheless. My only criticism was the fact that it's cash only and the servers were not very attentive (received app last and water was never replenished). The food itself was good, but when looking at the entire experience, there's definitely room for improvement."

As it had taken  40 minutes from ordering for my meal to arrive I ate it anyway as I had to get back to work. Needless to say I burned my mouth. On paying I told the server my meal had been burned and all she said was ""sorry"", no offer to comp, no offer of anything else, in fact. I give a rating of three as the food is normally quite good but rest assured that if there is a lunch rush they may screw up your food with no compunction about it. I won't be returning."

Of course, it doesn't compare to some of the restos in Toronto but it will do while waiting for my next road trip. The dumplings served are not xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and are served in a variety of different fillings. All you need is a little vinegar and chili paste as dipping.We had the shrimp, egg and leek steamed dumplings and the curried beef pan fried dumplings. Both were very flavorful and so juicy that you should really eat it all in one bite unless you want to risk squirting the juice all over you. I will need to go back to try out the rest of the menu.My only complain is that I wish they would give complementary salad as well as serve the dumplings in portion of 10, rather than 15.

/user_details?userid=fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,Bailey Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"We were lucky enough to stumble upon this place while trying to find a lunch place in Chinatown. Good thing my mom had a craving for dumplings. This restaurant serves dumplings and also hand-pulled noodles, but today they were all out of the noodles, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. We ordered three plates of steamed dumplings, but when my mom saw another table eating pan-fried potstickers, we added a fourth order. At first, I thought the dumplings weren't worth $9 since we got very similar dumplings in NYC for 20 cents each. But, each plate had 12-15 dumplings and they had a lot more choices in what they were stuffed with. My favorite was the beef curry steamed dumpling. The pan-fried cilantro beef potstickers were also amazing. We also tried the shrimp and beef steamed dumplings and the regular pork dumplings. I am a big fan of chili oil and they seem to have a house-made one ready at your table. Add some red vinegar to that and it is the perfect dipping sauce for your dumplings. The cool thing about this place is that the dumplings are made fresh and ready to order. They don't start stuffing or wrapping them until they are ordered. You can see through the kitchen window how they stuff and fold them too! The service is great and the guy who took our orders could speak five different languages, which is pretty accommodating to all the different tourists they get. Back in San Diego, I loved this tiny little restaurant called the Dumpling Inn. This place is definitely better and should be aptly crowned the Dumpling Hotel Resort and Spa."

/user_details?userid=aDBC325GPsbrqoZ-HL6qMw,Two C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,"A true gem, comparable to the best dumplings I have had in a restaurant. It is a tiny place, easy to walk by and miss. Each order comes with 15 luscious dumplings. The somewhat translucent, elastic wrappers were not too thick or too thin, yielding perfect mouthfuls with distinctly flavored fillings. There were both traditional dumpling flavors, such as pork/cabbage, pork/leek, and some unusual filling combinations for $7-10.  The pork/mushroom and shrimp/leek/egg mushrooms are probably equally good boiled or fried into pot-stickers (add $1.50).  In addition, we quite enjoyed the beef/curry/onion dumplings, which the very nice waiter recommended to be fried. There were vinegar, chili oil and soy sauce on the tables, so you did not have to ask for them. We also had a delicious jellyfish and cucumber salad, dressed with vinegar and probably sesame oil.  Although the waiter tried to tell us we were ordering too much for 2 people, we ate all but about 6 of the 45 dumplings.   I will add that the leftover steamed dumplings were perfectly delicious straight out of my hotel refrigerator the next morning for breakfast!"

Earlier in the afternoon while walking about I scouted out some potential choices, and this place caught my attention with their dumpling offerings. (I had not pre-researched anywhere beforehand...this was just walk-around research.) As dinnertime approached, I returned here and found the place crowded, but since I was solo this trip I just decided to order my meal to-go and enjoy it at my nearby hotel.I chose an order of Pork & Shrimp with Coriander dumplings, and an order of Beef & Onion dumplings. Each order comes 15 per order, for $7.99 each order. The dumplings are prepared fresh to order; I returned 15 minutes after placing my order and it was ready to go. Both varieties I chose definitely lived up to expectations; they were fresh and tasty on their own, and the 2 dipping sauces (soy-based, and hot-chili based) were complementary as well.I would definitely return again on my next trip."

I was expecting the dumplings to be deep fried (and in fact was feeling guilty for not having worked out that day) but was pleasantly surprised to see that they were only lightly pan fried on one side, so the frying wasn't too overpowering. The dumplings were simple yet very delicious. One plate filled me (I was dining alone) but I could easily see how you could order a couple of plates and share.

The location very was difficult to find as their sign is above a different building. The restaurant is really located under the sign of a smiling dumpling, not under the sign that says Mai Xiang Yuan. I like trying little places like this, and because of the reviews I had high hopes, but these dumplings sucked. Also the women making the dumplings weren't wearing any gloves. I know this is fairly common at small places like this, but it is always a speck unnerving when you see a cook who doesn't bother with basic sanitation standards. I ordered the beef and coriander and the pork with shrimp. The beef dumplings were burnt so I started out with the pork. They were very bland and fairly greasy. The chili oil didn't have any heat to it which was another letdown. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the portions are big, but that doesn't really matter if the food sucks. Wouldn't recommend, wouldn't go here again, and I regret having put as much effort as I did into finding this place."

Food: I was getting more and more ravenous during the excruciating wait, but I could tell at once that the dumplings were indeed freshly made and wrapped by the women in the window at the back because my fried dumpling order had long tubular dumplings while the boiled dumplings were more of the half moon shape. The fried dumplings, pork/shrimp/mushroom filling, were good although not superlative, mostly because of the ground pork which seemed of relatively poor quality and the overly large, crunchy but pretty tasteless pieces of shrimp. The fried outside, which seemed to have been coated with a little cornstarch and then fried, was crusty and good but nothing to write home about. However, the boiled pork/preserved vegetable/fresh oyster dumpling (which was the most expensive dumpling on the menu at around $10) was out of this world! The oyster flavor was fresh, flavorful, and not overpowering, and the salted vegetable gave it even more of an umami boost. The spicy sauce and the vinegar were also delightful. Overall: Five stars for the oyster dumplings, but one star off for the overall so-so service and other issues, including the fact that they were out of the hand-pulled noodles."

/user_details?userid=1tDMGGN2dSONSeqq05P3PA,Chris M.,"Ballarat, Australia",5 star rating,"I've had my fair share of dumplings and these are right up there with the best I've had. We went during the lunch rush and weren't given the option to sit, so we got take away.  I had the pork, coriander and shrimp while my wife had the shrimp, leek and egg. Both were succulent and tasted fresh, reasonably priced too. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."
/user_details?userid=fXHkYJUuctgiSUE81Eng-A,Angie S.,"Boca Raton, FL",1 star rating,"I was gravely disappointed with not only the service, but the quality of the dumplings we ordered.  We waited about 40 minutes after we ordered our food for one of our orders of the dumplings to be brought to our table.  We had no plates or spoons other than the plate that the dumplings came in.  Our other order came after my daughter finished her order.  Then I noticed that the dumplings were not the ones I ordered!  The server quickly took the dumplings away after I had one out of the steamer and served them to the people at another table.  He then told me to wait a little bit for the correct order to come.   We waited another 20 minutes before my order came.  I ordered shrimp, leek, and egg dumplings.  I could only taste the ""bad"" scrambled eggs inside the wrappings.  I think that I had a total of 1/2 of a shrimp chopped up and spread across the 15 small dumplings in my order.  The dumplings were served directly on the bamboo steamers and I was not given a plate or utensils.  I found it very difficult to have my meal.  I ended up stuffing the bad and tasteless dumplings down my throat and finished the meal quickly so that I could leave.  The total time spent at the restaurant was about 2 hours.  It was definitely not worth our time and I will not rely on Yelp reviews in the future.  This is the fourth bad restaurant that Yelp reviews have guided me to."

/user_details?userid=kt4Xh9ot13uAg5sG0ueYLg,Mike C.,"Morristown, NJ",5 star rating,"For what it is, a dumpling store, this place cranks out really amazing dumplings.  Best I've had pretty much.  Your choice if you get them boiled or fried but my preference is for boiled.  They have an assortment of side salads that are worth investigating too.  My favorite is the cucumber salad.  Okay the decor is somewhat lacking and on a cold day you might not want to sit too close to the front door.  But if you're in pursuit of some really excellent dumplings this is the place."

/user_details?userid=W_EQFi2fXpBtuRm510cCpA,Lauretta L.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Very cheap dumplings that have more quality than their price gives away. Each of my pork and shrimp dumplings had a whole baby shrimp inside and were very juicy :). I saved half for dinner and was very satisfied. I wouldn't say these are the best dumplings I've had, but they are great given the price."
/user_details?userid=mWqgE5aqCWCkG_gNvGmzNQ,Ivy D.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly I came to Montreal hoping to get away from all the Asian cuisine offered in Toronto, but as I was walking to my hotel through Chinatown on an empty stomach I got desperate and stumbled into this dumpling place, with a cute dumpling sign above the door. Now, I have nothing against Asian cuisine, it's just that I have dumplings all the time and can have it whenever I want. Despite all this prejudice, I have to say, these were some of the BEST dumplings I have had. It's a little bit ridiculous how much I enjoyed these dumplings when I tried so hard to avoid Chinese food in Montreal. I ordered the boiled pork and leek dumplings and the fried lamb and onion dumplings. The servings were definitely worth the price, came in a big plate of about 12-15 for less than $10. The boiled dumplings were absolutely perfect, while the fried ones could have been better, they were a little burnt and hard, which took away from the taste. Overall very good dumplings and came pretty quickly too. The staff spoke English, French and Mandarin fluently. I also really liked the cups, soy sauce plates and teapots they had."
/user_details?userid=MA0SBFvPLSQzFH5sC0zCTA,Donna P.,"El Granada, CA",5 star rating,"Love this restaurant. The dumplings are delicious and made fresh to order. Just with they had a variety plate, so we could try more flavors. Our favorite is the pork, coriander, and shrimp dumpling. You can get them fried or boiled. The boiled dumplings have the best flavor, because the frying oil can detract from the flavor of the dumplings."

The portions were ample but not over the top, and the dumplings were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would have liked a little more variety on the menu, but I can understand the need to keep things concise in a small establishment."
/user_details?userid=xs8IKROVq7PLDDRb7Udwfg,Allison D.,"Menlo Park, CA",4 star rating,"I had the pork, shrimp, leek and egg for lunch (steamed). 1 plate was plenty!  They were yummy. They were perfectly tender and delicious. I wish I could have tried another kind but the only option seems to be to order 15 at a time. Thx to yelpers for explaining how to use the little saucer and condiments on the table to mix a little dipping sauce. I had the cucumber salad which was ok - visually it was a little off-putting since it was the smaller Persian cucumbers, that were more crushed than chopped. It was tart and a little spicy. Prices were very reasonable (~$9 for dumplings and $1-2 for salads). The fried versions of dumplings looked pan-fried not deep fried. Cash only for less than $20. They were fairly busy for lunch on a tues. but no wait. Service was a little slow but there was only 1 woman doing everything - taking orders, delivering food and collecting cash. There were 3 ladies at the back, making dumplings by hand!"
