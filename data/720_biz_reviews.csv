/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to a networking event in Old Montreal in May where they were showcasing all the good stuff of that neighborhood, The Epik team was there and I had a taste of their succulent meatballs. The meatballs were so good that I made it a mission to visit their restaurant.Almost three months later (Yeah, I'm not very fast), as I was walking in Old Montreal, I came across their restaurant and decided to try it for lunch.The Epik restaurant is located in the boutique hotel of the same name and therefore decorated with refinement. I was seated on their beautiful intimate terrace.I ordered the Polpette (beef meatballs with tomato sauce and basil-whipped ricotta) accompanied by grilled market vegetables (10$) and their Caffe e Bomboloni (a donut stuffed with Nutella 4$), everything was excellent !! The meatballs were soft and well seasoned, the grilled vegetables were crispy and the dessert was not too sweet.The service was excellent, the team was just as friendly as during that networking event in May. I specified that I was in a hurry and the service was perfectly seamless.I recommend this place for anyone looking for originality in their lunch!"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"""You gotta hydrate to dominate!""A direct quote from our waiter when I asked him to splash my white wine while I was waiting on a glass of red. Super funny, in fact the waiter was quite pleasant and cool during our dinner.The Burrata starter was out of this world good. I have to confess I'm not a tomato fan, but this dish was loaded with super fresh and tasty off the vine examples. The heirloom was lightly smoked and incredible, the cheese was delicious and had a sweet breadcrumb topping. Fantastic!I ordered the veal chop (medium rare) which was served with some great looking grilled veggies. Unfortunately the chop was cooked through, grey and tasteless so I sent it back to the kitchen without trying the sides. Bummer, I ordered the first and only chop of the evening, so they couldn't refire one for me. The manager stopped by to apologize and we swapped the chop out for an Osso Bucco. That dish was good, very tasty and the side of polenta was cheesy and delicious. Given the major kitchen mistake and the fact my wife waited to eat while my second dish was being prepared I would have expected a comped dessert or glass of wine, neither of which was offered so minus 1 star. This was our second visit and I think we'll go back?  Honestly there are so many excellent restaurants in this area an experience like this makes me think twice about returning. Too bad, this place has a lot going for it."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It was a beautiful sunny day and we wanted to have dinner on a terrace. I saw a recommendation on his place, went to check the menu online and thought it'd be a great idea!The terrace is very cute. It is situated behind their boutique hotel. Medium intimate compared to some other terraces in the neighborhood. The staff is very courteous, helpful, attentive and funny. We took some cocktails which were good. The food menu is nice, you have a table d'hotes option as well which we went with.The starters were good, unfortunately the red snapper was dry & over-cooked. And since we both took the same main, I cannot confirm that other dishes were good or not. (The one good thing was that I was half full just with the starter so it didn't bother me as much) I would definitely come back here for drinks and snacks but I'm not too sure about dinner. As the service & everything else was awesome, it made it a very pleasant visit."

/user_details?userid=GVzJrDgMTJ5TXwyGqa5l9w,Scott R.,"Clovis, CA",5 star rating,"We'd traveled all day, getting in late ... wandering around old Montreal. We felt like Italian and found Epik. David welcomed us with ""welcome back"" and the word ""you're home"" as he sat us on their beautiful heated patio. Frank our server, continued the same hospitality and warmth. The food (chicken and lasagna) were exceptional - a great wine and one of the best margaritas ever made it a perfect first night in Canada. One of the friendliest restaurants- combined with excellent food. Ever."
/user_details?userid=orIXHRYTdCEH_4RkDjuGZw,Jon S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Great food, great wine and excellent service. We had a great evening sitting outside on their lovely patio. The waiter was amazingly smart and well-informed about wine, and guided us well to a terrific bottle that complimented our food so well. We did not feel rushed despite the fact that the restaurant was busy. I plan to go back the next time I am in the city."
/user_details?userid=pOoSYJzO4P7COoIxUaW3nw,Alessandra F.,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",5 star rating,Italian food tonight. The restaurant is nice and with a special atmosphere. Make a reservation because it is not big. Food was great: insalat di barbabietola with goat cheese light and tasty; seabass with orzo and veggie and my boyfriend veal involtini: all a 10/10. And to finish tiramisi: nice creamy super ...Aperitivo at the level of the dinner as well as the red wine Valpolicella. Service at the top. A great place to eat while in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=6UJPdr0y8UDtylRHpSKAqw,Sneha S.,"Los Gatos, CA",5 star rating,Came here for my birthday dinner! Loved this restaurant. They have very modern interiors. The bread was decent and my husband loved the wine selection. We ordered the burrata to start with and it was heavenly! I still think about that burrata. Definitely worth the $26! The mains were nice and as expected for a good Italian restaurant. The dessert was amaaazing! One of the best tiramasu's we have ever had.
/user_details?userid=kGHGV7s6-DXJMQJ9-E2eoQ,Elena M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"What a hidden Gem! My husband and I walked past this restaurant a few times on our visit and finally decided to give it a try on our last night. Impressive. The pasta fresco was absolutely delicious and the butternut squash gnocchi was gorgeous. The place was busy but not too loud and had a great vibe to it. Even though it was busy and we didn't have a reservation, the host accommodated us very quickly. Cozy space and super friendly. Classy service and great wine too. Next time we visit Montreal we will definitely come back here. Totally recommend."

/user_details?userid=U9tqs6cKzavKkokehZnywg,M. V.,"Watertown, MA",5 star rating,"Really enjoyed my evening at Restaurant Epik. The food was delicious- I ordered the pasta e fagioli and the lasagna. Both were seasoned perfectly, requiring nothing additional. The service was excellent. Charles was a friendly and accommodating bartender. Cocktails were delicious.

/user_details?userid=vcYkYL7QG_kpUmUAfisfpA,J P.,"Playa del Rey, Playa del Rey, CA",4 star rating,"Came here for a nice dinner and wasn't disappointed. The food was good and so was the atmosphere sitting outside. We had to wait a while for our food, but the waiter was so friendly that it made up for it.  The flavor in the pollo al forno was subtle and the fried calamari could have been more tender but all in all this was a really nice place to eat."
/user_details?userid=BjuxKWrStJnnX4jhQzqXSw,Tiffany V.,"Yukon, OK",5 star rating,"Ate here our first night in Montreal and had some of the best food ever! Everything from the ""tasting"" board to the dessert was fresh and delicious. The waiters were extremely helpful and nice. I will be here again next time we visit."
/user_details?userid=WgdozIRyj5St8VQ9it-j5A,Stuart A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Cocktails and ambiance were pretty nice. Definitely a nice place environment. The food was not great though. Asked what the best things on the menu were and ordered Caprese Salad, Gnocchi and Veal. Gnocchi was far from good. Chewy. The veal was dry. So overall. Not the best. Caprese salad was what you would expect. I am surprised by all the high reviews. Something doesn't add up."
/user_details?userid=zsOiUTKn5GBOoCyYuOc-XQ,Patrick M.,"Roswell, GA",2 star rating,"Very disappointed. Once we said we we're having martinis and appetisers, we got ignored and then relegated to a junior waitperson. The Caesar salad was great, the calamari pretty mediocre. Main issue was the service: petty."

/user_details?userid=XEaeeCoQgh3p7eqfbIUPzA,Lori L.,"West Warwick, RI",5 star rating,"Had a lovely dinner here tonight! Started with the cheese plate which was lovely in its presentation and more then adequate for two people. The entrees that followed, the bolognese with gnocchi and the sirloin steak were well prepared. All of this was surrounded by the sweet melodies of the guitarist featured in the front dining room, lending a relaxed sophisticated atmosphere to our dining experience."

Justin the bartender Came out to our table because I was raving about the old fashion that he made. Honestly probably one of the best meals we have ever had. And the BEST Old Fashion!!! The environment was fabulous the service was great. Frank was our waiter. We enjoyed the entire experience. Do not walk to this restaurant, Run!!"

/user_details?userid=Mhj_xPWcuwpPdtRib1aUDw,C Z.,"The Woodlands, TX",5 star rating,We happened upon this place while visiting Old Montreal. Walked in there for dinner with hubby and my kids (7 & 9) while touring around. AMAZING from start to finish! My youngest loved the quail egg appetizers and dumplings. Sushi was creative and the best tasting we've had in years. Fresh and well presented. We'll DEFINITELY be coming back when we visit again!!
/user_details?userid=sU1cdr_sf2E2g4NG3lKsHA,Lulu P.,"Seattle, WA",1 star rating,"Nasty ""manager"" (greeter) who lied about seating being available on the terrace despite a reservation and on-time arrival. This manager insisted that it was ""first come first serve"" on the terrace. OK...we accept that. But since we thought he was lying about the availability out there, we asked to see the terrace only to see a number of empty tables. He actually said to us at that point, ""OK, if you want that table you can have it, but I can't guarantee the food"". What? Were you going to spit in it? We will never return to this place and this is not the way to make people want to come here. There was absolutely no reason for this treatment as we came on time and simply asked to eat outdoor. Shame on these folks!! And no, I'll never take this manager up on an offer to dine there as I'd never trust them. He has admitted not telling the truth about their ""policy"" and then again there is no truth to the comment about swearing and violent language. I can't seriously believe that such a reply would be written."

The atmosphere like a hip bar/lounge and the food like a 5 star restaurant. The mojitos were also delicious. I honestly didn't want to leave this place. Waiters speak perfect English and are super nice and helpful as well. Should i return to Montreal one day, this restaurant is on my list of things to visit."

/user_details?userid=-atxx_G9W1sXZ1RYDqUSVg,Dave L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Nice terrace seating in the back of the hotel.  We all had pasta dishes, which were excellent, as were the salad starters. Service was very friendly.  When we left, we saw that the terrace platform was actually part of a parking lot but we couldn't tell when we were seated because of the way the fence was constructed.  Clever use of space!"
/user_details?userid=X47XO-MBpihwIJaOatS4JA,Joshua H.,"Arlington, MA",5 star rating,"What a great way to end our visit to Montreal!  We went looking for a great last dinner and had a challenging time finding a place (many were closed during the holidays) until we lucked upon Restaurant Epik.  Everything was outstanding - the greeting from David, the service from Alex, the libations from Justin the mixing man.  And the food, oh the food.  Tough to pick a favorite.  It was all so delicious.  Best of all, we created a great family memory.  Thanks for capping off a great trip."
/user_details?userid=uleZU3yWp5Kfe6DUxK8MOg,Kimberly W.,"Issaquah, WA",5 star rating,We had a fabulous time in the Epik bar this evening - our bartender Justin was great! Had a delicious couple of glasses of wine - and met some great people from Toronto - we were just going to have one glass of wine but the atmosphere was like a local bar - you felt welcome from the moment you sat down! A friendly bartender can make all the difference!

I had the Black-inked linguine, it was good but way too sweet. In conclusion, I had a great time and will definitely be coming back."

/user_details?userid=iGY19evKMQV64G05iRD6xg,Choua V.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,Such a cute find with great hospitality. The food was amazing and the wine was great. We had the special pumpkin gnocchi with lasagna and dessert.  The service was also really amazing they filled our water and wine and checked up on us frequently enough so that we didn't feel like we were abandoned. The music was also live but not overly  loud so that you couldn't have a conversation.  If you are in the old Montreal area I highly recommend you stopping here for an amazing dinner.
/user_details?userid=VxxpuxsCdWu3UXiTrVbtIA,Barry C.,"Grantham, NH",5 star rating,Best pasta I have ever had...epic! The pasta was cooked just right and the meat sauce was very flavorful! Pleasant atmosphere though would have preferred Sinatra over beat music. Will go back there again.
/user_details?userid=eMj1xfJQ3u7sz0hpZGSkUQ,P H.,"Newton Centre, MA",4 star rating,The food was excellent. We had the risotto fruti di mare and the linguini fruti di mare. Both were very good almost perfect except the mussels were just s bit overdone. Service was amazing.

/user_details?userid=Y1yhWP_9rJq82X9D-QtSGg,Jason R.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,Their Frutti di Mare is really good + prosciutto y formaggio too! We thought it looked like a good restaurant so we went to it to eat dinner on our last night of our visit from Austin TX to Montreal. We ate dinner there & it was really good 5 Days after we saw it.  We hope you have a good dinner at restaurant Epik. (Review by Luke age 7)
/user_details?userid=qj5TvfJI_9iP8aGRiER2DA,Shannon K.,"North Hero, VT",2 star rating,"We took a trip to Montreal to celebrate my husbands 40th. We found this restaurant on yelp and thought we would give it a try. The service was great, the food mediocre. My husband had the mushroom ravioli and there was no flavor to his dish. It was extremely bland. I had the shrimp and risotto and felt that the arugula was the best part, so disappointing. The bread and wine were good, but we wish we had chosen a different restaurant."
/user_details?userid=NEQQ15IEyibmetPXvWbBjQ,William W.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Stellar meal with a fantastic ambiance, superb service, and a truly spectacular experience. I had seared veal and pasta and my spouse a lovely mushroom risotto. It is a small, quaint, and very personalized dining experience. David was quite a character but was just the right balance of personality and solid server. A truly fabulous meal we will likely remember for years to come."

/user_details?userid=YWHF5RWUoazcBkNFJMRcPQ,Anjali G.,"Evanston, IL",5 star rating,This was the best Italian meal I've had in a very long time! We had red pepper bisque soup and the butternut squash gnocchi which were both simply perfect. Beignets were also delicious!!! Our server was also very good. This place is part of a hotel so you could easily miss it when walking by. But I highly recommend it!
/user_details?userid=_hSfCcXanY2NlYI38McXHQ,Steve D.,"Newburgh, NY",4 star rating,Attentiveness of overall staff was excellent. Food was ridiculously amazing! Risotto Funghini fabulously paired with a 2010 Antinori Tignanello! I'd come back again in a minute!!

Everything was sooo good, and we loved watching the chef make everything fresh. Service was prompt and polite (also spoke perfect English, which we appreciated as travelers from the US), and prices were fair considering these were generous portions for tapas style. Also, the martini was perfect. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=DBe74Cp86cVHBzADisHZQA,C R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Started with the calamari app. It was decent. Nothing special. A bit breadie for my tastes. The seafood risotto was also nothing to write home about. I was expecting large scallops for that prize but I was sadly mistaken...
/user_details?userid=onp3qoo5n-MduFrPSXR5BQ,Rachael S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",5 star rating,"It must have been written in the stars that we (4 foodie, boozy Bostonians) would find this place. The food was amazing, the service impeccable!! It didn't hurt that the entire staff was gorgeous. Silvio, the owner, took SUCH good care of us. We've never experienced such warmth, generosity, and sincere care. Our late lunch experience was so fabulous that we had to repeat it. The food far exceeded our expectations - wowed us, in fact- and the wine selections were lovely. We will be coming back again on our next visit to Montreal. I can only imagine that the hotel services are just as fabulous."
