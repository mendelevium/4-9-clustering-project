/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,The real deal when it comes to a good pork sandwich. I can't recommend this place enough. Their sandwiches are so good and so filling. The flavours are so well arranged and it all comes together so well. I've had the regular and the fried chicken sandwiches but truly you can't go wrong with anything you pick here. The chicken is crispy and not too greasy. The pork is fatty and juicy and mixed with the bell peppers you will be in food heaven. The portions are also big so don't worry about being hungry after. The sandwiches come with fries and those are good too but you're really there for the sandwich honestly.

I tried the regular pancetta sandwich with salad. I pimped up my veggie content with the rapini. I liked my sandwich and loved the rapini. My dad would have loved this place, loved his pancetta. Glad I came by."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Porchetta is all about that tasty roasted pork belly. Tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Been here a few times already and I strongly recommend it if you're in the area if you're looking for a great sandwich. Priced at about $6-8, it's a sweet deal!Had the classico a few times and the franchese a few times as well and I'm definitely a huge fan of the classico. The quality of the sandwich is at times what can change, especially if the porchetta isn't fresh or the person preparing it puts too much dijon or not enough meat.Out of the 4 sandwiches I ate, 2 were decent, 1 was really good and one was the best porchetta sandwich I ever had! So your mileage may vary depending on who preps the sandwich and when you're visiting.The location is small with limited seating but being somewhere like Little Italy where you can walk around and enjoy the sites, you can easily grab a sandwich, eat it on the job before you head someone else for an Italian dessert or espresso.I strongly recommend this place."

The pork is tender and flavorful, the salsa verde is perfect addition, and the bread is soft and a great addition to the meat. In addition the gentleman behind the counter was so helpful. He offered us recommendations in the area for pastries, cheese, and wine. It's a small shop but worth the stop by."

The Bun was cold, the meat was not hot nor juicy, there was barely any carmelized onions. Service was just average as well.Won't be going back"
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's weird how i will delay trying something that's right under my nose for so long.Not this time, i finally grabbed a porchetta sandwich and half-chicken for work.This is about as upscale as a take-out counter can be, beautiful floor, decor and presentation.There are 3 types of porchetta ($8), i tried the one with marinated onions and french mustard.The sandwich is not gigantic but it is loaded with meat, a few items like tomato and raw onions would have helped for me. The closest thing i can compare it to is the Portuguese bifana sandwich but the quality and the cut of meat is much superior. I brought the chicken for guys at work but tasted some of it and it is exquisite rotisserie style with the most heavenly potatoes ($12 and they threw in a bread when i asked). The only thing missing is some type of hot sauce for the chicken, but I always have my own on standby.There are more locations now and there's also Porco in NDG, so maybe our fair city is falling in love with another delicacy."

/user_details?userid=tuTOS6G6d3VjjVjnnMkuug,Niki S.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2 star rating,Went to their location in st Leonard and was very disappointed.  Ambiance was cold. Sandwich was empty all we tasted was bread. Fries were reheated soggy mess. Benches were very uncomfortable. The little porchetta we had did taste good on its own.
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Went to Porchetta on a Saturday aftenoon to try out their famous porchetta sandwich which I had heard so much about and let me tell you it defintaely lived up to expectations! Their porchetta sandwich was delicious and would recommend to head out to one of their locations to try it.  The st-laurent location is small but perfect for grabbing a bite to eat. The seating is counter style. Their classic porchetta sandwich comes with chuck hughes giardinera and each bite is packed with amazing flavors. What makes this sandwich also stand out is the salsa verde which is an herb sauce composed of a mixture of basil and mint. Will defintaely be back!
/user_details?userid=VMfwMYh8iJapW807Pu1Diw,Jenviev A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",2 star rating,"As a big porchetta fan, this place did not meet my expectations.First off, the porchetta panino consisted of a lot of mayo and meat on a bun. No lettuce, no tomato, no cheese, nada. After roaming around Italy and trying a variety of sandwiches topped with fresh ingredients and condiments, this was very underwhelming. Not to mention, the guy making them seemed to have no interest whatsoever in making and serving paninis. Needless to say, the lack of love was apparent. The meat itself was dry, while the sandwich extremely oily. We also tried the mortadella, which  unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed. After spending $25 on 2 sandwiches and potatoes, we felt a little disappointed all around."
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Just grabbed some meals to go with a few friends. Two of us got the porchetta plate and two had the sandwich. Consensus is that the sandwich plus a side is a better deal than the plate (which comes with meat and a side). The porchetta is flavourful; definitely the highlight (which explains the name of the restaurant). The side of potatoes was a bit disappointing; taste-wise nice but the texture felt like they were under the heat lamp too long. The zappole were a nice, zesty end to the meal.Overall, a tad oily and on the pricier side for me, but worth a visit if you're craving tasty pork(A friendly observation would be to revisit the takeaway packaging. The containers are huge for the portion size.)"

The pork was juicy, fatty and crispy as I like it. Got the fried chicken with a hint of honey which made my meal. Considering I'm Italian, This is the type of food and to the right accuracy of what I would eat at my nonna's place."
/user_details?userid=1Nkuhh-HOUB7XUfgImWxmw,Valentina D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best porchetta I've had in Montreal. Just the right amount of crunchy crust in the panini.
/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's an Italian sandwich with porcetta. It's amazing. There's not much more to say. If you'v been a lot, you get hooked to this greasy porchetta sandwich. It's salty, greasy and taste amazing.  As a side I take the Aranchini (The deep fried Risotto with meat inside) which is very crispy, creamy deliciousness It's about 12$-14$ - totally worth it"
/user_details?userid=Hffqre-X6CVVq48t_fWtmA,Camille R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was good, but not as good as it could have been. Had the classico porchetta sandwich, which was good but far from mind-blowing. Would have been nice to have some toppings on there, like cheese or lettuce or tomato. It feels more like a take-out place; chairs are small and high."
/user_details?userid=UZMXgZhGtHOAuwX1ubSxYA,Natasha P.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,Delicious!! You can't go wrong with a Classica! It's sooo juicy and flavorful. Even the bread was amazing. We also had a side of rapini and Brussel sprouts. Both of them were cooked perfectly and still had crunch :) I'm sure everything is great on the menu!
/user_details?userid=a_CLAoxJBsDeq5zHPU09sA,Alexandre S.,"Montreal, Brazil",5 star rating,Absolutely delicious well-done porchetta. A must-try. (I have not tried the sandwich)I don't live near and I won't even mind traveling back just to get some more! And try some zepolla for dessert! OMG delicious as well.

/user_details?userid=F6ch3t28IrA2MYJW2IZ_XQ,Patrick B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Phenomenal little place, rustic at home feel to it as well. Their home made add-ons as well as their homemade mortadella is another reason to go there all together. Have yourself a porchetta sandwich on those chilly days, it'll warm you right up and fill you up nonetheless."
/user_details?userid=K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,Claudia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I can't write too long of a review for this place because my experience was fast. I was in little Italy one night, hanging at a friend's house when I got a crazy hunger attack. I believe it was almost 11:00pm and thankfully La Porchetta was still open. I order the pork sandwich which was really good. The meat was juicy, tender, succulent and full of flavour. They use good quality fresh panini bread. The only thing negative I could think of was that it was a tad too oily. Other than that the sandwich was great and it settled my late night hunger."
/user_details?userid=HMQYQHcBiLM8JM36q3q5QQ,Cassandra S.,"Stamford, CT",3 star rating,"This was ok. We got the broccoli rabe side and arancini and they were pretty good.  As someone from a very big Italian family, we were excited to have lunch in Little Italy on our way home from the city, but this wasn't necessarily the 'mom and pop' type of Italian place we were looking for, but it was one of the few places open so we gave it a whirl.  The food was pretty similar to what we're used to in Italian restaurants at home, it was all good but nothing necessarily remarkable.  Definitely stop in for lunch if you're in the area"

/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For those not in the know, Porchetta, is a savoury, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast of Italian culinary tradition. The body of the pig is gutted, deboned, arranged carefully with layers of stuffing, meat, fat, and skin, then rolled, spitted, and roasted, traditionally over wood. Porchetta is usually heavily salted in addition to being stuffed with garlic, rosemary, fennel, or other herbs, often wild. Now that you know what it is, you have to taste it to believe it.Served as a sandwich, the porchetta was moist and seasoned perfectly and best of all it was delicious. Numerous sides are also available to perfectly complement your dining experience. We sampled many of the sides and decided our favorites were the rapini with breadcrumbs, the roasted potatoes  and the arancini (fried stuffed rice balls, coated with breadcrumbs). The food was excellent and brought back fond memories of Italy. We were so full after our meal we could not even think of trying the zeppole for dessert. But that just gives us a reason to go back for another visit.For those wanting the entire Italian dining experience there are imported sodas available. Should you want to take you porchetta home you can buy it by the pound. Also you can also buy the pre-bottled tomato sauce, great for cooking at home.We really enjoyed meeting the team at Porchetta and loved the food. It really brought back memories of our travels to Italy. We highly recommend on your next visit to Little Italy in Montreal you stop by and try a sandwich."
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Would of given 5 stars but my experiences were mixed. First time I found the porchetta to be delicious. The hunk of meat they cut off of just looks spectacular. Fat is rendered down beautifully. Second time I went though was about 20 minutes before closing time and the pork was alot dryer and not as great. Im hoping it was just because it was the end of the night but should of still been delicious. I do wish they included a bit more crispy skin in the sandwich though.
