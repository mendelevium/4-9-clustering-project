Their salmon poke bowl is way too awesome.I came here a few times a week only for their salmon poke bowl. And this time I brought three friends with me and we all ordered the same dish.Not only is their salmon always fresh, it is always  a very generous portion. The avocado that is used in the dish (and every other dish) is always at the perfect ripeness. The sauce used in the poke bowl (apart from spicy mayo) is different from other restaurants', which is why I love it so much; it's a sweet and savory sauce made from sautéed mushrooms and aromatics. The taste, texture, and presentation of the poke bowl are outstanding. Even their price is unbeatable, at $12.45 for a very fair portion. I highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Not bad! The place is owned by a Chinese couple. They have a straightforward menu, nothing unique. The flavors and quality is similar to what you might find at e.g. Sushi Shop. The dining room is small and clean. I'm guessing most people buy to go, because there's no table service. So if you're eating there, they will hand you plates and ustensils over the counter. The soya sauce bottles are stored in the drinks counter - you grab them as needed. We ordered a 40 pieces plater to eat right away and a 24 pieces plater to go. They prepared the larger plater first, and given the waiting time, I assume that they made the sushi fresh. There was actually only 36 pieces, but the plater also included four little cups of pickled ginger and wasabi... So I guess it add up to ""40 pieces""? Or maybe they misunderstood my order and gave me the 36 pieces plater? Who knows. They didn't have any tempura shrimps, so we let the chef complete the combo plate as he wished. It included salmon, tuna, avocado, cucumber and shrimp rolls. Everything was very basic but nice. Not too expensive!"

They gave me mostly sushi with cucumber in it so it's basically cucumber and rice wrapped in sea weed and then there was avocado and cream cheese. Rather simple ones. I also got salmon dragon rolls which would have been great if the rice wasn't so bad. The rice was dry and felt uncooked. It's a mom and pop shop so I'm going to give them another chance soon."

Very nice miso soup as well.Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area and have a sushi craving to attend to."
/user_details?userid=PUdWx35NpHCZ4Zssto4hxQ,Cheryl P.,"Riverside, CA",2 star rating,We ordered according to the lunch menu but received only one piece of nigiri instead of two. Miso soup was way too fishy for our tastes. We got the impression that the sushi rolls were not made with fresh fish. It was a real disappointment!
