/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I only just recently tried Frite Alors, which is odd considering how much I love poutine to begin with ! I stopped in for a smoked meat poutine and it was okay. Definitely wouldnt be my first choice for poutine in the city for a few reasons but I wouldn't say it was terrible either. The fries seemed like they came from frozen (They didnt taste bad but they definitely dont measure up to those that have handcut or fresh house made fries), the gravy seemed to have good flavour  but it was hard to tell because it was lacking alot in the way of quantity. They barely put any gravy on there and certainly not enough to heat up the cheese curds. While they were wise to use cheese curds , they also were not very generous with the amount of those either.  The smoked meat portion on top was a good amount and it was tasty and well cooked.  That being said, this was an average poutine in a casual atmosphere at an average price and while it would not be my go to spot, it isn't so bad that I wouldn't be willing to give it another shot, as perhaps I came on an off night or was just unlucky this time around."

This one is clean, friendly staff, usually empty. Great for fast bite. I enjoy their meat poutines and burgers. It's not the most mind blowing poutine but it gets the job done. They have a pretty good beer selection though and 3, count three, different brands of root beer! Not sure why that is but it's fun."

/user_details?userid=5i8f_qKmYjBuRODEa_XQMw,Carolyn T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for a late dinner yesterday. Ordered the Burger Week special ""Le Huppé,"" which consists of a duck confit and ground chicken patty, arugula, Saint-Guillaume aged cheddar, red cabbage slaw, cranberries, pepitas, and dijonnaise sauce on a soft ciabatta bun. The burger came with fries and sauce for $12.50.As a chicken burger, it was pretty good. The savoury meat meshed well with the peppery greens, crunchy cabbage, sweet cranberries, nutty pepitas, and creamy sauce. However, I didn't taste anything that resembled duck confit =/ The fries were crispy and well-seasoned, but I didn't really like that they were short, stubby, and arrived in clumps (like they were stuck together in the fryer.) Service was meh... The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but they forgot my sauce and nobody checked on us during the meal. In fact, because we wanted to sit outside on the terrasse, we ordered and paid for our meals with the hostess and the first and last time we saw our server was when she brought us our food.Overall it's an average burger and fries joint."
/user_details?userid=LUi6EpD1X-sCdN5nvmZX8g,Pee J.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"02/12/2016After travelling 5-6 hours from Toronto to visit Montreal for the first time with my boyfriend this was our first food stop. The last thing we ate that day was Tim Hortons at around 8AM, right around the time we boarded the Megabus from the bus terminal back in Toronto. Ambience: When we arrived in Montreal, the weather was freezing and it began to snow.  We just stopped into the first restaurant we saw, which happened to be a few blocks away from our AirBnB. It was warm inside and not too busy.Service: We were instantly greeted with French greetings. We were able to seat ourselves and we looked through the menus. After 5 minutes of being near a closed windows we were still cold and asked if we could move seats and had no objections from our waitress.Food: I ordered a small classic poutine called La Vladimir with a small burger ($12.65), while my boyfriend ordered a vegetarian burger with a side of fries and the Rémoulade sauce ($11.85). The wait for food wasn't too long. The burger was pretty good! The gravy for the poutine was savoury and the cheese curds were squeaky and great. I had a bite of the veggie burger and it was really good and my boyfriend's fries were also good with the sauce he got it with.Price: With tip, the meal came up to around $30."

/user_details?userid=nuTKImmfxUftrQFrePNDPw,Wayne C.,"Glendora, CA",4 star rating,Good burgers and fries. The blue cheese burger is excellent. The buns are great as well. The outdoor/street side seating was good for summertime dinners. The service was good. I was less impressed with the sauces. However the fries were so good that sauces were unnecessary.
