/user_details?userid=STs1lUUVhQ3wlz9jFKnNiA,Alexander P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"One of my favorite places in Montreal, hands down. The food is delicious, expertly yet subtly prepared, and the definition of ""comfort food"". I live in NYC, but my wife is from Montreal and this is a must-visit spot for us every time we visit. The atmosphere hasn't changed in years, if not decades, and I hope it stays the same forever. The nostalgia runs deep here. There is no ""concept"" here and that is refreshing. It's just good, delicious food served by nice, wholesome people. The onion soup is spot-on and as good as it gets. The salad is exceptionally simple and fresh; I don't know what the garlic dressing is made out of, but it's completely addictive. The last time I was there, my friend's 8-year old son was even asking for third and fourth servings (no joke). The escargot is elegant and will warm your stomach. And then of course there are the crepes. I am partial to the one filled with champignon, bechemel, and cheese; drizzle it with a little Canadian maple syrup and you have basically just lived your best day. Get over to Ty-Breiz and get down to enjoying simple pleasures in life."

/user_details?userid=ytqNa6fouGOlvmvptWxZHg,Simona D.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to this place so many times over the past 8 years and still to this day it is amazing. Every time I go to this restaurant I always without a doubt order there onion soup (what they are famous for) and a there salad which is dressed with an garlic dressing, and I must say that I never get fed up. You can also buy the dressing if you want to make the salad at home. And of course I end my meal with one of their delicious chocolate, banana and strawberry crepe. Would definitely recommend if your an onion/garlic lover!"
/user_details?userid=uABgKX42VTRqGDUhSC_3mg,Adam C.,"Columbus, OH",2 star rating,"I agree with the other reviews that something's definitely off about this place. While Creperie Bretonne does have a pleasant dining room overlooking the street, the food and service left much to be desired. I had a buckwheat crepe with ham and cheese. The dish was served with piping hot vegetable cream soup, which (judging from the temperature and texture) was microwaved. The crepe itself was quite strange; the batter for the crepe was sweet and thick - almost like an American pancake. The ham was salty and the cheese was piping hot and liquefied (likely microwaved as well). The crepe places in Montreal are pretty touristy, but I'd skip this one, which is just plain bad."

I live in the US now, but it remains a must-visit every time I'm in Montreal. The garlic salad dressing is fabulous, the French onion soup is to die for, and the crepes are perfect."

The space is quaint and intimate, the staff is friendly, and all of the good was fantastic. Pricing was reasonable, so that was also a plus. And if you don't speak french they can help you out with some English. Consider trying the crepes and the snails. You'll love them!"
/user_details?userid=6vW5llwSbYe91k8LEkizNw,Martin C.,"Lake Worth, FL",4 star rating,"Despite the negative reviews of one or two contributors, we gave this creperie a go and were pleasantly surprised.The waitress who served us was very attentive and we had a pleasant meal of escargot, savoury crepes and for my daughter, a very nice sweet crepe of Nutella and Banana.All in all a very satisfactory meal."
/user_details?userid=5rN5MkdpZFw6gUJtVOMXpQ,Landon T.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Crepes, crepes, and more crepes. My wife ordered the crepe with ham, cheese, and mushrooms. I ordered the crepe with sausage, cheese, and mushrooms. Both we delicious. I would have preferred the sausage in my crepe had been cut up and evenly spread throughout the crepe. We then ordered the nutella and banana crepe for dessert which was also delicious.We recommend this place for a fun dinner date or fun group dinner."
/user_details?userid=9RXqX0moulrqsZtmRyAmZQ,Jennifer W.,"Holualoa, HI",5 star rating,"We loved this place so much we bought a jar of their salad dressing to bring home!  Restaurant decor was a bit dated, but server was friendly and food was a amazing.  Crepes were huge and the onion soup au gratin might be the best we've ever had!"
/user_details?userid=ngvPVaGw2IZ-WjAMmfFegw,Melissa D.,"Dallas, TX",1 star rating,"Came here around 2 pm and there was only 2 tables occupied so that should of been the first sign. I eat a lot of Crepes and I have to say the texture on these crepes were odd, over cooked and almost to thick to be Considered a true crepe . I got the spinach, ham And Brie and it was so salty and the spinach inside was most definitely previously frozen  which made the whole dish watery. My husband got the smoked salmon ate 3 bites and was done. It just tasted bad and not fresh. I gave it one star for the good service and because the salad and soup starter where good !"
/user_details?userid=N-9zppB3Sj5wHDmfNDVJoA,Eva B.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"This creperie has been around for many years for good reason as the food is super tasty and the servers are friendly and competent. We ordered the French onion soup and crepes with gruyere and apples. The soup was really good I loved how they let it bubble over the edges and it gets crisp and brown. The crepes were crispy, cheesy and the apples added a bit of bite. All the food we had was delicious. The only thing I would change would be to give the old place a bit of a facelift."
/user_details?userid=4XajWDwM71EB-z0dpd0R2A,Chandra F.,"Mont-Laurier, Canada",1 star rating,"So disappointed.  The buckwheat crepes were dry, had little to no filling.  The waitress stuck her hand inside the jug of water to hold it while taking orders and continued pouring from the container at other tables.  Save your money"
/user_details?userid=ws8w3gzeKvdJ04vkKSiYvw,S H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been coming here for years and haven't gotten around to posting a review, but I feel I must as it's been an oversight. I have to give a special shout-out the owner and staff for being so kind and helpful to my grandfather for so many years. He loved their onion soup and crepes, and used to come down to meet me for brunch. The staff always went out of their way to help get his wheelchair in and out of the restaurant and to be extra attentive to him. He's been gone for over two years now, and I still continue to have brunch there with his wife regularly and we remember all the good times we had with him. The menu is simple and good - Bretonne-style crepes, soups, salad with garlic dressing. It doesn't change much, but that's okay, because the formula for this place is tried-and-true and the customers like it that way. I hope this place never tries to re-invent itself or become ""trendy"" since it would surely get ruined.One tip: Please offer real maple syrup standard, rather than only as an optional upgrade. In Quebec, it's just embarrassing for any place to serve the fake stuff."
/user_details?userid=S6mueskv7VrcoF5K8-vUXg,Pat C.,"Laval-des-rapides, Laval, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is terrible! Please do not eat here. The buckwheat crepe was absolutely dry, over cooked and even tasted old. The crepe stuffing was literally something I could have made at home and there was not much of it. The price definitely is way too high for what you get (15$)???  I can't even believe this place is still open. Really bad. Do not waste your time or money."
/user_details?userid=hCTRibdps0KBw2E581MW7A,Nikos L.,"Plymouth, MA",2 star rating,"I had high hopes for this crepperie, since it claimed to follow the traditional Bretton recipes.  While not horrible, I was not impressed.  Crepes were dry, cidre was weird, beer selection non existent, and the crepes were not true Sarrasin.  A buckwheat melange that ended up dry and unsavoury.  In a pinch I would go because it's a friendly place, otherwise from a gastronomic standpoint this joint is not so."
/user_details?userid=2bfpsTEAuAsY93ELDBVr_A,Orly R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is authentic & flavorful and the staff makes it an amazing experience. If you are looking for a delicious sweet or savory crepe, this is definitely the place to go! I have been going here for many years and the dishes are always consistent and have never changed! The three things I always order: Salad with the famous garlic dressing (to die for), french onion soup (amazing crispy cheese coating on top), and of course the famous crepes (strawberry and banana is my favorite)!"
/user_details?userid=WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ,Gillian T.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here for the first time in June 2012 with some French (from France) friends and, having first tasted a crêpe in Brittany, appreciated the availability of buckwheat flour (sarrasin) pancakes and cidre brut. I returned on Friday because my daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday in a crêperie. There are numerous places in Montreal that serve savoury pancakes, but few that have buckwheat flour, or even unsweetened wheat batter. There's nothing worse than ham and cheese wrapped up in a sweet crêpe.The decor is extremely twee but gives the place some atmosphere, I suppose. The menu gives you plenty of suggestions but you can compose your own crêpe. I like the option since I always go for the traditional ham, egg and cheese, but miss vegetables. This way I get to add asparagus and feel less guilty.We drank the traditional cider but, as mentioned by some French contributors, it was not served in the traditional Breton ceramic bowl, which is disappointing. Desserts were great. They even had a special birthday crêpe, served in a bowl with fruit and chantilly and a birthday sparkler.Service was ok but a bit slow. To be honest, they didn't really have enough staff. But they were friendly and efficient.All in all, it's not bad. A crêpe is hardly a gourmet experience, and while I've certainly had better (in France), this does the trick for when I'm craving that taste."
/user_details?userid=tTxCwqnI5XZLARookFxYsQ,G C.,"Newark, NJ",4 star rating,"Super, crispy Brittany-style crepes in Tyrolian surroundings.  The buckwheat crepes were as good as I recall from the legendary A La Crepe Bretonnes, no longer in existence. Tasty, crisp, and very large and filling. The mushroom and Swiss cheese was very good, as was the banana and Nutella. The waiter was excellent and friendly and attentive. The place is lovely, with Tyrolian wood interior. We will return, to get our bretonnique crepe fix again."
/user_details?userid=1tp9-3xPauVw9kEVt4vDlQ,Bree R.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"The waitress was very rude. I guess she didn't like the fact that I was speaking English? Whatever it was she had RBF. The crepes were extremely poor. Who puts a sweet Bechamel sauce on a savory crepe? After she forgot the ham on mine, she became super nice, then told me she tried to take off the entire crepe from the bill but they wouldn't let her. My girlfriend ordered the same and ate half because she was hungry. Why should we buy food just to be full? We were expecting to enjoy the crepes. Maybe we should've tried sweet crepes because the savory seemed too difficult for the chef. Don't go with high expectations."
/user_details?userid=b5k93J77aYBg-0DRPSgLyw,Joshua B.,"Brookline, MA",3 star rating,"Had lunch there a few days ago with a family of 4. The kids menu was great. I loved the garlicky salad dressing and the wait staff was friendly. The savory crepes aux sarrasin were ok but not great. We had eggs+cheese, mushrooms and cheese and provencal tomato crepes. I'd definitely eat there again but wouldn't go out of my way too far to do so."
/user_details?userid=segRkXhf1vSCnEi_aHnGdg,Lauren Ashley S.,"Orange, CA",3 star rating,"My family loves this place but I've had a couple of bad experiences. It's either really good or really bad. The garlic salad is amazing and their onion soup is out of this world. Their crepes can go both ways (and I only order nutella/chocolate banana so that says A LOT). Once went in and they were out of bananas, strawberries, and shrimp. So I ordered nutella/chocolate apple instead of my usual which was very disappointing. I opened up my heated apple and chocolate crepe and found a SAUSAGE link inside. Quite disgusting, really.My sister usually orders their shrimp plate, but since they were out - literally went next door for sushi as everything else she wanted was out of stock. Expect the worst or the best, it's really a toss up!"

/user_details?userid=2qcwr4VpML9W5Yi_fFYqPg,Ssss S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Today was the first time i went there. The food was special. The crust of the crepe was crunchy, the dressing of the salad was too thick. The service was really disappointing."
/user_details?userid=VvYbQfNtbNZFj13cs-gEfg,Liora I.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We stopped in here after a fall day in the park. Nothing could have hit the spot better.  The yam soup was great + the scallop, fennel, carrot crepe I had was good BUT the real winner was my date's choice: apple, housemade sausage and emmenthal cheese crepes all covered in syrup... I'm salivating even now just writing this."
/user_details?userid=uTBS8t6QE4bPehE5WVk6vA,Dave S.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"I came by just as they were starting to close. They were pretty nice to me and allowed me to come in and order crepes which is why I came here.I had a chicken crepe with sun dried tomato and goat cheese. I was very happy with this choice - it was larger than i expected, just the right size to satisfy my appetite. IT was cooked just right and very tasty. The price was reasonable.To finish I wanted a desert crepe but wanted to try something other than the usual nutella or simple sugar or lemon. The waitress suggested an almond paste / ice cream crepe. That sounded good and it was! It was really tasty and unique. I will look for this crepe again next time i go to any crepe place. I hadn't ever heard of one so this may be something only found at places like Ty-Breiz.So I would recommend this place although you should go there earlier than just before closing"
/user_details?userid=Lfe1Gm1sVejCDXoZIKXXoQ,Lydia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I have lunch here every time I'm in Montreal.  The onion soup is amazing, and now they even do a mini, which is more than enough for anyone.  I love the side salad, and the dressing--with garlic--that's served along with the crepes at lunch.  Favourite crepes--apples and ice creme, mushrooms and cheese, asparagus. I've always had a great experience (except for the time that I got a ticket on Mentana, that I never should have gotten.  I was totally legal)."
