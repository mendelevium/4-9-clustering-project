Their take-out menu is very diversified and they even have vegetarian options!! We tried two fried chicken sandwiches which were incredibly moist and savoury: the Moon Dog, which comes with chili jam, escabeche slaw, red sauce, pickles & house mayo and the Spicoli, served with sweet onion, house honey and their special sauce. The only issue with the burgers is the price. It seems a little high for just the burger (17$ and 15$). We also ordered the potato wedges which come with their cream &house chili sauce (amazingggg!)Finally, we tried two of their famous must-try desserts: the Black Out Pie (chocolate cookie crust with fudge, pudding and chocolate coffee crumbs) and the Frozen Lime Pie (key lime filling with a gingersnap crust and chantilly cream)Their drinks are huge (32oz) for the price you're paying!Overall, Buckey will satisfy your fried chicken craving perfectly. Can't wait for summer to try their cute terrasse!!Price: around 20-30$/person"

It came with potato wedges which were a delight (and a really delicious change to regular fries). The 5 piece was more than enough for two of us, the chicken stayed crispy for HOURS and the sauces were really fun (honey, sweet chili and the spicy nosh)... I love sauces and places that give good variety! The packaging is really cute and definitely appreciated especially when every takeout place uses the same packaging. Overall I'm really impressed and will definitely stop in when I'm in the area for another little treat!"

Not me, so when we heard of a new fried chicken joint we had to make the trip. Although the address is in Notre Dame you have to go in through the lane way in the back. The front entrance is only for delivery pickups (Uber Eats etc...).  You can park your car in the back parking lot. The outdoor terrasse is really big and cool. They set up small bar tables all 8 feet apart to respect social distancing. We saw the cashier immediately clean tables when clients left which was nice. We tried the chicken thigh sandwich and the ""beyond meat"" chicken sandwich. They were both very good. The chicken was very crunchy which is nice, because usually they become soggy in in a bun. The potato wedges were also very crispy and the spicy mayo was good (although not spicy at all). We also took the papaya salad which was OK, nothing special. The lemonade is fresh and comes with an optional spicy powder inside it. I was hesitant at $7 but the size of the cup it comes in is crazy. Really worth the price IMO and can be shared.  Prices are on the high side, but sometimes you gotta pay the price for good fried chicken and a clean safe outdoor eating experience. All good packaging is also eco friendly. Great job Bucky!"
/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"""What an experience"" This is what my husband said after eating the food here.  Definitely take your man here for his birthday he will LOVE IT. Paired with a nice cold beer, you can't go wrong with this place.The buffalo sauce is what stole the show for me, it's nice and thick and spiced perfectly. Their burger was very unique and their specialty sauce made my mouth numb and tingly and then seconds later it went away. Just spicy enough to have that extra kick without being over the top. Their fries are perfect and you don't need too many as they're so rich! Super thick. We ordered extra fries because we thought we needed to but you don't.. these fries are so big 3 or 4 fries per person is enough for a full serving so 1 small bag of fries is definitely enough for 2 people. We ordered a bucket of chicken and then realized the same thing you only need 1 piece of chicken per person it's so rich and satisfying you don't need much to get full.I also enjoyed their chicken salad and their home dressing that was served with it.Despite ordering a salad and cole slaw, I like having lots of veggies with my meals so I baked some red peppers at home to serve along with the meal. Definitely a meal to remember!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We ordered Moon Dog's for dinner. The Moon Dog burger has Chicken Breast with chilli jam, escabeche slaw, red sauce, pickles, house mayo on a potato bun. This is a great crispy chicken burger! Definitely worth trying once. Would recommend ordering from here if you are craving a great crispy chicken burger with a reasonably spicy sauce and are looking to try different kinds of Crispy Chicken sandwiches from different restaurants. Though I wouldn't necessarily order from here again as there are several restaurants serving better crispy chicken sandwiches in Montreal, at better prices!"

There's been lots of competition all over the place about whiskey sandwiches lately but you don't need to go to Kentucky to get the real deal, you go to Buckys park in the back go up to the window and get the moon dog. Guys I can't even begin to explain how good this is the potato bun the Asian slaw the sauce my mouths watering just thinking about it. You will not be disappointed and it's a proper sized sandwich so you'll be full on that alone but you can also get a side of there fries and dip them in the sweet chilli sauce. Not enough ? Papaya salad key lime pie house made ice tea are all available too ! I wish my pictures were better but honestly the food was to good to wait try em out and let's rave about the food the people and decor together !"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"They get 3 stars because it's overpriced and while the tenders were good when I previously tried them, the fried chicken on the bone was slimy underneath the battered exterior for the thigh pieces :/ The breast piece is the tastiest and I LOVE their potato wedges  may go back to try their lemonade and/or pies (the key lime one is calling my name). Decor and branding is on point though."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"At any given point if I ask my partner what he's craving, 9 out of 10 times it's probably the beyond meat chicken burger from Bucky's. No exaggeration. Needless to say, as the omnivore in the house, I've become accustomed to eating a lot more fried chicken.When these guys came to the neighbourhood this year I was a bit turned-off from the intense branding they were going for. It's definitely grown on me since and I don't find it as obnoxious as I once did. That said, be ready for a bit of a bro-vibe if you visit.I think where these guys kill it is on the product- the menu is simple but a total crowd pleaser. The chicken is great quality and the seasoning is exceptional. The potato wedges, as others have mentioned, are delicious. In terms of dessert, I've only tried the bananofee pie which really wasn't my cup of tea, but I suspect it's just a pie for particular tastes. I agree that the prices are a bit steep but honestly, I think that's just the name of the game in St Henri now.But for real, take your veggie friends here, they may just lose it over the beyond meat sandwich."

/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bucky Rooster's is all over the social media before and after it's opening. So finally, we marched towards the restaurant. The entrance is in the back. We placed our orders and paid for it. The staff was friendly and helpful with their recommendations. We got 5 chicken pieces that includes potatoes wedges, a bun, a pickle and two sauces. All these cost 36$ plus a slice of key lime pie (total 48$). Bucky Rooster's chickens are premium quality; I am a vegetarian so I brought the chickens for my carnivore family. It was mixed reactions, one loved it immensely, one founded it salty, one founded it ok. I enjoyed their delicious fries and the key lime pie (the crust so so so good). Overall, it was a fun experience."
/user_details?userid=8gZwPyesnY2mDiN5E_pmzQ,Brandon S.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been to Bucky Rooster's twice now. I will attempt to briefly summarize the experience and justify the high price point. Bucky Rooster's certainly delivers on quality of their fried chicken product. The chicken is fried to perfection. Point finale. I am not a big customer of fried chicken in general. So please consider the following under this context. The Bucky Rooster's fried chicken is the best I have had in Montreal. Now, you are in for about $30/person for 2 sandwiches , a medium fry and a drink which does sound a little ridiculous. However, I feel it is justified given the deliciousness and pleasure my gf and I experienced.Re: covid. At least they have parking next to the restaurant so you can eat your chicken fresh in the car! Next time I'll bring a towel to protect my back seat. I will be back certainly and wish Bucky and their staff well. I commend them for their successful operation during this time!"
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I definitely enjoyed the experience. The menu is fun and original. The employees are upbeat and helpful. Even the logo is fun. For the pandemic, the restaurant has definitely taken all the necessary precautions.As for the food... it's very good. I particularly liked the Moon Dog sandwich but it is very spicy, your lips will burn! I tried a little of everything and the quality was definitely there. They obviously invest a lot in quality of the product and marketing an original product, so that explains the higher price point. You pay for what you get. The only thing that we didn't really enjoy were the fries, but that's just personal taste.Great addition to the Mtl food scene"
/user_details?userid=XyZzLPQrBbHOvOXfWM1Tgg,Angela H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is good but it's pricey and I was disappointed to find that the 5 pc bucket only comes with one roll, one pickle, and one small fry. It was an odd experience to pay $50 after tax and tip and only have 4 fries, half a pickle, and half a roll each."
/user_details?userid=7rUqOtD619qf2rCN6n2XXA,Alex D.,"Montréal-Nord, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Too expensive !!!! 75$ for 2 sandwichs trio and you have to tip 15% even if you takeout!!!! Not worth the money and the drinks taste like crap. Go to the dollar store just beside and get you a 7up or something else
/user_details?userid=SW6vc_EBzRhCuJkuVguj2g,Rob N.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This chicken is, hands down, the best chicken I've had in Montreal.  It was delivered hot and fresh.  The chicken was crispy, savoury and perfectly cooked.  The wedges were also great.  The gave a little tub of honey that was the perfect compliment to each spicy bite.  Finish with a nibble of the pickle...perfection.  Do yourself a favour and pay a little more for this chicken, it's well worth it IMO."
