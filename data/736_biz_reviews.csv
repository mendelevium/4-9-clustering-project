/user_details?userid=EfCuN2O6LHmxUleYT1_JeQ,Vijay S.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"We decided to come here for dinner on a Friday after visiting Notre Dame. We were looking for authentic italian food with good wine selection and this place delivered just that.To start, we were given bruschetta with delicious tomato tapenade along with balsamic vinaigrette. The bread that came afterward was soft and sweet and unlike anything we'd had before. We then got the arugula salad as an appetizer followed by the Fettucine al gambier and the filet mignon. The arugula salad was delicious, fresh and very healthy. Good quantity as well. We got the fettucine with the regular tomato sauce and asked for the hot oil on the side. It was quite good and also had substantial amount of shrimps as well. We were pretty full by the time the filet came but that tasted amazing as well in combination with the sauce and the vegetables.They have pretty good wines by the glass at reasonable prices. Service was very good. Overall we have a good experience and would recommend coming here."

/user_details?userid=1_fwIUwAC5NEF3uhCXMaHg,David J.,"Baden, PA",4 star rating,"Quattro is a classic Italian restaurant with a typical pasta and meat menu and all Italian wine list. The background music is 60s American, sort of incongruous. The food and wine are pretty good, but the service is a little slow. The whole thing works pretty well."
/user_details?userid=lAm0Y_3XyE2ZRTty-o1HvQ,Eduard Y.,"Chicopee, MA",1 star rating,"Was disappointed with this restaurant. We went here because most of the Italian restaurants are closed on sundays in Montreal.Service was mediocre. The the kept switches waiters on us. After we ordered everything, waiter comes back to tell us they don't have oysters. Waiter originally stated kids dishes are half off/half portion with exception of a few dishes. After my 7 year old finally picks a dish, she then stated it doesn't apply to meat dishes either.Food was mediocre at best. My pasta tasted half cooked. Calamari was good tho. Other 5 people in the party were also disappointed.When we got bill they charged us more then they said they would for the kids size dish. When we asked about it, manager said it's impossible that the waiter would say the kids dishes are half off. Not sure if waiter was uninformed, or what, but the entire experience wasn't a pleasant one."
/user_details?userid=PH5TjheGSCzt22dyMG_qRg,Tim C.,"Beverly, MA",5 star rating,"Perfect spot, easy to park, and delicious dinner. We got a few appetizers which were outstanding. I highly recommend the grilled calamari and the tasty greens that come with it. We also ordered meatballs, which weren't my favorite but my girlfriend enjoyed them a lot so it was worth it. I had the fettuccini ai gamberi which blew me away. I didn't expect the shrimp to be so large and the pasta had a very nice heat level. The braised rabbit was also incredibly tasty and the vegetables that went with it were seasoned impeccably. I would hope to return again soon."

/user_details?userid=dIUgat-6igSF6hfhYWyhgw,Fred M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We had dinner at Quattro Saturday night after a satisfying March day wandering Montréal and visiting the amazing Leonard Cohen retrospective at MAC.Our reservation email was promptly answered. We showed up in the midst of a light snow storm, which was on a March evening, perfect.From the moment we walked in the door we were wrapped in welcome. It is the spirit of the place, they love their clientele and ensure you know it. Not cloying, not intimate, but embracing in an entirely human sense. The atmosphere is rich without being gaudy. Tasteful without being reserved. Classy in a word We were dressed for Saturday night, but would have been as comfortable in something more casual.She practices a vegan discipline and loved her vegan edited Insalata de rucola followed by a slightly edited pasta pomodoro. She raved about the pasta as the best she'd had.I, a carnivore, started on a gentle note with the buratta which was heavenly... then to a stew featuring wild boar. Fabulous, rich, deeply satisfying. We had a conversation about boars in human history ( the porcine kind) and honored the animal but also the perfectly crisp and distinct root vegetables that made the boar his bed. This place understands wine. She had an Italian chardonnay which she loved. I had a wonderful Barolo... both of which, by the glass, make so much sense and yet are unavailable in so many restaurants, even in Québec.The service was unfailingly attentive and helpful. In a very busy place, the focus never wavered and we felt looked after.As we put on our coats to wander off, the owner cane over to thank us and to look forward to our return.That is the kind of place this is, and we will be back."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We ended up here on a fluke Saturday night. We thought we had made reservations for Bremner but it turns out we had booked the reservation for Monday instead of Saturday. So w e needed a restaurant super last minute and something in the old port. I didn't want to go to just any restaurant. The reviews for this place online were good so we took a chance and called and luckily they had tables available. We got there at 9:30pm and I would say the restaurant was about half full. I ordered the chardonnay and then a pinot grigio. They were both good. The waitress didn't let me try the chardonnay before she gave me my glass which I thought was unusual. But the waiter who served me the pinot grigio let me try it first but perhaps it was because I asked to try it. I do like the wines here. I tried my boyfriend's glass of red wine and it was very good. The wine menu by the glass was written on a chalk board. They gave on small plate with two free Bruschetta. It was very good! I politely waited for my boyfriend to arrive before eating one but I think it would have been even better if I had eaten it right away because then the crunchy baguette would have been even crunchier. We both ordered from the MTL a Table menu. My boyfriend ordered the beet soup but he didn't like it. We switched entrees but I didn't like the soup either and after awhile I gave up on trying to eat it. I'm not a big fan of beets to begin with. I only eat beet salad because its healthy. I had ordered the salmon gravlax with red onions, fennel and capers. That was good. For mains my boyfriend had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and melted smoked gouda cheese and I had the pork shank on a bed of pumpkin risotto. The rigatoni wasn't what I expected at all. It looked more like a lasagna to me. It was tasty though but I would have preferred it with a meat sauce and some chili flakes. The pork shank was a definite winner. The meat fell easily off the bone. The risotto was good and didn't taste like pumpkin at all. Both portions were huge which I like.  My boyfriend could not finish his rigatoni. For dessert I had the homemade pumpkin ice cream with walnuts. It was so good! Think pumpkin spiced latte but in ice cream form! My boyfriend had the Sicilian cannoli. I honestly don't know what the difference between a Sicilian cannoli and a regular cannoli is. All I know is that there were two small cannolis on a plate. One was pistachio and the other was lemon. The pistachio was good but I didn't really enjoy the lemon one because it was too lemony for me. For $31 for three services I felt it was worth it. Besides the beet soup the food was good. The restaurant was nicely decorated. There were tons of art on display for purchase. If I was in the area I think I would come back and try something from their regular menu like perhaps the truffle penne or maybe I would go back for some wine and some antipasti."

/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",2 star rating,"Sunday night and I was craving Italian, so I quickly  clicked on my Yelp app to find a nice Italian restaurant. Quattro had great reviews and the pictures were mouth watering. I called them up made reservations and headed downtown. Of course parking is hard to find but there is a parking lot almost next door to them (you have to pay 10$)Went in, walls were made of brick but nice modern painting made it more up to date. Took a few minutes to get our table ready. For appetizers we ordered grilled calamari (was burnt, no seasoning)Main dish we had pappardelle with rose sauce topped with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella cheese. (Not enough sauce, pasta was too hard very small pieces of mozzarella, portions in my opinion too small)Also with had the linguini sea food. (It was horrible, smelled like sewage) If i had to guess was sewage would taste like I would say it would taste like that dish. Also there was sand in the oyster shells ughhhhh.Did not stay for desert. Overall not a good experience."

Everything was so tasty from the free bread they give you, to the octopus appetizer, to all the pastas. They even make most of the pastas in house.We called an hour ahead and made a reservation for a party of 5, but since it was a Monday it wasn't that busy. Service was great too, they were really attentive and did thorough checks on the food to make sure they didn't include nuts due to an allergy in my group.Before I left Montreal I was so sad I didn't have time to come here twice. Ugh. So good."
/user_details?userid=fuJDOVbemqUaSsS7Vqn4Mw,Filipe V.,"Cambridge, MA",3 star rating,"Not sure why people are giving this place stellar reviews. Aside from the nice interior, good wine, and on the fancier side. However, here are the downsides: the bread was average, and not even hot. They only had one soup (unlisted) which was a gazpacho and not any hot soups. Was expecting at the very least a minestrone. Then I had a dish with the rigatoni. It has octopus which was hard and served as baby octopuses as opposed to bits of it, and the pasta dish itself was stodgy. I think I'll rely on Quebec for just the French food. I was really hoping this place was going to be amazing, after I personally heard this was great but it was nothing more than slightly above average for me."

/user_details?userid=2dshzGEdkVbd9A7QQUnQbg,Lisa H.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"My experience summed up in one word: outstanding.Although the ""$$$"" on Yelp made us a bit hesitant, the 4.5 star rating convinced my friends and I to splurge a little for our last dinner in Montreal. Our meal was worth every penny. We ordered 3 pastas: the Pappardelle, Linguini allo Scoglio and the Penne. All three were heavenly. The Pappardelle (pasta in a tomato cream sauce with Italian dry-cured ham) was rich and flavourful. I usually get sick of eating anything too creamy but the Pappardelle was so good I ate every single bite. The prosciutto (dry-cured ham) was delicious and perfectly complemented the pasta. Overall, a stellar dish and well worth the $25. The Linguini allo Scoglio (spaghetti noodles in a light white wine and garlic dressing with seafood) was also delicious - it was flavourful without being ""heavy"" and had a deep but clean taste. I loved how the Linguini was packed with a wide variety of fresh seafood (muscles, shrimps, clams, etc) - you definitely get your money's worth. Last but not least, the penne. The Penne (truffle cream sauce with sausages) is one of the most popular dishes at Ristorante Quattro and for good reason - it is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. The sauce was very rich and creamy like a typical Alfredo sauce but it had a unique hint of sweetness reminiscent of melted white chocolate. Very distinct and pleasant  flavour - definitely a must-try! The customer service was beyond amazing as well. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and constantly checked up on our table to make sure we were satisfied with everything. The owner even personally recommended specific wines to go with each of our respective meals and assured us that there would be no charge if we did not enjoy his recommendation. He even brought me special Italian chilli oil for my bread when I told him I liked spicy food! Overall, I had an amazing experience here - not only was the food outstanding, the customer service blew me away. Don't let the ""$$$"" stop you from taking a visit because it's not everyday you come across such an incredible gem."

Their gnocchi is prob the worst I've had. It just tasted like a bunch of undercooked flour balls. Pretty sure this is a tourist trap. They served us other people's orders and didn't realize that until I told them. Also never once our server checked up on us to see how the food is while he was checking upon other tables. If you really liked the food here, I don't think you've ever been to a mediocre Italian restaurant.... not sure why this place has great reviews."

/user_details?userid=HmMw6TXiiZM_nIvPBsnG4w,Jason G.,"Nashville, TN",5 star rating,"So, getaway weekend in Montreal. We told the concierge at our hotel we were in the mood for something like Italian, he recommended Quattro Ristorante, called and made us a reservation and away we went. We were immediately met at the door by Vince, one of the owners. He was warm, welcoming, and genuine. He took time to chat, learn our names and was a very friendly start to the night. We ordered our meals, with input, and the food was fantastic. E had the in-house made gnocchi, I had the penne with truffle sauce and sausage, accompanied by the antipasto della casa. Finished up with the tiramisu and the chocolate soufflé (in house made) and wow. This is an amazing place to eat. The staff, the atmosphere and the food are absolutely a must try. This place is great."
/user_details?userid=ge7PvZdAOM-m4SmTnp5vyw,Travis K.,"San Diego, CA",2 star rating,"Caveat: this review is only for the particular meal I had. The service was excellent. If not for the service, this would be only 1 star. I ordered the fish of the day: Monkfish. I had never had monkfish before. It's probably something better left in the sea, or lake, wherever it comes from. Before even taking a bite, I was concerned by how tough it was to cut through with a steak knife. The second bite confirmed the first, a strong message from my mouth to my brain telling me not to continue with this meal. The only tougher seafood I could compare it to is raw octopus. Obviously it's nowhere near as rubbery as octopus, but under the sea (or lake, or wherever it comes from), the monkfish is the next contender. The soup: the monkfish came with vegetable soup. Said soup was oddly reminiscent of campbells. I'm not saying it came from a can - it clearly didn't. What I am saying is that they have impressively figured out how to give fresh soup an uncanny similarity to soup usually stored up against the possibility of an apocalypse. Must have been a rough day at work because I finished every drop of that apocalyptic soup. Again, the service was superb. Would I go back and order something different? Honestly? Probably not. Too many other highly rated restaurants in the area."

/user_details?userid=2p3NfylE1IZdp8wMPk2YJA,Morgan H.,"Somerville, MA",3 star rating,"My husband and I had a very nice time at Ristorante Quattro. Even though the ambiance left a little to be desired (we were expecting something a bit more intimate and less open/well-lit), the service was fantastic and the food was solid. I ordered an aperol spritz to start and it was a monstrous serving in a huge glass - kind of hilarious! It wasn't appropriate for the beverage but who am I to complain about extra champagne. The complimentary bruschetta to start was nothing special, but a nice gesture nonetheless. My husband got the linguine alla scoglio, which was excellent, and I got the cavatelli with speck, which was unfortunately a disappointment. The smoky flavor of the speck was overwhelming and the dish was oversalted. It was far too rich overall. We'll probably try somewhere different next time, but we'll remember our experience fondly, mostly due to the service."

The only thing that brought it down to 4 stars was the price of a small Caesar salad - $10?!?We had the penne with truffle cream and sausage (definitely recommend), pappardelle with prosciutto (would eat again, but nothing outstanding), the fish of the day, and the veal with lemon butter sauce (the latter 2 were ok). We had gotten the grilled octopus appetizer as well...so soft and tender with a hint of chargrilled taste. Yum! My sister was on a hunt for delicious creme brûlée and we certainly found it here.

The manager came by and apologized but did not seem to understand how serious this could have been. I took it out of my mouth expecting it to be sugar but was horrified to see it was a large piece of glass. We were also there with a three year old and she could have been seriously hurt by it. Three year olds would not know what that was. Very disappointed. Comping a desert was not sufficient enough for me.

/user_details?userid=EcCOEfFwgaBmbvIMKi7UsQ,Food Doctor 2.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"Walking into this little place I didn't know what to expect but my Italian coworker knew otherwise- he had picked the place and he only eats at excellent Italian eateries. The owner makes this place what it is. He is very involved in the service, food recommendations, and actually serving and even making some of the food/drinks. He is dedicated to making this place a success. I did very little of the ordering. The Italian coworker and owner did the talking and negotiating of what would enter my mouth. First up was bruschetta, calamari, and antipasti. Mmmmmmmmm. It. Was. Fresh. A+ all around. I think the octopus had just been caught that day and the tomatoes must have been imported from Italy. So nice on the taste buds. Main course: Braised Lamb Shank. The meat fell off the bone with a gentle touch of the knife. The sauce on the base of the plate was perfectly salted. The meat literally disintegrated in my mouth it was so tender. I would eat that lamb every night if I knew how to cook it. Espresso for a finisher. Perfectly prepared, as expected as it was prepared by an Italian. In summary, go here as soon as you can. You're welcome."

It is a smaller place, which I like. I would recommend reservations, especially during what most individuals would consider their dinner hour. Food: I ordered a filet. I like my steaks well done so I asked that it be butterflied so it would lessen the opportunity for the steak to be too well done. The waitress indicated they typically don't do that so I received a big chunk of filet that was definitely too well done. With it, came vegetables, which were cold. I was under the impression that potatoes came with this menu option. On the plate was one  potato slice, like they cut a potato in half, then cut the half in half again, and then cut that in half again. My husband's meal, which was your basic spaghetti and meatballs, was okay, nothing to write home about. We split a brownie for dessert. I thought this was going to be some brownie. I expected a large brownie. It was about 2 x 2. Anyway, not exceptionally impressed for the cost of our meals."

Wish we'd come earlier. A gem of homemade Italian cuisine. Started with the meatballs - wow. Tender and tasty, melt in your mouth balls of goodness. Fantastic appetizer. We also ordered the grilled octopus. It had a delicious char on the outside. Just enough to flavor bit not take away for the delicate taste of octopus. On a fresh salad with simple but fresh tomatoes, orange pieces and arugula. Stunning.  We ordered the puttanesca and the braised veal cheeks. Outstanding on both accounts. The puttanesca sauce was perfect. Salty, briny and with a bite mixed with al dente spaghetti. The cheeks took me back home to my Cuban roots. Fantastically meaty and with the right amount of fat, just perfectly braised. Oh, so tender meat. Accompanied with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Highly recommended as it was part of the fixed price menu. It included soup or salad and coffee or tea. Great tiramisu and cannolis. Highly recommend this restaurant. And Francesco is so personable.

I came in as part of a group of six and the place was empty. The fellow working asked if we had reservations, and gave us attitude when he learned that we didn't. We apologized and were about to leave when he said it was okay and he'd find room... The service was slow, he critiqued our menu selections and yelled at one of our group (who had a late lunch) for just ordering a salad. Its not like he needed to up-sell, we all were drinking as well. After being there for an hour, I asked our server if the food would be out soon, as we had an event to get to. A nearby table of two who were seated well after us got their meals a full 15 minutes before we did. The food was adequate. A  bit saltier than it needed to be, but good. I would have probably enjoyed it if I weren't so bamboozled by the behavior of the fellow working there. We ate quickly.  When we asked for the bill, I indicated to the server that there something wrong on my bill and then tried to act like it was my fault. At this point I was a bit short with him. Not unkind, but losing patience. Let me preface what comes next by saying that I did leave a tip. After I'd settled and my friends were in the process of doing the same, I stepped outside to let others know we were done dinner. Once I was out of earshot, the server remarked to my friends that I was a bitch.The waitstaff called me a bitch. To my friends. We left absolutely incredulous. Never again."

Not chic or professional, which really brings the  vibe down.Overall, I would say the food is very good, but the experience is way overpriced."

Throw in a dynamite chef and kitchen- it's pure taste heaven. I had the Calamari appertizer - delicious. Followed with the tastiest sirloin steak I've had in years."
/user_details?userid=Ht4wIKhpowaA4L0S6yXyUw,Stephanie A.,"Hull, MA",2 star rating,"Very disappointing.... the food is decent, but the service is sub par.  Our server never came back to check on any course and we had some issues. The cocktail was awful... tasted like cough syrup.  When I asked him for something else he laughed at me like I was trash and didn't appreciate good alcohol.  However, as someone who has bartended their way through school and came out with a degree in food science; I can tell you that the melon pineapple martini is possibly the worst drink I've ever tasted.  The oysters were not served with any vinaigrette or cocktail sauce.  The entrees were okay, but very lackluster for the price.  I would have liked a salad and more water, but no one ever came back to check on us.  I'm very very disappointed, especially as I've b en sitting here waiting on a dessert menu and more water for over 20 minutes."
/user_details?userid=SrzcNoThSIYbLfIaDw44bg,Catherine C.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,We decided to make a pit stop in Montreal on the way home and really wanted pasta so we tried Quattro because it had really good reviews. We were not disappointed. We both ordered pasta dishes and after looking on Instagram photos they were able to recreate a mac n cheese dish that wasn't on the menu! It was flavourful and was indeed cheesy. We also ordered an appy that was a taster of their fried appies and it was all delicious and not over fried. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for pasta in Old Montreal.

/user_details?userid=Eta0tfNygqtTomlAG-I3yA,Tarek J.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"This was good times. At approx. $50pp with drinks, a shared appetizer, and two mains, I'd say it was a good value for the quality of food and service. We started with the roasted beets as an appetizer, which had arugula, walnut and goat cheese sprinkled on top. It was an okay dish, however, the yellow beets must have been roasted skin on because the beets were very soft. I would have preferred the beets to have been roasted skin off for a nicer texture, and it really could have complimented the soft cheese, arugula, and yes, soft walnuts. That's another thing. Toasted walnuts also could have elevated this dish. I was actually able to pick up my walnuts with a fork, which is odd. Minus one star. As mains, I had the pappardelle and my date had the gnocchi. Both were incredible and mouth watering, and I'm not even a fan of gnocchi to begin with. I won't go into too much detail except to say that these guys know pasta like my grandmothers know pasta. Plus two stars.There's an extensive wine menu with some pricey bottles, however they serve wines by the glass and actually have two beers on tap: Molson ex and Rickards red. Plus one star. Service and ambiance: not typically too important to me. As long as I'm served cordially and treated well, there'll be no complaints. The service here was great. Since the resto was nearly empty, we had quite a few servers and each did their job well. They made an unintentional error on our bill by adding four coffees to our bill instead of two, and our server corrected it right away. Plus one star."

I was visiting Montreal for the weekend and my partner and I were looking for a nice night out. We decided to go for Italian food and I had read some previous reviews about this place and decided to check it out. It is a gorgeous, beautifully decorated restaurant and is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. The food was amazingly fresh. You will most definitely walk out feeling very satisfied with the quantities. We had calamari, pappadelle pasta and probably the best Tiramisu that I've ever had here. Service was wonderful and the staff were very personable. I will remember this restaurant for the amazing ambiance, delicious food, and the charismatic staff.

Your better off going to a cheaper place and eating just as well.
/user_details?userid=uEVEhPNvDzGeYHyZ9CMdWw,Samantha T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,I cannot rave enough about this amazing restaurant.  Everything from the bruschetta to the chocolate souffle was outstanding.  My father is very picky about his food.  He ordered the veal chop and I don't think I've ever seen him get happier with every bite.  The flavors in my veal scallopini were perfect.  The aroma of the chocolate souffle was enough to make me drool and I think I drooled even more when I ate it.  Definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever dined in.

The host was extremely friendly. I had made a reservation online about an hour before we intended to be there and received a prompt reply confirming my reservation. Turns out we didn't need it because it wasn't terribly busy. Our waitress was also very friendly and we enjoyed talking with her. The food was excellent. I had veal with Gorgonzola and it was prepared perfectly. My girlfriend had the seafood linguine which she also liked a lot - the best part being that they didnt skimp out on the seafood. We also split a tiramisu, which I'm normally not a fan of but can honestly say I truly enjoyed this one. Bill came out to be over $100 after drinks - so be prepared for an expensive time.

The Gnocchi which was the most recommended was horrible. It just tasted like undercooked dough. Did not have enough cheese in it and was maybe a handful. For almost $30 thats not reasonable at all. Did not like the servers as they were a bit rude and slightly insulting. Again the cesar salad was like $13 and so dry and had like one teaspoon of dressing. Also calamari is almost $20 and it has like 2 pieces. Was more disappointed than impressed. They like to cheap out on the ingredients. It was horrible and I wouldn't recommend especially for the price.

We had the Risotto Porcini which was pretty good.  It had nice flavors but they didn't really come together/blend well. We also had a fish dish which I can no longer remember the name of.  This dish was pretty mediocre at best.  It was far too dry and really failed to pop flavor wise.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff extremely pleasant.  I would recommend however delving into more of the traditional Quebecois cuisine when in this region.  We went to Versus the next night and it was absolutely fantastic."

They  clearly wanted to move patrons through as fast as possible.  This is not what I expect for a meal which cost $500 for 5 people.  The food was okay, but not great.  My daughter had the Mac and Cheese, and that was very well done, as were the salads.

This restaurant was pretty much empty with the exception of 1 table of people when we strolled in around 1:30pm on a week day.  This place looks like your typical classy restaurant with a large bar with a wide array of wines, white linen tables and exposed brick on both sides of the restaurant.  Service was friendly but the food was a tad slow - probably because they didn't have much kitchen staff onboard at this time (when I walked by the kitchen, there only seemed to be a couple of people in there). Anyway, I had their lunch special which was $18 for a soup of the day, a main from a short list, dessert & coffee/tea.  I chose their bolognese penne and their soup, we were told, was zucchini but we think it was butternut squash since it was orange. Umm...yeah, maybe we heard wrong.  No matter, I really like butternut squash soup so I enjoyed it.  We were also served crusty bread (yummeh!) with olive oil & balsamic vinegar.  My penne was a bit on the oily side but the bolognese sauce was hearty with the ground meat.  I wanted a bit of spice so our waiter got me some house made chili oil - fantastic!  It gave the kick I wanted and I do prefer chili oil over chili flakes. My fiance had the fish of the day which was halibut.  It was cooked really well - flaky with a seared crust on the outside.  It came with broccolini, yellow peppers & potatoes. He really liked the fish and yellow peppers but didn't care too much for the broccolini & potatoes. My dessert was a bay leaf flavoured panna cotta.  Niiiice!  Never had it before so I was looking forward to it.  It was very good and the bay leaf flavour was strong but not overwhelming.

We then ordered some apps, Polpo ai ferri, Mozzarella di Bufala, Pappardelle with rose sauce more Mozzarella di Buffala, prosciutto and fresh basil, and an Insalata Cesare with extra anchovies.The octopus was one of the best ever, grilled with what we could have sworn was wood, it's smoky flavor was awesome and  it melted on the tongue, it was served with paper thin slicesof onion, capers and garbanzo beans. The tomato and buffala salad was also perfect with fat juicy tomato slices, very fresh cheese a sprinkle of shredded basil and just the right amount of drizzled oil and balsamic.  The Cesar salad was well balanced, and with a made from scratch dressing, which again was the perfect amount, and no anchovies were left behind!  The parpadelle was a huge hit, they must make their pasta in house. the toothiness of the pasta was so good you could really appreciate it on it's own, but the light sauce and fixing made this a symphony of taste to enjoy.  I would reorder this as a main anytime.We then went in for the kill, mains were 2 Costoletta di Vitello, for the gents and the fish of the day (Grilled swordfish) and another dish of the day, Veal scallopini, spinacci, grapes and pine nuts and an extra center dish of Penne Sauce à la crème de truffles et saucisses..  They know their food prep, the veal was a ting a beauty I tell ya.  Perfectly grilled on the outside but delicately pink and moist at the center, it was a very generous portion which led us to believe it would get wrapped up, but by the end of the evening everyone had happily noshed their way until nothing but bone was left, sorry puppies no leftover for you!I did not really try the fish (because I had too much already), but was told by my 3 other dining mates that it was really just as good as all the rest.  My main was the veal with spinach, the sweet white grapes gave the sauce a rich sweetness, that balanced really well with the salty spinach and lovely roasted fingerling potatoes (found in each dish and consumed with great pleasure).The pasta was even better than anyone could have hoped, and we devoured it like people who were deprived of food (considering the volumes of food available this is no mere feat), this too is a must repeat.We ordered some very good red ,which I can't name because  we drank two bottles after all those cocktails so something has to give. I remember describing it's bite to corduroy, and somehow this was generally accepted by all at the table and we were surprised that this would be a good thing, but I digress.By the end of the evening we had met the other owner Vincenzo, and were  told the third of this trio was on vacation.  (in case you can count in Italian, yes their was a fourth but he left after one month, so while the name is still there it is a trio), they were charming to a fault, pros at their vocation, and  masters at the art of picking, preparing,creating, and serving up fine food and hospitality.They happily chatted us up about various common places we knew from Italia, we talked shop, we laughed we cried, it was real.So add this to my roster as a sure bet for a night to remember.....oh darn quick update, when I used the ladies room I saw the bestest thing eva, they have a huge floss dispenser available to clients, so smart, I wonder if one of the owners was a dentist in another life!"

I would highly recommend for anyone in Montreal!"

So Tuesday night, after days of indulging in French food and steak houses, I sought some excellent Italian. Ristorante Quattro did not disappoint. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the filet mignon. My gnocchi was very good and my friend so enjoyed the filet that he called over the server to tell him so. I finished it off with the soufflé di cioccolato and I smiled with every spoonful. Bonus points to the entire staff for being very knowledgeable and full of personality. This is a must-visit when I return to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=jlaZwiyysGx3YnKEh2b8Mg,Tim B.,"North Arlington, NJ",5 star rating,Everything about this place is wonderful. I ordered the filet mignon (medium) and it was cooked to perfection. My wife's pasta dish was also delicious. Desert was just as tasty. The staff was extremely pleasant and the ambiance was upscale yet still casual. Portion size was moderate given the high price.

After 3 days of heavy meat dinners, we were looking for some authentic Italian cuisine. Stumbling across Ristorante Quattro proved to be a great surprise!We were lucky to have met Nino, the proprietor of this establishment, and right from the beginning we were welcomed and treated to great hospitality. Thank you for a great evening!The food was amazing! We started off with the Mozzarella di Bufala. We then shared the Spaghetti Amatriciana and the Porchetta, which was also very good! Finishing with the cannoli and tiramisu was the perfect ending to a great meal and evening.Inside tip: be sure to request some of Nino's spicy infused olive oil. It his creation, has a unique taste, and you will be happy that you did!"

We eat out a fair amount and consider ourselves foodies, we truly appreciate an outstanding meal, service, atmosphere, etc. If you are looking for exceptional service, wonderfully prepared Italian food in a very nice atmosphere, you must try Quattro! Each of the four of us in our party tried different dishes and sampled each others as well. They were all excellent! I can't imagine anyone leaving here disappointed."

/user_details?userid=1X08NjyX5Z0Dstf6l-a6BA,Kevin K.,"Burlington, Canada",4 star rating,Great food. I had the filet mignon and my wife had the gnocchi. Food coming from the kitchen was slow but the staff was apologetic. We ordered a bottle of wine but it was about 45-60mins before we got our entrees. We ended up finishing our bottle so the staff brought us two glasses of wine to enjoy with our entrees on the house to make up for the delay. We ordered tiramisu and cannolis for dessert and a couple cappuccinos. Desserts were delicious. When our server came with the bill she apologized again for the delay and let us know the desserts and cappuccinos were on the house as well. Really nice touch and much appreciated. We will definitely be back for dinner when we come back to Montreal.

I also loved the atmosphere...a great place to have a romantic meal and to have dinner with friends. This place is all about passion. Nino and his staff share their passion for the quality of the ingredients, the great wine and their love of Montreal. They made us feel like family. Definitely try the fresh mozzarella. The Porchetta was tender and delicious served with wonderfully prepared roasted peppers, potato and spinach. And, you definitely need to try the chili oil! Wow amazing! It is made in house by the owner Nino himself. What a memorable dining experience!"

/user_details?userid=wZMMnOhDaeIj0s-3oLhpGQ,Loc P.,"Midlothian, VA",5 star rating,This was an excellent dining experience.  It was not in the tourist section of Old Montreal.  We started with made to order sangria.. It was some of the best we ever had. The grilled octopus was tender and balanced with a citrus dressing with beans and peas. The Caesar salad was delicious. The gnocchi with sausage in cream sauce was outstanding.  The taglierini pasta in a meat sausage was perfect for the kids. My wife enjoyed her pappardelle in marinara sauce with a bit of prosciutto. I loved my veal. Dessert was crazy good...chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream capped dinner. What a very nice place for great Italian food. Very good service. Expensive but worth it.

The gnocchi are like pillows and my husband (who is Italian) still hasn't stopped raving about his spaghetti puttanesca.  The partners who run the place are a delight. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Montreal.
