/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"While we were munching on our delicious Kouignn Aman from across the street, we spotted this bright orange establishment with a flying rhinoceros on its window. As the curious beings we are, we decided to take a stroll across the street and into café Kahwa. Even with my congested sinus, I could smell the aromas of spices mixed with the warm roasted coffee. As we were looking through the menu, our faces shot up with excitement when we saw the merguez couscous but were quickly saddened when the owner told us that it wasn't available yet. However, the chicken couscous was far from a let down. The couscous was as fluffy as a cloud while the chicken and vegetables were flavoured to perfection. The portion sizes are very generous for a reasonable price. This hip spot also has various paintings for purchase or simply to admire while you eat - everything from mannequins to photographs to wild animals painted on birch. Looking for a place to fill your appetite and TOUCH your very SOUL? Look no further, Café Kahwa is it ! Note: contrary to other reviews, we found the service exceptionally kind!"

I trust that their couscous is good since a couple of people ran in just to order it. Some folks were working and some were studying. Nice calm spot."
/user_details?userid=nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,Henry L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Look, the aroma at Kahwa js a combination of hip and Arab. The food is reflectife of this eclectic decor -- visually pleasing, practically disorienting. The service is like the chairs -- unstable. The man behind the counter not only acted like a 3-legged chair, but responded with such disdain I felt the obligation to convert to his hip franco elitist standards. Similar to the wobbly chairs is the simple solution: take out the broken legs and replace them with people capable of providing dignified and stable service. Will not be returning.  The breads food the foods ago."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely loved this place from my first visit. Coffee was good, and the rustic decor really transports you to another place. The only food option is the cous cous which is amazing and comes in vegetarian option as well, totally good enough for a full meal. Im a huge fan of nice wooden tables as well and this cafe is full of it. There are outlets, fast wifi, making it a great place to study. My only gripe would be the bathroom is a bit frightening . But overall it is now one of my neighborhood favs!"
/user_details?userid=cnrl6qxkJ-Qe7fPWhdscsg,Rosanne H.,"Redmond, WA",3 star rating,"Had a bagel here (delicious because it was from St. Viateur) toasted the usual. The overall ambiance here is quite nice and the decor on the walls are very interesting. The coffee is good.But,Will say a few things about the service, the guys upfront refused to take credit cards? It says no where in front of the store or anywhere that the shop only takes cash and debit only. On top of that the guy refused to even try to swipe our cards if they were international even if the credit card was Visa. I was a bit taken aback at how rude he was but i supposed it could just be the situation."
/user_details?userid=Hh9fgQ5tE0Q4n1AXaNaM0Q,Galit d.,"Morristown, NJ",5 star rating,"Oh yum! A little taste of home with a fusion chick twist to it. You almost feel like your grandma is serving your dinner, but instead it's a super good looking Morrocan. The vegetable soup was actually lentil soup but super laden with garlic, cumin, so much yummy green leaves too.Couscous is a different color from anything I've ever seen.poulet and merguez are really nicely slow cooked and are soft. Chicken just melts off the bone. The decor is super cool. Loved hanging out here. First stop in the city turned out great."
/user_details?userid=0nP7RnaaThFgphKUXtaZTw,F. L.,"Rochester, NY",4 star rating,"Pleasant ambiance, good amount of people. Couscous was very tasty---nice soft vegetables, just enough spices---but the sauce was a bit more paste and less soup than I'd hoped, and not rich enough to be really mind-blowing. I'd go again if I wanted couscous, it's less than half the price of many other nearby North African restaurants."
/user_details?userid=R5rc_-cUAhmS-pIVbXpMiA,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An absolute gem! The food is simply delicious - the lentil soup is to die for, but the service is simply wonderful. The owners are sweet and attentive. The atmosphere is eclectic and warm, and it's open late! Perfect spot to grab a bite to eat and just chill. A wonderful hidden spot on Mt. Royal"
/user_details?userid=1qeySudzjk5IFwqwGa_Vtw,Yusuf K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Under-rated. I ordered veggie couscous and got a large portion for $8.50, topped with tagine style whole veggies (zucchini, carrot, cabbage) not small pieces. The veggies were seasoned well and easily came apart with a gentle push of my knife. I'd come back for breakfast, lunch and dinner to eat that.Ambiance: Coffee house, can be busy but I think that adds to the feel."
/user_details?userid=bG2dLL-UvHZeuW1LTahvsw,Dom C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,It is home grown! Earthy warm and good for reading on a dirty Sunday. Healthy coffee with snacks inexpensive to your leisure.
/user_details?userid=FCtJ0J9ujf7qf1yMxSYPrA,Rebecca W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So great! They have chalkboard paint everywhere with drawings and math equations scrawled here and there, and they sometimes have events and live music (came here on a random Sunday afternoon and there was amazing live Flamenco)!The coffee is good and the couscous is delicious.Unlike most cafés, the artists they feature on the walls are actually interesting and relevant and the overall feeling and look of the place is great.Do it!"
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good latte and snacks. I need to try the couscous sometime, it looks good. Nice, laid-back staff and atmosphere. New location is just a few steps away from the old one, just east of Henri-Julien."
/user_details?userid=-rleYbGDq6rR1oTJFWG7og,Marcela H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,Found this cool little joint while taking a self-guided walking tour of Montreal. Great little coffee joint on a cool street.. AND they have free wifi.. can't beat that!
/user_details?userid=La1ggB37gvq6UWpEWaMtMA,Julien F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Middle eastern/arab friendly coffee shop, the guy behind the counter was rude, not respectful and unfriendly, I'm sorry, I'll go elsewhere on the Plateau spend my money or in the Mile-End with the hispters! My americano was good though. Free wifi here!"
/user_details?userid=pq8hKpl-FSbTihJJWx0UQw,Lily L.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,Went to lunch here last week and the food was good. But they brought out the wrong dish....however it's still yummy so we just ate it. The lemonade was great and so was the date square!
/user_details?userid=PZYzVIbqokacJ4LJzNXDAA,Amer A.,"Portland, OR",5 star rating,"We were visiting from Portland, OR and we were taken away by this great Tunisian place! Good customer service , Coffee is amazing and the CousCous is what my great great Grandma would make Amazing. The owner is hands on and strives for perfection ! Best north African food with a cultural twist of Canadian French   !"
/user_details?userid=IUeinVazfx3t2pD_QyieeQ,Tony A.,"QC, Canada",5 star rating,"Really good coffee.....dark, rich espresso....truly EXCELLENT Tunisian couscous, and friendly service. A great place to meet a friend or come as a tourist and hang in one of the best cafes on the ""Plateau"". Two blocks from Montroyal metro, with a view of the mountain."
/user_details?userid=W8K-DwcHGr8NiCTM6lLMcQ,Sandy S.,"Victoria, Canada",3 star rating,"Years ago this cafe was incredible it has a nice mystical energy. Great for inspiration for a project, life etc ..  I appreciated how it was very different from others. Nice cultural touch. Over the years it seems to have lost that. It is not as cozy. The seating is too close and it can get very stuffy. They are not nearly as friendly as were. The do still serve nice teas and ready to go food though!"
/user_details?userid=15jahYwIlCDxMwli520DPA,Kevin C.,"Centennial, CO",5 star rating,"This is a very special, and very bizarre, cafe serving food and coffee drinks in a really cool Montreal neighborhood. The food is a weird mix: grilled cheese, and couscous. I tried the couscous, and it was magnificent. The food is only part of the reason to come here, though. The place is just plain funky. Two rhinoceros heads stick out of the front wall, for instance. The entire neighborhood is really cool, and if you're looking for a taste of what makes Montreal special, this would be a good place to start a pleasant afternoon."
/user_details?userid=fdV5a2WVQW82iAhEUh-y1Q,Colleen U.,"Kutztown, PA",5 star rating,Best coffee we had in Montreal. I wish I had tried the cous cous. I saw it and it looked fabulous.  Service was excellent.
/user_details?userid=mfVvFwYoVs_WVCoojz8JrA,Hilla K.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Decor: Moroccan artifacts and temporary art, some beautiful  (I personally don't like photos of naked women in disguised of art).We went there twice. Once for coffee, my partner had Americano, I had latte, they were both good. We returned to try the couscous with Lamb. I am very familiar with this dish, my partner never had it before. We both declared as superb. The lamb shank just melted in your mouth, lot's of vegetable with the couscous and great flavours. The service was good and the price beyond reasonable ($15)."
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A cosy little coffee shop with eclectic decor. The coffee is decent, the vibe is relaxed, they have a nice little terrace out back, what more to ask for? Oh and they have interesting mugs. Its the details like this that make me really enjoy a place. I like it best for sitting out on the back terrace, enjoying a little sun, drinking a beverage.  It's as close to a back yard as I'm getting for the moment.I find service is hit or miss depending on who is working the counter. Sometimes its super friendly, sometimes a little dry. No matter, the coffee and the vibe are why I choose to stop in."
/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Our friend chose this spot because ""they make really hot coffee, which I value over taste, and tea with fresh leaves, which is kind of cool"". We only got whoopie pie and drinks - tea, coffee, and hot chocolate - all were good. We weren't hungry for a meal - but the cuscus looked good. The furniture is a bit eclectic and make it a bit hard to move around. My girlfriend had to get up so that someone else can go back to their seat. It's self service here - get your food / drinks and sit yourself down wherever you find an available spot. Getting water is also self service - I went for 4 glasses and they had to wash some on the spot and made it a bit awkward. The crowd is mixed - from students with laptops to couples on dates, and the vibe is casual and nice. It's good.. not supreme but a nice hang out for a lazy weekend afternoon."
/user_details?userid=ulbrwY4s1CdcV0nz3Vz38g,Sara G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My favorite coffee place in montreal, and this is coming from someone who's not a huge fan of coffee. I really like the atmosphere, it's very quirky and cosy. They have one the best chai latté i've ever had, and they serve all their drinks in the cutest mugs. They have a good selection of ksumi tea but I always stick to lapsang souchong. I also love the music they play, very eclectic and not too loud."
/user_details?userid=nkXLM_2gga9WN_RfwuvDNA,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Didn't stay here long but I got the Vanilla Hot Chocolate to go! It really enjoyed it!The decor is quite unique! It's a really cozy coffee place! Staff were very friendly and engaged in conversation with us, which made me feel like we were more than customers!They also have a nice terrace in the back! Btw, ""Kahwa"" in Arabic means ""coffee""! Just thought you should know that :) haha"
/user_details?userid=MVj6OU0pqmdwpzVZ2zBOZg,Julia S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Returned here on my second trip to Montreal to find the veggie couscous as savory and filling as ever (I went from painfully famished to painfully full before finishing my portion) and the nice switch (seasonal perhaps?) of a chili sauce for a sweet relish on the side. The staff is helpful and courteous, and the wifi is a great bonus. This is the sort of spot where one can sit for a bit to write, study, or socialize, without fear of getting the evil ""time's up"" eye (does this happen in Montreal? Maybe it's a NYC thing). I haven't had the coffee yet but plan to try it."
/user_details?userid=wYuJmqgL15eZWsIQhcHwfw,Emily J.,"Austin, TX",2 star rating,"We stumbled upon this place on New Year's Day, when most places in Montreal are closed, so our options were limited from the start and this was one of the only places open. We ordered the couscous with sausage which had obviously been microwaved (you can't make this stuff up...), given that some parts were obviously cold (seriously!) and other parts very hot. The meat didn't taste the freshest either, and I ended up not eating it. The americano I ordered was also stale and bitter tasting.  It was so disappointing considering the environment and setup of the cafe have so much potential! I will say the baklava was delicious though! Very flaky, not too sweet and had an excellent flavor."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I loved this place more for its decor than its coffee. Lots of wood, very eclectic and definitely has lots of personality. They also have a small, cozy terrace out back. For those of you who don't like coffee, Kahwa also offers a selection of Kusmi and LOV tea. I ordered a latte that was so/so. It was a little too bitter for my taste somewhat lacking in flavor. It wasn't what I would call,  tasty (I like tasty!). As well, the guy behind the counter (owner, maybe?) wasn't very friendly. I found him to be a little dry."
/user_details?userid=drmTj6FQRWgek_VooTDqZg,Anine Y.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Love stopping here for coffee with my husband after a ride around Mt Royale, especially after those multiple hills. We always stop by after our rides when we visit Montreal. The cafe is cute, sunny and clean and the staff is friendly. The coffee taste great, aka never burnt. Had the latte and americano before and both were nice. Love the math and physics writings on the wall."
/user_details?userid=hYnq9-wO-RzmiTTGMCNJgA,Stephanie C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a lovely café that provided an iced Americano when I wanted to cool down for the summer heat. There's a lot of space to sit at the wooden tables or at the window bar, whether you're solo or with a friend. It's also a great spot to sit and work as a few people had set up camp with their laptops and worked. Kahwa Café offered that friendly ambiance where one could work with ease."
/user_details?userid=ddUsCHQmQr-N4cHMl3S3fg,Jodie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On a snowy wintry day, Kahwa is my type of cafe. Wooden chairs and tables, couches in the back corner, string lights, enough space to move around comfortably--but small enough enough to still feel cozy. There's a big window to let enough light in the day, and fogs up just right to make you happy to be inside.I find their coffee to be a bit weak and watery. Last time I decided to give a latte a go here, but I was disappointed. It  felt like I was just drinking a big bowl of warm milk. No thanks. Their date pastry and baklava is pretty good, it's a nice change of pastry options which I really like.They have a pretty decent selection of Kusmi teas, drinks and desserts. Although I often visit the cafe, I make an exception for mediocre coffee because of the nice ambiance, reliable wifi and friendly barista."
/user_details?userid=JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,Clare L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Kahwa = Coffee in phonetic Arabic translation and this place certain has it.  My first time in the establishment, so I took in the ambiance, and my first sense is that the owner loves this place! After settling my ""office"", I looked around and felt like a chess piece which, in this case meant it felt kinda cool. My other observations:- the square wooden tables, the wooden detailed chairs: all mismatching-ly matching, - the mathematical equations running down a blackboard strip on the ceiling and the pencil art on the walls gave off an energy left behind by a lab coated genius who just made a breakthrough discovery- the terrace in the back - so awesome!- Coffee aroma wafting around the length of the spaceOthers:- An Old Boys Meeting: a trio of 50-somethings taking in espresso and conversation- Solo Macbookers toiling away at their work- bicyclists making the most of the late-morning post-rideI had a Iced Latte and using the Île sans fil so I was set. The espresso was tasty, robust, not bitter but awkward to drink from the bowl type used with a straw placed in it. I chose crispy delicious baklawa, the other desserts are all owner-made . I glanced over at the sandwiches/wraps and made a mental note to try a bit later, with their wholesome looking salad. Bonus: accepting cash, credit, debitAnother mention on the decor - love the thought put into the wood framing, and the apple crate shelving, and the service counter.Alas decor, feeling all chess-piece like, and the allure of the hidden-gem of a terrace could not make me stay because of the hot day + lack of air conditioning. I was melting and very conscious of the rising temperature which blocked me from working, so I forwent the lunch and headed for the next new café with a cold front on my list of should try."
