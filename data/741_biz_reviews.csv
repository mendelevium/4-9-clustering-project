/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great Korean spot right across from the verdun hospital.They have a great menu with loads of option i would love to try.The fried chicken was fantastic I'm not a fan of fried chicken but this one was very tender and crispy with loads of thick juicy white meat. I would recommend getting a few people together this way you can explore more of the menu.

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Go for the fried chicken. Full stop. It's GREAT. Super crispy on the outside and moist on inside. Yum!Had both ""plain"" and with soy garlic sauce. Both wonderful.Price is very reasonable. For me: half order (which comes w yummy pickled stuff and a simple salad) is more than enough. My son loved their French fries (personally, I didn't - but that doesn't matter since the chicken stands on its own).It's like a Korean fried chicken version of Schwartz and I LOVE SCHWARTZ.Will return for sure!"

The gimbap, seafood pancake and beef stew were also delicious. The service is fast and the staff is very nice. The place is not very big and it's located just in front of Hopital de Verdun, 2 blocks away from the metro."
/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love discovering new spots in the neighbourhood. We headed to Comon based on Google and Yelp recommandations and we were not disappointed. First of all, this is the best fried chicken I had in my entire life. Juicy and tender meat, spicy and crispy batter. I had the regular one, which comes with a honey and mustard sauce. Next time I want to try the sweet and spicy sauce. I'm still daydreaming about this chicken. We also shared a beef hot bowl bibimbap. Very flavorful, tons of veggies, side of spicy sauce (be careful ). The meal came with pickled radish, spicy kimchi, and a small green salad.Service was quick and attentive. They came to check that everything was alright, refilled the water multiple times, brought additional napkins and even ran to bring me new chopsticks when I dropped mine on the floor. On top of it all, prices are very cheap! 12-13$/plate. Portions are huge, be careful. I would recommand going with multiple friends and share different plates. TLDR: Go now. Order fried chicken. Thank me later."

I don't know how many times i've been there but I can assure that no matter what, the food they make will always be top notch. Chickens aside, i'd suggest to try their seafood pancakes (pa jeon). They're like a small pizza but crispier and tastier! The only con would be the commute ; good luck finding a parking spot!"

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN HAS FINALLY ARRIVED IN VERDUN - Holy crap. am I ever screwed. I already have an addiction to Korean fried chicken but knowing there's a Korean joint within walking distance of my place puts me in a very dangerous position now because I'll be coming here all the time.I had no idea that they have been open since last May, meaning I missed out on their goodies this whole, past summer.Like most other similar places, you can order either a half chicken ($12) or whole chicken order($22) and you have your choice of sauces. It also comes with salad and pickled radish.I came here for pick-up and service is fast but while waiting I was looking through their menu and all of it sounded good and the other reviews seems to attest to it.I can't wait for summer so I can get the fried chicken for pic-nics by the riverside."
/user_details?userid=Xt6nSdmRlV6WIdqMOmDZNQ,Soohwa H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",5 star rating,"The best best place everThe best Korean restaurant in verdun.I strongly recommend this place good price and big portions all foods delucious specially sweet fried chicken, spicy cold noodle, spicy buldak, sweet noodle and kimchi stew. you won't regret it."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Encouraged by the reviews (because when do I go somewhere without any realistically-speaking), we visited Comon this past weekend for a quick lunch. We arrived at 2pm (an hour before they close for lunch) and were quickly seated in an almost empty restaurant. We got the menus, and ordered a half portion of sweet fried chicken since almost all the reviews raved about the chicken here, as well as our typical go-to's:  Bulgogi and Dolsot Bibimbap. We were quickly offered the standard kimchi, turnip, and salad side dishes which were sadly not impressive by any means. All of that changed when the chicken made its grand appearance.....now, I'm not a fan of fried chicken typically because the greasiness tends to make me feel all kinds of gross, but man is this chicken practically perfect! Super crispy, well-seasoned, and somehow not greasy, this dish was to die for! The half portion was a generous 6 pieces (equivalent to a half chicken) and the sweet garlicy spicy sauce was delicious. The other two dishes were just fine but not amazing in comparison. The price was decent (~$55 including tax/tip) and the service was really quick and friendly. We'd definitely come back but only for the chicken - there are other places that makes the other traditional dishes better!"
/user_details?userid=YCuncSPrpfHHCDPdBxb39A,Chris M.,"Moncton, Canada",5 star rating,"The best Korean fried chicken I've ever had. We got the ""very spicy"" which was actually more like moderately spicy, but the sauce had the perfect stickiness on top of the crispy outside.We had to wait a while for our order, so it's probably best to call ahead for takeout.The prices are reasonable for the portion and all our appetizers were well made, though the chicken is definitely the highlight."
/user_details?userid=XmLoqXXGXbLXH_eaOBIcTg,Mike L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"While driving to Costco, we saw that @comon.restaurant was open for business, in the old Pho Hung spot. So we just had to go and it was their first day open! Bonus!Everything is 30% off until Saturday May 19, 2018!! We had the Korean Fried Chicken with soy and garlic sauce; very crunchy coating. Very tasty! A bit too spicy for me, but I am a lightweight when it comes to heat. We also had the rice ball stuffed in bean curd and the seafood pancake. Kim chi was served on the side. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to try their other dishes. Note that the kitchen closes one hour before the restaurant closes."
/user_details?userid=6r-D64gdm5xSm8V5V3iIcQ,D F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Top notch Korean food in this quaint space with very friendly service makes it worth the trip to Verdun from anywhere in the Montreal area for this gem. All the classics are done impeccably, plus some more difficult to find items. You will be happy you made the trip! Be advised, the spice level here is real!"
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice Korean restaurant in Verdun. The portions are big from what I could see on the other tables. I ordered the seafood pancake and it was more than enough for dinner without any other dishes. Definitely better if going in a group as you can try more things.
/user_details?userid=bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,Thea V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Decided to check out this place this past weekend. We ordered the spicy pork dish , beef dolsot bibimbap, original fried chicken, garlic and soy sauce fried chicken, mini kimbap and kimchi pancake.Definitely THE best korean fried chicken and kimchi pancake in the city. The mini kimbap was good but a little pricey in my opinion. There was a generous amount of pork in the spicy pork dish and the meat was very flavourful. The bibimbap was pretty good as well, the rice and toppings ratio was just perfect. Comon is probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal at the moment. I will gladly come back and will recommend this place to my friends. Thank you !"

I taste a ragout of Tofu, delicious but a little spicy. I loved the presentation of food, the prices were fair.  We went on Friday and there was only a waiter and a lot of people so the service was slow"
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was surprised that there was a Korean restaurant in this neighbourhood so we decided to give it a go. Another surprise was when I realized that they have a lot of uncommon dishes, like fish roe over rice.Craving for it, I got the fish roe over rice. Think of bibimbap, but with fish eggs, kimchi and other goodies instead in a hot sizzling stone bowl. Our food tasted homemade and the service was great. Thinking of trying their Korean fried chicken next time!"
/user_details?userid=vLaMSGUWv7oDcshpep2iWw,Shomoita A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly, the best fried chicken I've ever had! We ordered the very spicy chicken and the whole chicken is huge! I've ordered Korean fried chicken in other places but the amount here seemed massive. I just went there once so I still haven't got a chance to explore all their dishes and all types of fried chicken. We also tried the kimchi jigae and it was pretty good as well. I'm going there soon to try the garlic soy fried chicken and soondubu jigae. The service is a bit slow though, I think it's because there aren't a lot of people working there. That'll be my only criticism, but I can overlook that for some amazing fried chicken!"
/user_details?userid=Y9uJlgOPCCiGh-vmrctMjQ,Stan B.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My 3rd experience eating Koran food. I was very pleased. The service was a little slow, but well worth the wait. We ordered the stir fried sweet potato noodles with bulgogi, deep fried dumplings, chicken bibimbap, and the (not so spicy) spicy fried chicken.Everything tasted great. I eat spicy food on a regular basis so I didn't find the spicy fried chicken to be very spicy, but that's ok. I just added some sriracha after the fact.The cost for all the above came to about $48.We've now been there a few times. I definitely would recommend!"
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Little corner restaurant in Verdun. I don't have to go far now to satisfy my korean food craving. I've tried their fried chicken and kimbap upon recommendations. Kimbap was good. Fried chicken was good too, but I still prefer the one from another korean restaurant. The chicken was crispy, but I find the inside too moist.  I will definitely go back to try my favourite comfort soup.... soon du bu!"

If you're afraid of fried chicken please don't come here you won't find what you're looking for as for the rest of you come and enjoy delicious fried chicken.

The chicken is so cheap and big and all the foods are so awesome! I couldn't even choose what I want because there's a lot of choices and the prices are fairly cheap for the quantity of each meal. In plus, the place is really cozy!!"
