Everyone had told me about this awesome vegetarian Indian restaurant and I've been meaning to go forever and was so happy when I got the chance to. It did not disappoint. Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but it was super affordable and had large servings. I enjoyed trying different plates through their combo platters. My favourite definitely had to be the chickpea curry. They also had an okra dish (okra bhindi) that was quite good. The combo platter came with naan and chapati. Their naans were soft and fluffy. They were able to give me the order super swiftly (probably pre-prepared dishes already). They also have a large selection of sweets that I've never seen before and got to try a few, specifically the rasgulla which was DELICIOUS. In restaurant, they seem to be cash only. Right now due to COVID, they are doing delivery through Ubereats and Doordash."

We went there a while ago with a visiting friend, as were not disappointed!The place was fairly small and cozy, but welcoming. The prices were really good, with enticing options we had to strategically order to maximize the experience between the three of us. The food came fairly fast and was delicious! The naan were hot and crispy on the edges, but soft and malleable for the curries. The richness of the flavors was great. We also tried several of the sweets from the dessert counter. These was very pretty, but maybe not for me (I don't tend to eat sweet).Nice spot, I wish it was closer to my neighbourhood!"

/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For years, my family and I have been going to Pushap. One of the greatest vegetarian restaurants in Montreal. The cooked food seems like home food. Their samosas are so popular on the island, even ""white"" people are crazy about them, as I see and hear at my workplace. Maybe , every month, my dad picks up a bag of 20 samosas, so we can devour them. As per tradition, every year, on Father's Day, we would go for lunch with our dad, and enjoy Dal (lentil) , Chana Masala (chickpeas curry) and puris (fluffy fried bread). I can eat chana and puri non stop. They also carry a humongous varieties of Indian sweets. My personal favorites are besan barfi (made with chickpea flour)and laddoos. I think they branch out in Lasalle and West Island since their popularity has risen over the years so much. Highly recommended without a doubt!"

Their vegan options are clearly indicated on their website. I had the combination meal C that I only had to replace one cheese dish to make vegan. The food was dirt cheap but sooo delicious and filling. I love how flavorful Indian cuisine is and how many spices it incorporates into the dishes!  Note that this place only accepts cash.Main meal:Aloo Gobi (potato and cauliflower curry)Bharatha (roasted eggplant w onion, tomato, and spices)Dal Tarka (lentils w spices and fried onion)Cabbage saladBasmati riceChapatiBathura (fried flatbread)Also came with 2 pakoras, 1 samosa, and a non-dairy dessert (which was a compact brown square, but oddly quite good)"

/user_details?userid=3TQ356XWIEM7DDiiRhMt1w,Sylvio L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A colleague of mine  once claimed that he had the best Indian meal at Pushap, on Rue Paré.  As I was in the vicinity, I decided to make a stop on a Sunday morning. We ordered samosas, puri (fried pancake), paratha (flat bread) and gulab Jamun for takeout, so that we can have them at home for lunch.  We waited for a little while as the puri and paratha were being freshly cooked. Samosas were on sale - 12 for $6, and they were huge.   We bought only 2, because at this price, and the size, there must be a catch somewhere. We HAD to start lunch early to dig in! Everything heated, of course. Pleasantly surprised to find that that the samosas were delicious, crust flaky, with the perfect balance of the vegetable curry mix filling.    The paratha were equally good, and you can peel off layers, like an onion.   Both the paratha and the puri would probably taste best if consumed on site, when freshly prepared. This is an all vegetarian restaurant.   Good thing that we had cash, as they do not take debit or credit cards. Would definitely go there again."

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the most solid Indian restaurants in Montreal! Not gonna lie, I went there in search for samosas after they stopped selling them at McGill for ""sanitary issues"". Went there at around 7:30pm AND THEY WERE OUT OF SAMOSAS. I went there countless of times and they always were full of samosas so this was a shocker for me. I still got to enjoy a great meal there.The food itself was great. I got a thali plate and a mango lassi which ended up to a total fo 10$. The flavors were great and the quantity was good for the price. The mango lassi was very sweet, which was expected for this type of drink. Oh also, if you get the thali, it also includes a sweet dessert. But you'll have to ask for it otherwise they won't serve it to you.Talking about service, it was absolutely horrendous. The place was full and they only had ONE person serving everyone (which was about 30-35 people). Insane. Needless to say, the service was super slow and our water was never refilled. Thankfully the food was good enough to save this restaurant, hence why this is a 4 stars review instead of a 5 stars."
/user_details?userid=lU3ghAEczGs-S9EFCFtJqQ,S S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4 star rating,"Really nice restaurant. Some seating and hygiene could be improved though. Otherwise it has a nice homely feel with its delicious lassis, naans, and curries much similar to the Chaat House restaurants where I live."
/user_details?userid=lRYnvvo-Ia4tJQU4-dMmKg,Annabelle N.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this place! The thali plate is the best option for people who dont really know Indian food. You get to have several different dishes in one meal and they change everyday.  The naan bread is soo good dipped in the sauce. I particularly like the spinach one.I also really like the samosas. The filling with potatoes and herbs is so satisfying and the sweet sauce balances all the flavours. The price is also really good. 6 samosas for 2.50$.Note that this place is all vegetarian but the food is so good you will forget about the meat. Also they only take cash so if you are like me and never carry cash, make sure you prepare before going.The staff is always really nice and takes the time to explain the dishes even when it's busy."

Husband remembered this place from his college days, so we decided to try it out. We got an assortment of the sweets and I literally ate them all in one sitting! The taste is 100% authentic!

I have visited off and on over the years, most recently visiting with fellow foodie and Yelper, Norine. We grabbed dinner there and started with a spicy chana samosa. I love the balance of flavors in the dish! I then had the daily thali with the cheese dish and chickpeas. I always get the baked bread and can never finish the huge plate. I also sipped on a delicious and thick mango lassi. For dessert we had a heart-warming cup of chai and the best dessert: a dil bahar! I was so stuffed that I nearly had to be rolled out and it cost less than $15....amazing prices and food."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you are in the mood to eat out yet are watching your wallet look no further than Pushap.  This Indian restaurant near Decarie serves up mighty delicious Indian food at incredibly low prices.  If you go or went to McGill at any point in your life you might already have had your first taste of Pushap because they supply the samosas for the many samosa sales you see around campus.  It is vegetarian only so it is not the best place to bring a bona fide carnivore but everyone else will probably love it.  Whenever I come here I have my go to dishes.  I always have to start with a chana samosa which is a samosa served with chickpeas and chutney.  It is probably my favourite Indian dish and they do it so well here.  I can never say no to it.  That is always followed by a thali which has a sampler of different menu items.  There is always so much food and it all tastes so damn good.  I always leave Pushap full and content.They also offer a variety of Indian sweets should you be craving dessert.  I can't remember the names of any of them except for gulab jamun but for the most part they are delicious.  Some can be a little too sweet for my liking but that is more a question of personal taste.When I say it's cheap I am not kidding around.  You can easily get a three course meal here (appetizer, thali and dessert) and end up paying less than $15.  Did I mention that tip is included in that total?  How can you go wrong with prices like that?I always get so happy at the prospect of a visit to Pushap.  Sometimes I am in the mood to eat out without breaking the bank.  Fortunately Pushap is there for those times."
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I visited this resto twice in one week! Usually I would order for pickup but I decided to dine in. A small family scale restaurant by namur. Food is incredible and the price is so reasonable! Staff is very friendly. Both times I ordered a veggie thali with a bhatura. I chose 2 veggie dishes of my choice. Really enjoyed the eggplant dish and shahi paneer. You also get a gulab jamun as dessert. It was so so good when warm. We ordered a nice cup of chai which was perfect with the syrupy dessert. I had the lentil soup which was tasty but it lacked some salt. I also had the potato paratha. I wasn't impressed because they used the same samosa potatoes so the potatoes weren't cooked through. I also found it on the smaller side. I did enjoy it and would probably order again in the future. I would definitely go back. The only reason it loses a star is because it's quite crammed up and it was difficult to walk around when it was full.

/user_details?userid=vLaMSGUWv7oDcshpep2iWw,Shomoita A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We went to Pushap last night. Before we were seated, we wanted to take out all the remaining Jalebis that they keep in a tray, as that's all they had left. An elder guy packed it for us and kept it in the counter in a white bag for us to take it when we leave. When we finished our dinner, we found one of the waiters opened our box and served one Jalebi to someone else! And when we were paying he just quickly closed the box and gave it to us! I really didn't know what to say then! I felt that as I ordered the leftover ones anyway, so let's not make a big deal out of it. But the more I think about it, it just seems very unprofessional and weird that they'll open our well-packed box and serve someone else! This place offers good quality food with very little price, I understand that. So I'm sure they didn't make me pay for that Jalebi they served from my packet. But this whole act just doesn't feel right. I have no complaints against the food. It's great but the service really disappointed me yesterday. I don't know if I'll go there again. Giving one star for the service. The place is all packed all the time so they don't need my 4 stars for the food I'm sure."

Vegetarian only menu, but even if you're a carnivore, the food is so tasty, you won't notice that you're not eating meat. I've had almost everything on their menu over the years and everything is made with that hone cooked touch.If i lived closer, I'd eat here every week. Super well priced, and fyi they are famous for their deserts. I've been coming here for 25 years, there are very few restaurants that can keep a customer that long.Be warned parking isn't easy."

The restaurant is very small so try to stay away from lunch or dinner rushes. Also, there is not much parking in the area, so either go by metro or order for takeout. The menu had a lot of variety (keep in mind, everything is vegetarian)- I ended up ordering lentil curry, chick pea curry, potato and cauliflower curry, rice, and garlic naan. It was extremely tasty, filling, and SO cheap! My boyfriend and I both ate huge meals (that really felt authentic- as though the cooks were cooking for their family) for 20$ tax included. I look forward to going back and trying more of their curries!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Kind of a mixed bag for me. Came here to grab a dozen gulab jamun and it ended up being a 20+ minute ordeal. Communication was difficult. Ultimately I got what I wanted and overall I was somewhat disappointed. The coconut ones tasted perfectly fine but the standard fare tasted off. The serving of syrup is exceptionally generous and the pricing was more than fair.I'm willing to try it again and hope to have a fresh batch of gulab jamun.

I try to bring as many people here and they're always super surprised when they see how tasty and filling it is for the crazy low price. The food is always packed with flavor and spices and I always want more. My personal favorite is their palak paneer and bharta (eggplant dish). Their rice is so simple yet flavorful and their naan and fried bread are super fluffy. Don't even get me started on their sweets - I could eat a whole box of them myself. I definitely recommend the fried balls with coconut shavings. So delicious."

Is it tasty, oh yes!We were told we had to take the Tali (might be miswritten) it's the regular plate with everything. Curry potatoes, a choice of lentils or chick peas, some sort of vegetable delicious mush (I don't have any clue what it was), cabbage, rice and of course naan bread, regular or fried. I recommend the fried one as it tasted and looked like a plain and unsweetened beaver tail. It was friendly enough and I would definitely go back to try their big array of samosas. 2 plates for 15$ can't really beat that"

I have had the pleasure of dining here since I was a kid. The owners are probably the most humble of people -greeting their clients only with kindness .i would say that this restaurant is one of Montreal's finest gems to experience authentic local dining . You will find only vegetarian options here, but carnivores be warned- you will fall in love as I did. There samosas in fame can be compared to Montreal 's own st. viator  bagels. You can not miss out on their unique homemade chutney to compliment the samosas. I usually order the samosa chaat (yogurt,samosas, tamerind sauce ), mango lassi, shahi paneer, bhaturas (bread) , a sweet dessert (dilbahar- looks like a hot dog with cream filling), and a cup of chai - all this for less than. 20$ ! Totally recommend this place- for family , dates or study sessions!"

I've often stated to those within earshot that if I had to give up meat, I would gladly take up Indian vegetarian cuisine as my staple. After having been away from Pushap for far too long, I hereby reinstate my faith in the Church of Holy Tabaknak How Can This Be So Good and So Cheap. It's the only vegetarian food that truly leaves me not hankering for some piece of pork.The veg thali prices have creeped up nary a dollar within memory. The chickpea recipe seems to have never changed, but frankly I could bathe in it every day. The fried bread is atrociously decadent and totally bad for you. The desserts are shockingly not sweet as all sh*t, which for me is a compliment of the highest order. There's even one white mass of what seems to be almond flour and pistachios which came off like a crumbly cheesecake. Where the hell did this food come?"

I do point out it's serve piping hot because, the only drawback I can find, the dishes are serve on metal plates which doesn't hold the warmth like porcelain plates. The desserts are average.

They have best samosas on the island of Montreal chances are that if you were at a pot lock or some university fundraiser you definitely came across them! Another favorite dish of mine is the shahi paneer. Here's the thing, I would give this place all five stars but it losses two bc of the service. I was there on a rainy night and ordered the typical dish which was the thali, and enjoyed it as per usual. I ended up lingering a little bit longer than usual (10 minutes) to which the waiter became impatient. The restaurant wasn't full and i had the full intention to pay but she kept rushing me out by asking if I am going to pay, and it wasn't even closing time.

Didn't even ask if I wanted something else to drink!  Very simple yet the meal is delicious!  As always I took home some samosas, gulab jamun (coconut and regular) and they had some vegetable pakora this time so I went with half a pound!  Sure it's a fried un-healthy takeout but everything is devishly damn good!  Parking is quite difficult around the restaurant as it's only street parking in a busy neighbourhood."

Luckily, one of the first places I found was Pushap! I've had veggie Indian food before, but Pushap truly specializes in it. The Thali for the day included a lentil/daal dish, a potato/carrot/chickpea dish, a tomato-based dish, along with rice and bread. Everything was full of flavor and spices, and made me forget entirely about the smoked meat poutine around the corner at BellePro. I also got a Mango Lassi, which was a perfect accompaniment. Not quite walking distance, but a block and some change from the Namur station, so I hopefully I can make Pushap a regular thing!"

The thalis are extremely tasty and filling for the price. All the other stuff (sweets, samosas, pakoras, lassi) is great as well. Service is very difficult at times, some of the people that work here have a hard time serving you exactly what you order. I've had my order botched more than once, which is frustrating. But you don't come here for excellent service or a premium dining experience, so they will only lose a single star for that."

I got the one of the plates with cholay bhaturay, paneer, mix veg and samosas. The food was alright, and the service was pretty slow. Buuut, I shouldn't be complaining, the price is more fair. The quantity you you get for the price cannot really be beaten elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=AStTppA8-jqhDxF2kajwaw,Rajendra Réjean K. C. B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pushap is still good and cheap but I think they've raised their prices ... so, one less star for you. This place got five stars in the past simply because of the cheap cheap Yankee Doodle prices. You could have a feast for two and it would have run you around twenty dollars or so but now that same feast is about thirty. All I'm saying is that if they're raising the prices then they're gonna have to raise the quality and maybe cut back on the overly surly service. Again, everything is as good as it used to be ... just a smidgen of a tad bit more expensive. The chana batura (chickpeas simmered in aromatic spices served with fried flat bread, achaar (lemon and mango pickle) with whole green chillies and onion) is excellent. The bhel puri (a puffed rice street food type snack) is very good. The thali is a good tasting platter."

If you answered yes to these prior questions, then you'll enjoy eating at Pushap! Enticed by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to give it a try and enjoyed it very much. Pushap, a small Indian restaurant near Namur metro, offers a variety of cheap, tasty and filling vegetarian meals. The thali are around $6.49 each or you can get a whole meal for two, including entrée, main course and tea or coffee, for $17.99. Bring cash dear Yelpers, as although the prices are cheap, Pushap is cash-only! Pushap serves big portions yet the food is light on the stomach - a relief since I love Indian food so much but often find my tummy upset at my culinary choices, especially when heavy spice is involved. The reason for the four stars, rather than five? Well, the place, although usually clean, looks a bit shabby and old, decorated with leafy garlands, its walls decorated with crooked Indian paintings. The bathrooms feature a clean toilet but have dirty walls and floors. While I don't consider myself a superficial person and visit a restaurant mainly for the quality of its food, I don't find myself too impressed by the decor.Next time you step in and hear the distinct Indian tunes playing as you cross the door, make sure to try one of their nice meals, or perhaps a dal soup for $1.50 if you're on the go, and don't forget to try one of their sweet cakes - deliciousness!"

We got in an Uber and it ended up taking 30 minutes to get here because it's outside of town and traffic was bad. We had 2 entrees and a samosa each, for 13 Canadian dollars. I wish we'd had more people with us, because at these prices a group can try many, many dishes for a low price. I will go back just for the sauce that was served with the samosas - we ended up putting it on everything. It was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. This is a no-frills place you'd expect to see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives but the food was great."

My boys have always eaten well here but it took my daughter until 2019 to decide to enjoy a curry. Masala chai, a milky tea with spice, is familiar and welcome. The sweets, like gulab jamon and barfi, are fresh and cure a sugar fix. It is a great place to eat; I wish they had a shop in River Sud."

I saved my 200th review for a special place like this!I came here following a glowing recommendation by fellow yelper Hannah B. (given while sharing Indian delicacies at another place).The food was good (I mean, for this price, there is no competition!) and very authentic, though if you spend much more at a fancier place you will probably get something better. The crowed was mostly locals, many of them Indian (and others not!), families, young professionals, and well... the four of us!I arrived first and secured a spot. It was almost entirely full on a Thursday evening, and during our two hour stay there was a constant line at the entrance (of people waiting for take out, not a table). Most of the people seem to get the thali ($6!) but we decided to get a few dishes to share instead. I'll pause to say that there was one waitress for the entire place, and service was very slow. It took about 15 minutes just to get water, and another 10 minutes to get menus (my friend got up for that - she was hungry!). The entire dinner was 2 hours.We were told (in Hindi) to get an appetiser to give them more time to get to us, so we got Chana-Bhatura - which they split into two and served with four spoons. This yumi dish is basically smosa fried skin with channa masala served on top with some fresh onion chunks. We then ordered Chana, Alu-Ghobi, Malai-Kofta, and Paneer-Chilli with some chapati, bhatura and rice.  I liked the Alu-Ghobi very much, the breads were good and the rice was lightly fried with jeera (cumin seeds),  but the rest were not brilliant - I definetly had better Kofta, and the Chilli-Paneer was very oily (but tasty!). It is a bring-your-own-wine place (and there is a dep next door) but I never need booze with my Indian food. I do like lassi - and I tried the mango-lassi but it tasted diluted. When we wanted to order some more it was frowned upon (and I understand that with so little servers it's hard to get to a second / third order), but a nice man came and took our extra order anyway, and came back a third time for the dessert order. We shared a plate on sweets that is made right there: Four Gulab Jamuns (unfortunatly served cold without syrup), and excellent Barfy, Coconut-Barfy, and Milk-cake. The chai was properly spiced!The most awesome part was the bill - for this entire big meal for four, we paid $41. Wow. They say you get what you pay for, and my critics aside - this was well worth the small price (and possibly even the shlep to Namur)."

I witnessed two teenage white boys, young 20-something Middle Eastern men and women, and 30- to 70-year-olds. Sorry I sound strange but these sights are new to me in an Indian restaurant.

All this costs just CAD 7.Walk in, seat yourself at a table and the friendly host will come and take your order. They do have a menu that you can order from, but I have always settled for the thali as the amount of food served is just to my needs. During lunch and dinner times, it does get busy and often see unclean tables.

Every dish is delicately perfumed with spices and fragrances that took you miles away. I had the paneer in a tomato sauce, roasted eggplant with onion and an okra dish. My plate also came with the delicious chickpeas. Excellent not too spicy not too salty. Now the reason lots of people come here are the sweets, I've been sent here by an India friend who think they are better than in India because it's not as sweet. He was right. I was overwhelmed with the variety. Would be back anytime but wish it's a bit far from me, hope this type of authentic Indian food could come to Plateau one day."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After eating here, I only wish that Pushap were closer to my place rather than being 40-50 minutes away by metro because they serve up some bomb vegetarian food. Since I had nearly five hours to kill in between classes, I decided to take a spontaneous metro trip here because honestly I'd be more useful writing about food than trying to find a napping place in Burnside building.I got here just as it opened, so the lunch rush didn't hinder my chances of getting back to class on time. Deciding that it would be basically sacrilege not to order the renowned thali the first time I came here according to other reviewers, I ordered that and chose chickpeas over lentils for one section of it (gotta contain the poops) and the paratha for my bread, which was fried. I also got a mango lassi, and I think the total bill including tax ended up being less than $10, which was a huge steal considering how much food they gave you.The mango lassi was fresh, cold, and had a nice, natural mango flavor that wasn't overly sweet. The waiter later brought out the papadum, and while it's just a matter of personal preference that I don't really like it that much in general, the yogurt sauce that came along with it was really nice and counteracted the spices very well.When the waiter presented me with the thali, I thought that I would be able to finish it rather easily, but I was so wrong. Everything was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it was also so filling that I almost had to request takeout. The onion dish was savory and sweet at the same time, and I think the tomato (?) in it brought an acidity to it that created another dimension of flavor entirely. The chickpea dish was amazing (probably due to my love of chickpeas in general), and it proved a great substitute for meat as the texture of the dish and how it was cooked were super filling. Finally, the cheese dish was super tasty and I would eat so much more of it if I could. All of the dishes were paired well with both the paratha, which was chewy, crispy, and hot goodness all rolled up into one, and the rice. I would without a doubt have tried their sweets if I had the stomach and energy left for it, but I was so stuffed that I had to wait a few minutes before I could pay the bill. *insert sweat drop here*Sidenote: This is a perfect place to go to if you're a carnivore and have a grudge against vegetarians or the Meatless Mondays movement in general. It will change your mind about vegetarian food at a cheap price and is very satisfying, so I would encourage anyone to come here if they are extremely hungry and willing to try something different but delicious at the same time! Happy eating!"

It's a family run restaurant that feels so authentic even though I've never been to India. They come over and present you with a menu but most people just get the tali of the day. The plate consists of two vegetable curries, rice and a choice between chick peas or lentils, and fried bread or not. The pakoras and samosas are a nice addition if you are hungry, but the Tali itself is usually enough for me. A proper milk chai and a sweet vegetarian dessert leaves you more than satisfied. All that for only 7-8$!?!? Incredible."

/user_details?userid=3hAoW2_NqQ7f3M9KaHa7Ww,Maria G.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"We came here based on the high rating and volume of reviews.  After the experience, I now understand that people are probably more excited about the low price tag; rather than a truly authentic and delicious food experience.First off, the service here was just terrible.  We were seated and it took about 10 minutes for anyone to notice we were even there.  Which is usually fine if you're having nice conversation with your date, but in this situation we were hungry and we needed our Shahi paneer fix, and we needed it NOW.  Once we got our water, it took another 5 minutes for the person to come back and take our order.  I remember longingly staring off into the distance, awaiting the return of our server, eyeing the other clients and noting the status of their orders.  And then, I sadly noted others (larger groups) who came in after us get their food first.Ok, what is the big deal you ask? Fine. Maybe the food is so great that it's worth the bad service.  I've been to some hole in the wall dive bar restaurants with food so good it knocked my socks off.  But it wasn't.  Now, before I get all critical about the food, I thought I should mention that hubby and I are seasoned Indian food consumers.  Him being of Indian decent and also regularly frequenting top rated Indian restaurants in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.After all the anticipation, the food finally arrived. All I recall are mine and hubby's eyes slowly meeting over the Shahi paneer dish with the same odd expression and look of confusion on our faces.  We were both thinking the same thing:  Why does the paneer dish look like scrambled mucous? Where did the traditional paneer cubes in creamy sauce go?  What caused them to meet such a blended fate?  I hesitatingly poked around at the puddle, hoping hubby would be brave enough to try it first.  Luckily, my vegetarian thali was up next, so I would get to eat solid food instead of the paneer mush hubby was newly fated with.The thali was forgettable, not unlike the unforgettable mush Paneer.  Low price tag or not, it didn't satisfy our Indian food fix and we likely won't return."
/user_details?userid=wazWs5WpW2lSzvYkkmP9yA,Rebecca C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the best *North* Indian food in Montréal.- The white girl who reviewed ThanjaiI jumped the gun when I categorically declared Thanjai the best Indian food in Montréal while ignoring the sheer size and diversity of the Indian subcontinent. Because if you want a hot and perfectly crispy puri (flat bread) or some hearty chana masala (chickpeas in a mildly spicy sauce) and a side of achaar (OMG THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER okay it's pickled lemon), you're gonna need to go north ... in fact, one metro station north, to Namur, where Pushap is within walking distance.Apparently the thali is pretty popular here (if you get it, spend the extra 75¢ for raita and papram), but for me, it's all about the comforting, soulful, fill-your-belly chana bhatura. For under $5 (tax included!) you can eat a good portion of their chana, one of their specialties, served with a couple of hot, crispy bhatura (like puri but different), some fresh onion slices and a couple green chilies, and a serving of achaar. ACHAAR! This is the kind of thing I find myself wiping the residue of off the dish with my fingers if there isn't any bread left.""Why does this person's race matter?"" you may have asked upon reading my opening paragraph. Well, as a white person of northern European heritage, I was raised on a diet of baked potatoes and Tuna Helper, and the strongest spice I ever tasted was a light sprinkling of black pepper. I'm happy to say that I've come a long way in the past few years, but I still prefer my food pretty low on the Scoville scale. There are nevertheless some exceptions to this, of which ACHAAR (or Indian pickle) is a significant one. The principal ingredients of achaar are magic and deliciousness that punch you in the face with flavour, although I'm pretty sure lemon and spices figure in there too. While in Thailand this summer, I discovered the delicious sour-and-spicy tom yum soup, and realized that sour spiciness is a whole 'nother ball game from regular spiciness, a ball game I was a lot more interested in playing. I find the sourness really cuts the spiciness, but my partner finds that sour intensifies spice, so disclaimer: I have no idea what will happen when the sour-spice hits your individual taste buds. My advice to have some raita (savoury yogurt) handy to control any damage stands. Like a lot of Indian food, the chana will start off pretty mild but halfway through you might notice a taste bud smolder that will grow into a fire if you keep feeding it.Getting back to Pushap, you can get a pretty good plate of comfort food for under $5, but if you've hauled your ladoos all the way out to metro Namur, why not go all the way? For $30, Raj and I can eat ourselves into a food coma with appetizers, drinks and sweets to go with our chana bhatura and/or thali. Don't miss the lassi if you're getting drinks. The only way to go wrong with the sweets is not getting at least one. Appetizer-wise, the chaat papadi is amazing and the samosas are pretty good too. I wish I could recommend the cheese pakora but I can't because I've never tried it because they always seem to be out! If you've had it, please let me know so that I know it isn't just a mystical legend of fried balls of cheese.Ambience-wise, I'd totally recommend Pushap for a date. It's festooned in multicoloured string lights that make it look like it's always Diwali or Christmas, but between the Bollywood tunes playing on the sound system and the traditional Indian paintings of couples tastefully giving each other bedroom eyes, this place says ROMANCE. Just be careful not to eat so much that you need to waddle out at the end of the date ... some advice I could probably stand to take myself."

/user_details?userid=tAtblebDRTiB9TkAxupncQ,Ivan M.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.Slightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. I'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came."
/user_details?userid=Cwkb0lYxcGk5H4Yg2zMKlg,Richard Z.,"Irvine, CA",1 star rating,"This place was utter garbage. We had palak paneer - too greasy, not good. Paneer makhani or tikka masala, not sure which because the sauce was basically white with red flecks, and not good. We had a chana masala (presumably) dish and it was mushy and didn't taste like any I've ever had before. Honestly, if this were the first Indian food I had ever had I would never ever return. And the cashier shortchanged me. So... Eat here at your own bloody peril. **in fairness, this is the only Indian food I have ever had in Quebec. If this is always what it tastes like then my apologies to the entire staff of Pushap except for the person who stiffed me and also as a general note to all québécois, the world of Indian food has so, so much more to offer you."

They had a wide variety of vegetarian plates to pick from and the prices were very affordable. I did not expect to walk out with a full stomach for what I had ordered.The only negative aspect was the service, although the waiter was very nice and polite, it took 15 minutes to get a menu and another 30 before he took my order.  It probably didn't help that he was the only working waiter to serve a house full of clients.4.5/5 Would go back"

Samosas: In my opinion, absolutely fantastic. They were not warm but yet, full of flavor.Paneer: truly felt home cooked. Cholle: again, fabulous. Just wished for a little onion and cilantro.Potato Sandi with green peas: this was my least favorite simply because I think there was no ingredient to tackle the fresh sweet peas and carrots.Chappati: amazingBatoora: fantastic flavor. On the oily side but hey, it is a fried item.When I come back to Montreal,  definitely coming here again."
/user_details?userid=zR2RIA8HL2YoRwuwy-4E6g,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great food at great prices sums it up.The daily Thali would be your best bet as a new comer as it's almost always good and is a way of tasting a few of their offerings. There are variations of it that you can choose. The Thali consists of two veggie sides, rice and their tasty version of coleslaw and regular or fried Nan. The spice is just right.Their Sambosas are amazing.I tried several of their dishes aside from the Thali on several visits and i have to say I was never disappointed once. For drinks, they have a good Mango Lassi but I prefer the Salted one.The have various deserts which are displayed in the fridge at the entrance.I think the place is cute and cozy with nice music playing in the background. The service was never rude on several visits but just a bit hurried given the busy nature of the place.Just a tip, whenever you order any take-out, make sure the associated condiments are included as they tend to forget them. Be sure to always ask for their Achaar (indian pickles) as well as the Sauce that comes with the Sambosas.One of the few places I recommend to any visitors to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=iJs63-OOhaD2JvDOJcA4Lg,Alex M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hells yeah Pushap! You walk in and the FIRST thing you see is a glass display at the back that's filled to the brim with a gazillion amazing tiny sweets of varying colours, some dry, some damp with syrupy goodness. A full, vegetarian-only menu with tons of very reasonably priced options to choose from. But then again, the taly's cheap and filling and amazing as it is and the food's spicy and greasy. And in all likelihood, you'll be full up by the time you leave so you might have to take some of those sweet deserts to go.And though it's a bit far if you're a plateau-ite or some such, why not make an afternoon of it? Bring a backpack and stop by the Sally-Ann or some of the discount stores nearby? Find out when the Orange Julep is having a car show or bike up with a bunch of buds and go race on the hypodrome track and go urbanexplore the building."

I personally don't find the food very tasty and I find it to be very oily. It's very cheap however and generously filling so it's a cheap eatery. The Mango Lassi and Samosa (I would get them as an appetizer rather than the other appetizers in the menu) are both actually very good. The sweets are a bit disappointing compared to original Indian standards however.

Come hungry because while any individual item is a reasonable portion, everything is so good you won't want to leave any on your plate for silly reasons like being too full!

/user_details?userid=FX_srmY437yj75Ax9xVkHQ,Chris H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Pro:- Delicious, tasty food. I love everything I've ever ordered here, even though I have no memories for indian names.- Fresh, crunchy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside samosa dough that just screams ""Fresh!"" and ""Manually Made!"", with tasty spicy potato filling.- Big big portion, made even more impressive by the small price. (Large-size man-portion thali for 6-7 dollars). - Cheap dessert, large selection.- Fun decors.Con:- Always busy and a bit short-staffed. Abrupt and minimal service.- Vegetarian only.- Since it's so popular, and the restaurant only seats 7-9 groups. You might have to wait in line on a weekend.Summary:The best Indian restaurant in Montreal for me any day of the week, except on the day that I'm craving meat."

I would have been ordering my food couple of times a week if I lived there. Even though the owner was short staffed that day and busy, the food came out pretty quick and fresh."

We were a group of 12, so we ALL wound up with the same order, despite the fact that those sitting at the end of the table, CLEARLY stated we wanted naan, and NOT the fried bread. The thali was very good, albeit somewhat greasy (eggplant especially). The chai was OK, not exceptional, the plain, spiced tea not.  Service was SLOW, but then again, see above, but I suppose this is part of the reason why the prices are soo cheap & the crowd just keeps on coming. Overall, some of the best cheap Indian food I've had in the city, definitely worth the trip. Meat eaters, good luck; this place is strictly vegetarian"

No matter how far away I have ended up living from Pushap I keep coming back here. There's a menu but most people just stick with the taly of the day with either the chickpea or lentil talys.  Ordering off the menu generally takes a lot longer to get the food.  If you go with the taly of the day, for about $7 you can get a huge meal (two talys, rice, salad, nan, dessert, and a chana samosa).  Best deal in town. Located close to the metro so its easy to get to. Service is generally very good. If you don't finish your food, you might get scolded and probably won't get your dessert. The owners are very friendly though and loyal to their repeat customers (I usually get a few extra sweets in my bag or extra helpings of chana samosa). A true gem in this city!"

If you are a first timer you can order a thali which comes with two dishes of your choice, chapati and rice. Although it should be enough but I was so hungry (or greedy) that I ordered a Channa Pathoora as backup as well. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
