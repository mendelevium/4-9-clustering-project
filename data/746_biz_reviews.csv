I'm so used to agusto el gusto which is across the street but since they shut down I didn't think I would ever get my famous shrimps again but I was wrong. Villa Wellington Owens agusto or should I said owned, either way I'm happy the best shrimp are still around.I got the garlic shrimp which are so juicy and fresh that you can't help but almost swallow them whole. The salad is great the sauce is a house one taste like mustard and eggs not 100% sure but it's the go to.Plates are anywhere from 19-25$Sangria we got was made with love got a extra shot which was $8 not cheap but wtv.Place is great should be a byow as prices are a bit steep but overall delicious meal and I can't wait to return."

A diverse menu that does justice to this underrated great cuisine and offers something to everybody in generous portions!Bonus: For the fans exotic meat. This is one of the few places in towns where you can eat hearts/kidneys and rabbits!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Gave this resto another shot and this time it fared better.  I ordered the can't-go-wrong Lomo Saltado, which is a dish you can order practically anywhere in Peru.It's a decent tasting plate but a huge portion! The beef was slightly tough and dry... Either it was overcooked or they could've chosen a better cut of meat. The rice they serve on the side is tasty, seasoned very lightly. The seafood rice was pretty good with lots of mussels, some calamari, bit of octopus and some scallops. It's good but could use a bit more flavor. What I really liked was the oven hot crusty bread served with butter and spicy green sauce. Now that was good. The green sauce is oniony and goes well with bread and for the lomo saltado. Service is friendly so I'd still give them 4/5 even if the food is weaker than I would hope!"
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I love Peruvian food and I was disappointed at this place. The ceviche was terrible, bad quality fish, badly sliced and probably not left enough time in the lemon juice. El Aji de gallina wasn't good as well (being that one of my favourite Peruvian dishes). And we also ordered a Mexican dish which was pretty standard, nothing great about it. I don't recommend this place if you are looking for a good Peruvian restaurant.On the good side, their homemade hot sauce was kind of good, fresh. The waiter was kind enough to give me some to take home. That was cool."
/user_details?userid=y-mwVNTsWOFxRsdcvdGVlA,Marc M.,"Sainte-Thérèse, Canada",3 star rating,I liked the food. We were close to 20 people and filled up half the resto which might explain why they had problems with service. They have problems with logistics but the food makes up some of the short comings. The tamale was ok with not much meat it it. The salad as an entree was excellent. We ordered the mixed fish dish for two. It was huge but the fry got to us. It was quite greasy. They have a good selection of drinks. Other dishes served looked appetizing. Reserve!! Unless you don't mind waiting. Very popular.

Service tres attentive. Prices very fair. What more can you ask for? I was pleased that the guacamole dip was not too salty, which is often the case with other restos. We vacuumed up the chips and guac in about three minutes. Highly recommend this place.As for the mains, mine (can't remember the name) - chicken, peas, and roast potatoes - was excellent. It was equally good the next day, thanks to the doggie bag I took with me."

It was served with a red tomato sauce which was bland but the green sauce was amazing.For mains I had the Shrimp fried rice (can't remember the correct name), the portions were huge and it had at least a dozen big shrimps which is great for the price which is around $20, but unfortunately, my palate could not taste any seasoning apart from salt, I'm no expert in Peruvian cuisine but I'm pretty sure that's not how it was supposed to taste. My friend had the chicken and shrimp, she asked for no salad and was served a dish with salad. She enjoyed the shrimps with the garlic butter but the chicken was bland along with the plain white rice which should at least come with a sauce as grilled chicken and rice makes for a dry feeling.Service was terribly slow (kitchen speed was fine), the waitress seemed overwhelmed and very inexperienced, and the restaurant was not full. Two tables that came after us were served before us, getting water took over 20 minutes, ordering a drink took at least 15 minutes after getting the water, there were two dirty tables next to us that had dirty plates and glasses on them and they were never picked up for over an hour and a half, and I even saw them seat a group of 4 at one of those tables which is unacceptable in this industry."

Villa Wellington struck me as either Italian or French cuisine, but not Peruvian. But don't let the name stop you from coming here! The food is delicious.Here's what we ordered at our table:-Pescado Suado: wished I had ordered this! Basically fish in tomato sauce with chicken-broth rice... very flavorful and satisfying!-Ceviche de pescado: very citrusy and good! This would have been great with rice as a side to neutralize the tangy and sour taste, or great as an appetizer but not an entree.-calamari: and I loved it with the green sauce they had. It was spicy and had a kick versus the marinara sauce."

/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I tried to like the ceviche, but it was too salty! Sorry, the staff was so nice, the lady there reminds me of my mom. What I can say I loved were the anticuchos, I would come back for those in a heartbeat. The jalea was not my favourite, but the causa left me wanting a second portion. This is not a critique to the restaurant itself, I just found it peculiar that they offer Mexican and Italian dishes, the couple sitting next to us were eating some sort of tacos and the other pasta... I was so confused, but I guess it's just that people here are more familiar with that and it sells? I bet Mexican and Italian with Peruvian ingredients would be delish though, just not what I would order if I go to a Peruvian restaurant."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Stopped by here yesterday with some friends for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The four of us arrived around 3:30pm and were seated immediately. The reviews on Yelp encouraged us to try the calamari, Papa Rellena, Arroz Chaufa de Mariscos which we ordered alongside the chicken salad, the octopus appetizer, the beef liver dish, and a steak dish with rice, plantains and an egg. We were quickly offered some warm bread with the most amazing spicy dipping sauce which we inhaled (literally that delicious). The appetizers came out quickly after, and everything was pretty good. The calamari was great, octopus meh (only thing we didn't like the entire meal) and the Papa Rellena was as good as everyone says it is! Main meals were all also excellent and MASSIVELY portioned. Our bill for one beer, two appetizers, a salad and a main came to $71 including tax and tip which is slightly expensive for lunch but given the portions, it's acceptable. Overall a solid 4.5/5 for amazing service as well as delicious and generously portioned food!"

Yelp correctly told us that this Peruvian place is open throughout the afternoon. The place is cozy with lots of Incan decorations. We tried the Jalea, which is a dish of lightly battered and fried calamari/shrimps/fish, topped with some fresh onions. Squeeze some limón on top and it was so delicious. The stuffed potato was filled with ground beef, olives and an egg yolk, tasty as well. I would definitively come back to try some of their other dishes in the future."

The guy who served us was really nice and attended to us really well. My friend had the Ronda Caliente I believe, it's a seafood filled plate and the amount was generous enough that my friend had enough for takeaway. I had the Fajitas Carne and it was served in a sizzling plate that reminded me of my favorite dish in my country. On another plate, they gave me the wrapper and the sauces and you roll the meat on your own. I loved it, the dish was super good and I plan on going back there soon to try an actual Peruvian dish. Shame I forgot to take a pic in my excitement to eat!"

/user_details?userid=k2qyzc1yQc6UppJLKDCHCg,Stella O.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"My very first Peruvian experience. Came out bloated (isn't easy for a foodie like me to say) and grinning from ear to ear. The staff looks all Peruvian. The menu, though, is a hotch-potch of Peruvian, Mexican, Chifa (Chinese style), Italian, and some standard North American. That, in no way, takes away from the experience. Peru is a country of diverse ethnicities and thus diversely influenced cuisine. I ordered a can of Inca Kola, which automatically comes with a glass to pour it in, minestrone soup with basil, and lomo saltado. Been waiting to try the lomo saltado for a couple months ever since my Peruvian friend said it's his favorite dish. Boy is it huge! I had to take a third of it as leftovers, yes, and I did mention I left bloated. Mix in the rice with the beef and veggies before taking a mouthful. And whoa! Inca Kola is like addicting. If you like A&W root beer or creamy soda of any kind, you'll like Inca Kola. Chicha morada is equally good. It looks similar to red sangria, but tastes like spiced fruit juice."

The service is good, most of the servers speak Spanish first and French second, then English if even.. The restaurant is decorated very Peruvian like, with the walls covered with Chullo's, pictures and small Inca statues. My favorite meal is the Jalea  plate, which is massive, big enough for two people as a main meal, or shared among a group as an appetizer. Ceviche isn't my thing but everyone i've been there with loves it. They have a very large menu of traditional Peruvian dishes and beverages including Papa Rellena & Chicha Morada (a traditonal beverage made from purple corn) or you can always go for a Peruvian soda call Inka Cola. Price is moderate, well worth the amount of food you get and the quality of food! :)"

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We then ordered the small dish of Jalea. This dish encompassed everything perfect for a summer nighttime meal, seafood and FRIED. This dish is a trio of shrimp, calamari and fish, with a bonus player of potatoes.The batter was perfect, not too thick, and thin enough to add a nice bit to the seafood. I especially appreciated the onion slaw on top that had just the right amount of vinegar to cut through the oil and heaviness of the batter. Like I said, this was the small order, and were told that it's a personal portion, and the large was meant for two. As you can see, they obviously meant it would be enough for one person, should that person be a professional wrestler or a reality show reward challenge."

Considering the fact that I've never been to a Peruvian resto and was quite hesitant as to what to have, it was a major plus. I dont remember the name of the meal I've ordered but it was in the appetizers section. It was something like a layer of mashed potatoes , a layer of shrimps, another layer of mashed potatoes so on and so forth. Absolutely delicious. Spiced perfectly. I will definitely go again.

I was a bit disappointed as it seemed more salty than fragrant. My friend had the fish stew and that was very well balanced. Also I ordered the cevice as an appetizer and found it gigantic. I would have liked to get half of it for half the price that would have been perfect.
/user_details?userid=G8M4H_3OwVYld36Xrzu_Bg,J.F. H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I tried this place on the recommendation of one of my coworkers who lives nearby.  She couldn't stop talking about this place and how it was one of the best places for Peruvian food in town. Now I can't say that 'm an expert on Peruvian food and this is the only Peruvian restaurant I've been to, so I'll reserve my comments to what I know.Let me start by saying that with a name like Villa Wellington I was sure this place was a souvlaki place! But boy was I wrong.When you first walk into this place you notice it's colourful table cloths and cozy feel. Our waiter greeted us at the door and showed us to our table, he was all smiles and instantly made us feel at home. He was incredibly helpful and nice and when he found out it was our first time visiting the restaurant he took it upon himself to make sure we had a good experience. We never felt rushed even when there was no one left in the place they made sure we knew we could stay and take our time. I have to give the service 5 stars.The food was great we ordered a little bit of everything tapas style and shared it between the two of us and we were both surprised at how good the food was the only dish which we found to be ordinary in comparison with the rest of the food was the calamari, not that it wasn't good but it regular calamari as opposed to great like the other dishes were. The sea food ceviche was awesome, it tasted so fresh and light I could eat that alone everyday. We then had Papa Rellena which I had never had before and they were also awesome. Everything was just very good.I found one little funny thing, I think this may be a left over from the neighbourhood Verdun use to be. When you look through the menu you'll notice Italian, Canadian and what seem to be non Peruvian dishes. I suppose this is to make sure everyone can find something to eat, even if they aren't sold on Peruvian cuisine. This is definitely a place worth trying and proof that Verdun or as my friend Rod calls it the Wellington village is really becoming a great little neighbourhood.I hope you enjoy!"

Unfortunately the French restaurant was replaced by a sushi bar so we decided to try to find another place to grab supper. We asked someone in the street who turned out was Peruvian and recommended to go check on Villa Wellington. Their chicha morada was great, the plates were huge, their aji was delicious and the prices were much better than what we use to pay back in California.

This place was awesome! Apparently, its quite good as there is usually a line for tables, but we were lucky, and got a table right away.  The waitstaff only speak Spanish & French, and I believe that the menu is in French.  We ordered calamari, a steak plate, chicken in tomato sauce, and a traditional Peruvian dish with potatoes & chicken (sorry, don't remember the official names as there were all in French).  When the food came out, the portion sizes were huge! The food was very flavorful, the meat was tender, and the homemade sauce was amazing.  All the dishes that we ordered were fantastic, and better yet, there were leftovers for the next day."

/user_details?userid=iwDP-y8NJG3Vem2z242LDg,CalamityJane T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I swung by Villa Wellington a few days ago for an early dinner with a friend. I was getting tired of the grease-fest that was turning out to be the theme of my trip and I also kind of wanted something healthier (no such luck, mostly) and flavourful. I'd been to VW once before, a few years ago, but I don't remember what the dish I had was called, only that it was a stewy beef on rice concoction, a reddish-brown sauce infused with coriander, which didn't taste as good at the resto as it did the next day when I had it as leftovers. I had hoped to get that dish again as I tried without success to lay off the grease with this one meal. We were in a bit of a rush that night as we had a show to go to downtown so we had to skip the apps portion of the meal, but not the booze. ;) Thankfully we made a reservation about an hour ahead as it was rammed when we arrived (it was packed the last time too), and there was a constant flow of people coming and going the whole time. Note that tables are also placed very close to one another so at times you may feel suffocated. Service was efficient, and we were seated once we announced our reservation. Upon ordering, a basket of warm focaccia rolls (one each) and butter were brought over. I was unable to locate the dish I had before, though I was sure I was on the right track when I'd asked for the coriander beef with rice and beans. We shared that along with a small jalea (another popular dish). The beef dish was not at all what I had the last time but it was still good: small pile of rice, stewed beef brisket in a mild brown gravy, along with a ton of beans in another mild gravy, but a gravy different from that of the beef. I don't know if this dish is supposed to be bursting with flavour but it wasn't, though still very fresh and good. I noticed a few other tables had ordered this as well. Not bad but there wasn't really any noticeable coriander present which was a shame. The jalea came in a tall bowl containing a heaping pile of breaded, deep-fried seafood, just as the menu stated: calamari, shrimp, and fish. All this under a pile of onions that were not too onion-y and useful for bringing alive the beef dish a bit, but also a handful of fried, slivered potato. The jalea was not at all greasy and all those heavenly bits were cooked to a perfect golden-brown, served with their creamy light-green mild hot sauce (it wasn't really hot, and I have no idea what the name of it was) and mayo (I thought it might be aioli but it wasn't). Most of it was calamari and too few pieces of fish--I couldn't tell what kind of fish it was but it was white, dense, and moist. Most likely a generic one that one finds in their grocer's freezer. Portions were quite big such that we couldn't finish more than 2/3 of the meal--even I was shocked that we didn't finish as we are both big eaters! I was sad to be leaving behind so many morsels of fried seafood uneaten but what else could we do? We gave it our best shot.I think the menu may have changed a bit since the last time I was there, but I could see that the Mexican and Canadian sections still exist. There were a handful of dishes I would have liked to try so I'll have to check them out again another time. What I really wanted was the papas rellenas but it only came in appetizer format, although given their portion sizes, an appetizer at this place probably would have been sufficient as a meal! I'm not a seasoned Peruvian cuisine connoisseur but Villa Wellington comes highly recommended by a lot of my Montreal friends and it's worth a try if you've never been."

César V.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"First, I must disclose that being married to a Peruvian who is most demanding about about anything culinary and, particularly Peruvian cuisine, I have come to be somewhat more demanding myself. That being said, I would recommend this restaurant even though I gave it only three stars. We sampled the chicha morada, a non-alcoholic drink made from purple corn with some citrus and cinnamon added, and were comforted to find that it was fresh made (as opposed to mixed from powder).The papa a la huancaína (potato in a Huancayo style), a Peruvian staple presented in regional variations, was a good appetizer, its fresh ingredients noticeably tasty. For my own personal taste I would have preferred a touch of spiciness, but hey, this would not be a valid reason to down rate it.The papa rellena (potato with a meat filling) did not fare as well, the filling tasted a little on the greasy side.The seco de cordero, a sort of lamb stew with beans and rice, came in a very generous portion and did not disappoint. Again, the fresh ingredients carried the day!Unfortunately, we were to full to taste dessert, a project for another day.The service was very good, even my picky spouse agreed that it is a restaurant worthy of a return visit."
