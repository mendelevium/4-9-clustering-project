/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Average sushi at a reasonable price. I ordered the midi special for $16. It's a chef's selection so maybe I should have ordered off the ala carte menu instead. The rolls were 4 pieces of cucumber, 4 pieces of avacado, and 8 pieces of seaweed wrapped misc fish. The special also included 4 pieces of nigiri (cooked shrimp, salmon, tuna and some kind of white fish). There was nothing wrong with the meal, I just walked away feeling full of rice with nothing memorable about the fish. The service was good and the small dining room was OK, although dominated with a large open air cooler used to store beverages and pre-made take out fare. I'll likely go back to try one of the specialty rolls but I wouldn't go too far out of my way for this one. My search for good sushi in MTL continues..."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ordered delivery from Sozo (using UberEats). The sushi is definitely better than most delivery options in town. A good variety of options. I particularly liked their softshell crab maki (spider) and their fried maki with cooked salmon (dragon eyes). I was less excited by their tuna nigiri and their eel maki roll with lettuce, avocado, roe, and tempura crisps. Regarding the former, mainly because of the quality of the tuna. Regarding the latter, mainly because of the tiny amount of eel in the roll (I could barely taste it). Despite these imperfections, I will most likely order again (for delivery).Remark: I'd give 3.5 stars here if the option was available."

The presentation was great; they had beautiful sliced fruit served as accents to the sushi, and the sushi itself was really good. Definitely recommend this place for a casual, cheaper end sushi night (that's still delicious!)"

/user_details?userid=QLowLrxFk4roOZ4eZNfU9w,Jules S.,"Walkerville, Windsor, Canada",5 star rating,"Cozy little hidden gem on St Denis. Sushi was fantastic! Service was super friendly. My daughter had the California roll and avocado roll, I had the Volcano roll and we shared a Philadelphia roll. We loved all of them! The volcano was particularly good ... crispy on the outside, delicious dipping sauce and it was huge! Highly recommend."

/user_details?userid=X8AVH82124dE-jwPFXcg8A,Lianna N.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"I had the scallop sashimi, Exotica and Niko rolls, sashimi size was fresh and both rolls were filled with tons of seafood and were large in size.  Service was fast and efficient and the owners were very personable.  The area is great for drinks after if you're looking for a quaint and chill bar."
