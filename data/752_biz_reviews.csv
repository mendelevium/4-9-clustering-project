Hence I wanted to try Diolo  Traiteur which offers a variety of West African dishes especially Senegalese ones. I am Senegalese and was in a position to judge whether the food was good and authentic compared to what we have in Senegal. And I was not disappointed at all. The food tasted amazing. I could find all the flavors and tastes I was used to seventeen years ago. Edmond the chef and owner of the restaurant is such a friendly guy and really took care of ourselves, giving us a full description of the dishes we ordered and counseling us as well. Edmond you should open something in Toronto. All the best"

I was told this is Senegal cuisine and not African (similair, not the same alright ?) While I was seating, the waitress let me know what drinks they had and I got myself a ginger juice pour over a wine glass. My dish is the Yassa chicken served with plantains (extra), a couple of legumes on rice (one of the many choices) and with a yassat sauce. The meal was delicious although, I am not sure what to do with the rest of the yassat sauce during the meal. I applaud the service of this place. It was a little pricey but well worth it."

It was Sunday evening before Thanksgiving and the restaurant was very quiet when we arrived at 7:00 pm. Edmond the proprietor was very warm and welcoming. As the restaurant did not serve alcohol- we brought our own beer- and were graciously provided two very nice glasses and a bottle opener.We let Edmond choose our food as we have had very little experience with West African cuisine and wanted to eat what he thought to be the very best dishes from Le Senegal.He selected the grilled fish with couscous for me, and the braised lamb with caramelized onion and brown rice for my boyfriend. He also provided us a side of the Mafe sauce (a rich savory peanut sauce) to try and made on the spot a delicious hot sauce to satisfy out Texan need for hot spice.The grilled fish was terrific. It came whole with a type of mango salsa topping. It was fresh and very tasty. The cassava couscous (which I have learned is called Attieke) was out of this world good with a rich garlic and citrus flavor and unique and intriguing texture.The lamb shank was also delicious. Rich and hearty, the sauce had a braised onion and meaty depth that was delightful. The brown rice was not ""brown rice' per se- but more rice tossed with a pan drippings and molasses. It was not sweet, nor sticky, but rather well rounded and a wonderful accompaniment to the lamb.The Mafe sauce was killer good. Though Edmond did not recommend this for a dinner item, owing to the dishes inherent heaviness on the belly. So if you go for lunch give it a try!All in all a excellent experience with an exemplary host and exciting and exotic food. Tip: skip the apps and just go for the entrees and you will not be disappointed."

/user_details?userid=x8EBl4H1cjX9rAJ-Oc0rEw,Venessa K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"I am married to a Senegalese and travel to Senegal quite often so I am in a good position to review this food.  From the onset of communication, the owner was beyond friendly.  He really went out of the way to make us comfortable.  The food was delicious but I would say that it was prepared in a healthier manner than typical Senegalese food. Senegalese food is the most delicious I have ever tasted but tends to be cooked with excessive oil.  This was not full of oil but somehow managed to hold on to its taste.  I can say it was not exactly the same since it was made with more healthy ingredients but I can say that the trade off was well worth it and the food held on to as much as the authentic taste as possible.  If you want authentic Senegalese taste with a healthy spin, this is your place. The one suggestion I could make would be to offer bread while your customers wait for their food and to serve larger portions of juice in a more professional looking container.  100% will return here if I ever visit this city again."
