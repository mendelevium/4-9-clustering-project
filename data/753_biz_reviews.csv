It was one of the best meals we enjoyed during our stay in Montreal. I had the carbonara with duck and it was rich and delicious.... the duck was crisp and there was bacon and green peas as well. My husband has the crispy chicken with broccoli it cane over the most delicious Caesar dressing/sauce ... it was creamy, flavorful and the chicken was perfect. My mom has the mussels and fries ... the salude was fantastic, creamy and flavorful I could have it as soup! Don't skip the key lime pie ... it's super good, and I'm from Florida so I know!"

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for a brunch book club meet, the resto is closely located by Barley. Cozy is the word for Non Vivant- but on a winter's day, it's more compact. Originally placed in a booth for a party of 6-I requested the table next to the bar for more space, no hesitations but smiles and the server guided me to the new table. (The downside of this spot, it is immediately in front of the main doors- so you get a draft).As I settled in for the others to join, I ordered a chai latté that was a solid cup of goodness. Following which I had the the huevos rancheros as my main dish for 17$. This dish was served piping hot on a iron cast skillet with layers of potatoes , cheese & salsa, chorizo, avocado and perfectly cooked eggs. A bit heavy on the potatoes but I still felt the meal was worth it. Service was good and quick. I've heard great things about the dinner menu- due to check out."

They don't take reservations but get there as soon as it opens and it won't be a problem. Great service, they were not bothered by our modifications for various dietary restrictions. Amazing food that's not your typical breakfast eggs, sausage and potatoes and amazing mimosas. Not to mention very affordable. They're just missing a terrasse but they open all their doors and floor to ceiling windows so it almost feels like there is one!"

Thankfully, they still served food.The restaurant looks like pub with funky and dimmed light. The service is impeccable. Our waitress is friendly, smiley and helpful. My friend got a broccolini salad, which looked lovely and he found it delicious that he even ask for the recipe. Obviously, he didn't get it. Lol . I took a whiskey drink, which is delicious. The atmosphere of the restaurant was vibrant. The music in the background was fun filling by Michael Jackson, Gloria Gaynor... and more of the classic. I throughly enjoyed my evening in the restaurant. Recommended!"

He had raved about it several times and we decided spur of the moment while we were at the Lion to book a table at Bon Vivant for an hour later (booked at 6pm for 7pm on a Thursday evening). The place is quite tiny so I do recommend making a reservation, it was full by the time we left at 9ish. Service was amazing (and the staff are damnnnn fine to look at), the food was 4.5/5* perfection (the cornish hen was stuffed with Tourtière which sounded insatiable but the execution was not quite as tantalizing, the hen was a bit dry and there wasn't enough stuffing).

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh yum yum yum! We literally left this place five minutes ago and here I am writing a review so that I make sure that I don't forget anything!We made a last minute decision today (Sat night) to go out for dinner and after seeing the good reviews, I called to see if we could get a table. The person who spoke to me on the phone was super flexible and said he'd make it happen. 40 minutes later we were seated at this cool industrial looking restaurant. The restaurant itself is super cozy (holds about 30-40 people max) and has a fun open kitchen where you can watch everything being prepared.We asked for some appetizer recommendations and were instructed (really.. it was pretty amusing) to take the fried cauliflower/Brussels sprouts/halloumi dish as well as the short ribs. Because our server was very confident about these two, we obliged and I'm glad we did! The cauliflower dish was super interesting and the ribs were to die for.For our mains, we ordered the rabbit (special of the day) and the cavatelli with burrata. Hubby liked the rabbit but said it wasn't outstanding, and the cavatelli was soooooo yummy like you wouldn't believe. Bathed in a delicious rosé sauce with onions and pancetta, this dish is smothered with melted burrata topped with a home made garlic pesto sauce. Need I say more? :pAt the end, despite us being pretty full, we decided to share a dessert and ended up with the key lime pie which was superb!Overall, 4.75 stars (.25 off for the rabbit dish). Service is excellent, food is outstanding, and prices are ok ($140 for all the above plus two glasses of wine). Can't wait to be back!!"

Intimate spot and the food was awesome. Start with a cocktail, try the wine but do not miss out on the octopus. This place is now on my list Of go to in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=5B5VU6-wA0ooGYJp1nNNEA,Richard B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Trust me, this place is amazing. Yakuza fries are considered as snacks? When the bucket of kimchi, fries and cheese landed on the table I expected half of the buckle to be hollow. You know when you get a sad ice cream and the bottom half of the cone doesn't contain anything? This isn't the case for the Yakuza fries. The whole bucket is full of perfect Netflix snack all the way to the bottom. What a great start!That was good but what about their recommendation of grilled octopus? Smoky and perfectly tender - one of the best I've ever had. It doesn't stop there. That gaspor bacon burger... I want a framed picture of it on the wall of my room. Everytime I order a burger in a restaurant it always end up as a disappointment. That's speaking for even the good burger places ranked high on Yelp. The quality for price ratio is always low until I was hit by the unexpected. Le Bon Vivant holds the human version of Krabby Patty. Go there to try it for yourself -  I won't spoil anything. The food quality is gold. That burger makes me high. No lie."

/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Good spot for a casual night out. Ambiance is laid back and focused on conviviality. The menu is quite varied and has hints of Asian flair with items such as Korean ribs, Kimchee salads as well as more classic Italian dishes. We stuck more with the Italian side for our evening. The major plus side of this place is that portions are huge! We ordered the antipasti appetizer and we're blown away at the size of burrata we were served! Not the best burrata we've ever had but it definitely hit the spot when the cream oozed out of the mozzarella exterior! Mains were also extremely generous is portions. However, lacked flavour. I ordered the veal oscobucco and was a bit disappointed as the meat itself was engulfed by the massive amount of sauce and potatoes it bathed in. The veal was decent when I dug it out of the potatoes but wasn't anything special. My boyfriend ordered the chicken jerk style and was disappointed in the lack of jerk seasoning. It was quite soft on the Caribbean flair, but the cool of the chicken was spot on. Overall, a very enjoyable evening. Tip: If you are two, sit in front of the bar facing the kitchen as you'll get to enjoy watching the chefs create their copious dishes while being closer to your date ;)"

/user_details?userid=GdTrpy62c_eI7DmP9DOq5A,Lionel L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"T'was a frigid cold Canadian winter with double digits freezing ass temperatures. My stomach was rumbling with calls of despair and therefore guided me to this place. Obviously lots of other stomachs felt the same so we did have to wait a bit for a spot. No worries. Once seated, at the bar, right in front of the open kitchen, you're automatically drawn by the dishes prepared by the chefs.I opted for the Huevos rancheros on cast iron served wth Papas Bravas, chorizo, avocados, chipotle salsa & corn tortillas. Cool winter comfort food, tasty and quite satisfactory but I did envy the Croque Madame plate more...For ""desert"" I had the French Toast. An evil Brioche bread with Grand Marnier flambé fruits, condensed milk & whipped cream. Although the inside consistency did almost feel like a 'flanc' at times, the flambé fruits were simply fantastic.I will definitely be back to try countless other things that looked wonderful."

/user_details?userid=eoHmSfOX6LgsP8fo4dCLiw,Atessa A.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Bon vivant is the kind of place you walk in and feel immediately welcome. It's a small restaurant with lots of charms from the very cool decor to the smiles and service given by the staff topped off by delicious plates.  We came to brunch and this I exactly the kind of setting I appreciate with open concept kitchen and hip music playing just the right level.  The service was very attentionate and the waitress did a really good job at describing the daily specials and making my mouth water. I had the croque madame,  one of their daily specials and it was absolutely divine.  The brioche bread they used,  the high quality ham,  the special béchamel Brie sauce,  every bite was a delight and the salad that came with it was a perfect addition. We also shared the French toast and this one comes in my top two of French toasts ever tried.  With its grand marnier flambé fruits and perfect balance of sweet and mushy,  it's a must have!I will definitely be back to enjoy more of the delicious plates coming out of that kitchen and the pleasant atmosphere in which we were welcome."
/user_details?userid=bJWOYt_12QI2PKUBReigtQ,Andreas P.,"Unionville, Canada",4 star rating,"First a note: I'm giving this place four stars because I need to leave room for an extra star just in case I come across somewhere that is truly amazing. That being said, Bon Vivant is well deserving of its four stars. We went there for late Sunday brunch and ordered the huevos rancheros and one of the specials - a meatloaf slice in a half bagel with tomato and greens on top. Both were well made, very tasty and a good blend of flavours in each. A couple of coffees rounded off the meal. The restaurant itself is small which lends itself to a bustling atmosphere even when it isn't packed. The staff is friendly and attentive. The brunch menu is not the most varied you're ever going to see but for me I'd prefer restaurants that make a few things really well rather than many things poorly. We're definitely going to come back to see what else they can create out of their tiny kitchen."
/user_details?userid=cBzgX2goaszfb1frp_S5ag,Eric R.,"Dorval, Canada",4 star rating,"First off, you NEED to make a reservation either directly calling them or by online. The place is noticeably small and although we reserved for two our table was in the way of the entrance in which we were offered to be relocated at the kitchen counter /bar. Because it was cold near entrance, we accepted. The food is pretty good. We started off with the assorted charcuterie accompanied by a beet salad. Portions are good for 2, even three. The charcuterie was pretty good which included in-house curated prosciutto aged 1 year. I hear that was their best entree so we went for it. Solid variety and well worth it. Main meals wise, I ordered the tandoori chicken on quinoa garnish. One thigh and two thick chicken legs. Plenty of food but my only complaint was that it was cold as if it had been waiting. My companion went with the Colcannon and looked delicious. Both plates are can't miss. Overall, will go back. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff!"

Don't go there if you want poor service! ) we ended up at bon vivant for brunch. Service was very courteous. They seemed to be busier than usual (it was thanksgiving monday) so our waiter apologized for any delay with the food and even offered us our first order of coffee (and they were all specialized coffee like lattes and cappuccinos). Overall the food was good. It was brunch so eggs and croissant, hard to miss but good portions. All in all I'd go back to try it for lunch or dinner for sure.  Nice décor as well and looks like they have a cute terrasse for those nice summer days."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The only issue is that the portions are on the smaller side and if you are hungry, you will definitely want to order an appetizer, main course and dessert. We tried their cauliflower and haloumi appetizer, kalbi ribs and octopus mains and creme brulee. All were cooked to perfection! I really wish that my kalbi ribs came with a small bowl of white rice and kimchi on the side!I would happily return to eat with friends again."

/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just returned from outstanding brunch at BV. Started with 2 lattes, very tall, very good. Sister had huevos rancheros, a huge (burning hot!) cast iron skillet filled to the rim with eggs, spicy chorizo, potatoes, zesty tomato salsa, tortillas & guac on the side. My winning dish was on their off menu specials, a croissant split in 2 covered with cheese, topped with melt in your mouth pork belly & 2 perfectly fried eggs with runny yolks. The side salad of mesclun salad with nice vinaigrette really did cut the richness of the egg/pork/cheese/croissant. Service was excellent, our waiter was so nice & all the staff were friendly. Highly recommend this fun restaurant."

We looked at the menu several times as all the choices sounded delicious and finally we ended up choosing the specials: Bahn Minh and clams. The dishes were entree size but they were to die for. The banh minh came with a salad while the clams cmae with 2 thick toasts. It filled us up quite quickly. The service was friendly and efficient. The maitre d'hote (maybe he was the owner) quickly found us a spot where to seat as we hadnt made a reservation. Our waiter knowledge and attentiveness was highly appreciated. We will for sure go back to taste more dishes.

/user_details?userid=ZkpNHYyPVmw1_zihmPGtIA,Uncle J.,"Portland, ME",4 star rating,"I can't comment on dinner, but we had a great lunch here during our trip to Montreal. We grabbed a couple seats at the bar towards the back end of the restaurant, which ended up being quite close to the open kitchen. Hopefully the chef doesn't get annoyed when people sit there, but we had a fun time watching him work his magic. We kept changing our mind on what to order as things appeared from the kitchen, all looking incredible.That's how we arrived at the bacon burger, which mind you, is stacked with much more than that and was superb. We also had the polenta and meatballs, which were also outstanding and some sort of salad that's faded from memory with all the meat we ate. What I am still dreaming about however, is the Chou-Fleur Frit. Fried brussels? Almost always great, fried cauliflower the same, but those two combined with fried halloumi in a bed of yogurt and hummus?? The best. If I'm being honest, I could just eat the fried halloumi with the various dippings forever, but it was nicely balanced with the vegetables. Our waiter/server/just all around personable guy Alesandro (think I have that correct) was top notch as well. Excellent detail about anything on the menu, happy to chat with us about Montreal (on our first day in town). I hear that Montreal is a service industry down and the standard is high, but even if that is the case, Alesandro was above and beyond. A cozy, delicious place for lunch and we would certainly return if in Montreal again. Well worth your time."
/user_details?userid=UirqnjnmN1CLusITMx7Dhw,Dyson L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Overpriced brunch.  My friend ordered the huevos rancheros, while I had the special which consisted of two unfolded crispy tacos sandwiching a meager quantity of scrambled eggs, guacamole, beans and a few slices of chorizos sausage, which sauce on top. The rancheros was served in a skillet pan that seemed smaller than on pictures. My friend was treasure hunting for some chorizos. ""You sure it was supposed to come with chorizos?"" I asked -- we could only see potatoes. $15 for that?  Mine was $16.  We would gladly pay more for unique and original brunch. This is not it -- these are basically cheap Mexican food but priced as if in a tourists trap. Plus very ordinary coffee for $2.50, which would have been free, with refills, at other brunch places (and we've been to most brunch places in Montreal). Two stars for the taste, and one for the okay service.  It was Sunday at noon and it wasn't busy.  Maybe this place is better for dinner and drinks and for people seeking the hip and cool factor."

Dinner had a different vibe: dimly lit, cozy. Our server was attentive, patient, & warm. We listened to her recommendations for food & they did not disappoint. 2 of us shared the dumplings appetizer, the cauliflower appetizer, and the lamb shank. The cauliflower is a must; its flavorful & zesty, ive had fried cauliflower & fried haloumi before but theirs is unique. The lamb shank was cooked perfectly it was well seasoned, tender, & juicy. We each had a glass of wine. Our total was about $90. For Montreal, id say its a bit high but the food was delicious & i would definitely come back!"

Is there a wizard casting delicious patronum spells in the kitchen? Do they use enchanted meats? This place boggles the mind.  This is what I ate.

/user_details?userid=W1r_8isQxEqht9zkUy_ahQ,O M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"While wandering around for a early dinner after a day of travel we stumbled upon Bon Vivant. The place was still empty as they prepared for the dinner service.  Service was quick and attentive by the hostess and chef (who were on duty at the time). Dinner options were well explained and some good suggestion to suit my wife's preferences.The kale salad we started with was fresh with a variety of complementary flavours. Only discovered this as we were half way though since there was far too much lemon on top of the salad, still enjoyable nonetheless.The mains were far more consistent. I had the BBQ ribs with polenta and cabbage, healthy portions served on a stone slab. The light kick offered up by BBQ sauce was well balanced by the sides. My wife had a goat ragu served in a seasonal squash.  It was well presented and the flavours were excellent. Overall quite an enjoyable meal.The decor of the place was I guess what you could call industrial, lots of steel and wood surfaces.  The lighting was somewhat dim which gives a nice warm feeling to the space. Music was great but can't comment on the atmosphere since we were the only ones there at the time. 4.5 if I could."
/user_details?userid=Ycp7BP1hKgN4zfmNpPwqJQ,Shanshan Z.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Muh... the store is very small and we were accommodated at two seats right by the washroom... the food was okay but not much comment on the service. We got ribs as starter and two entree and two chocolaty dessert. Two entrees were salmon and duck leg. Total was around 130. The duck leg and the starter was overcooked and part of it was black. The salmon I thought is cooked and ended up as a sashimi. The dessert was good and looked nice. Considering the overall price I'd say there must be better alternatives.

The food is so packed with flavor , came here by fluke and the owner Sebastian was beyond generous with his service and knowledge with a zest of life. The food-like wow wow wow, definitely would travel over seas to come here again the steak. The wine, desert. Like I'm salivating"

While some plates are unspectacular, the diversity in the menu means you wont have trouble finding a delicious option. Recommended!"

The service was average, not good not bad.Finally the food was tasty though I found was heavy, there were no vegetables or fruit that would have made it more balanced. In summary, instead of coming back, I rather prefer to experiment with other places."

Very thankful as we were starving. Everything we had was very delicious and unique. Ordered the Brussel sprouts, mussels, and octopus. Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. We saved room for dessert and very glad we did as the apple crumble was excellent. All around great food, service, and atmosphere."
/user_details?userid=MMKknEw3lR1hZ1-SpORFHw,Diana L.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,Everything was good but not great. The service was friendly and fast enough. The flavours were quite nice - we got fermier salad the Korean short ribs the tataki tuna and fish and chips. So why 3 stars? The quality of meat and fish were poor. The Korean short rib meat was the same cheap beef you'd expect to find in a fast food food court Asian restaurant. Dry and grisly. Even the part with fat attached to the bone was terribly chewy. The tuna although fresh was rubbery near the cooked exterior and far from melt in your mouth. I ordered the pinky as it was a house cocktail and it wasn't bad but wasn't exceptional either. The sauce and presentation were excellent. I'd be willing to pay 5-10$ more for my plate to have quality melt in your mouth meat and fish. Loved the decor- the lighting was lovely.

That's one plus among many about this delightful restaurant. A fairly good selection of wines by the glass to accompany our delicious food. We chose from the daily specials. Shared a superb appetizer of burrata, thin crisp aspargus spears, sitting on a bed of lovely Italian cured ham. Followed that with cavatelli with mushrooms, very good. My husband really enjoyed his vegetarian lasagna with Oka cheese - different and flavourful.  Portion size is reasonable, the vibe is hip, music is good and though lively, not too noisy that you can't have a conversation."

/user_details?userid=hxlwUmM34QZXnybOJg-X3g,Joshua G.,"Larchmont, NY",1 star rating,"Food was expensive but fair for the ingredients, not quite for taste, which was sub par (we got an octopus dish, and a clam and muscles pizza). My main problem however was the tatted manager (or something similar, maybe the owner?) with the sleeves constantly harassing the female employees, rubbing their backs during conversation, and at one point sliding his hand over an employee's elbow. Very off putting, unprofessional, and kind of a gross vibe to see during a meal."

/user_details?userid=X3nRtVpJ855MCRM9pcpnmg,Andy G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My partner and I visited one Sunday morning for a late brunch. Side-eyeing the dull sandwiches and salads at the table adjacent, he and I opted for the huevos rancheros and roast beef poutine, respectively. My poutine was quite the disappointment, with a gravy that was somehow underseasoned yet far too thick, and flecks of house-roasted beef too obscure to be appreciated. My partner's huevos rancheros fared no better, with pools of grease nestled into a tomato sauce that lacked any nuance beyond the mild heat from Mexican chili powder. Perhaps the most glaring fault of the dish, however, were the uncooked egg whites he discovered at the bottom of his EGG-based dish. This was surprising given that both dishes took what felt like an eternity to arrive, so you'd think they would've used more of that time to cook their eggs all the way through. Now, I recognize brunch is generally an ill-fated meal, but I still don't think that's much of an excuse for a business to underperform. Sorry to say this was another one of those restos that seems to value style or service."
/user_details?userid=Eua6PMlCQZX_JgPZpZEg1g,Carina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great menu, almost always great service except for sometimes but it's rare. Food's always on time but to get someone to come around isn't always easy once you get your meal so make sure you ask for whatever you need at the beginning. Otherwise love this spot. Highly recommended. Dates, lunch, brunch, dinner, meal with friends. Worth the money."
/user_details?userid=FXBMAWJvEYCUHJHyWPY3yA,Max K.,"Lake Zurich, IL",4 star rating,"Went for brunch with a couple friends. First walking in the place is really cool with the raw wood, iron, and Edison bulb vibe going on. We sat up at the kitchen bar which is always the best in my opinion to watch the cook. We got the berry and green smoothies, nothing special, basic smoothie you can make at home. I went with the benie BLT, eggs Benedict with bacon, tomato, turkey. It was one of the best Benedict's I've had. They smoke their own meats so the turkey and bacon had the right amount of smoke, not to over powering. Poached egg done perfectly, which sounds like a given but you'd be surprised at how many places do it so poorly. The hollandaise was classic, nothing crazy, done right. The other two guy got a basic eggs, bacon, potato dish and the club, they said they were really good, especially the potatoes. Everything else we saw coming out of the kitchen looked great. Didn't get any mimosas or bloody's but they all sounded good.  Overall, solid place for brunch."
