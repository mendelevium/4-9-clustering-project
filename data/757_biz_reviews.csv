I visited for the first time on Friday evening and was greeted by the co-owner and chef, Michel. The other co-owner's mom was also there, the restaurant manager is the childhood best friend of one of the co-owners and many of the waiters are part of the same dance crew. It's warm welcoming and the perfect place to unwind on a Friday evening.The restaurant is small and intimate. The walls are painted a warm red/orange colour, which makes it feel really cozy. Now, to the food. Between my brothers, my partner and I, we ordered 10 dishes (pictures for most dishes are attached). Though everything was delicious, my top picks are the Beef Carpaccio, Fried Ribs and the Mac + Cheese Ramen. The Beef Carpaccio was the best that I've ever tasted - no questions asked. It came with a mix of fresh peppers, nuts and was marinated in a dark sweet + tangy sauce; It was served with plain rice cakes. The Fried ribs were perfectly tender + crispy and packed with loads of flavour. The Mac + Cheese Ramen was different. Definitely one the most creative dishes, I've come across. It had Chicken, Cheese curds, and lots of spice.I'm already planning my next trip back!"

Nicely decorated with tight back-ground music. The place was packaged with patrons on a busy Tuesday night! They must be doing something right!I tried their fried ribs, beef bahn mi sandwich and chicken wings. My favorite was by far was their fried ribs. They were so crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside!The Bahn Mi was alright, decent sized packaged with the goods... but a little light on the sauce. I wouldn't have it again. I read the reviews after visiting, I'd definitely would try the beef carpaccio.Crispy Chicken Wings were good, crunchy on the outside like I like it.Overall a very positive experience, I'll be back for sure."

This place has been around for a long time and it had been low key on my radar and I thought I knew what it was all about and turns out I had no idea. When I finally did make it here it was by fluke! I had a little friend lunch date planned, we pulled out Yelp and tried to go somewhere nearby but their hours were wrong and we were out of luck. So we walked a couple blocks down the street and tucked into La Belle Tonkinoise instead. And we discovered a sexy little sunken oasis of awesome. So cozy, and so cool, the walls are plastered with amazing old magazine images and ads, comfy little tables, sweet bar and lanterns, a feeling of little nooks, privacy, warmth, fun. The service is a sweet combination of the quick mama, kind of old school Vietnamese, cool lady, tough, easy to talk to, funny and the new generation, super friendly adult son stepping in to add a killer poutine and burger to the menu (with a Vietnamese twist of course) and some great cocktails.We had tasty lunch bowls, mine had heaps of veggies and super trendy marinated beef (veggie cheat day! ok, pregnant lady cheat week.) And my friend had a chicken dish that she seemed to really enjoy as well. This was an excellent lunch option because aside from being tasty, affordable and friendly it was also super quick to get served and get back to life and work. But I think the real fun here would be a late dinner, trying a bunch of dishes and drinks and enjoying the feeling of being tucked away from the world. I'll be back for sure."

The menu is innovative with a fusion of Tonkinese and Quebec fare. You can't go wrong at this place. Try the daily specials and also the drinks.

It's not much to look at, being in the basement on Jean Talon, but the service is friendly, prices are good (no lunch spand the food is well done. It's always a good sign when Vietnamese people regularly eat here. Fresh ingredients, good spring rolls."

/user_details?userid=k66Q0geMdiQiX41HdxS64w,Ana B.,"Abbotsford, Canada",1 star rating,"Don't come here. Overpriced, soup was way too salty, microwaved beef sautée and super bland. Server didn't seem to care about anything and took over 10 minutes to come take our order after we were ready because she was chatting with a friend."
