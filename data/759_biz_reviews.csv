/user_details?userid=3qbfQWn8rPgkCovnGUz-qg,Elizabeth L.,"Burnaby, Canada",4 star rating,The Montréal restaurant was near the jean-talon market. Very big portion! Taste good and well flavored. Many kinds of roasted meats. I was quite full and satisfied after lunch.
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I can't believe I never reviewed this place.This is a place that can be good and bad at the same time.The good: the grimy grungy atmosphere and ambiance (believe me) people coming here seem very at ease whereas they might feel out of place elsewhere. The food is the type you eat before, during or after a drinking binge. It's an old style cantine that I hope does not disappear anytime soon to be replaced by a generic chain.The bad: it may very well be the un-healthiest food on the island, only thing missing to bring them over the top would be pizza.The service is hit and miss, sometimes friendly but other times cold.Last time I was there, I was standing for 10 minutes being ignored by the cook when he finally asked what I wanted.I wanted a souvlaki plate and he now tells me it takes 10 minutes to prepare, had he asked me earlier the food would have been ready.I know he's busy but asking quickly from whoever is waiting could help with the lineup, he could have just taken out the extra skewers and put them in the grill next to the others.The plate looks good but it's definitely not as tasty as real Greek food. The gyros sandwiches and hot dogs are the best options with fries coming in a close third.They stay open pretty late so it's only then that I go, daytime normally has better options"
/user_details?userid=JPMmBtmdVStt15en9SjLDg,Ryan F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,my go-to is the #1 combo of doner + fries + drink. the french fries here are probably the best in Montreal. no joke. get a side of mayo and you're set. this is a real local joint for the heads! cash only but there's an ATM so whatever.
/user_details?userid=jQIrbUo-x0VxzqefNPQonQ,G I N.,"Shelby Charter Township, MI",1 star rating,"La Ligne Rouge is a cafeteria style place for Greek Food. Located just outside of Jean Talon Metro station.There is ample street parking, I was passing by and it was dinner time, so decided to stop in for a quick bite. The place is a mom n pop shop, I wasn't really in the mood for Greek, but they served donnair, so I decided to give that a try. Of course, I also had to get a side of pouting, I was in Montreal after all. I ended up ordering a #7 & #12. Two donnair and a poutine combo.The donnair was disappointing. It lacked flavour and sauce was sub par. It was greasy, but not in the way that would merit the title of a greasy spoon joint. The meat was lacking and the proportion of meat to vegetable was Way off. The vegetables were decent though, the tomatoes not too ripe, the onions were raw and spicy and way too many. And this is coming from a guy that loves onions! 2 stars.The poutine fared no better. The combo came with a Tony drink, maybe 240ml (8oz) which was already a stingy sign. But the worse of it was probably the poutine. It did keep the theme of lacking flavour, I was able to taste the starch in their Brown sauce. The fries were old style chips, cooked in lard at a temperature too low so that they would absorb the grease. 1 star.There are plenty of other places in Montreal to get some late night good eats. The place gets 1,5 stars but since there are no halves, I'd have to round down and not up. In my opinion, La Ligne Rouge is exactly that, A Red Line, right through its name in my books...Yet another review where my opinion is not align with the masses. I've tried to describe the food as best I can so that you can decide for yourself whether or not this place is worthy of a visit."

Sadly, I was informed the gyro was not available when I requested it as they just put it on the rack... I opted for the souvlaki pita instead. As I waited, I read the newspaper at a nearby table. Some regular patrons came in and the staff was very friendly with them. They wanted the donner and they were told if they didn't mind waiting 10 minutes for it to be ready. They didn't mind. I wasn't told of this when I placed my order...About a minute or two later, I was informed that my food was ready. As they rung up the price (over $6 for only the sandwich??), he told me.... he actually made my donner sandwich after all. I looked at him with a blank stare before I walked out the store. I didn't wait to get to my car and went to eat my donner sandwich across the street. It was very average and lacked that slight dryness you'd expect from a well prepared gyro. It clearly needed time and I feel they just gave me whatever.... I'd expect better the next time around... if there's one... Lots of competition around those parts."

The poutine viande has roasted pork and is absolutely delicious. Addictive. The regular fries are amazing, homemade and classic. Our family loves la ligne rouge!"

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"If what you need is a late night poutine with meat from a spit shaved on to it, just to put poutine over the edge and beyond, than this is the place. Don't look too closely at anything inside except the hand-painted portrait of the owner with his manly mullet on the window. Don't question your life choices too much as the midnight gravy hits your gut (and thighs.) Just enjoy the Double Red Line ride."
/user_details?userid=vGohRKrqPgCJak3Jp6nGMA,Thalya L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The Mullets!!! The old decor, threw me off the 1st time i stepped  into the place. But the food was good enough for me to loose focus of my surroundings. They close late which is a bonus! Staff was very friendly! The poutine was amazing, it was so much food and it hit the spot instantly! As for the chicken souvlaki humm, a bit soggy and bland. Ill try a doner next time. This place is convenient if you live in the villeray/ jean talon area and its affordable! I wouldn't sit down and eat there but that the clean freak in me , but I suggest you take it to go! The poutines are definitely worth going for!"
/user_details?userid=wNgCoH8qlfTxAV_z11wGYQ,Adam V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've lived in the jean talon area for the last two years and have always been curious to eat at this restaurant. I waited two years too long. This is going to be my new go to place when I want some cheap greasy food! It was so yummy and filling!! I had just a good old double cheeseburger and fries and my friend had a chicken burger that is actually made out of real chicken pieces with a garlic mayo and a poutine!!! So satisfying! I highly highly recommend :D
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's official, La ligne Rouge has officially earned the last star! I've been here almost every week when im in town and it get's better every time. I love that the food is consistent and the service is great! I am a very harsh yelper and I rarely give restaurants a five star. The consistency of the food, the satisfied feeling you get after every bite and the sadness that overwhelms your soul when the food is finished is what determines a 5 star restaurant to me! Absolutely the BEST poutine, gyro and onion rings I've eaten in my life!"
/user_details?userid=KlMyEZKf_WWAVZ-_PYffaQ,Anita B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A friend recommended this small souvlaki diner just outside the Jean Talon metro, doesn't seem much at first glance, place is quite dingy but the food is out of this world, best donors possibly ever existed, and yes try their poutine with  meat, there is no disappointment coming here. Marathon takes a close 2nd"
/user_details?userid=Bt7vW5uLd6kGOy3qv41VHQ,Paulo T.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,I love this restaurant. Probably the best souvlakis I ever tried. The sauce they use is perfect and the meat is great. If you take the trio #1 the drink is small and the fries are not crunchy enough to my taste so I usually take the #7 for 2 souvlakis hehe if you like good fast-food this is your restaurant.
