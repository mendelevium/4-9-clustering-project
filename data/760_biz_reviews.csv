/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Came here on a date with my grilfriend.The food was really good and the terrace is beautiful.The best came first. The lentil soup was delicious. We each ate it with a bit of bread. It was such a delicious experience.Then came the chicken brochette with shrimps. It was so damn good and overflowing. Those diahes were big. Their side salad was also very good.The fried calamari were ok. A bit flavourless. I think that was the least fun part of the meal. Everything else was enjoyable and cozy. The service was very polite and considerate.I want to come here to have more of that soup and try other dishes.
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Came for a lunch date and was surprised to see it was actually pretty busy.It's a BYOW so that's always a positive thing.Service was a bit slow the waiter wasn't around it was hard to get a hold of him.Before we left we noticed that our food came with soup or dessert but he failed to mention that so we took the cake to go and had to pay $2 on top to take it with us and it was just a little square of something not very appetizing.Best part was our Pakilia which was a littlePlatter of mixed dips and veggies and feta.

Fried calamari app was a delicous starter. Went with the filet mignon and shrimp which was cooked to perfect with tons of flavor. Bacon was wrapped around the filet pieces which was a nice touch. Its byob/wine which is also very nice."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Traditionally decorated BYOW with fresh Mediterranean fare. Calamari were perfectly cooked and fresh bread was in abundance (I'm big on carbs). The steak with shrimp was standard, nice portion size however lightly spiced, could have used more OUMF on the meat but other than that it was a hit. Salmon wasn't anything fantastic, could have used a dill butter sauce or some other form of added flavor, but the actual cook (and even picture perfect grill marks) did not go unnoticed. Potatoes are salty but help round the lacking of other big flavors in the dish. Same goes for the salad which would be better off with less dressing. Overall a great place to grab fresh food for a decent price + added bonus of BYOW."

Our server even let us try a dessert for free in case we didn't like it since it was a very traditional Greek dessert. Only reason I'm giving 4/5 and not 5/5 is because the plating could be a bit better in relative to the price. The taste is there, but the plating is extremely simple"

/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",1 star rating,Lamb tasted fine.  Scallop was bland but serviceable taste wise. The mixed appetizer platter tasted below average.  The dolmas were super soggy and almost tasteless. 2.5 star food taste wise but my wife got sick and even my rather well fortified intestinal trek (I survived Indian and Thai street foods with no mishaps) complained.I also saw two things that suggested to me our experiences were not outliers.  Table next to us returned a soup and other diners left the soups almost untouched.  I also saw a few tables with no food at all and were just drinking wine and/or tea.I find the decor rather outdated and lazy but it seems to be a popular spot for local old people to gather for a chat.

I must tell you it's simply delicious. It gets busy after 18:00 and especially in summer when they open their terrace, sometimes you may have to wait to be seated, but trust me it's worth the wait. This restaurant is perfect for family dinners, romantic dates, dinners with friends, moreover, it's BYOB (bring your own bottle) and the prices are surprisingly low."

/user_details?userid=-GOyRXrxavzJ5W3axrPXMw,Mayte P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Traditional Greek ambiance and byow. Le Jardin has always been a staple of the St. Denis area. It's always packed and always full of people having a  good time. I always enjoy myself except this most recent visit. A large party of mostly women and people of the LGBTQ community were having a birthday celebration on the top floor and our waiter, who was serving them as well kept making remarks about the group to my party, not understanding them, and referring to himself as 'at least I'm normal'. I find this kind of talk about customers to be inappropriate and unprofessional. His attempt to chat and connect with customers was not appreciated in my books."

This was of course not true. Once the owner began serving us, things significantly improved!We enjoyed the spanokopita and tzatziki as appetizers. As others have said, there was no pita served with the tzatziki. I had the chicken brochette and shrimp dish. Everything was really well cooked and flavoured and, with rice, potatoes, and salad, there was lots of food! We stayed for quite a while to finish our wine and did not feel rushed. The restaurant was quite busy compared to the other greek place on Duluth, which is a good sign. Give it a try!"

/user_details?userid=tDRGH3nt9VtbuPqrACzNVQ,Daniel C.,"McLean, VA",4 star rating,"Reading the many reviews for this restaurant perhaps the owners of this place should thank the restaurant across the street for requiring reservations that would even make the Pope's secretary blush. Having said that this place proved to be a wonderful alternative despite my intimate familiarity with Greek food in Astoria, Queens. The decor and atmosphere adequately provides a mutually exclusive place for couples looking for a romantic meal and people with children looking for a family meal. Prompt service and seating were a plus. I noticed that it was a BYOB establishment and sometimes that makes the dining experience more comfortable because the interaction with the waiter takes out that long recitation of the wine menu. We had the chicken souvlaki and scallops. It has been a while since I have been to Canada but has salad been always included in meals? I don't complain since it negates the need to order a salad separately. My reference point for Greek/Cypriot food are the various restaurants in New York's Greek enclave so naturally we couldn't but help compare. The chicken was tender and not that block of tough meat that sometimes souvlaki can become. The portions were generous and the scallops were cooked just right. The sides added that perfect touch. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves, ate a wonderfully cooked meal and soaked in the ambiance (not everyday that I hear French spoken more thank Greek at a Greek restaurant). The owner added a nice touch by giving my daughter a piece of chocolate on our way out. Even if the place across the street has a table, this place is worth a visit in its own right."
/user_details?userid=DVOOF0Z627DyrZ4XKQbTgA,Jessica G.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,We visited this restaurant on our first night in Montréal and fell in love with it instantly. The terrace was beautiful--it was quite romantic in the evening! The staff were friendly and the food was delicious. I would strongly recommend the Shish Kebab. I was expecting an average dish since it's so common but it really surprised me!

So cool and relaxing on a summer day (or evening).  Food is traditional and flavourful but inexplicably, they don't serve pita.

I was not sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Several vegetarian options- we had the vegetarian plate and the halloumi brochettes- both were delicious, with great salad and amazing roast potatoes. My parents had the moussaka and domas- and both loved their meals. Great to be able to bring your own wine and sit on a beautiful terrasse. The staff were very attentive.

Great grilled brochettes. I ordered the filet mignons brochette and really liked it. Their spanakopita recipe is nice too. Their menu really isn't extensive however. Everything delivers and is tasty, but nothing really had a punch to it.Service : expect to wait before being seated, this place is quite popular. However, once seated, you are very well taken care of.Overall: definitely a go-to place."

/user_details?userid=eBbVMhxfO5Rgc3hNhVkSDg,Jilbert N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,What poor customer service! My girlfriend and I went on a double date and both ordered the Shish Kebab. Our waiter was prompt and courteous but when our food came we noticed it didn't look quite right. After cutting into it and confirming with the wait staff we realized that it was pork. I asked nicely to have our meals changed as we have dietary restrictions. I apologized for the confusion but argued with the owner/manager after she charged us for four meals when it is clear that shish kebab is usually beef or lamb. Owner was stubborn and not friendly. Will not be going back anytime soon!
/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Tasty,  but very salty! As a fan of Greek food, I'm often skeptical about Greek restaurants in Montreal. More often than not, the food focus more on quantity than quality, without much of an authentic flavour. La Jardin Panos was no exception, yet I was still impressed with it. The restaurant outside is a cute white old building which has touches of charm. The inside? Nothing to brag about. However their terrace is beautiful, while birds chirp quietly around you. I do recommend going mostly during the Spring/Summer time. Now the food.. Keep in mind the restaurant does NOT serve any alcohol beverage. You may bring you own. The menu has a lovely abundant of variety, but not much authenticity. Thinking of sharing a dish? Think twice as they charge you $5.00 to share. Thinking of bringing your own dessert, wait.. Who does that? Well if you do, that's $2.00 extra. We've ordered an appetizer along two main courses, which come with soup or salad, and dessert included. The appetizer was spanakopita. Very tasty, filled with generous amount of spinach, wrapped in a very tough, rubbery dough. Absolutely no crumbly or crusty factor. Main course was a Moussaka, which was a very generous and delicious portion. Served with oven baked potatoes and a salad with a salty dressing. I chose the leek soup to be part of the combo. I'm very convinced that either the chef never tasted it or simply used salt as the base of the soup. Which had no taste at all expect the harsh abundant taste of salt. As for the leeks.. I saw minimal traces of them. I simply couldn't finish the soup. Far too salty! Our waiter was just ""Ok"", till the end of our meal where he asked me no less than three times if I'm sure I wouldn't want a dessert. With a laughter attached to it. I don't find being pushy at all funny. I will think twice whether I'd want to go back."
/user_details?userid=w1ylNHvCXarz9sKMC93l-Q,D. H.,"South Windsor, CT",4 star rating,Just ate at Le Jardin de Panos with my family and I'm a fan.  The host was welcoming and our waiter was charming.  We had the filet mignon and lamb kabobs which were very good but could have used a little more searing. The kids menu was greatly priced (the best I've ever seen!) for the amount and quality of food.  The dessert were very good and the cappuccino was creamy and hot (which in my book is a good thing).  They do not serve liquor but you can go across the street and buy your own beer or wine to go with your meal.All in all it was a fun holiday experience and we look forward to visiting again when we're in town.

For starters, we had the dolmades which were covered in a rich, creamy lemon sauce- Superb!I had the lamb chops for my entree and my boyfriend had the filet mignon.  Both were perfectly cooked to order and delectably seasoned.For dessert, we shared the baklava and galaktoboureko.  Wow, SO rich and SO very good ( not to mention, they were only $2.95 each).Overall, a great experience!"

/user_details?userid=xp-5R1akrzPZZHwLMUMF5Q,Jessica S.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"We were seated on the terrace, even though it was pouring. If I am learning one thing about Montreal, it is the dedication to savoring the out of doors in the short window the city has. The terrace is covered and it works 97% well, we still got a few drops. But it was a nice atmosphere regardless. The service was fast and attentive and our waiter answered our questions well. The boyfriend ordered the shish kabob and I ordered the combination filet mignon and shrimp kabob. The meals came quickly and were more plentiful than I expected. They each come with a green salad, the kabob, rice, and potatoes. The meats were delicious on both plates. I was very impressed with the perfect tenderness of the shrimp. My fliet mignon was almost all medium, as I had ordered it, but one of the three pieces was a tough more done, but it did not ruin the flavor. It was so good that I ate until I was uncomfortably full."

No smoking even on the terrace.I enjoy the chicken brochette (kabob) which comes with roasted potatoes.We came in about 9:00 and the place was still packed.

Our first hiccup with the service was when we said we wanted to just order one appetizer and one main course between the two of us. The waiter started complaining and being really aggressive about how they have to give us twice as much ""free"" bread and all. He wanted us each to order at least one main course. After we ordered and we got our dishes he just stood there watching us until we finished. When we had to get the bill he completely ignored us. The food wasn't great either. I have had much better at other Greek places."
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time;) What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot."

I shared the platter and it was fairly decent, but nothing to write home about: it's cheap Greek food that does the job and provides a good base before you go rip it up somewhere else. The prices were right, the atmosphere if you can sit outside is fabulous and the staff were super accommodating as our group size kept changing."
/user_details?userid=sR2EMcrCZahvA8zOraeQnw,Rahul J.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"Most important thing to know here is: TAKE YOUR OWN WINE. They do not have any wine, or beer, or any sort of alcoholic beverage. So if you don't want to be washing down your amazing Quebecois/Greek cuisine with a diet sprite, buy a nice bottle and carry it with you. Also, the convenience store across the street has vinegar for wine and its dear.Next, there will be a line outside. It took me nearly an hour to get in, in the Montreal winter. Well worth it for a good meal.Right past that little hurdle, the food is amazing. Large hearty portions of whatever you order; I had the lamb and it was fantastic. The bread they serve it with is fresh and fluffy like a pastry, and the salad dressing - complimentary salad - was just the best dressing I've ever tried.So truth is I went here after I got turned away from Au Pied Couchon (across the street), which some people will claim is the best restaurant in Montreal and hence obviously requires reservations six years in advance (and don't try to claim you're from their courteous neighbour in the south, it makes things worse). Fantastic decision in the end."

JdP did not disappoint. Gourmet cuisine, it's not, but there is something to be said for being consistent. The first bight of souvlaki brochette was like a time warp to 15 yrs and 3 kids ago! Yes, the salad is overdressed but remained crunchy, lemony, and tasty, without reaching for the bottle of (Greek) salt on the table. The meat was cooked perfectly , the slices of onion slightly charred, mmm. The potatoes did not quite match the crisp outside I remembered, but oh well, I was quite willing to overlook that small detail on the otherwise delish plate.I would also add that kids are actually very well treated here, although few in number. The kids menu was an outstanding value, and my daughter is now a fan of lentil soup!Overall, not only did it not disappoint, but we made converts of the kids. The BYOW policy keeps it very well priced, and we'll be back during our next Montreal visit. The warm summer night was nothing to sneeze at either, and certainly added to our experience ;-)"

The place is still packed with lines out the door during peak times but I think that's just the remnants of its reputation. There are other BYOW places that are much better in the Duluth area. Jardin de Panos is not much better now than the generic BYOW Greek places around Prince Arthur that mainly cater to tourists.  To date their decline, they used to have an enormous terrace but apparently they had some noise complaints from neighbors so they had to cover about half of it.  This is the precise moment when the quality of the food went down, the portions shrank, and the prices started climbing.  It's a shame. The old Jardin de Panos was one of the best outdoor eating experiences in the city."
