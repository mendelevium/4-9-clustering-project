The staff was super friendly and covid precautions were well handled, we felt comfortable being there. the prices were reasonable for brunch (and they offer bottomless mimosas!) I ordered the avocado smoked salmon salad, really pretty plating and everything was super fresh and tasty and a mimosa that hit the spot."
/user_details?userid=gwmyGLz4eBm9QiBU_Ze2KQ,Katherine A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The vibe and aesthetic of this place is a vibe! The staff create such a welcoming environment. This restaurant has two floors with rustic/vintage decor.Note: $25/per person for bottomless Mimosas during brunch! I really enjoy the Chicken & Waffles (4/5)! The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with fluffy waffles complemented with syrup and blueberries. The wait for the food was a tad bit long, but that could of been because it was so busy. Was worth the wait! However, there is a minimal amount of selection on the menu for brunch: one-pager.I'd come back with a larger group of friends and make reservations next time!"
/user_details?userid=Ams0iLRd0AhZZectGKA8fw,Thanh N.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch before our big adventure. We were greeted right away and seated. Both weren't feeling so hungry so we shared a plate of pancakes and the boyfriend had his side plate of bacon. The pancakes were super fluffy and moist with the delicious lemon maple syrup, decorated with fresh berries and stuffed with ricotta cheese. I found the cheese was a little overwhelming but overall a good dish. Bottomless mimosa for $25 - we passed on it, because we were just starting our day.The vibe itself was very imitate with a front stage, bar filled with many spirits and friendly staff members. Overall a good experience."
/user_details?userid=DkvaAV7F4Y_rw040k0XGvQ,Wilma R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I had the avocado toast which comes with a little spring salad. I didn't think it would be enough but the egg and salad really end up filling you up. The flavours were spot on. We were seated in front of the bar and all the bartenders were really cool and laid back, nice to make conversation with. The place itself seems real swanky and hip. I'd suggest making reservations as they're pretty busy, especially around brunch."
/user_details?userid=Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here for their brunch/mimosa specials - all you can drink mimosas for $25.   This seems to be a pretty popular option for Sundays so if you really want to do this, make a reservation.Their brunch menu is small, but sometimes I prefer that b/c I don't like places with overwhelmingly amount of choices.  I had the smoked salmon with eggs/english muffin.  It was pretty good!  The decor is pretty nice and there is plenty of seats to accommodate a large group. There is also seating on the 2nd level.Our server was super friendly and always attentive!  He kept those mimosas topped up all during our brunch :)"

We were sitting in the back on the first floor and the stage was still visible from there. However, the tables were too close to one another and the drinks were way too expensive."
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,I hardly give a 5 but when I do it's because a business is amazing and the service too. I am a Vegan and they had very limited options for me. I was with a group so I had decided to stay and just have whatever I could find. The kitchen came out and said they would make something extra special for me. I have no idea what it was but it was super amazing !! They also have us great starters to try as well and free shooters. I loved the upstairs and the great seating. It is very busy on Sundays with their unlimited mimosa's but it's a great vibes and wonderful staff. There is street parking and in the lot outside. Great bathrooms and they also have live music throughout the week.

We were super hungry; we arrived at Rosewood for brunch.It's a beautiful two floors restaurant. The service was wonderful; our waitress always checked on us, by bringing water and making sure we were enjoying our food. Since we were from Yelp; there were complimentary dishes, like brioche with icing and topped with bacon and toasts with chicken pâté. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try them since I am a pescatarian. From the menu, I order poached egg, avocado and salmon toast with greens on the side. My food was delicious, except the salmon was slightly over cooked; the texture felt pasty. In the end, we received complimentary shots; that was good and fun. Great restaurant chosen by Mariko... thank you!"
/user_details?userid=FTzMI0AxPVpDdw-HpywWfQ,Anthony P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon Rosewood on my way out of Montreal & am very glad I did. The atmosphere upon walking in the door gave me a lasting impression that I had gotten lucky with my choice of my last Canadian meal. Beautifully designed, the Rosewood jumps at you as certainly a trendy brunch spot, and It delivered all the way through. The ambience was perfectly mixed between feng shui and modern/trendy. I owe a separate paragraph to the service and the staff, which was one of the best parts of our experience at Rosewood. Of the 5 employees that we had interacted with, each one was delightful and kept high standards to the dining experience they provided. Water constantly being refilled (as an avid water drinker, I could appreciate), general politeness, etc. Hats off to these guys & gals. Next and most importantly, the food. It was easily one of the best brunch meals I have consumed in my days. My wife and I ordered 2 entrees (steam&eggs & poutine) and devoured them both along with some fruits & sweets. If you are looking for a proper breakfast, Rosewood has what you're looking for , but make reservations if possible!"

I've been here for the latter a few months back, the food was good but I would say that the portion was a bit on the small side.We came back here recently for brunch with some Yelpers after an event and were seated upstairs. The staff is friendly and attentive. We were offered some snack while waiting for our food (bacon bits cinnamon rolls & chicken liver pâté) and it was quite good. The menu is short & sweet, nothing fancy but like I mentioned, it's casual. We got steak & eggs, egg benedict, avocado toasts and salmon toasts, etc and were offered a shot of Galliano & espresso which was yummy as well.It's a nice place to hang out w your friends.I would come back for an easy-going sunday brunch :)"
/user_details?userid=SZuxdORUn5-CRi2-9h-Idw,Eric G.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Girlfriend and I came here for brunch before exploding the city. The restaurant is very dark in decor with minimal lighting. A front deck area for performance and a bar decked out with what looks to be primo alcohol.We were greeted and seated by the door. We were offered bottomless mimosas but that would just be bad news bears. We declined politely and just asked for water. My girlfriend wanted everything off their menu but we decided to share the pancakes. It was fluffy and delicious with lemon maple syrup and ricotta cheese. I also ordered a side of bacon and my girlfriend decided to throw a fun fact in with it. Disclaimer: Did you know it increases your chances of cancer? She read it off UberFacts.Our server was amazing and very professional, especially dealing with entitled human beings."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,What a fun surprise that was! Walked in to live music and got a seat right in front with some comfy couches and pillows. I was greeted by a nice young female waitress who brought us the menus right away.I got the poutine Which was excellent huge chunky cold curds served with a special gravy that made normal poutines seem blaze. I got the Smokey old fashion which was out of this world. Check video :) I had a way better time here than Joverse as thatPlace turns in to a real bell hole after 9 pm. They own both these locations and I had a way better time here as I had to leave Joverse because they didn't place our orders and it was over crowded. So if you're in the neighbourhood check out this place especially if there's live music going on.
/user_details?userid=P5na1Eqyxp-tlf_eSt7a-g,Sara D.,"Wayne, NJ",5 star rating,"LOVED THIS PLACE. I was looking for a solid place to do a boozy brunch for my bachelorette party and Yelp did not disappoint with this recommendation. I made a reservation online and they confirmed via email the day before, which was so easy! We arrived and all elected to do the bottomless mimoas which was a bargain at $25 CAD each, especially considering that two drinks anywhere else would come out to the same amount. These were proper mimosas too! Not weak but not so strong that the champagne overpowered the orange juice! The meals we shared were all incredible the french toast and salmon avocado toast were to die for and oh my god, the brekkie poutine!!!! All of the other options on the menu sounds awesome too, so I'm hoping to be able to return to try those as well! The atmosphere there was so chill and the wait staff was so great that I could definitely see myself spending hours there!"
/user_details?userid=EZ6UWcHhiAPRp77V3pFMig,Mia T.,"Auburndale, MA",2 star rating,The ambience was good. The servers were (mostly) fine. The food was mediocre. The price was a bit high.I ordered the Cajun fried chicken and it arrived cold in certain areas and not crispy leading me to think that this restaurant reheats its food instead of serving freshly cooked dishes. I also have a suspicion that the restaurant discriminates against non-French speakers as the patron next to me received a much larger portion of the same dish I ordered.The waitstaff also made a big fuss at first over staying for the comedy show even though we had arrived 1.5-2 hours before the show would begin. Didn't seem very accommodating.
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Rosewood is, as much as I wanted to love it, nothing special. Came here for a big birthday brunch where the entire top floor was essentially booked for us and I was underwhelmed since before we sat down. The restaurant made zero effort to create any type of cohesive seating arrangement to accommodate our group so we broke up into tables of 2-6 depending on availability. Apart from that, the bottomless mimosas were super diluted meaning that we paid $25 per person essentially for juice. And finally, the food was seriously lacking in taste. We were four people at our table, each having ordered something different: chicken sandwich, steak and eggs, breakfast sandwich, and the smoked salmon plate yet we all found our food extremely bland with two from our table even returning their food barely touched..... Honestly, wouldn't come back. Service was meh, prices are meh, food is meh... tons of other great places in the city to eat at. Sorry Rosewood!!!"
/user_details?userid=_muhtS8ZFnV61s7Q4JXDwQ,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",3 star rating,"Montreal, specifically Old Montreal is full of awesome cocktail bars with cool scenes to go along with it. Rosewood was almost there, but not quite.The bar itself feels more like a pub, but they have some interesting cocktails that they throw together. I came on a Thursday evening and had one of their Smokey old fashioneds. They literally have an old school kettle that they use to create the smoke that mixes with the drink. It was unique tasting and made for quite a show. For that, they get props. The drink itself was just ok, but the effort that went into it was worth a star alone.There is an upstairs and downstairs section with a good amount of seating. People starting filing in around happy hour time and the place seems like it starts to get crowded around then. Overall I'd say this is a decent place to stop for a drink or two, but definitely not a final destination with so many amazing bars nearby. If you do come however, get a Smokey drink of some sort and enjoy something different."

The place was popping (bottomless mimosas and big groups), a little loud, but not unbearable. Cool downstairs and upstairs, lots of room. We both had the breakfast poutine which was killer. Bloody ceasars were great also, would recommend!"

Staff were all nice, plates were mostly well composed and balanced. Their basic egg/meat/toast dish was overpriced however I considered the other menu items to be a good value, particularly considering the location. Certainly planning on coming back for both brunch and a music night. It's very much a ""girls brunch date"" kind of place based on the crowd."

Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning without a reservation, and were seated immediately. Our table was literally on a stage, a nice addition to their edgy decor. They have a pretty diverse menu, with an option for $25 bottomless mimosas. I tried the seasonal pumpkin pancakes, which were sweet and delicious. Wish they were open on Mondays so I could've gone back and tried the breakfast poutine!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here with my girl friends on Wednesday night during MTL à Table. They were hosting a cocktail competition where we got to try two different cocktails for $12. Honestly I didn't like either of them. One was a gin cocktail but it tasted like Chinese medicine. The other was something similar to cranberry vodka. Nothing special. I also ordered a bloody Caesar that was better. For starters I had the crispy pork belly with cucumber, radish and shimiji mushrooms. It had a hoisin vinaigrette, chili caramel, micro coriander. This was $4 extra. It was just ok. I feel like i could get much better pork belly in Chinatown or elsewhere. Next I had the filet beef with Provençal butter, red wine sauce and roasted and steamed vegetables. This was also $4 extra. I felt like it was a bit dry. Lastly for dessert I had the brownie served warm with homemade vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The brownie was hard and cost $3 extra. Yes the MTL a table menu was $21 but everything I wanted to order cost more and it wasn't worth it. The food was really not memorable. I've definitely had better pork belly, beef and brownie elsewhere. I did not enjoy the cocktails.  I will not be back and I'm sorry to say that I do not recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=Ghz4jDFbi7ahGSdEJO_qTw,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Me and three girlfriends were exploring the city and arrived right when this place opened for brunch on Saturday. Even though it was empty, we were told we wouldn't be able to sit at a table as they were all booked for reservations - would it be okay if we sat at the bar? We were totally fine with this. The vibe of the restaurant was cool and the bottomless mimosas were pretty good. However the food wasn't great and our server was extremely rude. During the entire meal we felt like our server, the bartender Patrick, was annoyed with us. The other server we spoke with was friendlier but Patrick was not trying to interact with us at all. When the meal was finished, he came over to us and told us to leave because he needed the seats more than once in a five minute period right when the clock hit our two hour mark. 1. Had this been a reservation, we would have understood, but we were already seated at the unreserved bar. I get needing to stop the bottomless mimosas on time, but we were still finishing our last drinks and could have wanted to order and pay for additional drinks. 2. Had he asked even a little bit nicer, we probably wouldn't have been so offended. I wouldn't recommend."

When we called to make the reso, we specifically asked if it was possible to sit all of us on a table and they said yes and confirmed we'd be at one. Once we got there, they tried to split us between two tables, and when we asked why they said there wasn't even a table big enough. We go upstairs (which was open and people were there) and see one. They just didn't want us to sit there I guess? We go anyway.The waitress was on our floor but was soooo slow and refilling our mimosa glasses. We paid for bottomless! We couldn't get her attention for anything - not even for some salt. We barely got any mimosas.3 of us got the avocado toast and there was legit 2 pieces of thin little slices on each one.The only upside is that they gave my friend a really nice pudding dessert for her birthday, which was actually really good (better than the rest of the food lol).At the end, we saw on our bill that they had included an 18% tip. I always tip, but 18% is a pretty generous tip in montreal (where it's usually 15) especially for such shit service.I've heard bad service stories from different friends."
/user_details?userid=L21Zf-UthKbch8C2SonOaA,Simone M.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Came here for brunch during Montreal Restaurant week and had an absolute blast. We ordered the bottomless mimosas and our glasses were never empty for longer than 3 minutes, waiters came around with pitchers refilling glass after glass throughout our two hour meal, even though this restaurant was packed. The crowd was mostly young 20-somethings, and the vibe was definitely boozy brunch with college friends. Food was good and came out when we wanted it to. Soundtrack was awesome and fit the trendy feel of the whole restaurant. We ordered the bacon glazed sticky bun, yogurt parfait and huevos rancheros with ribs. Be aware that the huevos are non-traditional-- they were good but came deconstructed. Two smoked ribs on top of a baked tortilla chip with eggs topped with pico de gallo."

We didn't want to do the bottomless mimosas so after taking our food orders, our server brought us the cocktail menu and said he'd come back for our drink orders. Well, he never did. There wasn't even anyone around to flag down. Once our food was served, no one ever came back to our table to check on us. The food was mediocre, I had the fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken batter wasn't seasoned at all. The waffles were okay, but had obviously been sitting out for awhile and then reheated (based on their texture). The blueberry sauce was very good, not much caramel to be seen or tasted though. We have so many great brunch spots in Montreal, unfortunately this isn't one of them."

We went in on a recommendation but..... there was a band about to start and they sat us right next to the stage. We were forced to shove the food down our throats so that we wouldn't get blown away by the music. Food was terrific though. I highly recommend this place but go earlier in the evening in order to enjoy your meal.

Came for dinner, which was probably worth 3.5 stars on its own, but the ambience, service and house band (Superfly rocked!)  bring it up to a 5. It was like a fun party, with dancing and friendly people all around. The poutine was very good, as was the mixed salad with pumpkin seeds and light dressing. We also loved the popcorn shrimp with creamy sauce. Nothing too original, but it was good and just what we wanted. Also, the brownie with ice cream and brittle was huge and good for 3 people!  Overall a memorable and fun experience."

Though I called on Thursday to make a reservation, they didn't have it in their computer. However, they were super accommodating and still seated us.We got bottomless mimosas which were filled with generous ratios right at the table.  One of my friends had to go study after, so she only got one mimosa, which was $9, so it's definitely worth it to just get $25 bottomless.I ordered one of the daily specials, house-smoked salmon on multigrain bread with poached eggs, avocado and a bunch of other stuff. The avocados were a bit darkened, which I don't mind because I hate food waste, but avoid getting that if you're nitpicky about that type of stuff. Otherwise, the dish was absolutely divine.My friends who ordered the chicken and pancakes had to order extra syrup because there was not nearly enough.  The servers were a bit forgetful when we asked for extra syrup, but I can't really blame them because they were super busy refilling everyone's glasses while juggling their regular duties! I also wouldn't say it was understaffed because it definitely would have been too crowded with another server.Since it was my friend's birthday, we also got a complimentary dessert with a sparkler on top!Overall it was a great experience, and with the cheapest bottomless mimosas in town, I'll definitely be back!!"

Sadly, food doesn't follow the ambiance there. First of all, Rose & Goji berries lemonade was too sweet. I had a medium (way too small) Japanese Ceasar salad (Yuzu dressing) with tuna. Only five pieces of seared tuna. Not even fresh. It looks like it just came out of the fridge. Classic burger was small but ok. The only positive thing with this recent dining experience was the poutine gravy and the service. Staff was friendly. Overall portions are very small and food is SO expensive. Def overpriced. Considering the fact they just opened 3 months ago, I'm sure they can do better. I would recommend people to wait a while before trying that place but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it at all."

Instead of traditional hollandaise sauce, they use some clementine-infused sauce, which caused a zesty flavor and ruined the entire dish. Additionally, the smoked salmon in the dish was gross. Not fresh. Come here with friends for a drink or two [or three], but I'd opt out on the food."

Very limited items for brunch and sub par food. My friends whose bday it was had to send his breakfast as it arrived cold, under seasoned, and portions are small for the price you pay.

The service for this restaurant was terrible and I can't believe there are people like this working in the service industry. I found a piece of hair in my avocado toast and politely let the waiter know and he was quick to apologize and said he'll get me a new plate right away. Mind you, the hair was MIXED in with the mashed avocado. I put my knife and fork in and the hair came to surface immediately. A different server came back with a new plate and said that he searched all over the kitchen and there was no one with 8 inch dark hair in the kitchen, insinuating that it was my hair in the food (my hair was tied up in a tight ponytail by the way) He then said that I should be careful because he could've charged me for two plates. Then he had the audacity to tell me to calm down when he was the one that was being accusatory and raising his voice. A apology and new plate of food would've solved the problem - I think this is pretty standard if a restaurant messes up an food order. We notified the manager and he said sorry but we could tell he it was not genuine when he started making excuses for his staff.Giving this place a 1 star is generous."

Crowd was certainly bumping on a Thursday night, and I'm sure the $5 mojito special helped with that. It certainly helped me get through that basketball game at least...On the food side, we ordered the poutine to share. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but decent enough. Mojitos were great, if a bit on the weak side. The service was really friendly - this was a theme throughout our time in Montreal - and the poor server spent upwards of 20 minutes trying to find the channel that was broadcasting the game, never once making us feel like we were being a bother even though we definitely were. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it seems like a decent place to get the night started or to watch a game."
/user_details?userid=nOQlGpgqq2MBCuEzxLMm4g,Jenn G.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Terrible service and just eh, ok food. No wonder it was pretty much empty on a Sunday morning for brunch. I had the breakfast sandwich, which was disappointing. Way too much bread with measly fillings... one-egg omelet, 1 thin sausage split in half with cheese and standard toppings. It tasted fine, but nothing to write home about. A few of my friends had the salmon avocado toast and were also highly disappointed (ummmm... did you forget the avocado???)The service was slow. Granted, we were a big party, but also the restaurant was empty and there a manager and a waiter were both around. Rather than check on us to see we had our coffees and waters topped up and that everything was ok with the food, they thought it best to hang out by the kitchen and chat. Needless to say, we had to flag them down a few times.On top of that, we had a very unfortunate incident with the food and a member of the kitchen staff. He's obviously not fit for this industry if his ego is sorely bruised when someone sends back a dish for an unsanitary strand of hair in the meal. To accuse the customer of being the one to blame for it is beyond rude and unprofessional. Gordon Ramsey, you have your next kitchen nightmare.There is amazing food and service in Montreal. This place isn't it. Go somewhere else."

/user_details?userid=nCwA51oshPOj6foR--s0jw,Van D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1 star rating,"I'm not usually a huge fan of leaving negative comments through Yelp, but the experience at Rosewood left me speechless. First and foremost, the food was okay and presentation was pretty nice. It's a little pricey for what you get. However, we decided to come here because of other Yelp reviews....My friends and I took our girlfriend out for a nice bridal bunch. Everything was okay until my friend found a strand of hair embedded in her food. I don't blame her since I wouldn't want to eat food with hair in it. She kindly told the waiter about it and he willingly agreed to bring back a new plate. After the waiter took the plate away, another staff member (I assume part of the kitchen staff) returned and accused her of putting it there herself.  I couldn't believe the manner in which this staff member acted. We were humiliated and felt so sad that our friend's bridal brunch was completely ruined. She ended up not even touching the food (we still paid for it, which was fine with us). Overall, I couldn't believe that this happened and I highly recommend not coming here. There are plenty of other places that will treat their customers this way."

My friends and I loved the trendy atmosphere with loud music. Servers were very friendly and were very attentive about refilling bottomless mimosas.

Service was great, we felt like we were in for a great boozy brunch.We had the bottomless mimosas, and food, 6 of us total. After the food was served, service got dramatically worse and worse. It took longer each time to get a refill on our mimosas, the longest we waited being 35 minutes after we specifically asked for a refill (to which the waitress replied ""when I get to it"". Meanwhile we watched the waitress dance, take shots, and play with a kinder surprise egg with other customers. Then we finally get champagne poured. But no orange juice. Waiting another 10 minutes for the orange juice, then over 20 minutes just to get our bill.Poor service, poor attitude. I understand when a place is busy and under staffed, but a little courtesy goes a long way.The table next to us (table of 3) realized that gratuity was added as a service fee on their bill (it was not on any of our bills) and had to argue to get it removed. Food was nothing special and they don't do substitutions (switch ham for bacon, etc). The Rosewood Famous breakfast was 2 over cooked eggs, 1 small sausage, 2 strips of bacon, a small square of ham, and the most over peppered handful of potatoes I've ever had, with 3 small slices of fruit, for $14.Don't waste your money."

Someone from the resto gave a rec for this place and our hotel being across the street it was a no brainer. So by luck, we found ourselves seated right in front of the stage on the first Tuesday of the month eating and enjoying some drinks on their ""jam night.""Food - we ordered a salmon tartare and steak sandwich to share. The salmon tartare was refreshing and came with an interesting combo of fried oranges (yes, make no mistake...oranges) and onions that was tasty and inventive. The steak sandwich was juicy, tender, and came with a side salad and crispy fries. Overall, I would rate the food 3.5 stars.Drinks - Had a ""last word"" and the hubs ordered an old fashioned that came with a mason jar filled with smoke to add the smokiness to the drink. Would highly recommend the old fashioned as I drank rounds of that for the rest of the night. 4 stars for the drinks.Ambience - Wow. This is what drove this place to 5 stars. Every first Tuesday of the month they have a jam night where musicians (many of them strangers to each other) come and jam together and the result is both amazing and magical. I am a fan of live music but the talent from the people that played on stage was mesmerizing to watch.  As my hubby and I promised to leave after every song we ended up staying till 1am due to FOMO on the great music that was to be had before us. Add this to a clean bathroom and the above said good food and great drinks...I was in bliss. Thank you, thank you, thank you, rosewood for making our last night in Montreal so memorable. Couldn't have asked for a better night!"

The place and the ambiance are okay, music was fine but a little loud making it a little hard to communicate. Their brunch menu is simple with 5-6 choices. The service was not good; my friends had to ask twice for their coffee and it came 15 minutes later, as for the food, it came after 50 minutes (not exaggerating a bit). I ordered the steak and eggs, which says on the menu that it included 2 fried eggs, however it came only with one (and after 50 minutes!!). The food overall was alright, nothing special. I also want to mention that tables around us were also waited for their order to arrive a long time. Unsurprisingly, we also had to wait to wait 10 minutes to pay for our bills. Only positive thing is that they gave us a small discount on our bills to apologize for the terrible service.I don't recommend this place for brunch."

(The bar next door also contributed to the noise.) This went on until 1 or 2am each morning, interrupting my beauty sleep!Anyway, not wanting the hassle of changing plans, I ended up here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  The space is interesting;  2 storeys, and an a-ha! for me when I noticed the stage is set up right in the front of the resto, thus explaining why I heard so much bass.There was an interesting crowd here;  and despite it being afternoon, it was still busy.  Overall,  service was casual and friendly.  And the food was just OK;  nothing to write home about.  But after food arrived, we were checked on a few times to make sure everything was OK.  Sunday was their brunch menu, and I had the breakfast sandwich while my friend had the chicken and pancakes.  The breakfast sandwich was OK;  however, I wasn't asked whether I wanted bacon or sausage (and I had forgotten to specify when I ordered) and it defaulted to a sausage patty.  The chicken was nuggets and she said it was ""meh"" but the serving was a generous size.   While we didn't partake, many did order their bottomless mimosas.An average meal, with an average price point.  While the food wasn't memorable, I will always remember this place as the cause of two nights of lost sleep due to their noisy customers!"

/user_details?userid=lIwkJuhOwktpzRTW_riRoA,Vada O.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"DO NOT come here if you want to leave feeling like a decent human being, the kitchen staff will come out personally and accuse you of wrong doing - expecting to have a none confrontational brunch was too much to ask! We had made a reservation for twelve people on a Sunday morning, the place was still quiet. When the food came, my friend had pulled out a long piece of hair only 2 bites in, it wasn't laid on top of the food, we saw her pull it out from within the sandwich with food stuck to it. She quietly placed it back onto the plate and pointed this out to a wait-staff, he took it away and said another one would come right out. Then, the star of our story, a kitchen staff personally brought over the new plate, and said 'I checked this plate and made sure there was no hair in it, also checked that none of the waitstaff has long hair, so just be careful this time.' We asked for clarification, did he just accuse us of putting hair in the food?!!?He repeated himself again, in a less subtle manner this time: 'I'm just saying that there is no one in the kitchen with 8 inch long black hair, but I'm looking around the table (12 females with hair) and just be glad we are not charging you for this 2nd plate.' WHOAH, WHOAH, WHOAH. At this point, we all lost our appetite. THE NERVE! There was no need for accusation, we were not whaling about finding a hair in the food in the first place as if trying to scam the establishment out of a free meal, also, it is a waste of food & time on us to 'claim' there was hair just for a fucking new plate. It was very unprofessional as a service establishment to accuse their customers of being criminals. If you want to know about the actual taste of the food, it was only subpar. My salmon on the avocado toast was dry, and I didn't think a sandwich of this nature could be flavorless, but it was def on the bland side, so get your hot-sauce ready!The waiter pushed for the house cinnamon buns as a 'starter', it turned out pretty good.Lets hope you won't run the risk of dealing with that egoistic prick from the kitchen staff."

One of the best restaurants I have ever been to.I will start with the poutine which is the reason that we came here. This poutine is super fancy and elevated. I loved the veal gravy! The portion was very generous.My husband and the husband and another couple that we were with got this delicious-looking burger. They both devoured it and loved it. Portions were huge and the chef was super attentive to how  my husband like his Burger. All of the food here tastes like the chef has studied the food and worked his best to find the exact ingredients to perfect it.For my entree I got homemade chicken nuggets. They were delicious. Fries were well-cooked the perfect amount of crispy and potatoey. Chicken nuggets were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and tasted like real chicken. I love the sauce they have to dip it into I think it's like a spicy BBQ sauce definitely homemade. They also have a ranch that's out of this world. My only recommendation was that I would have ordered the salad it would have paired better with the chicken nuggets.I can't really comment on the drinks because I didn't drink alcohol there but I know that the rest of the people in my party really enjoyed their drinks and my soda came out really fast. What really sealed the deal on me for this restaurant was there wait staff. We came very late when they were obviously already cleaning up in the kitchen and they seem to have reopened the kitchen just for us. It meant so much because we were only in Montreal for one night! And our waiter was the perfect combination of respectful of our space and conversation and attentive to what we needed as far as sides drinks Etc.This restaurant is so good that I would consider going to it twice over trying a new restaurant next time I come to Montreal.

I had the classic breakfast, my girlfriend had their breakfast poutine which was awesome. Last night however out of the 5 times I went, I wasn't too pleased by my experience. First my beer was at an unpleasant temperature, somewhere between cold and room temperature! I tried the croquettes de poulet (Chicken nugget) and they were a little burnt and tough in the inside! I also ordered their ""Popcorn Shrimp"" to go, which is normally sooooo good! What I was told would take 2 minutes took 15 minutes and weirdly I sat there while my take out container sat on the ledge of the kitchen window however I was told they weren't ready. The manager Dan was awesome and compensated me with a free beer, which I didn't finish because it wasn't cold enough. By the time I got my order and went home (home is connected to their parking lot), the shrimp that JUST came out the fryer was ice cold! Could it have been because they were sitting their the whole time? I went back and had my order ""fixed"" right away. Which in other words was throwing the shrimp back into the fryer.

/user_details?userid=7pMUCn7zyGp0Pf7GOSFOwQ,Brendan C.,"Groton, MA",4 star rating,"Awesome, creative cocktails and both bartenders I interacted with were absolutley top notch. Bravo to Rosewood, we visited many bars in the area and they are certainly one of, if not thee top one."
/user_details?userid=mSdkLieZeMrK4OaysXYK2g,Gerard F.,"Nassau County, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing customer service, reasonable prices, and very delicious food.  They have bottomless Mimosas on Sunday for only $25 which my wife ordered and thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered the Breakfast Poutine. It was absolutely delicious and very filling. I highly reccomend this place, and I can't emphasize enough their high quality of food and customer service."
/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Hummmm tough call. I really wish I could give a 2,5 star. I can't so I've decided to give 2 stars and here's why: first the place is kinda blah. I didn't feel it had any personality or charm or interest. They have TV everywhere which bothers me. If it's not a sports bar why having TV? Also they play all kind of random music; I don't think it's to please any kind of crowd but more By lack of personality again. I mean pick a style, choose a personality and assume. Besides that the other positive thing (!) is the service. It's not the best service ever but it's friendly and nice enough. Now. The food. Well, in my opinion It's not good. They have a bar type of menu. I have nothing against that. We shared the kefta skewers and the popcorn shrimps as staters. The kefta were tasteless but thank to the tzatziki it was ok. The popcorn shrimp a were huge and good enough. For the main course I took the classic burger and the poutine. The beef patty was super hard and over cooked, that's what I can say about that burger. The poutine was very tasteless. Too bad because the fries by themselves were good and so the cheese. But the sauce was in need of salt, pepper and just taste really. So yeah, I wouldn't go back. Maybe for a drink but really if I have"
/user_details?userid=eBZCSrn-e1-JK9GES9ZKyg,Kris S.,"Albany Park, Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Absolutely loved this bar! Walked in and felt at home - two straight times in a row......that's not something that happens unless it is truly a spot that not only the owners (Jonas is a rockstar) but the staff (Tanya is AMAZING) is excited about!  It felt like home....period!
/user_details?userid=oSaNVL_-gesebv-YqK1fdQ,Cindy S.,"North Brunswick, NJ",5 star rating,First time in montreal and stopped here for a casual dinner.  Drinks were awesome.  Food was very good. However. ...service.... this is why they got 5 stars.  Impeccable! !  Our server helped us read the thru the menu as we don't speak French.  She made wonderful recommendations. She even treated us to dessert when she found out we were celebrating our anniversary.  She made our day.  Wonderful!
/user_details?userid=mWRANff-Im6__RkmmjG0sw,Cary W.,"Flushing, NY",1 star rating,"I was recommended by a colleague to come here for brunch. I was pretty disappointed with the food, it was only subpar and the service was not great either. The food was bland, i got the avocado toast and it was flavorless. My wife got the pork belly and it was over salted.  I asked for water and coffee refill and it took over 10 mins for someone to come back with it and the restaurant was pretty empty with only two other tables."
/user_details?userid=N1U5StCGfdAbAG6y1pNamA,Keith C.,"Shoreview, MN",5 star rating,"Excellent drinks.   Good conversation.   Relaxing environment.   Polite bartenders & staff.    I didn't eat, but my friend thought his burger was delicious.    Music was festive.  Looks fairly subdued from the street, but I enjoyed my evening.   Tons of options in the area.  Give them a chance."
/user_details?userid=ngO6OkT3lKIX2ut1hJ7x8g,Stephanie S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We went to Rosewood for Cocktail Invasion week and tried a few cocktails. The vibe was great and the staff were really friendly. We only had an appetizer but I will definitely be back to try the full menu. Definitely worth checking out.
/user_details?userid=SE0KcwPmqFbACAQI8UQoeg,Shan X.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food was meh and pricey for what you were given, but the Yellowfin burger was good. The service was irritating, taking plates and napkins from you before you have had the time to swallow you last bite (and there was no rush for our table at the time). Pushy with the drinks. Halfway through your cocktail they kept trying to take it away.All in all ok but no more."
/user_details?userid=coMtm8Qlsp47p7Mo_Cf8AA,Chad R.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"super chill vibe, friendly staff, cool decore. Wish I found this place sooner as I was staying across the street.  look it up."
/user_details?userid=frlKbObavggbdI6cWYO8XA,Marie-Pierre L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love the space. Burgers were good but small. Expect to eat many things if you go for dinner. Drinks are great, they create their own sodas. Overall I enjoyed my experience."
/user_details?userid=sOv1-3ecNul97awYnmZFkA,Stephane V.,"Moncton, Canada",1 star rating,"We came here on a friends recommendation as he knows the owner. The overall experience was ok, but we were not impressed with the service and the food quality. We had to consistently ask for our mimosas to be refilled, when the food arrived it was cold. Now that being said, the food tasted very good, but the fact that it was cold put a damper on things . Changes to menu are not an option, so for our gluten free friends it was a little difficult to find something to eat. There is Also no wifi available to restaurant patrons . Overall a disappointing experience."
/user_details?userid=HWW9O6UQ6R609kCeggrRZQ,Gabriella M.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"From the fantastic tunes and hip vibe, to the incredibly yummy eats, you can tell the staff at Rosewood is passionate about their craft (they are all very cool/friendly too). Try their homemade lemonade and unique cocktails: original, tasty, and fresh. Delicious food, lively atmosphere, and good company: all great reasons to go back!"
/user_details?userid=bzhRoEwYXi6fHYDh4ST-Xw,Cameron D.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"Stumbled on this place while looking for someplace that wasn't $40 per plate. The food here is great, and cocktails are even better. If Sam is bartending you are in for a treat, ask him for a a ""crossroad"". Also, the Cesar Japonais is a new delicious twist on a ceaser.  I wish I lived in Montreal, so I could be a regular. We were only here 4 nights, but we came back for our last night meal because it was so good!"
/user_details?userid=eTs5pKrtfyxd1gXbSiApLw,Natalie C.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"Rosewood was decent. Decor is very cool, location is great, but the food was quite simple. Yes, prices were equivalent, but when you order a salad, you expect more than 5% of toppings over romaine lettuce."
/user_details?userid=kplh74WTyjpFZCcMi1wGdA,Abby C.,"Pulaski, NY",5 star rating,Awesome place!! We came on Sunday hoping for lunch and found out they only do brunch on Sunday's but this ended up working out perfectly! I had the breakfast burger which came with a side of very fresh fruit and home fries I was very happy with all of it and it wasn't too big! I was able to finish the whole thing. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry pancakes which were gone within 3 minuets of our waitress setting them down. Bartender and staff are very friendly. Great noisy atmosphere!
/user_details?userid=urcWQ27y175vViv_D2DhPw,MJ J.,"Denver, CO",3 star rating,The staff were so friendly and helpful however the poutine was a bit salty for my taste. Be aware that this place is not vegetarian friendly. Besides a side salad and fries there are no vegetarian options besides dessert.
