Their special offer on Wednesdays is 1$ oysters and 5$ Aperol Spritz. They have a beautiful orange terrasse and the indoor seating is cozy as well with plants hanging from the ceiling and white tiles everywhere.The Aperols were very good, the oysters were to die for, as well as the vinegar sauce to accompany them.The scallop entry was good, they were grilled to perfection and tasted great, although the plate was slightly expensive (15$). We also had a grilled octopus salad that apparently was a newer addition to their menu. We told them that the vinaigrette needed something extra, as the salad was a little bland. They were comprehensive and welcomed our criticism very well.Overall, the experience was good! We ordered the oysters after the entrées and they took a fairly long time to arrive. We in fact got a little bit impatient because of that. However, our waitress and the chef were generous enough to offer them for free because of the wait! We also got free shots, which was very appreciated. The service was definitely exemplary.I would definitely recommend this place on Wednesdays and for the oysters! The seafood is very good and they have a lovely staff. It would be the perfect restaurant for a date as well!"

The place was relatively empty and we got seated immediately. The servers were friendly and the food was very good. I ordered the red snapper grilled whole fish that came with chermoula, falafel, labneh, and turnip. I found the falafel a little too hard but the fish was very fresh and was grilled to perfection. Overall, I find this place a little expensive but the ambiance, service, and quality of ingredients used was very good."

The first service is a little salty but overall very good, my fav is the main course - it's really delicious and the seafoods are fresh!!For the dessert I ordered the chocolate tart, it combines coffee with chocolate, so if you don't want something too sweet you will no doubt enjoy it!! And don't forget to add one cup of latte later :)Atmosphere is quiet and staffs are helpful and patient, location is near the bus stop/metro so transportation is also convenient. If you are a seafood lover plz come!"

Truly loved every detail which created a lovely ambiance. Secondly, the food was so delicious!  Great quality and packed with lots of flavor. Every dish we each ordered was delicious. We tried the grilled octupus as a starter and it was great! It was tender and juicy. Next we tried the seafood Risotto which was so delicious. We ordered dessert of course - maple pecan tart which was so yummy!  This is a great resto for birthday celebrations, anniversary, date night or simply friends night out!  I will definately go back to try out their other dishes. Must try at least once. Yummy! Check out my pics!"
/user_details?userid=9TYpecJwv-HtNJtadramWQ,Chris U.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Really great all-around experience on a chilly Saturday night.   It was a beef heavy week in Montreal, so we searched for seafood and this place lived up to its photos and reviews.  The space itself is beautiful, white and fresh.  A small cocktail menu had a few choices and it's wine list is extensive with some interesting selections.  Our appetizers included a mushroom mezze luna pasta and shellfish with pork belly. Both were excellent.  The waitress did a great job describing the Mediterranean Sea bass for two, served Lebanese style, so we went that route.  It's was really superb, full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  A small and unique ginger pot de creme was a great was to end the meal.  Service was friendly and efficient."

/user_details?userid=LB1dC42iB6WSjPVPwt3Zqg,Meg K.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came for dinner with my boyfriend for 830, the Restaurant was quite full. The initial service was very good and our waitress was amazing. We started off with the burrata (very pretty, has strawberries which were very yummy) and salmon tartar ( amazing, little spicy, great textures) and for main we had the octopus entree (much bigger than expected) and the lobster linguine (enjoyed this plate the least but was still very good and full of flavour, must like mushroom). We also got a plate of fries. For drinks I had a glass of Chardonnay and my boyfriend had one of their special cocktails which was a type of grapefruit drink. Overall easy 9/10! Will definitely return on a Tuesday or Wednesday when they have their specials."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boss recommended me this restaurant so my boyfriend and I went on Saturday night. We managed to get a table last minute. The restaurant was not very busy.It is a very nice looking restaurant... white walls and tons of plants.My boyfriend and I had a glass of white wine followed by the grilled octopus appetizer and the homemade bread with three butters. We basically ordered everything the waitress recommended. The grilled octopus was good but now wow. It also had white beans and black sauce around it. The bread was so soft! I don't usually eat bread but it was so good that I had two pieces. The bread was accompanied by three butters: a caviar butter, a salted butter and a smoky butter. The caviar was my favorite but the smoky butter was my boyfriend's favorite. For mains my boyfriend had the Zarzuela de pescado y mariscos. It tasted very Spanish to me. The dish was filled with seafood: cod fish, mussels, clams, and calamari. The sauce was a bit spicy and tomato based with pieces of almonds and chorizo. I had the seared scallops main with squash cavatelli, mussels, mushrooms, solid brown butter and pine nuts. This dish was really delicious!! I preferred it to the Zarzuela hands down. We were too full for dessert and nothing on the dessert menu appealed to us.  By the time we finished our meal they were closing up the restaurant anyway.This restaurant met my expectations. I definitely recommend it. The seafood is really good. Normally I would order the meat but the seafood is where it is at!"

We gotThere early and let us have a seat and a drink until they opened. The food was amazing, and they were super helpful with all of my pain in the derrière food allergies.Thank you for making our trip to Montreal memorable."
/user_details?userid=7z_Ni6dshqTWTXVd2O24hw,Vivian M.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",5 star rating,"This was by far the BEST food I had during my 5-day trip to Montreal and Quebec! I had the entrecôte with bone marrow, mash potatoes, fried broccoli and mushrooms (either chanterelle or oyster, not sure).  It came with a mustard based sauce that I requested on the side. If Inever come nack to Montreal I am 100% coming back here!"
/user_details?userid=dkMecffl3qMcwpTsgteWpA,Ed M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,This was a pleasant surprise for a Sunday morning. The scones were very good and my chicken and Walden's were delicious. A great brunch spot. The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and great recommendations. We will return.
/user_details?userid=1UEFKaz54ATJSf5Z4-W7Ag,Doy M.,"Columbus, NJ",3 star rating,"I booked a table for 17 people on a Sunday evening. The booking was made at least 3 hours before arrival. The food was great. All of it. The downside? They were out of so many things on the menu. The food all took about an hour to get served. The place was not even halfway packed. All night the waiter's excuse for the absence of a few items on the menu and the long wait for food was that they ""were not ready for such a big group"". You had a 3 hour lead time for the kitchen to prep. The 17 of us represented 2/3 of all your guests that evening. No excuse for such a bad performance by the kitchen."

/user_details?userid=_LWjwNe_lQQwBF4m-yeXSw,Linda D.,"Quincy, MA",4 star rating,"We came on on a Saturday night. The service was very nice. The food was flavorful, I would recommend the hen and clams. The food did take over 30 minutes to come out, but worth the wait. However, the gentalman next to us did not think so. He was there once we sat down and our whole table received food before him. He definitely let the waiter know and tried to get as much free stuff as he could from the situation."
