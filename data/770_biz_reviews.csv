I was there with 4 of my buddies & we shared a few dishes; Pit Boss (combo of chicken, ribs, pulled pork) & some nachos & wings. The food was great but not as awesome as the service; from the moment we were greeted upon our arrival til we left. The ladies that were in charge (3 of them) of taking care of us were so amicable & professional. They are all part of the ownership & their passion & dedication to making this an enjoyable evening was second to none.Prices are reasonable as well, so needless to say that our experience was nothing short of perfect.Keep up the great work, I will definitely be back to try out their outdoor terrace.Merci Mesdames !"

I ordered an Alabama Chicken sandwich and the pulled pork poutine, and was told it would take about 20 minutes. when the time was almost up, the estimate was changed to an hour. It arrived cold, soggy, and had obviously been waiting for ages; I suspect my order was rolled in with another to save them time. The poutine was alright (after 10 minutes in the oven) but extremely sweet and heavily cinnamony. The chicken sandwich was not good at all. I'm disappointed that a nearby BBQ place is disappointing to this extent, since I do love BBQ. But I won't be going back here."

Street, in an old antique shop, in Montreal district called Griffintown. Le Boucan is known for its ribs, pulled pork and chicken wings as well as it's beautiful bourbons.On my last visit on Friday night I did notice a slight decrease in the food quality, quantity and ambiance.The reason I always come back here is because of the wings, they're smoked and sweet and the Alabama sauce is on point. I don't have any complaints about the wings I enjoyed every bite. However the salmon was a small ""7 oz and tasteless piece of fish,the sides were even worse.. frozen veggies. The ribs were dry and came with no sauce so had to ask for some, the sides again weren't very good the coleslaw needed salt and salt and salt. My salad was great fresh greens and I swapped out the dressing for the Alabama sauce and it was great. The most disappointing part was the cake at the end last time it took them 30 minutes to make it and it was amazing this time half that time and you could tell it wasn't fully cooked. So disappointing.I Over heard the waitress telling clients that it's late and that they usually don't serve ppl so late almost hinting them to get out, pretty dumb as there's so many dumping places on notre dame you don't want to lose clients.I've noticed it's not as busy as it used to be seeing that there's so many new hip and chic spots.So let's break it down Food :3.5Ambiance:3Price:3They need to step their game up as there's loads of new spots opening daily, I get it that they are one of the only smoked house but we have rube and black strap as well."

We walked into a pretty empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 6:30. The bartender greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. When we said no and inquired if we needed one she shrugged, sighed and then pointed us to a table. No other tables came in while we were there, roughly 45 minutes. I asked if they still had red stripe (beer) on the menu and she informed me she didn't but tried to guide me to other red beers that I would like. When I asked if she had any pale lagers she looked at me funny and continues to offer me red beers, almost confused as to why I'd ask for a pale beer. Red stripe is a pale lager and not a red but oh well. #beersnob The waitress that brought our food was very pleasant and smiley. We ordered a pulled pork poutine and Mac and cheese; Both REALLY good, however the poutine doesn't come with a lot of fries or cheese but still really good. For a dollar more you can get their home made habanero sauce and it's DELICIOUSLY SPICY and compliments the Mac and cheese nicely. Good food, probably caught the bartender on a bad day which sucks but happens, would go again tho."

My friends came here for their ribs.  The restaurant is small- it was annoying because there wasn't enough coat hooks to put our coats away .The one that is available- I had to stand on the chairs of the booth to reach it (kind of ridiculous). For food I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of their staple cheesy corn and potato salad. The beef was very well cooked and tender. Great cuts. As an overall meal- I wasn't crazy about it- maybe because I expected more from a smokehouse. The sides were also average. For dessert, the buttermilk pie with ice cream was pleasantly nice- not too sweet. As a smokehouse- I would grade this as average until this I will be on the search for Montreal's finest."

I made a reservation for 6pm, and we were told when we sat down that they need the table at 8pm, so we felt like we might be rushed. We chose this place because we had a vegan in our group, and the waitress seemed very knowledgeable on which foods were vegan, so that was good, but apparently the vegan selections of food were not great. Lacked flavour and our dinnerware seemed generally unimpressed. The Mac and cheese and tomato soup were a hit. Myself and another shared the pitboss and added brisket. Everything was just ok. Nothing super spectacular, but all adequately tasty. The brownie for dessert was very good, but seemed pricey at $9. All in all, not a bad place, but not one I'll be rushing back to any time soon. There are better smokehouses in Montreal."

My mum and I stumbled upon it after looking for certain stores in the area. It was such a gem to find.  Located in a lovely area in Montreal it is so beautifully decorated with amazing  vintage pieces carefully put together . Just as beautiful the interior is, the exterior and patio are great as well .  The menu is the best part though  ,I am shocked that  more people aren't raving about the fact that not only do they have an amazing menu with traditional smoke house style food but they also have a PERFECT vegan and vegetarian menu including the same food but veg. It's  crazy to me that not a single review raves about the vegan vegetarian aspect and instead nit picks weird little details that have nothing to do with whether a restaurant is good or not.  It's a beautiful clean  restaurant with amazing patio  run by lovely and kind people with delicious Montreal  food and even offers a whole veg menu  . I honestly don't know what else anyone would want in a restaurant because this exceeded  all of our expectations and we will be back every time we visit Montreal."

It was 3pm and every other place closes between 3-5 on Notre Dame St. Small and dingy smokehouse it is. The staff is very friendly and she suggested if I'm a newbie to try the pulled pork poutine. They have homemade lemonade, iced tea and alcohol on the menu. I did have to send it back once because it was not hot but it did come back sizzling. I can only say it was ok for someone who was hungry. It lacked flavour and realistically I was dreaming of the steak I could of had at Grinders. I did enjoy the company so that's a plus."

I'd like to make sure that everyone understands even businesses and those in the creative profession have off days. That being said, here was my experience at Le Boucan:After being seated with only two other tables occupied, it took about 15 minutes for us to get our menus. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but there was only one server and she was also tending bar.We ordered the pulled pork poutine and the half chicken. The food prep took only about 15 minutes, but I saw the window where the food was sitting from.my table, and it ended up sitting in the window, drying under the heat lamps for another 15 minutes.When we finally got the food, the white meat of the chicken was dry and inedible without the accompanying bbq sauce. The dark meat was moist, but flavorless.The side of potato salad was flavorful and unfortunately was the best thing we had there.The side of coleslaw was surprisingly flavorless. I didn't know it was possible to make coleslaw so flavorless. It was almost as if it wasn't dressed in anything but water. That coleslaw will now make me question every coleslaw I see on a menu.The poutine was good, but nothing special.I don't leave reviews unless I'm really disappointed or really thrilled about a restaurant, and unfortunately, Le Boucan is in the former."

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"TLDR: Juicy delicious food and dynamic servers.Small restaurant that serves big flavour. I was torn on what to order, but in the end I went with the 5 napkin burger with the cheesy corn and coleslaw. The two juicy 4 oz patties (8oz total) was topped with pickles, 12-hour smoked bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and bbq sauce. It was huge and I definitely required more than 5 napkins to keep my hands clean. The flavours were on point, and I enjoyed every bite of it. I ordered the cheesy corn because I wanted to know what it was, and while it was tasty I regretted not choosing the fries. The slaw was a nice and refreshing contrast to the rest of the hearty and heavy meal.The servers were a delight, and we had a lovely conversation about spicy peppers with them. I would definitely go back to Le Boucan the next time I'm craving some BBQ."

It was a later Saturday evening when I came in. I came by myself and half the restaurant was empty. There were perhaps two tables full and there were at least 5-6 seats open at the bar. I asked the lady next to me if the seat next to her was taken and she responded no. I took a seat and a gentleman asked me something in French.I said ""I'm sorry, I don't speak French but I would like a menu for dinner, please"". He said ""oh, okay, hold on a minute"". After a few moments, he returned and said ""Because you don't have a reservation, we can't serve you until at least 9:30 pm."" The time was currently 8:20. Obviously there was one of two things going on here: a.) this restaurant is extremely mismanaged and will turn away paying customers when literally half their restaurant is empty or b.) they don't want to serve tourists/English speaking customers. Either way, they are fools and if they keep it up, they'll soon be out of business. Good luck, or as you say in French...bonne chance!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Place is fine. My favourite item is their chicken wings - nicely smokey and spiced. Their mustard sauce goes well with this. All other items are average though. I usually also order their mac 'n cheese with the wings and am slightly disappointed. Venue is reasonably nice though I mostly order delivery - not on my short list of go-to restos (even in the casual class).

We ended up splitting a pitcher of red sangria which was just the right amount for 2 people to get a good buzz while eating absurd amounts of meat. It also was the perfect amount of fruit to wine without having that harsh acidic taste some red sangria has. She got the full order of pulled pork poutine, and I helped finish it because it was ENORMOUS. You can tell the pork is smoked, it tastes amazing even if it wasn't smothered in the perfect amount of house bbq sauce, gravy and cheese curds. I got 16 of the smoked wings with the mustard (basically like a classic honey mustard style bbq from South Carolina) and the house bbq. I couldn't pick a favorite, but my hands were a clear indication of how much I enjoyed the wings when I was done. I needed all the wet wipes the table had to offer. Also, the wings were smoked to perfection - still juicy and with perfectly done skins. I liked that the sauce was on the side so you could taste how good they were solo. Also the staff was super friendly! Definitely recommend."

My boyfriend spent a lot of time as a kid in North Carolina and loves BBQ -- even he was impressed. The portions are generous, the waitstaff friendly and gracious, and the atmosphere welcoming. While everything was delicious (including the mac and cheese, ribs, the must-order pulled pork poutine), a special shout out goes to the potato salad which really hit the spot. I don't know what they put in it, but it reminds me of everything good and holy in the world. My only disappointment was that I was too full for dessert."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really wasn't sure what to give Le Boucan for a rating after my experience here.  Read on and you'll see why.  It was a Friday night when we came here and though it was empty when we showed up at six it was packed when we left.  The restaurant is small so a reservation would be a really good idea.Being Friday I figured I would get a cocktail so I started with a mint Julep.  The cocktails seem expensive here but they are very strong so I feel the price was justified.  I followed it up with a Moscow Mule which was a little to heavy on the lime for me.  I prefer the ginger to stand out more in this particular cocktail.  There is also a decent selection of bourbons for you to try out and they usually have one on special.We were four and we split the Pit Boss which gives you a chance to try a bit of everything.  It included chicken, ribs, pulled pork, coleslaw, potato salad and fries.  For me the winner was the pulled pork which was very tender and juicy.  I also thought that the chicken was well seasoned and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The ribs though were a little on the dry side.  I would suggest that if you're going to get this dish only do it if you're two or three people tops and our waitress did say it was meant for that number of people.  I wasn't very hungry so it was a decent amount of food but if I had been hungrier it probably wouldn't have been.Now had we stopped after the Pit Boss I would have given Le Boucan four stars easily.  I had enjoyed the food up until then and in all I was having an enjoyable experience.  However, we thought we would split a plate of nachos which turned out to be a total ripoff.  For $16 (which is already expensive for nachos) the portion was pathetically tiny.  Normally I am not one to complain in restaurants unless the food is undercooked, cold or something is seriously wrong with the flavour but this was ridiculous.  We brought this to the attention of our waitress and she took it back to the kitchen to try and see if she could get more chips or something added to it.  At this point the manager came over and tried to explain why the nachos had to be so expensive.  She offered to discount the price %50 for us which we agreed to but when she went to see if the nachos were still in the kitchen they had been tossed.  Needless to say we were all a little miffed by the time everything was said and done.I'm not really sure what to make of my experience here.  Like I said if we had just stopped after our main meal I would have no trouble recommending this place.  Also if the nachos hadn't been tossed I would have been a little more forgiving and probably given the restaurant three stars."

We went straight for sharing the Smoked Pork Meatballs and the Pit Boss Platter, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I ordered a Mint Julep and buddy ordered a Mojito. First off, we came in for a very late afternoon lunch so we basically almost had the entire place to ourselves, no issues with service or delays or anything. The waitress was very friendly.Food and drinks-wise, drinks were fabulous and while I do enjoy BBQ, it's not something I can eat everyday, the sauce the amount of food involved is too rich and too heavy. Having said that, the ribs here are great, can't go wrong with them, ditto the pulled pork. This is just me but I prefer my chicken with really crispy skin, which it isn't here. I also found that there was something sweet on the french fries, not sure if their fries spice mix includes sugar, but I really don't think it's needed. There has been a plethora of smoke houses and American-style BBQ joints popping up all over Montreal and having a bit of a sweet tooth, I always scan the dessert offerings. I saw the Bacon Brownie but I think that's a little too much meat-overkill. I was stuffed so didn't get to try anything out, but I still have yet to find a Montreal place that offers Hummingbird Cake and a proper Southern Chocolate Mud Pie.Oh well. The search continues."

They have a great selection of drinks, southern style food & drinks actually. I had a drink called the southern wheeler i think, the tipsyness made me forget its name. you couldn't taste much of the alcohol in it but it had quite a kick ! The Mac & cheese entree ( 8$ ) was great, I should have stopped there but I was greedy and wanted more so I got a half rack of ribs that I couldn't finish but they were good, a bit dryer than last time i tried them. The fries were good but I think they forgot the dressing on the coleslaw this time. Ill be ordering the wings again for sure, I think they were smoked, really good flavor and crispiness to them, comes with dipping sauce of your choice, Boucan bbq, honey mustard and bbq and white sauce. The place is always crowded on the weekends and Friday nights. They do take reservations so reserve in advance because its tiny. It's tiny but cozy and rustic which is so my style. ( not fancy )At some point they dimmed the lights and it made the atmosphere somewhat romantic and with some southern comfort and bourbon in my drink, I felt really comfy. To finish off, The buttermilk pie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is not describable so you are going to have to try it because its worth it."

We liked that there was fun 80s music playing, but we were awkwardly squeezed into a middle table where we were constantly in the waiter's way and a bit too close to tables next to us. The service is almost too fast to enjoy the experience of eating out - the food came only 5-10 minutes after ordering. (When I called to make a reservation, they told me we would have 2 hours - I think we were there about 45-minutes).Lastly, the waiter looked like me like I was an alien whenever I asked a question/request, such as: ""Can I please have a knife?"" Apparently, that's an odd request, even when you have a huge chicken breast to eat. It was just odd service. In the end, there are places I can go that have good food, atmosphere and service, so I wouldn't choose Le Boucan again."

I didn't hesitate to finally go in when I happened to be in the area last week. We were two and shared a pulled pork poutine with a rack of ribs. I think the poutine was very well made and tasty. While the ribs were very tender and had plenty of sauce on them, I felt that it lacked a bit of flavour. Maybe it needed more marinating. The corn had a funny taste to it...I couldn't tell what it was or why, but it tasted like artificial flavour to me for some reason. Overall an ok place."

One of my friends had it as well and we felt exactly the same. There was some mystery meat on top of the patty, maybe bacon, but it was raw. My 3 other friends had the chicken and all thought it was real dry. Everything else about this joint was cool, the decor, waitresses, terrace, etc...I will give it another try when someone suggests it.

He eventually did get a better knife for her, but that isn't really something he should be arguing. Get a better knife - it's a simple request. He was also rude when she asked a simple question about having gluten free bread. It wasn't a judgement, just a question. We weren't expecting them to have gluten free buns or bread, but making us feel dumb for asking isn't what we're looking for. The food was spot-on, can't deny that. The rest of the staff seemed quite nice, too. First impressions go a long way, and our server simply didn't do his job. Beyond that, it's a bit small but those are the only negatives. Not the best barbecue I've ever had, but certainly top 5. I hope you have a better server if you try this place."

/user_details?userid=5xaJ24Th_wu05EajCrLi7w,Katie Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Pulled pork poutine. Does anything else need to be said? Okay, I get it, some details might help. I realize there are punk, wannabe poutines out there, that don't use curds, but believe me, le boucan has the right stuff, as much meat as fries, and as many squeaky curds as gravy. It's massive and will stop you in your tracks with deliciousness.We also attacked the ribs, burger, slaw, fries and a bacon brownie, all which are top bbq house choices in my opinion. The burger comes with two cheese blanketed patties, it is not a girly burger by any means. But it was delectable, particularly with the extra mayo on it. Love the bourbon selection here too. Make reservations, it's a teeny place (which as I have mentioned before means they must be masters of their food domain) and you won't want to stand waiting for a table watching the lucky ones devour saucy ribs. It just wouldn't be fair."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Last month, for the event of my birthday, I was looking for a nice relaxed spot to enjoy a great meal amongst friends and perhaps have a few drinks along the way. After decided that (of course) the Burgundy Lion was the happy hour spot we would start at, Le Boucan seemed like the ideal location to continue the evening. It certainly helped that we could simply walk over from the pub... also I just love BBQ. I had only been once prior and quite honestly the events of that first visit are quite hazy for some reason or another. Because of that, I was quite excited to ""re-try"" Le Boucan.Located on a strip of Notre-Dame street that is quite literally booming, Le Boucan is a relatively small restaurant inside that was a nice terrasse out back to enjoy in the summer time. The interior has a rustic barn look - red wood panels on the walls, sliding barn doors at the washrooms, worn wood signs and hand drawn menu boards. The key focus point inside is the bar area with all the bourbon bottles exposed to the patrons to see. It is a very relaxed and enjoyable ambience.Le Boucan is a smokehouse so the menu is all BBQ - pulled pork, ribs, etc. On the drink side, they have a full bar menu with a particular focus on bourbon cocktails. As a starter, we ordered a pitcher of bourbon lemonade because well... I'm completely hooked to the stuff and can't ignore it when it is on a menu. This particularly version of it was quite good - not as sweet of many variants around town but definitely the strongest in terms of bourbon which was perfect for our evening.... but which made the second pitcher ordered later on a little more problematic...Needed a bit of food now, we grabbed some entrees. First up was a plat of Le Boucan's Nachos which I forgot to take a picture of..... either way, excellent plate of nachos with quite a nice amount of toppings over top. Sadly, you will just have to take my word for it. One of my friends ordered the meat balls. Topped with some scallions and served with some croutons and sauce, the meatballs were nice and moist. Nice flavour to them as well.I myself ordered the mac n' cheese. Served in a onion soup bowl, topped with some scallions and some bread crumbs, it was a nice macaroni however the cheese sauce was not creamy enough for my personal tastes. As such, the cheese didn't stick to the macaroni itself very well. The cheese sauce had a nice rich flavour at least but wasn't really one of my favourites.For the mains, most of us wanted to order some pulled pork however our waitress informed us that they had run out! Not cool so we worked around it. However, they had enough for one dish so one of us got the pulled pork poutine. Such a heavenly combination - beautifully tender pork with nice fries, cheese curds and some gravy. I would come back for this dish alone.... I guess I just need to make sure to reserve my portion early when I dine later.Given the lack of pulled pork, I went for the full rack of ribs with fries and cheesy corn. The fries were solid and the cheesy corn is a play on creamed corn which I enjoyed. The real star of course were the ribs. A massive portion of ribs - tons of meat on the bones with a good crust on them. No knife required to remove the meat here... that is the level of tenderness we are talking about. Very nice all around.The only other different main on the table was the rib and chicken combo with the side of potato salad. The chicken was nicely smoked - tender and juicy with a nice smoky flavour. The potato salad was pretty good as well - more on the chunky side of things but still creamy enough. A solid dish all around. Dessert was tempting but frankly at this point, we were too full to even consider the options. That will have to wait until next time.Le Boucan was a solid evening of delicious BBQ and drinks - the perfect setting to celebrate me getting another year older. Our group of 7 walked out happy and contend which is all I could ask more on this evening. BBQ in Montreal is getting better and better - Le Boucan has a solid spot in the best this city has to offer... thankfully I can remember enjoying it this time.Cheers!"

Ordered two pit boss platters and some pulled pork poutine and the Cajun shrimps as an appetizer.The Cajun shrimps while good, didn't really strike me in a ""try this again"" kinda way. Maybe this place needs to serve up some crawfish instead. The pulled pork poutine was as tasty as it was unhealthy. Soft pork with the now gooey yet still crunchy fries. Love it. The platter was excellent with the ribs being the highlight. Tender but not so soft that you don't need to work a bit at the bone, I could have eaten another rack! Their 'cue sauce was fantastic, not too sweet and went great with our meat. The chicken was good too but I found the breast meat a little too dry for my liking. To top it off, I had the bacon brownie. Ridiculous!  As in, ""How did I not have this before!?""Come here with a group or your favourite eating buddy."

The chicken was also very good.  Moist and not dry at all.  The skin had a nice flavor to it as well.The pulled pork was also very good, and when you add the bbq sauce to it, it elevates the flavor.Standard fries and coleslaw, but the potato salad was tasty.In summary, best choice if you want any semblance of what southern BBQ tastes like in Montreal."

The staff is super friendly and makes you feel like you're part of ""Le Boucan family"". When you sit at the bar you'll get to talk to the bartender and waiter like they're your friends; really cool people. The only thing I don't understand is the music they play...like rap and hip hop.

Going to Le Boucan makes you feel like you are visiting one of the restaurants in an episode of Guy Fieri's Diners, Dive-Ins and Dives. I came across this place by accident when all the other restaurants on Notre Dame street were closed once the breakfast hour finished. It's not hard to find this place, you just need to follow your nose. I was lucky to take in the Southern atmosphere and western decorum, as I was enjoying my meal in their terrace in the back. The best part about the terrace is that you can enjoy your meal without all the background noise from the busy streets. Truly an authentic experience worth enjoying again. Did I mention they have bacon brownies? Enough said, try the place out for yourself. Just make sure you bring a hefty wallet."

It's got a cool bar and an out-door section in the back, but isn't really that big overall.We had the Mac 'N Cheese entree. It was OK, but since I'm Australian (and didn't grow up with the whole North-American-imitation-cheese-fixation) it wasn't life-changing.I had the 5 Napkins burger which was good. For the two sides (which you get with every meal) I had fries and corn, which made the meal massif and pretty good value. I really liked the (rib?) sauce on the burger - it was nice and smokey, which shouldn't be surprising as they bill themselves as a smokehouse.The guys next to us had the Pit Boss, and it looks like it would go hard. I'd like to come back and try it. It had pulled pork, ribs, half a chicken, and a few different sides. All of it was covered in the rib sauce, which I totally rate.Will go back here at some stage. It wasn't the cheapest, but good quality and still value for money. I'd really like to try the Bacon Brownies.For the guys: the waitresses here were really hot, and I almost gave them another star just for that. If you're catching up with some mates, go here and get the Pit Boss and check out the waitresses.For the ladies: umm, the decor was... nice?

/user_details?userid=uUMdtwg0Kz8ELfUPFXKmAw,Sandra V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night at 9:00 and there was space for us - I've tried at normal eating time (7-8:30) with no luck. It is literally a glorified walk-in closet..TINY..someone mentioned 40 seats, I think that's probably at max max max capacity. You don't come here for the atmosphere though, you come here for the food..and to that regard, it is a GIANT success. In the MAINS: we tried between us the half-stack pork ribs and the chicken sandwich with white BBQ sauce; STARTERS: chicken wings with mustard BBQ sauce; SIDES: green salad, fries and cheesy corn; DESERT: bacon brownie and sticky toffee pudding.The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious but the most succulent item was by far the pork ribs. They were fall-off-the-bone delicious barbecue comfortness - I'm not a big fan of ribs, they were my boyfriend's choice, but I wish I had taken them...The same goes for the chicken wings with mustard BBQ sauce. The wings fell off the bone and were smoked with a sweet and sour rub - they were hands down some of the best wings I've ever had...and the sauce well, let's just say we hid the sauce behind the napkin dispenser so that we can keep it for our main meals it was SO good.The salad side is really good as far as salad goes..we actually both enjoyed the salad more than our other sides; the fries were just MEH and the cheesy corn wasn't the greatest culinary choice I've ever made.The bacon brownie desert was nothing short of disgusting as there are actually pieces of bacon in it..not in a good way though, just take my word for it. However, if you were so lucky that god made the desert of the day sticky toffee pudding - you would be an absolute fool not to take it...an absolute fool. Definitely on a list of the best deserts I've ever had. hint: it's not actually pudding...its more like toffee sponge cake with caramel and pralines on top...it's just ridiculous..my mouth is watering thinking about it...don't pass on it!not a great alcohol selection and they were out of alot of menu items when we got there but their kitchen closes at 11:00 so it's understandable..All in all, if you've got a craving for late night comfort food; this is the place. Everything on the menu has a smokey taste - and I mean everything - so if that's not your gig then bring your business elsewhere.. I would advise against going too often though, especially if it is your gig, as ""smoked"" foods contain carcinogens and are not safe for frequent consumption...but once in a while, it'll do the soul a great deal of good ;)"

/user_details?userid=1M-3H0aVJdU0P3QZ8LIPqQ,Scott T.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a tough one. First, make reservations. This place is too small to be stuck at the bar with your friends. You don't want to end up like Karine L who had to hear an earful of restaurant antics from employees, because it's true- you will probably hate the place if you sit at the bar- so avoid at all costs, unless you come as a single- then you'll have a good time fraternizing with the staff, if that's ur thing. Okay, well the table they chose for us was brilliant. I couldn't have hand picked a better table, myself. I made special instructions with the resto, because it was a birthday occasion- and even that was carried-out well. Long story short: I gave them some sparklers to put in the dessert- and the waitress waited too long to come out with them, so they burned out mi-chemin. The b-day boy didn't see the action behind his back, but it was pretty funny. Fortunately, they had other larger sparklers, which they put in the buttermilk pie-which was very tasty. So, on to the food... the ribs were excellent and easily beat any of the corporate rib chains in MTL, so if you live around Le Boucan and you still go to Baton Rouge, Madisons, etc for ribs; shame on you. I ordered the combo, so a note about the chicken: weak. It's not dry, but a smoked 1/4 chicken with no dry rub and just a little sauce on the surface is BO-ring. So, the chicken was average 2.5/5. The pulled pork, I didn't try, yet, but I assume it will be on the same level, if they did the same research as for the ribs: a solid 4/5 rating. Fries, coleslaw and salad were great. Creamed corn and potato salad is okay, but not too original. I recommend the cajun shrimp appetizer(9$) to share, but here's the thing there's only 3 shrimps. They should raise the price to 11$, put 4 shrimps and call it a day. As for the burger, it is big(double patty), juicy and flavorful. Not to mention, a surprising find at a BBQ Smokehouse. Between here and Griffintown, locals have some nice variety to choose from when it comes to premium burgers. The decor is nice and fitting, but the washroms... not so much- they need to work on modifying the sliding door or just get a serious door- to avoid patrons near the bar from hearing people eleviating themselves. With the bathroom practically in the dining room- this needs to be taken more seriously. There are many high marks and average marks to give; hence, the 3/5. It seems, they are still trying to develop their methods with time and some improvements they could easily become the best lil' BBQ Pit resto in Montreal, but not without a beef brisket. Which is why I don't take them seriously as a smokehouse, yet. You need to have the holy trinity down pat: pork(ribs, pulld), chicken, beef (ribs and/or brisket). FYI burgers don't count. They also need to understand and master their dryrubs better. Tons of potential here! I look forward to trying the bacon brownie, next time."
