I'd also like to add that I am Egyptian and my Husband is Greek, so we're both very familiar with good Cuisine and particularly a Middle Eastern one. I also have a number of Syrian friends who cooked for me delicious meals, so I know good Syrian food when I see it and taste it. We went to Tazah for dinner on a weekday. We opted for the restaurant, not the sandwich/Cafe place. We felt the restaurant menu offers more options and more authentic dishes. The restaurant was empty so we had the place for ourselves. We orders the Akkawy cheese for starter and they were heavenly.. the fettah makdous and mussaqqa for main dish and Muhhalabiya for dessert. The food was unbelievably tasty. my husband was raving about his Fettah for days (he actually wanted to go back the next day for more) and the dessert was so tasty, with mastika and orange blossom aroma and flavor to die for. Portions were very good for a $20-$25 dish (nothing of the minimalistic french portion stuff). Basically Tazah restaurant is a little gem of a place and I envy Montreal residence for having such a fine Syrian cook amongst them.  we payed over all $75 minus tip for a three course meal (we shared starter and dessert). My only negative comment is about the Arabic bread which they serve in a plastic bag. I know this is suppose to keep the bread fresh but I don't need to see it.. please don't serve bread in a plastic bag, it takes away from the whole charm of the meal. I would highly recommend you try this restaurant, it is a treat and tribute to Syria's rich and diverse cuisine.."

The decor is pleasant + simple, the service was pretty good and the food definitely tasty. We started w/ the eggplant muttabal, followed by, I think (this was a few weeks ago) the Fette Maklous. Both delicious. Not much of a wine list, that could use some sprucing up. not sure if i would recommend this place or not, its a tad bit over priced."

My friends and I were in the restaurant side tonight for dinner. We shared the kibbeh nayya (raw beef with spices and pita) and it was delicious. Then each of us got a main dish - I had the kefta with pomegranate (grilled beef with a pomegranate sauce) - it was delicious! I warn you ahead that it was very rich, but very good. One of my friends had a kefta moussaka and it was also flavorful and very good, but lighter in flavor. My other friend had a eggplant and lamb dish which was also delicious.All in all it was a great dining experience, the food was excellent! I have had Persian, Lebanese and other middle eastern/mediterranean food and this was on par. Would definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place has been opened for about 6 months I think, in place of ""La Cantine"" which closed almost a year ago. I was excited to try Syrian food with my friends, and walking in on a Friday night around 8pm, we were happy to see that they had many empty tables. Now I know why. After we sat down and ordered, the waiter says that they are extremely busy tonight because they use the kitchen for both this restaurant and the one next door, and the latter was quite busy and that we had to expect a slow service because he was alone dealing with both restaurants. (Thanks for letting us know after we ordered...!) We waited about 1 hour 15 minutes for our meal. He only thought about giving us bread when we asked for it, already about 1 hour through our wait time. However, he also gave us olives and a tasty beet dip for free to compensate for the wait. The Libanese wine was good. Most of us ate traditional Fatté dishes, which were good (it's a layered dish: rice, fried pita, meat or veggies, yogourt, nuts, pomegranate, cilantro). But we found it was a bit expensive for what we got, and we were a bit turned off by the wait. I would be open to going back and try something else on the menu; if the food is still good and the service is more efficient, I'll be willing to give 3 stars."

It was hard to pick as everything sounded good. The restaurant was a bit empty, which is to be expected on a sunday but honestly made the experience more enjoyable. It's a small cozy place and the food was great. Absolutely no complaints here. On a snowy cold sunday, this place offered great food, a nice glass of Arak, a warm ambiance and great service. I look forward to coming back."
