/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Came here for my best friends birthday brunch. Reservations were pretty easy to make online. It was a chillier day so it wasn't really necessary but normally on sunny days I feel like they are busy. I had ab Eggs Benedict and instead of the meat that came with it I asked for a veggie and they gave me asparagus sliced. Which was AMAZING because it was so easy to cut and eat. We ordered a couple bottles of bubbles for mimosa. They come with fresh juice and you can even get fresh raspberries pure.  Very decently priced. The staff was very pleasant and attentive.If you are afraid of bees make sure you sit away from the plants. We sat in the corner and there was six just chilling in our life as we were beside the plants in the corner. No big deal but one of our friends wasn't overly thrilled. The tables and chairs are comfortable and you have a pretty view of the church.

Food was good, but the desserts were better ( thank you to our waiter who brought out my friend's dessert with the sparkler). Overall decent experience , might return to try the brunch .Ps. The covid protocol in this restaurant is great !"

I tried the  wild mushroom vol-au-vent, the bavette steak as well as the panna cotta. The food was delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly. The panna cotta wasn't too sweet. The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and funny and made good suggestions. Would definitely come back."

/user_details?userid=HNrz6Xe7PoLjUp8kBUDykQ,Nick B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The table d'hôte brunch was a decent value, and we did have nice but slightly chilly day on the terrasse. While the eggs benny were not the best I've had, they were nevertheless good, and it was really the service that made things stand out for the most part - particularly one young gentleman who was very much on his toes with the mimosa pitcher for those partaking. The interior, where we probably should have sat, is a really beautiful space inside the Hotel Place D'Armes, and was worth a walk through."
/user_details?userid=ZiWBXSRyUF-A1Q89zrh1Iw,Marcus C.,"Clearwater, FL",4 star rating,Brasserie 701 was really good. The service was good and our server Nadia was exceptional. She provided thoughtful insight about the menu.They had a good drink menu and some tasty appetizers as well. The Lobster tail grits were delicious and surprisingly not too heavy. Creme brûlée for dessert is never a bad idea.I'd definitely return if I come back to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=7AZwH142qByRsLlai-2OBw,Emily J.,"Alhambra, CA",5 star rating,"Our last night in Montreal ended on a high note because of our dinner here. Everything we ordered was spectacular and artfully presented. The bonus is we were sat diagonal from the Notre Dame Basilica which was decorated in lots of pretty Christmas lights. The ambiance inside the restaurant was cozy, romantic, and classy. Indoor and outdoor was just complete eye candy that night with fresh snow on the ground.   What we ordered: 6 New Brunswick oysters on the half shell (A) - Crisp, fresh, and briny. Could be larger in size MILLE-FEUILLE DE LÉGUMES GRILLÉES (A+)- Surprisingly inventive dish with the Mille-Feuille on top to soak all the vegetable sauce6 ESCARGOTS EN COQUILLE (A)- It's very difficult to find this particular dish in Quebec for some odd reason. I think the labor of stuffing the snails inside the shells take time but the interactive experience is what makes this dish so worth the hassle if you're not refined in picking the snail with those metal tongs. I've not mastered the technique but I did not use my hands this time! I powered through and got them all out without flinging one to our next door neighbor! Flavors were good but the snail could be more tender.FOIE GRAS DU QUÉBEC MI-CUIT (A+) - We had a lot of Foie Gras in our lifetime and this was comparable to the ones we had in France and Prague. Buttery and smooth without the iron aftertaste makes this dish stand outRAVIOLIS FARCIS AUX CHAMPIGNONS (A+)- It's all about the sauce and texture! The sauce was addictive and the pasta cooked to perfection. This dish was so good we licked everything off our plate. Our neighbor saw that we cleaned this plate up and ordered a dish for themselves too! Lol they ending up liking it as much as we did and ordered another! That's how good this pasta is. It looks simple but packs a flavorful punch! PARIS-BREST BRASSERIE 701 (A+) - We rarely order dessert because we are always full but since everything we had up to that point was so amazing we had to see what their dessert would taste like. This is their signature dessert and it blew us away. We made room for this baby and may I say the cream puffs were so delectable and not overly sweet with the hazelnut cream. Still dreaming about this...Hope the menu doesn't change too much as I will definitely be back on my next flight into Montreal JUST for this restaurant. Parking is free after 9pm on Thurs and there is some paid  street parking in front of the Basilica."
/user_details?userid=CKGp1MGRjqPFheWXprJC9g,Ziv H.,"Charlottesville, VA",3 star rating,"It's hip, buzzing, and on a hot corner. Upscale decor and a visible fashionable crowd. There to impress and be seen, a corner from the Basilica.  Hoping for the puttanesca, but it was brunch hour. Fun to hang out, people watching for sure.Food? 40 minutes after finally ordering, nary a note from the waitstaff; flagged one who got ours to come over finally, and announce that Sorry the Kitchen is backed up.  Bread, anything, hungerrrr--think JoelGreyInCabaret-- sorry we have none.   How about a mimosa.The food was good, certainly. But we ate it in seconds at that point.The waiters, it's a gig, The chef's management that day? Shabby. Tone is set from the top.And does leave a lingering taste-- despite the tasty and tres cher burger."
/user_details?userid=lgsiRGBbD10ZgaW-M9uEmQ,Adam S.,"Culver City, CA",4 star rating,"Outdoor seating in the midst-of-summer is key! This, along with a cooling breeze, is what makes my review possible.No photos, no fanfare, Brasserie 701 is simply the 1st Floor restaurant in our hotel, the Hotel Place d'Armes. Sensing the AC chill inside the restaurant, we ask to move outdoors. Located in a sidewalk slope, the patio allows for good views of foot-traffic towards the Notre Dame Basilica. Furtheremore, one incredible dish makes Brasserie worth a re-visit:First, this plate has a name that when pronounced properly produces utter elation in the frontal lobe, ""mille-feuille."" Second, it's as foreign-looking as it sounds. Layered Phyllo dough baked to crisp perfection sandwiches cooked colorful vegetables, cherry tomatoes, herbs, and melting goat cheese. Third, the taste. Warm, crispy and at times cool, sweet, savory. Like a pizza from the heavens above, this is what the divine hand brings to dough and veggies. It's the most popular dish at our table for a reason. I may only one item to recommend, but that's OK when it can blow you away. When I dream of Montreal, there's a good chance I include Brasserie's Vegetable Mille-feuille."

Plants, loud spanish music, lights, beautiful view ofthe city. However, the food was pretty disappointing. We came here for brunch, the menu was very limited with not that many options. To begin with, my mother had ordered the ""Bavette de Boeuf"" which is the flank steak. The steak was very good, but it was very little.It was $29.00 for a tiny piece of meat. The veggies were good too. What was truly disappointing was the ""Eggs Benedict"". It was very bland, lacked seasoning. The English muffin was so HARD and CRISPY when it's supposed to be soft and buttery. The egg was FULLY cooked and that's not at all how the poached egg is supposed to be. The potatoes were dry and salty. The mimosas were $10 each and they were alright, I've had better. The prices and the portions are so off, it's sad. The service was slow but the staff was super friendly so I made sure to tip. Overall, I would not come back."

/user_details?userid=a_DzZ8Wtwn7sFhMb7yxLFA,Brenda A.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"Okay, look. Me, personally, I would give this place 4.5 stars. But my group of 12ish friends were NOT feeling it at all. Where shall we start?The place is beautiful, super chic and modern. But, we are a little late and the first thing they tell us is that our table can only be sat for 2 hours. Okay, fine. So we are ready to order and the waitress could not be found. We finally order. Some friends do the bottomless mimosa and complain for the whole brunch about how their refills don't come fast enough (which I agree with). The food comes out. Just get what I had. The two eggs. It's like the cheapest option and so perfect. I had eggs, mustard caviar, hummus, toast, beans (so freaking good!), Canadian bacon, sausage. I was so full and it was so good. My friends got Benedicts, chicken and waffles. And they had so many issues with hollandaise sauce and other sauces missing. It was a mess. The manager came out with a round of shots for us, but I think by that time everyone was already over it. I just think they couldn't handle a group our size. But. The food--at least my food was sooooo good."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I came here with my girlfriends on a weekend for brunch during mtl a table. The place was packed! I got the chicken waffles. It was good but it didn't come with sauce! I had to ask for syrup!! That's just crazy to me. It would have been pretty dry otherwise. My friend and I got the bottomless mimosas. It was so worth it because we pretty much drank a bottle of bubbly between the two of us and it would have cost way more! Also Benoit from Bachelors in Paradise and winter games works here! He was nice enough to take a picture with us! Ladies he's better looking in person! ;)

Brasserie 701 was always on my try list for brunch. Somehow, my time never works out. Here we are for a dinner. When I arrived I was greeted by a friendliest hostess. She took our jacket and inserted them in the closet. When we went in, I was mesmerized by the decor of this beautiful restaurant. We are seated at a nice table. We were super excited to order from the menu of the happening gourmand. Our waiter Fred was very amiable. and helpful.As my entree I got Sweet potato soup; oh my God it was wonderful. It was very creamy But light. It was really really delicious. As my main course, I got cod fish with delicious creamiest mashed potato. The fish was perfectly cooked. Then for dessert we got white cake with orange. Another beautiful and succulent creation.I was impressed by the service, the restaurant, the food, the decor and the ambience.  I can't wait to come back again."

Amazing idea to combine chicken,waffles, and hollandaise sauce. Came with potatoes too so all of my favorite non-sweet brunch items into one dish.Yum!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone!

I so badly wanted to like it here but it was the least enjoyable meal of our trip.The good:- the ambiance and decor was very well done and enjoyable- staff was very friendly and helpfulThe not so good:- Went for brunch with a friend. I got the chicken and waffles and she got the eggs benedict. Neither of us were impressed by our meals, at all. Everything just tasted sub par at best and we grew to be more and more dissatisfied with the quality. I do my very best to give places the benefit of the doubt even if I don't love my meal, but this was beyond what I could overlook. The chicken was dry and breading wouldn't stick at all. Everything else was bland. The only thing we could both agree on was that with some salt, the potatoes were fine.- We never actually knew who our waiter was. We were served by a different person for water, drinks, meals, and cleaning up our plates. Felt awkward when leaving a tip because we didn't know who we were tipping. However, like I said, everyone was very nice and helpful.I don't recommend coming here for brunch. Maybe lunch/dinner are better, but it will not be on my list for my next trip to Montreal :("
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went there with a group last week-end. The food was good, not mindblowingly so, but good. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great, the chicken good, and the portion a bit small. The service was... friendly but chaotic. They were understaff (they told us) and it showed. Many orders were forgotten. Errors on bills. The waiter was nice but not the most efficient.The ambiance is posh/pretentious and the price, and the crowd, reflects that.Overall it was an OK experience. I would go back, but there are better brunch options.Oh one last thing - it's not a great place for kids."

Couldn't get a seat upstairs if your life depended on it unless you want to stand around blocking people from going to the bathroom then by all means wait. We decided to use the small terasse out front which was still great, it was about to rain and got super windy so we left to go inside. They had a small table in the back but told us by 9:30 we would have to leave, we left before then anyways.Food was okay nothing crazy but I enjoyed it. Inside drinks were slow as they decided to make the easy ones first and do the ""hard ones"" after (old fashion, negroni)We changed waiters a lot so got a bit hard to communicate with them as nobody knew if our drinks were added or not or if someone was making them or not."

/user_details?userid=pg02c-ATWF3g7tY4WdPL_Q,Melissa G.,"Hampstead, Canada",2 star rating,"The costumer service was the worst I've ever seen in my life. We were given a gift card as a gift which clearly stated a dinner of two was complementary. This gift was provided and it did not state a limit. On the card it mentioned the value limit was ""N/A"".When we had presented our gift card they were very rude initially. We thought it would be no problem to be bringing it to the restaurant considering it was on a Monday night. When the waiter  came over and mentioned that our gift card had a limit of $100, we were surprised because our friend had also received that gift card the previous week and they had told her it's unlimited food. We asked to speak to the manager, who ended up coming 20 mins later to only tell us that he couldn't make executive decisions. He then proceeded to stay that his higher management wasn't present and I had to insist that he get us on the phone. Right as our food comes, we got on the phone with him. He was disrespectful and completely out of line. He started counting the price on the menu to determine how much we had accumulated so far to decide whether he would grant us our dinner without a limit. Keep in mind we had ordered only 1 appetizer to share and two main courses. The phone call ended and I hung up out of frustration that they are fighting with a customer over what could be 10-15$ extra. Turns out the meal ended up being less than $100 and so their fighting turned out to be useless and they lost two customers who will never return. VERY very DISSAPOINTEDThe food was good (the ravioli) but the service ruined my evening"

The restaurant was pretty fancy and there are cool art pieces on the walls around the restaurant. The good unfortunately ends there.Our waitress was cold and was not friendly, the bread was cold and the portions of food were minuscule. We had the shrimp brochette as an appetizer and they were dry and not very good. The sauce that it came with was good but the portion of it was not enough.For mains, we had the steak and the cod. Both were pretty tasty but for 38$, the steak was tiny. I would have given this restaurant a 3 to 4 if it weren't for the terrible service."

The location itself is walking distance from the metro and it is beautiful inside , high ceilings and beautiful elegant decor. Service was a little awkward , our server seemed like he was making an attempt at being friendly in a way but wasn't really smiling and kind of seemed annoyed to even have to take our order or answer any questions about the menu, he also never really came to check on us after we got our plates.  I ordered a grapefruit mimosa and the eggs Benedict , it came with fruit and potatoes. The food was very well prepared and tasted good , lots of silky yolk in the eggs which was great and the hollandaise sauce tasted very good , the cheese was sharp and tasty , all in all very enjoyable . Keep in mind the brunch menu is not very extensive so maybe not the best idea to come with a picky eater. The price was okay. The mimosa was okay10$ ,very small and didn't seem like it had much alcohol inside - they offer bottomless mimosas for 30$.  This wasn't a horrible experience but I can't say this was my favourite."

Our server came back after our ordering tonight; she forgot the order. She then brought the larger size appetizers (beef tartare and antipasti) when we ordered the smaller size. Upon receiving the bill there was an extra charge for a 9 oz Malbec we never ordered or received. She said oh there is no Malbec. Not very friendly also.

The restaurant also had an express lunch menu (about 4 items) if you need to receive your meal quickly - guaranteed in 45 minutes or less. Otherwise, there was a moderate selection of a la carte entrees, sides and desserts.  The food was very light and we were able to eat a 3 course meal without feeling miserable or stuffed. There was also a nice selection of international wines.  I had the local Canadian Chardonnay and it was very good. Overall, I had a positive experience here."

The food was tasty, so that's why it earned my 3 stars. But the server we had just didn't seem to care. Had to ask for every refill, had to ask that used/empty plates be removed from the table. At the end he totally overcharged us and initially tried to act like it was our fault somehow? Uhh, no. TLDR: stay at the hotel, food here is good but the restaurant service isn't."
/user_details?userid=QEC6X5psWXh2NT1wonGjLw,Andy L.,"Brampton, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here on a Saturday night, had to make a reservation for 630pm because everything after was already booked. It's a pretty fancy place, dress code is definitely business casual if not more so.While the food tasted great, there were a few things that stood out, and not in a good way. They start you off with bread, but ours wasn't even cut properly and was cold. It might just be how they serve it, but you would expect more from a place that looks this fancy. Then came our smoked duck carpaccio. It's supposed to come with celery chips, and we expected something  like a potato chip. Unfortunately, what we got were more the size of pennies; one look at their Instagram account and you'll see what it should look like vs. what we got. At the time though, it was delicious. For our mains we got the seared scallops risotto and drunken chicken w/ gnocchi. Scallops - excellent. Risotto - good, but felt like we had better. It was a tad on the runny side and the rice was past the point of al dente, so not enough bite. Drunken chicken was superb - something I definitely recommend. Gnocchi was light and fluffy.The creme brulee was okay, a good way to end the meal, but nothing out of the ordinary. A nice place to socialize, but I feel if you're looking for a quality meal you could find it elsewhere."

It is covered in what tasted exactly like a pizza sauce rather than a marinara. No vegetable served with the gnocchi either. Overall unimaginative experience."
/user_details?userid=kMXPkvGLJBLgkZVLPQmSlw,Marianne D.,"Naperville, IL",5 star rating,"Suite 701 is located in Le Place d'Armes Hotel. It's a trendy restaurant with a bar and tables, some being located near the fireplace which is where we sat. The servers the night we dined here were two girls that were dressed in shocking pink dresses which were above the standard-type uniform. Our server, Rachel, was sweet and friendly. She and another server, Alison, were attentive and chatted with us and made us feel welcomed. We were given a very little loaf of bread (3 thin slices) and soft butter upon seating. I thought the restaurant was a little skimpy with the bread as we each had 1 1/2 little pieces, having to split the third slice of bread. There's a good variety of cocktails and wine. I had a prosecco and my husband a Chianti.  We decided to split three appetizers for our dinner since we decided we were going to scale back a bit from our heavier meals in Montreal.  Suite 701 has a new chef within the last few months and he does an outstanding job creating both visually-pleasing plates and food that takes your palate on a journey. The Niçoise salad was deconstructed with seared rare tuna, haricot verts, grape tomatoes, olives, soft boiled egg and arugula. I never had a Niçoise served this way. The soft boiled egg had a panko crust and with the beans provided a nice crunch texture to this salad while the olives added the salt and the tuna...it melted in my mouth. The deer mini burgers came as three tiny burgers with lettuce and tomatoes and some sort of aioli. The deer meat unfortunately was dry and overcooked. Deer should be served medium rare and it probably was difficult to accomplish that with the size of the patty. My husband did like them...I didn't. The presentation, however, like the Niçoise was spot on. We then had the smoked duck carpaccio...OMG!!  By far the best smoked duck ever. This was served with an arugula salad. Again, the taste and presentation was fabulous. It was smokey and tender.  We decided since we were enjoying our dining experience to stay for an after dinner port and a piece of their carrot cake. The carrot cake was amazing...light, moist and again the presentation was great. There was a thin layer of carrot cake and then a light cream cheese mousse and then crumbled carrot cake on top. It was like the frosting was in the middle of the cake, but the traditional cream cheese frosting was made into an airy delightful mousse. I'm a hobbyist cupcake baker and am re-creating this into a cupcake.  I highly recommend Suite 701 for the ambiance, the great service and the creative delicious food.  I'm giving it a five-star rating even with the miss on the bread and dry deer meat because everything else exceeded my expectations."

I came here for dinner after the girlfriend suggested we dine here for Happening Gourmand.The good aspects are the Beautiful decor, fantastic location by Place D'Armes metro, and really good ambiance. We had really good service from the get go. Firstly, the entree was delicious: goat cheese, spinach and roasted red peppers and garlic confit. Nice presentation (as expected from restaurants like this) and even better taste. 10 on 10 would order that again. The dessert was probably top 3 brownies I've ever had. Moist, rich and not too sweet, it was definitely another winner.I wouldn't say the main plate was bad, but it was definitely underwhelming. We have the smoked pan-seared king fish with quinoa and salsa. While at a glance it looks nicely plated, the taste is not noteworthy. It resembled a high end version of a typical meal prep. The fish was a bit dry, the skin was over salted, it just did nothing for me. The quinoa was a bit soggy and really didn't fit the the luxe vibe of everything on the menu.I was impressed with 2/3 items on the menu, so I would come back again. The girlfriend speaks highly of the food here, so maybe I just had really high expectations."

This resto/lounge/bar is located in a beautiful classical building in the Old Port who's tall ceilings and chandeliers have been revved up with pink lighting and a dj booth. A frankly refreshing break from the tired trope of uber-industrial decor plaguing the upscale food scene, no Edison bulb or exposed piping can be found in sight! My party came in on a Wednesday night at around 8pm and this is where my only complaint lies- the music was inexplicably loud. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we were shouting over the table at one another but we definitely needed to strain ourselves to keep up conversation. Like I said though, this is the only part of the experience that warrants a complaint!  Now in regards to the meal... WOW. It was really great. Everything we ordered was so delicious and well-prepared! The timing between courses was also pretty reasonable and the staff were knowledgable and attentive. I wish I would have had the chance to try some of their drinks, since the cocktails looks sooo good, but it just wasn't that kind of night. They definitely provide an incentive to come back again though!Final verdict/ parting advice: this place is definitely worth checking out but perhaps not in a group larger than 4 (unless they decide to turn down the music a bit). Also, they offer BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH(!!!!) on weekends. Also, I hear they have a beautiful terrasse in the summer that is a must-see! In my opinion, these are all very good reasons to give it a try and for me to go back in the future."

Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...On the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen). In fact, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates - very unusual."

The appetizers we tried were mostly OK (the foie gras was the star, even though it was quite salty, and the charcuterie plate also very good though very overpriced). Main course was a disappointment all around, especially the scallop plate which, for 28$, consisted of 5 small scallops, 4 cherry tomatoes and a couple greens. Dessert was decent though our coffee never made it to the table. The drinks were for the most part very good and are the only reason this is not a 1 star review, though for that price you are much better off going somewhere else (the outdoor terasse on the roof of the same building is a better option for drinks and has a great view)Pros: cool decor, friendly staff, nice bathroomsCons: food quality, portion size, price, service"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"For my second Happening Gourmand meal of the year, I found myself at Suite 701 in the Place d'Armes Hotel - a place I have gone by numerous times over the past few years without trying it and a spot that I will be revisiting shortly for my best friend's wedding. Regardless, one of my friends was sufficiently intrigued by the table d'hôte that he organized a lovely Saturday night meal - and I am certainly not one to say no to that!Suite 701 is probably best described as a lounge with a full dinner menu - the decor and ambience is certainly more lounge in nature. High ceilings with ornate mouldings, huge windows with large drap-like curtains, beautiful wooden tables and chairs with a few leather banquettes, a glorious long bar, low lighting using mostly chandeliers outside of the purple accent lights, the otherwise all white color palette... Suite 701 is definitely a looker. The live DJ - playing for the most part great old R&amp;B/ soul music - was definitely too loud though. When it is hard to hear the conversation at the other end of 5 person table, you are probably a little too close to bar/supper club territory than you should be as a lounge.Menu-wise, Suite 701 describes itself as modern brasserie which, when I see that, strikes me as a catch all term for a menu that is quite varied. That seems to fit the bill here - the menu was definitely interesting but an strange mix of dishes. First up, the table ordered two platters of their homemade charcuterie with mustard, grilled chorizo, deviled eggs and chipotle dill pickle. A nice mixture of blood sausage, porchetta, salami and prosciutto. You can never go wrong with good charcuterie.Next, I got to try the organic salmon tartar with celery leaves, granny smith apples, grapefruit and mild wasabi cream. Presentation was nice as was the execution. I hate grapefruit so while I understand the desire to add some citrus to the tartar, I wish it had been something different. The fish was nice and fresh with every other element working well for the dish. I particularly enjoyed the subtle heat from the wasabi cream.The other starter I got to try was the roasted eggplant, tomato confit and marinated zucchini pissaladière. None of us had any idea what a pissaladiere was... but we figured why not? The rest of the dish description seemed worth a try. Ended up looking like a spring roll - which isn't what a pissaladiere is according to my web searches but regardless - and tasted pretty good. The pastry was nice and flaky and the eggplant/zucchini combo had great flavour.Moving on to mains. I could not resist the duck so I went with the duck magret with pomegranate gastrique, charred farro risotto and braised kale. The duck was perfect - rich and fatty, cooked rare as it needs to be. The risotto however was a bit off to my liking. The use of farro, unknown to me prior to this, instead of rice was interesting but created a much firmer texture to the risotto than I was expected - I will mark this down to wrong expectations on my end.The other main I tried was the pan-seared black bass with Jerusalem artichoke purée, black olive sauce and braised endives. The black bass was beautifully flaky and slightly salty. The artichoke puree and endives paired nicely to the fish. I skipped the sauce as olives really aren't my thing.Dessert-wise, there were two options - a mocha cake with blood orange compote and a white chocolate mousse with raspberries. I hate mocha so I didn't try it but it seemed to be a hit at the table. My choice was the mousse which was well executed texturally - wonderfully smooth - but good lord was it sweet... too sweet to be honest which is saying a lot coming for a guy who absolutely loves his desserts. The tartness of the raspberries were not enough to offset the sweetness here. It almost needed a cookie or dark chocolate bites to offset the extra sweetness.Suite 701 was a nice evening overall with a few minor issues that didn't make it an amazing one food wise. I definitely see coming back for a cocktail hour with a bite or two - which ironically is what will happen at that wedding I mentioned earlier - but I don't have a strong desire to return for a full dinner. For a lounge, that is what one would expect so on that account, Suite 701 probably hits its objective. Worth considerable to start an evening in Old Montreal at the very least.Cheers!"

Got into Montreal late and so decided to just come here to grab a bite to eat because it was easy.  I was seriously underwhelmed.  With all the good food in Montreal, this place cannot get away with charging the prices they do for mediocre food and drinks.  Had the duck wings which I suspect we're actually turkey (dry), the beet salad with shrimp (blech) and the crab cake, which was the best part of the meal.  Drinks were overly sweet.Not worth it."

The staff is friendly and quick with orders. The ambience and decor is upscale and clean.CONS: The DJ. I'm sorry but whomever hired this person to spin some beats is wasting their money. For one the DJ is not dressed appropriately (white tee and jeans). He also plays outdated music which he plays on a pre-made playlist while he sits and messes on his phone. And sometimes the songs just repeat which shows how little attention he paid. I've been to venues where the DJ can make or break a night out. This one definitely BREAKS."

I was instead given a flakey abomination garnished with whip cream.- Decor would be considered classy only at a sweet 16 (I might just be bitter)- Food prices were way too high considering its qualityOverall:Establishing good drink recipes is fine if you're just a bar but it doesn't cut it for dinner service. Though ambitions were high on all 3 courses, the execution was very poor and couldn't be saved even with fancy ingredients. I wouldn't have cared if my salmon was Irish, Spanish or Philipino, I just didn't expect to be eating it still squishy. My date, not wanting to ruin our anniversary, politely ate her food but felt ill afterwards from the overwhelming amounts of salt and parm in her risotto. Suite 701 is best described as fancy-style food. You're paying a premium for being in a large location in Old Montreal, attached to a hotel and served food on large, ornate plates. I'd like to say that I'll give them another try in case it was a temporary screw up but, with their pricing, it's not a gamble I'd be willing take."

/user_details?userid=Ckn3g0lDS1Cf-X3PW7-uOg,Vlad M.,"Newmarket, Canada",2 star rating,"Went here on a Saturday. It was the only place open for the weekend for lunch near our hotel. Almost all restaurants on the weekend open at around 5PM. If you're going into the old part of town for breakfast and lunch on the weekend, think again. You won't find a place open. It might be different for the surrounding suburbs, but not in downtown. A high contrast with Toronto where places are open all day on the weekend.Location is very nice. We got a table outside with a view of the basilica and plaza in front of it.They were not busy, but service was SLOW. We ordered drinks and got them 30 minutes later food came 40 minutes into our stop, and it was only a charcuterie plate. So it took them 40 minutes to cut some deli and put it on a cutting board. They did not look understaffed.We were given menus from the hostess, only to be told by the waiter that we were given the wrong menus, for brunch, when they had already stopped serving brunch. So he brought us the right menu. Once we made our selections and were ready to order, we were told that they could only serve 2 items from the menu, the cheese platter and the charcuterie platter. So I guess their chef must have called in or something. Very disappointed. But since it was the only place open, we ordered the charcuterie plate.And waited .... and waited ... and finally, 40 minutes later, out comes the charcuterie plate.The food was quite delicious and the beer was not bad either, though they had very limited selection on alcohol as well.The service was quite nice and attentive, but again, VERY SLOW.Would I come back to this place? Probably not. But if you're laid back and like the view, and you don't mind waiting a VERY long time to get your order, you might want to give it a try. It's one of the very very few places open on a weekend for lunch in the old Montreal area, so it's not like you have many choices. If not, best stick to your hotel's restaurant, because chances are you won't find anything better around there."

The music wasn't too loud on the terrasse either making it easy to talk to others.Their drinks are on the expensive side so this is somewhere you visit once in a while.  I had a rasberry mojito which would have been good had they not added so much lime which was overpowering.  The Jazz martini was better and both drinks did contain a decent amount of alcohol however I still think they were overpriced.

The food was good and seemed average priced for the area.  The french toast was good and the coffee was reasonably strong and they did a good job of keeping my cup filled.  The cheeses were good, but I think it was priced a little high for what I received."

Looks like a nice place but Glasses were dirty, the waitress cleaned my plate in front of me with the napkin she then handed to me to use (so gross!), and then food took quite a while but there were not many people there. Wouldn't go back."

Just like our server's head.Nice decor. Drinks are very good, but not the best."
/user_details?userid=WAHkIQyauNFHYxlzb9MrLg,Shannon F.,"Saint Albans City, VT",2 star rating,"As a guest of Hotel Place D'armes I was pleased to see such a beautiful bar/restaurant located within the hotel.  My first night at the hotel we went to the bar at Brasserie 701 for post dinner drinks and dessert.  We were pleased with the bar staff service as well as the desserts ordered.  Being so pleased with this experience we decided to try Brasserie 701 for dinner the following evening.  What a disappointment!  We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was less than half full and the host asked us if we had a reservation, we stated ""no"" and he asked if we would be gone by 8:30, we stated yes.  I regret not simply taking a seat at the bar because we received the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  If they didn't want us there due to expectant reservations the host should have simply stated that they were only accommodating reservations.  Although, in the time we were there people only left and very few new patrons came into the restaurant.  During our meal we had a handful of waiters, no one checked to see how our meals were, and no one asked once if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  Too bad, if service had been better we would've ordered dessert and more drinks.  When one of our waiters finally showed up to refill the waters, we asked for the bill.  If it wasn't for the good food I would have given this place a 1.  Food was delicious and I have nothing negative to say about our meals, unfortunately I can't say the same for this poorly run restaurant filled with terrible wait staff."
/user_details?userid=u3DmS2s7yqNKB1cOpAzqHQ,Brittany D.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"So after seeing a couple churches in a row, I start to get thirsty. It works every time. Lucky for me, it was the first weekend of the season that the Suite 701 rooftop bar was open, which is ranked one of the top 10 rooftop bars in all of Montreal (I don't know which ranking but I agree with it). It was a perfect day for it, a high of 70 degrees and super sunny. On the rooftop there were couples in jeans, a table of businessmen in suits who must've been sweating their asses off, and a large group of girls dressed up like they were going to the prom with fake eyelashes and the other 8 yards. We got a bottle of Chardonnay and relaxed for several moments.The service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant. Overall a great place to be on a sunny day."

/user_details?userid=BwjjNBJWiBrAnJOWf1-apQ,Sandra M.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,Went for brunch and the food was fantastic. The service was quite slow but very friendly. The decor is beautiful. One major negative point was the volume of the music...much too loud. Very enjoyable experience.
/user_details?userid=5LnBLpyVvruKazXxiyDCqQ,Alan G.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"If the food comes, it is very good We had a 1PM brunch reservation and were seated within a few mins. The waiter came over promptly asking about drinks order. The restaurant was a mostly full brunch crowd with some open seats Around 1:15-1:20 the waiter came to take our order. We ordered a small share plate to start before our main brunch courses. It was a good thing that we told him to bring that first because our food did not show up for about an hour. The starter showed up in a reasonable time. However, that was the last we saw of food for a long time. The waiter kept on saying, within 10 mins. The people around us who were seated after us got their food, some finished and left. At 40 mins, I started really inquiring. Supposedly they checked in the kitchen...soon. At 50 mins, it was time to move on. I asked the hostess how long should it take to get a meal, she said about 30 mins when busy. I said, this has been 50 mins. It's time to leave. I was looking for our waiter and the Maitre d' to tell them to just forget it. Within a few mins, they appeared with our food giving up the choice to either leave or take the food at no cost. We graciously took the food. Admittedly, it was very good. Everything was delicious. The pulled pork wrap was superior. The crepes were excellent as were the waffles and eggs Benedict. I am not sure if it was worth an hour's wait but the restaurant did make up for their shortfall We will probably go back but we will be on guard for our food."
/user_details?userid=iBOv_uPu3C6aJACaP9iLjw,Tony S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Horrible horrible horrible, ordered a Blueberry Blast Martini which was good however so many wasps flying around and one dive bombed into my drink. The waitress just scooped it out and gave me back the drink. Waitress was miserable if she tried to smile I am sure her face would have broken in half. Food was comparable to a hospital. If you want to go for drinks it's great. However food and service leaves much to be desired. Given the amount of wasps flying around they really like the place!"

The first time, the service was perfect (the waiters were quick and so nice!), maybe because it was on a week day. The second time, it was a disaster, we went there on a friday night, the waitress asked us to move because the table was finally reserved, and none of them was at least polite.Also, while the view is outstanding to me, the drinks are quite expensive (15$ for a mojito)."
/user_details?userid=p9O64PrGuHCHl-nr0xtP6g,Rob K.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",1 star rating,"My wife and I went to this place on a Friday night based on Yelp reviews and were severely disappointed. We were prepared for it to be too loud and overpriced, but we thought in exchange we would get well made cocktails. How wrong we were.First, my wife had to explain to the bartender how to make a brandy alexander. Then when I asked the bartender what types of bourbon they had (because I wanted a manhattan), she had to check. I watched her go over to the bar, pull out a bottle and ask another bartender if it was in fact bourbon. She then came over and told me that all they had was Jim Beam. Either this large bar had an awful bourbon selection or our bartender had no idea what she was looking for. Either way, that's no good.When we actually got our drinks, they tasted alright. The only problem was that our martini glasses were not fully chilled, half full and my wife's Brandy Alexander was missing nutmeg after she told the bartender all the ingredients. This is may sound like a lot to ask for, but I expect full service at ten dollars a drink.So in review: loud, overpriced, undersized, understocked and staffed by unskilled bartenders. Do not go if you're looking for a good cocktail."
/user_details?userid=d0kRM0VMgVytJ2g3o7iLSQ,Kasia P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A couple of my girlfriends and I decided to try this 'trendier' restaurant in the Old Port. We expected the prices for food and drinks to be a bit higher than on average, but we also expected the service to be up to par as well. Great food, but awful service. The gentleman who was serving us apparently did not want us to enjoy the lounge's exquisite drink list, because he walked away with all the drink menus after we order our initial beverage. Once we got the drink menu back, not once on his own did he ask us if we wanted to re-order. Couple more hiccups throughout the meal: wrong order, lacking utensils etc. Not at all what we expected at a restaurant which advertises as having "" wonderful service in an uplifting setting."" Overall, ok ambiance, good food, but again, very poor service. As my friend put it ""Eating in a restaurant where you're paying over $10 per drink, my straw should have never hit the bottom of my glass."" Consensus among my friends: we will not be returning."

/user_details?userid=XbKuYuxXRLhOVmM9XNqehg,Caroline H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was very happy with my first experience here, at the lounge upstairs. I thought I would be as glad to be back for the restaurant. The decor is very exciting and all; it looks super chic and upscale. Although, for one of the first times in my life, I have to comment on the service, which was unforgivable. Everything was first of all so terribly  slow. I get that this is more of a bar, but having water every hour is unacceptable. And I hope our waiters were new... They kept on bringing the plates to the wrong people at the table which gets annoying... And when we had to complain about the quality of the food, the manager was condescending and impolite. I don't know about you but I don't like to be treated as if I was stupid. It's not because you get a complaint that you have to be rude. And laughing at it with your employees is insulting.  It's a shame because the food is actually pretty decent, but I can't stand poor service so I don't recommend this restaurant, at all."
