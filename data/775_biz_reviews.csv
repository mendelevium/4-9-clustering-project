/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",5 star rating,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. The owner was very friendly. And the breakfast food was super good. I ordered the large eggs, meat, and potatoes. The potatoes were slightly less crisp and executed than I prefer. But, still they were well-seasoned and tasty enough. The eggs and toast were buttery and well-executed. The meat I honestly don't remember, but I remember the whole meal as being very good."

/user_details?userid=74vZfW--4Ffi656KiEtYUg,James H.,"Providence, UT",5 star rating,"This place, and its owner Fade, are absolutely fantastic.We walked in having been roundly ignored down the road at St. Hubert. Having struck out and chicken, we went with eggs instead. Fade whipped up some great omelettes...and I mean great...exactly as we ordered them.We sat for a time having dinner and watching the world go by outside, then decided to stick around for a little longer. We had flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was superb too.The food was all great, but it was the vibe of the place and the kindness of Fade that made it worthwhile. He told us he was from Lebanon, and in Montreal for 25 years now. His English was great, and his French seemed to be too, given what I heard of it with the others in the place. This was the first time in a bunch of days in Montreal that anyone tried to make me feel at home, though, and I appreciated it beyond measure.You should come here if you have the chance. Tell Fade the two Marillion fans in town for the weekend recommended it."
/user_details?userid=xsq3s4YK_ACt_aSjWoKH8w,Mack M.,"Swartz Creek, MI",5 star rating,Wow! This quaint little shop serves a mean omelette and even better crepes!  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The staff is very friendly and service is excellent.

/user_details?userid=B0Xxo-DtDejGVHQccS1iiA,Raina A.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Thanks to Yelp and it's ability to filter restaurants by proximity we were able to find this spot very near to where we were staying for the weekend!It's located right across from a McDonald's and is situated at the corner of the street. My friend and I ordered the #4 which was a sandwich with egg, ham, tomato, lettuce and mayo on toasted white bread. The sandwich was tasty but a little overpriced at $6.95.  Our cashier was very patient with all the questions we asked and was prompt with her service. As far as the menu goes there is quite a selection but not much can be modified. Meaning there is only white bread for the sandwiches and one type of bagel, etc. We also ordered tea  she brought us a box of teabags to choose which tea and filled up a mini kettle of hot water. I tried the maple tea which was really yummy."

Yuck! Yuck!
/user_details?userid=G_FhyStKHtTJw9IwH-0Vbg,Vanessa R.,"Stockton, CA",5 star rating,"Cafe Lulu serves breakfast all day. The cafe staff was friendly and the service was quick. We had the special with eggs, toast, ham, fresh fruit, and coffee. I also got a toasted bagel (the Montréal-style bagel is one of the three foods tour guides recommended we try). All of the food was fresh and delicious. The outdoor seating area was great for people watching. Also, the cafe offers free WiFi."

/user_details?userid=BCp4aBWrDd5pMTynN1S9Og,Arnold T.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Staff is super helpful and friendly. She made my coffee drink that is not even on the menu. 1 shot of espresso and loads of foam milk in a large coffee mug. I really enjoyed this drink. We had the western omelette and it's didn't look that appetizing because there were no burnt spots on the the egg (it was pale to me) and the ham is not diced but after tasting it, I actually liked the flavor of it."

/user_details?userid=s1KRrtM9MTtFCODznt4vAA,Hy P.,"Ville-Marie, Canada",4 star rating,"Had the Lulu Special with a chocolate almond croissant. Here are my thoughts:- customer service was unbelievable- sausages were good but you only get two- potatoes were the worst part of the meal- if you like your toast with very little or no butter, you need to mention it because they put a lot - eggs were perfectly cooked- the croissant was solid- coffee was very good as wellPersonally I would suggest you go for the crepes instead. That seems like their specialty."

It's not a big place but they deliver great service!They have a big menu board with breakfast plates with eggs, fruit and toast, make omelettes on the spot, right in front of you.The coffee is great also. Free fruity water as well."

/user_details?userid=j_xTEYSkYkFNIKUx8j9vkQ,Des C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"If you're looking for a great breakfast spot - well look no further! Cafe Lulu had delicious food, a cozy ambiance, and hospitable staff. We were greeted as soon as we got in and once the gentleman behind the counter figured out we couldn't speak French, he gladly helped us out in explaining the menu. I had the Special Lulu with your choice of 2 eggs cooked your way, potatoes or fruits, dark or white multigrain toast, ham, and coffee. Everything was delicious and it was just enough so I wasn't overstuffed. The gentleman made sure we were well taken care of and made genuine conversation. Would highly recommend coming here!"

The coffee was fresh and delicious, and the omelettes made on the crepe slab were all amazing as well. Be aware that this will not be a quick breakfast if you have a group as each item is hand made by the one guy there with care. We thought it was worth it. All the ingredients were fresh and none of us had a complaint in the world."
