This is the most delicious, clean-tasting, authentic pho I've ever had in Montreal. I was already a loyal customer before, and will continue to be during Covid with their delivery. Generous portions with all the toppings. Fresh ingredients, authentic flavor... 10/10 for sure!"
/user_details?userid=MOOBu3osXdaNQjNN8UYusw,Chan N.,"Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Almost four years ago, my friends and I ate here after I looked up the resto to celebrate one of our friend's bdays. Boy, was I not disappointed by the taste, quality, and price, and so were my friends.I had eaten practically everything offered on the menu at home or at other Viet restaurants except Mỹ Cảnh's Mì la cay. I haven't found it at any other Viet restos in or outside the island.Mì la cay can be ordered with the soup on top of or beside the noodles. I still remember eating it four years ago, and it did not disappoint two weeks ago. The xá xíu (char siu pork) went along so well with the noodles and fried shrimp fritter and dried onions, not to mention what devil's seasoning is in the sauce I asked my mom about it, and she told me that it has Chinese influences and that the recipe is kept secret-no wonder I can't find it on the internet! I guess I'll just stop by Mỹ Cảnh every time I crave mì la cay."
/user_details?userid=nyl_1VcRIAyI55bb_scpdw,Mary T.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"After my first day of my workshop, I was hungry and ready for dinner. I went back to my hotel room to drop off my stuff, changed into a pair of shorts, put my hair up, and went out. The funny thing is that one of my colleagues from the workshop and I crossed paths moments later outside our hotel. I think he was shocked to see someone spot him in casual clothes and earbuds. As for me, I really don't look all that different in any setting.Anyway, I decided to give Chinatown a closer look and went back there for dinner. The first Vietnamese restaurant that I approached was My Canh. I looked at the menu. I saw pho. Perfect! I walked in.A man with tattoos on his arms greeted me. It was just me, so I got to choose any table for two by the wall. I chose number 14, as it's my lucky number. Hey, why not?I ordered the imperial rolls. I got the regular, meaning that there is pork in the two rolls. I also got a large bowl of pho, with rare beef and beef balls.I didn't wait long to get my food. Both the imperial rolls and pho came together. I took a chance and went with the former, which were piping hot!The imperial rolls were tasty. I liked the pork and vegetable filling. They were crunchy and yummy.My pho was delicious. The broth was flavourful and good. I got a decent number of beef balls that were cut in half. The rare beef was tender. The bean sprouts, mint, and squeeze of lime all went into my bowl of pho. It was so good! All my hunger pangs disappeared as I polished off my meal.I paid at the front counter with a credit card. All went well. Staff were friendly to me.I used the washroom. It was clean. There is a sign on the front door that says that you must be a customer to use it.I enjoyed my meal. I'd come back again to try more items off the menu.(313)"
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"My mom and I had lunch here and it was pretty good. I had the medium sized Phnom Penh Noodle Soup (aka Hi Tieu Nam Vang) $11.50. My mom had the medium sized ""Mi Lakay"" with the broth on the side $12.50. My noodle soup had 2 shrimps, some slices of pork, a slice of pork liver, 2 slices of pork heart, some ground pork, 2 slices of Cha Lua (Vietnamese ham, usually found in Banh Mi), fried shallots, and some tiny dried shrimps, with rice noodle. I was disappointed that it didn't come with tapioca noodles, as this dish is supposed to, but the rice noodles were satisfactory. I usually hate organ meats, but these slices were really thin, and didn't look gross and all organ-like, lol, so ate them, haha. They were ok. The broth was really fragrant, a bit too oily for my tastes (probably from the fried shallots), but really flavourful. I would have liked to have some vegetables in this dish, even though that's not the tradition, but hey, they already broke tradition with not using tapioca noodles, so why not add some Nappa cabbage or Bok Choy, right? ;)My mom's ""Mi Lakay"" was wheat noodles (the same type used traditionally in wonton noodle soup), BBQ pork slices, 2 shrimps, ground pork, a shrimp cracker, fried shallots, green onions and a leaf of lettuce. Since she got her soup on the side (aka dry style), they mixed a sauce into the noodles. This sauce was a bit oily and a bit salty, as per my mom. Nonetheless, she enjoyed her meal.Service was friendly and efficient. Our waters were refilled frequently, like topped up as soon as our glasses dipped below half - what service! :)There was a slight issue with my meal initially, for some reason they put wheat noodles in my soup instead of rice noodles. I noticed this as soon as they brought my bowl and notified them immediately. They were very apologetic and brought me my correct order promptly. Our orders usually come with bean sprouts, chili peppers and lime on the side, but we didn't want the 2 former items, so we just got limes. The restaurant is a very casual eatery with a cutlery caddy and condiments at each table. It's not fancy eats, but it's pretty tasty!Street parking only, since it's in Chinatown."
/user_details?userid=Ams0iLRd0AhZZectGKA8fw,Thanh N.,"Brampton, Canada",1 star rating,"Even though my meal was delicious and the best one I've ever order from any restaurants, the experience itself was not great at all.My boyfriend chose this restaurant because he noticed my favourite dish on the window of this restaurant. We walked in and were seated right away. Looking at their menu, I was boggled by the price, its above the average norm of a pho restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a pho which he was disappointed in, it was below average. I ordered a Banh Xeo which was bomb and extremely filling.And here is the horrible experience of it all: I kept hearing the female staff, the daughter of the owners using racial slurs, belittling customers and service staff in Vietnamese the entire time I was there. I couldn't help but get a little angry inside. I tried ignoring the whole situation but it was hard, I was in hearing distance of it all.The older gentlemen which worked there were all nice, bashful and productive.I wish I had read the reviews before coming here. I would have not gone after reading one about them turning away a service dog. Shows the type of people they are."

Passing by the window for hundreds of times, I finally decided to give it a try since I love vietnamien crepe. The crepe is 14$ what I think a bit higher than other places. The crepe was very crispy. I use the lettuce to wrap the crepe and mint. The taste was rich,crunchy and zesty with the sauce. Very tasty. Yummy... My husband had a beef pho. He thinks it's average.I also saw a group of seven girls ordered several General Tao chicken with rice. I bet that dish is pleasant too. Will come back to try other dishes."

I can't say it was great since I have tasted better Vietnamese pho elsewhere. But I think it was worth trying if you looking for different food in Chinatown.

The spring roll (pork, shrimp and vermicelli wrapped in rice paper) were freshly made pair with tasty peanuts sauce. The imperial is great, filled with chicken and shrimp, it comes with the usual fish sauce dipping but I prefer to pair it with peanuts sauces.Their pho are okay, too much MSG though and it made me super thirsty but taste not bad.They will need to work on their service, one of the waiter was completely on a cloud. The pho arrive but not the usual plate of chop suey and lime. So I asked him if he can bring me one, he said yes but instead of bring it to me, he prefer to clean 4 tables before bringing it to me. No smile, no apologies, rude."

My girlfriend was starving and I saw a picture of her favourite dish outside of this restaurant. We decided to come in for food, the items on the menu to me was overly priced compared the average norm. I ordered pho which was alright, below average; while my girlfriend ordered the Banh xeo. It was the best banh xeo she has ever ordered outside of family and friends. She could eat these for days and not fill full.While we were eating, my girlfriend couldn't help but listen to the staff members. The racist remarks towards people, belittling others, just mouth full of garbage. It came mainly from the female employees of the restaurant, while the male employees  mind their own business. My girlfriend may not be fluent in speaking but she can comprehend very well.No matter how great the food is, the service plays a huge part in the dining experience."

Try the Phnom Penh (Grounded Pork, Sliced Pork, Shrimps, sliced Vietnamese sausage, rice noodles and more) with the soup on the side start eating your dish without the soup and halfway pour the soup into your bowl of happiness for a great meal. The staff is friendly and the place is often packed with regulars because the food is great. Take out is also fast you order and it's ready in 10 minutes.

I think each time involved a combination of hunger, non ridiculous expectations/ sense of entitlement and excellent food. This place provided my most recent such epic experience with the best pho I've ever had!! Seriously this place is amazing! The broth was rich and delicious.  The noodles perfectly cooked. The meat...  Ooh the meat.  I've never had such tender delicious meat (no immature jokes please) in a bowl of pho before. Seriously it was like filet mignon. They must marinate it here and the meat must be of good quality for it to almost melt in your mouth with each bite. In comparison, here in New Jersey, even the most popular Vietnamese restaurants serve pho with meat that is chewy, more tough and less flavorful. I've had pho from Vancouver to NYC to Maryland. This place takes the cake for best pho I've ever had. The owner seems like a really friendly and cool dude too, giving us tips on things to do since we were from our of town."
/user_details?userid=09maL_m5yM-2RwPf9DW0Sg,John H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",4 star rating,I ate here after trying several of the Vietnamese / Chinese places in Montreal's Chinatown and found it to be a truly wonderful and authentic experience.  The spring rolls are thick and the peanut sauce wasn't runny as other places will have.  I orders the Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup ( a must try alternative to pho) and found it to be authentic.   Although it lacked the rau ram ( herbs) the broth was clean and just a bit weak on the spicy side.   The meat was traditional bun bo meat with tendon and flank instead of the usual pho meats.   Once small gripe was that they didn't turn on the air conditioning but so j was sweating like a fat girl on roller skates but it was still a wonderful meal.  They also accept credit cards!

For $11, you can get a huge bowl of pho (size large) with a LOT of meat and noodles. The broth was really flavorful and the meat was tender. I ordered the rare beef and well done beef bowl and it didn't disappoint. Usually the amount of meat and noodles is disproportionate, but this time I found myself with meat to go with my noodles even at the end of the bowl. My only complaint would be that the broth in my brother's rare beef pho was rather oily. We also tried the bahn xeo, which was very good too. The shrimp had lot of flavor while the chicken did not, but in all was very good when paired with the vegetables and seasonings."

They use a lot of MSG in their soups as drinking a few spoonfuls gave me a huge headache. Service could be better. Each time I went I was served by a man who spoke Cantonese and vietnamese (both of which I can understand but not speak) but very little English or French. I had questions and it was a huge struggle to communicate and instead of asking one of the other workers to come (whom I heard speaking English) he simply declared to them in viet that I just didn't know what I wanted. Oh well, at least they didn't start talking crap about me in viet like other typical vietnamese establishments.Secondly, somehow my bill was 30 cents higher than the price on the menu. Not going to argue about 30 cents but still. To finish, the girl at the counter eyed me like a hawk as I was leaving a tip at the counter (maybe she thought i would tip her more this way?). Ok so service is terrible but I never consider that in my reviews of Asian restos. Overall, the place was clean and the food was ok, solid 3 stars."

The server helped us with our order because there were a few vegetarian options that were hard to choose from. After placing our order, they brought us some fried veggie rolls on the house, the freshest I've ever had. We got the curried veggies and tofu over vermacilli and the veggie tofu pancake. If you've never had the latter, it's not what you would expect. You tear of pieces and wrap it up in lettuce. There is a delicious dipping sauce.
