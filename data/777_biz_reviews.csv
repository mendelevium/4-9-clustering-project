Not only a great desert spot but I saw a few people studying here too. The bright lights and comfortable seating gives for a very pleasant ambiance.Ordered some waffles for dessert, forget the name. Mine came with whipped cream on top, strawberries with white chocolate drizzle on the side and these little chocolate balls. I enjoyed the waffle - it was warm and fluffy. My friend's waffle came with vanilla ice cream on top with strawberries, bananas and milk chocolate on the side. I like how they put the fruits and sauces on the side, so you can put however much you like !The service was very courteous. I'd come here again, maybe to drink some hot chocolate and do some work."
/user_details?userid=oiYLcEogLEz7HoQNyy6jpw,Paul A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order. We ordered the chocolate fondue with churros and the chocolate wasn't even hot. The churros were as hard as a rock. The churros tasted like it was deep fried in very old oil. Yeah never coming back ever again and I don't recommend this place.

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside! Love it!The ambiance was great, on a Sunday night, not too crowded, a great place to spend the last moment of a weekend with the love one!Next time I'll go back there to try their salty menu!"

/user_details?userid=_Yz9MFmsYnJxFSa10XSgfA,Robert G.,"Menlo Park, CA",4 star rating,"Got here right when it opened, only a couple other people. I walked in and was promptly greeted and sat down. I was in the mood for brunch food so of course I got a crazy decorated waffle (After Party Waffle) and a side of bacon to make things a bit savory. I also decided to order a black sesame hot chocolate. You can order the mix of this to make at home, by the way.The food came out quickly and everything was really presentable (seeing as how Instagrammable all this food is) and pretty much lived up to aesthetic expectations. In terms of taste, the waffle was now a bit soggy from the mound of whipped cream on top. The extra toppings on the side were nice but I didn't even finish it all because it got too sweet after a while. The bacon was a little smaller and thinner than I would've expected for the price.I think if you're expecting a meal, this could be a place but this restaurant is really good for dessert. The waffles are meant to be for dessert, not necessarily for a meal. The sides might break your wallet and not be as filling. Overall, I'd come back whenever I'm in a city in Canada that has one!"

The menu is full of chocolatey-goodness, and their brunch menu is quite extensive as well.As I had already eaten something before I met up with my friends (OOPS), I ordered a strawberry white chocolate milkshake. It was served cold, and it was VERY creamy in a good way. The strawberry flavour really came out and I was a little sad when it was finished. After my milkshake, I couldn't help myself and I ordered a parfait as well. DELICIOUS. The service was great and I look forward to coming here again!"

We had to wait like 20 minutes until she finally arrived. There was only another table and ours( bad sign, the place was almost empty )We finally got our food which was ok. ( looked much better in the pictures) then when we were ready to pay , they had a problem taking credit cards.  I had to pay cash with the only cash I had on me.  The server got upset because I didn't tip her. Guess what?  i just had to spend all my cash paying the check because I couldn't use my credit card. What a joke!   Never again."

First, let me say that we stated right away that we were just taking out, but the servers still gave us water and a table while we decided. Very nice! We had the cheesecake and a cappuccino. The cheesecake is very interesting (matcha chocolate, fruit, etc) and very tasty. The cap was all right! We'd get the cheesecake again for sure. The rest of the menu looks tasty, too."

/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Since this is a super convenient location for me, I've been here a couple of times. The first few times were pretty great. However, the past few times I've been have been very dissapointing. In fact, the past few times were 1 star experiences, but overall I'll leave it at a 2. The first incident was on Valentine's day. It was busy, and the place was very obviously understaffed. The two or three people who were working were running all over the place and seemed very irritated. My boyfriend and I got the Earl Grey fondue that we've had previously. The pieces of waffles we got were just plain sad. They weren't even cooked! It was dense, half raw dough. We tried to at the attention of a staff member, but they constantly rushed past is without stopping. When we finally got their attention, they were able to rectify the situation by giving us properly cooked pieces of waffle. The second incident happened on my birthday. We headed over there around 8pm for a birthday dessert. The place wasn't busy at all. We were seated and waited roughly 10minutes to place our order and even longer to get water. While waiting for the triple chocolate pizza, we noticed that the table next to us was vacant, but still hadn't been cleared. It ended up taking more than 30min before they cleared that table! When our pizza finally came, it was a extremely dissapointing. It's a tiny portion of dough (that tastes like bread, but has a doughy texture) topped with some chocolate powder and pieces. There was very little chocolate and it wasn't even melted. To me, it looked like someone sprinkled some hot chocolate powder on a piece of naan bread. It came with some bananas, strawberries and a chocolate sauce on the side to dip. After we finished the very dissapointing meal, we were asked to go to the counter to pay. The waiter/busboy/cashier seemed very exasperated when we showed him a discount card, because he couldn't figure out how to input the discount. The food, the attitude and the overall rushed feeling we got from the staff made this a horrible experience. We'll probably stick to bubble tea for a while and give this place a break"

If you love chocolate and sweets but also want to eat something salty because you're a reasonnable person who doesn't just eat sweets for a main meal, this place is great. They have both. From brunch and salads to milkshake and crepes, their menu has many varieties."

I think desserts are much better here.Food: the dessert options are great. I recommend the sets for two that they offer, I think they're a great sampling set. The brunch I thought was less impressive and would recommend instead having the sweets menu rather than the savory if here for brunch.Service/Price: not much to be said here, pretty timely service and reasonable prices.Ambiance: dead in the morning it seems, but I had a good time when it was fairly busy around the afternoon. I enjoy the music and energy here around those hours."

/user_details?userid=-bPHWQp8KDmC5tLc_3_XRw,Lucas C.,"Walden, NY",4 star rating,One of several Cocoa 70 localities in the city including the production facility. The chocolate is processed wonderfully you can even purchase their bars in a variety of percentages of cocoa at each location .The location on Av du Parc has a pleasant and attentive staff who speak French and English. The location was not busy for a Saturday afternoon which was a concern at first. We were brought a bottle of water to start for the table. The menu is simple with a wide variety of savory and desert crepes to chose from. We had the Strawberry and Cheese cake as well as the Crepe with banana and chocolate sauce with whipped cream. The cheesecake filling was delicate and creamy. As well as an Americano coffee. The location takes credit or cash. There is good paid parking on the street.
/user_details?userid=xnsdh6cnfmaP9hxada3jLQ,Elodie T.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"My sister and I wanted to get an afternoon snack and we were lucky to find a Cacao 70 near our hotel. The menu is full of chocolate decadence, but also has a few options for people like myself who are not so much into chocolate.There were plenty of tables available at 3PM and we were seated promptly. My sister ordered a triple chocolate pizza and I ordered the Crepe Suzette. My sister was sooo happy eating up the chocolate pizza and my one bite of it was quite good. Now the Crepe Suzette. The menu said that it was alcoholic but I figured that the alcohol was going to be reduced away during the cooking of it. When it arrived to the table, I was a bit confused. It was a square crepe with a side of vanilla ice cream and a side of the sauce (or so I assumed). I kind of shrugged and poured the sauce over the crepe. I took a bite and my eyes popped wide open. It was straight up Grand Marnier! I probably had the same look on my face as that one time my dad had accidentally taken a shot of Grand Marnier when he thought he was finishing up a taste of Port. Ultimately really liked the crepe Suzette. I cut out strips of the crepe, added some ice cream and Grand Marnier and rolled the crepe over before eating, which gave me a really great bite of everything. 4/5."
/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,Cacao 70 is perfect when you're craving a sweet treat. Their menu is pretty standard and you'll be pleased with most of it. I wouldn't say it's the type of dessert you dream of indulging into but it hits the spot. My warning is go in wanting to spend some quality time with someone because the service is so slow. They usually have 2 people waiting their big restaurant on busy nights and they really struggle to keep up. My favourites are their strawberry shortcake and their banana split!
/user_details?userid=3wt2z4p4k4ZkG0V2SKAd3w,Emily Z.,"Parkwood Gardens, Guelph, Canada",3 star rating,"I would say this place is good, however, it's nothing special. Everything was good, and the customer service was amaZing along with the theme of the restaurant. It was big, and very filling which I could not finish. It says it's a breakfast spot, but more like a desert spot ( crepes, ice cream, coffee ). The waiter was nice enough to let my mother keep her Tim's iced Capp. Overall, cool to try out!"
/user_details?userid=F-OxXtmot1IAG_5odG1mRQ,Daphne L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"The food was good but we felt strongly discriminated against by server/manager Sarah. When we walked into the restaurant, it was mostly empty. When we requested to sit at a larger table, she replied: ""If you want to sit there I will have to split the table"". After we sat down at a small table, we noticed that every single couple here had a larger table. The table she refused to give us was then promptly given to another couple who came less than ten minutes later. It was very strange and unprofessional. We understand that restaurants need to save space, but at least be consistent. We were the only couple among five to have a small table despite requesting for larger one. Indeed, there were several larger tables empty the entire time we were there! Sarah has one of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered in years, it's legendary. She might not be a bad person, but she lacks the most basic understanding of her job function and the service industry. The services at this restaurant has almost always be very pleasant but it's too bad that she ruined the entire dining experience this time. If the owner of the restaurant sees my comment, you are welcome to contact me for verification and more details. Don't let your great restaurant be ruined by a few incompetent staff members."

I've been here many times (for brunch or dessert) since it is really close to McGill campus and reasonably priced. I love the vegetable frittata! Desserts are delicious as well -- very sweet but rich. The choco-nut waffle is a favourite among my friends. I find the service to be average.
/user_details?userid=BCjsgRFDCxGQHr0hVlwqvg,Neha M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,We've already been to Cacao 70 in Toronto so in Montreal it was a must visit for us. I chose this place for our anniversary celebration and I asked one of the staff to make it special by writing anniversary wish on our waffle plate but she said that she'll ask the chef if they can do it...few minutes later she came back and said that they can't but they can arrange a candle. So yes the day was special and of course we love chocolate so it was a bonus and I again fell in love with Cacao 70. Fondue is a must have and yes Hot chocolate on a cold day!!

We got there about an hour before closing and were seated promptly. Our server was well-mannered & took our order within minutes. The After-Party Waffle & Raspberry Brownie Parfait were chocolate heaven. The waffle was topped with whipped cream, strawberries, milk chocolate, white chocolate, homemade berry sauce, and dark chocolate crunchies. The waffle was airy and fluffy, and not too sweet: a perfect base! The strawberries were fresh and the variety of chocolates were to die for. The dark chocolate crunchies were a great texture component. As for the parfait, I can't decide which was more delicious. The parfait was ice cream, raspberries, brownies and milk chocolate layered to perfection. It was topped with whipped cream and Cacao 70's homemade berry sauce. The tartness of the raspberries really brought the flavors together. My only complaint is that I can't bring this place back home to Jersey with me."

Though the restaurant offers actual food (sandwiches,wraps,etc.) as well, I've only ever tried their desserts. Most of the sweet dishes are within 12-17 dollars, are very filling and make a great meal. My personal recommendation would be to avoid the fondue here as the containers of melted chocolate are very misleading and are less than a couple centimeters deep. My favorite dish that I've tried is the Chico-Nut Waffle which is a large waffle served with ice-cream, candies hazelnuts, melted chocolate, strawberries and bananas :) Overall, a great place to be unhealthy with friends and the location is ideal for mcgill students residing in le plateau, the ghetto, new Rez and la cit."
/user_details?userid=DloVvv2ga6UNI5nLGmNTiw,Sammi S.,"Boston, MA",1 star rating,"I felt so bad for the waitress, this establishment is clearly understaffed. She was clearing tables, taking orders, being a hostess, serving food, and closing out checks. Whomever is the manager NEEDS to hire more than one person. The wait time was ridiculous, we waited 10 minutes for our water then another 20 for the food. I ordered a cappuccino, but it was very lack luster and came out as a latte. Also ordered the hangover omelette (which came out COLD) and the side of potatoes came with about 8 potato slices... the toast, if you could call it that, came out also cold and basically still a piece of bread and barely toasted. very disappointed. The butter in the little container that they gave me was already OPENED and used. That is SO unsanitary and not okay at all. This used to be a place I loved to go, but don't think I'll be returning."

/user_details?userid=qntY0ozRmYOzaIaDDyc_6Q,Pramita C.,"London, Canada",1 star rating,"Came to this location with 10 other family members as it takes reservations and the other downtown location doesn't.Well-known for its variety of chocolate, brunch items come served with some fruit and chocolate fondue. While the food was good, the service was terrible. It wasn't particularly busy but our water didn't get refilled unless we asked - and we rarely had the opportunity to ask as they didn't come to check on us often, not even when they delivered the food to our table. One guest even had to get up and get the salt and pepper. Another guest ordered a mint-chocolate milkshake, but was only served a regular milkshake. She took one sip, and told the waiter as soon as she could. The ""wrong"" milkshake sat untouched, while the waiter brought the correct order. They would bring 2-3 plates of food every 5-10 minutes. When there's 11 people, that ends up being a lot of time for the first person served to wait to eat (we wait until everyone has been served before we eat - common practice, no?). Everyone's food had come except one person who ordered the same thing as a couple others (not something really complicated). We quickly asked if hers was still coming and the waiter replied ""yes, its on its way!"". 15 minutes later, the waiter informs us that she never placed the order. 20 minutes after re-placing her order (35 minutes after the last person received their meal), my cousin finally gets her meal. There was no excuse for this, as the place was not busy at all. Not only did she charge us for her mistake (forgetting to put the meal in after telling us that it was on the way), but she called my cousin rude for wanting to get the charge of the WRONG milkshake off the bill. Completely unbelievable. No one should pay for something they didn't order. Just terrible service."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Cacao 70 not only sells dessert...they have a full on brunch menu available until 4pm. Their portions are huge, just like their desserts, so it is well worth visiting!The cafe's menu is a bit on the pricey side for dessert, but I forgive them because their portions are quite big and I would really do anything for chocolate.The Milton & Parc location is very spacious, with lots of tables and booths for everyone. There is a permanent table for 8.Brunch:When you order from their brunch menu, they offer a plate of fruits & chocolate fondue! We didn't realize they did until they brought it to us, but it was a really nice surprise. Because the fondue isn't the main dish, the chocolate is a lot less, but the amount of fresh fruit that they give you is so abundant!Our portions were so big that neither of us finished it on the spot. As for the taste, I think it tasted pretty decent... very healthy. My frittata was a bit bland for my taste, but still nevertheless very good.Cacao 70's strong pursuit is definitely their sweet stuff; their brunch menu is alright. Nothing overly extraordinary, but not too bad either. I especially love that they offer a side of fresh fruit with chocolate fondue.Onto their sweet menu:Nutella Ricotta Cheese Pizza - The pizza tasted great; you really can't go wrong with nutella! The taste of ricotta cheese wasn't very strong, which was a little disappointing, because all I could taste was nutella. But I think using ricotta cheese was a smart idea because the cheese is a good mediator; whipping cream would've been too much and ice cream would've made the pizza way too sweet. The ricotta cheese has texture to it and allows the sweetness of nutella to really be the main focus of the pizza. The fruits and chocolate sauce given is a nice touch, to personalize your slice of pizza just the way you want it."

The pizza also came with a cup of white chocolate, which I decided to pour onto the piece of bread they called pizza, which only made it taste worse. All my friends also tried my pizza and they agreed it was some of the worst pizza they had ever had. I heard that their shakes and sundaes were fine. So if you go here, please avoid the pizza."

/user_details?userid=Ao1fWpdW5DhGBIIcu7nVKg,Matt H.,"Lexington, MA",1 star rating,"We wanted to order takeout as my 85 year old father in law was worn out from a day of walking around Montreal. So our plan was for my wife to order takeout while my son and I walked there.  Turns out the employee hung up on my wife when she tried to explain why she wanted to order.  (I learned this when I got home.)  So we enter the restaurant and I said ""my wife called in an order"" and the guy rolled his eyes and said ""no"" and walked away.  I realize my phone is buzzing and my wife just texted me what happened and texted our order to me.  So unhappily we will start from scratch.Several minutes later the guy comes back and says well do you want to order and I say yes and then say ""but I'm still confused why you can't take an order with a credit card"" and he says ""because people like you won't show up"".  I couldn't figure out if he meant American or Anglo or something else.So I go to read the order from my phone and he simply walks away again.  We go through this two more times (and I got stern...my kids call it daddy tone) and he does the same rude thing...asking if I want to order but walking away when I try. And he kept calling us names under his breath. We definitely heard ""Jesus...f*@king a@@holes"".  The other is far more offensive based upon the religion he perceived us to be but I will leave that out since we are not positive he said it.  (I""ll give him the benefit of the doubt.)I then called the Atwater location to see if we can do takeout from there. The employee there said we could but said I should talk to the manager at the Parc location. The same rude guy at Parc said there is no manager; I ask for the manager's name so the next day I can send an email.  He says he won't give out the name of the manager because it is private.  I said first name is fine if there is a concern.  He said ""I'm not giving it to you.""  The staff does not wear name tags and he wouldn't give his name either.   We left and went to the Atwater location to get our takeout.  (I gave them a five star review.  Great staff.)I think Cacao 70 has an issue on its hands.  Given the diversity of the neighborhood around Parc and Montreal as a whole I think they want to be careful with the offensive prejudices of the staff and the treatment of customers."

Since we were in a time crunch, we decided to eat across the street at Cacao 70.We were seated right away when we arrived at 11:30am (it seems people tend to go out for brunch a lot later in Montreal), and attempted to decide if we wanted sweet or savoury. Lucky for us, Cacao 70 gives you a free appie fruit plate with dark chocolate dip to start. We LOVED this (ordering this separate is $5), but wish it had come at the end of brunch instead of at the beginning. I ordered an Americano, which was surprisingly delicious, considering this place isn't known for their coffee.I originally wanted to order the blue mushroom omelette, but I couldn't change the order to not include swiss cheese (the omelette mix is pre-made), so I decided to order the veggie frittata instead. The veggie frittata came as a huge portion in an iron pan for $12.50 and included eggs, spinach, tomato, basil and feta cheese, baked in an oven. It also came with a side of whole wheat sourdough bread. I was barely able to finish half of this, and took the rest home as a second meal.My friend ordered the open faced chicken sandwich ($11.50) and also only had good things to say about it. My bill with tax and tip came to about $18, which was very reasonable for coffee, 2 meals and the adorable fruit plate at the beginning. I definitely want to come back, but for the sweet menu next time!"

The two employees were there, doing nothing. There were no other clients. I was told they couldn't serve me for ""kitchen reasons"". I sais I could eat in under 10 minutes (what I wanted was pre-cooked and ready to serve!) and they insisted that they didn't have time before their closing time and was told more insistently to leave. Very poor work ethoc, was very disappointed l."

The chocolate marshmallow pizza was good, although, sweet as well, but the marshmallow was grilled very nicely, it's crispy outside and melted inside, combined with the crust, the only downside was the fruit that comes with it, strawberry and bananas, are a little dry. I ordered a hot chocolate as well but I guess the server forgot about it, which in this case is forgivable cause the quarter of the pizza for two of us is already more than enough sweet for one day, and no way I could finish the hot chocolate after the slice, will come back if I ever walk pass."

The food was good but the service was not. We are both poor university students and we understand that the social norm for tipping is 15%, but when you barely have enough money to feed yourself, tipping isn't something that you'd have the luxury to do. We both tipped 10%. It's not as if we didn't tip. The waitress pointed out that we didn't tip the usual 15-20% and asked us if the service was poor. Of course we understand why she would ask, but her attitude made us very uncomfortable. We said that we weren't dissatisfied by the service, and then she proceeded to ask us why we didn't tip the regular 15-20%. Her manners were rude and hostile. Although the food was good, the service and this waitress's attitude ruined our whole meal. I'm not sure if I would return to this restaurant."

We were only one of two tables there at the time. There were only two workers. We were sat down quickly but it took a while before our orders were taken. At this point I should probably have a disclaimer that I was in Paris a few months ago so I may be biased. The hot chocolate was thick and rich. You can tell they melted good quality chocolate. It was super pricey though. My cup of hot chocolate was $10 (Canadian dollar) plus extra for marshmallow. My husband's crepe was just ok. After we were done with desserts, we also had to wait a while before we got our checks as the waitress was playing with her phone."

We are fine with that. She gave us our order and forgot our chocolate shake and we came back to our hotel realizing they forgot the fruits to our dessert pizza. I paid pretty much paid $13 for two slice of pizza dough with chocolate sauce on the side.
/user_details?userid=vAB2A3Fq7lUg4XcK0E3Akw,Chi K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I always come here to eat, but tonight was particularly stressful. We came here at 22:15 because we are both working late night shifts and are used to a late schedule. We usually never had problem coming here an hour or less before closing time... Tonight though, the second we got our seat, we were just told to leave before 45 minutes. Working in restauration service as well, never have I ever told this or was allowed to say this to a customer. It instantly makes you feel unwelcomed and it causes anxiety and pressure my whole meal. I came here to enjoy a good dessert and I'm used to a good service and that's why I choose this place. But tonight i felt pressured to finish my meal and leave, couldn't even enjoy my late night dessert. Anyway, the food was good as always but service was very unfriendly!"

Had a Black & White chocolate fondue with an americano, shared a single with a friend after a meal, and we were full. Best chocolate ever--my mouth is watering just thinking about it.The only reason why I wouldn't give full five stars is because of the service. My friend and I wanted to sit and take plenty of time enjoy our coffee + fondue, but the server asked us whether we were done with our food when we hadn't even finished half of it! Even after that, she walked around our table which made us pretty uncomfortable...so we had to finish our food in a rush and leave."
/user_details?userid=DRr0CKXKai4yKnyvV7OgCQ,Benji M.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,"Got the single dark chocolate fondue (with fruit, brownie, waffle). It didn't seem worth $9.50... Until I realized there was a full CUP of rich chocolate. By the end I couldn't finish it and reluctantly had to share. A bit of a girly vibe, but the servers were helpful and friendly to our group ofbdudes. Would definitely come again!"

/user_details?userid=Dn8PSKgNszrWjyfu6l9NOw,Matt S.,"Ithaca, NY",3 star rating,"Great hot chocolate and dessert. The hot chocolate ($10) comes as chocolate melted into a cognac glass with a side of standard hot chocolate to mix in creating a delicious, thick, and rich drink. My gripe with Cacao 70 is the decor and atmosphere. Coming here feels like going to a cheap cafe, there's no warmth or character. This is not something I normally put any weight on, but a fancy hot chocolate joint should put some effort into being cozy."
/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Cacao 70 is a standard version of chocolatier / dessert places these days. With many other options for patisserie, ice cream and crepes, Cacao 70 wouldn't be my first pick unless you were craving chocolate fondue. I ordered the volcano which was a brownie with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, caramel / strawberry and chocolate sauce. The brownie was alright but I have a particular aversion to 'generic-tasting' vanilla ice cream so I was disappointed to see that a joint specializing in dessert wouldn't invest more into a high quality vanilla ice cream. Other than that the sauce were pretty average, nothing to rave about. On top of the taste, the value for money isn't great considering a single brownie dessert is $8-14. Still, Cacao 70 deserves three stars for its convenient location, attentive staff, clean environment and average desserts."
/user_details?userid=fENhF1F6I9c2ssnkfprYzw,Noor B.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"It has become a Montreal tradition to eat here and shoot my blood sugar levels to alarming levels, a tradition that I definitely enjoy. My family (mom and sister) came here at 10:30 on a Saturday night. The place was fairly empty, with the exception of a couple of tables. The hostesses were sweet and spoke English to us the second I announced ""Je ne parle pas Francais"", which is the  end of my extensive French vocabulary. We ordered the white and dark chocolate fondue sharing plate with fruits, brownie, and waffle bits. The waffle bids provided were barely anything, but the fruits (apples, bananas, and pineapples) were chopped up and served nicely, and were more than enough. We also ordered the chocolate and marshmallow pizza to go, which was absolutely delicious, if you could get past the initial sugar shock. All in all it was a delightful experience as always, the only reason I'm taking a star off is because the waffle bits provided were very few, which really is unacceptable for the price range."
/user_details?userid=4NRlZBth9QepYiBdF6lBHA,Laurie S.,"Pembroke, Canada",4 star rating,Chocolate heaven!! Went here for dessert last night and it was great! Lots of selection to satisfy every type of chocolate lover. Service was very good and place was packed with people at 10pm. The only down side was its pretty pricey once you add tax and tip but it's not like you'd go every day.  You'd likely only go for special occasions except for my friend Tina who'd likely frequent this place daily. Lol

It was around 9:30pm on a Saturday, and there was no line up! Hurray! The decor has a bit of a modern twist to it in comparison to its st, catherine location near metro atwater. The bakers or cooks are in the middle - a very visible location for anyones entertainment. Trust me, it's fun to watch how they make all the dessert art. It's also MUCH more spacier - which is good!I ordered the white and milk chocolate fondue, while my friends ordered the strawberry crepe, caramel milkshake, and hot chocolate. I would say the quality is comparable to their other locations. My friend wanted to try their chocolate alcohol, but we learned from our waitress that they were still waiting for their liquor license. I'm not sure how long it takes, but our visit was recent, so if you're there for those items you might want to try a different location. Servers were nice, our waitress was courteous and always came around to ask us how our food was. She was also very prompt with our requests."

Overall, it's a decent place, lots of seating and dessert/brunch choices for different taste buds!"

We took the sharing sharing menu for 2 or more; which essentially has most of delicicacies of the menu covered. It contained a quarter of triple chocolate pizza, marshmallows for roasting, grahm crackers for smores, fresh strawberries for fondue, chocolate covered waffles, and carmelized bananas. I found the waffles to be the best of them all. The waffles were hot and perfectly crunchy. The service was fast and the waiter was very nice and cheerful. I love the clean, pristine atmosphere of the place. I would most definitely come back to satisfy my sweettooth! :)"

I ordered something called the volcano which was a brownie with ice cream, strawberries, coconut and caramel. My friend ordered a raspberry smoothie and a banana/strawberry/chocolate crepe. The portions were extremely generous and generally the food was delicious. I found my selection to be overly sweet and it caused a sugar induced headache, but I think that was my fault for indulging in such a rich treat. My boyfriend enjoyed his selection as well. We also ordered tea.My only complaint was that service was really slow at the beginning- we kept getting ignored for a good 20 minutes before they took our order. Also, it was quite loud inside, especially with some crying kids."

I was brought a cup with chocolate syrup and a small container with lukewarm milk. It could have been syrup from the supermarket for all I know. The customer service was friendly and quick, but the ambiance is ruined by too many McGill students who take over the place and scream across the tables, actually, the place seems to be invaded all the time by rude Asian students"

We stood at the door to be seated for about 4-5mins and decided to seat ourselves, there wasn't even any music playing. Just silence and the sound of people eating and cutlery. The waitress brought us menus and told us that the kitchen was closing at 10pm though the place closes at 11pm. She said they were closing early because one of the cooks were sick and she was the only waitress working. Complete trash response for the way she spoke to us and the attitude that was coming off of her. She placed menus even though we said it was fine and that we would leave, and didn't say a word to us, anything like ""Sorry, please come back another time."" Absolutely zero customer service. Trash, don't come here, the wait is better at the Atwater location. Restaurant wasn't even full. Trash yo. I work in the industry and have so for 5 years, I understand her situation, but she was just garbage altogether."

A delicious treat... And very well presented. Prices are reasonable considering the amount of chocolate they give you. A few things to improve: the wafers in our plate were really stale. The brownie is too dense and too sweet to be enjoyableWaitresses were very nice.
