/user_details?userid=JPMmBtmdVStt15en9SjLDg,Ryan F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Jardin du Cari is an unassuming gem on St Laurent & St Viateur serving Guyanese cuisine. I ordered the goat roti with pumpkin, and apparently everyone else on Yelp ordered it too. A perfectly portioned and delicious curry of goat, potato, and pumpkin all wrapped up in fresh stretchy roti and served with sour hot sauce. I could eat this every day no joke!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Discovered this place on one of my neighbourhood walks and was hooked by the lovely smell wafting from the doors.I'm new to Caribbean food so I felt a little bit out of my element when I looked at the menu but our waitress explained everything and was really nice.I got the chicken roti and it was soooo good! Really warm, filling, flavourful, and different. It was such a big portion that I had to take half of it to go. Adam got the goat curry and it came with vegetables, rice, and plantain! (I really liked the rice)We also got a patty to share and it was just ok. Nice consistency but the taste was just ok, nothing distinguishable. They ran out of peanut punch but I'll try it next time!Generous portions, good prices, friendly service."
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite lunch spot in the mile-end. Love the goat rôti with pumpkin and lime Chili sauce. It's filling and brings the perfect balance of neat tenderness and sunny Caribbean flavours. Plus the family working in the kitchen is always sporting their lovely smile, taking me back to my dearest vacation memories."
/user_details?userid=EKkMwPoCNkzClCB-6JBbTg,Erin P.,"Clemson, SC",5 star rating,"Followed Yelp reviews and ordered rolls with pumpkin (we got chickpea/potato and goat). Mm mm, so good. We got there around 9:15 and the shop has hours posted until 10, but we were told carry out only. Made sense after we waited ~40 minutes for our food. But still worth it. Especially with that spicy sauce (I wish I asked for extra, it's not as spicy as everyone has been making it out to be).Good staple!"
/user_details?userid=SjDCZJpiIw8yJI7eUHaiow,Vanessa C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In my view, hands down the best Caribbean I've had in montreal.  Goat roti is the bomb.  Hot sauce is nicely balanced and goes great with the curry!!!! Come try it (for the food less so for ambiance)"
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Had the goat roti with pumpkin. It was very good! Family-owned and owner was nice! Prices are perfect for a inexpensive option around the very pricey area that is the Mile End. Would recommend.
/user_details?userid=nf_jdKsadVi9ue-8Zl4g4g,Anhung P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place has a lot of potential but unfortunately uses a microwave to heat up food. Might've been that way since we ordered take out, but was definitely on the mushy side. Goat Roti tastes great!"
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Oh so delicious roti, well sized for the price. Very much hole in the wall, but hole in the wall you should know, if roti is your thing. Friendly (but not overly so) the staff are nice and relaxed. No one batted an eye when my two month old threw a short lived mini fit, and afterwards they came over and told me what a good baby he is (he's great! He fusses and then he chills out). I am partial to the goat with pumpkin (always add pumpkin!), but I'm sure all the options are fab."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the very few places in Montreal that serves up Peanut Punch, a Trinidadian specialty which is basically like Peanut Butter Milk (as opposed to Chocolate Milk). Yes, it's exactly as yummy as it sounds!As other posters have indicated, chickpea rolls, pumpkin curry, chapatis, potato roti, and the owner is exceptionally nice and friendly. Just go already."
/user_details?userid=RTcjR7dDI_xltpb2vVH-6A,Juan Camilo G.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"The goat and pumpkin rôti is glorious! The peanut punch is delicious, but quite expensive if you order it to go (2.50 for a coffee cup). I definitely recommend it if you want some Caribbean takeout. Haven't tried sitting brown there yet."
/user_details?userid=dsPRK5K35aOYdnbdxc-8SA,David L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is great ! Goat roti is the way to go !! I'd say sometime the dish plate rice is a bit mushy and obviously microwaved but doesn't matter add more pumpkin hot sauce and you are on !He should seriously market his pumpkin hot sauce, it's insanely good spicy and tasty !"
/user_details?userid=bMr8RFcfVo4vLJaV3xevaQ,Yesmean S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came to this place with my mom and sis. I had never had Guyanese food before but Im glad that we did. The food is obviously filled with curried but for a great price you get a really good portion. One thing I know is that, if I'm on boul saint Laurent and craving roti...I will come and order it, was that good!"

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the St Laurent location of the family owned and operated Jardin Du Cari. Same bare bones decor as the rest, with maps and posters pinned to the walls, same delicious roti with pumpkin. The veggie roti with pumpkin is one of my favourite inexpensive comfort foods in town, I pick it up for dinner about once per week, and I get the man the goat. Make sure you get the hot sauce that usually comes with, and make sure you're a bit careful with it. I love spicey and am always tempted to slather this stuff everywhere because it's deliciously mangoy and lemony but it's also badass burn your insides hot. The perfect antidote if you've had too much of the hot sauce is the peanut punch, creamy and not too sweet or peanut buttery. Like an inexplicable number of places in the area, Jardin du Cari is closed on Mondays."
/user_details?userid=t21VgnkAWuUS1Ho7Lh1UtQ,Sam B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'i had the vegetable (potatoe and chickpea) roti with pumpkin. my senses may be dulled from being dead for so long, but this didn't help revive them.  the curry didn't have any distinguishing flavors from my store bought fare and the pumpkin spread (extra) went unnoticed in the mix,. +1 for size, it filled me up, and for price, ~ $8.50 with tax isn't deplorable, but it's still a one and done, not something i'd try again."
/user_details?userid=hfzIucnKdAXemPUL3wfNxg,Jonathan B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great Caribbean comfort food, worth every penny - just don't expect to run a marathon after a meal there."
/user_details?userid=BxMnttiad63-aWEpSTaftQ,Ais C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Jardin du Cari used to be be located on St Viateur where Comptoir 21 takes up space. The rotis are great - the pastry wrap is both moist and flaky and light in just the right way, and the addition of pumpkin to the filling is sublime. I usually wash down with a grapefruit Ting drink. Great for a winter lunch or dinner."
/user_details?userid=ofRH_WLCIT_kg-5hIEInoQ,Curran J.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I was not that familiar with Carribbean cuisine before my visit to this friendly and unpretentious spot near my friends house in Mile End.  The chic pea and potato curry roti was a splendid hang over cure that blew my palate away, and sent me into a deep mid afternoon nap.  I could tell that this would be my spot if i were to live in Montreal.  From price to taste to the kind owner, i'll be sure to stop by here one more time before i leave town."
