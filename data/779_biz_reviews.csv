They provide picture perfect dishes, which arrive exactly as shown on the photos of the website. They both look great, and taste great. I've ordered delivery with Uber Eats, and the order was prepared and dispatched very quickly.On the menu:* Chicken and Waffles (Baked cereal breaded chicken, sweet potato waffle,spicy maple sauce, green onions and a fennel salad + and extra poached egg)* Matcha Pancake (White chocolate sauce, hibiscus syrup, fresh strawberries and blueberries)The Waffles were sweet and crunchy, and so was the Chicken. The maple sauce provided the necessary extra kick to the flavours and the fennel salad has smoothened it all with its freshness.The Matcha Pancakes were thick, fluffy and flavourful. The white chocolate and hibiscus sauces added the perfect final touches to the dish.Instagram: @barley"

It has both indoor and outdoor sitting while it's still warm outside. I've had their lattes before but I recently went for brunch and I wasn't disappointed with their vegan option: beyond sausage, tofu scramble, deliciously dressed side salad and crunchy toast. The pumpkin spice latte was a perfect accompaniment!Need to try their cereal bowl one day!"

They have amazing coffee, and a stellar brunch menu full of fresh, delicious choices. My first introduction to Barley came from walking outside and seeing their ad for a ""Cereal Milk"" latte, which was not only nostalgic of my childhood but delicious as well. As I waited to get my coffee, plates of instagram worthy dishes kept coming out of the kitchen and I knew I had to come back. Fast forward to today's brunch with my boyfriend. After some trouble deciding what dish to try first, he finally settled on the halloumi and I customized a toast similar to their avocado toast minus the cheese and tomatoes. You guys... all of it was SO fresh and filling. Not to mention the stellar service we received from Cathrine (how it was spelled on our bill). Would absolutely come back!"

Everything from the decor to the chairs, to the tables, cups, etc. is gorgeous. The menu is very diverse and has items you wouldn't find anywhere else.We started off with their well-renowned latte + cereal. My friends had the normal latte, I took it with maple syrup. Both were absolutely delightful. We then ordered food: matcha pancakes, the gravlax plate, superfood bowl (true blue) and the sweet potato waffles with smoked salmon. Everything we ordered was truly delicious, perfectly flavoured and the presentation for each plate was to die for. Also, the price is very affordable for the quality of the ingredients they're using. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the service that day. It was very slow. It took us 45 minutes to get our food, and the place wasn't too crowded. I'd like to believe there was something wrong that day and it was the reason for our long wait. Despite the wait, I would definitely recommend this place for brunch!!! A must try in Montreal with a unique concept and a beautiful setting."

There menu is unique with a lot of cereal themed items like a number of lattes with available  cereal toppings, I had chosen the matcha latte and it was delicious but if you planning on getting a sweet dish for your main it might be a lot. For my main I got the matcha pancakes the portion size was big so you'll really be filled up, the pancakes themselves were good in flavour but had an issue with the texture they weren't as fluffy as most other pancakes. Overall the meal was enjoyable and staff was friendly I would come back and try some different item"

Unfortunately my two friends and I were placed at a table near the door which brought in a brisk wind every few minutes. Although I asked the waiter to be moved to the other available tables, she found excuses not to move us, not off to the best start.Fortunately, the fun menu made up for the lackluster service. The whole cereal thing, which at first I found a bit lame, ended up being pretty fun. My friend ordered the cereal latte and it was definitely unique. I've never seen this anywhere else and I think it's a fun novelty to try.I ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffles. It came with a side salad which was way overdressed unfortunately. The chicken and waffles were very yummy. My friends each ordered one of their fancy toasts and both enjoyed. The addition of a tumeric egg completed their meals and brought it up a notch. Overall, the atmosphere is really cool and ""instagrammable"". A bit pricy but appropriate for the area. Looking forward to coming back!"

This cereal bar is definitely one of the first of its kind in Montreal. They have a wide assortment of different cereals to your heart's desire. They also have the regular brunch options such as sandwiches, smoothie bowls and chia seed puddings. I had the Safari smoothie bowl which was tasty and fresh. The prices are very reasonable and you can have a healthy, affordable breakfast/lunch. The coffee was fantastic I would definitely recommend!"

Here's why:1) Food: For brunch, they have a brunch and lunch menu available with a variety of choices from smoothies to salads to sandwiches to chia bowels. My wife ordered the halumi plate and it was well balanced with an egg, olives, creamy labneh, pita, and more. My Le Cherry Wood open faced sandwich was so good with the beat hummus and egg on it.2) Drinks: The coffee list is unique. My wife enjoyed the iced tumeric latte and my charcoal latte was delicious and comes with a side of cereal on it. 3) Atmosphere: It's beautiful and spacious. There are two dining rooms and a few picnic tables outside. 4) Service: We went on a Sunday morning and only waited for 7-10 minutes. The service was friendly and fast."

The lattes come with cereal on the side- so adorable! They have a fruity pebble shot called cereal killer shot and it's delicious! For my entree I got the sweet potato waffles with chicken and the chicken coating was made of Frosted Flakes with the most delicious spicy maple sauce. Staff is so fun and nice and the atmosphere is great! We got a cute corner spot by the window. If I'm ever in Montreal again I'll definitely eat here!!

Once inside you realize the place is much bigger. They have an extra room that can be reserved for special events. The many windows offer lots of natural light inside. My server was very eager to share her recommendations once she learned it was my first time. She warned me the cereal milk latte would be sweet and in combination with the matcha pancakes, it made for a very sweet breakfast. The stack of pancakes was generous and you can really taste the matcha, they don't just put it in for colour, you actually taste the flavour. The drizzle is pretty sweet and complements the fruits also. I truly enjoyed my cereal milk latte and all the cereal on top and in the saucer really made it a fun drink. They have quite a varied menu and I can't wait to go back to try other items. Once again, I had great service from  Kira, her happiness was contagious."

It also have such a nice ambiance and decor!  It's a great place to come with friends and have a small brunch photoshoot, the food presentation is amazing. The regular latte already come with cereals on the side, but you can add more. The latte itself does not contain caffeine but I also couldn't taste much from it and its quite bland. I took their Matcha Pancakes and it tasted amazing! It isn't overly sweet and is quite fluffy. I do wish they give more fruits because after a few bites the pancakes become heavy.As they give a large portion, I would suggest to share it with a friend so you can try a bit of everything. There was a small mix up in our order for our coffee but they were really nice and tried to make up for it.  The service was fast and the staff were very friendly. They only accept reservation for groups of 4+ people, so it is best that you go early. I'll definitely come back to try the other items on their menu!"

Most people are in groups of 2 but they do have some bigger groups. This place is very Instagramable. They do have Take-Out, as delivery people came into the restaurant to pick up all the way at the inside bar. This place is made for millenials, who just finished a run or local yoga workout who wants a nice photo for their Instagram. C L E A N L I N E S SThis place looks very modern and clean! There's some TVs playing classic Saturday morning cartoons (we got to watch The Jetsons). O V E R A L L   Q U A L I T YExpect a long wait. But this place is way more than a cereal bar!We had the French Toast Brioche, which is a Meal Share item and the Baked Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was a little hard and dry at times... But the restaurant Prohobition in NDG (it has since closed down) has ruined us for chicken and waffles (it had the BEST brunch, omg) , so we're quite picky. They had like chicken fingers coated in 'Rice Krispy' like cereal, which made it quite crunchy, making your jaw work for your meal. The French Toast Brioche was good, the berries overpowered the egg. I didn't particularly like that, but if you want something sweet this is for you! The cloudy egg is very different! Give it a shot if you're curious!C O S T$$They have bottomless mimosas!! Why is this not advertised?!? $28 all you can drink mimosas! Coffee is between $2.5-5 depending what you get. Smoothies $8. Meals cost between $12-20 depending what you got. W A I T   T I M E SWe arrived on a Sunday at 12:25pm. We waited 10 minutes before sitting down. Then we waited 15 minutes before someone brought us water and took our orders.

I have seen they have a new brunch menu on the weekends from Friday to Sunday. I been devouring their brunch dishes pictures thru my eyes from all the social media. I studied their brunch menu by heart. When I arrived to have brunch today, I knew what am I getting. First, we started with their beautiful looking lattes; I had the beet latte and my sister had the charcoal latte. It was the smoothest and creamiest lattes ever and to top it, they were delicious. Then the superstar arrived on my table. The matcha pancakes topped with white chocolate sauce, plus strawberries and blueberries. The presentation was so stunning, and I felt like a criminal to put my knife through these pancakes. But my tummy wanted justice, so the crime was committed, and justice was served. It was perfect blend of all the ingredients and the taste was heavenly. On the other hand, my sister inhaled her chicken and sweet potatoes waffles. She loved it very very much. We arrived around 10:30, it was pretty packed. But when we were about to leave, we had hard time to get out because it was so packed, and the line up for seats grown so much within the hour. Nonetheless, the service was quick, efficient and lovely. Initially, I wasn't optimistic about how a cereal bar would sustain, but Barley proved me wrong, and it is here to stay for long time... I can't wait to come back from another brunch, so I can try other dishes from the menu."

The food is ok - I thought the ""extra egg on the side"" was a disappointment.But I think stuff is priced about 20% too high and I find the cereal angle to be ridiculous. I mean, they sprinkled fruit loops on the saucer around the coffee cup I ordered. That's a waste of resources and money - which gets passed on to the consumer, hence the high prices.I may return for a cup of water and the cheapest item on the menu... for reasons unknown ;-)"

Don't tell her)...I found this place through Instagram and thought the cereal in latte concept was cute. Today I got matcha pancakes and a beet latte with cereal. I just about died and went to food heaven with the pancakes. How cute I was to think I would eat them with a fork and knife. I ditched the knife and just started eating the pancakes like a cake. It was sooooo filling and glorious. With regards to the beet latte, it was good but I could have done without the (stale) cereal (which was extra $ for the cereal drizzle). Damn you instagram, damn you. I didn't even end up eating the cereal.Just want to add, this place has lots of healthy options too from fruit parfaits to chia or smoothie bowls. I just decided to go the diabetic route today. I'll be sure to stop by again and try different menu item!Bonus: free wifi (no password) and lots of sitting/study/do whatever the heck you do in a cafe space."

This restaurant is so beautiful! I love the layout and the decor. Theres a big screen tv behind the bar and they were playing an episode of Seinfeld. When you go the bathroom there's a hallway of just mirrors. It's pretty cool.I ordered a matcha latte and my boyfriend ordered an orange juice. At first we found the service to be very slow because it took forever to get our food and other people who came in after us got their order before us. I ordered the gluten free matcha pancakes and my boyfriend ordered the halloumi plate so they weren't very long dishes to make. I think the waitress had forgotten to put in our order and that was why we waited so long. We had somewhere to be at at 12:30 pm so we asked the waitress where are food was since it was already noon. She said we were next to get our food. My boyfriend was about to leave to run an errand and come back when our food finally came 15 min later. The waitress apologized and took the bill for us. It was very much appreciated! So what I thought was initially bad service ended up being excellent service! It was too bad we had to rush and eat quickly but we still enjoyed it. The food itself was delicious! The matcha pancakes were perfection! They were so fluffy and filling. It was not too sweet despite the white chocolate sauce. There were blueberries and strawberries on and around the pancakes as well. It was very pretty to look at and an absolute delight to eat! My boyfriend's halloumi plate was amazing! This was better than the Arabic breakfast my boyfriend makes at home - but don't tell him I said that. There was halloumi cheese, labneh, olives, tomatoes and cucumber. My boyfriend would have preferred Lebanese cucumbers instead of regular English cucumbers but I enjoyed it. Also it was a bit strange to have a cold boiled egg because it wasn't expected. The dish came with a  bread that was soft and tasty as well! I really enjoyed this dish.I will definitely be back. I would love to try their smoothie bowls and also take advantage of the bottomless mimosas for $28!! I highly recommend this restaurant."

I wanted to go to all of the delicious, yet Insta worthy places. While scrolling and searching through Instagram, I came across this place. They have a cool cereal concept going on, and I love how aesthetic the place looks. Service here is super dope and friendly, they seated us right away. My friend and I ordered lattes first, which I got the charcoal latte with soy milk and she got the cereal latte. I wish I had gotten the cereal latte because it looked so good! I was about the get the matcha latte, but I wanted to try something different for a change. The charcoal is very subtle, has a sweet coconut taste to it. The cereal latte was pretty but wasn't sweet. The sweetness came from the cereal, but the espresso was great.What I love is when food taste as amazing as it looks. We ordered three things to share, the matcha pancakes, the almond butter toast, and the avocado toast. The toasts were served on baguettes, and topped with a generous amount of everything. I loved the almond butter toast because the toast was crunchy yet soft, and had both sweet and salty mix to it since the butter and jelly complimented each other. The avocado toast was also really good, even amounts and the arugula was a nice touch. I LOVED the matcha pancakes It came plated beautifully (along with the other dishes) and I loved the different sizes of pancakes, with the sauce and fresh fruits on the side. The matcha pancakes weren't overpoweringly sweet and they were very moist and decadent. Service here is amazing, always checking up and asking if we needed anything. Once you're done with your meal, you pay at the counter and tell them what table you sat at. I can't wait to be back in Montreal and I can't wait to come back to Barley!"

The servers are also super friendly and helpful. Decided on s couple of things and shared...avocado toast, granola bowl, quinoa salad, and frittata. Everything arrived looking so picturesque. This place was super instagrammable. I personally had the avocado toast and it was amazing. Really nicely done. I also tried some quinoa salad which was a very large portion size and quite filling! I also had to get their cereal ice cream in which you choose a cereal and they make it into a McFlurry type of thing...I got fruity pebbles ice cream which was delicious. The prices are also quite reasonable here. In all aReally solid brunch spot!"
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was very torn between 3-4 or 5 stars. Here's my first impression of the place. We went on a Saturday. Very cute decor, friendly, inviting and dog friendly! They said over the phone they highly encourage you to bring your pouch! Extra brownie points for me who was two dogs. (One little one big) We walked in and it was not overly busy but a decent amount of tables, You order at the counter and they give you a cute cactus with a number on it. It's a little faded and hard to see. They got pretty busy about 15 minutes after we ordered. We'd order two Matcha lattes, a smoothie bowl and avocado toast.  It look us thirty minutes to get our lattes and then another 25 minutes to get our food. We had to ask twice what was happening because people who'd sat down after us had gotten drinks and food before us. We were pretty annoyed but the staff was very apologetic, because they were short staffed and they'd dropped our ticket. Meh it's ok it happens. The annoying part was they took a reservation (they don't normally but made an exception for two mom's with 5 kids between them for a birthday) and hadn't marked the table we'd been sitting at for 20 Minutes and then proceeded to make us move twice, (which is fine.. it happens we sat at a table of four because it was the only one available at the time in the area we wanted to sit in and a staffer had said it was ok.) but after making us move they ended up putting the reserved table somewhere completely different. Essentially disturbing us twice for nothing.  Meh. It happens.I found their system for delivering food and drinks a little flawed. As mentioned before the little cactus numbers are hard to see, causing the busboy/food runner difficulty of where to drop the food. We saw the poor guy wondering up and down trying to find the number he was looking for. It's a cute idea but not really feasible in my mind. ALL the staff where very apologetic and sweet, which makes up for all the little mistakes and what not...Growing pains right? I've never had a smoothie bowl or avocado toast before and both were delicious in my opinion and nicely presented. (Check out the pictures) It was a little hectic with our decently behaved doggie, but there was a few kids running around and a lot going on. Tables are very close to each other but no one minded our furbaby. Just something to take into consideration when bringing your fur child in.  Maybe it's quieter during the week. I ended up going with five stars because overall including all the bumps and bruises of our three hour long brunch, we had a good time, with good food and absolutely lovely staff.  Looking forward to returning and trying more things from the menu! :)"

The pancakes were delicious, moist, fluffy and everything I imagined them to be. I also really liked the sweet potato waffles and the salmon gravlax that I got. They were delicious. My only critique is that I find the portions to be a tiny bit too small for the price, but this won't stop me from going back again for brunch."

I got the Le Salmon Sole Toast and it was amazing! It was on a sesame flat bread with a gray-ish purple spread, topped with lightly smoked salmon, capers, onions, and dill. It came with a salad with vinaigrette dressing as well. I also tried the Sweet Potato Waffles with lightly smoked salmon, salad, and poached eggs. I didn't know these combinations would work so well and it was both so flavorful without being overly sweet or salty.Overall, its a great place to hang out with friends, or get that perfect IG picture. Its really artsy with a great ambiance. Its also a dog-friendly place which is a plus because I got to see cute dogs, super worth it!!"

The space is really nicely done; comfortable banquet seating against one wall, high tables and chairs on the other, and a regular table and chairs in the back of the store near the cash. The space is sleek and modern, offering a comfortable space to grab a quick bite or a cup of coffee. The space is actually perfect for those looking for a space to work at, with plugs everywhere and single seating designed as workstations; they even have a huge conference room in the back of the venue. Heads up that there's a huge TV in the back where they had cartoons playing: a cereal bowl and morning cartoons, yes please! The menu includes smoothie bowls, parfaits, cereals, salads, and even ice cream! Full coffee bar too! You can actually see the different cereals and granolas they have to offer on the back wall behind the cash, including granolas and rare cereals you can't get in Canada like Frankenberry. You place your order at the counter, and you're given an aloe plant with a number to indicate your order number. You take a seat and your order is brought to your table; cute! The staff was super helpful and friendly! Looking at the menu before approaching, I was approached by a manager who took the time to explain the concept, and the menu, and helped me decide on my order. We were also approached a few times by the staff while eating with questions on the food and coffee, which I thought was great, as you can tell that they really hope the place succeeds and they care about their costumers feedback. As I've never had a ""smoothie bowl"", I opted for the ""Tassie Devil"" which comes with fresh berries, açai smoothie, and chocolate granola. Delicious! Fresh fruit, tasty smoothie and I really loved that granola mix too. The portion was very generous and I couldn't finish the bowl, so I would say well worth the 11$. I also grabbed a latte with my order; you have a choice of rice, macadamia, or soy milk instead of just cow's milk. The coffee was perfect, good espresso base and the latte art made it more enjoyable! I really liked my visit at this new venue and loved this concept of a ""cereal bar""; it's different, it's fun, the food is good, the space is great, and the service was excellent! Definitely going back!"

Spacious, instagrammable, baby and dog friendly, many seating area, a great place to study (even has an office space), a bathroom upstairs and bathroom stalls downstairs and a healthy selection of food. It's mostly breakfast and brunch food items. There's a variety in the type of food, but the menu is still pretty selective (mind you it is a cafe). I've shared both the chlorophyll and cherry wood toasts, which are both delicious but not filling enough as a full meal. For brunch, I had the baked chicken and waffle which I highly recommend. The French toast brioche was also good. I also had a beet latte with oat milk which I surprisingly enjoyed, and they even have turmeric or charcoal lattes. I give Barley 4.5 stars because I do think the prices are a bit much, so it might be costly if you plan on staying there all day. It's more than just a cereal bar, so definitely take the time to visit this gem!"

Pheeeew!!!!We came here twice, the first time were turned away because their system was broken and so they were not taking any customers. A few weeks later we came back for weekend brunch. The space is nice, simple with pops of colors from the cereal dispensers up against the wall behind the counter. We were warmly greeted by the staff and ordered coffee to start. We shared an order of avocado toast, parfait and frittata. I really liked the parfait, it was a big portion that honestly I am glad to have shared because it was way too much Greek yogurt for one person. The roasted plums added a nice touch. The avocado toasts were good and the frittata was ok, it was a bit too spongy.I think I might come back if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so :)"

I recommend stopping by if you have a free afternoon, looking for a different space, grab a quick & healthy bite, then this is a good spot to try. I'm not sure if it was when I was there or if it's common but I wouldn't recommend working there UNLESS you have headphones because it gets a bit distracting, the music was a bit louder than what I would expect (if you are trying to focus).

Definitely busy during typical brunch hours, but there's usually a lot of servers and hosts to make up for it. Really creative menu, would recommend matcha pancakes but put the white chocolate sauce on the side as it's quite rich!"

The lady assigned a table for us near the door. We accepted even if it was super cold (people were coming in and out frequently )Bc we didn't have another choice. We asked her to switch to another available table but she refused and she was super rude. We asked the other waiters and she didn't let them find another table inside. Honestly, I didn't understand why she was very rude with us, she even said that it's not her business if we are cold and we can wear our winter coats if we want. We ended up canceling our orders and went to another restaurant. I was very upset, I didn't except the service to be that bad at Barley."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,Came here on a Monday at 11am and it was not busy at all. You seat yourself but the staff bring your food to you. I had the cereal latte and really liked it--the cup is ENORMOUS (by far the biggest latte I've ever had). The cereal part topping was (obviously) sweet but the rest of the drink was not sweet (if at all) so I found it the perfect amount of sweetness. I had Le DQM chia bowl and it was so filling that I couldn't finish it--and the bowl was literally smaller than my cereal latte! I wasn't a fan of the mint flavour but my friend really liked it. Service was alright--our food and drinks took a bit long because there was only one person making all the orders. But I'll be back for sure to try the salads and smoothie bowls!
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about barley . The location itself is very pretty and airy and the staff are very friendly. I came here for brunch with a friend on a Friday morning since we kept seeing this place all over Instagram. We both ordered the same thing , a macadamia milk matcha latte (which was smooth , not too sweet and very well prepared) and the sweet potato waffles with smoked salmon , turmeric poached eggs and spinach salad . While this plate was very pretty and made for a nice photo, it was just odd in the way of flavour. The sweet potato waffle was decent in taste but was soggy , the spinach was fresh but it was topped in a very sweet weird dressing , the smoked salmon didn't taste like much except sugar and strong fishy flavour (coming from a seafood and smoked salmon lover), the eggs were fine , poached well but the turmeric wasn't really noticeable. Since the food left a lot to be desired (we didn't eat much of our plates) , we decided to order a green smoothie to go - the green smoothie was actually delicious and really felt energizing ! however our bill for this was almost 50$. So price wise this is pretty high for what you get. I think the items to come here for would more likely be the matcha pancakes , the lattes and smoothies and the smoothie and other various bowls they offer as opposed to the more savoury alternatives. I would definitely come back for their coffees and smoothies but not sure I'll be back for any of the food."

The aesthetic of the restaurant is beautiful as well as the food. I got the chicken and waffles and it was great. Probably one of my favorite things about this place was they were playing The Office.

We had no water nor spoons until we ask for them. Overall that was good but expected quite a better experience.
/user_details?userid=6Jn7PO38Cv5KD1hTeRsrbA,Michelle L.,"Florence, Italy",2 star rating,"I'd love to leave a review of the food but the truth is I never even got to eat; 1 hr wait in line on a Sunday in terrible weather, watching large groups waltz in a get tables they reserved in the week (but no reservations day of). Tables sitting with only coffees, people with laptops taking up bar. Having worked in restaurants and eaten all over the world this is insane for a busy Sunday brunch spot. To keep the walkins waiting forever with out even offering a coffee or anything to keep them there, and host large party reservations and people on laptops on a busy Sunday makes zero sense. The poor girls working are frazzled and the line behind me got shorter and shorter as people got pissed and walked out. So your food might be amazing but your customer experience is pretty terrible."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've wanted to come here for a while and finally stopped by for brunch a couple Sundays ago. We arrived at 10:30 and were quickly seated - I didn't think that the restaurant would be as busy as it was but nonetheless, service was quite quick. Having been wanting to be a little healthier after a reckless summer (food-wise), I decided to go for the white chia bowl which had almond butter, almond milk, ginger granola, dried fruit, and some other yumminess; my friend got a green chia bowl (not sure what the name was..superfood something?) despite wanting the matcha pancakes. We were both pleasantly surprised by the food - appearance, taste, and size were all great although I found the portion way too big to finish. Despite a line starting to form, we were never rushed to finish our meals and were treated courteously the entire time (unlike some other places that try to kick you out as soon as you take the last bite off your plate). All in all, a great little breakfast place to visit where you can either indulge or be healthy. Will definitely be back!"

/user_details?userid=Uw0YEWWV1m4PGw_ojnHpSA,Em R.,"Hampstead, Canada",1 star rating,"It pains me to write this review because of how dissappointed I am with this new up and coming brunch place. This place was highly recommended - mostly due to it's aesthetically pleasing food, but who knows how good it actually is. In my experience, I couldn't tell you - let me tell you why.My friend and I are always looking for cool new brunch spots and Barley's caught our attention mostly because it looked yummy on Instagram. We showed up around 2 pm and ordered 2 lattes, avocado toast, a smoothie bowl and a bowl of cereal - the cereal bowl was just as expensive as an entire box (which is very questionable). However, we still went for it. We waited at our table for our food/drinks and after about 30 minutes, we had yet to recieve anything. My friend went to ask if everything was coming soon as we were both hangry. They asked her what number was given to us and she replied ""4"", to which they checked their system and could not find out order. Our dissapointment levels were rising and in our rage, he offered to reimburse us, leading us to believe our meals would be on the house. A few minutes later we received our lattes, and then continued to wait for the food. Another 30 minutes go by and our disaapontment levels went through the roof. My friend called the waiter over and asked where our food was, to which he replied ""we reimbursed you, you're not getting any food"". At this point we were completely shook. How could they reimburse us, bring out or coffees (apologizing for the wait), and then say they were not bringing us our food? He proceeded to call over the manager to which she apologized for the ""miscommunication"", but couldn't offer us any food but they had SOLD OUT of all their items? Excuse me??? Who sells out of food before the closing hour? Isn't there a calculation you can make to determine the food/hour. But to ""compromise"", she can give us a coupon for a free coffee next time. Laughing out loud, my friend replied ""sorry I can get an average coffee anywhere else"". This didn't seem like much of a compromise to us, so we left.Service was poor, waiter's were rude, food was overpriced. What more can I say, if you're looking for a shitty time, go to Barley's."
/user_details?userid=DFdxvlV_sV1nRnSYnxMd5g,Alexa L.,"Kingston, Canada",5 star rating,This was my first time here and it did not let me down! The food was not only presented beautifully but it tasted just as good as it looked! It was bright and colorful and tasted incredibly fresh! I got the beet latte to be made with coconut milk and it was nice and sweet! I really enjoyed it! I also ordered the beetroot hummus toast and thought it was delicious. The sumac spice and olive oil drizzle really made it! I've never seen that combination before so I thought it was really unique and different from what most brunch places have to offer. I also tried a bite of my friends matcha pancakes and thought they were incredible! I would highly recommend either dish! The atmosphere here was definitely younger and many people were working on their laptop as they were eating. We also had to wait 20 minutes to get a table so make sure you leave time to wait - they don't take reservations! They also have a separate brunch menu on the weekends than the rest of the week so if you want to order the pancakes make sure you go on a Saturday or Sunday!

/user_details?userid=n6hDljqqCt4LpN9bg_V3ag,L H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Went to Barley not too long ago. I was early for a meeting and decided to stop by to get a smoothie bowl, I had heard great things and decided to give it a try. I ordered my drink at 9:20 am. I was waiting near the cash for them to complete my order. At around 9:55/10:00am, someone finally gave me my order. Between the time I paid for my order and received it, I noticed that they waited for other customers to order the same thing, before they even started to make it or prepare it. It took less than 5 minutes to prepare that one batch of the same order. I waited 30 mins for them to finish something that could've easily taken them 5 mins to complete. It seems to me that everyone behind the counter should be trained to make everything on the menu. I love the concept and most people I know have had a great experience with Barley. Although, I do think they need to execute better time management & whoever is managing should take the time to train staff to be more efficient."
