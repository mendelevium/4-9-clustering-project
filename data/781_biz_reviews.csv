Of interest, you must try the amazing fish tacos, sous-vide grilled beef tacos, and pulled pork tacos... and don't forget the the on of the city's best hand-made margaritas with spicy chili-lime salt garnish!Come say Hi to Arturo, the master of Margaritas!"

Also tried the flank steam tacos, the seasonal veggies tacos and the jalapeño pepper super taco plate. The only disappointing element was the Michelada which was somehow extremely sour. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this place. I will be back for the tacos (and will try other drinks) :)"

We went down to check it out last night and it was already bumping but they grabbed us the last table for 4 in this tiny spot. Drinks: Paloma and Margarita were delicious and strong, loved the rim on the Paloma. The water of the day was a hibiscus infusion and my friend who hadn't liked hibiscus in the past was totally won over by it. The daily waters are super flavourful and refreshing and less sugary than a pop or juice - a big glass at $2, awesome idea. Eats: I loved the jalapeno pepper app stuffed with bacon and sausage and deep fried. It was too spicy for some at the table, but super delicious for meeee, like what a jalapeno popper dreams of being when it grows up. I also loved the cactus salad, bright and fresh with salty Mexican cheese and tomatoes, super good. Our mains all were well received - I had the tortas of the day which were  piled with chicken, cheese and sour cream and a red sauce. The service is wonderful, so warm and funny and friendly and excited to share authentic Mexican food and culture. When they found out we were neighbours they brought us shots of tequila, a kindly gesture for sure, and effective in putting the goofy grins over the top. The room is already warm, tasteful, cool fun vibes, and I think it will continue to get better - I think the lighting could be a little less harsh and that would go a long way.All in all, so happy to have these sweet folks in the hood and I can't wait to eat there all the time!"

I got the special of the day: Quesadillas de pastor and it was so good. All the flavours (guacamole, meat, and cheese) paired so well together. It was heaven in my mouth. The waitress was also kind enough to explain everything to me. The menu has a lot of delicacies I was not accustomed to. I always feel like I'm bothering the waitress when I ask too many questions about the menu but she didn't mind at all and made sure I was satisfied with my decision.I would definitely come back. It was great!Thanks to Aron for taking me there!"

Ask for the day specials, you won't regret.Their selection of mezcal is such that it can make some bars in Mexico jealous."
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been walking past Caifan at least once a week since it opened and decided to finally give it a whirl with a friend. The location is neat and intimate. The staff are super friendly and attentive. There were a handful of specials on and the main menu itself is quite small and focused which is a nice thing. We opted for a jicima salad, pork belly appetizer, el pastor taquitos and rosarito tacos. We shared everything which worked out quite well. Both appetizers were really delicious. The tacos and taquitos were also great. The El pastor are a tad spicy if you're sensitive but they were quite yummy and the cocktails are great to contrast the spice. I had a couple cocktails and they were great. I learned they close at 2 am on Fridays and Saturdays which is awesome especially for the neighbourhood. Overall, great food, space and staff. The prices are mid-range but worth every penny in my opinion. Everything was fresh and I'd definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=i4SCzdW4-GHbdmAoh2p5Yg,AJ G.,"Daly City, CA",5 star rating,Came in at around 12:30 am right after arriving from the airport. Wasn't expecting much but we were blown away. Everything we had was excellent and the service very friendly. The recommendations he gave for our food hit the spot and then some! I don't usually like Mexican food but this place changed that. Give them a try and ask for the Lengua if they have it! It was the best I had!
/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to Caifan last night after reading Risa's review, and I had a wonderful time!Owner Leonardo explained that ""Caifan"" is a Spanglish term that originated from the phrase ""me cae bien"" turning into ""me cae fine"", and eventually becoming ""me caifan"", this meaning ""I like him"" (or similar).  It now has a variety of meanings.Here's a tweet showing the progression, """"Caifanes"" proviene del spanglish ""cae fine"" (él me cae bien=me cae fine=me caifán) #MeCaeQue no sabía! #FelizMartes"" (twitter.com/alfredoestre…).Caifan doesn't have a large variety of vegetarian offerings, but luckily I was able to find a few menu items that really hit the spot.  I started my meal in reverse, to a degree, opening with a main - Mexican Mushroom Tacos, with a cup of mild hot sauce.  I love mushrooms, so I enjoyed this dish.  The tacos were tasty, and accurate, for lack of a better descriptor.I also tried the ""eau du jour"", a hibiscus flower and mint drink in a very tall glass (:D), which I found to be very tasty, and a nice blend of flavours.I was still hungry after the tacos, so I looked over the menu with Leonardo, and decided to try the Sope entrée - oh my god, it was delicious!!!!!  I recently had a sope plate at another establishment, which unfortunately was very disappointing, so I was apprehensive about trying this here, but boy am I glad I did!The sope is a thick tortilla covered in black bean purée, queso blanco, sour cream, lettuce, coriander, a fried egg sunny side up, and chltepe pepper sauce.  Wow!  The first thing I noticed was that the dish was beautiful, I tried a few different photo angles to best capture it.  Traditionally eaten by hand, I opted instead to use cutlery (because I'm just a mess otherwise).  I was delighted to find that as well as visually pleasing, the dish was just amazingly delicious!  The black bean purée was rich and creamy and tasty, the sour cream was just the right amount of sour, the chltepe pepper sauce gave a slight spicy tinge that enhanced the taste without masking it, the egg fried to perfection with a delicious runny yoke, and CHEESE!?  It's like they entered my brain and came up with all kinds of things I love, then put together the disparate pieces in a way I had never thought of before!I know I'm gushing a bit here, but you really need to try this!  It was so good I ordered a second one, and was tempted to get a third!I was invited to try the Mexican drink Mezcal, which I had never had before.  Mezcal is Tequila's older brother, also made from agave, but NOT the blue agave which is exclusively for tequila.  According to Wikipedia, ""The word mezcal comes from Nahuatl ""mexcalli"", ""metl"", and ""ixcalli"", which means ""oven-cooked agave"""".  Mezcal is made by oven cooking the heart of the agave plant, called the piña, which gives it a smoky flavour.  Mezcal bottles often have a Mezcal worm inside, and the drink is traditionally sipped (""kissed""), after which one takes a bite of an orange slice dusted ""with a mixture of ground fried larvae, ground chili peppers, and salt called ""sal de gusano"", which literally translates as ""worm salt""."" (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me…)You know dessert is the most important part of my meal, so here it is:  I started with the cheesecake, which was very fine in itself, but the standout aspect was the sauce.  Made of blackberries and Chile de árbol (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch…), it was sweet and not tart like I would expect a blackberry to be, and had hints of nutmeg and cloves - excellent!One is never enough, so I asked if there were any other dessert options.  Leonardo offered up the Mexican flan, which he described as more subtle than regular flan, and with a vanlla taste.  Flan is not usually my favourite thing, but this one really hit the spot.  It reminded me of pudding, but still had a characteristic flan feel, with a smooth vanilla taste and hints of cinnamon and caramel.  Not overstated at all, and just a really well made offering.Bonus points for a great selection of music, I got to hear a lot of Cypress Hill's ""Los grandes éxitos en español"", and for the kitchen staying open until midnight (and sometime past) on weeknights!!!!If you can't tell already, I really enjoyed my evening at Caifan, and I can't wait to go back, it's that good, and you should definitely try it!"
/user_details?userid=pQHI4jeu4gKEV4lK5tsmQg,Spencer J.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"We just moved here from LA and are so happy to have found solid Mexican food nearby! We started with the Cochinita Pibil Taquitos which came as four super good tacos. We also had the Chorizo Alambre and fish tacos, both of which I highly recommend, especially the Alambre (a bacon, mushroom, chorizo, pepper mash of godliness served with fresh tortillas). Some of the dishes we've had have been less good, and the cocktails are just ok. The mezcal and tequila options are solid though."

And the service was super friendly. it was packed on a Sunday night and they didn't expect it so it was a bit slow. To apologize, they offered us a beer! Go check them out, the tacos are totally worth it!"

The service was excellent and our entire table loved the authentic well thought out menu. Food is delicious. Our server also took the time to explain each dish in detail, which we really appreciated. Also, the drinks were fantastic. Will return again and again."

I love that Jalapeño entrance it was the best Jalapeño dish I had in my life! The beef tacos were delicious, I wanna come back and try the other ones, I'm curious now.  I had an awesome Michelada :) the place is very cozy! Can't wait to come back! Thank you."
