FANTASTIC.Because of COVID, we had to take out.We ordered the special grilled half-chicken for each of us. It comes with a huge generous Greek salad, a generous portion of Greek fries or rice, and a nice portion of tsatsiki.The chicken was huge, crispy++ on the outside, fantastic herbal flavour.The fries were coated in a very thin herbal sprinkling, fried to perfection and were unbelievable.The rice was fresh with nice crispy vegetables (instead of those soggy veggies you get in low-class Greek restos).And the tsatsiki was thick and flavourful.The portions were IMMENSE, considering the very reasonable price of $14.95 for the whole combination.The menu also had other tempting items like brochettes, souvlaki in pita, etc.Definitely will try some of those during our next visits.This place is a real hidden gem.RECOMMEND THIS PLACE HIGHLY."

They have benches and umbrellas, and was pretty comfortable.There weren't many people there and service was fast and friendly. I got a pork pita. The food is very reasonably priced, which is great for the area it's in. The meat was perfectly cooked and toppings were substantial!Also, my friends got a pitcher of sangria which was on promotion. Surprisingly strong! And so tasty! I honestly would've eaten all the fruits in it if the empty pitcher wasn't taken away Would recommend for anyone looking to grab a drink and a bite to eat with patio seating!"

It was a Friday night and the wait was pretty long. Apparently they had a wave of many people all at once. The chicken souvlaki pita was decent. My husband (who isn't picky) LOVED it. I found the chicken to be a little chewy and too charred. Some people like that BBQ effect but I found it a bit overkill. The garden salad had way too much oregano on it and the grilled vegetables were undercooked. I would skip both and focus on the pitas. And, remember, this is Greek food.. so if you don't like garlic, you will not like this place!"
