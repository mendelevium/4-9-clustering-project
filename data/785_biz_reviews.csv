/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"La Guadalupe is a family-operated restaurant, the kind that I really enjoy going to! I have been passing by this restaurant for the past three years and every time I always thought that I should check it out when I'll have more time, well now it is done! The restaurant is located not far from Frontenac metro station so very accessible.We were welcomed with smiles and were seated very quickly. I ordered a homemade margarita, their chicken burritos, as well as a children's menu with apple juice.Everything was succulent, very well seasoned and the chicken was juicy. Unlike the reviews I've read, the wait was not too long considering that everything is prepared on spot. But what really made me enjoyed my experience there, even more, is the attention paid to the customer: when my drink arrived my son asked to have the same (*rolling my eyes*), of course, the waitress explained that it was for adults only but then she came back with a lemonade presented in the same way. To thank her my son gave her a drawing and in return, she offered us a share of cheesecake each. She stayed chatting with him about school, etc. and my son was very happy.I had an awesome meal and an awesome customer experience, needless to say, that we will soon be back!"

The place is beautiful and the waitresses are so sweet! It's kind of long to get your food because staff is limited to the Mexican family but it's 100% worth it! Ambiance is amazing. Would recommend to anyone

Friendly staff greeted me warmly upon entering. Just don't arrive too hungry! The service is very slow, over an hour for appetizers, over two for the main meal! Even over an hour for beverages! Although water and fried tortilla chips were served quickly! I ate too many as I was very hungry! Food is fresh, although they used freeze-dried cilantro in Sopa Azteca, I imagine that after a long New Years weekend with public markets closed, no fresh herbs were available. The ceviche was among the best that I have ever tasted! Go with friends and enjoy great atmosphere, good food and time to have a long conversation!"
/user_details?userid=5Ty7-Iq8m4sDFj6gdU-czQ,Larry M.,"Cambridge, MA",3 star rating,Great margaritas and very mediocre food at ambitious prices. Next time we'll have a margarita and a very general food item. $30 per person is too much for bland Mexican food.

The food is another story, first the amount of tortilla chips they give you with the sauce- maybe 10? Not enough for two people haha. Then I order a margarita, didn't take them more than five minutes to bring it - uhhmmm that tells you it's not a proper margarita! They probably have a pitcher ready to serve (didn't see a bartender) and it's probably from a mix. Nastiest margarita I have ever tasted!!! So much foam on top of it- thought it was a cappuccino haha. But seriously, it was so warm I had to ask for ice to add to it. Ohh yes, I don't even think they put tequila in it! I ordered the chicken tacos, all I tasted was the oil the tortilla was fried in. The guac they serve, don't think that's fresh or homemade either. Too bad, I was looking forward to a good meal.P.s I make it a point to review restaurants to help other people and the owner know what I think needs improvement and not to be mean. Well, I don't think they care about opinions anyway!"
/user_details?userid=oYdKZzgj1z3NHnJo1Y0jdw,Kat P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went there last with some friends.We were 6 and we didn't make any reservation before going. It wasn't a problem as the restaurant is quite big and it was empty. Some of my friends got cocktails that seemed good (at least they didn't complain about them) and my boyfriend and I shared red wine. The house wine was okay, not a strong taste. Good for Mexican food I would say. I had the tacos pollo. The chicken was dry and not really good... the rice wasn't great either. However the little salad/salsa next to it was really nice. I tried the chicken burrito and the beef burrito from my friends and they were okay but again nothing great.I was a little disappointed by the food... plus I felt sick for a few hours after...."
/user_details?userid=oqrkET25-S3LZK7OMuOUyg,Stefany P.,"Brossard, Canada",1 star rating,"DONT EAT THERE!I never ate Mexican food that was so awful. Thank god that since I ate only two bites that she didn't charge my plate. There was clearly no one in the restaurant and we couldn't even choose where to sit. There was clearly no ambiance and the decor sucked. Super long service and super expensive.For starters the chips that came with the salsa were stale but the two little sauces were good. We then tried the quesadilla which was basically a burned tortilla with only cheese and mushroom. It wasn't good at all.Then I had the tacos pollo, the chicken was disgusting and I don't know how you can screw up that. The tacos shell was way to hard and it had cheese on it that looked reheated. The salad beside it was good and that's about it. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and it was nasty. I had a strawberry darquiri that was super expensive. All and all I don't recommend this place to anyone."
/user_details?userid=o7ntI2rMD9nhmo2CEeU9PA,liz m.,"Medford, MA",5 star rating,Excellent food. I enjoyed the chef salad and margarita. My kids loved the nachos and the quesadilla. The service was prompt and the portions were very generous. I enjoyed the music and the decorations. It felt very comfortable. I will definitely return if we have time.
/user_details?userid=enwMKfMEFwDe-juQUGHY-A,Amy H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered take out at this place twice, a few years ago. A Family run business.On the street on Rue Ontario Est, you will notice it will big neon green lights.When you go in, there's a lot of latino decorations around. The smell of mexican cooking hits you right away. Very spacious, great for groups. Flags, paintings, statues, bright colors. It was a lot to look at while i was waiting and they also play some latino music.TBH,Waiting time can be pretty long. Since it's family run, i imagine there might not be a lotof cooks in the back, so if you aren't the patient type, I don't suggest you come here.However, when i receive my food; it was pretty solid.I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they give nice portions of rice, salad and the largeenchilada itself, just cheese and sauce oozing around. I believe they cook the meat ona charcoal(?) grill? A little oily but everything was tasty and well balanced. Plus, they gave freecomplimentary tortilla chips with guacamole/green sauce and salsa ;DIt can be a little pricey, for some of the dishes, but if you are around the areaand craving for some mexican food, give it a try and you might be surprised."
/user_details?userid=NoHdV8GqDyJOScsUqj75wQ,Robert S.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I was born and raised in Arizona and I've been searching for a really authentic Mexican food restaurant since I moved here from San Francisco.  I just came across this little place when I moved to my new apartment and thought I would check it out.  The service was a little slow but not bad, and the decor was nice and typical of authentic Mexican food restaurants I'd been to elsewhere.  I ordered the vegetable enchiladas and they came in a really large portion that filled me up and could have been split between two people if they weren't that hungry.  My meal with a Pepsi ended up costing about $27 with tip.The quality of food was OK and I would say it was authentic but the sauce was a little too tomato tasting, almost like tomato soup.  The red salsa was especially tomato soup tasting and not what I look for in a good authentic salsa.  The green salsa (salsa verde) was good but not the best I have ever had.  In my experience the quality of salsa is usually a good indicator of the quality of the restaurant.All in all it had a somewhat authentic feel but a little overpriced for what I got.  Still probably one of the best examples of authentic Mexican I have experienced in Montreal.  If this restaurant were in Arizona or San Francisco though, I wouldn't eat there again because of all the better tasting and cheaper options."
/user_details?userid=G8M4H_3OwVYld36Xrzu_Bg,J.F. H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Is this what Mexican food really tastes like?!?! La Guadalupe was suggested to me by a friend of mine from Mexico city, I kept asking him when he was going to make me real Mexican food and i guess one day he got tired of me asking so he recommended this place, saying it was the best Mexican restaurant in Montreal.Let me start by saying that if you're in a hurry you should go to Taco Bell. This isn't a fast food kind of place, it's a meal with friends kind of place. Everyone who works here seems to be family and if not family they have been working there for long enough to considered family. All this to say the service at Guadalupe's isn't fast but it's still good service.Now the reason why the service is a little slow as well as why the food here is so good. Nothing at this restaurant is pre-made, everything is freshly made with fresh ingredients. I've taken a few people to this place and everyone leaves raving about the food.The decor has a Mexican flavor to it, I guess? I'm not sure what Mexican decor is supposed to look like since every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to looks the same, even in Mexico. You aren't here for the look at the decor anyway, it's about the food. So grab some friend and head down for a great night."
/user_details?userid=YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,Ari S.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"How long it took to find a decent Mexican restaurant in Montreal. Not ""party"" Mexican or  Tex-Mex garbage but a real Mexican establishment. Guadalupe, located in a stretch of no man's land on Ontario (not quite Hochelaga-Maisonneuve but not quite anything else either - must just be generic Centre Sud) is that place. No chimichangas or burritos on the menu but mole and chilaquiles.  The food is good. The portions are large. And the cocktails are fantastic.A caveat: Some restaurants you need to excuse the glacial pace of the service. This is one of them. It's a family run place that's pretty understaffed. Both times I've gone there have only been two people on the tables (and it's a pretty large place that tends to have big groups). Both times we waited an exorbitant amount of time.  If that bothers you, don't go. It might ruin your meal. Probably not a good place for a first date unless you want to risk long, awkward silences when the conversations run dry.  So it's also not a great place to go if you're famished. The obligatory batch of nachos that greet you aren't refilled and won't last long. But at least by the time the food arrives, you've built up enough of an appetite to take down the large portions."
/user_details?userid=NRLpgY95Fk9qAStOpk6iaA,Anouk C.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,Best Mexican food in Montreal! I've been there a couple years ago. Authentic and fresh Mexican meals. The restaurant is own by a family. Expect the service to be long (and very long) but the wait is worth it!
/user_details?userid=JZOjAlIMTk8iOTK5oSoDfQ,Karen A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Best Mexican in Montreal! The restaurant is owned and operated by a family from Mexico, and they import their own spices, crush and blend them fresh. They make their own sauces, and the mole is amazing!Slow service, so relax and have a margarita. :-)They always leave chips and two kinds of salsa on the table, but I like to order guacamole to go with them. It's great for gluten and dairy free diets since they make their own sauces and can tell you what's in everything. Don't forget to mention no cheese on top though -- they forget sometimes. Mole pobleno is gluten and dairy free, so celiac safe. :-)"
/user_details?userid=1MAo-Gmw2DuDQDafGfU6bQ,Chris G.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,the food is authentic.  Loved the restaurant.  If you dont speak french or spanish you could have difficulty
/user_details?userid=BMG-sxFxKHQcGeNcOm4vHw,Henri Paul R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"They got the concept right, even the service is slow, but the food is not quite there yet. The recipes seem close enough but the ingredients are not. The meat they use for the ""tampiqueña"" is not even close to what they serve in Mexico. But their micheladas are very good!"
/user_details?userid=3CEjdOEMCNcNIvGbrgV-5A,Rosi R.,"Astoria, NY",4 star rating,"A wonderful family owned business with great Mexican food. What a great find for a Saturday dinner. The place was nice and traditional, very welcoming. We were greeted at the door and seated quite fast. Lots of families and larger groups. We started off with nachos with Guacamole. The best re-fried beans ever and I have had my share of Mexican food. My friend ordered the Burrito, she said was great, but really spicy. I had the chicken enchilada which was wonderful. The check was a total of 60 dollars including tip - forgot to mentioned that we order drinks a Tecate beer and a Strawberry Daiquiri.  This is definitely not a typical Tex-Mex restaurant, if this is what you are looking, then hit 3 Amigos, for you will be disappointed. The restaurant is located in a shady neighborhood but if you are craving a little of Mexico, then this place is a treasure. Next time I'll try the Chiles Rellenos. :)"
