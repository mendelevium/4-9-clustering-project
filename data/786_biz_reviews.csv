It's understandable that it saldly went downhill when the orignial owners sold to a low-rate visionless loser!    True patrons held on and continued visiting this place and although it needed a bit of renovations (carpets, bathrooms) it really was devine!!   I have many many pleasant memories there and I will always hold a fond place in my heart.    Long live the happy memories of the beautiful Helene de Champlain!!!   Here's hoping it will return better than ever!!"
