/user_details?userid=P0z5TBiqkruYnGfLDUpbUg,VL T.,"Portsmouth, NH",5 star rating,"I have two words that will make it worth the trip from the US to Montreal to dine here:  salade maison. House salad. You have not tasted a green salad until you've eaten here. I came to Montreal two weeks ago, for the first time, and here I am again, willing to drive the distance to eat here. The staff are friendly, bilingual, efficient, and the price is quite affordable. I think I may have had a pizza, but the lemon-vinaigrette salad is what I remember."
/user_details?userid=rn2Xc64E2-FMyauKcOT0-Q,A N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I received food from the restaurant as part of a giveaway! But I have to say it was amazing! It was such a lovely selection to try. The Burata was my favourite it was delicious! Everything was yummy and you can't go wrong with prosecco! I definitely recommend that you try this restaurant. Since then we have tried the pizza and it's good also.
/user_details?userid=69AqMB6P3sI5v2IK_I376A,Mark S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great to see restaurants up and running again! The pizzas are light and not greasy, exactly what you would expect if you were in Italy. Even the selections of toppings reminded me the motherland. I also tried the grilled calamari which was cooked perfectly. Not at all rubbery. The decor and the vibe is very casual. Nice place to drop in for a meal without hurting the bank. Service was on point too. Would recommend."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Attended a party of a friend here and we were 15-16 people. It's very convenient that they let you bring your own cake and there's free parking at the school nearby. Since we were a big group I expected service to be slower but they did get quite a few things wrong which slowed us down a little. (Entrees were wrong, drinks took long)The food was fine, pizzas and entrees. I think it's quite expensive for the quality but for all the other benefits you get, it's fair. The size of the pizzas could be enough for 2 but you can eat one on your own if you have a medium appetite."

Inside is really beautiful and cozy. The service was amazing. The waiter was checking on us a lot, he was really helpful with the menu, and the food came quick. The food was magnificent! My dish; Fresca pizza with prosciutto was super tasty. My sister loved her dish; the Gigi pizza with ricotta and mushrooms. My mom had a shrimp risotto dish, she finished it super fast because she loved it so much. My dad had a Calazone, which is a fried stuffed pizza and he thought it was amazing. For desert I had cannolis which were so good. The prices were reasonable. Overall I really recommend this restaurant to everyone, the service was great, and the food was amazing."

We all had different ones, I had the Diavola which was outstanding! My son had the classic Margherita and it was delicious. The wife had Capodimonte and it was by far the best of the trio! Next time for sure!My son for dessert had the Nutella something it was so good !Service was outstanding! Friendly and very efficient. Parking however is a freaking nightmare........"

Although keste has some great high notes, the overall experience lacked a real sense of harmony, leaving us a little disappointed.First, the good. Well, the highest compliment must go to the pizza crust, which was absolutely delicious. Thin, crisp, cooked to perfection, it truly was the highlight of the night. I typically never eat the crust endings, but actually had them here. The variety of pizza toppings was also great, with options like eggplant, ricotta, spicy arrabiatta, and many more. Another very positive note, was how easy going the staff were about us having a baby. They even made it a point to emphasize that they are a family restaurant, which was very nice. The ambiance was also quite enjoyable. Now, for the not so good. Well, despite the pizza dough being delicious, the pizzas were just okay. It's like the remained of the pizza toppings didn't compliment the dough as it should to elevate it to the next level. Moreover, the prices were quite steep, especially compared to other top Montreal pizzerias. Given the higher price point, we expected more. So it really depends on what you're looking for to know if keste is right for you."

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Tried out this local resto in the mile end area for #pizzafestmtl and loved their pizza!  The resto ambiance is quite cozy and has a homey feel to it with it's white and red checked tablecloths. Great for groups or for evening out with friends or dinner for two!  Now for the food..I must say I was really impressed with their pizza! Light thin crust wood oven pizza toped with delicious fresh ingredients and super tasty tomato sauce. We went on a Monday and it was super busy. They also have a lovely terrace. So if you are in the mile end area be sure to check this place out ..you won't be disappointed! Service was warm and friendly which always makes a dining experience extra special. They offer a wide variety of pizza's including choices of white pizza! Also recommend their red sangria. Don't miss out on their yummy tiramisu or mini cannoli's.  Yum Yum will definitely go  back!
/user_details?userid=u4ssANwjChXcxzmgm9PyLw,Joanne H.,"Glenview, IL",4 star rating,Great pizza and very good wine - San Gervasi. The Nutella ricotta dessert calzone- their speciality- was outstanding! Service was relaxed but the wait staff were very apologetic and friendly.
/user_details?userid=KNRwbAKYzHXjaWGQJc_pTg,Jimmy L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Kesté is hands down Montreal's best pizza. Keep in mind that they're not only great at making pizza, but their menu offers a lot of delicious classics straight from the motherland of Napoli. Kesté is quickly becoming a staple name in the Montreal culinary scene."

Pre-packaged cherry tomatoes and arugula from PA for cryin' out loud!? In this city, during this season? C'mon! Go to the market, guys!In the end, it was what it was."

After the long flight they wanted to grab some food, not something to fency but still good foid. This place was perfect. The service was fast and good and everything we ordered (anchovies an zucchini salad, red pizza, white pizza and pasta) was superb the desert was also amazing the only downside is that the espresso is Lavatzza and not a better coffee but thats my personal taste. Reasnable priced great food, this place hust joined the ""I need to revisit"" list"

/user_details?userid=l-1cva9rA8_ugLrtSdKAqA,Vibhor S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"The pizzas here are beautiful. Perfectly chewy and charred crust, with perfect ratio of the sauce and cheese. Probably the best pizza I've had yet in Montreal, along with Gema."
/user_details?userid=QBe3oadPKot2mtuh8jB1UQ,Gurvinder K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Went for a quick lunch. Their pizza is very authentic!  fresh tomato sauce and the pizza crust itself was delicious! Wish there was a bit more cheese though:(
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went here for a Christmas party and the food was good. Really good!  We were a huge group (we took over half the restaurant) and we're served family style, passing plates of food. We tried so many different items off the menu, and just about everything was lip smacking delicious. I'm part Italian, so I have high standards when it comes to Italian restaurant food, and this passed the test!  Even better is that because the restaurant specializes different region than the one my family is from, I got to try some regional specialties I had never tried before (and lots that I was familiar with). My favorite dish of the evening was the grilled squid on the black rice, sounds so simple but was so tasty!The service was very decent considering what a big group we were.  The wait staff were consistently in a good mood.  My only suggestion to the restaurant for future group meals: more serving utensils!  It was a little awkward at first when most dishes were missing serving utensils, so we either needed to share or use our knives and forks.  After awhile though, once everyone was stuffed full of good food and drink, no one cared anymore.Bonus points to the restaurant for having (at least one, that I saw) high chair and change tables in the bathrooms.  They seemed unphased by the toddler in our group, so I'm making a mental note to come back some time with my infant one sunny weekend afternoon, when we're in the mood to enjoy some thin crust pizza while sitting in front of the huge windows."
/user_details?userid=1Nkuhh-HOUB7XUfgImWxmw,Valentina D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid, laid back dining experience. The place is open and airy with a mix of young, old and families and an open-concept pizza station with a kitchen behind it (no wood fired oven sadly).The service was quick and attentive and the margherita pizza was DELICIOUS - great sauce, just enough cheese and a nice, tasty thin crust (take it from someone who rarely eats the crust)....I ate every bite and wasn't left feeling bloated or overly full. (Cheers to the authentic Neapolitan pizza chef!)Reasonable wine list and a nice $25 table d'hote menu which includes a glass of wine."
/user_details?userid=V0UpW_pOplrfYjRW6JHXHg,Susan S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"On a round, brief stop only trip to Montreal the other day I stumbled upon Kesté whilst looking for another place. Parking dt Montreal is always a crapshoot so when we saw a spot we figured what the heck let's take our chances on finding an eatery close by and voilà - whomp, there it is ... Neither I nor my son whom I was travelling with knew of Kesté but were drawn in by its welcoming boho appearance. Reminiscent of Toronto's Descendants Pizza with its communal style seating and pared down decor we chose a table on the sidewalk patio and said out loud simultaneously ""how French ne c'est pas?"" I love my kid. Anyway enough preamble ... I chose the tagliolini, which my auto correct wants to change to tag lion link as I type and the kid, well he's 24 but my baby he'll always be, ordered the Margherita Napolitan pizza. Getting to it, the pizza rocked both our worlds - everything you've ever been promised about this type of thin crust pizza come true on a plate. I'd like to say the same about my tagiolini and it wasn't awful but simply okay. Had the waiter asked if I wanted the small $14. option instead of automatically bringing the large serving at $18., I may be writing with more generosity. The noodles were al dente but the flavour profile needed something like lemon and some garlic and the presentation was lacklustre, I mean it's a plate of noodles with mushrooms so dress it up! Service was good, wine overpriced but what else is new since 1980. We would def go back."
/user_details?userid=qPu8otmjTD0VH5DWv2GsmQ,James M.,"Lancaster, OH",5 star rating,"We were walking down Fairmont looking for a place to get dinner when we noticed Kesté. I quickly had a glance at the menu on yelp and told my wife ""they have calamari!"" She decided we should try it. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and sat at a table without a wait. We were immediately given water and menus. The specials sounded good, one of which, a risotto, my wife decided to have instead of calamari. I had the tagliolini with mushrooms and mozzarella, my sons shared a pizza with eggplant, ham, mozz, and olives. The chef brought us a taste of their house made porchetta which was delicious. During our meal we were treated to service compared to that of high end fine dining while retaining a comfortable friendly atmosphere. My water glass was never empty! After eating we had the opportunity to speak with the chef for a moment. When he heard my youngest son wanted to be a chef he showed him the kitchen and told him to show up in the morning for work! We all had a good laugh. We all were very happy with our choice in Kesté. The food was very authentic Italian, the staff was awesome and the atmosphere is very comfortable. We'll return if we have the opportunity."
/user_details?userid=GGBHens_cVfHn6sndAGhrg,Sasha B.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I came here with my folks and we ordered from the specials on the board: entrecôte steak, shrimp and rappini pasta, and zucchini salad. The place is very unpretentious but classy at the same time (red and white checkered table cloth but real cloth) and the food is nothing short of incredible. It was so good we decided to come back the next day to try the pizza and of course had to get another of their amazing fresh made pasta. The pizza is so good, real napolitana fresh tomato sauce crispy and airy at the same time! Will definitely be back and upon learning of their Monday pasta deal i will be a regular!"

We were not disappointed. There were 10 of us and we all loved our meals. My intention was to have pizza but when I saw the papardelle with porcini come out of the kitchen, I changed my mind in a hurry. Absolutely delicious. (we split a pizza for dessert). I will continue to go back."
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A number of restaurants have come and gone at this location in the past few years, which worries me because I really hope that Keste would stay.Their service is good and price is as you'd expect for this kind of place in Montreal: $12- $18 a pizza.  For that you get to eat authentic Napolitano pizza crust: you know, the thin but easily chewy, air puffed and delightfully burnt in a few spots. You also will be thankful that the pie isnt overloaded with toppings which lets that wonderful crust really shine.  My favorite is the white pizza with egg, bacon and rapini. It's savoury but not excessively salty.  If you like anchovies, apparently that's good too, according to my anchovy-eating husband. You might want to try this place at your earliest convenience in case they don't end up staying!"
