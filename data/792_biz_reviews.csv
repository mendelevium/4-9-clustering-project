/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My review is limited to the beef and chicken patties. Ordered a dozen with some Fruit Champagne that came up to about $18. Pretty damn affordable.The patties were very good and they go well in the freezer for snack at a later point. If you want spicy, these do the trick. They're pretty big so I was full after 2. I think you can have lunch for under $6."

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Mr. Patty/Pattie is a stone's throw away from my aunt's place but I've never actually stepped foot into their shop till this trip. My cousin absolutely loves this place and always brings back a dozen or two bags back home with her. For those that don't know, they specialize in Jamaican patties, which you can get either hot or cold.The main menu is all about the patties but there is also roti, desserts and drinks. Specials menu is only available Friday and Saturday. Jerk chicken, jerk pork, curry goat and oxtail! Wish I tried one of them out.For hot patties, there's a chart for you to figure out their costs. 1 patty = $1.75, 6 patties = $10.50. Not sure why you don't get a deal ordering more but c'est la vie. If you buy them cold, it's $13.00/dozen. There's also the cocktail (mini party) size option.Three options to choose from: chicken, beef and vegetarian. You can tell the chicken from beef as the former has a little red marking on one of the corners.- Dozen cold patties ($13.00) - six chicken and six beef to share with the fam jam. Pop them into the oven and they're just like new. The beef filling was hands down the better choice. Nice blimp of heat, incredibly flaky and tender. They make them fresh everyday and it's tasty because they use lard. So not the healthiest option but hey, that's why you share.I haven't tried any other Jamaican/Caribbean places in the city but this family run shop is worth the trek out west."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is place I go to for my beef patties. They are as good as the ones I had in Negril and Montego Bay. Get one pattie for 1.75$ or 12 for 13$. Enjoy the taste of Jamaica! Ya mon :-)
/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The patties here are probably the best in Montreal and some of the best I've ever had. I tried all three types  chicken, beef and vegetable and they were all good even bought a dozen to take home. The staff here are really nice and helpful they even let us in one time when they were closing up to buy some patties. I have to come back here to try their other things but overall I highly recommend this place"
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Their patties is so good not salty as the congelated one in groceries. The goat curry is ok too but i prefer cooked vegetables instead! The rice lacks of flavor ;it would be better with sauce!
/user_details?userid=xnQ3ZT7XIh7NdzfWJTLsUQ,Vito C.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,The jerk chicken is top-notch. Probably best jerk chicken in the city. And the goat and chicken rotis were awesome. I had both veggie and meat patties and wasn't too impressed. The meat was weird and the patties have this day-glo orange hue to them. Not very appetizing. I've had better.The people who work there are super friendly and the service is fast. They serve a traditional Aki and salt-fish breakfast on Saturdays that is award-winning!Enjoy!

/user_details?userid=Ux4lkzDur4Yub3W1PhYeIw,Clifnote Y.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Ok where do I start.  Patties of the chains always fresh and perfectly delicious always.  Oh wait a second did I mention the chicken roti mouth watering dish.  Unfortunately the hot plates are served only on the weekends but are also finger lickin good, too bad they don't make them during the week.  Over all definitely worth a try and adopt a must."
/user_details?userid=-GzOj_A2kVcKH6rIjbPWPg,Romesh V.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Best patties in Montreal, hands down. Though sometimes, could stand to have more meat and less oniony sauce in the filling, but honestly, this place never disappoints. Keep it up!"

I also ordered a chicken roti and a Grace pineapple soda.My order was ready very quickly and I hopped into my car to go home.I put my keys into the ignition to go but settled back into my seat to taste a pattie. They were very hot which I like, the pastry was very flaky and the filling oh so deliciously spiced and unlike most places, this pattie was stuffed with filling, no skimpy, thin layer! Mmmm, it was worth the drive! I contemplated eating the other but I was a thoughtful gf and brought it home:)I brushed the crumbs off me and started driving home, my roti tempting me with it's curried aroma teasing my senses.Onto the roti...I got home, opened the bag and took my first bite, oh my god was my first thought! Heavenly! Beautifully spiced, saucy, flavorful, nice chunks of potato and the chicken, beyond tender and delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful and I will not be hesitating to drive back when my next roti craving hits me!I can't wait to try their jerk pork and jerk chicken, I definitely plan on getting some to BBQ!Thanks Kim for your descriptive, well written review and thanks Mr Pattie for making your food so delicious!"
/user_details?userid=2pInNXbdv1GI88GPlj9aOQ,Joe L.,"Montreal-West, Canada",5 star rating,"Best patties in town, hands down and the people running it are super friendly. The patties are made on locaton and the turnover is so high that you are always getting a very fresh product and if there are only a few left in the hear warmer they usually pull a fresh batch out of the oven and serve those instead."
/user_details?userid=9sX_Ftp11ibjzE7NCYMAdA,Hey M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"You can tell a place is pretty authentic by the number of people from the islands who go there. This place has always been a hotspot for patties.  The taste alone will tell you why.  The rotis are pretty good as well.  You can also buy uncooked patties regular or cocktail to go. Needless to say I will be going back regularly,"
/user_details?userid=P8hKMc73rWhEnXNV-qA7DA,Liam B.,"Dundalk, MD",5 star rating,"You're sure not going to find a better patty anywhere near Montreal. Got that nice yellow-orange flaky action, well-seasoned (if maybe underspiced; I'm always looking for a little more heat than I can get up here). Really lovely people running the shop. This place is more like a 4 to me, but I'm spoiled from having grown up in the north Bronx, so 5 it is."
/user_details?userid=kdMxqSv9Yeezlr_rPbQiGw,Kim B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the most overlooked Jamaican restaurants in the city (due in no small part to its location), but it might just be the best and most authentic. Raised by a Jamaican mother and having taken yearly trips to visit family there, I'm always looking to replicate the real experience over here and this is one of the few places that fits the bill. The staff is amazing, super sweet and incredibly helpful and the decor, though sparse, is welcoming. There are only a couple seat, so it's definitely more of a take-out place, but it is well worth the trip.The patties are fresh and flaky, served piping hot, and you can also get them frozen or in cocktail size if you're having a party (and inviting me). The roties boast some really delicious curried filling and you can get chicken, beef or goat. Throw in some gizarda and coconut drops for dessert and you'll be more than satisfied.However, the best of the best is only available on Saturdays: the jerk chicken and jerk pork. Holy moly is this amazing jerk! Spicy, sure, but also incredibly flavourful and prepared in a drier marinade than most places use here, creating a jerk coating that really sticks to the tender, tasty meat. You can buy it by the pound, so I would suggest one of each to last the weekend if you're dining with friends. Really, really spectacular.One last mention is that they also stock all the Grace sodas, Ting and even peanut punch. It's the complete Jamaican experience, minus the weather."
