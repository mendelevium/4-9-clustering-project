Amongst the best in Montreal for sure.Get the extra spicy sauce for additional enjoyment. I'll definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."

The owners (family owned) are still the ones behind the kitchen so you know you're getting the real deal. Beware : this is not your typical fast service restaurant. Be patient. The older man may have a rude/grumpy look to him, but he's actually very nice. The food definitely makes up for it though. I would recommend the chicken and cheese pupusas and the appetizer platter with fried yuccas and pork. They are open late and right in front of the metro!"
