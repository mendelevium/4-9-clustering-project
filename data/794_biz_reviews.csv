/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place opened during this COVID difficult times. I would round it up to 4 stars for their courage and suffering. This place offers a authentic north west Chinese cuisines. Cold liangpi salad (凉皮) and braised pork burger (肉夹馍）are their specialty. It should be tried by a pair otherwise it isn't enough for a meal. Considering two items to be full, someone may think it costs more than other place but I don't think so. The price is fair. The lamb soup with pita pieces soaked is another must try. I like the salad and burger set very much and I came here several times. One time the quality dropped a bit I guess due to the low traffic. One thing to complain may be the service. They are inexperienced,waiting time so long or gave me wrong change. Sometimes they were friendly."
