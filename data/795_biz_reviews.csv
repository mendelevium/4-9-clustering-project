/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cheap brunch. Lots of options. A lot of their meals include free coffee. If you want brunch or made last minute plans to go to brunch, this is a great place to go to. Super cozy place as well! I'll probably go again if my friends and I want to go to a cheaper alternative to our typical brunch restaurants."
/user_details?userid=aGJnMKMTt0oy-kOewd0ysA,Nicky E.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"A large group of us came for brunch to the Bistro, and they happily accommodated us. I got the eggs benedict, and I'd give three stars for the presentation of the fruit alone. I think you get great value for your money - fruit, eggs benedict, and homefries - and the food is satiating, but not necessarily anything to write home about (except, ha ha, I'm writing a Yelp review). Our waitress was a little sassy, and that added to the experience, but it wasn't my favorite of all the places we visited in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went here for brunch because I'm on a specific diet and so is my friend, and this place matched both our requirements. I can't say I'm keen to come back. The food is okay, although my chef friend pointed out that it looked like his apple (cut into a fancy shape) had been out for several hours as it was browning, and my smoked salmon stuffed avocado was quite brown as well. It takes a while to get avocado to brown so that's pretty worrying. Also they put way too many capers on my salad! Like a handful of the damn things! I had a side of fèves au lard, for $2, and I got... a tiny pot full of awful watery lukewarm beans. Not impressed with that! It costs less than $2 for a can of beans from the supermarket that are better than this, and that's a whole can!The service was spotty at best - the waitress at one point asked if we were ready to order, and when we said yes she wandered off to another table right behind us, walked off past us, and didn't come back for five minutes. Sorry, L'Evidence, but this was a pretty crappy brunch for a city that's supposed to be great for brunch."
/user_details?userid=6hN5o4-Fj0ZOch_MXtIMxA,Sarah C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really love this restaurant! The ambience is welcoming, warm and cheerful, the food is delicious and well portioned for decent prices! The service was amazing and super fun! We were a group of people and we all absolutely loved our evening I will definitely be returning."
/user_details?userid=i1QjdNtqBUX8s9uTsiAHmA,Andres R.,"Centerville, MA",5 star rating,"What a wonderful breakfast place! The best café latte, served in soup bowls! And all the ingredients are super fresh, the bacon was a delight, and the egg dishes were generous and superb in taste,served with a medley of fruits, which could include mango, large blueberries, melon, citrus slices, kiwi, you name it! Great waitresses in both occasions, fully bilingual.  This is the second trip to Montreal in which L'evidence has been our special Bistro where we fuel up for a great day in the city!"
/user_details?userid=zDL0fWXO84ex9Ip3Lv1CTQ,Y C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We were a fairly large group but I guess it took some of us longer to decide what to order and then our waitress was quite sarcastic when we wanted to order. And then finally when she was ready she stood behind me without saying a word as some sort of passive aggressive way to tell us ""well it's your turn so hurry up and I can't be bothered"" Which was uncalled for really. But then after I asked what her name was and started the check in process on Yelp the attitude suddenly got better. I know, what a loser of me, but it was amusing. We got our food in, our coffee refilled, so thankful I'm tearing up as I recall.As for the food it ties with the median 75% of brunch places in mtl and it would be a waste of time for me to write about or for you to read, so I'll pass.I'm still giving 1 star tho. Nice try, but I don't think having our basic human rights eventually respected counts for extra credit."
/user_details?userid=XaBpjrF4zYGJLnQz2Mmg-A,Nathan H.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,"Good quality of service and great quality of food. Service is delivered with a smile and the food is cooked with excellent ingredients. The servers provide personal touch and care when they're able to. Service lessens when the restaurant gets more and more crowded, which is the only element preventing a five star ratings. Otherwise, this place was an excellent experience!"
/user_details?userid=b_qzqJ2_UT_CygtWNqnadQ,Ari J.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Wandering the streets of Montreal it is very easy to walk past this unassuming brasserie.... And, it would be a mistake.A garage door opens to spill out onto the sidewalk in better weather. And art for sale dots the walls.We ordered the Merguez Baguette served with salad and fries. The sandwich was smallish but very tasty. The Merguez was well spiced but not spicy. Huge salad and large portion of fries.The asparagus and goat cheese Benedict was perfectly prepared. The goat cheese added a gamey dimension to the creamy slightly lemony hollandaise. My wife commented that the fruit salad that was served with it was the best she ever had.. 11 different fruits were represented and the melon to quality fruit ratio was generous! I would recommend passing by the more famous brasseries in this block and give a try to this underdog!"
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5 stars to be more accurateCame in this morning at 10 with a friend since we were close by. The shop was empty save us and one other customer at the time (by the time we left, 2 more had come). I had the mademoiselle (sautéed vegetables + cheese) eggs benny. A very good deal, huge portions, but OK food. The hollandaise sauce was not the best that I've had-- it's a little runnier and lighter than most and I like mine creamy. Eggs were good. Potatoes were deliciously seasoned. Came with complimentary tea/coffee! The waitress was also very friendly."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good eggs benedict and generous portions of fruits. If you're looking for a place to have brunch with friends, then this could be your option. If you're on a run, you can get your brunch to go. I did just that and enjoyed my eggs at home while watching a movie."

/user_details?userid=NUJsFBSaa6RfHETL-ybBCA,Camille L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I had brunch here with my sister over the summer, but keep forgetting to review this place. I'm only giving it two stars because it's pretty cheap, and because we ended up eating the food (we waited for an hour so we were hungry)...but I'm never coming back again.The service was terribly slow, we waited for our food for almost an hour, and the breakfast plates we had were barely presentable. The fruit was bad: brown/oxidized, and they even served us the apple cores, and it was all half peeled and half full of seeds. As for the plate with lox, it barely had any lox at all (literally one small slice).I would have cared less about the food if the service had at least been decent, but it wasn't; it was extremely slow, the waiters just avoided looking in our direction the whole time, and there was no apology whatsoever after the insane wait time."
/user_details?userid=xJpvRrk04rb4rgWtMXaPUQ,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Great brunch place with tons of seating. They have outdoor seating as well as a smaller back room. The waitresses are super nice, and their menu is extensive. Basically eggs however you want. I had the eggs Benedict complete (with ham, Swiss and mushrooms). It was a TON of food, plus homefries on the side and a healthy portion of fruit. A great hangover cure, to be sure. Also had a nice glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Perfect for getting you ready for a day of heavy drinking!"
/user_details?userid=VEMNv8T7qjQD661oWvKqHQ,Steve M.,"Freeport, ME",4 star rating,"I had breakfast here this morning with my family. Everything was very good, and the staff was friendly"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I have some mixed feelings about this place. This is a decent brunch place with lots of options on the menu, and good sized portions at very cheap prices. They have alot of seating inside (and outside seating also in the summer), so you will likely not be stuck waiting long to be seated. The decor inside is very typical no frills breakfast joint decor and the food was just okay. I ordered scrambled eggs with all 3 meats , potatoes and toast. The plate was big enough to be filling but not so big that it was overkill. My food arrived pretty fast once we were able to order. It wasnt bad by any means but it was really nothing to write home about. Service was pretty slow (not many coffee and water refills either) , even though we went on a day that wasnt overly busy, but she was still pleasant and we were able to spend some time finishing our coffee and chatting after our meal without feeling rushed which was nice. While I have nothing too bad to say about this place, I also have nothing to say about it that makes it a standout to me, which is why I am going with the three star rating. However, if you're in the area looking for cheap decent brunch and dont feel like waiting in line (especially if you're a group) this is a good option and is family friendly."
/user_details?userid=LlThZ3HoSWvxMVpTslH3Xg,Ariane S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've only ever been here for brunch but it is the perfect go-to. The eggs Benedict are incredible, especially for only around 13$. Easy to get to, cute decor, terrasse when it's warm, and nicely presented plates. I don't think this place has ever let me down."
/user_details?userid=IvNXN6KvnSaSJjP0FhlBSQ,Juan T.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"What a spectacular breakfast place. The food was amazing, presentation beautiful, and ambiance welcoming and cozy."
/user_details?userid=6E5fP_svEzFEA1znQ3_LTg,Thiago F.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"The place was way too hot (no AC during summertime, really?), the food took way too long, the waiter was messy, dropped those small packages of cream for coffee and never picked them up, and then a customer walked in, stepped on them and splashed cream all over us. We decided waiting 25 min for breakfast under those circumstances was not worth it, so we got up and left. I wish we had at least tried the food."
/user_details?userid=_fq0kJ5xjKQa2Ei3OZ0igg,Jessie Z.,"Atlanta, GA",3 star rating,"Went here for Sunday brunch. A solid brunch place the usual brunch offerings: eggs, crepes, pancakes, french toast, eggs Benedict, etc. The fruits are displayed in a very flattering way; i enjoyed the potatoes. The quality and taste are good, but not exceptional."
/user_details?userid=1murfoP4lzybqGTMApdhag,Frank P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"What an amazing place! Now I have another reason to come back to this beautiful city. Food Quality, flavor and presentation are superb. Fruits are fresh and with a lot of variety. I found service was fast, efficient and very Courteous. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=8u5iWl7JsFiwnBftRM_wtw,Chris F.,"Bow, NH",5 star rating,"After seeing the line at L'Avenue du Plateau we decided to try to find another place to get breakfast. Some wandering around and asking locals lead us here. What a great find. I had the burger benedict which was very filling and good with a PILE of fresh fruit. Others at the table had other versions of the benedict which they all enjoyed. Service was attentive and  they were able to easily accommodate our party of 8. Patio dining was also excellent, not too noisy, crowded and good shade from trees nearby."
/user_details?userid=wMjpM3Q1lSukf4vGReDi-Q,Naz F.,"Hamilton, Canada",4 star rating,Nice little unpretentious dinner. It was packed on a Saturday morning but the staff was great at moving the line along as fast as possible. Our food came out fast and the biscuits were delish! I'd totally go back :)
/user_details?userid=1nvi1SGEKGePQojoc-xUvw,Debbie F.,"Vernon Rockville, CT",5 star rating,"Very delicious breakfasts! All come with fresh and perfectly ripened fruit, many different varieties! Eggs Benedict absolutely scrumptious, omelet with crepe also very good! Nice presentation and good quality for a reasonable price. Wanted to go back again the next day, but since we were in Montreal for such a short time we thought we should try another place. Will definitely go again on a return visit!"
/user_details?userid=VY4d4Ck7yLPWHOIUp0ZkjQ,Monique O.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,My favorite breakfast in Montreal! Cute restaurant. I had strawberry pancakes with Nutella and fresh fruit. You get a squeeze bottle filled with Nutella to put on as much as you want. Breakfast is served till late. I recommend!
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The old Fruits Folie on St Denis. A solid, basic breakfast place. Nothing fancy, nothing surprising. Everything was done well, the service was nice, the location is good. Coffee refills flowing. Great place for your basic breakfast fare. Very good prices."
/user_details?userid=k6ecgDTV9pCyiLzP8tHybg,Tom K.,"Dorval, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little breakfast spot on a cool part of rue St-Denis. Had the traditional eggs over easy with ham and sausages, and was served with perfectly-cooked home fried potatoes, very fresh fruits. Delicious and very filling. Great service, too. All at a surprisingly low price. A real find."
