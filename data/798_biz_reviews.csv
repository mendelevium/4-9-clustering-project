I'm really happy with our experience here. The man who worked there was chill, patient and knew the menu very well. We each got a poke bowl. Mine was shrimp with sesame/wasabi ginger sauces in on all dressed bowl (brown rice, avocado, pineapple, cilantro, edamame, etc). My sister got the tuna all dressed bowl with the island sauce (yum). I definitely preferred the tuna/island bowl, very strong and delicious flavours. We were also offered 2 drinks so we each tried a kombucha (hibiscus black tea / ginger green tea). Kombucha's not for me but I'm glad I tried it. Tucked away near the Jean Talon Market and Little Italy, Ok Poke is worth trying if in the area. Fresh, healthy poke bowls for $9 are the way to go!"

I'm a chef, and I'm what I appreciate about a poke bowl is that the ingredients have to be fresh. They're not complicated to make, so that raises my expectations. I had the salmon all dressed bowl with avocado, and while the ingredients were fresh, the fish quality was low, and the rice was slightly overcooked and too starchy. If all you serve is poké bowls and the only thing you need to cook is rice, it should be perfect... Food aside,  the service was friendly, but the decor was all over the place and felt like I was in someone's messy office... Just really missed the mark for me unfortunately."

It's got big bright windows, simple and lovely design, and a few comfortable tables where you can sit and eat and watch the world go by. There is a tiny but exceptionally well-curated selection of local art, prints, essential oils, candles and other things giving good vibes, and a nice collection of foodie grocery finds as well. But the main appeal is the food. Definitely the best poké I've had. I'm eating vegetarian so I went for the tofu and was so happy to find it flavourful and perfectly cooked, and generally generous piled with big chunks of avocado, lots of soy beans, a homemade sauce I want to put on everything, piles more. I tried it with the homemade green juice which was perfect, not sweet, just great. Go get it."

We We're three ppl and not one liked it. No flavor...  really. Asked no coriander and had some pieces in. My friend asked no onions they sed there's no onions today anyway but we all had some in our plate.. fish was cut like 4cm long.. ?? If at least the flavor was there.. but absolutely not!You might go to jean talon market and buy a piece of bread.

This is a ""build it yourself"" type poke shop which means you need to know what flavour combos you like. Staff was super friendly and loved their items for sale... sage, crystals... all to give a good vibe. I have a feeling this place will become my ""go to"" for the area."
