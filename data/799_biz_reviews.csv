/user_details?userid=yVdLklsi8XAKDWLXJJBZjg,Karen R.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",5 star rating,"We've been clients of La Louisiane for over 25 years.  It is our ""special"" restaurant; the place we go for our anniversary, special occasions.  It is over an hour's drive for us but well worth it.  La Lou and its staff abide by the COVID restrictions without making clients feel like plague carriers.  You are welcomed, warmly, as soon as you arrive.  We always feel like cherished friends when we choose to dine at La Lou.  The atmosphere is laid back but combines professionalism by the staff, without the false obsequiousness you find in a lot of establishments.  Our wait staff was polite, friendly and very helpful.  Truly a professional. My companion chose the La Lou Caesar to start our evening, he was pleased with the seasoning, the beverage is adorned with a spiced bean, and olives, served in a mason jar.  I went with the La Lou cocktail; it was a delicious and tart, a perfect summer's night beverage.  We ordered the Po'Boys and alligator as our appetizers; the Po'Boys were excellent, the dipping sauce was a spicy and balanced combination.  The alligator was good, although, it was slightly greasy.  Definitely not enough to impact the flavour.  The dipping sauce was creamy and nicely spiced, without being overpowering.  Our mains, were the Jambalaya, for my companion and I chose the Shrimp Magnolia.  The report on the Jambalaya was positive, excellent flavours, not spiced into submission, the chicken and shrimp were prepared perfectly, both tender and juicy.  An all around success.  The Shrimp Magnolia was also a success; the shrimp was seasoned and spiced wonderfully, it was tender, flavourful.  The pasta was cooked to perfection.  We, unfortunately, were not able to enjoy a dessert; their Bananas Foster are incredible.  Our appetizers and main just made ordering anything further, impossible.  I enjoyed a coffee, it was rich, creamy and robust.  Not the usual brown goop served in many establishments."

However we ended really dissapointed. For a start the place is real pretty and service is better than usual. So, excellent ambience and nice decor. Our first impression was beyond good. We were enthusiastic. We ordered the BBQ shrimps, the Prime Rib and the Sangria.The sangria was simple and flat. I think the barman was uninspired that eveininig. Afterwards the Shrimp and the Prime Rib were served in our table. Great presentation but the taste was dull. I usually do not make comments about food, but this was an expensive evening. Anyway, the Prime Rib was dull and chewy. It took 5 minutes to turn cold. So it turned to a nice pice of beef to an unbearable experience. Seasoning, temperture, and texture were as bad as the last Hellboy movie. My girlfriend told my that the BBQ shrimp was bitter. At the begining she was expecting an implosion of flavours that turned out similar to eating breakfast just after brushing your teeth. Service is great, the ambience is nice, dish presentation is ok. However, the flavour is dull, stale, and dissapoting."

/user_details?userid=yML2P1evj7FrLncIgaFzHw,Leesa-Catherine S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very comfortable place on Sherbrooke in NDG.   Always busy, always manages to find really great staff.Our last visit was very much like all of the others - consistently good.We started with some fun cocktails (Bourbon peach cobbler and a Sazarac cocktail), had alligator for the appetizer then had our mains (Cajun shrimp and crab cakes).    Everything we got tasted pretty terrific.    The rice was a teensy bit dryer than it should have been but it's really no big deal - the shrimp more than made up for it.If you haven't gone, you should really try it.    Fun experience, great looking restaurant, you'll enjoy your whole evening."
/user_details?userid=HyOy5-WcT6_K6PRyR7RwNg,Eric B.,"La Cité-Limoilou, Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,Never been disappointed at la Louisianne and been there SEVERAL times. Prices were never exaggerated and service always on point...not a big place so you have your waiter's attention.
/user_details?userid=eHpF3kub-Haksw3WMbKmbg,John A.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"First time there the other night. My initial reaction was that the restaurants atmosphere is exactly my type for a nice night of wine and food. I ordered three appetizers and a cocktail to start, of course. Our waitress Tina was so helpful in the deciding of what to try, as we wanted a bit of everything. She even went as far to bring a taste of one of the sauces and explain the textures and flavours. Our table was constantly cleaned and maintained. The cocktails were well made and the food was delicious. The food consisting of beef rib, oysters, and shrimp, accorded with wines that the server had chosen for us. After two/three bottles of wine, a few cocktails, and shooters, we were well on our way to an expensive bill, however to our surprise it wasn't shocking for everything we got to enjoy and a night out. The prices are what is to be expected. Service great, food great, therefore restaurant great. Would definitely go back again."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The crab cakes, although not Baltimore blue crab, were delicious. I didn't get that "" eating sawdust"" feeling that I usually get when noshing on inferior crab cakes from, say, such seafaring states like Vermont or Nevada.I followed those up with a plate of Dinosaur Ribs that too were perfectly cooked and fall off the bone tender but, can I tell you; I'm pretty sure that those were beef ribs despite our server's insistence that it was T-Rex that was on the menu.Try their Sazerac though; it's epic - I kid you not!"
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"If this were an episode of Iron Chef and the secret ingredient was RUBBER, there's no doubt in my mind that La Louisiane would walk away with the grand prize. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery, the shrimp was overcooked and rubbery, the single piece of sausage in the jumbalaya was overcooked and rubbery, the sweet potato fries were overcooked and inexplicably rubbery - honestly, they'd have had the challenge in the bag! I could also talk about the sad side of veg or the gluggy rice, but honestly, they just weren't rubbery enough for my tastes. On the plus side, the service was exceptional and the ambience was top notch. And judging by the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad night. Oh well, c'est la vie!"
/user_details?userid=zDEjNbVK2narQKj-TM7YEg,Simon D.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a great little restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere. I went there with some friends after work for some cocktails and Cajun food. Tuesday nights they have a band, and on this occasion did not disappoint, with some mellow blues and grass roots music. The food was spicy but amazing. Thoroughly recommend their shrimp and raw oysters."
/user_details?userid=-GOyRXrxavzJ5W3axrPXMw,Mayte P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"La Louisiane is one of the better options for restaurants if you live in the NDG area of Montreal. It's Cajun inspired food is really good but be careful when ordering anything spicy. It really is spicy but the chef can tone it down for anyone with a sensitive palette. I went in with some girlfriends and didn't feel like ordering a meal so I went with the shrimp cocktail and shared a plate of 12 oysters for $30. Both were delicious however I prefer traditional shrimp sauce with shrimp cocktails in comparison to their in-house dip. For the oyster dish, unfortunately they were out of horseradish but I love my oysters with Tobasco so I was happy. Paired with a nice bottle of red wine, the three of us were really happy with our meal and happier that we didn't need to go downtown to enjoy great food. NDG needs more places like this."
/user_details?userid=AMu6V9qD8JgPbzk6GNoDkQ,Marianne R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I found the crab cakes to be mushy on the inside..as if they had been put through a blender. The bavette beef was very good..and so were the cocktails.The servers were very attentive.
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,"If I close my eyes pretend there is some Louis Armstong playing while the smoke from the kitchen fills the air and open them slowly you could almost believe you are in the Big Easy!  Tonight I had a great dinner here with my wife!  She had a Chardonnay, I had a Hurricane to get the evening rolling!  Very nice I must say!  We ordered a small green salad to start which was just greens and a nice light vinaigrette dressing! Then for the main course the waitress warned us the Dinosaur Beef ribs were all sold out for the night!  Dang, I was sorta feeling like them!  Que to second choice I ordered the Cajun combo and wifey ordered the Creole Shrimp!  Plus, of course we needed some sweet potato fries to fill up that tummy!  All came out in quick order and was delish, spicy and well presented!  For desert it was all about the Double chocolate chip bourbon pecan pie!  Afterwards we felt like we needed to un-notch the pants but were more than satisfied with the meal!  I've eaten here 9 years ago and once in between and the restaurant still has that same great ambiance and look to it!  If I lived in NDG it would probably be a once a month hit up!  Some notes to mention to the owners if reading:Please try serving some better coffee!  It tastes like brown water!  Also some N'awlins jazz wouldn't have hurt, but you may be sick of that from perhaps trying it sometime in your 20 years of operation!  Still, it would help fit the ambiance of the place and make me believe I was really in the Big Easy (sleazy!)."
/user_details?userid=R-WeeJj8sL2o-6kiT4OblA,Elsa J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is super cozy and really welcoming. We came for a Birthday party about nine of us and the service was very quick. Everything was spicy, I ordered the garlic spaghetti and it was spicy as well. I am not sure if I loved or hated it but everyone else's meals looked really good. I really loved the ambiance and our waiter took care of our every need. I think I would comeback again and try something else."

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cozy restaurant directly on Sherbrooke. offers outdoor seating in the summer time . This is a rare Cajun style restaurant in the area that offers some great dishes and great drinks as well as friendly staff and reasonable pricing. My favourite item on the menu is the dinosaur ribs , huge , tender delicious ribs that will keep you wanting more ! They also have some great chicken and shrimp dishes as well. Another favourite item of mine is the chocolate and pecan pie with ice cream , which we usually end up sharing because we're so stuffed from dinner but yet still can't resist the call of that pie !"

/user_details?userid=OSPuQh94fH2jT1S6bZ6Q8A,Emily B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The outside is very discreet in a quieter section of NDG, but inside the restaurant is bustling with action, lots of tables crammed into an intimately room with the kitchen at the centre. Started with fried clams and hush puppies to start and had the dinosaur ribs as a main. I must say everything was quiteee spicy for my tolerance but very good."
/user_details?userid=BFVa2t6p8EUCwjej5vnFYw,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Disappointing Creole food.  But there may not be a choice in Montreal.  I was suspicious when I heard cuban and latin music in the background.  But I let it go and waited for our order.  The crab cakes came out great, but really, crab cakes aren't a Louisiana specialty so the jury was still out.  Ordered the cajun combo with shrimp creole, chicken etoufee and jambalaya rice.  The etoufee tasted like near-burnt roux on top of a dry, rubbery piece of chicken. The jambalaya was spicy but had no other flavour. The shrimp was cooked just right, but the sauce, which is the soul of the dish, was lacking.  Nothing had that authentic, ""N'awlins"" style taste.  The food is well-cooked, the atmosphere is friendly and lively, but by no stretch of the imagination does it pay fair homage to Louisiana cajun cuisine.  I wish they'd rename the resto.  It's more a Canadian take on American southern food (mac n cheese and ribs are *not* cajun) than anything else."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"One of our only Cajun restaurants but at least it's a good one, and out in a section on NDG that keeps getting cuter. This place has been earning their reputation for over 20 years, not clichéd decor, just a nice, candlelit restaurant with buzz, good gumbo, and some awesome ""dinosaur"" beef ribs."
/user_details?userid=Yhak9njXDvtW7BYUzPzQLg,Eric H.,"Sainte-Foy, Quebec City, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent food. Had the AAA rib steak and it was delicious. Free pour drinks (not metered) and decent wine list.
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For all the variety of foods that Montreal's restaurant scene offers, I find that some of the regional cuisines of the United States are clearly absent or have next to no representation up here.Thanks to La Louisiane at least Cajun food has a presence here, my guess is that it's due to the French connection Quebec and Louisiana both have, but even then it's always nice to see.This place has been around forever and always seems busy. Even then, I've come here quite a few times over the years and have never walked away disappointed with anything I had. Gumbo, Jambalaya, fried alligator, Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels sauce, they've got them all here.Service can be brisk and erratic at times but the folks are always friendly and the outdoor dining in the summertime is always pleasant."
/user_details?userid=lPbszXrXKPnRchbzwVbOIg,Steven V.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"We live literally across the street and have been wanting to come here for a year since moving in. We did last night, and it was great.Before ever visiting, Louisiane has a really lovely vibe, candlelit seats spread along the sidewalk. It always looked very enticing, and it was, both inside and out.The menu is southern/cajun food, which was a first for us, which was nice. We ordered a chicken soup, green salad, crab cakes, to start. And then we had the dinosaur beef ribs and sizzling firecracker shrimp as mains. We also got two bottles of wine.Everything was really yummy, the chicken soup/green salad were good. The crabcakes / dinosaur ribs though, were amazing. The crabcakes starter comes as 5-6 small little balls which you can dip and eat. And the ribs, were honestly, some of the best I ever had in my life. Also, all of the staff were also super nice. I say all, because unlike other restaurants where if you ask another employee for something, they will say ""I'll get your server."" At Louisiane, said person just did the task, happily. Which is how it is in the Europe/Australia, unlike North America etc. We had a really lovely dinner. Every aspect was great.However, the one downside to this place, is that I find it is a tad expensive. Most things on the menu feel a little bit marked up than they should be, I feel. But that said, unlike many other marked up restaurants around the city, La Louisiane offers something that is incredibly unique, and executed very well. For a long time, we only stuck to going to BYOW restaurants if we ever wanted wine, because of the intense markup on bottles especially. However, because Louisiane is unique, and offers a great seating, atmosphere and food, it can be argued that the pricing is justified. I'd return for sure."

/user_details?userid=YvQEbFJx93Bt-Pai7SRn9A,J B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A bit pricy, but worth it in my opinion. Helpful service, nicely prepared food and an attractive dining area."
/user_details?userid=cHqSjxfYLubG54Hj6wZUyA,K.J. G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here sooo many times, and am never let down! Nice little resto, with a small terrace in the summer. The little spiced cornbreads they bring with your bread basket are to die for, as are their sweet potatoe fries (totally worth the $2 surcharge to upgrade from regular fries - to be dipped in spicy mayo).Blackened fish of the day (last time it was rainbow trout) and dinosaur beef ribs are my 2 favourites on the menu. They have regularly chaging specials which are always worth a try as well.The only negative is that service is very variable. If you don't take an appetizer, then you'll have a wait for your main meal. And waiters tend to leave you alone for long stretches, but are never too far to be flagged down if need be. The open kitchen adds a nice atmosphere and delicious smells permeate the room!"
/user_details?userid=7locx2J3EX_BCotbUqmo4w,Hans O.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice sitting outside on the terrace on saturday night, advised to arrive around 9pm to have a table for 3, since they didn't take reservations. The 9$ mint julip was over loaded with ice and the portions were not large, one of my friends from usa said he'd been there a few times over the years they've been operating. Lots of choice in Montreal so next time I'll try another resto on Sherbrooke street instead."
/user_details?userid=NkzavkV8smqLo7SYy5ySWw,Shaina L.,"Saint-Lazare, Canada",3 star rating,"Went on a Tuesday. Service was excellent & we were served with a smile. My boyfriend had the gumbo as an appetizer but it was horrible, and lacking a flavour. But the shrimps in it were excellent. We enjoyed our main courses which were jambalaya and the shrimp pasta. The shrimps were the best part, but as much as we liked those, we wouldn't come back. It was average in our books."
/user_details?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww,Yuko A.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"Yum! We ordered the sweet potato fries and onion rings which both came with cajun mayo and was delicious. The onion rings are very lightly battered and fried. I ordered Fedelinni Santa Fe with shrimp instead of chicken. It was SPICY! sweet with a kick to it.  The owner was kind enough to give me some cream's to put in it to reduce the heat a little. My sister had the shrimp creole which was good. Our friend had the ribs, I didn't try any but it looked like the meat was falling off the bone. For dessert we had bread pudding and the bananas foster. The bread pudding was so decadent, drenched in a whiskey sauce with a buttery soft texture and a crispy sugary top."
/user_details?userid=vlODJYgZktfn17k4mXqMDQ,Mercedes L.,"Paterson, NJ",3 star rating,Had a great time here. If you are not a fan of spicy food this is NOT the place for you.

Her response was, ""You should have told me you wanted drinks.""  ????? Although menu is extensive it is NOT authentic Cajun. And I know Cajun!  Blackened Arctic char was a plain sautéed filet swimming in a dark sauce that tasted canned. PEI oysters were a good choice but had to ask for spice."
/user_details?userid=BMvmFkntFQPAhPqsVwpMvw,Morrie B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,La Lousisiane is a favorite local NDG resto. I recommend you try the baked mussels appetizer and shrimp magnolia for main dish; can't go wrong. Well priced and welcoming.
/user_details?userid=WCHArapR0ZhduJElR9axjA,Farin I.,"Calgary, Canada",3 star rating,"This place has a super romantic feel, Candlelight with cozy tables. Its kept low and has big windows that look to the street, or you can sit out in the pretty terrase. The servers were extremely friendly, fast and polite. Sadly the food failed to impress me. This was my first time trying creole/cajun food and I guess I am not too big of a fan of this type, so cannot say anything about the authenticity either. However the place is right for nice romantic environment."

/user_details?userid=UHOXlHyyb0J3-WccLj2cvg,HC E.,"Studio City, CA",2 star rating,"Mixed.  The food is unpredictable.  Sometimes it's been good,  other times oily.Tonight, not so good.  Mostly to do with the service.  The house wine was absolutely inferior, like two-buck chuck, told the waiter, but he didn't care much. My companion's dish was a $24 linguini mussel dish, where we literally counted 2 mussels.  Told the waiter, he checked with the chef who said he put in 6 ... Uh, we would have seen six mussels.  Being from Los Angeles, I'm used to servers caring about what the customer says or feels.  This server couldn't be bothered, I felt like we were just nuisances - not sure I'd it's because of the coupon or just his style."
/user_details?userid=pv6iucL4vcT4Bm69nd477g,Ruth D.,"Cote-Saint-Luc, Canada",2 star rating,"My companions ordered fish and chicken and were well satisfied with both, as well as the soup.I, unfortunately, ordered a prime rib steak. Because the order was badly timed by the staff, after waiting over 50 minutes for our food, it all arrived. My steak, while a generous cut, supposedly medium rare, had obviously been sitting under a heating lamp, because the thick brown ""sauce"" it was swimming in had a hard skin all over. And the medium rare had deteriorated to medium well. The taste was ok, but my meal was best described as ""chewy"". I explained to the waiter why less than half was consumed but did not get a refund or a free dessert. La Louisiane has been in business long enough to learn to time the preparations of various dishes  so they all are ready at the same time.In addition my advise is to eat there early, as when the place fills up the noise is horrendous. All hard surfaces and the kitchen is very noisy too. I must admit that the chocolate pie was excellent and fresh. Too bad about my main course."

/user_details?userid=BzQwJ-TGOI0294jxjuk1Ng,sooz p.,"Oud West, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",4 star rating,Visited here on a recent trip to Montreal. Ambiance was fun and welcoming. Great indoor seating in front of large open windows looking out on to peaceful Montreal street. Great Servers. Very friendly and informative. We found out the history of the restaurant and heard a bit about the current owners' effort to turn it into the stylish establishment it now is. We ordered from the specials menu which offered tasty dishes like roasted pork loin with asparagus and fennel and pan seared halibut with bacon. Wine list offered affordable quality options. To top it off they were playing 70's disco all night which was awesome. All in all a very enjoyable experience. We will return on our next visit.
