/user_details?userid=4TenUuWdhO7-bVNXRMVBpQ,Martin G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A favorite spot for my colleagues and I (as in almost once-a-week!), Mange-Moi has some of the best poutines in the St-Lau/St-Denis area, and their burgers are quite good too.Spicy food lover? Try the Kamikaze, made with lamb merguez, pickled banana peppers and Frank's Red Hot sauce. Delicious. Do you prefer the sweet and salty? The Cochonne, made with pulled pork and sweet barbecue sauce is to die for.Cocktails are pretty good. I do wish they'd have better craft beer on tap, instead of the ol' tired St-Ambroise.Tip: Arrive early, service can get a bit slow when its starting to fill up."

Their chicken wings are really good and I mean it! Also, even if you are not a fan of heavy carbs, you still going to devour their sweet potato fries. Friendly service and cool atmosphere in general, so yes, definitely worth visiting or ordering from!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really cute spot if you're looking for a burger and poutine joint. I came here for poutine week, for which they featured Chef Bandit- a Haitian themed poutine with morsels of chicken, pickled slaw (a bit heavy on the vinegar), mac salad, and good old fries, cheese and saucy gravy. They offer a mason jar cocktail and poutine for 22$. Fun little spot."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"4 stars because it was good but it wasn't all good. Came here initially for drinks with my cousin and was surprised by their giant mason jar $13 cocktails. I don't drink at all so I really needed something light on the alcohol and fruity to the max. The waiter was super patient and recommended lots of options, I decided to get the poulette. It was so gooood. It was white rhum, peach liquor, lemonade, and mango juice. 10/10 would order again even though it has alcohol.I also got the pogos and the chicken wings to share. The pogos were great! Although I suspect it's because they are just reheated name brand pogos. The chicken wings is where they lost my star. They were just all over the place. Dry, kinda tasted funny, and just not enjoyable to eat.My cousin got the nachos and the bloody ceasar. She liked everything.We only ordered entrees and drinks but the portions are big so we were completely full. The pogo portion isn't very big but if you get a meal on the side it becomes too much."

I wasn't planning to stop there but I was feeling for a poutine and came across it. They've got lots of variety and you will surely enjoy the food. I personally took the ""fou de viande"" with a blonde bière. Goood service and food for 18$"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Thanks to uber eats I discovered thisPlace. The name stood out to me so clearly I clicked menu to investigate, it was your typical greasy spoon but looked like good quality vs a random burger joint on the corner. The food was good for what it cost, the poutine came with lots of curd cheese and the hot dog came with a well toasted home made bun with loads of creamy coleslaw. Hamburger was good but came with no toppings, not sure why but I'm guessing u have to check off what you want on it vs just clicking add to cart. Will keep that in mind for next time.Hotdog was $5 Poutine was $7Burger salad frie $13The fries tasted as if the oil needed to be changed but other then that it was good and I would recommend this place for a lazy weekend meal or hangover meal."

/user_details?userid=6NlZffPhmy5IgJdu_nI9nA,Greta E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,My boyfriend has been raving about this place for months so we finally went to try it out. I have to say that for a burger place i was really disappointed with my burger (portobello) & for a poutine place my bf did not like his side poutine. The sweet potato fries were really good however & they came with arguably the best aioli I've ever had.
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Do you like EDM? I don't like EDM. Mange-moi doesn't care because it's a huge fan - and there I was, eating a poutine to a needless EDM Shakira remix. I had the ""hallucinogen"" poutine - classy - which includes mushrooms. My boyfriend had the Elvis, with onions, peppers, and ground meat. They came unevenly heated, so eat quick! Mine was delicious. I enjoyed the strong pepper sauce and generous helping of mushrooms. The Elvis tasted good, and very much like an all-dressed pizza. The fried pickles, I am sorry to report, were little spears of pickle, which means they are super tough to eat. Fried slices or bust!Mange-moi is very current: lots of wood and blackboards, greasy fare at decent prices. A lot of places around town do the same thing, and I am not sure I am their intended audience. The punny name - in almost bad taste tbh - the semi-careless service, the loud music (with a side of dubstep like it's 2004)... Of course a place like that has tv screens to broadcast sports, but all they showed was golf. A steep price to pay while waiting on a poutine."
/user_details?userid=PqI494Hy7C3hZIVaGpc2vg,Emy P.,"St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada",4 star rating,"Believe it or not, I had one of the most amazing burger at this spot for the Burger week Event in Montreal and it wasn't even on the menu. VIP. Beef pattie, poutine AND pulled pork between two buns. Probably my cheat quota for the month, but how delicious.Well meat and dirtyness aren't the only highlights here. Vegetarian burgers and salads are also available. I've tried the balsamic aragula and it was awesome, (more than) big enough and fresh. To push it a bit further, I've also had a few bites of the Ferrero Rocher. Simply to die for. The staff is very cool and efficient. Plus kitchen is open until 11:30PM. Been there twice and will def go back. Amen."
/user_details?userid=m5fNVWQFfgOj-sAXBxeBSw,Marcus S.,"South Orange, NJ",3 star rating,"Right off the bat I can say that if you're looking for drinks and poutine this is probably a good start. The menu has 10+ different types of poutine bowls you can get spicy, cheesy, meaty, onions, salsa and more. Unfortunately with my short visit it wasn't even the best poutine I had - the"" La Petit Dejeuner"" which had ham, bacon and beef but it was so so bland, even dowsing it in tobasco sauce barely have it any flavor. I went to a food truck festival a couple days prior and got poutine similar to this one and it was way better. So that felt like a rip off. The other problem was the waitress was extremely busy she not only took our orders, but brought out food, water and did the same for like 4 other tables. She was hard to get a hold of if we needed anything and when we did it took long because again she was the only one there. Where was the help? If you're looking to get full fast and have some beers I'd say come here, still you could probably do better."

/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Nothing spectacular and, in my opinion, overpriced for what it is. The lamb burger was high on the messiness and low on taste. The meat was quite tough, almost rubbery. Overall very bland; I ended up calling garlic mayo to the rescue. Good Ceasar salad. I was not particularly impressed by the poutine but the fries were excellent (probably freshly cut). Beer selection, meh - at least the St-Ambroise IPA was on tap. Total paid after tax and tip, $32.It just doesn't appeal to neither my burger or beer tastes."
/user_details?userid=e0NKwyDWSbT8JNjj4iN_EQ,Greg W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went here with friends who were specifically looking for great poutine. I ordered the chorizo poutine: who can resist fries *and* sausage? Turns out it was fine, but nothing special. I'm not sure, but suspect the fries were not quite fresh out of the deep frier.Service was pleasant and friendly. Nice welcoming decor. Not too big, so pretty quiet."
/user_details?userid=AVq1gBNBeUC3YVIYhvzR2w,L D.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,Accidentally came across this cute burger/poutine bar on our first night in Montréal. The burger and cocktail the first night was so good that we returned for poutine and a beer a few days later and it was just as great! Definitely try the Poutine Celine!
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really friendly service and there are things on the menu for vegetarians, I had the portobello mushroom burger and it was quite tasty. The fries are nothing to write home about but the beer selection is decent. The outdoor seating was a bonus and they allowed my dog to join me which was a really nice touch."

Loved itThere are a lot of poutine choices in the city (and some even better ones off the island). We've been here several times and it's always been tasty. Lots of variety and all the ones we've tried were really good. Great little patio for the summer, good place to enjoy their mason jar cocktails!"
/user_details?userid=VKOrul781_vhOytrYgFqeQ,Gloria S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 4.5/5Service: 3.5/5Location: 4/5Mange-moi is a renowned Montreal poutinerie in Mount Royal. I came here for a late night dinner and drinks with friends on Friday night and I instantly fell in love with the vibe of the place, not to mention the food. It has the typical Montreal hipster vibe, varnished wood slabs for the tables, weathered wooden wall paneling, and menus written up on giant chalkboards hung on the walls. The patio was packed with patrons, but thankfully we only had to wait a couple minutes for a table.I ordered a classic chien-chaud (haha hot dog en Francais), only $5, and I was very impressed. It came, not in a traditional hot dog bun, but wedged inside a thick slice of French bread toasted to golden-brown perfection. As one of the cheapest items on the menu, I wasn't expecting something this good. Besides the traditional ketchup/mustard/relish trio of condiments, the hotdog was topped with fresh coleslaw, a crunchy touch that paired surprisingly well. We also ordered a couple pitchers of red wine sangria that was so fruity and divine. Cocktails are sipped from mason jars (a hipster staple) and fries are served in tiny deep fryer wire baskets (I can never resist a mini version of anything). I was able to sneak a couple bites of my friends' dishes (as you do) and the food was consistently tasty. The sweet potato fries and beautifully crisp, the poutine had the squeakiest cheese curds, hot wings with just the right amount of kick. Overall I loved this place and would definitely recommend it for a fun lunch or dinner with friends. Don't expect to eat anything healthy, this is the place to indulge."

Nice, cozy atmosphere. Excellent service. And the food was spot on. My burger is exactly what I wanted. My son loved the pulled pork poutine. My wife and her dad enjoyed their salads. The wings were great...I'm not a fan of buffalo style wings so these were a hit. And how can you go wrong with big drinks? We will definitely be back on our next visit to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,This place could be so much better. The fries are a bit soggy and not crispy and the inside of the fries seemed undercooked. Service is average and and the burgers are ok. There are way better hamburger places in the city and this one is just mediocre. Even the poutine fails to surprise
/user_details?userid=peeffWDR7fVpN4HgZX_OIQ,Mr. Bean B.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",5 star rating,"Jamaica Plain is in the house tonight. *dancing in place*No question, The Plateau boasts beautiful scenery, is the most trendy neighborhood of all Montreal and is my favorite part of the city to pound the pavement and explore. Also as a side note, If you're in to world class street graffiti, you've just found the mother load. Be sure to bring a camera as photo ops in this area are abundant.Mange-Moi opened its doors on Mont Royal in June 2013 and is conveniently located just a few minutes away from the Orange Line Metro. This cozy burger bar seats about 20 people and has a pretty good menu - consisting of among others, burgers, hot dogs and of course, poutine - and bar selection. the fruity looking drinks in the mason jar looks very refreshing, though I chose to go for a shirley temple instead. Don't ask.Fresh off burning a stick of some of that Montreal good, I decided to go for the CRAB CAKE BURGER, which was amazing! Very flavorful. The meat was super fresh, and was accompanied with a very well portioned caesar salad and crispy thick cut frites. The presentation was also pretty cool, as it was plated on a cutting board. Overall one of my favorite dishes of the past year for sure. It even prompted me to dap up the chef after my meal for well deserved props to my culinary ninja.If ever on Mont Royal and fixing for a hearty meal, be sure to stop by Mange-Moi. You are guaranteed to leave with a smile from ear to ear.Go Bruins!!!*Beantowns Finest*"
/user_details?userid=mjub1lsUL9Li0uEPWNONLQ,Chris F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Mange-moi on a Saturday night around 8pm. The server was friendly and prompt. I ordered a poutine and a mason jar of sangria. Mason jar cocktails are all the rage these days and Mange-moi has a whole spread of 'em. To be honest the sangria I had was average, nothing to write home about. But the poutine was good. Both are classics that are hard to screw up. Overall to me, this resto doesn't really stand out in any unique way. If you go, you will enjoy yourselves."
/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"We hit up Mange Moi for lunch today. It's a super easy go-to in the plateau for a quick lunch or dinner with great options for mason jar drinks. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and the American burger with salad and fries. Their menu also offers a long list of poutines and hot dogs. The vibes at Mange Moi are very comfortable and laid-back - Perfect for an anytime meal or late night take-out / delivery. The food strikes that balance between being comfort food and not being too greasy. Although we didn't order onion rings, sweet potato fries or milkshakes this time, I have had them all before and are excellent choices. The staff is always really friendly and manage the space well. Top-notch for burgers and poutines!"

/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I like, I adore, I will come back. Maybe often. Because when the food is well made, the service is impeccable and the ambiance is top, there is no reason not to! Mange-moi is an elegant poutinerie and one of those ""fancy-looking"" burger places that have been popping up around town recently. The decor is rustic modern, perhaps a little bit too ""right now"" and might go out of style in the future, but in any case it works, it's comfortable and fits the neighbourhood like a glove. It's small, with only about 5 x 2-person tables inside plus 10-15 single bar chairs around - perfect if you feel like rocking in solo. The burger and poutine menus offer a nice, classic variety. My choice was their ""Mont-Royal"" burger which is a beef burger with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, barbecue sauce, Boston lettuce and tomato. It was pure goodness, which I think owed a lot to the sweet burger buns that held everything together. The fries and the caesar salad were excellent as well, and of generous proportions. My husband and I shared the fries and the salad that came with my burger (he ordered only the burger), and it was more than enough. The alcoholic drinks menu is interesting too, though the cocktails at $12 a pop were beyond my dinner budget, so I didn't order any. Having said all those good things, my biggest compliments actually go to either the service or the music. It's a very tight race. We were served by one of the nicest, most competent servers I have ever encountered in a burger place. Aside from being very friendly, he topped up our glasses of water as often as needed (the glass was tiny) without us having to ask.  As for the music, when I was there that evening, they were playing an international remix of 80's dance/pop; there was never a dull moment, at least for me! It was so good I asked the server if they were playing their homemade CD because if it was, I would love to buy it. Sadly no, he said that it was from a satellite radio. Hands-down, best burger place in the Plateau Mont-Royal. Next time I will try their poutine!"

Think a slightly larger and more upscale/trendy Patati-Patata.  There's an L shaped bar, a few tables, and a few window counters.  There's a fully stocked bar (I'll have to return to sample a mason jar cocktail sometime), and a good selection of beers on tap (a combination of local and import).  The music was top 40, which normally I don't particularly care for, but somehow it worked.The service is friendly.  It took awhile for us to get our orders, but I chalk it up to the place being so busy at lunch time.  It didn't really matter, we were happy to just hang out and drink our beers.The food!  These were some awesome burgers.  We each had a burger, but no sides, and this was perfect for a nice lunch.  We left feeling satisfied, but not disgustingly full.  I had the lamb burger, and it was overly ""lamb-y"", and had a greek vibe going on.So overall, none of the individual components scream ""AWESOME!"", but it all just worked so well together, and was exactly what we felt like at that moment.This would make a great place to stop in for post work drinks and munchies."
/user_details?userid=lPbszXrXKPnRchbzwVbOIg,Steven V.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"We were looking for food and drinks in the Plateau Saturday night when it was freezing and it just wasn't working out. Either places weren't serving food any longer, or they were too restaurant-y or too clublike. We wanted something kind of in the middle that was also somewhere we hadn't been before.After trodding around for about 45min in the snow starving. We found this place at about midnight. It was warm, cozy, the server was very friendly. The menu had a lot of options. We got burgers and salads and ordered a bunch of drinks. We ended up staying for about 1.5hrs and had a really nice time. The owner and waiter were super nice too. My gf's salad had bacon in it, and she's a vegetarian and didn't notice that on the menu, the server said no problem, and the owner came out and made a whole new one with no bacon himself. No extra charge. Overall a really nice unexpected experience. I would definitely return. However it's not the kind of place I would actively cross town for though because it isn't the kind of place you would want to hang out all night. But for an hour or drinks and food, its great."

/user_details?userid=Afa1kxZD0GYDTLyh9TB0Bw,Thomas J.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Tried this place after being recommended it for their good burgers and poutines. I really like the rustic decor of Mange-Moi. The walls, floor, tables and bar have wood incorporated into the design. Very rustic-modern. I tried the burger with smoked meat on it and a poutine with ground beef. Both were delicious. The portion size is perfect. What I like the most about this place is that they serve both fries and salad with the burgers. I do think however that the menu is a bit on the expensive side for what you get, still really good food though! The drink menu seems way over priced.The reason I gave this place 3 stars was because during my visit I got REALLY bad service without going into much detail lol. I have heard that normally the service is pretty good though so maybe it was just a bad night for Mange-Moi. However, besides the bad service my friends and I really enjoyed coming here and will likely be back again soon!I will do an updated review once I go back again on the service."

I would give this place a much higher rating otherwise. I know lots of restaurant owners choose to play top 40 pop music because it is supposed to be inoffensive to the masses but I think we all know that is no longer the case. Everything else about this place seems really fresh and natural except for the fake robot voices screaming at customers from loud speakers in every corner. Please, I beg of you. Play something at least somewhat neutral in there, or at least turn it down so the music can be more easily blocked out by patrons who are offended by it. I know I am not the only one."
