So this time we decided to walk in the west direction and we found ourselves in front of Maman. They seemed to be doing a good job of following all the covid-19 safety guidelines: limit on the number of people inside, distance between the tables, and masks for the staff as well as the customers picking up food. We felt less anxious sitting there to eat. We got the Mediterranean breakfast and egg ratatouille (gluten-free and non-dairy) - they replaced the feta cheese and bread with roasted potatoes for me, which I thought was nice of them. Really enjoyed the food. I found a small piece of hair in my dish (which is fine, it happens sometimes). When I pointed it out to them, they immediately apologized and got me a slice of their gluten free pistachio cake, which I loved so much that I got another one for takeout. I really enjoyed my breakfast here. Also, our server was super nice. Definitely recommend it!"

From the moment you walk in it feels like you are entering a fairy tale, with beautiful vintage decor and mismatched furniture. The service is good and menu delicious! Tried the avo toast, sophia sandwhich and Yves salad- all absolutely delectable! Would not change one thing, and we were very well served in French!Highly highly recommend for a charming and delicious brunch experience!!"

Then I went for their croque maman à la truffe with an egg (they kinda had me at homemade bechamel sauce), the bread wasn't dry, the portions were gargantuan, I loved it! Now, my friend who was raised in the south of France, was more than happy to see items on the menu that were familiar to her palate and ordered the ratatouille... and didn't like her dish. She ended up giving it to me, and guess what? I loved it! To me it was mostly a matter of taste, or maybe because I'm not an expert in South of France cuisine lol.All in all, the service was great, the interior was fabulous, I'll be back for sure!"

Not sure why everyone was complaining about the service, we had no delay being seated, served and our water was always full even if it was busy. Either way Sunday afternoon is fine for service!As for the food it was really amazing. We had the egg ratatouille (vegetarian) and the breakfast sandwich which had the most amazing sauce in it. Would definitely recommend the sandwich! There were so many other great sounding dishes, will be back to try them!The decor is also very pretty! They have individual tables to sit at for 2 people and also large picnic tables. We sat at the big tables and it was very cozy and still felt private unlike some other restaurants which have communal tables. Very cute new spot in Griffintown."

Takes so long to get your order even if the place is not full, and the employees are just chatting amongst themselves while leaving you unattended.This place has potential but they need to fix their service.Great donuts & the most delicious cookies."

Friendly staff, good vibes, the food hit the spot too  I love a place that's genuine, isn't over the top for no reason, and this has just the perfect balance. Thank you guys!!! Keep it going, keep it real."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My high expectations was a let down. Maman is well known in NY, Toronto... is located in the heart of our Montreal, in Griffintown. It's a perfect spot; the restaurant is very charming with old and new mix of decors. It has the vibe of rustic feel and Victoria era. The service is initially super slow; a waitress attended us after 20 minutes of sitting with no water yet. The restaurant wasn't busy yet, but it got afterwards. After, ordering our drinks and meal; everything arrived promptly. My coffee is presented beautifully in Victorian cup with a saucer. The highlight was the creamer which is a bunny. Very adorable. As per the main dish, I had a sandwich called Jessalyn sandwich with greens on the side. The sandwich was with grilled halloumi, pickled onion, cucumbers, leek hummus and mint. The sandwich was good but halloumi was very salty, and the bread was hard to chew. The side salad's dressing was very bitter. My sister had a cappuccino and Florence salad with red quinoa, halloumi, squash, artichoke and harissa. Again, halloumi was too salty, and the salad was soggy because of too much dressing. Overall beautiful place, average service and below average food. In conclusion, I was happy to try this place though."

(I had literally slipped and fallen on an icy sidewalk about 10 minutes prior, which made me extra grateful for the warm service and atmosphere... )We loved the service. The extra touches like the latte art and fabulous baked goods at the front were just plain sweet. The menu was chock-full of healthy salads, as well as creative twists on traditional brunch dishes. (The portions are on the small side; this was fine with me, but this may not be the place if you are looking to get a big heavy breakfast.)Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious -- and please do not leave before trying the bacon jam! It's to die for! I only wish I lived closer so I could go there more often!"

I went in with a friend and we were in a bit of a rush, which we let the waiters know since in some places the wait times are a bit ridiculous. At Maman, the food was ready in 5-10 minutes and the waiters were very attentive and quick!  Also, the pricing was really good for such a fancy place. About the same as the big breakfast places like Allo Mon Coco or Cora's except the atmosphere and decor is leagues better. Recommending it to all of my friends!"
/user_details?userid=LB1dC42iB6WSjPVPwt3Zqg,Meg K.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Super cute restaurant located In Griffintown , in Montreal. I tried a latte with skim milk and had the traditional maman breakfast plate, while my friend has the Sofia sandwich and a black iced coffee. Both plates were super good! They served real maple syrup which made the pancakes yummy 10x better. Everything was really good and left there full. The environment was super nice and the waiters were professional. Their bathroom needs some work done but besides that I really enjoyed my visit and will return again in the warmer months"
/user_details?userid=Uoz7mnxLv9mn0qeCvxWscw,Kristopher F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place has so much potential to be the IT spot in Griffintown but is slowly squandering the possibilities. The food is absolutely delicious HOWEVER the service is extremely bad. Ordering a simple flat white/treat to go can take upwards of 15/20 minutes to complete. Some of the staff are totally unfriendly and unprofessional. The lead barista could care less if you lived or died waiting for your coffee. Her attitude is flat out the worse of them all. I get that they are new but I can see from other sources online, they aren't taking seriously the complaints of wait times and staff attitudes. I did try to call the owners/managers with my concerns before leaving review but my calls went unreturned. ‍"
/user_details?userid=95FpfvbxB35ucXcLe4uSMg,Anne B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent food and pastries but very disappointing coffee, which is a shame because they serve Parlour, which is usually delicious when done right (also hard to find in Montreal). The owners don't seem to know the correct way to make espresso based drinks. Instead of asking customers if they want single or double, they ask if you want a smalll, medium or large. My 'small' americano with milk tasted like watery milk. The cup was too large for a 'small'."
/user_details?userid=NrevV_Ku8WCNZC4tyzg7SA,Melissa S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went with 3 other people to try this new brunch place today. We arrived at 9:00 am so we wouldn't have to wait in line, and were seated immediately. The space is really nice, with a rustic garden feel. So far so good.Two of my friends ordered the pancakes with the lemon basil sauce. They were truly excellent. Crave worthy, unique and beautifully presented. I ordered the salad with the halloumi and artichoke. It was very good although a little light on the halloumi and a little heavy on the dressing. I also ordered the hashbrowns which were bland and kind of soggy.My other friend ordered the salad with the smoked salmon and asked if it came with hashbrowns, since she had seen it pictured that way on Instagram, but it was not mentioned in the description on the menu. The server said no so she ordered a side. When her dish arrived it did in fact have hashbrowns in it, and she ended up with double hashbrowns... so that was confusing. We also had regular filtered coffee which was decent. Unfortunately we were disappointed to learn that there is a no refill policy and considering that a cup is 3.50$, I'd say that's kind of crazy."
/user_details?userid=9XDn4w8IrEmxeZdXZciV_Q,Marcia T.,"Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace, Canada",2 star rating,I'm quite certain they can afford to put more then 2 marshmallows on their s'mores cookies. Smh. Overall it's unfortunate when establishments don't put care/effort into their service/product. Their name can only take them so far.

The service was second to none, warm and friendly and so down to earth and genuine. The food was innovative and delicious!!! A must try. I'll be back for sure."
