/user_details?userid=lv5TnHGfrSb_CIisOw0irg,Jay K.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Chambre à Part served me easily my favorite meal on my most recent trip to Montréal, a trip that included meals at heavy-hitting restaurants and long-time personal favorites such as Maison Boulud and Moishes, among others.While the interior décor of Chambre à Part is humble and replete with red bricks (another reviewer used the words ""shabby chic,"" which I think nails it), I couldn't think of a better place than Chambre à Part's patio to enjoy a meal in Montréal on a warm summer evening. Stephanie, my gracious bespectacled server, knew the menu backward and forward and is as good of a waitress as I'll ever deserve. She was patient with me and my non-gourmand friend, and literally needed to explain every item on the menu for him in English and in layman's terms while getting peppered with questions from me about where they're sourcing their medlar from. She took it all with a smile and maintained her composure throughout. Fortunately we came at opening and no one else was seated, so we had some time.My pal and I started by sharing the ""Duck Sausage Tart,"" which we both enjoyed. The duck sausage is crumbled and browned, and supplemented by crisp vegetables with a snappy dressing and crème fraîche. The flavors meld together well and this eats more like a stir-fry on top of what I'd consider more of a tostada than a tart, though it is excellent through and through.I also had the ""Hamachi Appetizer,"" which featured yellowtail sashimi marinated in sake, with jalapeño, beans, and radish slices. Almost every schmancy restaurant in North America seems to be doing something involving sashimi and jalapeño these days (thanks Nobu!), but few are leveraging Japanese medlar, a rare fruit on this side of the Pacific that brought a refreshing tartness to the dish.My entrée, the ""Guinea Fowl,"" featured fantastic artistry, with purple endive leaves arranged on top of the bird like feathers and clean semi-concentric streaks of sweet potato purée surrounding it. Since the Guinea Fowl is served without any sauce here, the mild sweet potato puree acted as an accompaniment for a few forkfuls of meat, not that it required anything else: every taste and bite of this 5-star entrée was well-seasoned, rich, and delicious. If you've never had Guinea Fowl before, this would be a good restaurant in which to have it first -- it tastes like pheasant, though milder. The tenderness of the meat was surprising, and the multiple textures on the plate made it as interesting dish to eat as it was flavorful.Rather than get dessert, my friend and I decided on a cheese course and we were not let down. Our consensus favorite was the butterscotch-like Wisconsin Bellavitano, which is hand-rubbed in espresso, contributing to a finish that is both smoky and sweet.Based on this stellar performance in both food and service, Chambre à Part has nudged its way into my regular rotation of restaurants to visit when I am in Montréal going forward.Food/Décor/Service: 4.7/4.2/4.7"

The food was amazing. Witty dishes consisted of well pair fresh, local ingredients. Everything was done really nicely. Do not miss this is you are in Montreal, it is well worth the trip"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately this restaurant did not live up to my expectations. I'll start off by saying that the restaurant is very cute and cozy! I like the brick wall and the caged lights hanging from the ceiling. It looks romantic. I came here with my brother and boyfriend on a Friday night. We each ordered a cocktail. They don't have names for their cocktails btw. I tried the Vodka Pur, pineapple, lime topped with arugula. My bro had the Bourbon Bulleit cocktail with peach, seabuckthorn which is an orange-colored berry, and black tea. My boyfriend had the Romeo's Gin, cucumber, mint, and wasabi. The latter really didn't taste like wasabi which is a good thing for me because I don't really enjoy the strong taste of wasabi. We all enjoyed our drinks and tried each others. Mine was refreshing and very light... almost just tasted like pineapple juice. The bourbon bulleit cocktail reminded me my bourbon lemonades that I was making all summer. We shared three starters: the mozzarella, the octopus, the terrine. The Mozzarella came with leek, Massawippi miso, panisse, jalapeño, kumquat (fruit similar to an orange). The Mozarella was good but piece of chees was pretty small. It wasn't spicy or sweet like you would think because of the jalapeno and kumquat. The grilled octopus, rugbrød (Danish style rye bread), gribiche sauce (mayo type cold egg sauce) , almond, radicchio, and vermouth Val Caudalie. The last starter was the quail, pork loin, snail, and savoy cabbage terrine. I was expecting a terrine that we would spread on bread but it was more like three circular terrine wrapped in a pastry. If I had to pick a favorite I would pick the octopus. In fact, these three starters were all very good and we expected the mains to be just as good if not better.  The night started off strong! The drinks and starters were so good... For mains my boyfriend ordered the duck with brussels sprouts, duck sausage, sweet potato, and mustard. My bro and I both ordered the venison with Jerusalem artichoke, leek, cocoa, and blackcurrant. The duck was ok but tasted to me like chinatown duck but he meat was thicker and chewy. The thinner part of the duck was cooked better and was tastier. The venison was a bit chewy and dry and not very flavorful. Also the portions are small. I left disappointed and not very satisfied. We ended up going out for a drink at 4e mur afterwards and then hit up AA for poutine!"
/user_details?userid=reI3blW64OdEMpQabgeUVQ,Emily B.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Amazing! I made this reservation on open table.  It was perfect for our bachelorette weekend.  The atmosphere inside was very cute! Also, the server was great.  He was very good at explaining the menu for us since we are fromAmerica and did not speak French.  The food was amazing! One of the owners even spoke with us briefly and gave us a few places to check out later that night.b"
/user_details?userid=sf5X5T3kqvJ-sJ2tzJ-y_w,Salem F.,"Arlington, MA",5 star rating,This was a gem that I found through yelp. Thanks guys! I came here for a 25 person business lunch. The staff was awesome. I cannot say enough about them. The food was fantastic (prix fixe menu) and the atmosphere was great. Our group really enjoying everything and we left full and happy!
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fairly new restaurant, was eager to try it. The waiter did a remarkable job explaining the menu and sharing his enthusiasm - which is why I gave this review 4 stars. I like that they're using local products for food and serve inventive drinks made with home made elements. It was a tad pricy, the presentation was great and the taste was good. I was not blown away like I wished for however. The descriptions sounded better than the results (which were not bad by any means, just not memorable good). Atmosphere and setting is beautiful. I'll probably give it a second try."
/user_details?userid=eoHmSfOX6LgsP8fo4dCLiw,Atessa A.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a brand new restaurant which opened last week. The setting and atmosphere will satisfy both a couple looking for a romantic dinner as well as a family or friends who would like to share a nice meal. The bar setting is really interesting and will accommodate groups who want a more private area. The banquettes are cosy with their nice fluffy pillows. The menu offers a wide variety of inspirational cocktails. They are some interesting mixes to try here and you can choose to have your cocktail with or without alcohol. I had the scallop appetizer and although it was small,  it featured a blossom of flavours and each bite was savoury.  As a main,  I picked the pan fried foie gras and once again was stunned by the many flavours which made my taste buds really happy.  We also had a side of croque monsieur which is not your typical as it is a mix of cheese between potatoes.  A real delight.My only hic was that I wish the portions were larger as the food was so delicious I would love to have a few more bites."
/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"TLDR: Phenomenal culinary experience of well thought out plates, kind service, and beautiful decor. I made the reservation for two for Saturday on Thursday, and they were still kind enough to take the time and confirm the reservation. In addition, they wanted to warn us that the restaurant would be noisier than normal as they had a group party. This extra step was something I truly appreciated.Chambre a Part is the sister restaurant of Fabrique next door, but their meals are much lighter, smaller, and delicate so that you can easily enjoy a three-course menu. Stephanie explained the menu to us with enthusiasm and brought us some home-made buckwheat flour bread. It was fluffy, sour, salty, goodness. When she asked if we wanted more I couldn't bring myself to say no.Our appetisers arrived and two stunning plates came sat in front of us. My friend got a vibrant hamachi plate, and I ordered the soup. My bowl came with chestnuts, slices of pear, and a chestnut pear confit. The parsnip soup was poured on top at the table. Every bite was a surprise pop of flavour and texture after mixing.The mains arrived, and they were displayed beautifully. My friend got the monkfish in a miso broth that looked delightful. What I ordered surpassed my expectations. My plate had a tender short rib that was beautifully pink inside and was easily cut with a fork. It was topped and sitting on a wonderful tagine spice au jus and crowned with golden brown chopped almonds. sitting next to it were adorable sauteed baby mushrooms. The left side of the plate consisted of the fluffiest pan fried gnocchi I have ever had and crispy shallot slices. It was topped with both French and Italian parsley for freshness. I had a hard time deciding what the last thing I would eat would be.Everything was so delicious, we had to try the desserts. The chocolate dessert came in the shape of a patterned crescent. The white chai mouse drop was followed by a grey smoked tea gel which was followed by a quenelle of chocolate mousse topped with a shard of white chocolate. The pattern repeated three times on the right side of the place and sat alongside chocolate gingerbread crumbs.The lemon dish consisted of a small, dense, syrupy, buttery, slightly bitter lemon cake. The drops of lemon mousse and candied almonds were the stars of the dish and were surrounded by peeled grapefruits and a mirliton compote. I would have been happy if with just the fruit, mouse, and almonds.The service was fantastic, with appropriate timing between each course so that we could fully enjoy the experience. The decor of the restaurant is stunning, and at the end of our meal, Stephanie was kind enough to give us the complete tour and history of the renovation of the restaurant. We arrived at 8:30 pm and left the restaurant at 12 and never once felt like we were being rushed out.Next time I will definitely try one of their drinks, specifically their non-alcoholic creations. Stephanie explained to us that they start with the mocktail first, and then they choose which alcohol best suits the virgin drink. They had an interesting selection including drinks made of tangy pineapple and peppery arugula.With tax, the meal came out to ~$46, which is quite fair for the wonderful experience we had that night. I highly recommend this restaurant for outings with friends and especially dates for foodies. They really care about the presentation and the balance of flavours and textures of every single dish. I am already looking forward to my next visit."
/user_details?userid=m_7elkDE_kTEh65xHt5y4w,Larissa L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A lovely experience! I found the place out of luck and thanks to Opentable and it felt like discovering a little secret. What a gem! We had a table on the cute terrace, but inside the place is so adorable I almost regretted stayed outside. Service was perfect, kind, extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Gave us great tips about the menu. Finally, food was delicious! Fresh, creative, very tasty. I will definitely come back soon!"
/user_details?userid=MsXA--Q5RPAJfY90uDNRBg,Pam M.,"Guilford Center, CT",5 star rating,"Embarrassed to admit, I found this gem because of Open Table.  I was looking for a spot for a group of co-workers and spouses on a business trip, it couldn't have been a better choice.  After a lot of expensive, average old Montreal restaurants, we wanted a memorable dinner and we found it!  It's got a farm to table, ""shabby chic"" feel and VERY cool.We sat at a long table outside and were greeted with the wonderful drink list made with the freshest ingredients - cucumber, wasabi, strawberries, basil, rhubarb..... which are paired with the right alcohol and absolutely delicious.  Our waiter, Justin, was attentive and on his game, he made it a perfect evening.  The menu is fresh - using fresh ingredients and a fresh twist.  The calamari app was divine - light and paired with cucumber, grapefruit... truly like no other.  We pretty much ordered the menu (which is very limited in a good way) and it was clean plates for all courses - apps, entrees, and desserts. The plates were beautifully styled and the flavor combinations delicious. The quality to value ratio is off the charts.  I highly recommend Chambre a Part, I only wish it was CT so I could frequent!.Best quote of the evening was ""I knew we were in the right place after I took the first sip of my delicious cocktail, and, I think I tasted every fresh ingredient used!"""
/user_details?userid=bDsV-2R4PEfvq7Q8cXHqKg,Emily L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This is a relatively new restaurant, but it is doing things right. A local friend highly recommended it while we were in Montreal for the weekend. It was so good, I would go back in a heartbeat.All aspects of the restaurant are impeccable. The manager was our server and he spent a great deal of time guiding us through the menu and chatting in between, making us feel quite welcome. A couple of us had various dietary restrictions, so he made sure we knew which dishes we could eat. I felt like I was eating something carefully crafted and delicious, rather than settling for a lesser option because of my allergies. Very much appreciated!As for the food and drinks, délicieux. Their cocktails (and mocktail for me) have freshly made juices, syrups, and locally-sourced ingredients creatively combined. The food menu is seasonal, so most of the dishes we had are no longer available. But I would be eager to see what they're offering now. The portions are a bit on the small side, so we each chose two dishes. I remember my squash soup was velvety with unctuous bits of bone marrow, and my beef medallions were perfectly flavorful. They even brought out some complimentary homemade marshmallows at the end. Yum!Decor-wise, you're swept into a serene greenhouse retreat, with natural wood, flowers, and a skylight in the back over the bar area.When we went, the dining room was somewhat empty for a Saturday night, but I hope it continues to do well so we can come back! Make a reservation just in case."
/user_details?userid=2av488ePvb-Z4qgeNDpWCg,Emilie M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place feels like it was entirely built from Pinterest. The decor is just perfect, with a cozy atmosphere, the loveliest plates, and tiny wildflowers on each table. If you're on a date night, ask to be seated on the corner tables where the armchairs are. The food is well thought, classy and has some sort of a feminin touch without being too much - and the boys will love the pâté en croûte and everything with foie gras.The servings are just perfect for you to enjoy a 3 course meal. Nice techniques, good flavors, very friendly staff. You should try it !"
/user_details?userid=xL7EpWJfKjeJdIc2obSySQ,Takumi S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to this restaurant for lunch, and it was great! The price ($18) was reasonable enough for their table d'hôte (soup + main dish). The food was very delicious and the service was nice. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also quite good. I highly recommend this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=RzNwfQIxlTBwEunGs-c0fQ,Kelly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"We were lucky enough to to make reservation at the last minute, because I think this restaurant is relatively new and not so many people know about it. Everything is so amazing, the appetizers, the entrées, desserts, and the service too! The portion is not large but it's satisfying. We have group of 8 and we all left pretty amazed and happy :)"
/user_details?userid=ltbdBWEMwBS61dRmUF0xkw,Adam L.,"Chandler, AZ",5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! Had the octopus appetizer with the foie gras stuffed quail as a main. Both dishes were flawless. The cocktails are interesting. You can order the drink without alcohol, or with booze for an extra cost. Service was very good, even with our large group of 15. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=l4T4jw1l25B0mdzuQYLdmQ,Ewa A.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Walked in here and I felt like I was walking into a shower of bird chirps and magic and golden glows and warm energy. I had dinner here on Valentine's night this year... And I realize I am writing this review many months after the fact.*But* I think about this restaurant often (despite the fact that the night I had dinner here was a special one). This restaurant enfolds you into a different world of small and thoughtful details. The owner happened to be our waitress (!!), and even though we were the last table she had for the night she was more than willing to talk with us about the food, our impression of the restaurant, and her visions for it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was unforgettably personal and warm. I am no connoisseur of food or red wine but our Chef's Menu that night was so tasty. The meat I had that night just fell apart in my mouth... And I won't forget the beet sauce that came with one of the dishes- it was just the right amount of tart and spice.I will be back one day to write a more detailed review of the food, but I was definitely lucky enough to stumble onto this gem. !!!!"

/user_details?userid=qUqyWV4DnxEChu1xk24DqA,Melissa A.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I had a solo dinner on the terrace here while my husband was away. I had a delicious gin and cucumber cocktail to start. I wanted the foie for my main but decided against after the server talked up the Jerome pate en croute which was delicious. I settled on the risotto for my main which was really light and tasty. The service was excellent. Everyone seemed happy to be there. I take a star off for it being a little pricey, but I would still recommend it."
/user_details?userid=l6jZznm2DV6eQDtQStCPfw,Amy G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,The food was delicious- small tapas sized portions- but with such detail to the blend of flavors and presentation- service was lovely- chairs were a bit uncomfortable though
/user_details?userid=O4gvv7v3dQidmW1NPsa-Iw,Stella C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Warm atmosphere. The waitress Melissa is gracious and friendly. The food is delicate yet absolutely delicious. They even accommodated my little request of making my boyfriend's birthday a little special by putting a candle and a piece of chocolate with ""happy birthday"" written on it. 10/10 would recommend."
