Couldn't have asked for a better combination. Everything was delicious
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"How can you go wrong with unlimited mussels for 19$? You can't ! We got there at 8 pm took a quiet table in the back of course wearing our masks and sanitizing our hands upon arrival.Appetizer of the duck wings really surprised me. They were DELICIOUS. I can't find anything wrong about them. Fall of the bone, saucy, meaty and dipping sauce was on point.Mussels were great they had 3 types of sauces the night we came. White wine, blue cheese and curry. The best was blue cheese.The food was very salty from the fries to the sauce but besides that it was a great all you can eat and a fun night out."

Nice ambiance, service was great. I ordered a cappuccino and it was quite underwhelming. My friend ordered the vanilla and chocolate pancakes and I ordered the hotdog. The pancakes were good but for the portion was a bit small. There were only two pancakes and it was served on a wooden board which made it tricky to pour maple syrup. I ordered the hotdog because I thought it was going to be a sausage. The waitress said the meat was a smoked pork sausage but it didn't taste particularly special. Overall we had a nice brunch but it wasn't anything special."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Average food and not so great service. We had a reservation during brunch time but still had to wait around 30 minutes to get a table as everyone in line also had a reservation. After sitting down, we were told we would only have an hour as it was very crowded, but that hour also includes waiting 10 minutes before getting our orders taken and then waiting for the food to arrive for 15 minutes. Although we did finish everything on time, the food is less enjoyable when you feel rushed like this. As for the food and drinks, they were very average and nothing tasted so great that it makes me want to come back."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food was pretty good. I tried the seal -- I've come to the conclusion that I don't like seal meat. It tasted a little gamey/fishy/iron-y. But that's not on them. You also get free bread and delicious berry + butter jam as a starter.The mussels were amazing and they give you a lot! Pea soup was nice. So were the fries! It's the nice, slightly sweet thick fries you often get with poutine in Quebec. However, the food took quite a long time to come. When I asked to pack my food up, they gave me one container for me to pack up my pea soup and my leftover fries...and then it took about another 10 minutes before I was able to get another container to put my soup separately. The bill also took about 20-25 minutes to arrive, despiting asking for it from 2 different waiters. The waiters were all nice and kind folks when I was able to talk to them/get their attention, it's just that everything was a bit slow. Also did not get a refill on our waters at the table during the entire 2.5 hours we were there. Would not recommend going during a work lunch break (which I did)."

As a visitor to Montreal, a friend of ours local to Montreal described this place as truly Quebecois. Very casual vibes, a bit uncomfortable during the summertime since they didn't have the AC on and it was quite hot in the main dining room. Service was very attentive and the servers were very good at giving us food tips and dropping food gems.Must-haves: deer tartare, seal, and boar, and the boudinAbsolutely adored the deer tartare - great flavour and wonderful texture. If you like liver, the seal is very interesting, not dry at all but quite juicy. Had the boar to share with my boyfriend and it was so moist and the portions were huge. It was perfect that we shared an entree instead of getting our own. MUST GET the BOUDIN - absolutely incredible and one of the best I've ever had."

Service: friendly, helpful, quick and enthusiastic. Decor: wildlife feelingFood: very delicious! As an entree I had shark tartare. It was Flavorful.  As my main dish, I had steak with chimichuri sauce on the side garden salad and fries... it was perfectly cooked... it was one of the best steak I had.Conclusion: recommended!"
/user_details?userid=HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"Why is this place so highly rated? It is brunch fare that is something I can cook at home with spinach, bacon and a poached egg.Nothing to write home about, frankly. I liked the spiced wine and the blueberry smoothie and I'm glad I didn't overpay for what I got. It was kind of disappointing."
/user_details?userid=fw7GQ34xVS3cZpuV5UmMFA,Irene D.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",5 star rating,"What a place! Food was so good and different. They make their own breakfast sausages and they are definely worth the try.I tried the elk breakfast burger (unfortunately I don't have a picture) and and I HIGHLY recommend it!The sweet and salty pancakes were a bit too sweet for my taste, but the pancakes were so fluffy and soft.You should go!Oh and they take reservations good brunch"
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"When a Groupon came up I figured I would bother with the trek as I am rarely in the area. Double dated with my roommate and I have got to say, I was actually embarrassed to have brought them here for our celebratory meal. The ""discount"" was paying $100 instead of $200 for a ""4 course"" meal for 4 people but if we had actually paid $50 +tax/tip/drinks per person we would have been beyond annoyed at the lack of bang-for-your-buck.The service was fine. The waitress could spout off the menu details like no ones business and was very informative and friendly, however her flow of service was lacking. It took nearly 3 hours for this entire meal to go down. We were often sitting quite a bit between courses, had to flag our server a few times and sat with our empty dessert trays far too long while trying to get our bill (we were the last table of the night no less!).The food itself was discouraging. The foie gras option was removed from our menu, seems as though they have since decided that it comes at an extra charge. The brie appetizer was the high point of the meal but that should be a slam dunk considering it was just a baked wheel of brie purchased elsewhere so all they had to do was warm it up and top it with bacon and apple slices. The ""Sorbet"" was cranberry seeds in liquid (not frozen) which pretty much resulted in us all having a shitty tarty ""martini"". The butcher's piece of the day was bavette with blue cheese so my hopes were high. The cut itself had great potential, but was flavorless and one of the two was delivered charred while still being under-cooked. The fries were so poorly made that they were in big clumps and the blue cheese sauce was overly flavorful while still being watery and colorless which left me hesitating to think if it was home made or chemicals from a bottle. The brownies were hard and dry which anyone plating it should have noticed, and would have required far more than the bottle cap sized scoop of ice cream to salvage it. Overall, we would have been better staying home and popping in a frozen pizza, it's to that point that the meal didn't serve a value. Trekking from Lachine for this meal had me feeling pretty stupid.Honestly, had it not been for the brie, the meal would have been a complete write off. I hope that one day I'll be in the area during brunch hours because it seems like that might be their forte. Yelp food photos definitely hyped this place up. I would definitely suggest skipping this place for supper. Menu looked great but was a total let down."
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We had a great visit to this restaurant during Mtl a Table! The restaurant decor is very cozy - you feel like you are in a posh wood cabin! It was a cold night but the double doors kept us warm, despite being right near the entrance.All of the dishes were very tasty. My husband had the seal tataki appetizer, which was definitely a first! The trout was cooked perfectly, with a delicious maple-beer glaze. The brownie was very decadent, but I found the nougat dessert to have too many nuts.There was a beer/wine pairing that was available, but it did not seem like a good deal relative to the normal pint prices.Service was great. The server was patient as we practiced our French but was sure to clarify things when she knew we did not understand. Great choice!"

My fiancé and I are visiting from Nashville, TN and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality, taste and presentation of the our brunch items. She ordered the sweet and salty pancakes while I when with the hearty Elk Breakfast Burger. We're happy with our choice to come here instead of waiting in line at other options close by."

/user_details?userid=PqI494Hy7C3hZIVaGpc2vg,Emy P.,"St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada",1 star rating,"Very disappointing service over the phone that doesn't give me the push to visit them in person. I called at 8:59PM to see if I could go grab a few bites and asked what time they closed. They said 10PM and then I asked if I could pass by quick but said that they weren't taking tables after 9PM...I guess it doesn't close at 10PM, it just does at 9PM. So next time, stick to 9PM and don't get people's hopes too high. It's always better to over deliver. Maybe one day I'll visit but not for a while."
/user_details?userid=VUrzBsD2EnuVEFU1c74Etg,Jamie L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Brought in by the oyster festival with the offer of a dozen oysters and a glass of wine for a $10. Stayed for the best Scottish style black pudding north of the St Andrew's Society Robbie Burns Dinner as well as a taste of foi gras. Could not have been happier with he food or the service.I will return when next in this great city.
/user_details?userid=k5VVrlRJp1eqonVXrWHKOw,Patricia B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,We went in for a spontaneous dinner. The decor and ambience was pleasant. We ordered the bison tartar special of the week. Very tasty!As a main course we had a plate of mussels and a plate of fish.Unfortunately the mussels even though generous in size had a bitter taste once you reached the ones covered in sauce. The onions had been burned. We pointed it out to the waitress to make the cook aware and were told we should have mentioned this earlier. And then were asked if we wanted some extra bread for the sauce?!I do recommend trying their beer on tap!
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went to this restaurant during MTL a Table and I have to say, I'm a big fan of the decor! It feels like a cosy log cabin, which is perfect for cold November evenings. Their cocktails are original (and have the best names), but there's unfortunately not a very extensive choice of beer. I found it odd that a restaurant priding itself on featuring Quebec delicacies would not have more local microbrewery beers on the menu (especially considering Dieu du Ciel is not far away).Seal tataki was cooked perfectly (just raw enough), but poorly seasoned and poorly trimmed. I had a huge slice of 100% seal fat. In contrast, the trout was very good; loved the multicolored veggies accompanying it, it was simple and efficient! The brownie was (of course) to die for, a perfect way to finish the meal. However, I think the best surprise was the nougat! I could've ordered a second one, it was delicious! Good choice for a casual night!"

/user_details?userid=E8N-hgXND7_wUGOA5u9jKA,Howard G.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"Great location......great service......nice restaurant........maybe brunch isn't their thing. This is an area with some of the best brunch places in the city, Sparrow, Lawrence, Larry's, etc. all within a few short blocks of each other on St-Laurent. If you're going to open for brunch you need to step up your game and make it amazing. There were only 2 other diners in the restaurant with us but all the other places were packed with people standing in line. The food here was very average, that being said I've heard very good things about their dinners. I had the 'Caribou Breakfast', which looked incredible when it got to the table and had several different items on the plate, but each item was mediocre at best and nothing really stood out for the $19 price tag. The mini sugar-cinnamon donuts with chocolate dipping sauce were good. Overall, I'd like to go back there and try dinner but brunch has too many other great places across the city."
