They have been opened for, well... a very long time! A small family business with a big serving on customer service. I can't emphasize enough that I live far from Montreal. Especially for just a few specialty ingredients. So when I want a nice piece of otoro, I would give them a call and they gladly put a quality piece aside for me! They have really interesting ingredients that you can't find in any other Asian markets. So... sushi and sukiyaki tonight anyone?! :)"
/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a cute little place!! I love me a grocery store that also has prepared foods. It's one of the closest thing we get here to Asian 7-Eleven's. They sell a range of different Japanese and some other Asian foods, sauces, ingredients, as well as some home decor/dining sets. Place is immaculately clean and I love their covid setup so that you enter one way, and it loops around the whole store so you can exit by the cash register. There's one man holding up the fort in the middle by the cash register, and a woman making sushi and other prepared foods behind this pretty open concept glass display. Prices are a bit on the higher side, and since I'd been craving sushi, I got a set of large sashimi rolls for $9. They were ok, but for a grocery store they hit the spot. I love that they're located right next to restaurant park and in my romantic musings I hope they're often collaborating, cuz who doesn't love when local businesses partner up to make amazing foods."

You have a plethora of Vietnamese and Chinese grocery stores. A few Korean places that also have Japanese selection. Plus Marche Hawaii ""Variety Asian"" (where they do have Japanese ingredients) but Miyamoto is the first all Japanese grocery store I've found in MTL. It's small (think depaneur size) and is located just a south of Sherbrooke in the posh area of Westmount. Almost right next door to Park restaurant. Japanese culture has its different nuances and intricacies. I'd compare the Japanese to the Germans (or possibly maybe more the Swiss). They also do have their strong differences. They both tend to be über organized cultures, work and live in an efficient society and business organizations run like clockwork. I believe North Americans could learn a lot about the Japanese. It's a culture I really enjoy for many reasons food included. They did have some more specific Japanese ingredients that I haven't seen elsewhere (hanakatsuo- bonito flakes for that okonomiyaki, takoyaki sauce and other harder to find Japanese sauces and ingredients. A very good selection of sushi rice, table wear, chopsticks rests and home cook wear. They have the Japanese brands zojirushi which have some of the best rice cookers and thermal cookware on the market you can buy. They also had very delicious looking fresh sushi. Also interesting enough frozen prepared meals. The one that intrigued me was a beef rendang. However at $14.75 for a small package?  I decided to pass. A great selection of fresh ingredients also. Pricing is a bit more premium than other places but this is Westmount and I'd claim his selection is bountiful. I will come back and test out the sushi and perhaps other food items.  I wonder if Antonio Park comes by here if he's missing some ingredients? Cool little shop."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the few Japanese grocery stores in Montreal.It is located next to Park, a pretty famous restaurant by Chef Antonio Park.Miyamoto carries a great variety of Japanese food-stuff, ranging from prepared meals to tea to snacks. I went there specifically to buy a ""Candy Sushi Kit"", which I saw on YouTube once (look it up, its really funny). It's just one of those things only the Japanese can come up with. We also checked out the rest of the merchandise. Prices were a bit high, especially for many items that can also be found in Chinatown. We bought some delicious japanese rice balls (onigiri) and left.A small, cute store, probably very popular in its neighbourhood!"

The variety of products is amazing: everything from soup to nuts, literally! The fresh fish and beef are not to be missed. Most of all the staff is friendly and helpful."
/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,Mini supermarket focused on Japanese products. I tried their take out Sushi box freshly made upstairs. The ingredients were very fresh and the rice well prepared. Price was very reasonable. I'll be back for more.
/user_details?userid=ro1Wabvc7q1oM0PapbOWDQ,Gabriela S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious sushi - huge pieces and no so traditional but really good with lots of fish and less filler. Also the staff is super sweet and helpful.Once, I was looking for fermented bamboo to garnish my ramen (harder to find than you think) and when I went in there the guy at the cash found it in a second and then told me how he liked to eat it. It's always a positive experience going in there.Bonus points for picking up green tea KitKat on your way out!"

/user_details?userid=4HktcibKVGtsxSx8gJ56GA,Sandra P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Best Japanese grocer in Montreal! Their prices can be a little steep, but they carry products you can't find anywhere else in the city.  The place to go if you're looking for myoga, fresh wasabi root, good-quality mirin or brown rice vinegar. They also sell tableware, benriner mandolines, and japanese knives. Their prepared food (onigiri, suhshi, various salads, rice dishes, and soups) is consistently tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced."
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Miyamoto is a small and quaint Japanese grocery store. They sell sushi and Zojurushi water boilers and lunch jars so that's a plus.In case you guys don't know what Zojurushi is, it's a Japanese brand that makes super good quality products. My mom bought two lunch jars from them in the 70s and it still works well. Anyway i'm digressing. Point is, if you live around the Westmount area, near Vendome or sherbrooke ish  and need Japanese products, go to Miyamoto, it has all the basic Japanese products. (curry, japanese mayo, seaweed, sushi knives, green tea cookies and snacks)"
