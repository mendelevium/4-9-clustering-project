/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Referred by my friend.I asked if there is a similar restaurant as Tinuno in Toronto.La Republika is very close. They offer currently only take out. The plate is pretty huge. But unlike Tinuno. The rice is white rice instead of garlic rice. You need to ask and pay for garlic rice.For the grilled squid, sadly it's not a whole squid. Only few pieces. But it's tasty.Few options available on the menu. They should call ahead to order. It may take up to 30 minutes to prepare.Compare to Tinuno, the price is expensive.Overall:Taste 4/5Price 3.5/5 (~$100 to feed four people)"
/user_details?userid=eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",5 star rating,"The Good:Overall delicious foodOpen kitchenGood serviceThe Bad:Nothing really, perhaps lack of ambianceThe skinny:Go for it, even for those not familiar with this cuisineI just read a large recent poll that Filipino Food was the near the bottom of favorite foods in the world.  They must not have had my late mom's cooking or food at La Republika. Either way, they would've polled way way higher. Too many people mention Balut, the boiled duck embryo egg with baby feathers and dinuguan, the pork blood in vinegar with coconut milk with chitlins as perhaps  among the most well-known gross out foods of the world.  Even if they only knew pancit (noodle disk) and egg-roll  cousin ""lumpia"" the world might be impressed.. However, most FIlipino restaurants in So. CAL and elsewhere are mostly turo-turo which means point-point for what you want in tired Filipino food, cafeteria style,steam tables. So La Republika was a breath of fresh air.   There is patio seating as you enter.  If you want to eat inside, like on a very cold winter's day, a rainy day, or a sweltering summer day, you might prefer to eat indoors.  There are some tables as you walk inside with meh ambiance, and another nicer back room. It's not really an intimate, romantic place. But the complaints stop there.   This is an open kitchen, so you can see if someone is doing something bad like some restaurants do behind closed doors, i.e. accidentally dropping then picking food from the floor and serving it...or spitting on the food of an impolite diner.  Yes, it happens.  But here, no worries because you can see everything happening.  Better year, you can see your food being made to order. Service was prompt and courteous.  When my super cute little nephew started in on the halo-halo (mixed preserved fruits, evaporated milk, crushed ice, and ice cream, the wait person nice instructed him and his mom,  ""It's better if you mix everything first...if you don't you only taste the crushed ice"" We started off with the lumpia appetizer.  It was good but simple.The 2-piece grilled chicken was excellent, with dark meat marinated and grilled, served with rice and sauteed zucchini.  I loved the chicken wings appetizer, moist on the outside.  Had it with a side of rice.  French fries were excellent, as was the citric infused pancit with red bell peppers, cabbage, and radish in boiled rice noodles, then mixed with chicken broth.  The food was not totally old school, but some modern improvements in the food was delicious.  We shared the halo halo desert.  Total cost was $55 before tip.  Excellent place.  I'd make this a permanent go to place if I lived here."

The food was flavourful, the ambiance was cozy (it's a tiny little spot) but the dessert left a little to be desired. I think the original Halo Halo would have been more my thing!"

/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cannot recommend this place enough and have taken numerous friends/family here because it's a fun experience overall!Ordering the Boodle Fight platters is a great way to have everything taken care of for you. The Bonifacio Feast is my go to -- it has a great variety of well-barbequed meats, rice, and to tie it all together, there's ice cream at the end! The pork skewers are AMAZING. It's slightly sweet and goes super well with the rice. The chicken wings I always end up also ordering an appetizer of as well because they're so good and disappear way too quickly. You can also a Halo Halo here, either as a dessert or as something to accompany your entire meal. You mix up what they give you in the mason jar (consisting of a variety of sweet ingredients) and it's a nice, cool dessert to enjoy. Their pancit palabok was also very yummy! And thoroughly enjoyed their salmon tartare as well. And their lumpia (egg rolls/spring rolls) are also a sure win. The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the squid. Which tasted a little bland to me. But there are so many other amazing options on the menu that it doesn't bother me to avoid that one dish!"
/user_details?userid=puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,Jason H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Pancit Palabok crispy noodles with shrimps and annato sauce was delicious.  It was so good and I was so hungry didn't even get a pic.  Annato sauce was like a gravy for crispy noodles very different and worth a try.  After that I had the lechon kawali deep fried pork with tomato and rice. Pork bits with tomato was very salty and crispy. Family owned and very nice atmosphere.  Everyone was super friendly the chef was a great singer Filipino karaoke styles lol would definitely go back again.

This is my first time eating in a filipino restaurant and had no clues nor expectations. My friend ordered a grilled chicken and it tasted like home to me, which is a great thing (i'm cambodian and my parent makes really good bbq food). I ordered a dried noodle with seafood (it reminded me of vietnamese's nid d'oiseau/bird nest). It comes with a special sauce that you pour into your bowl. It was interesting too."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A tiny little gem in Côte Des Neiges area, where we got invited for a boodle fight. The service is very efficient and friendly. In my head, the boodle fight is table setup for people to eat together from a plate (consisting banana leaf). But in this restaurant the boodle fight is shared by two people. Since, I am a pescatarian, I shared a seafood/fish platter with my sister. And my friends shared meat platter. In my platter, there were a full sea bass grilled, shrimps, fried calamari, salmon sashimi, with zucchini, coleslaw salad, tomato/onion salsa, and rice. All I can tell you... it was OMG!!! Every single item on my platter was so flavorful and delicious. Did I mention the presentation of each platter was extremely stunning... then it was fun to dig in to make a mess, because it made my mouth and belly very happy. Each platter is 50$, so it comes to 25$ person which is 100% worth it! Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food was good, especially the lumpiang and the eggplant salad, but the grilled squid was underwhelming because it lacked seasoning (which I haven't experienced before at a Filipino restaurant). However, I would like to try the boodle fight because it seemed like most people were ordering that and it may be a better choice. The service was really slow, and it was extremely hot the day we visited, with no air conditioner. There were some fans but it seemed like certain clients had turned them to relieve themselves. I was disappointed, to be honest, and so was my companion."
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the 1st Filipino restaurant I've tried in Montreal, although I am familiar with their food. I took some pancit to go and I have to say it was really good. It comes with a few pieces of crispy chicken which was fresh and delicious. While I was waiting for my food, I took a look a what others were eating and I have to say I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu."
/user_details?userid=J7TvcMYPgkDaeGHAqWy2eA,Mayer T.,"Waterloo, Canada",5 star rating,"C'est bon & délicieux. This was a nice surprise to find in the Côté de Neige area of Montréal. If you want a blast into a Filipino past with a cleaner modernized twist, visité ici!This first experience invited us in with an open patio and doors to la rue complete with modern tunes. We ordered the Lumpiang Shanghai (1 order is 6 pieces), Sisig Tacos (1 order is 2 tacos), Garlic Fried Rice, BBQ pork on a stick, Lechon Kawali, Lèche Flan and a fried Halo Halo.The Lumpia known as Filipino Spring Roll seems hand rolled and tasted good with the accompanying sauce. Sisig tacos tasted clean and made a traditionally messy food easy to eat with your hands - remember to squeeze that lime & lemon on! Best of all, it wasn't spicy which traditionally it is. The garlic fried rice could use a little more frying to create the dark brown crispy bits known as "" fond "" and more fried garlic but was still tasty, why wouldn't it be when it's covered in margarine. Pairs well with the not too sweet but well seasoned BBQ pork - my only ask would be more of the char on each stick. The carrot and reddish relish helps cut the fat yet, needs more of a punch of sour!The Lechon Kawali was great and clean and light even though it's deep fried pork complete with the crunchy rinds - have it with the vinegar with chili to cut through the fat and the soy vinegar to bump up the flavour! My favourite dish, the Pancit Palabok seafood noodle dish surprised and delighted me because they used crispy fried rice noodles rather than traditional boiled noodles which solves the traditionally over soggy nature of this dish - you will need to pour the seafood annatto sauce over the crispy noodles. For dessert the fried halo halo was a banana coconut jam turron (banana & coconut spring roll) with ice cream and a sweet ube purée underneath served with a slice of flan instead of the traditional shaved ice version that ends up more like a bubble tea. Their lèche flan was good but don't expect the super creamy variety - their interpretation is more spongy but everything was balanced. Time will tell if this place continues to produce consistent  quality and tasty good in a friendly, clean and inviting atmosphere. I hope it does. This is not a fast food place, expect to be seated and take your time getting and eating the food, it takes time to make good food - Bon Appétit!"
/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid authentic food from Philippines. It is clean with attentive service. The prices are mid range. Make sure you upgrade from normal rice to fried garlic rice and to taste their grilled chikens , livers, pork skewers and pork BBQ ribs.They also serve the ""boodle fight"" dish for two persons and with no prior reservations. It's a special meal and resturants normaly prefer to prepare it only for big groups with prior notice of 1 or 2 days!I definitely want to come back soon to try more of their dishes"
/user_details?userid=gm3r3B1X1xeKbdWLWL6c2Q,Reny L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The place is small yet inviting and relaxed. Service is attentive and professional.  I love their interpretation of typical Filipino food. This is not your mother's cooking.  It's a trained chef, that offers a progressive style to familiar manila dishes.  I love our Pancit Palabok that you pour the warm sauce when served. And dry Halo Halo, yes dry.  Seeing the Boodle dishes (Large combo plates for 2), I had one of those culinary moments.  Absolutely delicious and inspiring.  Tres Encroyable!"
/user_details?userid=gHpMlgQFQB8D8_JzOY_1YA,Anthony S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My first time at La Republika. Great service, friendly staffs. Open kitchen restaurant helped me ordering dishes that I wasn't sure. The food is good in general (except the grilled seabass and that the bbq chicken & pork skewers are a little burnt). I like the Benifacio boodle fight.. the lechon kawali is great! I recommend pork adobo. I would come back for it."
/user_details?userid=spJE9vaiBUb63jLuZyl9_A,Leonor D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very authentic Filipino food! We will definitely come back! They were playing some Filipino songs when we went. It was a Sunday so there's a lot of people. Food is really good! We were trying to find a good Filipino restaurant for while now and I think we already found one!
