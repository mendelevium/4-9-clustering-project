The wine list is endless. The food is delicious. And the atmosphere is perfectIt's a great place to bring a first date or simply to just have a date night.Keep in mind, the food is miniature lol Really. It's delicious, but the quantity is very small."
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a 4.5 star review.Pullman is a trendy wine bar that offers a selection of tapas and an extensive wine menu.On Sundays, all their drinks and bottles are 1/2 off which ensures that the restaurant is busy, even on a normally slow night.Service was very warm and friendly, and the waitress was knowledgeable. Tapas are very small. I think about 6-7 should be sufficient amongst 2 people."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"3 solid stars, and that's ok. For the most part, the food at Pullman is quite tasty. There are some standouts, but also some duds. Anytime you go through 8 or 9 full pours of various wines, you're going to have a good time. That doesn't mean that I'm going to hand out 5 stars like candy on Halloween. Our waitress was exceptionally friendly and helpful with wine selections and menu explanations. We were seated on the second level at a small table for two that has one bench seat and another cafeteria style perch/stool. I have to agree with some of the previous reviews that the furniture is quite run down. There are dried stains on the seating upholstery and mismatched patches of fabric which seem to have been swapped for damaged ones. The wall adjacent to our table had dozens of white pockmarks indented into the otherwise grey coat of paint. The tables are extremely close to one another and you will likely be pulled into your neighbours' conversations which can be fun up to a certain point. It can also be highly annoying and intrusive. Our neighbouring table was cool and kept the chatter brief and friendly. Another table at the far end of the room was not as lucky and had to endure the incoherent loud babbling of an annoying drunk lady who undoubtedly found herself extremely interesting with every additional glass of wine she consumed. The direct recipients of said babbling looked like they had been taken hostage with forced smiles and the like.For the two of us, we ordered 7 small plates which was the perfect amount of food. We started with the parsnip bhajis served with a traditional cucumber raita. They were tasty, and similar in texture to what you'll find at any Indian restaurant. Next we opted for the homemade Russian gravlax served with quail eggs and blinis alongside chopped onions and a little fish roe. The presentation of the plate was beautiful. The blinis were a bit bland. The gravlax was quite subtle as it should be.Next we had a scallop crudo dish which was muted. It lacked that intensely fresh flavour that I would have expected. Also, it only really tasted of EVOO with very little else. It was supposed to be flavoured with citrus, but I didn't taste very much acidity. I think I was spoiled when I tried Joe Beef's epic version of this dish earlier this year. The star of the night was the lobster ravioli in a tarragon cream sauce. For 16$, you are only getting 4 pieces of ravioli which I find lacking in value. The ravioli did however contain what tasted like very fresh lobster as well as some rich seafood stock. Served in a rich cream sauce, we mopped up the dish with bread until it was clean. To make me perfectly content, they would either bring the price down to about 12$ or throw in 2 more raviolis. Next came the tuna tataki served mysteriously on a bed of panko. This tuna tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer earlier in the day. Seared on the outside, it was a letdown almost completely lacking in taste and texture.Finally, we finished strong with the grilled cheese and the bison sliders. The grilled cheese is extremely buttery, crunchy, and potent. It is well worth the price of entry with a port-infused cheese. My wife (who had been to the restaurant 10 years earlier) was clearly rekindling her past relationship with this sandwich, and was in her happy place.The interior of the bison sliders was quite tasty, but unfortunately, the diminutive burgers were overshadowed by an overly bulky and tasteless bun. If it was toasted, it was done very minimally. I would have liked to have seen a bun grilled in butter and better matched in size to the contents of the burger. The matchstick fries were done very well, but should be served alongside some sort of aioli or ketchup. Some people  like to eat fries with nothing on them. I'm not one of those people. I need a little dip in my life; even on a matchstick fry. For dessert, the churros were very well done. They were crispy on the outside, but retained some inner moisture. Served alongside some rich chocolate sauce, this is a fun dessert upon which to end this sort of meal. The brownie with walnuts and cream cheese dip was average. While it's still dessert, it would never be a finalist in any baking competition.It was a fun meal, but certainly not firing on all cylinders. This establishment might be due for a bit of a revamp both in terms of the decor and the menu. I'd return at some point and try some different dishes, but I'm not in a particular hurry given how many spectacular restaurants are available to Montrealers on any given night. I wish them continued success as generally speaking, I really enjoy tapas style dining."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far one of my favourite wine bars in Montreal! Not only is the selection of wines outstanding, the staff is super knowledgeable as personable, and the food is always amazing. During my last visit, the girls and I ordered a bottle of orange wine ""Rkatsiteli"", which was amazing, and a whole bunch of plates to share starting with a charcuterie board, and then the octopus, tuna tataki, grilled cheese, bison sliders, and duck. We finished off with all three desserts on their menu including the churros, truffles, and apple beignets. Every dish was super tasty, well prepared and well seasoned; I fell in love with their grilled cheese and the truffles were perfection! We where having such a great time, thanks to the great laidback vibe of the place, that I didn't even get a picture of everything! Let's not forget the service which was super professional, friendly and quick! The wait staff knows their menu and more importantly, their wine. I've been to this spot multiple times and this surely wasn't my last. Their wine list and seasonal plates are changed up frequently so you'll always find something new to try; trust me you won't run out of wine options when you see the book of wines they present you to choose from. Can't wait to go back already!"
/user_details?userid=WPRv2imSrOjGHABNZ9vj-w,Jessica K.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",5 star rating,"Adorable spot! Came here for a date night with my husband and it was exactly what we were looking for. We tasted 6 different wines which was fun and interesting. Our server (Emmanuel - probably spelled her name wrong?) was very knowledgeable and really helpful. We ordered 2 dishes - spicy nuts (haha) and churros. Both were really good. Atmosphere has a cool but intimate vibe - chandelier is made from wine glasses! We would absolutely recommend this place for a date night or just an evening out with friends. The service we experienced was excellent and it is so fun to try different wines. I would recommend ordering several plates, as the portions of the plates are on the small side. Perfect for snacking, but you would need several for a meal. Overall, we loved it!"
/user_details?userid=SGrcsnOv6NzaZA10S4Q6SA,Alexandra G.,"Quincy, MA",4 star rating,"We came here on our first evening in Montreal. The service was great, and so was the food and drinks as well. The charcuterie board was awesome. We also ordered a few other appetizers, and our server helped us pair the food with some local brews that we wouldn't be able to get in the US. The downside, it was pretty loud and dark in this place, however, it didn't feel out of place or unusual given the atmosphere and environment they were creating, and the clientele they catered to."

I really missed le Pullman and I was happy to see they kept their casual style and good food. The 2oz pour option of By the glass is the best, there's a lot of choices, some better than the others but something for every palate. I love to try different  wines in the same evening. Pullman I've missed you. I promess i'll try to come more often."

We were visiting from NYC and they were quite busy. Still, they accommodated is at the upstairs bar. The thing we loved aboUt Pullman was that we explained to our waiter wines that we liked and he came back with glasses tailored to each of us - this continued throughout the night, each glass more interesting than the last. We weren't hungry but we were having such a great time we decided to order some food. Each of the small plates were excellent and we cannot wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=4e8KmxmjsaNBYZkNh_a0lA,Simone E.,"Quartier des Spectacles, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"While the food at Pullman was delicious, the service was terribly slow. It is also worth mentioning that the manager could not have been more unpleasant. We were frequently left looking around if not for our server, but someone to attend to us. The food is great but unfortunately the service will ruin your experience."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been meaning to go to this wine bar for a while. The area it is situated makes it stick out like a soar thumb. Why would a swanky place like this be there. Anywho, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The waitress who served us was on point with her knowledge about the wines. We had the grilled octopus and a white wine she recommended and the pairing was so tasty. Subsequently, she made us discover a Pinot noir from Switzerland called l'orage, I mean so cool...The Pinot was fantastic too. The only downside is that in these wine bars their selections are imports. Therefore, forget about finding it at the SAQ."
/user_details?userid=P5uRLwVRpv8OGv1eEvpvhQ,Natalie H.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"I really wanted to love this spot. Kudos for great seating concepts.  The wine list is extensive, 2oz pours would let you try and sample more but they do run in the 8ish dollar range. We did the larger pours of 2 kinds and 2 cocktails. They were good but not great cocktails. We waited a bit long in between as we had said give us a minute. It was a very long minute. The food was excellent but was always served 2 items at a time. We had the gourgeres, the mini sliders, the tartare, and some octopus.  The food was excellent.  Definitely yummy and I would have liked it more of the service was better.They made a minor mistake on our bill, corrected it but the error was in their favor so we were charged more. Not bad just not great."

/user_details?userid=Q7JWDxkeVsZPBsLHr-jN-A,Who C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Rating would be closer to a 3.5 if such a thing existed.We shared 5 tapas and 2 trios of wine, everything was good but nothing blew me away. The octopus, lamb and tuna tataki were our favourites, but I would pass on the flavourless deer tartare. We don't know much about wine, but the explanations were simple though pretentious and full of obscure terminology as it can be. We were in the downstairs section which can be a bit dark and crammed on busy nights, but not a bad atmosphere nevertheless.Overall it was a pleasant experience, but I wouldn't go back."
/user_details?userid=YWp4BoOSFv45UlpjV3Eo_g,Kitwa N.,"Malden, MA",5 star rating,"Wonderful tapas place with great food and excellent service. We walked in without a reservation late Friday evening and were promptly seated in the bar area. Attentive service all night from the bartender, who recommended a local IPA my husband loved! For food, we ordered: seared scallops, parsnip fritters, venison tartare, deboned quail, kohlrabi with speck, shredded lamb, green beans, and mini bison burgers. Everything was excellent - our 3-year old ate almost all the kohlrabi! Would recommend 3-4 plates per person."
/user_details?userid=hQRW9tg2Knkq5Nw6Po8mOg,Alice C.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"My husband and I came to Montreal for the weekend to meet up with my best friend and her fiancé. We stumbled on this tapas place because the other restaurants we were looking at were all booked and we had not made reservations. This place was cozy and classy. I liked the decorations a lot, lots of wine glasses in chandelier form! We had a lot of small dishes over 2-3 hours. The olives and candied lemon was interesting (and the candied lemon slivers were tiny!)... we had a candied lemon crisis while trying to split it evenly at the end because the slivers were so tiny we kept almost losing them! They weren't too different from just plain green olives, though the tiny candied lemon was an interesting twist. We had a salmon dish that was very good. They served it with cute toppings on the side that you could sprinkle on yourself, including caviar. The foie gras was okay- much better with the toppings and bread together, but my friend did not like it. We got local cheeses on a cheese board, and most of it was pretty tasty! Comes with hard and soft bread. The cheese went a surprisingly long way with the bread! The mushrooms and polenta was REALLY delicious and a great dish to end on. I was not too impressed with the orange wine or red wine, but I the xerios wine was really good. It tasted more like a sweet rum. The vermouth smelled very good, and tasted pretty good but not as good as it smelled. Overall, service was good, and we had a great time there. It definitely takes a while to get through all the dishes and for the servers to come sometimes, but decor was on point and taste was delicious for the most part.  I would come for the mushrooms and polenta again."
/user_details?userid=BlqSs9gbO7UeJ35CCn8lHA,Erik D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Perfect for my partner and I who don't get out as often! The smaller plates allow us to try a variety of different dishes. The wine choices are quite nice and unique; and our hostess was very knowledgable with her wine recommendations. Finished off the evening with some nice digestifs (whiskey and negroni) and their decadent desserts (churo and lemon semifreddo). Would go back here again!

/user_details?userid=ULORHe9WdrcZ_-X2mRvUcA,Gina C.,"Daleville, VA",5 star rating,"Cannot say anything bad about this place. I would recommend making a reservation. It is very small inside. We were seated at a very small table against the wall on the lower level. If you are ordering three small plates and wine, it will not fit on this table. We did have to move to a larger table. Absolutely everything about this place was amazing. The server, the service, the wine, the food....all great. We had the charcuterie board, the cheese board and the gnocchi. The charcuterie board was basic. There was a mousse of some sort on there that was great. The cheese board came with a sauce or spread that complimented each cheese perfectly. The gnocchi was a mushroom and pecorino gnocchi. I could have licked the bowl clean, that's how good it was. For dessert we had the coffee creme brûlée which was light, perfect temperature and was the perfect way to finish off the meal. I would highly recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=rN4RItq4xONM-cjgSfbvDQ,Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",4 star rating,"Ah, a wine bar. Plus tapas! When I see either one of these categories I get very excited, so when they're combined you know I'm happy as a clam. On my last day of vacation, while Adam was executing the ""business"" portion of our trip, I chose Pullman as our final restaurant stop together. I'm totally happy with the decision and I'd definitely return.First of all, Pullman is in a great location that was walking distance from our downtown hotel (right next to the amazing La Crepe 2 Go, which I'll review soon). The atmosphere is very chic and sexy. There's a gorgeous, sparkling, ornate chandelier right as you walk in, and there are many small tables and a little bar. We didn't go upstairs (but it looked fabulous up there like the rest of the restaurant) - we walked down a little half staircase to our own tiny table. And I mean tiny... Adam even had to share a stool with the person behind him. It was meant to be shared, of course, but it's just super close quarters. We had trouble fitting our food, plates, silverware, wine, and water on our table since it was literally like a 2X2 foot square. It was really lovely though - with only a little light from a single candle. Romantic and cozy.Our waiter did a great job talking about the wine and making recommendations. You can get little 2 oz pours of several wines for $4.5-$7 CAD each, a 4 oz glass for $8-$15ish, and a flight of three 2 oz pours for $22ish. We stuck with a regular 4 oz glass, and our favorite was a white from Slovenia. We mentioned to the waiter that we're not picky about wine as long as it isn't sweet, and he told us ""there's no sweet wine on our menu."" Well, good!For dinner we had the cheese board, the charcuterie board, and the Piri Piri short ribs. Ohhhhh man, I was in heaven. There were 4 very different and beautiful cheeses paired with 4 accompaniments (pureed fig, apple, some other kind of fruit jelly thing, and a walnut paste). The charcuterie board was AMAZING with 2 incredible sausages, prosciutto, duck, pate, a mustard cream sauce, grapes, and cornichons. The piri piri short ribs were phenomenal - the sauce was super spicy, but not overbearing. Nice portions and plenty of food to share on each plate. Plus, these tapas are definitely affordable. I'd say most items were between $8-$12. Beautiful meal and setting all around."

Either our party of four was just lucky ordering the best dozen tapas items or there isn't  a bad dish on the menu! Highlights were the buffalo tartare, polenta, crab cakes and tuna.

/user_details?userid=pZpYB0PxWnh73a96ZjDIwg,Tobi T.,"Alpine, NY",3 star rating,"The Pullman is a cozy little wine and tapas place. The decor is of rich dark wood and soft lighting. The music is a bit overwhelming for quiet conversation. The service was not precisely up to par considering this is an upscale restaurant. Our server sported a hipster look with a flower tattoo on his wrist. He was curt and acted as if we were a bother to his slow evening. It's too bad really, we were here visiting the University and simply looking forward to a pleasant dining experience. The food was fine, it is somewhat creative, and presented well, but not amazing. The presentation was easily the best part aside from the remarkable wine selection. The mini bison burgers and miniature cone of fries were adorable. Lucky for us, this place was close to the hotel on a frigid evening, however when we return, I would rather walk further to avoid being treated poorly."

The owners of the vineyards were actually in the bar, and we got to talk to them while drinking their products. Super cool! They have a great selection of appetizers and shared plates, also countless types of wines are available. I ended up finding one of my favourite red wines from this place. I think I like this place when they have their events, like the aforementioned Oregon wines, but it's a great spot to go to if you're around the area."

But it's been 6 mnths since we last ate here and clearly something (the servers??) has changed. This review is about the awful service. Food = 8/10, service = -10/10. Our waitress upstairs forgot to place our order; and only placed our friends (we were on a dble date). When our friends food kept coming and ours didn't we realized something was amiss and asked where was our food. She seemed oblivious to what we meant even though we had discussed with her our two orders. Not sure if she's just distracted, bored or what?! The floor was dead quiet so she wasn't busy...to top it off she took no accountability and though she covered our last wine she did so begrudgingly w no real apology for a major f* up since it was too late for us to order and eat and get home in time for our babysitter. It would've been a waste of a night if not for our great friendly company :) we ended up reheating pizza for dinner at 11pm once we got home. Sigh."

I would have paid a bit more to add some punch to the food. My wife and I ordered the spiced nuts and goat cheese apps which were a good start with a bottle of cotes-du-rhone wine. We then ordered the grilled cheese, bison sliders and arancini. The grilled cheese was good, but could have used a dip of some kind, a chipotle ketchup or an aioli. The bison sliders were much smaller than they seemed in the pictures on Yelp, which is not a big deal, but they were super dry and the flavor was not great. The fries that it came with were over cooked. The arancini was OK. Finished with churros for dessert. Also ok. I'd go back, but stick to drinks and possibly cheese and charcuterie plates."

In general, I don't like the super fancy vibe in Montreal restaurants, because you can get really amazing and unique food at a chiller places. So, in Montreal, fancy does not equal better food. So then why would I pay extra $$ just for some dimmer lights and a more extensive wine menu? On its own, it's a good place, but considering what MtL has to offer in just a hop, skip and jump away from this place - no thanks. Oh, and small portions! Bye!"

From the looks of it and what friends had told me was this establishment had really taken it up a notch.Needless to say, the food and wine were fantastic. The waiter, when she was available, was very helpful with the wine selections and was very friendly. My only major qualm with the place is that for a table of mid-twenty-somethings we were likely the youngest and tamest people there. It seemed that the place turns into a rowdy happy hour joint for middle aged professionals around 6. At certain points during our visit, I couldn't hear my partner across the tiny table at all over the cackling of other groups.This place would probably be a lot of fun for a large wine-lovin' group, but as an intimate date spot I would probably head elsewhere."

Overall we were not impressed. Weird first impression: it looked closed from the outside because of the extremely low lighting inside. We were met at the door by a maitre d' who informed us, oddly we thought, that we were strongly encouraged to order some food from the menu and not just drink - something about ""respecting the spirit of the law"" or some such. Huh? Anyway, since we had some time to kill before our dinner reservation, we did decide to order a small plate with our wine. I don't even recall what it was, but we were hungry and it taste good. Our server couldn't have been nicer and was genuinely well informed about wine. She made two solid recommendations based on what we each thought we were in the mood for. The red wines we ordered by the glass were adequate but hardly outstanding. But maybe this impression was made because both were served slightly chilled! We both found this odd and didn't understand why red wines weren't being served at room temperature. Overall it was an experience that left us bewildered by the glowing reviews that Pullman has received on Yelp."

Easy 5 star review.Mrs. Pinky and I arrived an hour early for our reservation, planning on having a few glasses of wine before our meal. Instead we ended up lounging at a table - they had seating available - and our waiter realized we were American. He chuckled at our broken French and spoke to us in English, quickly allowing us to become comfortable.We are fairly easy to please, and he asked Mrs. Pinky what kind of wine she liked. She replied she was open minded and liked white wines, he said, ""I'll take care of you, I'll get you a flight of things I think you'll like."" I said, ""I'll do the same... but for red wine, if I may?"" He happily obliged.The dude nailed it. He made great recommendations that paired well with our food. I had a burgundy, a pinot noir, and a syrah. Mrs. Pinky has a riesling, a sancerre, and some interesting oxidized mixed berry wine that I can't remember. Everything was fantastic. We had the duck cavatelli, charcuterie plate, venison tartare, olives with candied lemon, and finished with the cinnamon churros and chocolate dipping sauce. We were never rushed, the food was fabulous, the wine plentiful, and when we were ready to go our waiter took the time to recommend 5 or 6 different places we should go next. We took his advice and walked down to Mimi La Nuit in Old Montreal when we were finished.Fantastic place, I highly recommend going if you're thinking about it."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Location: Parc Avenue, above Sherbrooke. It's an easy walk from the downtown core (+/- 10 minutes). Parking will probably be an issue if you decide to drive.The place: It's small and the layout is awkward.  After you walk in, there's a staircase that leads upstairs almost directly ahead of you, and if you hang a quick right, there's the bar and a few seats by the window. It's all very cramped. If you squeeze past all that, there's a downstairs bit too. Decor/Ambiance: I didn't particularly care for either. Why? Because I didn't feel like there WAS a vibe. Maybe it was because I went right after work but I mean, it was a Thursday so you would think more people would be showing up between 5-7pm. They do have a kickass chandelier made from various wine glasses and champagne flutes thought. I mean, if that's your thing. The decor is ordinary and nothing to write home about.The wine: I am not a wine connoisseur by any means, but I know what I like. Pullman has a very nice variety of wines from different regions that you can purchase by the glass or by the bottle. Take note - like any other place that sells wine by the bottle, they do so at inflated prices. I ordered a glass of white that was delicious - unfortunately I have no recollection of its name. And no, it's not because I was boozin'! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions so kudos to him. The food: Over. Priced. The theme here is tapas, so you can share your dishes or keep them all to yourself. I ordered the Mozzarella di Bufala with confit tomatoes and fennel. The portion was quite large and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. I did enjoy the dish, however the Mozzarella wasn't fresh and it was a little too cold for my taste. The tomatoes added a nice flavor, the fennel was well, fennel (I love fennel!), the vinaigrette  was a little too vinegary and the sliced capers seemed out of place in this dish. My friend had the quail, as well as the shrimp and Chorizo. I tasted this last dish and wasn't impressed. There was a weird flavor to it and the Chorizo was pretty darn firm and lukewarm. I then tried the goat cheese cheesecake with maple meringue, which was quite nice but the meringue was a bit dry and therefore crumbled very easily. You either had to take very slow and deliberate bites or shove the whole thing in your mouth, which just isn't ladylike. The maple meringue wasn't overly sweet but it seemed chilled. I would have liked it to be at room temperature.Service: Meh. Despite 3-4 waiters hovering around the bar, it took forever to get service. One of the waiters kept walking by our table, looking me in the eye each time, but not once did he stop to ask if we needed/wanted anything. We had to get up and go get our bill as well. The price: Inflated. For one glass of wine, the Mozzarella and the dessert, it cost me $40. No thanks. I can get better tapas and equally good wine at a place like Dolcetto and not break the bank.   If I could just go to Pullman for the wine, I might go back, but I think you have to eat to drink - or at least, you used to."

And this foie gras was a world apart. Transcendent. The last time I had it this good was at my 23 birthday at Georges in Paris. Take that how you will. They brought it out first. Because they knew.The foie gras terrine had a layer of cherry to it and was split in two rectangular cubes on either side of the plate and both the foie gras and the bunch of perfect brioche triangles rested on a bed of apricot confit. The apricot was not sweet; it took me a moment to place it and I would not call it jam, more finely diced dried abricots. Creamy, rich and just right with the cherry & apricot elements, this should not be missed.The mini bison burgers were tiny, juicy bites of perfection and the fries were a tiny cone of crispy, buttery goodness. The house sauce and pickle added tang to the burgers, sandwiched in their poppy seeded brioche mini buns.Light and fresh, the ricotta gnocchi with tomatoes/basilic were tiny soft pillows, with an aromatically fresh sauce. Delightful and refreshing, if outshone by the other things we had.Flight of Bordeaux, was presented with the bottles behind them, but before I had a chance to note them, they were whisked away. At least two of them were really good and gave a chance to sample more than I would have had as a full glass.The Assiette de mignardises was an adorable display of tiny cookies/treats, from macarons to jammy squares to madeleines.

It sounds like a strange mixture of flavours but I thought it was a perfect combination of spicy, salty, sweet and savoury.The porto grilled cheese had an interesting jammy flavour.The matchstick fries that came with the mini bison burgers were like hickory sticks but better and just as addictive.

And they always get laid.Kidding! I actually haven't been able to keep track of how successful they've been. That's how often I recommend Pullman!I think every server must be a sommelier because they are so knowledgeable about the wine, and they never try to trick you into getting something just because it's more expensive. In fact, they make you feel like it's really normal to be mildly concerned about the price by casually asking you for a range when suggesting a bottle.The food is great, and I don't know why I love ticking my order off a paper menu with a pencil so much, but maybe it's because it feels like a little personality quiz. It's interactive, and with one menu and one pencil, you know you're sharing the food with your date. They always have oysters and there is a flight of sparkling wines on the menu, so aphrodisiac central for those of you looking to seal the deal. Maybe it's more of a third date place. I don't know.

We ordered a pastry item that had cheese and bacon stuffing and that was just very dry. Perhaps with some sort of dipping sauce, it would be better. The best dish was a spinach pasta with clams and lobster bisque. The pasta was tasty and cooked to just the right temperature and was al dente. The clam was overcooked and chewy.

They love to have aperitif so I suggested we go to Pullman for some wine and snacks before dinner. Since they love wine and are pretty knowledgeable about it this place was great. They got to try some nice wines and we had some delicious cheese and charcuterie. It was the perfect pre-dinner place. It was even mentioned that this was their favorite bar on the whole trip.Nice decor and good service. It was a pretty elegant place with a relaxed environment. Would be a nice date-place or girls night.A bit pricey so I would suggest going here expecting to pay a lot
/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Pullman's is a trendy and upscale wine bar, serving small tapas-style dishes that are great for pairing with your wine of choice.Tapas worth ordering: Fromages du Quebec, Charcuteries, Fried Cod with Spicy Mayo, Sesame Scallops, Port-Steeped Cheddar Grilled Cheese, and Mini Bison Burgers with Matchstick Fries.They have an extravagant list of wines, which is great because I absolutely love wine and am always curious about trying something new. For those interested in trying various types at once, they offer ""trio's"" based on wines by the same makers, regions, or of similar flavours, and this changes regularly.A great wine worth ordering is the Cote de Brouilly 2009, from Chateau Thivin. It is a Beaujolais from Burgundy that is smokey, dark, well balanced, and full of great flavour.The jazzy music and elegantly busy atmosphere makes for a great night, guaranteed. The bar is spacious and spread over 3 floors, while remaining cozy and charming. The beautiful chandelier built from wine glasses are worth mentioning, and hangs over the main floor. You would never guess that this gem was hiding within an odd-looking building, let alone right across the street from Provigo, but it is and I do not think it will be going anywhere anytime soon.If you are ready to spend some money, then this is a great place to go. Whether it be on a date, a girls night out, or for a little group gathering, it is the perfect place. In all my experiences at Pullman, the service has been satisfying. On a few, very rare, occasions the service may have been slow, but never disappointing. You want to come here to sit back, relax, and take your time enjoying the wine, food, and ambiance. Do not rush it."

The waiter, Dabril, was very knowledgeable about every wine that was offered and was quick with recommendations. He was also very personable and remembered us when we returned a couple days later. The tapas were the perfect size to try different foods without getting filled up too quickly. Between the two nights we probably tried 1/3 of the food offered and it all tasted pretty good. The atmosphere was lively without being uncomfortably loud. There are four areas that you can sit in that allow you to sit at a small dining table, a secluded bar in the front, couches in the front, or a larger bar in the back."

It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while."

Initial search results were some of the more popular spots that had mixed reviews.  I find that going to the area and searching nearby has been more helpful.I came across Pullman and was pleasantly surprised. This bi-level restaurant with warm, but modern decor, serving a tapas menu was a great find. I was solo, so sat at the bar and Veronique took excellent care of me. From helping me choose some of their popular dishes, to pairing with wine, I had a great experience. The fluke tartare and the crispy lamb were standouts.If you are seeing a show in the area, get away from the crowded touristy spots around the venue and stop here instead."

However, the food was mediocre and I wasn't really ""wow'ed"" I felt like the menu didn't have much vareity and I was surprised there was no fish or chicken options.

/user_details?userid=1hJQYk3NiajdYK58TQi9EQ,Anita H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's difficult to give an accurate overall score because it's quite non cohesive in terms of decor, the style of food, and the service. If you're sitting at the front or on the first landing, it's about the best spots you can get. The back section of the restaurant looks like it's perpetually in need of renovation and looks like it wasn't meant to be opened to clients. The view isn't all that great either as the glaring bright Provigo grocery store sign is front and center across the restaurant. Decor gets a low 3* score from me.  The food was unique and it's supposed to be tapas styled and of a Canadian fusion influence.  There's enough variety in tapas choices from small bites to more savoury dishes. The food is nicely presented and the taste is intricate and thoughtfully put together for the most part. I would compliment them on the food presentation as it makes up for less cohesive restaurant decor. I would put that at 5*. The salmon gravlax didn't make too much sense to me in terms of how to eat it but it wasn't bad. As for the wait staff, I'm not sure if the lengthy delay between the dishes was intentional but it was a considerable wait after the first 2 dishes. One of the wait staff must've been impatient to get out of the resto so her service was very average but the other one serving us was nice and friendly. Service would get a 4*.  Crowd is mainly of a younger age group but a couple brought their child to eat there, which I would say it's not really a kid friendly resto. It's a pretty decent place (only at the front) for a date and as every dish is supposedly shareable it does require some negotiation for who gets what. 3 people eating makes it very tricky to split evenly so best to show up in pairs or someone will be short changed for their meal. Most recommend 3-4 dishes per person to be considered filling. Overall, I would say it's a unique experience, more on the pricey side especially if you throw in the wine.  It gets a 4/5 from me."

I couldn't even move. It also took a very long for our server to greet us. We ordered grilled cheese... They were ok. Nothing special. We ordered the crispy lamb with onion purée. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. It almost tasted wrong if that makes sense. We also got the cheese plate. I thought that was good.Wine list was also good.

Waitress was very knowledgable about wines but it was hard to hear her when she spoke and a lot of information to take in at once, would have been nice to see description in writing. Ordered 5 plates to share between two plus dessert and it was the perfect amount of food. Each plate was unique and delicious and paired nicely with the wine tasting. The interior of the Pullman was modern, classic and creative, loved the wine glass chandelier.

Space is a bit concerning, but if you don't mind spartan seating in a dim-lit corner, then it poses no issues. It is the space issue that proved rather burdensome (having to get up a few times to accommodate servers passing through can be a bit undesirable - but it was busy, and the staff did ultimately accommodate us).

From the first moment I stepped in the ambiance of the walls and the magnificent chandelier mesmerized me. For finger food I recommend their mini burgers. For wine, I have never been disappointed by their mini samplers. Great place!

It's just the perfect meet and greet spot. If you have ever experienced online dating, then you know meeting at the perfect spot is what sets the mood. Pullman has this relaxed atmosphere of people who want to drink and socialize, the appetizers are just breaks in those intimate moments of deep conversations. They say oysters and red wine are aphrodisiacs, luckily Pullman's has the best of both and a staff that is very knowledgeable about their alcohol (rare in most bars and lounges today). My only complaint is that three appetizers that my group ordered was never delivered, but who is counting when there is an abundance of champagne. You will enjoy yourself if you are in good company and forget how short the weekend is."

The atmosphere is really fun and trendy. We had dinner on the second level where there are a lot of high-tops and a small bar (where we ate). The music could have been special for the holiday, but I hope not! Loved it. The restaurant was playing jazzy romantic music and really set the mood for a good date spot.Food and wine were really great. We shared 6 plates which worked out to be a perfect amount as some of the plates are very small (scallops, you get one each). Would highly recommend the sea bass carpaccio and venison tartare.Staff we met were very friendly and helpful, restaurant was lively and fun.... overall really great experience.

They have nothing like that on the menu, and when the server offered to make up a flight with my taste in mind, it failed miserably. When I expressed my dislike of 2 of them, the server was condescending in his comment about trying to 'educate' me.  I don't care to pay to be talked down to -- no matter my tastes."

It was very dark in the front where we sat and we both had trouble seeing our food well. Right above us was a pretty cool chandelier with hanging wine glasses, I noticed they were all clear glass except one black one.We got the croquettes, mini bison burgers, smoked salmon and cheesecake. The croquettes were nice and crunchy on the outside and very smooth and creamy on the inside. The mini bison burgers were very tasted but came with way too many ""fries"" which reminded me of some thin crispy things that came in a can that I used to eat as a kid. If they used half as many they would have gotten the same effect but they were too salty to eat all of them.We also got a couple of Manhattan's that were well mixed but decided to move on to a different place for our next drink. The waitress and waiter were both very nice and good service is definitely a plus. The whole experience was pretty expensive and although the quality at Pullman's is good, I've had better for less cost."

The Goat cheese with herbs & spicy red peppers was really good and came with some toast.  Green beans, truffle oil & roasted almonds was different and very tasty.  The Fried cod balls were good but not the best.  The Mixed fried mushrooms, crostini & watercress was really tasty.  We also had the sliced Duck, which was amazing and melted in your mouth.Good spot for some wine and a light intimate dinner.  Check out the very cool chandler."

With that said, the food was delicious and we enjoyed everything that we ordered.  Our favorites were the beets and the bison sliders.  In fact, the bison slider might be the best bison slider (or burger for that matter) that I've ever had.  Delicious mini pickle, aioli, and the meat was juicy, not dry.  Wish I could go back and try more!PS.  The dessert plate of four is not a sampling of other things on the dessert menu, but still delicious."

The wait staff was very helpful in pairing our food choices with wine as neither of us are necessarily wine connaisseurs and both very open to suggestions.All in all, Pullman was a nice restaurant with some very decent food.

When we ask for the bill is not the time to inform us that we are required to order food. Before we are seated would have been a better time. Unimpressed. Still, a good place to go on a date, as I saw lots of couples around. The waitress who seated us was not very friendly, however our server was very nice, and knowledgeable.$90 with tax and tip for a bottle of wine."

Good thing we got there as soon as it opened, because reservations are clearly a must for this popular spot. As soon as you enter, it is hard not to notice the huge chandelier made out of glasses!! Such a beautiful focal point.The staff were nice and approachable. We were seated right away and given the wine menu as well as the food menu where you can check off what you would like to eat. I thought that was a great system. I decided to go with a glass of reisling and my boyfriend got the selection of three wines. As per our food selection, we went with the following: marinated olives with candied lemon, fried calamari, charcuterie plate, mini bison burgers, marinated tuna and the quebec cheese platter. I found that that was a good enough quantity for two people. Everything was absolutely delicious. The fried calamari was very light, came with a green sauce that complimented it well. The marinated tuna was paired with apples which was very pleasing to the palette. The charcuterie plate was abundant and the blue cheese from the quebec cheese platter was a highlight. What a nice meal before a five hour trip home!"
/user_details?userid=HQv3cpiQz4vd7LWyn7JH1Q,Lesley T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pullman is a haven for wine lovers, whether just learning about wine or connoisseur. They have a great selection of carefully-chosen bottles and also offer a nice variety of wines by the glass. You can also try a flight of wine that allows you to compare and contrast small glasses (2 oz) of three wines according to a certain theme. The tapas make a tasty snack to go with your wine (they're better for snacking than for a full meal). The atmosphere is trendy yet comfortable, and the chandelier made out of wine glasses is a beautiful centerpiece to the space. It's a good place for a date.I was there recently and tried a flight of Cabernet Franc, all from different parts of the Loire. Those were some interesting reds. For dessert, we tried something rare and unusual: Macvin du Jura. Wines from the French wine region Jura are unusual enough anyway, but this one was pretty special - a late harvest wine that's been fortified. I was excited about the chance to try it. We also tried the cheese plate, which was well presented with each cheese served with some kind of fruit spread or nut that matched the cheese well. The olives were huge and took some work to get through. Next time, I would skip the curry hummus with vegetables. I guess I was looking for a heartier, more traditional hummus. My partner enjoyed the bison burgers. But go for the wine, not the food, and take the chance to try something different!"

Like all good wine bars you can select your trio or set in your custom order, or you can be like me: rely on the expertise of people who are passionate about their work and wine.Not only is the wine choice exceptional, the food choice, though limited, rivals some of the best fine restaurants in major U.S. cities. I'm a big fan of burgers and a bigger fan of mini-burgers called ""sliders"".  Pullman creates something smaller, but packs more flavor than a slider. Make no mistake, despite its size, this nano burger is a perfect size appetizer than is a perfect food pair to your wine flight.So if you are curious about this great wine bar and live close to Montreal, Quebec (like you New Yorkers), don't make excuses and schedule a visit to Pullman."

This was my first visit to Montreal and the bar was listed in my guidebook. I love that it's an 'adult' wine bar. I'm not a big beer drinker and those kind of places seemed to proliferate Montreal. The crowd seemed to lean more English speakers when I was there. The bartenders are perfectly bilingual. But, there was a discrepancy with my drink. I asked if it was a an apple cider. The bartender said yes. It was clear when it was delivered that it was an ice wine. Much sweeter than I wanted. I asked to see a new menu and didn't touch my drink. There was no offer or check in on the ice wine. Yes, I could have asked on my own for something else. But, it would have been nice to be asked.The appetizers were absolutely delish.

The waiter made a suggestion to pair our dishes with a nice bottle of white wine and some local Montreal beer. They only served bottled beer, nothing on draft/tap.

When the waitress arrived she told us they don't usually have a candle on that table but she'd let us keep it.

These were a nice showing of Pinot from different European areas and all were very nice in some way.

/user_details?userid=lRDDSgjtfnJOUKLNKF-mHQ,Jessica D.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Currently sitting in this restaurant. When the three of us first arrived, the waitress/bartender took our coats to the coat check which was nice. We were seated quickly and given menus. The waitress then came back 3 times within 15 minutes of us being seated. We ordered on her third trip and received our drinks and the charcuterie board (one of the only redeeming factors of this place) and then were ignored for the next 45 minutes despite our drinks being empty and us finishing up the charcuterie board. The waitress helped the other two tables directly next to us 3 times without even making eye contact with us. Without sounding too ignorant, I do believe it was because we were English speakers and unfortunately they gave off the vibe that feeds into the Montreal stereotype of not liking natives. When we finally were approached by the waitress again, we just wanted some water and to order more drinks and food. They brought us back water with ice despite no one else receiving water with ice. After spending some time in France, and seeing how the Parisians stuck their noses up at Americans, I unfortunately took this as an insult. We didn't come to Montreal to have an American vacation. It's unfortunate they treat those who are fully open to being immersed to French-Canadian culture as second class. Will not come back when there are so many other options available in this city."

The place is interesting and the menu has some landscape worth exploring. The trio of Pinot Noir 2 oz selections - Oregon, France and Australia - was fun. Serving in Reidel glass is a serious plus. Stay tuned for updates as they happen..."

/user_details?userid=AhUaj0youDpN-0MTttRg2g,A. D.,"Metuchen, NJ",4 star rating,"Came here with my girlfriends for drinks on a rainy Saturday night, circa, 11pm. We were asked if we had reservations....at 11pm? Seriously!? The hostess took us upstairs in a cramped space, where we shared a seating bench with a couple sitting next to us, and our friend sat across from us in a chair...our table was narrow, and frankly, the whole set up wasn't very comfortable. The waitress came by to take our order and she was delightful. We ordered a cheese plate, and olives to accompany our drinks. I ordered a Negroni, while my friends ordered a glass of Chianti each. The ""chef"" came out with our dish and to explain exactly what we were getting, and he did so graciously. The cheese plate in question also had a variety of spreads to balance out the taste of each cheese---the spreads were coing, walnut, and fig. Everything was good and the service, was impeccable. Besides the seating arrangements, the overall experience was pleasant. A definite do for a quick drink and bite!"

However, the atmosphere was very uncomfortable, maybe too trendy for our 50-something age.  Music too loud and when we complained we were graciously moved downstairs where the music was no quieter.  Strangely the hostess suggested we might have to move to a 3rd table when another party arrived (though the restaurant was not crowded) - we declined! Tables were uncomfortable with odd angles and no way for our party of 3 to sit comfortably."
