/user_details?userid=bI5b9gC4HJ_qAefoG850bw,Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"Bar and Restaurant located inside of Renaissance  downtown Montreal. Asian, non-fushion style restaurant. Bartenders Sam and Maria are awesome. Sam is definitely a true mixologist and someone to watch out for. The food is very good but if Asian is not your thing, tou should not eat here. Great service, drinks, and food. Fun and lively atmosphere. I recommend visiting if you are in the area. Bon Apetit."

/user_details?userid=SuqJwq0qpFQSM6NcqkSERQ,Yonelle G.,"Macon, GA",4 star rating,"Bf and I were craving some asian food. We decided to try this place out. I was impressed by the venue. I really liked how the place was decorated. The art piece on the wall was neat. I like the color scheme and the layout. The prices were a bit high to me but not too too bad. To start off, we had the Tai Chi Gow Dumplings. They were yummy! I was sad that we had only ordered one serving, because I wanted more haha. For the main dish I had the Peking Duck. I wanted to try something totally different than what I normally get. And I was so satisfied with this dish. I would definitely come back to get it again if I could. My bf had the Pad Thai with chicken. I was glad that I did not get that because it was rather disappointing. He thought it was ok. But my food was delicious!I would recommend this place for the duck and dumplings for sure hehe."
/user_details?userid=emClTWXE_ou1_RJ5PHIAUQ,Iris N.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,I didn't expect too much because it's not an authentic Asian restaurant. The maki roll is not bad but not enough sushi rice and too much cucumber. The steam dumplings wrap is too thick. The baos in the same steam basket are not at a consistent qualify. Some baos are harder than others. It's like the baos have been out for awhile or they are not steamed enough. Definitely over priced for the food but quality of service is good and nice ambiance.
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"After avoiding coming to East for about a year because of mixed reviews online, I finally gave in and stopped by a couple weeks ago for dinner with hubby. We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday night and were met with a buzzing atmosphere around the bar area. We were quickly taken to the dining section in the back and were seated in a half booth (non-booth chair was weirdly designed and super uncomfy if you slid the whole way back...minus half a star). Upon a quick glance at the menu, I was surprised at some of the ridiculous prices ($14 for one small bao, $30 for a bulgogi, etc). After trying to order 3 dishes and being told that they were sold out of them all, I went for the overpriced bibimbap and hubby for the overpriced lamb curry as well as the 'amazing' extremely overpriced dumpling platter to share (see a trend here?). When the dumplings came out, I was immediately unimpressed. Having been told that these were super phenomenally amazing (major upsell), I couldn't see or really taste anything phenomenal to be honest. When you pay almost $3 PER DUMPLING ($33 for 12), you really expect the sun and moon to explode into your mouth but nothing other than a monotonous flavor was present (you could barely differentiate the four different flavors presented either). Other than this dish, the two main dishes were ok but nothing special at all. We ended up paying $167 with tax and tip for these three dishes and two drinks - one of the most painful payments I've ever made (I'm all for spending a lot on great food but this all fell super short and felt like a major rip off). Will definitely not be back...."
/user_details?userid=R9YKpPY0Q4LMxF_muYjY1g,Uyen V.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"The prices are a bit ridiculous, considering the type of food, but I guess you're paying for the ambience and location.  It's a good spot if you're on a date or looking to have a nice meal, but I had a 4 year old and there weren't any options for kids, just $11 for 4 pieces of Hai gow."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Recently discovered this trendy new Asian resto in the heart of downtown montreal and truly loved it! One can't help being awed by it's beautiful eye catching interior decor as soon as you step into the resto. The service is warm and friendly. The dishes are amazing and beautifully plated...simply works of art. Would definately recommend for groups, special occasions or 5 a 7's. My favorite dish was the chicken pad thai and black cod. Will definitely return to this resto!"
/user_details?userid=zsGH_1XyUxuP5O34WL6eLg,Jua P.,"Danville, CA",5 star rating,"Spent a couple of evenings on our trip at this bar and restaurant on the ground floor of the Renaissance. They have a menu that covers several different types of Asian cuisine (Korean, Thai, Chinese, etc...), which is such a nice treat for someone who loves variety! Every dish we tried was delicious and they have a great happy hour of cocktails and appetizers to boot!"
/user_details?userid=j5i1zkE75qwpwrKy-puFBg,Fawzi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,I have been here several times and it would seem the quality just keep on getting worse every time. Today the dish was so horrible that I had to ask if they have a new chef. Some of the vegetables were black and rotten and the overall quality of all the ingredient was so poor that after few bites I hope I will not get sick and this will be the last time I stop here. Shame this used to be one of my favorite places as I always stay at this Renaissance...ah well as the Qs would say C'est la vie..
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So where to begin...My husband recently brought me to East for our date night and to my high expectations, it suited perfectly :)Situated in the famous downtown Renaissance hotel, this pan-asian restaurant contrasts yet also compliments the hotel. Our immediate reaction to entering through the separate entrance for the restaurant was the super swanky interior - dark with dimmed lighting, very contemporary with east asian influences. The vibrant red and black décor creates an ambiance which works well for most settings - from the buzzing office party that was happening at the bar area to the more intimate separated dining area where we were seated. The interior is so intricate, you could spend ages staring at it! Prepare to be mesmerized by the gorgeous hand-painted wall of an asian beauty..Now on to the meal...We were given a lot of attention and taken very well care of by the staff which even before eating, made us feel comfortable and love the place. Our waiter spent time describing the dishes to us, which ingredients were used, which spices... It was evident to see that this place takes pride in their fresh ingredients and has expert chefs!We ordered the papaya salad for starters and boy, was it good!! I never expected a salad starter to be this delicious but this really was something else. It is quite spicy but that is what makes it so special.. The contrast between the sweetness from the papaya and the spices create the most delicious combination.For the main course, we had the Singapore noodles and the sea bass. Both were just as good as they looked (they were excellently presented!) and the spices were to my palate. Since a recent trip to Malaysia, I became accustomed to spicy noodles and have been unable to find them... However, this place did them just right and I am so so SO happy to have discovered it! At least I know where to go next to satisfy my cravings and to take me back down memory lane :):) My husband loved the sea bass which was gorgeously garnished and also had a kick to it! We did not want to leave the place as we felt so spoilt so we decided to have dessert too! It took time to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait! We were presented with a stunning tray of a type of coconut tart and a hot chocolate soufflé! For a chocolate lover, the soufflé just melted my heart, it was mouth-watering just to look at and tasted even better!! We enjoyed these treats with tea which again was presented extremely well...Overall, if you want to spoil yourself with some exotic tastes and want to enjoy a relaxing ambiance, this is definitely the place for you! The food is of an extremely high quality with carefully selected ingredients and prepared with pride :)I cannot wait for my next visit to East Restaurant!! Thank you for making our experience an unforgettable one :):):)"
/user_details?userid=5qIwy91T9rAQj3_2O4cn5g,Leo M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Shockingly, surprisingly, delicious Asian cuisine in an exceptional restaurant.Easily my best meal in Montreal, East offers a phenomenal dining/drinking experience. The atmosphere is fun and fabulous, the service was exemplary, the drinks were perfection, and I was truly shocked and surprised at how delicious the food was in this non-traditional Asian restaurant. I started with the Peking Duck Bao - two large bao crunchy and umami and well spiced. Then moved on to the Spicy Tartar Maki - enormous and delicious with lots of fresh fish flavor. My only complaint is that the maki were too large leaving you the choice of biting through nori or overstuffing your face. The drinks were in fact beyond perfection. The Green Lantern was an herbaceous sake delight and the East a vibrant balance of flavor and texture (I ordered mine light on the syrup to contain the sweetness - your mileage may vary). The bartender was a delight - not only providing prompt, friendly, efficient service but also discussing the options and techniques available to a good mixologist. And the atmosphere was both welcoming and entertaining - if I didn't have other places to be I could have hung out here all evening.It isn't often I get to sing a song of unrelenting praise. Dining at East offered me such an opportunity."
/user_details?userid=NXGHE6Cbjpk5S6LNATdYzg,Cindy K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Food is delicious and the portions are generous. I wouldn't order the dim sum here as you can get fairly similar quality in Chinatown at a fraction of the cost. HOWEVER the drinks and the other items on the menu are to die for. Like the yushen salad / the tuna sushi and the baos !
/user_details?userid=4OtaY33ea-IY2V_7JjBqNQ,Derek W.,"Ashburn, VA",1 star rating,"Terrible is the perfect word to sum up my experience at East. It took me a minute to figure out how so many 5 star reviews were postwar about this palace, and the it hit me; the employees of the restaurant/hotel all store 5 star reviews. First, the shrimp on my rice dishes was so over cooked that I couldn't get it out of its shell. Next, the rice was overlooked to to the point at it was chewy and barely suitable. The next morning was met with under cooked sausage and burnt pancakes. There are so many better places to eat within walking distance than this place. Save yourself the $100+ and eat elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=3D4tuMBuhfY-HR3cYntbjQ,Steve G.,"Albany, NY",3 star rating,Very nice restaurant.  Great presentation.  A bit overpriced.  My Pad Thai was sort of a clump of noodles.  Not much flavor.  Everyone else liked their dishes but not amazing.The waitstaff was awesome.  Very attentive and responsive.
/user_details?userid=wipLfdbfvPIGZ3N94Bpqzg,Elena M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very good food but a bit pricey for lunch. I paid 40$ with tax and tip for a table d'hote ( pad thai + soupe) and a beer.  The decor is very classy and chic
/user_details?userid=4HQG1t2NQQeuSw7s-su6-w,Colditz K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1 star rating,"I got sick after eating here. While ordering the peking duck, the duck was well overcooked. The skin also wasn't rendered to anything resembling ""peking"" style. The only thing that made it justified was that they brought out some crepe wraps (which were completely stuck together) so that the overcooked duck could be wrapped in it.Additionally there was a bartender that kept making us poor tasting drinks. The quality control needed to be a bit better"
/user_details?userid=2vKPIXEFrtqZc8zIWvA4tw,MaryJane R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I loved both the atmosphere and food at this place. It's pretty trendy, especially for Montreal, but I like the change of scenery. I especially like the live DJ located in the upstairs lobby area. The food was fresh! We had the salad for two (forget the exact name) and a seafood dish. The salad was better than the entree. Also, my cocktail was pretty good. Glad to have this option in downtown. Great place to bring business guests or come with friends!4 stars because service was a bit slow. Not sure I would come here for lunch :/"

/user_details?userid=kSn1iHc15wBMh6UgeEedfA,John F.,"Chesterfield, NJ",4 star rating,"I can't say how much I love this restaurant.   The first three trips to Montreal I passed this restaurant connected to the Marriott Renaissance downtown Montreal each time to explore many of the great places to eat.  Than this one time as I headed out it started raining and decided to eat in.   Thank God I did! It, now it's  the first place I Eat on all Montreal trips.  The food is  amazing.  All of it!   So flavorful and  delicious.  The happy hour parties on W-Fri are great.  Happy people, happy staff and it's rocking with an awesome crowd. The Manager is great, the staff and bartenders are gorgeous and the dudes arnt so bad either if that's  your thing!   Decided to hit happy hour my last day on a 4 night trip.   Thinking I would have a drink and head out on the town. That Didn't happen.  The manager Guluilami (sp) had staff giving out free samples of food and apps.  He's always on top of what's happening at this place as I sit at the bar.  All of it so good.  Keeping everyone drinking and happy!  Than he had one of the beautiful  bartenders make a giant bowel of a white Sangria , of course samples to all who wanted one.  Not a white Sangria guy but this was awesome.  Had to get the recipe.  The happy hour crowd dwindles down around 7-7:30 and becomes a nice quiet romantic sheik restaurant! If you want great food , hip atmosphere great service don't pass this place up.  Especially if your staying at the Marriott."
/user_details?userid=4BGxYHoe0fC5QMQoG3Vilg,Diane Kholos W.,"Sun City, AZ",1 star rating,We were hungry on our way back to the hotel. It is my first day in Montreal so I'm not used to the conversion rates. Ordered a chicken and a shrimp pad Thai. Both candidates to $60 Canadian dollars.  That's $51 us. For three shrimp and so so pad Thai. Very disappointed. Buyer beware. In comparison the all you can eat sushi on the next block is $27 Canadian.

Drinks were extremely well made and dumplings and Peking duck were sooo good! Would definitely come back and recommend all to try. On top of that atmosphere is hip and upscale
/user_details?userid=h1KzT38UnfzR7maSi7oVUw,Andrew W.,"Portland, OR",2 star rating,I'm blown away this place has so many 5-star reviews. We waited an extraordinary amount of time despite being one of three tables sat in the restaurant. Additionally this was one of the most expensive meals we've had in our entire lives that didn't involve wine. Sushi at the $20 all you can eat joints is as good if not better.
/user_details?userid=TDGx8YhxmF3OP0XH3dYsXw,Seamus D.,"Lambertville, NJ",5 star rating,"Excellent cocktails and authentic south East Asian cuisine. I had the Singapore Street Noodles which were fantastic. In addition, I had the green lantern and White Samurai (? Can't remember the exact name) cocktails which were prepared right in front of me with fresh ingredients.The ambiance is fantastic and the restaurant is extremely convenient if you're staying at the Renaissance. Tiffany was an attentive and pleasant bartender/mixologist that provided great service."

The dining atmosphere was a little upbeat lounge almost ""clubby"" feeling but not obnoxious if that makes sense. I had a green curry and the papaya salad. Yum! The papaya salad was more thai style so not a punch in the face spice but more manageable and tastey. All in all, I would return for the delicious curry and salad."

The staff were amazing to the point where I splashed some sauce on my shirt and one of the waiters, unprompted, brought me salt and seltzer water. Amazing. The food was stunningly presented but, more importantly, was incredibly flavorful and tasty. Price wise, we thought everything was pretty much spot-on. Overall, this was a great night out, with great staff, awesome food, and very attractive space. Would definitely recommend this place."
