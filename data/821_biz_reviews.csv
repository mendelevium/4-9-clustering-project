/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Mandy's is one of my favourite places to get delivery from. Healthy, fresh, tasty! My favourite salads are the Wolfe (+ goat cheese, + egg, + red oignons) and the Cobb (+ goat cheese, - bacon, + quinoa). I usually swap the vinaigrettes for the balsamic one, as it if my favourite. They never got my custom additions/ removals/ vinaigrette swaps wrong, so I'm a big fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"

When I got to this location I advised the cashier. She apologized I told her it's okay I know the situation we are in I'm just advising you so you guys can update the hours. She was so nice and friendly in 2 minutes my salad was ready she came around to give me my salad with a free cookie, I wasn't expecting but that showed me how much they care about their customers.THANK YOU"

You can order everything ahead on their website and then they will tell you when to pick it up. My salad was fresh and tasted great, although it was a bit pricey. The service was fast and the staff was friendly even during these times. Would definitely order again."
/user_details?userid=DsRVytxsQl0bj1il7WsgAg,Michelle C.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A small cafe like restaurant with shared tables. Super cozy and has a warm decor. It's definitely a place to go to when you're in Montreal (especially if you're craving a salad). There were many classic and signature salads to choose from and all of them are amazing. I got the Cobb Salad and it was super fresh and flavourful. The portion was large as well and filling. The salad is on the pricey side but worth it to try. Next time I go, I want to try the Asian Salad!"
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent place, good vegan options. I usually take the hippie bowl, I love the texture of their tofu. The lentil peanut soup is amazing as well."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Beautiful, summer looking restaurant! White walls! Plants and flowers all around. Mandy's is known for their salad. My sister and I went there for lunch. There are two line ups. 1) order your dish, pay and take your number to your table, food will arrive when ready; 2) you can order by telephone, and pick and pay at this line. We got the The Santorini Salad and the ""Fave"" Salad. Both were absolutely delicious! The service is good. The place is beautiful.The food is super succulent.Price is super high; and it's painful.Still highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=rsnoCyL7IrF_mVC4xAqfWw,Nicky D.,"Maple, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"If you love salads then definitely have to check this place out. This place has a bunch of cool gourmet salad options. I tried one of the signature salads. You have the option to create your own. I ordered the mexi salad. It had romaine lecture, avocado, cilantro , black beans , cheddar cheese and tortilla chips in it. The chips gave the salad a nice crunchy taste. The salad was really flavourful. The portion was big. I'm not a big salad person but I really enjoyed this one. The inside of the restaurant is pretty small but very cute. Loved the dishes the salads were served in. Each table had a few sauces that you could add to your salads if you wanna wanted to make it spicy. Would definitely try this place again next time I go to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Some people think it's ridiculous to pay $17 for a salad but they say that because they've never tried Mandy's! It's surprisingly an extremely filling (and, of course, healthy) meal. Usually I can't finish the entire salad and will have to take it home for eating later (it gets a little soggy, but still delicious). There are so many great options here and you can even customize your own salad. I myself always order a pre-made salad. My favourite dressing is the tamari dressing. I usually get the Tokyo bowl or whatever the monthly bowl is when I want to try something new. You can also order salads/bowls with different dressings, so I also like having the hippie bowl with tamari dressing. Service at this location is very friendly. I will be back again!"

Overload of freshness, don't even care to do my own salads anymore, they just make it better. Healthy fast food, so blessed to finally have them close to home.  They always manage to have those little ingredients that totally makes it pop. Love the reusable containers, even get a 1$ rebate each time you use them. My favourites: The Farro and the Habibi salads as well as the Bubble Soup miam"

The salad was simple, fresh and it was a healthy alternative. It's great if you are vegan, on a diet or eat healthy. The price is very good considering the huge portion that we get. I wouldn't eat this for dinner, but it's a perfect size for a lunch.My sister ordered Asian salad and I took the Tokyo salad. Both were vegetarian and it were tasty, fresh and delicious. I would go back again."

I got the ""belle salad"" and it came with greens, pear, avocado and carrots with added chicken. It was deliciously tasty with the asian sesame sauce served on the side and perfect after a vacation already filled with decadent meals.Overall, from a range of well crafted and theme inspired salads to customizing from the very start, a perfect place to get a light but hearty meal that satisfies any type of salad craving."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I'm gonna start off by saying that I love Mandy's. I usually order from the one on Sherbrooke street west since it's close to my home and I sometimes go to the one in Phillip's square. This location however is just TERRIBLE! I've never had such bad service! I went for a TED talk at Concordia and we were not allowed to eat in the auditorium. We were given 45 min to eat lunch. So I walked on over to Mandy's which was close by and ordered my favorite salad which is the Wolfe with tofu and replaced the quinoa with lentils. I waited over 20 min for my salad and I could see that everyone who came after me got their orders. So I enquired and they said it was coming so I kept waiting. They didn't tell me anything else but clearly there was a mixup. It seems they gave my salad to someone else who didn't want it so the person sent it back. Meanwhile they had to remake my order. Finally they give me a salad and the waitress said she slipped in a chocolate chip cookie to apologize for the mixup. I walked over to Concordia now having only 15 min to eat when I realize that they made the Wolfe salad the way they normally make it which means with quinoa! Because I'm allergic to quinoa I couldn't eat the salad! I called the restaurant and they said they would give me a credit and took down my phone number. I ended up giving my salad away to a volunteer working at the Ted talk since I couldn't eat it and didn't want a salad to go to waste. I couldn't go back to Mandy's right away because I was pressed for time so I wasn't able to eat lunch. I was hangry! Luckily, I brought snacks with me and bought mid-day squares from Mandy's. Mid-day squares are really good by the way. It's healthy and actually tastes good! I also ate the cookie which was good but a bit too sweet for my liking. Anyways after the Ted talk I ordered my salad and told them about the credit and the girl at the cash had the nerve to tell me that I should have told them that I was allergic for next time! Does that mean they would be more careful if I had told them I was allergic?? First of all it doesn't matter if I'm allergic or not. I wanted lentils and they messed up my order! And instead of just apologizing for it they made me feel like it was my fault! I'm never going back there."
/user_details?userid=qZn4-4_ApTfiJHRTSwJAlQ,Sylvain P.,"Victoria, Canada",3 star rating,Nice decorations in this salad restaurants chain with 5 locations in Montreal. Good thing is it was founded in Montreal in 2004.I think these kind of restaurant is more a girly thing cause i always think of salads as a side not a main menu. But my girlfriend and her 2 daughters like it. As a man i prefer vegetarian restaurant over salad restaurant were you always think there's something missing when you're done. I have to say it's very fresh but like tartar it has to be fresh or you didn't eat it.I also think it's a bit expensive 20$ for a salad and drink. So next time I'll passed my turn.
/user_details?userid=Gmm7aWeQrwpQbxpLf-3GyQ,Judy S.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"Hands down, Mandy's serves the best gourmet salads that I have ever had.  We ordered the Seared Tuna Salad and the Lumberjack. Each was so different and full of flavor. Salads are not cheap but you definitely will get a nice large portion. The seared tuna had wasabi ginger dressingmixed greens, arugula, kale, avocado, cucumber, edamame, super slaw, apples, tempura onions, toasted sesame seeds & spicy togarashi seared tuna. The lumberjack came with caesar dressingromaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, green onions, baked pita chips, mozzarella, bacon, deli turkey & chicken.

/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This is the closest Mandy's location to my place but I am not going to come here anymore. The Westmount location is a million times better. My order isn't complicated- I always get the Wolfe salad. But they somehow always manage to butcher my order. They either forget to add the Parmesan or the dressing is way too light. For $15 a salad I really expect more. Also, the lattes are a joke. Once I ordered the turmeric latte and the milk was not even lukewarm. Either go to another location or give Foodchain a try."

I also specified that I wanted it premixed. Both were not done when the salad arrived. I then tried to call Mandy's on crescent but got the voicemail every time. The voicemail then said that it was full. Pretty brutal service."

/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"This downtown Mandy's is always super busy and sometimes it's hard to find a seat at peak times. For some reason, their salads aren't as good as the ones at their Westmount location even though it's the same menu.  Still a decent bet to grab a healthy lunch if you're downtown but not my favourite Mandy's location.  Decor is nice and service is usually quick and friendly."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Though I am physically pained by the fact that I just spent $20.09 on a salad, I have to admit that it was pretty damn amazing! Picking up fast food/take out from the usual places is cheap, but deeply unsatisfying. Sometimes you're just craving a healthy and delicious salad. Mandy's definitely satisfies in that department.I've eaten in at this location once but mostly take out. The staff are friendly and although it is always busy, they are really efficient. So far, I've made a few ""design your own"" salads and  tried the Wolfe Bowl and the Reagan-Danielle Extraordinaire. I added mock chicken to both those salads for some extra substance. Though the ""chicken"" is tasty and filling, I'm not sure that it is worth an extra $5. Both salads were delicious and made with fresh ingredients. The portions are huge and filled with ingredients (they don't just try to fill it with lettuce to reduce cost). I think Montreal needs more restaurants like this. Possibly when there is competition, they will lower the somewhat ridiculous prices. Overall, the salads are delicious, the price is insane but even so, I'll continue to buy them on special occasions/once a week!Food: 5/5Value:3/5Ambiance: 3/5 (It gets pretty busy)Service 5/5"
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Famous Mandy's salad that I had to try. Being not a big fan of salad to begin with, I was not impressed after going to this restaurant. However, I would understand why someone would be pleased with this place.I went there for dinner. The environment of the restaurant was nice, with great hipster decors. The way you order you food is you go to the counter and choose your salad, then sit down and someone will come serve you your meal. As for the food itself, I usually find salads more a chore to eat than anything else. I just feel I spend more energy chewing the salad than the nutritional gain that I get from it. This salad was no different. The flavors of the salad itself were more or less enjoyable. I found by half the bowl, I got very bored of eating it.Overall, although I find the appeal of salads as a healthy alternative for meals, Mandy's has not changed my opinion on salads."
/user_details?userid=YDrRThaGP3Otqxf16zbyag,Maria D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"While the salads are a good overall a good size, taste is great, and decor is lovely.... the value for money is TERRIBLE. TINY/barely detectable portions of added custom ingredients, and in some cases paid ingredients are completely missing!   Only about 2 oz. of chicken per portion as well. For a $20 after tax, it is just not justifiable.  What i received was only worth $10. Salad Guru @ Alexis Nihon is a better value."
/user_details?userid=EepVyGQFBKjuJw1dorttyw,Madeline C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I find that Montreal is lacking in the salad/health restaurant department, so if you want a healthy yet satisfying meal, Mandy's is the place to fill that void. The lack of competition probably explains the somewhat outrageous prices, which is my only drawback. That being said, service is friendly and the atmosphere is incredibly welcoming. The outdoor seating area is also a huge bonus.I'd recommend it if you are willing to splurge a little for a healthful meal experience."

That's basically the summary of Mandys.We came here for a quick lunch, and took forever to order because there were SO many options to pick from. We ordered the Fave salad, the Miso rice bowl, and the banana-nutella smoothie to share, and were ASTOUNDED by the $45 bill (tax/tip in). That being said, everything was super delicious, and portion sizes were very generous.Would I come back? Maybe...but the prices are a little bit of a turn off to be honest. Overall, great food and great service but crazy prices for what you get!"

Whether you want to be healthy for a week or you want to enjoy a filling salad in a cute plate, Mandy's has a salad for every taste! I especially like their asian salad with crunchy ramen noodles, or the mexican salad as a healthy alternative to tortillas and dips. The restaurant itself is very pretty and hip, and the terrasse is lovely. However, the service can be a little slow for a place that specializes in salads. All in all, great healthy salads!"
/user_details?userid=nLvssaSephFYKHVjMd0XFg,Benjamin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Looking to recharge with some greens, my wife located Mandy's courtesy of Yelp. We tried two to share, the Wild Sage and the Asian. The Wild Sage is outstanding. Gave us some good ideas for future salads. The Asian is also very good, but more inline with other Asian salads we have had. Both salads had little items about them that made the salad more interesting - fried onion in Wild Sage and crumbled, dry ramen in the Asian. Good selection of tasty beverages to accompany the salads. We were there during rain, so unused outdoor seating made it a little crazy inside. And as others have mentioned, it can be a little pricey. But when you are on a weekend of eating heavy food, the cleansing aspect may be worth the money."

Holy shit was I wrong. This was the best and freshest salad I've ever had.  Roasted walnuts dipped in maple syrup, apples, ham, dried cranberries. What a combo. Tried the salmon salad as well. Fresh dill, asparagus, pine nuts, quinoa.... Wow!  Now I know why there was a line up out the door. Very busy for take out. 2 big community tables. Friendly staff. I'll be back! Bravo Mandy's, you brought salad to the next level."
/user_details?userid=oKaHY42t2hWxKLZg5PQv2Q,Madeline K.,"New Windsor, NY",4 star rating,"Let me start off by saying, I love Mandy's. But for anyone that is new to this lunch spot, there are few things I would recommend. 1- Do not go during the hours of 11:30 am and 3:00 pm. 2- If you do go during those hours, be prepared to wait on line, EVEN if you ordered ahead. 3- Good Luck finding any tables 4- Be very clear with your order or you will get things you didn't ask for. I am very fond of their mock chicken, I think it's a great option for anyone looking for something delicious. If you can, try to eat the salad at the restaurant because you will definitely get less when you take out. Finally, the cost value. If you are looking to customize your salad, you may end up paying about $25 CAD or more. It is crazy expensive for add ons."

The 95%, mostly 20 something, estrogen-power packed house gathered in front of large bowls of greens plus. With boxes of water! A couple fellas joining. One adult fella sat at a communal table with red meat tossed on his greens and a steamy bowl of soup. Salad that knows its worth. Not cheap: portions, nor price. Lots of choice. Create your own.

I wish we had something like this in Vancouver. Flavoured waters, juices, coffee. Nothing fancy but fun, young, eclectic and authentic.

Super yummy salads and a really wide selection, plus they offer a make-your-own salad option so there really is something for everyone. (I highly recommend the Wolfe salad- definitely my personal favorite). The atmosphere is also really cute and eclectic. The only downsides are that it is a bit pricey, and the seating is first-come first-serve so there's no guarantee you can find a spot (esp. when it's busy). Otherwise, it's an awesome spot and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a yummy salad place!"

/user_details?userid=hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,Alina M.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"I'd really give it a 4.5 if that was a thing.I visited on a weekday peak lunchtime hours (between noon-1pm) and the place was packed - all the seats inside were taken, almost all the outside terrace/patio seats were filled and the line was super long. Surprisingly enough though, the line moved very quickly and I was able to place my order in a minute or 2. Since I can be a picky eater with raw ingredients, I decided to customize my salad with - romaine lettuce, organic greens, blue cheese, feta cheese, avocado, rice noodles, sunflower seeds, and edamame along with a green dressing, which came to $12.49 +tax. The girl taking my order was very helpful and gave me 3 samples of dressings to try, since I had no idea what any of them tasted like, so if you're picky about your dressing and would like to try them out, they give you a small piece of lettuce with the dressing to taste and test out.Even though the restaurant was incredibly busy, there were constantly salads in large ceramic bowls being brought out and I go my take-out salad too within 10 minutes. This place is pretty dog-friendly too, as I saw a customer bring her dog in as she placed her order. On the side, in a fridge beside the cashier/counter there are bowls of some of the premixed salads, fresh juices, and small mini salads. They also sell smoothies and some sweets (cookies, brownies, etc.) on the side. I feel like the salads in the bowls are a little bigger than the take-out container ones, but even so, the take-out container ones are very large and filling, even mine without any protein. I did find that the majority of my avocado was at the top and all the edamame was the bottom, so it would have been nice if the salad was a little better mixed. There was also a bit too much dressing for my taste, so you can request for lights/less dressing when you order as well."

The salads are pricey but I find it justifiable for such filling portions. My personal favorite is the Mexi salad. They also have vegan options, and a make your own salad. The decor and atmosphere are really nice, the place is cozy, and the terrace during the summer is really enjoyable. Perfect place to go with friends."
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is where i like to get lunch on a weekday if i haven't brought my own to work. They have a nice variety of suggested salad mixes (endless summer and Cobb's are my favs) and you can choose to make your own. Portions are large and they mix in a little too much dressing for my taste - i always ask for half dressing. The atmosphere is pretty casual and cozy and the restaurant is bright with large green plants that are easy on the eye particularly in winter. I find the salads relatively overpriced (most are just below $20 after tax), specially b/c they don't use organic greens (they use free range eggs though)... Overall it's pleasant and relaxing to get lunch there and enjoy a midday break. Perhaps not economical for eveyday lunch, but good for a tiny treat every once in a while"

I usually order a Cobb salad, which is delicious, but this time I grabbed the Wolfe Bowl, an amazing mix of greens, nuts, rice and the amazing tamari sauce. It was a delicious blow of freshness during this cold winter evening.It's kinda pricey, but the free carbonated water kinda makes up for the fact that you are paying 15$ for a salad."

Three of us shared 2 salads and we still couldn't finish them. We had the fave and the habibi. I understand where the fave got it's name from; it was our fave."
/user_details?userid=e_jRFyF1nRRzP5h_5Nzziw,Ruth B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Mandy's is my go to place for innovative generous gourmet salads. I automatically feel skinnier when I step into those doors. However If I'm being 100% honest, I often order the Cobb salad which I'm sure is their most caloric salad but what can I say , the heart want what it wants...which is Bacon in a salad. I also love the pieces of baked pita In it because it makes it so scrunchy. Their salad are on the pricy side but they are very generous so you at least stay full for a few hours after. There's not much room to sit at this location but I saw that there's a bigger location in old port that I haven't tried. Even if there's a lineup don't be scared to go in because they are very effective. I tried the October salad and the superfood salad, they were both really good. Everything about Mandy's is well marketed. I love seeing local success stories. Being health conscious is in style, their decor reminds me of summer and California. Everything about this place is so ""Instagram pic ready""  from their boxed water to their funky bowl. I feel like you can't leave this place without a big smile on your face. Bravo Mandy's !"
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,I have to say upfront that I have never been a salad lover but I feel like Mandy's is one of those places that makes you feel like you're having a real meal and not just a salad. The place is very neat and trendy. It even has boxed water :O The selection is nice and the portions are very large. If you're not a big eater I would recommend sharing with a friend as they are willing to do 2 half bowls of the same salad. I would just say the price of what they charge for these salads is a little extravagant. I like their food but I'm not sure I can justify paying up to $15 for some veggies and toppings. Side note: they do have amazing fresh baked choco chip cookies.

Mandy's did not disappoint! There are plenty of salad options to choose from and the service is friendly and fast. There are also plenty of juice/beverage options from kombucha, tea, water, root beer to choose from.Thank goodness I stopped by to grab a salad before getting to the airport.

The staff is super friendly as well - the cashier noticed I was struggling with which salad (the choices all looked so good), and told me both a popular choice (Asian salad), and her own personal favorite (Wolfe bowl). They're super accommodating as well - I ended up opting for the Asian salad (greens, tomatoes, avocado, sesame seeds, crispy noodles, shredded carrots, ...) , and they allowed me to sub rice noodles for the crispy noodles, and dried cranberries for carrots! You can also add protein or other things for an additional charge. I think it is one of the best salads I've ever had - I really liked the creaminess from the avocados, and the dressing was very tasty as well. The portions are huge - it comes in a huge bowl (if you eat it there) - so it's super filling. Prices aren't bad either :) You're also given the option of creating your own salads.Long story short- lovely decor, friendly staff, super yummy salads, and generous portions. Can't wait to come back to try their other salads!"

Prices may seem expensive, but when you see the size of the salads and the amount of ingredients in each, it becomes more reasonable.

After trying it myself, I have to say I agree with her.  First off, this location is adorable inside with a modern airy décor and lively atmosphere. Service was impeccable, they were very friendly. they did not make any mistakes on my order and I got my food quickly.  The price is about 15-25$ (with tax) for their salads (depending on the selection and any extras), so while this is a little on the pricey side, what I can say is that the portion is VERY generous and it is very well prepared with fresh quality ingredients which they don't skimp on!  I had the Wolfe Bowl (Arugula+other mixed greens, shredded carrot, Parmesan, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, kale , lots of avocado, walnuts and sesame seeds + I added Grilled chicken). It was delicious and filling, everything was so fresh and well balanced with a nice light vinaigrette style dressing. The added grilled chicken was key, it really added to it. So while I think it would be too pricey to come here on the daily for lunch, I can safely say I will be coming back to try more of their salads."

This place lives up the hype.  Mandy's is the reigning salad queen. Before this place, I always hardcore judged people who ordered salads in restaurants. I mean, why would I pay to order something that I could easily make on my own? But then I finally gave in and decided to give Mandy's a shot. Best decision ever. I've gotten takeout from here and also dined in. Both experiences have been good! If you're eating in, there are some tasty hot sauces on the table! I always go for the Fave or the Wolfe bowl. I try to branch out every once in a while, but always end up going back to my #holygrail salads. The lineup for ordering can be long, but don't worry: it moves fast. I have literally eaten there like 15 times (no exaggeration) and every time has been a lovely experience. 10/10 recommend. One of my favorite spots in Montreal."

They also have juices, cookies, and soups which is nice, but if you come here you have to have the salads. My personal favourite is the Habibi salad, and I've tried three of their other salads (the asian, and two whose names I don't remember), all of which left me full, satisfied, and pleased with what I just ate. Grab their salads to go and eat them at the McGill quad when the weather's nice, also a fun idea!"

As usual, I scrolled through the pictures on Yelp and perused their #JaimeMandys hashtag on Instagram. Lo and behold, I found the salad that I had been searching for!I went at around 2 PM on a weekday and the place was still quite busy. The line up to order was about 5 deep, but it moved quickly. I ordered the Asian Salad to eat in and it was promptly delivered to my table. It was almost, but not quite, as good as I had remembered - possibly because I ordered mine only lightly dressed or because I'd been building it up in my mind for over a year... The portion size is perfect for me, but probably large by most people's standards =PThe place is vintage and bright and there is a variety of seating - communal tables in the centre, bar seating on one side, one or two tables with armchair (!) seats, and a few tables with bench and chair seating.

The only downside is that it's waaaay overpriced. The cheapest you'll pay for a salad including tax and tip would probably be around $15. And you could also end up paying around $25 for another salad (ain't no shame in being delicious, Man salad).This place is also always busy: crowded and packed, and lines all the way out to the terrace."

/user_details?userid=K95X5oE2-fuDZHhzFOfPUw,Meghan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've only been here once but I was very happy with my salad. You start off with a long list of items and you basically build your own salad by ticking the square boxes coinciding with what you want. I ordered a salad with romaine lettuce, black bean, blue cheese, walnut and avocado  with a cilantro-cumin vinaigrette. It came in a gigantic bowl and was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a small thai soup which I immediately regretted. First of all because the salad was enough food on it's own and second of all because the soup was just terrible. It was watery, salty and the vegetables were bland. Also, I don't love the atmosphere. The decor is generally tasteful but the tables and seats are arranged cafeteria style which for me isn't ideal. You might be forced to sit next to a stranger, which I don't really like. My friend and I grabbed one of the only couch/table scenario but we had to lean way over to talk because it was a little loud and the couches are far apart. I'm giving it 4 stars because I think if you ordered your own personalized salad to go and avoided the thai soup, you'd probably be very satisfied. It's always nice to have healthy meal options downtown Montreal."

When you get a good salad here, it's amazing! However, half the time, you will find a problem with your salad. Last week, the avocado in my Cobb salad was brown and I had it 5 minutes after it was prepared. This week, my man salad had undercooked flabby bacon. If bacon is not crispy in a salad, it is so unpleasant to bite and chew on pieces of fat!! A few weeks ago I had a great asian salad with extra chicken. The salad was good, but the added chicken was so dry I just discarded it. Taj soup is only broth with chickpeas, cauliflower  and shredded carrots. Also VERY oily for a soup. Taste is disappointing. Same broth they use in the matzo ball soup. Sometimes, they go very heavy on dressing/oil, so I ask for a bit less. The price... An abibi salad (lettuce, chick peas, tomatoes, etc, no meat) will cost you 15$. It never bothers me to pay high prices for my food, if it's justified by the ingredients, the type of cuisine or the location. In this case, it really isn't.

We have only eaten at this  location but I am sure the other sites are similar. There was certainly a lineup to order during lunch but well worth it. There is an option to order the themed Salads or you can build your own. I ordered the Tokyo Salad which I highly recommend. Prices range from $9-$12 for the salads and the portion as very big. It is has a great vibe to the place both inside and on the patio. We really enjoyed coming here for lunch and did come back more then once. Only recommendation would be for the Take out containers to be switched from Plastic to Paper. Let's be healthy to planet as well as our bodies."

/user_details?userid=zR2RIA8HL2YoRwuwy-4E6g,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Very plain salad that lacks flavor. The lettuce was bitter. I gagged and couldn't even go through half of my salad.All they did was chop the greens/fruits, throw them in a plastic cup, serve it in a hip tiny place and expect a tip on a takeout crazy expensive salad. I'm guessing in some people's book this is deserving of the price they are charging.I've tried salad places elsewhere where they are bursting with flavor and cheaper. This chain is not one of them."

The airy and light interior matches the salads perfectly. Great choice for a hot summer day."

They never seem to get my order right and I have never complained on missing ingredients I payed for but never got in my salad. But today, as I called to order my salad for pick up, I still had to wait about 30 mins to get my order, walk back to my office and realize there is NO dressing. NONE. I have had salads with very little dressing on it and still never felt the need to complain or go back. But enough is enough. I called and had to go back to the store to get my salad tossed in dressing. The lady appologized which was nice of her but that's it... She tosssed in a free cookie I guess to appologize again but I never asked for it and don't want it either... It is upsetting because I like their salads but I never get good service..."
