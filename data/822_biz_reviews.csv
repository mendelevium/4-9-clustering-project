We tried three different kinds of oyster: Kumamoto, Lucky Lime and BlackBerry point. The beef tartare is served on bone marrow, which can be scooped up and serve with the tartare to make it richer and juicier! Lobster cavatelli and black cod are both delicious. And the dessert just knocks it out of the park! The fried banana bread with walnut is soft and chewy, but not too sweet. Just the right amount of flavor and texture."

We were 4 then suddenly we saw 2 other friends so we decide to eat together. We asking to move to a bigger table and the waiter just carry everything for us even it was busy that night! I know that some restaurants does not do that for their customers.The food was amazing, the beef tartare and the wagyu burger was so delicious that i would definitely go back ! Definitely recommend to families and friends!!!"

Five months the friendly professional host said. The place is lovely! Modern and clean yet cosy. Fresh oysters and seafood and a few aged to perfection meats. Two bars. One of them for meats. Great outdoor patio. Can't wait to come back and linger over a menu and some good wine.
