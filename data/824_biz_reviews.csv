Everyone running around and people just chilling, having coffee, lunch, snacks. Doggy biscuit available for purchase. My wild berry smoothie was yummy!!"
/user_details?userid=CzgZt_C31sorjhGF4Wvqeg,Susan T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I like bringing my dog and my sister's dog here and I see people who don't own dogs go here as well. The place is spacious enough for smaller dogs to run around. The dogs really enjoy themselves here but the few times I've been here, the food and drinks were not great. I've ordered dessert here twice and the dessert was dry and fruit smoothie wasn't really good ethier. Its not worth the price you pay for the food. I wouldn't come here for the food but I always feel obligated to purchase something to drink or eat if I bring my dog here but I'll stick to coffee next time..."

/user_details?userid=I0qUNP9bMUNvlE7fWhvgsA,Stephanie Y.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,This was our first stop in Montreal for the little puppy to enjoy himself. It is a cute little cafe with nice options for food. The service was great and friendly. Sadly there was only one other dog there when we went but my dog had a nice time still. He loved his doggy ice cream as well!
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I want to give you all the stars Doggy Café, I really do! I also want to give all the pats to all the doggos. Pets! Cuddles!I was just there on a humid Saturday, since they have weekly breed meet-ups and I wanted to see real life Greyhounds! Come back another Saturday and it might be Chihuahuas, pugs, what have you.. The first floor fills up super quickly, so I was sent upstairs...where it was empty. Tragedy! I drowned my sadness in a very good fruity smoothie, and by the time my quinoa burger arrived, I had plenty of puppies to keep me company. The burger is very good, I recommend it, but the sweet potato fries were not well cooked. Thing is, this place isn't really for people who are dog-free. The dogs are more interested in other dogs, and owners are interested in other owners. Also, are you ready to see dogs leaving little gifts all over while you eat? I left having had a good meal, but not having given any pats, and that made me sad :("
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love Le Doggy Cafe! The staff is wonderful and kind, the vegan/vegetarian menu is great, the smoothies are tasty and best of all, my dog freaking loves it here. I had the quinoa burger and it was delicious and my pup had one of their homemade dog biscuits which he inhaled within 2 seconds. For the amount of dogs that come in and out of here, the place is surprisingly clean, smells good and has a ton of room in which to roam, work and play. The atmosphere really changes depending on the dogs and their owners, but we have always had a blast here and my dog never wants to leave."
/user_details?userid=1YUH30tmBeNe6Emuz72P0w,Sarah J.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place! The food is honestly some of the best I've had (even though I'm usually not a big fan of vegan food), and the people are SUPER friendly and helpful. When we went there was only one other dog, and my pooch spent the entire time cowering under a table (she gets nervous easily) but the people were extremely understanding!The service was a little bit slow, but honestly none of us really cared. (There was only one staff member, and she had only been working there for five days). Again, the food was amazing, and definitely worth the wait! They also have a nice selection of books to read if you get bored. Would definitely visit again!"
/user_details?userid=qA3BnzBRU5qOUPugiLk2Ow,Tina B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",5 star rating,You can take your K9 inside and order drinks and sandwiches. Delicious! I love the grilled cheese and quinoa burger.  Best part my dog had a great time.  Giving it a 5 star for that as most dining does not allow dogs inside.
/user_details?userid=9kLPuapKfGjF6ipVSqIuSQ,Ashley P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to this place hoping it would be similar to the ""cat cafes"" in Montreal, in that there would be resident dogs to play with. No such luck, but we went in anyway. Doggy Cafe is a place that allows dog owners to chill with a coffee, while their four legged babies frolic as they please. It's nice and quiet (depending on how vocal the dogs are) and I could see myself going there for an afternoon of reading or studying or watching dogs run around and be silly. The menu consisted of smoothies, hot drinks (lattes, hot chocolate, etc.), juice and a small meal menu. My chai latte was very good.The service was friendly, but unobtrusive. After we were served our drinks, we were left alone, which we found kind of nice. Although, when it came to paying our bill, we had to wait around awkwardly for the person who served us to come out from the back."
/user_details?userid=3gEdy3WjvohONXge1xmeQg,S A.,"TX, TX",5 star rating,Best place to be if you are a dog lover. Smoothies and juices are fantastic! The desserts are outstanding. Pad Thai can be skipped for a perfect experience. The service is superb as well.
/user_details?userid=Wy7mrJg9ea6FZhw9Rmdgvg,monica d.,"Natick, MA",5 star rating,"What a wonderfully Unique awesome fun place for your dog! My whippet had the best time! The food is lovely, yummy and lovingly prepared. The drinks are very good as well, had an amazing chai latte. I wish we had a place like this in my town, lucky Montreal pooches!!"
/user_details?userid=bW4u7uX7zeorspb5nqH0kQ,Jonathan H.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"Great place to grab some coffee and relax. The staff was friendly and even though I did not have a dog with me, it's a wonderful place for dogs to hang out and get all the love and attention they could want from their owners and other guests and dogs."
/user_details?userid=mnoILLcDbJa1ir2wDs3ASw,Afnan M.,"Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Although I left my dog in my home country, I've been here twice one time for a doggy birthday and the other casual visit, and it's doggy paradise! The place is small and cozy but have everything your dog would need (except for potty, you need to take the dog out) the staff is really nice and understanding if your dog had an accident. I only tried their cappuccino and it was good. I will definitely visit again."
/user_details?userid=fzdGX9PVFeO-BaNEw0VtIg,Jason L.,"St-Leonard, Canada",5 star rating,"It was so fun,  the atmosphere was calm and the food is really good.  They do not skip on the cheese in their grill-cheeses."
/user_details?userid=tHR1-sTUdGFsnQSIE-d92Q,Tommi F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Our new favorite weekly tradition: walk over to Le Doggy Cafe and let our pup go bananas with the other dogs. All shapes and sizes playing very nice together. Well-behaved dogs, respectful owners and delicious vegetarian food = heaven. Get the quinoa burger!"
/user_details?userid=fgIH00O7FvoVeOF_Ivkerw,Shulin T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"What a great place to spend time with your beloved pooch! The environment is clean and smells good, unlike others that I have been to. It has a good selection of healthy food and pleasant service as well."
/user_details?userid=tFga4vd_Fb_h4QrxBPRAiQ,Ana Paula S.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"Food is literally awful, and you could make better if you put no effort at all. Sad, because staff is really nice and space is cozy and filled with pups!"
/user_details?userid=FV-SJMp2o8xW07vWCiaiag,Sindeyrella ..,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The menu is simple, but contains ingredients for good clean eating. Vegans and vegetarians will find tasty snacks here.  The decor is sparse but I think intentionally this way to accommodate the dogs who are permitted to accompany their owners inside. Plenty of room for them to circulate off leash, there are even private booths for dogs/owners who need more space. Service is friendly & unpretentious.  This place embodies the Plateau style.  A must see if you love dogs."
