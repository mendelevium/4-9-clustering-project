Made my order in store for pickup and they brought the food to my car when it was ready, 10-15 min wait time. Food was delicious and packed great, highly recommend!"

Kind of fancy for a father son meal but I was curious The place was empty on a Tuesday evening. We were greeted with warm towels and a friendly waiter. This place specializes in sushi but offers a limited selection of cooked dishes. There is a blank menu for you to fill out your choices from many options. We choose the meal for two. We added two additional choices being big eaters. It was what seemed to be a long wait when the food arrived. Our meal arrived on a elaborate tray which was very appealing. The food was delicious. Well crafted and pretty. We ate it all and probably had room for more. It pleasant, quiet, fancy and clean. No one came in for takeout. I don't know if they deliver. We enjoyed ourselves. Maybe next time we'll go a la carte."

They are so nice and friendly and they really make an effort to deliver superior quality sushi. It is so good, at one point, I was eating here once per week. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good quality sushi."
