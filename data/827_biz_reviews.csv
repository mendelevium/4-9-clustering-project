I have waited a long time before trying their sushi for the first time. I got them delivered to me to the hospital through Doordash. It is pretty fast and the time prediction was quite accurate. The delivery guy Zahid was very nice and offered a great service. I ordered three items for share with two other friends: Yanh Maki (eel on avocado with interior stuffing of lobster), Madonna maki (tuna salmon) as well as Beatles maki (lobster with salmon), I loved the three items, particularly the Beatles, which are as beautiful as tasty. Saint Sushi is very famous for their iconic beautiful sushi and I am so happy that I can share with my friends inside the psych ward this delicious meal on a Friday night. TGIF!"
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I discovered their original location on Duluth over two years ago but this fairly new location is definitely closer to me, trendier and has a fantastic vibe! My ultimate favorite is the Sapin/ Christmas tree. If you haven't had these yet, please do, you won't regret it & will thank me ;-) Since I love the texture and taste of the Christmas trees, I also ordered the Lobster Sensei roll. The filling was great but the rice paper was too thick (similar texture as fresh spring rolls paper). I would have appreciated the roll if a finer rice paper sheet was used as it was challenging when trying to eat- perhaps something they can improve on.Overall, great place to go for drinks and or simply to satisfy your sushi craving. Note: this is not a quiet place, music is loud so If you are looking for a quiet meal, this wouldn't be the ideal spot."

The place itself is very beautiful and the staff is quite friendly. The music playing in the background have this place a cool and inviting vibe with the chef being all smiles!The food though could be better. Although I didn't order à la carte but rather the lunch combo, I find that they all tasted the same and lacked character for this type of rolled sushi. It came with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the latter and enjoyed it :) Somehow both locations menus, which are the same reminds me of a sushi joint on Laurier street not too far from Papineau-you know which on I'm talking about ;)Maybe I'll try à la carte next time."

On top of that, this restaurant boasts a beautiful, modern aesthetic and nice service! Come here for the Christmas Tree sushi! It is simply divine. I had the tasting menu, and the Madonna roll is wonderful too! The King Of the North cocktail packs a powerful punch! It is simply delicious. You will feel as though you are basking in the warm sun of the Caribbean.Service was top notch. When I walked in, the waiter said he only cared about our comfort! You don't see this level of personable attention too often in the restaurant industry. The only recommendation is to lower the music volume. Sometimes, it is hard to hear your companion over it's loud beat!"
/user_details?userid=-Ds0hzlQwZUukmOwnapaFg,Cassie M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5 star rating,"Best sushi in Montreal. We made reservations and sat at the bar. It was entertaining to talk to the chefs and watch them make the sushi, it was like watching art. Their house made sauces (some type of ginger sauce/spicy mayo) are delicious. Our sushi chef Alex was awesome - I hope he goes on Chopped Canada someday. Saki bombs were $7 and totally worth it (although they need taller glasses), I guess they might not used to a crowd that does saki bombs lol"
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of Saint Sushi I was really happy to see that they opened a new location on the west side of town as this is closer to home and work for me. The quality and creativity of the sushi remains and you can expect to enjoy all the same rolls that you've enjoyed at the original location. Two reason cause me to give the Greene location 4 instead of 5 stars. The decor of the Greene Ave location leaves a bit to be desired. It's a bit cold and starch and lacks the homeliness of the Duluth location.  Additionally, when I first started going to Saint Sushi their prices we were incredibly inexpensive. I think it was $25, tax in, for the tasting menu. Today's prices have increased a considerable amount, but rightly so. Today's prices are very reasonable, but no longer the super deal that they were a few years ago."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm a fan of the OG Saint Sushi in the Plateau. I'd been there once and fallen in love with their tasting menu. I was so excited when I heard that they opened up a Westmount location. We went as a group of 4 on a Friday night. We were seated right away and I have to point out that the service was honestly great (which is refreshing in Montreal). What I like about Saint Sushi is that their staff genuinely looks like they're having fun. The main difference is this one is a little more upscale and they have a full bar unlike the other location.The music was WAY TOO LOUD but despite this, we still had a great night. The 4 of us got the tasting menu which means we got to try a larger variety of tartares and sushi rolls. We started out with the salmon and tuna sashimi plate, followed by the tuna and lobster Christmas tree tartares. All of them were amazing! Previously, I had only tried the salmon sashimi and lobster Christmas trees so it was cool to try new variations.We also got to try way more sushi rolls, including Bob Marley, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, etc... some were better than others but to be honest, I wasn't sure which was which coz it was too loud when the waitress was explaining the rolls.Overall, great experience and I would go back but maybe chill with the music, you don't have to try so hard to be trendy coz you already are!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love the sushi at the original location so I was so excited and happy to find out that they opened another location closer to home! Saint sushi is one of my favorite sushi restaurants. I had to wait for my order which was fine because the staff members are so nice, smiley and chatty. Normally I get the tasting menu which is so worth it! This time we ordered 2 Clydes for pickup which contains sashimi or salad (we got the salmon sashimi with apples cut julienne style), 10 makis, four nigiris (two salmon sashimis on rice and two tuna sashimis on rice), with two Christmas trees. Christmas trees are cone shaped tartare on a rice cookie. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I love the lobster and the salmon one. Unfortunately this time I felt the rice cookie was a bit stale but the tartare was still good. I love the decor at this location. It's definitely bigger and fancier than the first location. I love the white walls, the nice shiny floors and the plants. Next time I will come back and eat at the restaurant because wait for it ... there's alcohol at this location!!! Yayyyyy! I was told that the saint old fashioned, king of the north and professor plum cocktails are the favorites and I can't wait to try them! I love the names of the sushi rolls and the cocktails.Now the reason I gave this place four stars instead of five like the other location is because the sushi rolls they gave us were nothing special. It was the chefs choice and I love their other rolls much more like the Beatles or the Bob Marley.  Also like I mentioned earlier the rice cookie was stale and usually it isn't."
/user_details?userid=S3KMGLJsbVMTy7-WXiIjjA,Steven O.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"The new location lacks the decor and atmosphere of the original, but the staff is still incredible and the true heart of the restaurant. I come here more for the service than the quality of the sushi. If you don't sit at the bar I feel like the service is harder to enjoy compared to the original where you feel like the whole restaurant is connected. Prices have gone up a tad, but I'd still recommend their tasting menu or Yanh Maki. Their cocktails weren't totally my taste, but they sure are pretty to look at."
/user_details?userid=LB1dC42iB6WSjPVPwt3Zqg,Meg K.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went for my bday with my boyfriend. Ordered the salmon Christmas trees, 5 rolls and drinks. Everything was amazing. The chef was phenomenal, very funny and outgoing . He gave us a special sauce-Ask for the coconut spicy mayo (a lot better than the original one). Favourite roll was the lobster roll wrapped in cucumber; it was different and came with amazing fresh sashimi on top. Wonderful bday dinner"

/user_details?userid=Ojw_XFMmxvKQJ65lJHseDw,Derrick C.,"High Park, Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Terrible. Tasting menu $32 is all bland rolls. Service is slow and not knowledgeable. Sake wasBlah and took forever to warm up. Loud music, couldn't even carry a conversation. Table of 5 squished into 4-seater table. Avoid this place."
/user_details?userid=JMdqyfVosoR3n8_DvKzfMw,A L.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"I usually don't write bad reviews but my last experience at saint sushi was unbelievably unprofessional. You would think that when you receive a salad with a piece of plastic the size of your thumb in it that we would not be charged for the replacement.... false. We were charged for the replacement. We were also charged for drinks that we never ordered but were told by the staff to have since they made the mistake. I have worked in the service industry for most of my life and I will tell you that I will go to every other sushi restaurant in Montreal besides this one just based on this experience. If you are going with a group of friends to this restaurant, cancel your reservation and make it somewhere else because they will tell you they are out of the cheaper sake bottles just so you order the more expensive one. They will also charge you for food that you send back."
/user_details?userid=j_ywrYvgiy63z1paw-ToUQ,John G.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Thought I'd try out their Westmount location and was somewhat disappointed. Service was OK at the bar, took a little long to get served. Portions were on the smallish side, expected some differentiating dishes but, alas, none presented. Same old, same old. Run of the mill and definitely not worth the price premium."
/user_details?userid=eHvBFf8RP4dBnRvo_NuZ4w,Yasemin A.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The freshest fish I had in Montreal! Original and creative recipes! We had the tasting menu it was really good and my favourite was the Christmas tree. However the chef could add more variations to the tasting menu as every sushi we had was filled with the same salman tartar. The environment is very beautiful staff was friendly including the chef! I recommend sitting at the bar to see what he's preparing.
/user_details?userid=TBOwg26n7wm9PDtZTU4YhQ,Rheanne P.,"QC, Canada",5 star rating,So fresh and everything tastes amazing. Would definitely recommend. I got the tasting menu which was so delicious. I liked the christmas tree & the Bob Marley the best.
