/user_details?userid=eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ,Donald S.,"Boca Raton, FL",4 star rating,"Today I find myself at Snowdon Deli, a very much traditional Jewish deli. My mission? Well I'm in search of the elusive famed Montreal smoked meat. Before we jump into this, I'll go ahead and address the elephant in the room. Yes I know this is not Schwartz. Their queue is insane, not that I've let that stop me from good food before. But I will tell you what has always been my road block, cash only. I NEVER have American dollars, yet alone Canadian. Lucky for me, Yelp nation has clearly made it known that Snowdon is every bit as good, or even better than those other guys. Back to the subject at hand. Snowdon features classics like knish, matzah ball soup, latke, and even liver! Their even baking there own caked and pies. But of course smoked meat is king. Very similar to our American pastrami on rye, the sandwich features mounds of meat and a slab of mustard. What's great is even though the meat may appear to be overwhelming at first glance, it's super tender, making wrapping your mouth around this sucker quite achievable. The meat itself is flavorful and the mustard only adds additional punch to the flavor profile. A great sandwich overall. Also tried the fries, which many mentioned were not to be missed. Although I love the crispy texture, there is a sweet component that I am not at all used to being in fries. Personally not a fan. I totally get why this is a thing. Now the whole Montreal smoked vs American pastrami debate....I won't even touch that. Let's remain friendly to our neighbors up north:-)"

I've heard good things about Snowdon Deli so I made the trek out to check them out on a late Wednesday afternoon. The inside is very diner-esque. The place is split; takeout on the left and the restaurant on the right. Tons of people were grabbing food to go. All the older Jewish folk were knoshing ;)The menu is surprisingly massive but let's be real, why else would you come here if not for the smoked meat and other Jewish specialties? The waitresses working are friendly and seem to be ones that have worked here for ages.- Smoked meat sandwich ($9.75) - got mine original, medium fat with mustard. Delicious. Generous slabs of smoked meat and perfect balance of fat to meat ratio. - Potato latkes ($4.75) - these were crispy but prepare for the grease. Somewhat flavourless. Even the dip didn't help much. Get something else instead.An institution. 3.5 stars."

A true Jewish deli since 1946.  Not the oldest in Montreal nor the one in guide books, but if you want authenticity and  quality with few tourists, this is the place for you.Smoked meat.  Brisket, very well trimmed but with good internal marbling, brined like corned beef but with more sugar, rubbed with spices like pastrami but unlike either, smoked.  The end product is a juicy, pull apart tender, stunningly flavorful meat bomb.  Order by fattiness (lean, medium, fatty).  Each represents a different spot of the brisket.  For the best, just say ""Old fashion"".  Medium fattiness sliced from the sweet spot of the brisket (where the fattier point sits atop the leaner flat with a layer of fat in-between for good measure).  The textural difference, leaner in one bite, in your face, fatty goodness in another makes the mouth all kinds of happy.Hand sliced, thick, served on light rye bread a smear of mustard the only condiment.  You can barely close your mouth around the pile of meat and bread.  Stunning.Tip:  If you don't like overstuffed sandwiches, order the smoked meat platter.  Served with several slices of rye bread.  Make your own sandwiches.Tip:  Grab some karnatzel to go.  The lightly sweetened, garlicky, herbaceous, dried beef sausage makes the perfect snack.  Very friendly, very fast counter service.  Inexpensive at just over 10CAD for a 1/2 lb smoked meat sandwich,  4CAD for a full length of karnatzel.Other traditional Jewish deli specials offered, none sampled.  Seriously, you're here for the smoked meat!Stunning, and the perfect example of what the full flavored spirit of Montreal is all about."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A dying breed, Snowdon Deli is a Montreal institution. Despite being native to this city, I didn't grow up on Snowdon Deli. I didn't live in Hampstead or CDN. Growing up in Montreal West, Famous Deli Boys (aka: FDB) was my family's old school deli. These are two similar restaurants serving homemade Jewish food to eat on the premises along with an extensive takeout counter.Sadly, Deli boys was sold after countless generations of ownership by the legendary and perpetually grumpy duo of Chico and Sonny. The new owners kept things largely the same, but ultimately closed down the restaurant a few years ago. This tragic closure signified the disappearance of the greatest cheese bagels and potato salad in the galaxy bar none. There's no substitute for foods that have been enjoyed and etched into the unconscious during one's formative years. Snowdon Deli does an OK job at both cheese bagels and potato salad. It won't change your life, but it's still tasty. Where they excel however, is in their smoked meat product. As I've alluded to in a previous review (Reuben's Deli), Snowdon Deli's smoked meat is a hybrid between the old school dark red marbled brisket (Schwart's/the Main) and the more processed, peppery ""wet version"" of the product (everywhere else). The fat is omnipresent as is the marbling. This is truly a delicious version. It is vital that this restaurant survive and thrive for there remain very few like it. Back in the early 90's, in addition to FDB, you could also go to Ben Ash in the CSL shopping centre. A little deli in Alexis Nihon plaza downstairs also comes to mind. There were others. These institutions, along with their paper placemats, old laminated menus, small water glasses, and largely uncomfortable booths should be exalted and romanticized. Unfortunately, Snowdon Deli is now largely a geriatric social club filled with those regulars who know better than to get swept up in the latest fads. It closes at 7:30pm and doesn't serve alcohol.(what's the point if your demographic is an elderly Jewish crowd?) The prices are beyond reasonable. My wife and I ordered a smoked meat omelet, a smoked meat platter, potato latkes with apple sauce and sour cream, and 2 cokes. Including tax, the bill was less than 40$!! Try that at Beatrice, Taverne, Lucilles, Tuck Shop, Liverpool.......blah blah blah. You'll barely have sat down before the meter hits 40$. More importantly, these restaurants can't hold a candle to an old school smoked meat sandwich with all the trimmings. Alright... some of these places are pretty awesome, but Snowdon Deli is at least as good an experience in my book."

Not only one of the cheapest meals I had in Montreal, but maybe best.From pictures I figured it had to be dry but had to try being in Montreal and all. I've never been happier to have been so wrong in my life. It was juicy, sweet, hot, tender. Just really amazing.Didn't bother with fries, salads or anything else, just the smoked meat sandwich (white not rye), and definitely not the lean meat option. I was waiting for my friend who already ate so I started eating by myself. After the first bite I started laughing to myself it was so good. Ordered another once my friend got there to share with him - note that he's uncommitted/weekend vegetarian who already had lunch and he still loved it."
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've heard good things about this place and I always wanted to try it. I was in the neighbourhood and felt like a smoke meat sandwich so I decided to give it a try.Snowdon Deli is located on Decarie Boulevard near Snowdon metro. It is on the same side as the old Snowdon movie theatre. I went there around 11:00am one morning on a rainy day and it wasn't crowded. In fact, I was the only person at the restaurant portion of Snowdon Deli and I was seated immediately. There were some people at the counter ordering take out.I was given the regular menu along with a lunch menu and took a look at both. I was somewhat surprised that I didn't see a smoke meat special/trio on the lunch menu. As such, I decided to go for the smoke meat platter (~$15). The smoke meat platter came with some bread, 2 pickle slices, fries, and of course smoke meat. I had the choice between lean or medium and I opted for medium. I also had a choice between old fashion and regular and decided to go with the old fashion which is generally the tastier/spicier of the two options at most smoke meat places that I've gone to.A few minutes after ordering, the waitress brought my smoke meat platter. It looked and was delicious. The only thing is that I got the end of the bread slices so my first 2 slices of bread were not that large (you can see the picture). This made putting the smoke meat between those first 2 slices of bread difficult.The only thing missing was some coleslaw and a drink if I decided to purchase it.I thought that the food was very good. My only complaint about the service is that they don't automatically refill the water at the table since I believe that the water is already in the glasses so they just put the glass of water on your table. My glass of water was empty for a few minutes before I had to ask for more water even though the waitress passed by my table to ask me if everything was okay (and at that point, my glass was almost empty but she didn't refill it or replace it with a full glass of water)."
/user_details?userid=0GDUNDb32COiNF0k3nXIvw,Jim B.,"Frankfort, KY",5 star rating,"There is nothing about this little deli that I do not absolutely love. The food is incredible. The staff are friendly and accommodating. It is so good that it warranted two visits during the same vacation.I had never experienced ""Montreal style smoked meat"" before. I had read about it and even seen a segment or two on the food channel about it but I was definitely not prepared for how incredible this thing is. I had it in my mind that it would be very much like the pastrami sandwiches that I love to get whenever I visit New York City. Was I ever wrong. Smoked meat is pastrami on steroids. Best I can tell they start with a brisket. First it is cured with a spice rub and left in the fridge for a number of days to cure. Then the spice rub is washed off and the brisket is allowed to soak for a number of hours while being turned often. Then another rub is applied and it is smoked low and slow. So far it sounds like any other pastrami doesn't it? The next step is where the magic happens. After it is smoked it is steamed which leaves you with a divinely tender and moist meat that is then thinly sliced and served with mustard on a good mild rye bread. Pure heaven!! I highly recommend that you add a serving of the vinaigrette slaw and a pickle. Then just sit back and enjoy a true miracle of a meal.Yes, of course I purchased a couple pounds to bring back home with me. My Mama didn't raise no fools."

This is a nice touch that I really appreciated.I wanted eggs and smoked meat, and as I was fumbling through the menu my waitress guided me to exactly what I was looking for.I like the overall staff involvement in your dining experience at Snowdon Deli. A lot of places will plop a menu in your hands and leave you to your own devices. That wasn't my experience.The serving size is generous but not excessive. I ordered medium smoked meat and found that compared to say Dunn's it's on the leaner side, which I don't mind. The scrambled eggs weren't quite as fluffy as they could be, but the potatoes were great. Crispy on the outside and cooked up with oignons.Overall, I'd say Snowdon Deli is a decent local place to go for breakfast (served all day) with great service and all the classic Deli fare you might want.I'll definitely be back, and would bring friends and family here."

Smoked meat sandwich was delicious; almost as good as Schwartz's, but just lacking a little bit of texture. We also had a grilled deli meat sandwich on a hamburger bun. A little one note but really tasty. I'm a big fan of grubby classic restaurant interiors but there's a fine line between character and dirt. Snowdon edges a little too close to the latter for me.

I dropped in on a late Saturday afternoon for a take out sandwich and it was not busy.  Staff was friendly and made the recommendation of a smoked meat sandwich. They asked me what cut I liked and I said for them to make the choice.  Sandwich was $9 cad which was fair. I got it on rye but you can get it in a bagel or other bread for an extra fee. Good sized portions. The taste of the sandwich was okay. It wasn't warm or hot which is a negative. Also the cut he gave me was too tender and didn't have that crusty taste to it. Worth a try but not sure I will come back.

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Deli Snowdon is part of Montreal's culinary history.  It is a traditional, Jewish deli that opened way back in 1946 and is still around today.  You'll find all the staples of the Jewish deli on the menu like matzo ball soup, karnatzel and smoked meat. It's in a bit of an awkward location lying along Decarie with not much around it.  There is some street parking available but that is about it.  Inside the place is a little dated and could use a bit of a facelift.  It is pretty big though so getting a seat is a breeze.On this particular visit I thought I would go with something traditional like brisket. This came served to me on rye bread and it was drenched in gravy.  The meat was juicy and tender and I really enjoyed it.  I also had a side of onion rings which were only so so.  There was a little too much batter and the portion was pretty small.  Also they have cherry Coke and I mean Coca Cola, not some imitation brand!  This is one of my favourite soft drinks yet it is hard to come by here in Canada.  I always have no trouble finding it in the US but here you really have to go looking for it.   Needless to say this made me happy!The prices are reasonable and I paid about $16-17 for my whole meal which is what I would have paid anywhere else.  It's an interesting option if you find yourself in the area but I'm not sure it is worth a detour."
/user_details?userid=hR6dUJqimBHwIKssts6VOQ,Lillian C.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"I have to admit i don't think I really like Montreal smoked meat so take this review with a grain of salt. I've had some Montreal smoked meat twice before but all I presumably wrong places (once in Vancouver over poutine, once at a fast food joint in a mall in Quebec City).My SO's car got rear ended while driving from Quebec City so we stayed an additional night in Montreal when we intended to go to Maine. We decided we ought to try a proper Montreal smoked meat sandwich but no way in hell was I going to wait in -19 degree weather for Schwartz's (not to mention I tend to avoid cliched tourist trap restaurants) so I did a little googling for what would be a good alternative. I found many comments about this being as good if not better than Schwartz's so we headed out here for our last meal in Montreal for the time being. I ordered a regular (less peppery) smoked meat sandwich, medium fat on rye, with a side of fries and some coffee. The SO ordered his ""old-fashioned"" but otherwise the same and with a matzo ball soup instead. The coffee was fantastic- this is great deli coffee and they're generous with refills. We don't have weak brown water coffee where the refills come only with the check. This ain't no Stumptown roasters but might I say this is a damn fine cup of coffee. The matzo ball soup- not so much. It was literally a mushy bland matzo ball in a pool of neon yellow chicken broth made from bouillon. Avoid at all costs, it tastes like a ramen seasoning packet. Now for the sandwich- it's pretty good! The meat is piled high and served hit which is fantastic for a cold winter day. Unfortunately I don't think I'm sold on Montreal smoked meat. It was like a blander version of pastrami. It doesn't have then complexity and smoke of pastrami, not to mention I wasn't a fan of the bread. I like my rye to taste very much like rye and peppered with seeds. Good bread on a sandwich is half of the sandwich battle in my book. Now my favorite part is this whole meal was the fries! One thing I love about Canadians is that they know fries- no shoestring crap, no nasty inedible chalk coating, amazing crisp yet tender golden brown fries. Amazing. The perfect texture. I'd return for some fries and coffee in a heart beat (and excellent service!) but I wouldn't be sad if this is my last MTL smoked meat sandwich ever. Maybe it's the greasy patriotic American inside of me but I'd choose pastrami over MTL smoked meat any day of the week."

I enjoyed Matzo Ball Soup that could only be improved by adding more vegetables and having alternative broth. The latkahs were amazing and are a must try. If one are looking for an affordable, quick, and authentic Jewish-Canadian experience, Snowdon Deli will not fail."

Apparently this place has a reputation for, how do we say, ""service with personality,"" which is probably why I avoided dining here in the first place. But i was feeling adventurous, no to mention craving smoked meat, so off we went. The place was busy but not full, so we were seated relatively quickly. Our server, while seeming a little pushy, ended up being super sweet. Ordered the two eggs with smoked meat. Solid. They know their meat. The rye toast that came with it was also exceptional. This place has been around for a while and you can tell. But that's the charm of it, right?"

I recently swung by Montreal, coming from Ottawa, and bringing Snowdon Deli home to my family warmed my heart. Everyone has favourite there! It's such a classic spot that is even a favourite of my Montrealer parents, and all of their parents. Picked up some bagelah (sp?), which are like little bagel/blintz clouds, for my mom. She loved them and they're exactly the same as from her childhood days as a lil' Montrealer. Basically, it's bagel dough wrapped around the cheesy filling for a blintz. We also picked up some latkes and knishes. No complaints. Just classics. Also! They were open on Dec. 26th. These guys just don't quit it."

It really does give it some sort of magical charm which is translated to its staff because my waitress was the kindest person ever.

They are open at 6am and close at 7:30pm every single day except Fridays. They close an hour earlier on Fridays.  Visited this place on Saturday morning , the place was still empty when we arrived. I ordered the breakfast place with 2 eggs , smoked meat, home potatoes, fruit garnish and white toast. I also got 2 latkes with sour cream and apple sauce and sour and half-sour pickles. The home potatoes were tasty , they give you a big portion of it. The smoked meat was decent, the fruits tasted fresh and the white toast was so good, my partner got the rye bread and that was even better ! My favourite part of the meal was the potato latkes. They were amazing ! So crispy yet chewy and gooey inside, with some sour cream and apple sauce , delish !!! I would come back just for their potato latkes. The server was also super friendly."
/user_details?userid=GBJ0bNvQUuAPqrBLN-aRrQ,Olivier V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So here goes my first Yelp review. I just moved back to Montreal and I had this crazy poutine craving that needed satisfying ASAP. I've always heard of this deli but it was always out of my way as I lived downtown. So I bravely typed up the words poutine near me on google to find that Deli Snowdon was the closest and best reviewed near me (thanks for the yelp). So I sat down in a booth and was swiftly handed a glass of water and a menu by this old lady that moved faster than me (clearly I won't be this mobile at that age, she must be icing her ankles in the back) I look at the menu and decided on the premeditated victim and added a smoked meat sandwich, with pickles of course. I glanced at the beverage section and couldn't find the beers so I asked for one anyways but sadly I was denied by a smile and a head swivelling from left to right. I therefore retreated to a coca cola. As I was waiting for my order a gang of old people rolled in and they all knew each other, I felt I was watching a senior remake of save by the bell. Shortly after I was bombarded with my order. As I was scarfing down my poutine without even looking at the smoked meat sandwich I soon realized there was no way in Hell I was fishing all that food and also thought to myself that there was even less way in hell I was waisting any food; something had to give. In the end I was victorious over the smoked meat but the poutine over me. I left the deli slightly disoriented not even realizing I just paid 28$ for a sandwich and a poutine, but I must say that it did the job; a craving was satisfied."

/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I came in for a smoked meat sandwich, medium fat, traditional style (""more spice, more flavour""). An increase in the price of brisket has sent Schwartz's sandwich price from $5-ish to over $9 in the last few years, but Snowdon's was around $7. It was wonderful, as always. Snowdon's fat spectrum maxes out at medium, so while I do like the fatty option available at Schwartz's, I think that both places should share the ""best smoked meat"" crown. This visit, I noticed a plate of smoked meat arriving at the table next to me as I bit into my sandwich. The slices were lightly marbled with fat, glistening, sumptuous, bulging, and I found myself wondering if I too should have ordered the plate -- the better to apply the smoked meat directly to my mouth, with no bread intermediary. I was floored when the customer complained bitterly about the meat, describing it to the waitress as carelessly sliced and ""prepared as if it was dog food"". The waitress and another staff member were unflappable, replacing the plate with more uniform slices and explaining simply that if something was not right, they would fix it. No one in any line of work deserves that treatment; I'm not sure what we've all done to earn their tolerance or their beautiful food. But it's there, and you should go eat it if you're the meat-eating kind, and please be nice -- it doesn't get any better than this."

Typical deli layout with a counter for takeout and smallish tables. We wanted to have the Montreal smoked meat experience so we ordered the smoked meat platter to share. There was a huge platter of sliced smoked meat, which looks like a combination of corn beef and pastrami, and tastes a little like both, but milder. It came with a mound of fresh french fries, not the usual frozen and fried kind we get in the US. We also ordered the matzoh ball soup, which was outstanding. The food was delicious. The atmosphere meh. Glad we went and would definitely return. I might add that parking was a bit of a challenge."

It has better smoke meat than Schwartz- consistent and never dried out. And the fries are better too. Now that's saying something! They have plenty of great quality food on the menu and pickup at the counter even if it ain't terrifically healthy for you. Just go - your arteries and stomach will negotiate some kind of deal afterwards.Oh and it can get loud during weekend brunch hours in a Jewish way. You're either immune to it or you'll find it quite annoying.

That's what I tasted anyway.I'd HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend getting the smoked meat sandwich with liver. OMG. Chopped liver. SO GOOD. That kind of sweet, gooey liver (it has caramelized onions in there, I can taste it), contrasting with the smoked, slightly salty meat is a match made in heaven. Totally delicious.I also tried a few pastries. Stay away from the danishes, and the apple turnover was okay but they didn't peel the apples so I got a few bites of apple skin (yuck). I could tell it was homemade though, the sauce inside wasn't cloyingly sweet like the packaged stuff, and it wasn't an apple puree but had actual little chunks of unpeeled apple in there.I'd come back for just the smoked meat sandwich, with the liver. SO GOOD."

/user_details?userid=-mgMPrTPd7p7uB6bdPdGGQ,Howard P.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I've tried many and Snowden is possibly the best deli in the world and easily the best value, on par, or better than any in New York or Baltimore.  My only regret is that I did not buy more takeout - which made the trip well back to Washington, DC and I had no problems with the sometimes intrusive border inspectors.  Great delis are an endangered species.  Snowden has a rich and varied menu -- more so than crosstown tourist favorite Schwartz's (also an excellent deli).  I ordered the smoked meat (less dry than Schwartz's and a bit less spicy), corned beef, latkes and kasha kinishes.  All were among the best I've ever had.  Snowden is sort of hard to find, not downtown, but is about 3 blocks from the Snowden Metro stop.  Everyone at Snowden was also very friendly to an USA resident who knows little French.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Montreal and next time I'll take much more food home to the USA."

/user_details?userid=Q-P20elQEc2kKcPBK7cgzw,Amy O.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,I love Snowdon's and finally had a chance to get back there this summer on a day trip up from upstate NY. If you like Jewish delis---then by all means make the trip out to Snowdon's. The smoked meat sandwich was amazing. I can't remember what style it was--traditional? Something that sounded like the less healthy option. GET THAT ONE! Yum. We did take out and got so much from the case. There isn't a deli that good out here in San Francisco and there certainly isn't any smoked meat. Can't wait for our next trip east!

/user_details?userid=0N7WtyqcrhEbLdcZz85YcQ,james h.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4 star rating,"Grew up in Montreal and used to go here as a kid on the occasional Saturday morning, with my dad and his friend, after a morning of playing chess with them. They would get the ""regular"" more fatty smoked meat sandwich. I always opted for the leaner one as I had quickly developed an aversion to gobs of fat in my food. It was still a very good and formidable sandwich for a young kid, and the last one I ate must have been 25 yrs ago. I remember marveling at all the interesting looking preparations behind the counter and wondering what they were and how they tasted...    Fast forward 25 yrs and to San Francisco where out of the blue last week I developed a bad craving for smoked meat.  If anyone knows where I can get some in the Bay area, please let me know."
