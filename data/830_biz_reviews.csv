They have 3 / 4 pizzas at all times (Mariana, Margareta, specials). In the Fall I went and was completely blown away by a zucchini pesto pizza with stuffed zucchini flowers on top! They have simple and gourmet options to say the least.They also offer pasta and starters. I went for a truffle themed week and loved that pasta dish! Ravioli is always great as well :)  Super authentic, warm family vibe, and a cute baby! They just started doing delivery as wellLeave room for dessert! The calzone with Nutella and ricotta is amaaaazing! I return often to try their rotating menu that fits with the seasons. Super reasonably priced!Note they do not have a liquor license, but they do have great Italian sodas! Always good to take a break from the booze now and again :)"

Finally we decided to go early one evening and man was it obvious why it was so hard to get a table--the food is amazing!We tried a couple of the pizzas and the gnocchi and it was among the best Italian dishes we've ever had. The gnocchi was fresh and tender and the tomato based sauce was delicious."
/user_details?userid=VqYGz0rl-yh95Nk_i95Edg,Nick C.,"Jamestown, NY",5 star rating,My wife and I came to Montréal for our honeymoon. On our last day we ventured further away from the Old Town. We started a conversation with a friendly woman on the street who said we should come here. We did and it was the best place the two of us have ever eaten. The ravioli with tomato sauce was incredible and the gnocchi with ham and mushroom sauce was delicious. The desserts were out of this world as well. You can tell that everything is made with love. Magnificent!
