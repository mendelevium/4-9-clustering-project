/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Impressive interior and dishes. I had walked past this restaurant hundreds of time when I lived in the mile end but never gave it a second glance. I'm so thankful that my friends recommended eating here otherwise I might not have pushed myself to give it a try!Everything I had to eat and drink was delicious. The Tom Yom soup had so many layers of full-bodied flavors. The spring rolls didn't taste frozen; the chicken skewer and peanut butter dumplings were extremely satisfying. I can't recall or find the name of my main dish but it was a semi-spicy coconut curry with a side of sticky rice. There was a choice of lamb, chicken, duck, shrimp or vegetables for the main dish. I can't rave enough about the food. It's the best Thai restaurant I've ever been able to have the pleasure of eating at. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I shared a dinner menu with a friend and had more than enough to eat.The interior is lovely and if you reserve in advance you can ask for a table where you sit on cushions on the floor. I hope to return again soon and will definitely be recommending this restaurant to friends and family."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time visiting a Thai restaurant in Montreal and I was very impressed!Visited Restaurant Thailande on a Friday evening after work with friends. We had reserved the traditional-style raised cushion seating beforehand - I highly recommend trying this out at it is a great experience. You have to remove your shoes then unroll the cushion and prop yourself in the space. It is sooo comfy! There are plenty of tables however if you prefer.The ambiance is warm and intimate, great for a date or dinner with friends. The staff are very friendly and respectful, regularly filling water glasses up and bringing the food out quickly.For starters, we ordered the 'Mee Krob' - crispy noodles marinated with shrimps in sweet & sour sauce. It was OK - I would not order it again as it was quite simple and something I could make at home. We also had the 'Por Pia Tod' Deep fried egg rolls (which were delicious!) and the 'Kiao Satay' Dumplings in peanut sauce (tasty and great for a small group to share as you get about 15 small dumplings)For mains, we had to order the famous 'Thai Green Curry' (Kaeng Khiao Wan) made with coconut milk, basil & shrimps. It was delicious, lovely with sticky or steamed rice.  We also had the 'Kaeng Panaeng' curry which was spicier and very tasty. My favourite however was the 'Pad Kimao' - spicy rice noodles with hot chillis and onions. Extremely flavourful with the perfect amount of heat. Overall, great first experience of authentic Thai food and culture. Prices are reasonable, food is flavoursome and charming ambiance. Highly recommend :)"

I really enjoy their dishes, they're absolutely delicious! I ordered two main dishes and two salads for two people and there were a lot of leftovers. Staff is helpful and friendly. However, their prices are too high for what the food is."
/user_details?userid=FCoOfa1Xp2GGSopTOz_vWQ,Connor F.,"Owen Sound, Canada",5 star rating,"Simply the best Thai food I've ever had in Montreal, and possibly anywhere. The Green Beef Curry is transcendent, a must order, and everything else I've had is great as well. Super fun and friendly staff also. A step above in Montreal Thai food!"
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very authentic tasty food. My boyfriend took a table d'hote which let us taste a few different appetizers. The coconut lemon grass soup was very good but slightly too spicy. I had a curry bowl with coconut milk, potatoes, pineapple and duck. It was so good! Completely different from Indian curry which I hate. The sticky rice was excellent to dip in the sauces. I found the portions very small for the price but in the end we were all full. The decor is also very nice. Unfortunately you don't actually sit on the floor like the traditional way. Its more like sitting on an elevated platform with the table below."
/user_details?userid=XSKwtZUl6wdZqhgF15bqBg,Florence L.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants! Over the years, I never had a bad experience! The staff has always been very friendly and can help recommend the best dishes! Went there as a big group, a small group and on the traditional floors and always had a wonderful time with family and friends. The spiciness ratings can be a little off on the menu sometimes though. It can get a little loud at night but nothing too unbearable. The bathrooms are clean. Always happy to go back!"
/user_details?userid=On1ALp8QfwEp8ZLI3o_OzQ,Steven U.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We ate here for prior to New Years Eve festivities and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The service was fantastic as well. Pad Praram (sauté with peanut sauce, cashews, and crispy spinach). Easily our favorite dish of the night. The peanut sauce here is savory and very good with the chicken. Yum Neua (grilled beef salad tossed with onions, bell peppers, celery, mint leaves and coriander). Super tasty and the mint added a unique touch that made the dish perfect as an appetizer. Highly recommended. Pad Himaparn (sautéed cashews, dried hot chilies, bell peppers, and onions. This dish was enjoyable but the sauce was very light and did not have much flavor. The chicken went very well with the cashews, vegetable, and spices. Kiao Satay (chicken dumplings with peanut sauce). We ordered this as an appetizer and wow. The peanut sauce was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The dumplings were bite size, perfect for an appetizer. Tum Yum Kha (lemon grass and coconut milk soup). This was a light and super flavorful combination of soups and was the perfect starter. Contained many mushrooms. Creme Brûlée (jasmine tea flavored). Our expectations were low but this was good. Definitely prepared fresh."
/user_details?userid=VZtaiqj40IF36qs2JnQaeg,Marisa K.,"Kansas City, MO",5 star rating,"I was walking around Mile End and stumbled upon this cute place. I wanted a light lunch, and the veggie spring rolls + Thai coconut curry soup were perfect. The soup was AMAZING. I only tried it because I'm vegan and it's the only soup they have without chicken broth. I'm so glad I tried it! It's also quite cheap, and it's very cozy inside. They even have a section where you can sit in cushions on the ground!"
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Looks like a fine restaurant. We dined on the floor to get a more ""authentic "" feel. The food was alright. We had dumplings for starters and for mains we had yellow curry, eggplant stir fry and beef curry. The dumplings were good but the peanut sauce didnt work out too well for me."
/user_details?userid=8LKkuosn2ZMYY0CXN4Uu2g,R C.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Quite surprised by the positive reviews as our experience as a table for 4 was subpar. Upon arrival for our 7pm reservation (made via Open Table) I checked in with the staff. The host/waiter seated us immediately but did not give us menus. After 10minutes of waiting I asked a different waiter to provide them. Then the initial waiter took our order and I asked for sliced lemons for the table for our water glasses. He came back with two sliced limes which is not enough for a table of 4. Then the order came quickly where I asked for additional hot sauce, but the waiter forgot. The food was mediocre and truly lacked flavors that reflect the delicious and authentic Thai cuisine. The waiter also never checked in with us to ask how our meal was. When we asked for the bill the waiter insisted that we pay in cash, which we politely declined as credit card was an accepted form of payment. Overall the experience was unusually strange through these cascade of events throughout our meal. Unfortunately none of us are in a rush to return. The two stars are for the prompt seating and the quick turnaround for serving our food order."
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",2 star rating,"One sparkling water, one thai tea, and one seafood coconut milk tom yum soup...25$. Man thats one steep bill. We also had the green curry and red curry. Green curry was not spicy at all. The red curry dish was much more flavorful and had an authentic thai spicyness.The crispy duck was not even crispy at all. The shrimp pad thai literally had 4 shrimp....like really???? Youre joking right? Flavor was decent but noodles were too wetI enjoy the duck salad. Beef salad was dry chewy as hell....PS. All mushroom you see looks like they come straight from the can. 150$ total bill. An alright place but wont be coming back any time soon. Phayathai is much better if you ask me."
/user_details?userid=r4Kac9JDnig5oCO8-tNFmQ,Melody M.,"Rowland Heights, CA",4 star rating,"Pretty good place! I will typically base my rating of Thai restaurants on the quality of their Pad Si Ew, and this place was a-okay. It had a very nice interior, the waiters/waitresses were very accomadating and the food came out very quickly which is always a plus. So, the Pad Si Ew itself. Not bad, but not excellent either. The noodles weren't as large and flat as I'd like them to normally be, it was a bit on the oily side, the beef was a bit tough, and worst of all, the dish had American broccoli instead of Chinese ones! That's usually a big alert to me, so I was pretty skeptic at first. However, once I had a few bites, it wasn't too bad.Overall, it was good for its price ($13.50) and the dessert I had after was very nice :)"

And oh yeah, just lovely well-cooked and seasoned food. Sticky rice and spicey perfect eggplant and red curry duck and fire engine rice noodles are a good way to my heart almost any time, but on a Monday night with a bottle of inexpensive Vivolo and wise ladies... well we're talking super swell and many stars."

/user_details?userid=BnywXOmsaeNYIKJQWaQIlQ,Sharon Z.,"Foster City, CA",4 star rating,"Great classy atmosphere, savory thai dishes that's made to impress, proper Thai spiciness that's retained in every dish.Boyfriend's brother recommended this place and we decided to come here as the first Thai restaurant experience in Montreal one night. I gotta say, I was a little skeptical when I walked in the place. Mostly because the ambiance is very nice and the restaurant is labeled as fine dining Asian cuisines. Though I enjoy nice ambiances, my best authentic Thai dining experiences (from the food perspective) always comes exclusively from hole-in-the-wall restaurants.The menu is in Thai with some descriptions in French/English, a great sign for authentic food. I ordered Pad Kimao (otherwise known as drunken noodle) and boyfriend ordered Pad Prik Khing (a chicken dish cooked with ginger and beans). Being a lover of spice foods, I asked them turn the spiciness for my Pad Kimao to the max. My Pad Kimao was sauteed to perfection, the scent of basil heightened the flavor of the dish; the spiciness from the chilli peppers was well placed and fully expressed; the chicken was thinly sliced, tender and flavorful, especially with a dash of garlic on top. What a beautiful and tasty dish! Boyfriend's Pad Prik Khing was also delicious, with rice on the side, the ginger and beans were sauteed with chicken in a spicy sauce, the flavor was even more pronounced.Overall, I was very pleased with the experience! It's more pricey than your normal Thai places, but the plating is beautiful, ambiance romantic and the food wonderfully tasty and authentic, well worth the price."

The waiter was very attentive and took our orders well even when some people had last minute changes. However, the food did take a long time to come out. We ended up ordering the classics like pad thai and soups and we came out pretty satisfied."

Service slow, took more than an hour to receive our food. Had to ask 3 times for hot sauce cuz it was taking too long. The only thing positive id say is the decor. I am not gonna go back there again, waste of time and money."

/user_details?userid=lGhtC6yJlzfDUe4wjZ6ArA,Kristine B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Their curries are as flavourful and delicious as curries are in Thailand (you can't go wrong with any of them)! Excellent Tom Yum and mango salad. Pad Thai was decent but was missing something I can't quite put my finger on. Meals are a touch expensive for what they are, but still tasty enough to warrant it on occasion. Skip dessert, it's kinda meh."
/user_details?userid=Mt7q9U48KiAJKivYRB5vog,Corinne R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is one of those really great places to bring a large group to celebrate all of lives milestones while consuming large amounts of rice noodles, coconut curries and salad delights. It is very large, and service was a-ok for the group of ~15 that I went with. I ordered the green mango salad as a main (as I had decided that poutine + sangria directly after yoga and before such a meal was a very sound decision) and was really happy with the price/quality ratio. The salad was really delish - accented with mint and cilantro and lime (I think!) and topped with shrimp and was ~10$. Not bad! Also! Have you ever had thai iced tea?! Well I have not, but I tried my friend's and it tastes like a sauna in your mouth. For real... it is smoky in flavour and almost woody. Go there and try it and lemme know if you agree!"

/user_details?userid=dPw3YdhvbdY7wVL6N_Y6yw,Carmel B.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",2 star rating,- Made a reservation for Valentine's day based on positive reviews- Food was fresh and authentic- Service made the experience unbearable. We waited 30 minutes between each course and the bill. The total dining experience was 2:30hrs.- We were beginning to fall asleep at the table with the amount of time it was takingOVERALL: Food was good but didn't justify the wait. Won't be going back. Sorry!

In particular the papaya and mango salads are just divine! Its great that all their dishes can be ordered in any meat/ tofu option so there is a ton of choice... sometimes making it hard to decide. But whatever the decision, the food is always excellent. The service is friendly and helpful, and the owners are super nice. Once my friend's car got towed away while we were eating, and the owner drove us around in his car for 15 minutes till we found it. This is the best Thai food I have had in Montreal and I highly recommend it. The price is slightly more than other restaurants, but it is well worth it."

/user_details?userid=2qKaHzMcM2s8GtoA-ovUhQ,Hoots A.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I have to say, despite all the glowing reviews I found this place to be totally mediocre. I love love love Thai food, so I was very excited to give it a shot. I had a fish Tom Yum Kha soup to start ($4.95), which was tiny and not very flavourful, except for being too sweet. For me the whole point of ordering that soup is the rich coconutty base, but alas, I couldn't taste the coconut at all.Next up was vegetable Pad Prik Khing ($12.95) which is is a kind of spicy (not really) thin red curry sauce. It was ok, but nothing special. The vegetables (only broccoli and cauliflower... really?) were a bit over cooked as well. The sticky rice was sticky rice, what can I say?That said, I'm hoping I just tried the wrong dishes this time and will try it again. The floor seating area looked too cozy to not check out another time!"
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A great Thai restaurant in a great neighbourhood. There are so many conversation pieces in the decor - the highlight being the shoes-off seating area - that it makes for a great first date place. But if that doesn't help break the ice, the food probably will. The pad thai is spot on and the curries wonderful. The staff is also friendly and attentive. The only reason I don't go there more often is that it's not cheap (expect to pay about $20 per person including tips for just the main course)."
/user_details?userid=sgO-FwBPk9ILVodd9H-QMQ,Lawrence B.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,Good food in a very relaxed atmosphere.  This is the place to have dinner if you are thinking asian and then heading over to hang at the Waverly or Cafe Olympico or maybe grabbing some good Scotch at Whisky Cafe.

/user_details?userid=8RRwMkf3SOxv7AcYZyRFMA,Sandy L.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I feel the place is a bit over rated. Me and hubby always look for nice Asian restaurant to go to every Sunday evening. The decor is quite nice so we didn't expect cheap food but as long as it's worth it. We ordered papaya salad to share. The flavor was good but a bit sweeter than I prefer. The portion was. Quite small.  As usual, he ordered Pad Thai chicken which came out a bit too soggy but again the flavor  wasn't bad and the price is reasonable. Though we've had better Pad Thai at many Asian resto. I tried their Hormok Plat (fish steamed in banana leaf). Again flavor was good, but the fish was so mushy that it fell apart. It was just really watery. The iceberg and basil in the sauce were all gooey and over killed. There were just a few bites of fish in that whole banana bowl. The rice was extra charge.  I find the same dish at  la petite Mangue at a much lower price and a good amount of fish that isn't watery like this. We also ordered two drink at first. He took bloody Cesar which was so disgustingly bitter that he had to stop half way through and ordered another glass of white wine instead. I had a rather not so cold piña colada mixed  instead of blended and icy cold. The bill came to well over$100. The waiter was friendly but the food and drinks were a bit of a let down. Considering the atmosphere it wasn't so bad but I wouldn't go back just for that."

Waiter service was prompt and efficient, nothing to complain about really; my only critique would be that we could only order drinks from one waiter, and had to wait until he came around to take our drink orders. Menu has a lot of choice, but I was a little disappointed with the portion sizes. I had decided to not take the Table d'Hote because I thought it would've been too much food, but in hindsight, because of the smaller portion sizes it would've done me just fine. I had the peanut butter dumplings to start (shared with Danny), and Pad Kana Namman Hoi as my entree. I also shared a plate of chicken fried rice with Danny, but were left still hungry at the end of our meal. Don't get me wrong, the food was very good, but the price for the portions we got left something to be desired. I would recommend this place, but would suggest taking the Table d'Hote  if you don't want to still be hungry after your meal."

I like the atmosphere and the service, but I usually do take-out these days.  I love the Kaeng Panaeng curry, and their Pad Si Ew is also good.  They deliver to the neighborhood, and are very friendly.  It can get a bit pricey when you add in the rice (sticky rice is soo yummy), but I find myself going back often."
