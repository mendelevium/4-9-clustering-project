It was my birthday so my friends and I tried multiple cocktails and all of them were really refreshing and not watered down at all. It was a little loud and if you don't like that dim bar vibe, it's not for you. I love that kind of thing, so it was great. Food was on the pricier side but as I was a tourist visiting it seemed like that was typical of most of the restaurants in that area. Pork shoulder was incredible and the Mac and cheese was great too!"

Sat at the bar, and our bartender was fun and joked around with us. We asked about Absinthe and he bought all 3 of us a shot of it. I had the Perfect Iced Tea and it's so yummy! My friend has a dark and stormy and they make a very nice one."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Menu isn't anything amazing at least not the sharing ones. we made due as we showed up for oystermania so I wasn't really looking to eat anything else as I had another oystermania at Joverse 2 hours later but we did share the cheese and octopus which was good but wish the cheese had more honey as it's fried goat cheese so it's very overwhelming. Octopus needed a bit more flavours but it was a great dish.Drinks were good but a bit steep.The vibe here is cool but there was a huge party in the back enjoying a family party with slides of their vacation playing which took away from the actually restaurant.I would come back for drinks but food wise prlly not as much.
/user_details?userid=ZighfCv43MPj6MgyidpwQg,Xuenie Z.,"Flushing, NY",3 star rating,"If I were to come back, I would definitely order the warm goat cheese salad again. The fried crust of the gooey goat cheese dripped in sweet syrup on a bed of salad was the only highlight of the night. Though the waiter was friendly and attentive, our drinks took 15 minutes and food took over half an hour to come. Our waiter was making our drinks and handling other tables as well. Severely understaffed both front and back of house. Minus one star for the under seasoned bison tartare. Other highlights were the decor, music playlist, and strong drinks."

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here on new year's day for an 80s poplife party hosted by DJ Esan Ellis. For a freezing cold day, the event was a nice way to warm up -free street parking and no crazy long lineup to get in with a packed crowd inside. Decor: very typical bar/lounge setting as typically found in Old Port. Oddly enough the art work leading up to the second floor reminded me of South Beach with the neon coloured graffiti pop art.  You can't miss the large disco ball by the DJ booth! There was also a large dance floor. Drinks: the cocktail menu was very elaborate, listing their most popular drinks to my favourite old fashioned list. Phil who was the bartender serving me made a mean old fashioned. All elements were perfectly measured and garnished. I had the after-war and the Chimney (which had smokier notes -hence the name implies). I liked the second one better. The drinks are pricey starting at 12$ and easily adding up- I was still satisfied. Service: ask for Phil!! Excellent service.I am looking forward to come back one day for their oysters!"

/user_details?userid=cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ,John T.,"Nashville, TN",3 star rating,"3.5Came here for last call and, for a late night bar, I was pretty surprised to see things so empty. Granted, it was a Monday night but closing time seemed to come a wee bit earlier than my local host anticipated. The bar staff was very pleasant to let us have a drink but there was no atmosphere of which to speak. I imagine that in a more populated time, L'Assommoir could be a very fun place. As it was, my experience there was slightly... awkward which was a buzzkill from the fun I was having earlier in the evening. Rather than the perfect place to end the night, LND became the place where the night sort of just... fizzled.Seeing that it was late and a bit on the cool side, I opted for the Jamaican Espresso: rum, Tia Maria coffee liqueur & cold espresso. There might have been some whipped cream/chocolate action on top. I'm not admitting to anything. The drink was just fine for what it was supposed to be: a dessert nightcap for a late night. The Tia Maria was a bit too bitter for me and even the sugar from the espresso & whipped cream (ugh; admitted) wasn't able to offset it as much as I would have liked. This isn't a drink I'd normally get at a bar but for an after dinner alternative to coffee, it'll do. Sorta. I'd need to come back to LND on a busier night and order a drink drink (maybe some apps as well?) to really get a feel for the type of place it is. As it was, it's a-ok."

The drinks were good too, bit on an expensive side, but then again, it's common for Old Montreal area to have those prices. My 3 stars are solid 3 stars and I'm sure I could have probably given more if I liked the vibe of the place, but I'm afraid I didn't really. It just didn't feel like a place I would go with friends, but I guess it's better suited for tourists and 5-7 after work drinks with colleagues. Still, it's worth checking out to see if you like the place for yourself."
/user_details?userid=wHKMaG7I0PFseg9uVkEFDA,Veronica L.,"Cambridge, MA",1 star rating,"We had the oysters, the nachos and the cheese plate. The food was very over priced for the quality, which we should have expected given that the menu is all over the place and there is no theme. A good restaurant has a speciality, this one has none.The vodka drinks that were served with the oysters had no alcohol. To make matters far worse, the manager made a very gross sexual comment about one woman in our party. I've never seen such disgusting behavior from the manager of a restaurant."
/user_details?userid=2XHr-Pdqqdp__sgK3pcKZQ,Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"Stopped in at a weird hour (little past 3:30pm) hoping to get a couple cocktails and something to nibble on to hold us over for a later dinner reservation.  They were participating in the Invasion Cocktail week so they offered a bunch of new/newer cocktails to celebrate the week. Overall, the drinks we tried were okay, not great.  Our first round, the Bergie En Chest was definitely better than the Peach Julep and the Mexican Hipster for our second one.  As for the apps, we should've done our homework and checked the Yelp reviews before we sat our bottoms down on those bar stools.  We opted for one of the Samplers that included plaintain chips, ceviche, salad, veggie quesadillas and calamari.  Sounds like it would be good, right?  No, regrettably a hell no unfortunately.  The calamari batter was too much.  It didn't showcase the actual calamari well and the plaintain chips were all stale. The veggie quesadilla wasn't terrible but also wasn't memorable and the ceviche didn't have that lime citrus zest that all ceviches should have.Final verdict?  Come here if you're feeling down to try some adventurous cocktails but do skip the food here unless you really don't care what you're having."

It's quite a busy restaurant (especially on a Friday night)!For the occasion of Tartare Fest. we came to Assommoir because their price is the most competitive (10$ including a tartare among 3 choices: salmon, beef, ""cerf"" with a choice of wine between red and white). Salmon tartare was so good! Sweet and tender. Beef tartare is rather salty but still quite good. The white wine is quite decent and red wine too. We also ordered fried calamari, which was rather plain.The service was quite good and the staff is friendly, I would come back again!"

/user_details?userid=NaX4Gi2FYosbn4kXj5bM3Q,Deanna Z.,"Long Island, NY",3 star rating,"Came here for late night drinks and apps after traveling to Montreal from NY. The place has a pretty cool ambience-- the back of the bar is lit up, there's high top seating, a huge disco ball, music, and upstairs seating. Seems like the perfect place to come for a light bite or a fun date. We came on a Tuesday night and it was pretty packed. Our waitress was very, very nice. She had a lot of suggestions when it came to our drink orders-- I ordered a cosmopolitan and she informed me that she had a previous customer from the US order this drink and was unhappy with it. Apparently the make the cosmos different in Canada, so she directed me to other drinks. I got the Melontini, which was so good (fresh watermelon juice and vodka). My mom got the Santa Maria, which was recommended by our waitress and wasn't on the menu-- she loved it. My dad got a Moscow mule and it was very good. For apps we got the beef cheek pouting and the ceviche. Both were very good. We wanted the oysters (which were selling for a dollar that night) but they were sold out when we got there. My only complaint was that, when we ordered our second round of drinks, the bar took SOOOO LONG to make them. We probably waited 15-20 minutes for them, and the table next to us were complaining about the slow service as well. In the meantime, we saw the bartenders taking shots with friends instead of making the drinks. Besides that, I recommend coming here for a late night bite or drinks. Their food and drink menus are extensive and the waitress was lovely."

This place is located in a touristic area. Makes absolutely no sense to me.We also sat at the bar early (around 6:30 pm) for a drink or two before dinner. It took about 20 min for the waiter to come get our order. We were like 5 clients total at the bar. He was too busy having a discussion with other clients. After we finally got our order (Moscow Mule), the guy served us 10-15 min later, and had put the drinks in regular glasses when my friend said this drink is always served in a copper mug. I also asked him for a napkin that never came.Very disappointed in this place. I brought my friend there thinking this place was good and we both couldn't wait to leave."

I placed my dinner order with the water/busman and asked for some bread twice. 30 minutes later nothing showed up.  I finally gave up and paid for the one glass of wine that I ordered an hour earlier, and went elsewhere for dinner.

However, the waiter that we got, was kind of pushy and a little too cool.  Like he was friendly, but wasn't very interested in our table as the guy at the table next to us was spending a ridiculous amount of money on alcohol and would obviously pay a bigger tip.  At this same time he kept making expensive suggestions on the menu.  I found that to be unpleasant.I think if we had a different server, my experience would have warranted more stars.  Maybe next time?"

We decided to stop in for a drink, we had 9pm dinner reservations somewhere else. When we arrived, it was quite busy we were seated at the bar which was perfect because we only wanted a drink anyway. The waiter told us that 5$ drinks were on, and showed us a drink menu. My guy ordered a beer, they didn't have a great selection but he picked one from their list, and I asked to see a wine menu. The batman told me they didn't have one, so I ordered a glass of ""white"" wine and received some terrible thing that I could barely drink. I didn't finish it. For a bar, there should be some kind of option for wines? Even if it's written on a board or something. When the bill came, my wine cost $8. I mentioned to the barman and asked about this ""$5 drinks"" thing.. and he told me it didn't apply to that (awful-generic) wine. Ha ha. Gouge much? Anyways, I can't say much about it, we didn't try the food but the dishes we saw being served looked good. The whole experience with the obvious price dishonesty left a poor taste, as did the quality received. Something to also note - it's very much a "" young persons"" place, loads of early 20's hipster types conglomerating there. I'm sure they receive $5 drinks, target market."

The only things I didn't like about the atmosphere was that the music was much too loud to be able to talk over, and there was one tv that was on just above the DJ stand. I got the beef tartare and a side order of whiskey-maple poutine. The tartare was delicious but the poutine was meh. I'd go back again, but likely only for drinks and dessert."

Tapas options allowed us to share dishes with me and my Lady. Artichoke Dip was great, the Beef Ceviche was tasty and well presented, and the calamari was super tender and fresh. But of course, they specialize in drinks, in which the menu was extensive and well made, even categorized. Albeit my drink came out in a girly glass, but I should've expected it by the name, 'Tropical Blend'. Still delicious. Good music, ambience, vibe and decor.

I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert.Because this was during the Mtl à table festival, I paid a set price of 39$ for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54$?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. Another thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low."

Right in front of my company he told me that that was a terrible tip and even in the States that would be bad. I'm not even sure what that meant .I could go on about the tip amount being okay or not, but whether it was or wasn't he had no right to try and embarrass me in front of my company.

/user_details?userid=wVrq-IUyYHo2dpeDXYbWjg,Eric K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Most unsatisfied with our group dinner at L'Assommoir. We were there at 20:30 and ready to order but the waitress was finally able to bring the appetizers at 22:30! Very slow and sloppy service. She poured me a glass of water and spilled half on the table; she smiled dump and didn't even bother come back and clean. I had to eat all dinner on a wet table. Despite the fact we told her that some of us are working the next day, she brought at the last course at midnight. Unbelievable!Now about the food. With such a protracted service damn right we were hungry and we'd have gladly eaten anything. Unfortunately the bifteck canard looked like surest way to get a gastro. Sadly it tasted the same too: too salty and disgustingly sweet. It came with some french fries which were oily, overburnt, and obviously reheated. What a terrible combination. My colleague had the same type of fries with her steak. We could not help to remark that the servings at the table looked more like cafeteria food than a pretentious restaurant.You might be curious about the decor. The ambiance was almost stressful noisy. The selection of songs played by a house DJ were enough to cause indigestion but by the end of the night we had all lost our hearing due to the loudness of the ""music"". Somebody told me that he judges a house by the cleaningness of  the bathroom. I think it is enough to say that they didn't excel in that chapter either.We should have been paid for what we had a bear the whole night nevertheless we were the one to empty our pockets. For what we paid we could have had an excellent meal in many other places.In conclusion: with bad service, bad food, and an overall noisy stressful ambiance,  L'Assommoir is the perfect place where to ruin your night. If you want your dinner to be over before bedtime then aim to be there at breakfast."

The crowd is young, loud and fun - there was a DJ playing live music - and the food is excellent.

We ordered the plantain chips which we awesome - although I doubt that they were homemade. It brought us back to our 5-week trip to Costa Rica. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit Quesadillas and I got the Green Apple & Salmon Tartare. He enjoyed his - wasn't blown away, but it was good. Mine on the other hand was amazing.

/user_details?userid=AvL-_Q_3MoQ57JcK02jwyA,Yasmine Z.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Aah, L'Assomoir. Such a dreamy place. (You know this is going to be a positive review.)This restaurant slash bar is the perfect place for young professionals...as well as older ones. Unlike its older brother on Bernard street, L'Assomoir Notre-Dame has a bar permit, allowing you to drink without having to order food. But you'd be crazy to pass by the delicious tapas, ceviches and tartars they offer. I personally love the ""Gueuleton"", a huge plate of appetizers for two, four or six people. One of the appetizers included in the ""Gueuleton"" is the ""Bonbons de saumon"", which is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's better suited for people who like raw fish, but one of my friends doesn't usually eat any and she loved it. You might be surprised, because it doesn't taste like anything you've tried before. If you're not so hungry, you can always opt for the GOOD STUFF: the booze. The large variety of drinks is quite astounding (over 200), with concoctions with quirky names like ""GHB"" and ""Biktini"". I can't say I've tried every single one of them - would that make me an alcoholic? - but I've tried enough to say your taste buds will thank you...your liver not so much. The combination of flavours is sometimes unexpected but always interesting.If you're concerned about your wallet, maybe L'Assomoir isn't the best place for you. However, if you're willing to spend around 50 bucks/person + tip for a good meal and a bunch of drinks, then this place if for you. The service is excellent, warm and the atmosphere feels young and hip, without being snobby or exclusive. It may not be the best spot for an intimate date, since L'Assomoir is often filled with people and noisy, but that's what makes it so exciting. I believe there's a DJ on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  And for all of you hockey fans out there, they have TVs, so you don't even have to worry about missing a game! Didn't I say it was a dreamy place? I sure did."

Not only were the doors open, but our party was received with a warm greeting, quick seating, and immediate drink orders. Service was friendly, the waiter asking where we were from and answering our questions about the menu.I had the crab tartare with avocado, which was lovely in both presentation and flavor. The crab was not over-seasoned, but a perfect mild taste which the avocado and the accompanying pain a l'ail. Everyone else in the party was satisfied with their dishes also, including two who ordered fish and chips. The restaurant took on the palaver of how to serve such a casual dish as fried fish by placing it on a wooden cutting board with tartar sauce smeared on the surface. While the presentation was a bit strange for my taste, those who ordered it enjoyed both presentation and food alike.Throughout dinner, there was also a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant, a quiet noise level, soft music in the background, and an intimate, yet refined small-room aura. The bar seems popular, and looks worth a return visit to check out."

To be clear:  this is not a bargain spot.  We dropped $30-35 over three drinks.  But in terms of what it sets out to be -- viz., a premium bar with professional barkeeps who make amazing drinks -- it executes beautifully.  If you have a taste for fine beverages and want them done properly, this is as good as it gets."

/user_details?userid=d3kEhf6hmEFmZsGmE-IXUg,Stephanie B.,"VT, VT",4 star rating,"I love L'Assommoir.   I have been to locations on both Bernard and Notre Dame.  The format fits my preferences perfectly:  Their drink list is extensive - notably, featuring many signature cocktail creations as well as an eclectic and upscale menu that includes a variety of small plates, specializing in tartares and ceviches (and grilled meats?).   Since the cocktail list comprises 250+ concoctions I can't say that I've even put a dent in the list.  I don't care for too much sweetness in my drinks.  I like the G.H.B, despite the name and I have ordered it a few times - From the web site (where you can see all their drinks) this is chartreuse verte, dry gin, kiwi & basil, dash each of maple syrup and apple juice.  On balance, I'd love to see a more extensive lineup of daringly creative cocktails, perfectly executed - innovative mixology  genius.  The cocktails featuring seafood are good, but are overpriced  since they're not outstanding.  I have tried at least two - you will basically have an average tasting cocktail, with some tuna or salmon on a little wooden skewer in your drink.  The small plates are eclectic, very well done for the most part and they frequently change their specials.  I've enjoyed their foie gras, accras de morue (cod fritters), ceviches and tartares (these you can mix and match for a set price).  On Notre Dame I had an unusual and especially delicious salmon tartare where the salmon was not cut into small cubes, but rather presented in strips and fairly thickly sliced with fresh mango (?)  I also really enjoyed the tartare de wapiti.  Their kitchen uses thoughtfully selected, high quality oils and seasonings.L'Assommoir on Bernard becomes very busy on weekends, but the music remains at reasonable decibels while people are still having dinner (not sure about later on).  It seems very popular for large groups in the back.  Reserve ahead or be prepared to possibly eat at the bar. But this is okay, the bartenders might do glass throwing tricks for you and show you as they light up your lemon peel.  Also, you could get personalized drink recommendations and chat with them about their craft.  The decor at the Notre-Dame location in Old Monreal is different from the one on Bernard.  It has a more upscale feel and yet it is a relaxed atmosphere, service is quite informal.  There is at least one television at one end of the room.  There is ample seating on both ground floor and upper level mezzanine.  The ceilings are high and the bar is made to look like an amber facade with solid paneling from floor to ceiling, for dramatic flair.  The bar is shrouded in soft warm amber light.  The shelves and big cubby holes along the back of the bar are lit so as to showcase the collection.  L'Assommoir certainly distinguishes itself as being fantastic for a late night bite, particularly on Sundays since most of the restaurants in Old Montreal do not serve past 10PM.  Here you can get the the full menu until very late every day, could it be until 3 in the morning?!!  Do not however, expect a crowd, since Old Montreal late after 11 on Sunday is extremely subdued (pretty much lifeless).  Though as a local at this time it feels home-y, among almost all locals.   I dock for service b/c it is inconsistent although it is perfectly acceptable for a bar.Check online for their live events (e.g. Jazz & DJs), also currently it looks like Ladies Night on the first tuesday of the month - print your coupon online and get a free two course meal with min. $10 purchase..."

It is almost like it couldn't settle on being just a bar with good drinks, they had to throw in the food, too. The music was so loud, our table of 6 all lost our voices or just stopped trying to communicate because we couldn't hear the person next to us or across the table from us. We had been warned, but as the night went on and on and on, the music seemed to get louder and the room got progressively darker. We are a bunch of 25-35 year olds, so it wasn't just our age that made us want to ask for a lower volume of music.  That was part of what ruined the night for me. The second part was that as half of the couple 'hosting' all the out of town guests, I felt somewhat responsible for making things go smoothly. Usually that is the job of the wait staff, no? On at least 4 occasions I had to either get up or assertively hail the waiter over to say things like, ""Can the 3 of us who have been sitting down for more than 10 minutes, but arrived later get menus?"" Or later on, ""We ordered bottled water, can you bring that now?""  or when the 7 item ceviche and tartar platter arrived, ""Can you explain which is which?"", followed by, ""Can the other half of the table also get a basket of bread?"" We didn't get asked if we wanted dessert, though there is a menu, because ~4 hours after our dinner started, I had to walk up to ask for the bill. (Our European guests were so jetlagged, we ended the night early.)  Perhaps we are old and don't like that new-fangled DJ music. Perhaps our waiter was on his first day of work. Perhaps the bar was over capacity and raw food takes longer to prepare than cooked stuff (though the 1/6 who ordered steak and didn't split the raw platter had to eat after we were all done!!!) Perhaps the cleaning lady quit that day and the lack of toilet paper in the women's restroom was her responsibility. Perhaps a million things conspired to make this one of the most uncomfortable evenings ever. I can't recommend this place unless you just want to sit at the bar, have drinks and maybe attempt to order the crab tartare, which was amazing, and you have 3 hours to kill waiting for it.Bill for 6 people, including 2 bottles of wine, was $50-60 per person."

Took my mother there for her bday with family (one of the vouchers was for a bday) and our waiter was so unbelievable uppity and rude. When we tried to pay the bill (after arguing about the voucher) he targeted my 62 year old mother and insisted that the voucher did not include his tip. In about 1 minute he said the word ""service"" or tip 18 times to her. He was so hung up on his tip that we couldn't get to the payment. Had he just said it once and let us pay (or even if he hadn't mentioned anything) he would have gotten a great tip - not because the service was good, just because we always tip at least 20%.
