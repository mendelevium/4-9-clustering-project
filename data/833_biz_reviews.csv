It was really delicious and exquisite experience. We were a huge group of 15 people.. I felt super worried about the service and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed but they delivered greatness! The ambiance was very intimate and small but still lots of tables around to enjoy They made sure that all of us didn't come home hungry! The menu is pretty awesome and lots of food options ! I wasn't in the mood for sushi but definitely changed my mind after I saw other people having it and my mood kicked in suddenly craving for sushi I enjoyed their miso soup it was amazing and delicious fresh just not much tofu so the dish itself was good just missing some tofu in my bowl! Seasoned great thoughMy husband and I decided to share The teriyaki chicken dish .. it was really great . Only thing was the Chicken was a bit dry but the tempura veggies and house salad definitely tasted fresh and amazing.The maki sushis was wonderful 5/5 16pieces pretty tender and very fresh. Thick pieces of avocado and salmon with high end grade sushi grade fish. pretty impressed!Overall the service was attentive and wonderful .. we got our food very quickly even though we were a lot in our group they were able to set up an ordering system into different groups so we could all order effectively.. seemed like it wasn't their first rodeo and are very well prepared for huge groups.Totally recommend this place in general and will be back for sure, their known for their sushi and are one of the best I've tasted in a while very much recommend it Cheers"

Less choices than in person but considering the circumstances, service is quick and efficient and we had a great meal! They were clean and gave us the order thru the window!"
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my fav neighbourhood sushi place. I go once every two weeks and I've never had a bad experience. Fish is always fresh, and the sushis always taste good. The fish selection is more elaborate than other small restaurants (squid, crab) and for the same price as other generic sushi restaurants, you get better tasting and fresher sushis. Def my go-to sushi place.Also, the sushi portions are very generous here."

Awesome!  And huge portions!  My cousin and his family come here all of the time and probably us. If we lived here, we would be coming all of the time too!"
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Kyoto is a hidden gem, that serves delicious fresh sushi.It's a very cozy Japanese restaurant, perfect for a date or even a family dinner. We took the maki combo for 2 people and added extra sushi rolls, which you can order à la carte. The portions are perfect, the prices are affordable and the wait time was decent for what we ordered and considering the restaurant was full. The sushi was delicious, and you can definitely taste the freshness of the ingredients.Extra tip: if you plan on coming during a Friday or Saturday evening, reserving ahead of time would be a good idea as the place can be full."

/user_details?userid=N-JmnZVOF7n71lRWoRFR2Q,Em N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been going there for years, and I could tell you with all sincerity it's one of the best authentic Sushi restaurants in Montreal. No Fancy fusions, only well balanced, well prepared, Japanese Sushi.The chef is the only one who makes the Sushi. He prepares each piece in such a meticulous and precise manner, which can take a little bit of patience when you're eagerly awaiting your meal. But waiting should never be an issue at Kyoto, knowing that the final result is nothing less than a skilful and masterly composed dish of perfection. So don't expect it to be done in 5 min.""Nothing but the best"". If they don't have it fresh they wont serve it. If a certain fish was out of season or simply not up to the chefs rigorous standards of freshness. It will be removed off the menu, and Although I might have been looking forward to that specific sort of Maki, I find comfort in knowing that ""Mr. Chef Kyoto"" only uses the best ingredients. Besides, variety isn't whats missing.I brought many friends to this place along the years and even if some of them disliked Sushi, or ran the other way at the thought of eating raw fish. This place has made it easy to make converts of all of them. they've all adopted Kyoto as a reference of what Sushi outside Japan should taste like. (NO More Kanda)The ambiance is exactly what I need when I want to have a relaxing meal with a few friends, or a romantic evening with my girlfriend enjoying some wonderful and artfully crafted Maki, Onigiri, Sashimi, Temaki, Karaage, Tempura...etc. Some Jazz playing in the background and a good Kieran Ichiban beer, what more can you ask for.I always feel welcome by Mrs. & Mr. Kyoto. Unfortunately I don't know their real names, and foolishly never thought to ask, but that never stopped their customary in synced greeting of Hello and Goodbye. Making you feel remembered and appreciated.FYI, I felt I needed to clarify what I read from other reviews. Despite what some people might think, you do not need to be Japanese to make great Sushi. I don't know if this misrepresentation of his ethnicity is an issue for the owner but I felt like I needed to stress this fact."

All the foods come fresh and prepared with great care.The owner of the restaurant, who is also the chief, demonstrates great passion in the art of making delicious food.The food is little bit pricey, but it definitely worth every cent spent!"

/user_details?userid=RQc1sODOsSL98gRaRUnuYA,Raegen S.,"Tulsa, OK",4 star rating,"Great sushi place. Very small place. The outside and inside are not the anything to write home about, but that doesn't matter once you try the sushi. The menu is basically soup, salad and sushi... So if you want more don't waste your time!All of the rolls we had were wonderful and the amount of fish in each roll was bigger than I have seen in years. They had very good flavors and selections. I loved the simple salad and the miso was not bad. If I am back in the area I would for sure go back. I would love to have a place like this down the street to hit up once a week. Do yourself a favor and try it."
/user_details?userid=-Qw088X2mCyxkAMov9Qqlw,Xochitl M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I'm a sushi lover and if you are too this is the place to go ! I always ask for the assorted plate for two people and three people can eat from it as the portions are generous. This is a family business so you know the service will be the best. One tip when you go there: don't go if you're starving because the service might be slow since there's only one chef. Still the wait is always worth it as the food is delicious !!
/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"This little gem in the heart of St-Laurent walking street is the bomb! I'm an avid sushi lover, have probably tried all the high end sushi places in Montreal so trust me when I say that this is the peak of price for quality.You won't find any fancy fusion rolls here or elaborate sauces, but if you love good quality sashimi this is the place.Everything was really fresh and the sashimi servings were very generous. Probably the biggest eel piece I've had in all of Montréal! The eel towered over the rice ball that held it up. Basic rolls also but well executed.Quiet and laid back atmosphere with serves well for a casual date or night out with friends.Only critic I have is that the service is tremendously slow ... It's a mom and pop joint and only the pop makes the sushi so be prepared to wait!If you want something to compare it to, it compares to yasu sushi in Brossard, but much closer to where I live :)"
/user_details?userid=7RcgjZLzBqEfTLAH6rQtRQ,Emmalee C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Once you've been to this restaurant you'll never want to go back to sushi buffets again (unless you have to for some group activity). The food is awesome, the service is wonderful (I've been there so many times that the staff recognizes me) and the place is very warm and welcoming filled with lovely Japanese decor. If you're a sushi lover, you definitely have to go to this place. It's like being in sushi heaven! P.S. I highly recommend the Sushi Pizza. It's not made like any other!"
/user_details?userid=1CTjTVO5YMKgDTLuYcQS1Q,JoJo C.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best sushi in all of Montreal the best food. Fresh sushi made the day of. Amazing service they are so polite and kind. The ice cream is homemade and delicious. The sashimi is delicious have never had anything so fresh in all of Montreal. Their menu can get $$ at night so if you can go for lunch its best they have combos that are not as $$ as dinner. They have a nice selection of sake and beer. I ave come back here many times and the service and quality of the food is amazing. I recommend you make a reservation on the weekends as it is a small home like feeling restaurant. And its worth the wait for the food.
/user_details?userid=yPyqydxdnHHQPNqdNDOZqQ,Victor R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"Clean, well appointed restaurant. Friendly service in both languages. We ordered the sushi combination plate. The food was of excellent quality and presentation. Our server was very busy handling the entire restaurant of more than 20 patrons by himself and he did a superb job. We look forward to our next visit."
/user_details?userid=LTmUmKEBTgSgZUUWtnDvCw,Dany K.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"I hope Kyoto means AMAZING in Japanese because this place served me the best sushi ive ever had. I got it to go, they told me to wait 15mins (gosh they had so many customers) but still finished early. The sushi was reasonably priced and OMG the portions were very generous. The staff was so friendly, needless to say i recommend this place for everyone!"
/user_details?userid=YwmebL4vwRbzFNMCVcl2PQ,Benjamin S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,This small unassuming sushi bar is very nice. Decor is on the basic side but the food is great. Nice salads and delicious rolls. Fish is very fresh and service friendly and efficient.
/user_details?userid=CvUWPa1LyVk-RyQC6dQ4gg,Victoria T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The salmon and the tuna on the sushi is very easy to eat. You can slurp them down and it melts in your mouth. The sushi is very fresh and prepared on the spot by the chef. Even though there can be a long wait for the sushi, it is worth it. The staff is very kind and friendly, and the service is very good. Thank you for this delicious experience! :)"

/user_details?userid=3O1KZlzdqlCKdE8DUNDzNw,Brian K.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place.  IMO, best price to quality ratio you can find.  We keep looking for other places to mix it up but we keep coming back to Kyoto because we're always disappointed with the other places that we find."
/user_details?userid=TBhrh-7I4TjDlJLVkW6YRA,L. T.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,I've been coming to this restaurant for a few years now and haven't been disappointed!

/user_details?userid=zR2RIA8HL2YoRwuwy-4E6g,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Overpriced below average Sushi. Sure..if you're comparing it with terrible buffet style ""sushi"" like Kanda's then yea..it's better.We tried different types of their Maki and sushi.I keep getting disappointed with the sushi in Montreal or near it and this is the most recent installment.Save your money and palate."
/user_details?userid=HPxLcTHZqhD6hRKVpSPGbg,Marguerite L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a very nice and calm restaurant, almost chic kind of, but you can still go there in casual with friends or your loved one. The staff there are great and the chef is awesome! In my opinion, the price isn't too high compared to some very high class restaurant."
