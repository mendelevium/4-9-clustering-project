/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friends and I headed out to Taverne Gaspar in Vieux Montreal as part of the Happening Gourmand restaurant promotion in the city. Set meals at set prices in higher end establishments. This restaurant was quite impressive inside. Set in one of Old Montreal's old stone buildings along the waterfront it had both an old and modern charm to it. Am impressive bar was set up along one of the long walls. The bartender caught a few of our eyes. Everyone was impressed by the setting. A+ for the interior. Noise levels increased over the evening as people drank and relaxed and a live band performed. The band, a trio of men with a front man, was excellent and not overwhelming. Their music choices were really good and we all got into them. A- for the noise level Service seemed quick and friendly. We ordered off the menu set for Happening Gourmand. I took the salad, mussels, fries and crème brûle. The salad was truly awesome in every way. A nice mix of greens and avocado with a light creamy dressing. Everyone who took it remarked on it. A+The mussels were good but not entirely to my liking. They were the small variety and I just wasn't use to the type of broth they were cooked in. I prefer a tomato based both for mussels while this more white onion and  just threw me off a bit.  By no means however were they bad overall. I'd recommend them if your ok with that style. B for the moules. The French fries however were not good.. not specifically the fries themselves which were nice, well cooked and looked somewhat more European that what we get here (a plus). Which is what I usually prefer. The problem is the chef or whoever prepared them put so much seasoning on them they ended up overwhelmingly salty. Too salty to finish in fact. My other friends had the same complaint and left theirs too. C- for the fries. In an unusual move for me I actually complained to two servers about the salt on the fries. One confirmed my complaint with my friends and apologized. To the other I mentioned salt should be something we choose to add or not since not everyone can eat salt or should have reduced salt. Her response was somewhat indignant and off putting suggesting that if I want to add to the food then I should maybe go somewhere else. She didn't actually say that but implied it with a shrug and and indifferent harrumph type remark. My friends were even taken aback. Neither of them offered any compensation. The second server could have handled the complaint better. D- for that incident. (If the 2nd server hadn't reacted as she did I'd give it a C)Coffee and desert were standard. A Dark & Stormy I had at the start was also standard ($12). B for the drinks. So it was a bit of a downward slide yet still we all like the place. The music was nice, the setting was sophisticated and the meal overall was generally good. If I had taken another choice in the main course I'd would likely be raving about it. I'd definitely give it another chance."
/user_details?userid=jqqB8hWF8kIrv2-qWt23xg,Kristen L.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Located in the hustle and bustle of Old Port, Taverne Gaspar is like a sports bar meets an upscale restaurant. There's a TV playing curling matches, an extensive full bar, and beautifully ornate architecture and furniture (they have mirrored ceilings). The fuyu sour is excellent - it is well-prepared and a nice eye-opener for brunch, if you're so inclined. Also phenomenal - the omelettes. I had the old Cheddar omelette, which came with some of the best potatoes I've had and buttered toast and fresh fruit. It was a hearty breakfast and well worth the price.The only rain on this parade was that the waitress was a bit disorganized and took a long time getting us our checks but otherwise, this place was exceptional and a must-try if you're in Old Port!"

The dish was ok, but I believe a poached egg should not have a hard center. I was surprised to only get one egg, and the one i did get was overcooked. Poached egg lovers beware."

Atmosphere was great, and not crowded, and the servers were friendly and good.  Started with a couple of cocktails, and both were good (La Germaine and Old Smoky), followed with lobster rolls (I thought these were just okay, but wife liked them), then entrees of crab cake burger (large and tasty) and steak and frites (honestly probably the best steak and frites I have ever had. Fries were perfect, and the steak had great freshness, flavor, super tender and delicious. Cooked perfectly.)Also had a large glass of the Gaspar lager, a nice full-bodied and grainy lager with delicate hints of hops... really enjoyed it (tasted more like a kolsch than a lager, but that's a-ok in my book.)We might be back! (Because I am curious about the duck poutine and the maple creme brulee)"

There's a waiter there named Dominic and he was absolutely helpful in every way. I ordered some mussels and fries - the food was pretty good, and with the sauce left at the bottom - Dominic gave me some bread to really scoop up the entirety of the meal. He even helped me out when I wanted to Shazam a song at the place - he was present, and he was helpful to all - we were a table of 20 people ! I also ordered a lemonade, great palate freshener."

We had an obsession while in Montreal to order all the charcuterie boards we could and this place did not disappoint. Unlike many others, we didn't have the choice of what our board came with, but we were not disappointed.I wasn't too impressed with their beer selection, but overall had a great experience!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice ambience, average food. Came here for their Happening gourmand special. I had the caesar salad, fish and chips and the maple crème brûlée. The salad was creamy and the bacon on it was good. The fish was bland even with the tartar sauce and the fries were a bit soggy. The creme brulee was very soft and the layer of burnt sugar was crispy. Overal the food is ok but tasted average. Basically a big meh. As for the ambience, it's an amazing place to hangout with friends or coworkers. They have a live band playing and singing and the decor was very cozy. The staff are nice and the service was quick. Considering the price of their food, I don't think I would come back for it."

I sat at the bar with a few friends early on a Sunday evening, and the bartender, Ludo, was incredible. He was attentive, told us about the menu, and was just generally a very likeable person. Everyone I was with immediately commented on how incredible the service was. We ordered a few drinks and then the duck confit poutine and the best of both worlds cheese and charcuterie plate. Everything was absolutely extraordinary. I would recommend this place solely for the incredible service and absolutely delicious poutine!"

Server was really friendly and gave us a tip to order food before the big group ordered. Glad she did!We both had the eggs Benedict duck confit. It was perfect! Runny eggs, good duck, crispy potatoes. $18 but worth it compared to other brunch places in the area."

The place was packed.  It was a very warm evening and the AC was not strong to keep the place cool. The waitress was very nice and smiley.The Grilled salmon was moist and tender on the inside, nicely grilled on the outside.   The Moule Frites was tasty and nicely seasoned.   The Mac n Cheese was one of the best I've had in a long time.Great selection of beers, cocktails and drinks.   Restaurant is inside the hotel, a bit hard to find if you don't look the right place if you come from St Paul.  If you come from the waterfront street, it's easy."

The people that work there are all really wonderful, the establishment really caters to customers, and the food is really great. Ambience is killer if you are looking for a lively upscale tavern dining experience. Their food is great, hearty, delicious. Burgers, Tartar, drinks are really great and beer is craft. One of my favorite places in Montreal, hands down."

The place itself is really nice, decor and ambiance and I must say the food was truly great!Around the table, 5 of us, everyone was more than happy with their choices: onion soups, salads, duck confit, beef mignonette, mussels.If you can go before February 9th, they have the #happening gourmand going on, which makes your diner affordable!Shutout to David and Dominic who made our evening so special!"
/user_details?userid=1_fwIUwAC5NEF3uhCXMaHg,David J.,"Baden, PA",4 star rating,"Our hotel restaurant, Taverne Gaspar, was our default choice for dinner, as we arrived too late to consider other options. It was a good decision. We had to wait at the bar until a table was available, but the wait came with a couple of pretty good martinis. Dinners were salads with chicken, which were good, but not notable, and much too large. The wine selections were excellent and very reasonably priced. The tavern atmosphere was energetic, dark, tightly packed, and loud. Overall, a good experience."
/user_details?userid=ggP5hWgIo6GyveBjeHIkNg,Brenda Jiwon L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3 star rating,"Came here for brunch with friends. We got the classic benedict with ham, which wasn't the best. It was simple, and the egg was over-cooked so the yolk wasn't runny. We also ordered the duck confit casserole, which was pretty good. The duck meat wasn't salty, and it went very well with the home fries potatoes and the bell peppers. The dish was a bit oily, but it went well with hot sauce. Overall, the brunch food is mediocre but we came mostly for the rustic and cozy atmosphere. Service is also pretty slow, so expect to wait at least 20-30 minutes for your food to come out."

/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for a second time during ""Happening Gourmand"" and found that the highlight was definitely the service.The deal was great, 27$ for a three-course meal. I ordered the Parsnip soup with roasted cauliflower as an appetizer, the Nordic shrimp risotto with grilled asparagus as a main and the Crème Brûlée for dessert.My boyfriend had the salad, the steak-frites and a chocolate tarte with strawberry. He also had a grapefruit cocktail which was light and refreshing.Overall, the food was relatively meh. The soup was average, nothing special. The risotto was pretty good. I didn't know that ""nordic shrimp"" were the tiny ones which I found a bit disappointing. It came out pretty cold but the waitress took it back and when it came back out, it was steaming hot and very yummy. It is really rich and filling so I took some to go.  The dessert was good. I liked the maple flavour of the crème brûlée, which made it unique.My partner's salad was delish. The mix of pear with the fried goat cheese and walnuts was an excellent combination. I have to admit, I may have eating half of it. Oops! He ordered the steak medium-rare but it came out rare. They apologized and fixed it up. The vegetables were underdone and the fries lacked flavour. He said the steak was really good and loved the sauce it came with. He enjoyed the dessert but I found it to be nothing special.It was unfortunate that we didn't get to enjoy our meals at the same time because mine took a while to come out. To apologize, the waitress gave us free shots and gave us his cocktail for free. We appreciated this.I think the highlight of this place is the service and atmosphere. Both times I've been here, I've had excellent servers. I think it is a great place for a date but also just for a drink with friends to watch the game. The menu is innovative and interesting but could be executed better.Food: 3/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Value: 5/5 for Happening Gourmand (3.5/5 otherwise)"

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Go for the fries and the fries alone. If you want a beer and great thin fries that are seasoned well, this is your spot. This is a fine place to people watch on the terasse overlooking the old port. The beer is also very good, but that is a credit to the people who brewed the beer and not to this establishment.The salmon tartare was bland. The maple curry almonds were soft and lacked freshness. The burger was tough as hell with a small rubbery patty. The bun was not especially fresh. Finally, my wife's lobster roll was made with meat that had clearly been frozen. Fresh lobster has a very specific texture and taste which was absent here. Also, the lobster meat was shredded into small unrecognizable strands. All the classic signs of a cost-cutting con job of a dish. If you don't have the setup or motivation to serve a proper lobster roll, take it off your menu! Stick to whatever it is you do well.I would only return for a drink."

Only got a good bright shot of the entrée, but it got dark quite quickly before our main came ‍ * Anywaysssss, the Charcuterie Platter * Quite large, great amount for 2 people. * Proscuitto had  mehhh good texture, the salami was flavourful, strong hint of cheese, the paté was not too salty, not to sweet. It balanced the bite well. * Loved the fruits, all the ideal flavours and texture you could hope for. But I wish they did provide more croutons. * 7.5 Gia points.  * The beef tartare did not really have a lot flavour, although the menu described it otherwise. It plainly tasted like beef as it is. In other words, it was pretty boring in mouth. Still not enough of the croutons * For $22.00, a bit pricey for what you get. * 6/10 Gia points  * Finally the lobster Mac n' cheese. Great textures, not a fan of  the cheese, but really enjoyed it. Love the different ways that the lobster was spread out. * 7.5/10 Gia points."

The soup was creamy and delicious with some hints of potato, carrot and butternut squash. The soup can come with bread too. The main course was mussels and fries. They give you a huge helping of mussels! Then dessert I chose the creme brulee d'erable. It was an interesting twist than I am familiar. The syrup is sweet. I think a regular creme brulee would have been better tasting but that's just my opinion. The atmosphere is very cosy and warm. I like the neighborhood and you can get a chance to walk some streets of Old Port on the way back to the metro!"

Our appetizer and drinks were served immediately. The appetizer was a main dish that we shared--moules frites. The mussels were cooked in beer, bacon, and onions. Delicious! The accompanying fries were soggy.It was downhill from there. We were ignored for an hour despite my husband going on a reconnaissance mission to recover our server but to avail. We asked a server in our vicinity to identify who would be serving us and he replied that they were working as a team. Heaven help them if they were competing for something! By this time, they lost us. Ironically, the restaurant has a two hour seating limit and they did not make their own rule one we could comply with. I am unable to comment on the rest of our meal because we lost our appetite amidst the misery of disorganization. Our Christmas dinner was not merry at all!"

While we waited, a group of about eight women came and sat behind us. They were given menus and water at once and their food was delivered before we even ordered.

Waiter insisted on not writing our order down, came back twice to confirm it, (each time getting one or more element wrong) (and we ordered straight from the menu, there were no special orders) but when we got our food each of us had something the other person should have gotten. After we all switched and passed different parts to the other person, then we were good. I had one of their signature drinks, which was good. Everything took a really long time to come despite there really not being anyone there. It's one of those places that was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I wouldn't go back, but I didn't hate it. I'd say it's probably better to come in the summer and order drinks."

For brunch I tried the cheese omelette and egg Benedict, both were on-par with what you would get at any chain breakfast restaurant (L'Oeufrier, etc.) except that those restaurants would serve you way faster than here.

Ambiance was nice,  a little noisy but we were a big group (and a noisy one at that) so the setting was perfect. I ordered from the $22 menu which offers you an appetizer,  main and dessert. I ordered (after a 30 min wait) the leak and potatoes soup (which took another 30 minutes to be served),  the ribs and fries (served with coleslaw and spicy mayo) with a vanilla mousse dessert. Needless to say,  I was underwhelmed. The soup was tiny,  lacked flavour and was lukewarm. The ribs were ok...nothing special. The fries,  though,  were great.

Started out with the mussels and fries to share. Amazing! We ate them like we had never seen food before - probably reenforcing all sorts of American stereotypes. The fries were so delicious that we ordered another batch. We then had salads - chicken and tuna. Both amazing. Please eat here. Also - we drank lots of wine, and the ambience outside was lovely.

/user_details?userid=1dT7DbBgvOmmD5OyvwYzjA,Catherine H.,"Detroit, MI",5 star rating,We enjoyed our meal here. It's not fast food and it wasn't fast. Having said that one should understand this is a relaxed environment and it is perfectly acceptable to spend two hours while dining. I wanted to try poutine while I was here and my first experience was not great so I gave it one more try here and I am glad I did. I ordered duck confit poutine and it was delicious.  If you are a fan of French fries you will like this dish. My husband ordered soup du jour and he said it tasted homemade and liked it very much. He also ordered lobster roll. He got two toasted rolls filled with a tasty lobster salad. If you order this in Montreal know that a lobster roll here is not a fried ball or cake. I ended with bread pudding and it was delicious.  Again it was not the expected compact lump of dried bread custard.  There was a delicious syrup on the bottom with a somewhat dense yellow cake baked on top of it. This reminded me of an upside down cake.  It was served warm with ice cream on top. The server was very nice but perhaps a bit stressed. When we return to Montreal we would certainly come back to enjoy a meal here.

Went for a Labour Day weekend, with my friends who also happened to be foodies like myself.As always - impeccable. Very informal, but fantastic service. My friends said it was one of the best meals they've had. Ever.Mussels are fantastic; seared scallops with celery root purée are to die for. Mac&cheese (we had a 7 year old with us) was amazing. Tartare -  still one of the best ones I ever had - right temperature, correct texture, awesome taste (the only better one I've tried is at Byblos in Toronto).Bottom line - I've been coming to Tavern Gaspar for years.

Our server was friendly and did a great job making sure we had what we needed. The cocktails were my favourite part - we tried the coco lemonade cocktail and the KO cocktail both refreshing and not too sweet !  The food is where it fell short for me . I had the duck confit& apple grilled cheese with side salad. The salad was okay can't really complain the greens were fresh and the salad dressing was good and they put the perfect amount of it. My issue was that the grilled cheese had more apple than duck and it made it taste so sweet it felt like a dessert and I barely tasted any duck or even cheese. My boyfriend ordered the ribs and fries and while the portion was big and the ribs were meaty they were drenched in a very sweet sauce which was too much sweetness and entirely took over the taste of the ribs (so maybe it would have be a good idea to ask for the sauce on the side). If I would come back here it would likely be to sit outside with some cocktails and maybe an appetizer since I was pretty disappointed with the meals."

The service was descent though. The menu could have offered more choices (comparatively) . I picked moules. The portion was standard but there was only one option for the sauce and it was not my favourite. They do not serve their own beer (this is not a negative per se but an interesting thing for me to explore) hence I ordered some amber belle gueule which I liked.The staff were nice and friendly. It is bar-noisy and not a baby friendly place I say.

For a last Candadian supper, I was going big before going home.Two glasses of rose, dozen oysters, mussels, frites and mac 'n' cheese later, we left stuffed and satisfied. Maybe with a tinge of indigestion too. As for the ambiance, it was a slow Sunday evening and we were one of maybe four tables seated within. Plenty of attention from our server without going overboard. It's a casual, yet chic environment. And yes, it's touristy, but I'd expect nothing less given the neighborhood."

As a starter we tried the Poutine - it was supposed to have some meat in it, I think - didn't see any. It was barely warm, cheese curds not melted - I mentioned this to the waiter and he simply said ""Noted"". The dish has potential though as the fries and sauce had good flavor.2 of us had the ribs - they tasted as though they had been boiled and then had some sauce painted on after the fact. They were very very fatty, though tender. Ribs were served on top of the fires which was a bit odd. Overall taste wasn't  great. Note to chef: Go to Baton Rouge, try their ribs and use this as a benchmark.One of us had the mussels - he referred to these as ""erasers in shells"" - they were warm, not hot, and the sauce was not to his liking (may just be a preference thing).Overall very disappointing - aside from the good beers and atmosphere.D"

We had risotto and Tartares which were incredible and we still talk about today. This was during the fall.This time around, we had a different experience. While the overall service is excellent as usual, we made a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday, and had to wait. We wanted a table outside and the wait line was really long. The service was very slow, over 2hours between the time we walked in and the time we left, considering we just had appetizers and one course. The drinks are still wonderful, and the food itself is still good, even if it seems to be greasier than usual. The ribs per my friends were OK, I had the duck confit panini which was good but very heavy/greasy and ended up taking half back home.

My lobster sliders were reminiscent of McDonald's lobster rolls: they tasted more like canned tuna than lobster. The sliders also came with gourmet chips, which were barbecue flavoured and good. The small salad on the side of the plate, like my sister's was also very oily. The service was extremely slow. There was one server for the entire front room and it was impossible to get a hold of her. We wanted to finish our meal with a cheese plate, but having such a hard time waving down the server and the food being mediocre to begin with, we decided to just get the bill and find somewhere else to grab a bite.Disappointed with this place, especially considering all the positive reviews.

To start, service was outstanding.  I can easily say I had the best waiter in my life! He was the kind of waiter that did it as a craft and not a job.  I even spoke to his manager to tell her how excellent our service was.  He was very attentive, informative, swift and friendly. Every dish was excellent except for the onion soup.  Think it was not salty enough, bitter from too much bread and missing flavor from not enough onions.  A gruyere cheese would have done the job nice but we had two sips and passed on it. I have eaten at restaurants in NYC during restaurant week and most of them are quite cheap in choices provided and portion.  At Tavern Gaspar, they just blew our minds by the huge portions they served even though it was prix fixe.  They are extremely generous in their portions and the quality is top, you can taste the freshness.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The start of the new year also means the start of Happening Gourmand in the old port. This food ""festival"" brings together all the restaurants of the Antonopoulos Group and provides a special reduced price table d'hôte at each of their 8 restaurants. Events like these are enjoyable for me simply because it allows me to try Old Port restaurants without costing me my arm and perhaps a leg to enjoy. Ironically this year, I wasn't a driving force amongst my friends to participate as is usually the case... two separate friends set up two reservations and invited me! I guess this is a sign of the event gaining a foothold in people's consciousness. Either way, I won't turn down a good meal so away I went. The first of the two dinners was at Taverne Gaspar - the Group's Gastropup located on de la Commune with a view of the Saint-Lawrence.Visually, Taverne Gaspar attempts to blend the pub or tavern look with elements of the old Montreal building it is located in - a nice long wooden bar with wooden seats, leather banquettes and chairs, tile flooring and roofing, low lighting with the exception of the christmas lights set up along the center of the room. That choice along with the use of dark tones elsewhere to put emphasis on the old stone walls creates a very relaxed old world kind of feel. The night we were there the entire street actually lost power so at one point for a bit, the lighting was almost completely candlelight so that intimate feel was cranked up further! Thankfully the lost power didn't affect our meal...Now, as for the food, the menu is definitely gastropub fare with touches of more local influences. As a group of 3, we each picked something different in order to try as much as we could. First up, a classic onion soup - a hardy and meaty broth with good quantity of onions nicely caramelized topped with gooey cheese and a crouton. Well very executed and enjoyable.I also had some fresh oysters because I'm a sucker of oysters so if they're on the menu, it's hard for me to resist. Paired with a nice mignonette, there were great.Next, we had the lobster sliders with house chips. Firstly, when the menu says sliders, we would have expected more than one but no... just one. Thankfully it was pretty flavourful although I would have prefer more lobster versus mayo. The house chips were nicely seasoned with a good crunch. The salad felt like it was there to make the dish seem larger. A solid dish flavour-wise but disappointing in terms of portion - especially when this was a dish where they charged extra for it within the table d'hôte.The last starter was their beef poutine with cheese curds and cipollini sauce. In my eyes, this was the best of the bunch. The beef was rich and fall apart in texture and in combination with the cipollini sauce, gave the poutine a much hefty feel than your standard poutine. Add solid fries and the correct cheese curds - melt just a bit but still keep its texture and squeak - and we have a great starter.Moving on the mains, the first one was their beef bourguignon. Once again great texture to the beef - chewy but fall apart. Carrots and potatoes cooked nicely as well but that reduced sauce was really the key here. Brought everything together and really made the dish nice and hearty - exactly what one seeks in a beef bourguignon.Next was the mac n'cheese with cheddar and smoked lardons. Baked off nicely in a onion soup dish, the cheddar brought some sharpness to the creamy gooeyness that is mac n'cheese and of course the fattiness of the lardons was well appreciated. A solid dish.The last main was the Gaspar BBQ burger with their house fries - another dish where they charged extra for but thankfully in this case it was worth it. Portion-wise this was by far the biggest and enjoyable across the board. More of the house fries plus a side of coleslaw to go with the burger. The beef patty was cooked perfectly topped with some melted cheese, bacon and slaw. A little spicy mayo was provided to go with the fries as well. Another solid dish to round off the second course.Finally, we had the desserts. The table d'hôte provided two options - chantilly brownies and a bumble berry cheesecake. The brownies were decadent and very chocolatey. The chantilly cream provided a nice counterbalance to that. The cheesecake was nice as well - the right level of creaminess without being too rich. Solid way to end our meal.Overall, Taverne Gaspar was a solid and well executed meal pretty much across the board. I'm not a big fan of how they charge extra on certain dishes within the table d'hote especially when they are some of the more appealing options there but I suppose it was just up to us to not order them. I like the vibe of the setting and the quality of the food on the menu. If one is seeking a worthwhile gastropub in Old Montreal, Gaspar is worth your consideration.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=goD_IMLQNEm8TrzpR_vtTg,Matthew P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Gastropub eh???   Frequented Gaspar for the Happening Gourmand thingy. We had to take a Res for 9 and even at that, the guy who took the Res didn't seem to mark it in the computer so we had the option of waiting for a table, running up a drink bill in their 'lounge' area(which I think is part of the gimmick) or eating at the bar. Jokes on you Tavern Gaspar and incompetent maitre d'...I love eating at the bar.     I stuck with the 'Gourmand' menu because I am not in the habit of lookin' a gift horse in the mouth. The Onion soup was serious, like Judge Judy serious. Molten cheese, bone marrow, beautifully caramelized onions...it is a meal in itself. No seriously, I ate like a third of it or I wouldn't have had room for my 'Tavern Burger'. In retrospect I should have finished the soup.   The burger came....and went. They were really busy so I am thinking the grill man got ahead of himself. When the burger finally came, it was fairly apparent it had been sitting on the pass for a little while....hot on top and lukewarm in the middle.   Allow me to say this, I don't send food back. When I go out to eat, as a cook myself and someone who has an unrelenting pursuit of perfection, a restaurant has one chance to get it right. If I send something back, I don't want another one. You've ruined my meal and I am not paying...it is kinda cut throat but I hold myself to the same standard...that is all I've got.   That being said, the burger was almost a send back. The burger was lukewarm and the piece of 'pork belly'(call it pork belly when you braise it, when it is on a burger it is called 'bacon' motherfuckers) had a very 'Birkenstockish' texture...but the onion rings were pretty good. My girlfriend had the roasted salmon on a bed of lentils which were both cooked to absolute perfection. Finally, the gateaux chomeur was very 'classic Quebec' and tasty...the flan...meh.   All and all, a middle of the road experience. The old fashioned I started with was great, our bartender was pleasant and the gourmand deal was OK but I wouldn't go back otherwise. Personally, callin' this place a Gastropub is like putting lipstick on  pig...another Quebec past time.Waka Waka"

Husband used Trip Advisor to find out what was open, within walking distance. Found Gaspar. Great looking place - dark wood and a homey feel while still being a touch upscale. The person greeting us was Charles, and he sat us by the window so we could enjoy looking out at the evening. Brought us 2 Broken 7 IPAs, in giant glasses that we were tempted to bring home with us. Delicious. My husband had the french onion soup, said it was one of the best he's ever had. He also had the duck confit grilled cheese, which was outstanding. I had  the tavern burger, done to perfection. Fries were way too salty so I only had a few and left the rest. Charles gave us space but was attentive, which I always like in a restaurant. I mentioned it was my birthday so he got shots for us and did one with us. Super sweet! My only complaint was the music volume. It was so loud we couldn't have a conversation with one another at our small table. I did however enjoy using Soundhound to find out what French language music I was hearing. I'd recommend for drinks and dinner, and if the lovely, tall, thin charming Charles is your waiter, you'll be well cared for."

And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.Gaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.Both times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.Second visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there.

The crowd was a mix of tourists and business folk. I suspect this place is more happening on the week-end. They might want to try a happy-hour drinks/food menu to draw in a more hip, local crowd during off-times.Do NOT order the ""popcorn"" sweetbreads. I was expecting substantial nuggets of hot, crispy-coated offal with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. What I got was luke-warm, flour-dusted bits of sweetbreads, with some droplets of sauce, drowning in too-large cuts of green onion as garnish... I expect to impart an Asian feeling? Mission not accomplished.The bartender, after giving great service the whole evening, asked what I had thought of them, and promptly took them off my bill after she received a resounding, ""Meh?"", even though I had ordered nothing else but tap water.In conclusion... Great service, good fancy-business ambiance, probably happening on the weekend, but don't use it as an opportunity to round out your Facebook Food List Challenge.PS. I really want to give this place 2 1/2 stars, but since there's no option it gets 3 'cause I'm nice :)"

The bartenders were quite busy but still very friendly, which was nice. We sat down and ordered some appetizers - I had the steak tartare with the poached quail's egg, which was delicious. My cousin had the pea soup, a dish that I'm not really a fan of in general, but I did try it and they made it well. For dinner we both had their special burger with pork belly and onions. This was very well done too, although it took a VERY long time to come, maybe 45 minutes.

/user_details?userid=zzgb9L3NBT9V8BGw_DcVYw,Belle D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Every January, the Antonopoulos group offers especially well-priced table d'hôte menus at its Old Port restaurants in hope of giving Montreal's winter go-out scene a facelift. The event - Happening Gourmand - also encourages people to try these restaurants in hopes of creating new patrons. This year, the event was particularly successful. Tables were booked early and the participating restaurants were buzzing during a month that usually leaves even the best spots high-and-dry. Wanting in on the deal, I decided to try Tavenre Gaspar, the groups' newest addition.I was excited to try this place. There had been an incredible buzz since its recent opening. We walked in, were greeted in a very friendly and welcoming way and brought to our table. The place is nice - stone walls, vintage art, wooden tables, chandeliers... A great alternative spot for watching the game, especially since it seems conducive to groups. And the music was fun - it included Interpol and Jace Everett (True Blood theme song). All great things.We all started with the onion soup. Great choice! It was one of the best I've had outside of Paris. The broth had a great consistency - not too thin and not too cluttered with onion pieces - with also the perfect amount of bread and cheese gratiné. Although it was described as a ""bone marrow onion soup"" on the menu, there wasn't very much bone marrow. However, considering how delicious it was, I really didn't mind. (Like, du tout.)The main dishes were hit and miss. I had the duck confit with fries and salad. The salad was good, nice and fresh. The fries were just ""there"" - they weren't particularly delicious or interesting. And the duck... It was... Ok. Tender on the inside, but somehow strangely fried on the outside? It almost had a breaded consistency?? I've had many duck confits throughout my foodie existence, and this was definitely the least exciting of them all. Strange, since the deliciousness of the dish essentially stems from the meat being cooked in its own fat... I didn't think such a simple and classic dish could be brought down to the level of ""meh"".My friends both had the Taverne burger with manchego and pork belly, accompanied by onion rings. The burgers were good - not too dry or overcooked - and the pork belly was a pleasant addition. The onion rings were nice and crispy and weren't too battered up. Cool.Time for dessert. I had the chocolate flan and unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan. Made with dark chocolate, it was made in the style of a flourless chocolate cake. Yet it was so crazy sweet that the whole point of making something with bitter dark chocolate was lost on me. It just tasted like under-baked regular cake.My friends both had the bread pudding - a comfort food classic. Again, just ok. And again, way too sweet. I know, we're taking about dessert here, right? But the ""bread"" was a sort of seriously saccharine version of a vanilla pound cake, and paired with caramel ice cream and thick caramel ""syrup"", it was too much. ADD in a bowl.There's one last thing I have to add: Gaspar has strange white lighting. It lines the walls and emanates from the chandeliers, and it takes away from both the tavern and dinner ambiance. Restaurants are supposed to create a sense of intimacy and make people look especially hot with their slightly dimmed ""yellow"" lighting. With relatively bright white lights all over the place, Gaspar doesn't allow for either of those and establishes a slightly awkward ambiance.So, is this a place for a nice dinner? All in all, Taverne Gaspar lacks a certain finesse. Yes, it's a tavern and it's not supposed to have the most innovative menu fine cuisine, but considering its owners, its location, its decor and its image, the food should be better. Currently, it's mediocre - not terrible but not delicious. Maybe the quality decreased due to the cheaper menu and rush of the Happening Gourmand event? Maybe Taverne Gaspar should be known for its house beer and specialty drinks rather than for its food? I don't know. But my experience won't have my 5-inch heels running back for more very soon... Unless it's for onion soup.Food 7/10, Atmosphere (mediumloud) 7.5/10, Pretty people 7.5/10, Music 9/10, Service 8/10.Pictures: belledenuitmontreal.com/…"

If I wanted to be picky I would complain that while the restaurant was nowhere near full and had many larger tables available up front, our ""reserved"" table was a tiny rectangle in back stuck to the staircase which appeared to lead to the downstairs kitchen. However, the 2 of us are on the small side, it was a very private spot, it was warmer in back and our waiter and food were so fantastic that we barely noticed the size of our table at the end!The menu and cocktail menu are not extensive but well thought out and easy to read.  They have different daily ""specials"" for each weekday. Not all of the menu choices were available and the Monday daily special had been replaced by a different option which our waiter took the time to point out and explain to us. We started off with the Mango Bellini cocktail - delicious!We shared the homemade chips with truffle dip - the portion was small but delicious and we were thankful it wasn't any bigger when we saw our main dishes! The homemade chips were thin, crispy waffles and the dip was tasty without being too rich or heavy. I had the tavern burger with manchego cheese and pork belly served with onion rings - it was a generous plate - delicious and very filling. My friend had the equally generous cornish hen served with french fries which smelled and apparently tasted just as good. Both plates were served with cole slaw - very fresh and tart. We had pudding chomeur for dessert - it hit the spot!Our waiter was fantatic - very attentive, took the time to explain the menu choices to us, offered us a variety of dipping sauces for the fries, checked up on us with a smile...in short, fantastic!Would definitely reccomend!"

As you go in, the walls are in brick and the feeling you get of the place is more of a relaxed pub for a happy hour after a long day at work. As for food, there was some interesting choices! I chose the onion soup with bone marrow; the soup itself was very sweet and they were not too generous on the bone marrow, only a small bit on the top of the cheese. Then I went ahead with the Tavern burger with manchego cheese, pork belly and onion rings.  The pork belly was much more like a slice of bacon and again they are not very generous in portion.  The burger was small and they included four onion rings.  I have to say that although there was not a lot of them, the rings were crispy and flavorful. Finally, a dark chocolate flan was included in the menu along with creme anglaise.  A flan in my dictionary is a custard-like dessert. It seems that according to them, it was a brownie! The brownie itself was powdery and not too visually appealing.Again, I will give them a second chance as I went during an event and they have not been opened for that long.  The service on the other hand was absolutely flawless!"

We came here on a quiet Tuesday evening and were told we would have 2 waiters and another waiter in training. Based on that, I thought we would have stellar service, but it was lacking. My husband and I like to try different beer, especially trying local brews. So we decided to try a sampler of 4 of their 10 offerings, only to find out that we did not get to pick which ones to try...really, never heard of that. The beer is nothing to rave about. We both had the Onion Soup which was recommended and I have to say that it was delicious. We were served our entrees right after finishing our soup. I don't understand why restaurants do this...it wasn't crowded and we were not in a rush. Anyway, my Macaroni and cheese was very good- it came out hot and the serving size was large. My husband ordered his steak medium rare and it came out VERY RARE, practically raw! The cut of meat was good and my husband ate it and hoped he wouldn't get sick (he didn't). I like my steak cooked rare and it was a little too rare for me. The fries were good. None of our servers came by to check on us until we were about half way through. We decided to share some Raspberry Sorbet  for dessert. It took 1/2 an hour to get to our table. Oops...we gave it to the wrong table and they ate it (free of charge). When I asked if we would have to pay, the waiter checked and told us it would be taken off our bill. It was delicious and there were 3 large scoops.

Just finished an amazing meal.  The charcuterie plate was big enough for4 (we were a table of 2), with a perfect mix of cheese,meat and vegetables. The salmon was absolutely perfect.  Mussels not as good but it is early in the season"

/user_details?userid=saBwAGVXwSk6kjryIDiNOQ,Matthew A.,"Westbrook, CT",4 star rating,"A modern gastropub that with an energetic vibe.  It is certainly in a touristy part of town, but is clearly one of the more authentic options if you are in Ville-Marie.  I had the Mac and Cheese with lardon which felt like a Roman Carbonara w/ cheddar cheese.  This is a very good thing.  The French Onion Soup was also a nice rendition.  Good service, cool place.  Look forward to coming back."

Located in Old Montreal, across the street from the waterfront, this location is perfect after a long day of sightseeing. Very rustic feel and look. I stopped by because I made a reservation for MTL à TABLE a few weeks prior, Montreal's restaurant week. The food was very good. For my first course I had the poutine, and this was by far the best poutine I had during my visit to Montreal (and the others I had were pretty good, which is saying something). The fries were crisp, and they did not overload the poutine with cheese (which is what I prefer). The poutine was topped with an almost brisket-like type of meat that melts in your mouth, and the gravy complimented it perfectly. For my second course, I had the macaroni and cheese, and this was nothing short of amazing as well. Must be one of the top mac and cheeses I have ever had. I believe there were six different type of cheeses baked to perfection, and all blended together perfectly. For dessert, we both had a brownie with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce which was pretty good. I am not a big dessert kind of person so I didn't really have a strong opinion on it. It certainly wasn't bad though. The wine and beer selection were pretty good, although I was not familiar with most of them because I am not from the country. The prices were a little steep ($18 for the mac and cheese!), so I am glad I came here for restaurant week, which was significantly cheaper. The service was very good, and our waiter helped answer any questions we had about the menu. I would definitely consider coming back here when I am in Montreal, and even though the prices are a little high, the food, atmosphere, and service is definitely worth the price."

This year I wanted to try something new, and enlisted the help of Yelp and some friends to find the perfect place. After looking at menus and consulting all recommendations given by friends, I settled on Taverne Gaspar because it combines three things I love - food and beer in a pub atmosphere. I made reservations for a Friday night at 7pm, and were seated promptly upon arrival. This place finds itself in Old Montreal and is very quaint. It is minimalist and offers a laid-back feel. Our server, Eric, was super nice and was very knowledgeable on the specials and beer/food selection. Danny and I each started off with the beer dégustation (5oz each of a dark ale, cream ale, white ale and blonde ale), which ended up being the perfect choice as I had been undecided on what beer to choose. Being Oktoberfest, we were suggested fresh pretzels as appetizers, which we both had. They were fresh and so good with the marinara sauce. For our actual meals, I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries, and Danny had the Steak Frites. My burger was so tasty, flavourful and not so ginormous that I couldn't finish the rest of my meal. The BBQ sauce on it was just perfect, and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Danny enjoyed his steak and finished up my sweet potato fries as well (sign of a good meal!). At the end of the meal, I was surprised with a birthday dessert, a chocolate molten lava cake with fresh raspberries. It was the perfect end to a delicious meal. Definitely recommend others give it a try!"

The service was good, but since it was a Monday night, and not very busy this might not be a good indicator of service on busy night. Also more expensive than the $$ would indicate to me. Loved the decor."
/user_details?userid=XbbHlL0kIsXnFORTI9sqbg,Alicia T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Great spot. Some of the portions sizes were itty-bitty (ie-appetizers). The ""cheese platter"" had four slices of cheese, which was rather annoying. On the upside, the stead tartar was scrumptious, as were the burgers and the ribs. The place is cozy and warm and chic in a woody, stony, wrought iron-way. Initially, the music was too loud for my Dad so my sister asked them to turn it down...and they did--God bless 'em. The service was fantastic as well."

/user_details?userid=gwjjJZUZk620EMp5owPmNQ,Samantha A.,"La Jolla, CA",1 star rating,"Another tourist trap! Junky chips and guacamole that were so plain. Our kids fish and chips was mostly batter with tough chewy fish on a bed of smushed cold fries. They didn't bring our food and when we finally asked the waiter claimed are you ready for your second service? So after almost an hour you want to just now put in our order for our dinner??? Apparently he said this is how it is done in Montreal. It was not our experience anywhere else in Montreal but apparently in this place it is the case. We left tired, offended, having eaten a few fries and missed out on the old port activities with the time we wasted waiting for our food. To top it all off instead of an apology we get a backhanded comment that we'll just throw the food away. Staff is rude, food is like cheap, sub-par bar food, and wait and prices are ridiculous. 40 bucks for that nasty fish and chips and a plate of store bought chips with a small cup of guacamole. No thank you!"
