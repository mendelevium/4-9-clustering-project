Taste is extremely authentic!! We usually order the same Steamed Beef Coriander & Chicken dumplings!! The sauces make the experience even better! The servers are all super helpful, friendly and patient!! Prices are very low for the quality and taste of the dumplings!! We are regulars and eat here very often!"

Noodles are home made but extraordinarily greasy, there was a large pool of grease under my noodles, hands, everything when I was done, which isn't a particularly pleasant experience. The taste was also 'fine' but not special. And generally everything is just more 'fine' than good, and for the area it is in you are paying full price too, but then it doesn't feel worth it at the end of the day."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a cute little spot for dumplings on mont royal. the location is large and clean and the staff is friendly. Lots of seating inside (no outdoor seating though). They accept credit debit and cash. The prices are fair as well for the amount of food and quality you are getting. We ordered the pork buns , fried shrimp&pork dumplings and the lamb &coriander dumplings steamed. Â The pork buns were ok , not much pork inside the filling was mostly an overly sweet sauce and the dough didn't have the right texture way too bread-like (I love pork buns but I didn't really enjoy this). The shrimp&pork fried dumplings were to die for , so juicy fresh and full of flavour (a must order on their menu), the lamb and coriander was pretty good as well just lacked a touch of flavour. They had a lot of choice of dumplings and appetizers. A really good place to curb your dumpling cravings !"

Price is fair for the amount of dumplings you get but the taste isn't all that amazing. The sauce was missing ginger and they didn't have the soup dumplings. I had the shrimp, pork, and chive dumplings and my husband had the beef and coriander dumplings. Cute place and awesome location but the food could be way better! Also service was pretty slow which was surprising since our order wasn't very complicated and the place was almost empty."

/user_details?userid=qlBgs_vRwXoSJSSoj2oecQ,Sach B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Four stars because the food is good and prices very fair. I want them to succeed! Definitely worth a try...A little hidden gem. Yum.
/user_details?userid=Mk9nu863A2W50UcCKdeLiw,Matt D.,"Surrey, Canada",1 star rating,Service was not good. We walked out because we were not served. We saw 3 pairs of people coming in after us and they were seated and served before we even put in our order. I did notice that there were only 2 servers and they seemed to be lost.
