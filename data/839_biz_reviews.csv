/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you live in Pointe-Saint-Charles, you come here for (mostly) one reason: reasonable and quick food at an amazingly low price point. Basically: you get legit Chinese food that will fill you up for 5 bucks. 5 bucks - feels like the pricing I remember from my college days (and I've been a university PROFESSOR for a long time now... so I'm referring to the late 90s/early 00s). The food is solid so let me assure you that you get a very good deal here.The owner is quiet but very nice. I love that he has pictures of his past hanging in the walls (his life in Asia, his past involvement with martial arts, etc.). To me, it means something to see a personal side of the business you support.One caveat: the place doesn't look ""spic and span clean"". This doesn't bother me too much because I always get take out. I have NEVER had cleanliness or health issues with the food. NEVER ONCE. In essence: the place isn't beautifully maintained and that allows the owner to earn a livable wage/profit despite his borderline incredible pricing. Basic economics I think."
/user_details?userid=ZHQA0aJXjAZd9Ey1w3V8Sw,Coco C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great food, unbelievably affordable prices. The menu consists of pictures on the wall and the dishes are 5$ each, taxes included. The owners are pleasant, speaking broken franglais. I had the Pad Saw and my mother the Pad Thai combo with spring roll, nicely fragranced won ton soup and a cold soft drink (7$ for the combo). Everything was fresh and tasty and served in no time. There are two half booths available for seating, so a total of four places.Looking forward trying the Tom Yum soup and their homemade dumplings.Wouldn't recommend the General Tao chicken which is too heavy on the ketchup."

H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This little place in the heart of Pointe Saint Charles defines the term hole in the wall and I use this term in the most positive way. This little takeout counter offers and incredible price to quality ratio, this is why I think it deserves four stars. Where else can you find a generous portion of home made Pad Thai for only five dollars or even a combo plate for only seven dollars. I haven't tried them but the soup dumpling are suppose to very good as wellThis place is really a take out counter even if it has a few booths for you to eat in, this really isn't a place you want to eat. Don't get me wrong the kitchen is clean and the owner is a wonderful cook but this old depanneur was never meant to be a restaurant and the wooden benches don't look that comfortable.If you're looking for a good neighbourhood Asian take out place give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."

All the food that I have tried here is awesome and fresh. If you are a broke student, this place is heaven. Each dish is very very reasonably priced at $5 and, given the quality of the food, it really is a bargain. As others have already mentioned, this is a takeout place. The interiors might be intimidating at first but do no justice to the food that is served. I was apprehensive at first but now am a changed man. Do give this place a try. You won't regret it."

I moved here and I always thought this place was abandoned, until one day I saw a sign!! 5$ menu, brought to you by someone who clearly doesn't speak French or English. You must point at the menu board, he will not start cooking until you pay first!Whatever you point to you wont be disappointed, the food is great. Try it you won't be disappointed."

/user_details?userid=MAnxtA80ZCOHsQVn70KFeg,Kim D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very quick for take out. cheap too for the food. I'll definitely be going back. Previous comments were useful and I agree with them too.
