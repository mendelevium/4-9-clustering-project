The decor is very cute and the wait staff is very kind and accommodating!Their menu offers a variety of twists on a classic dish for those that are more adventurous and they also have your classic eggs, bacon and toast for those who don't. They were quick to modify the dishes as well for any dietary restrictions without a fuss or charge. They offer cocktails which we didn't try but looked very good from the table next to us. Also very affordable breakfast and good portion sizes! It's really a Verdun gem!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: Wellington and 1st Avenue. Street parking is available but it's a question of luck. Verdun station is a short walk away so you can always take the metro over.The place: Small with a dozen tables or so and some bar type seating. I showed up around 1:45 so grabbed a bar seat but was able to take a table when some people left. This is obviously a fav' with the locals because the place was still full at that time and I frequently saw folks coming in to order coffee for takeaway. Also, they play CCR. That alone means I'll be coming back.The goods: the menu is small but you'll likely find something you'll like. I decided to get ricotta pancakes with bacon. DAMN that was a lot of food! The pancakes were perfect and not drenched in maple syrup - perfect balance of salty bacon and sweet maple syrup. There were also some potatoes and a fried egg for good measure. I enjoyed this dish very much - my only negative was some of the bacon bits were pretty hard while others were perfect. Not sure if I got leftover bacon mixed in with fresh stuff.Service: Super friendly!Price point: A bit steep at $16.This is a great neighbourhood spot!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",2 star rating,"The lineup at Janine Cafe was too long so we decided to try Well instead. This was a terrible mistake. Overall, service was absolutely bare minimum (took our order and then disappeared), and the wait time was unreasonably protracted. To add insult to injury, the food was cold and mediocre when it finally came. We were seated at 12:10pm. I ordered a cappuccino and an edamame toast with gravlax salmon and a poached egg. My coffee came at 12:20pm and then my food came at 1:00pm, 40 minutes later. I admit, the presentation of the meal was good. However, it was really cold. I might be wrong but it felt like the dish was prepared but left to collect dust for 20-30 minutes, and thus got cold. Every piece of vegetable was icy cold. Those two white pieces of broccoli (on the photo) were so cold. Even the poached egg was frosty. My apologies if the dish is meant to be served cold, but I did not enjoy it. I couldn't wait to pay my bill and just leave, and even that took more time than necessary. Two stars, on account of the beautiful presentation of the food. My eyes, at least, were well nourished."

My husband and I took Uber from our hotel downtown to this place and it was honestly quite a ride (about 25-30 minutes) but it was absolutely worth it! I ordered Pancake Ricotta Bacon while my husband ordered Pancake Yogurt and Fruits. Then we both ordered latte. I really loved my pancakes! They were really soft and super tasty (my small complain is probably the food took pretty long to cook). I was pretty skeptical at first whether I should try this one because of ricotta but turned out it tasted pretty great because it being one of the ingredients! I got to try a bite of my husband's pancakes as well and his was pretty great, too! The place also looks very nice and instagram-able ;)"

Service was good, we were served quick and they made sure eveything was good throughout the meal. Their latte was good, strong coffee! I tried their ricotta's pancakes with bacon. It was good but not more. Also had their breakfast poutine, pretty normal too.No line up! It was actually pretty empty for a saturday... maybe its not known yet!Friendly atmosphere!"

They stayed opened for us after hours for this event and they were very attentive to our needs.I found that some bites were a bit salty but overall, really good!I definitely recommend brunching here!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited restaurant Well for a ""foodies"" brunch event. I sampled every dish on their menu and 2 dishes prepared specially for us. Though there are a few minor things, I'd change, my experience overall was great!First of all, this restaurant has some of the tastiest pancakes in this city. I tried 3 pancakes dishes, all of them were fantastic, but my favourite was the sweet and savoury, Ricotta Maple Bacon with a sunny side up Egg. Another notable dish was the breakfast poutine! My goodness, this dish is a must try. It's made of spicy Veal stock, Chicken (the dish comes with ham or bacon but you can sub for chicken), Potatoes and a sunny side up Egg. It was perfectly balanced with the right amount of flavour. The best part is that I didn't feel gross after eating - like I do after most poutines.Sadly, a few of the dishes were a little salty (e.g. Feta + Herbs scrambled eggs). They were definitely still good, edible dishes, however I'd pull back on the salt.The staff were all very friendly and provided great service. The restaurant is small, but very cute. Also, the lighting is phenomenal for those foodies that snap pictures of everything!"
/user_details?userid=JAd_smZwostihQySzkgn5g,Ghyslene L.,"Anjou, Canada",5 star rating,The best brunch place in Verdun! The service was fast and impeccable. The restaurant is small but very intimate which is perfect for a date or for a one on one meeting.I'll surely come back soon
/user_details?userid=T6OT8oqqQyFHhs7VOqk3pQ,Pascal S.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant is a hidden gem for any foody or anyone looking for a great breakfast, with great quality dishes and service. The restaurant is quite small so it is not ideal for large groups, but it has a nice atmosphere and design and friendly staff.The ricotta maple bacon pancakes are bursting with flavour and are a must-try! Definitely the best pancakes I have had in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hip breakfast/brunch place in Verdun that played hip hop when we got in. Hipster??? Well (duh) yes. Not that I have anything against hipsters lol! The service was very good and the vibe quite casual. Another good addition to the area. I got the classic 2 eggs and ham with potatoes and toasts. Hubby got the breakfast sandwich which he really enjoyed. I would of given this place a 4 stars but they gave me burnt toasts (very burnt). The toasts were placed in a strategic position so that I wouldn't notice it at first. The better side of it was up. I didn't wanted to make a fuss but hubby insisted on having the problem fixed which they gladly gave me another toast still a bit burnt but better then the first try. Prices are a bit higher then the usual breakfast place but ingredients are better also. They make their own bread too. But other then that, the food was good and service as well."

/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Instagrammer foodie Myum, had a meet and eat brunch for Montreal foodies at the restaurant Well in Verdun. This place is a gem. I never knew about this restaurant. Outside, there are thrift stores, and few shops. So the resto's surroundings aren't attractive therefore I would have not notice this place. Thank you to Myum, I was introduced to this treasure. It was a blast to meet our Montreal foodies! We arrived at 2:30 pm, but we were served at 3:40 pm. I was dying of hunger. When we were presented by our first dish, I was mesmerized by its beauty and its colors. It was a Vegan plate called Fungo.... it was delightful. Then we had edamame Toast with salmon and poached egg. I think that a best breakfast dish I ever had in my life. There were more dishes with meat, which I didn't try since I am vegetarian, but the presentation was breathtaking. Resto is average looking. The service is long but you cannot rush the perfection. Our server was a sweetheart. The dishes were so pretty as it was being presented to royalty. The taste of each dish was beyond succulent. Definitely... I need to come back, and I highly recommend this magical restaurant."
/user_details?userid=Xlqxirfs1rZogrv2tukNqw,Jane L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"The food here was great and the ambiance was very cute! The reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because the service is painfully slow and rap music was blasting the whole breakfast. Otherwise, this is the best brunch place in Verdun - it was my second time here and I'm sure I'll come again :)"
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"New brunch spot in Verdun!Has the old usuals like bacon and eggs and home fries but also offers unique upscale twists like bone marrow with eggs, fried chicken sandwich with avocado and a fried egg on top (called the Pablo) , ricotta pancakes with bacon, bacon (or pulled pork) and eggs breakfast poutine, smoothies and a few alcoholic beverages. I had the Pablo and struggled to finish it, portions are very generous here. You don't have to eat for the rest of the day. The people who run the place are young and enthusiastic. The space is a narrow breakfast bar with additional tables against the wall. The place was packed when I walked in at 1pm and it's been barely open for a week! Bit of a hipster vibe, I saw a few man buns on display but given that Verdun has been undergoing gentrification and hipsters and other folks have been leaving the Mile End and the Plateau to come to Verdun, it's not surprising. Another win for Verdun!"
/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My friend and I walked in around noon on a Sunday. As expected, the place was packed. We waited less than 10 minutes and we were seated at the bar. I ordered a latte and my friend an espresso, which were served quickly, our food arrived only a few minutes after. We both chose the poutine, his with bacon and mine with fried chicken (extra $2). I have to say it is the best breakfast poutine I ever had. The extra is worth it for the fried chicken, it was extra crispy and tender. Sauce was a spicy veal fond type. My only complaint was that the sauce was too salty. I advise the waitress after my meal and she kindly said that she would advise the chef. The service was awesome and quick. It is clear that these individuals have a great relationship with one another. We could witness everyone running around and handling everything in team. I will have to go back and try plates I saw coming out of the kitchen."

/user_details?userid=LVwUcb918a9biz-1ajlEGA,Karen H.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,Great brunch spot. Seated right away and 3 of us ordered 3 different plates and one was as good as the next. Recommended.
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's rare that I eat in Verdun, since it's quite inconvenient for me to do the traveling, but I have heard so many good things about Well that I decided to pay a visit. Usually it's quite crowded, even during the week, because people would go to this place just to take pictures since it's a really instagrammable restaurant with houseplants and beautiful decor. I was super lucky to go there on a Tuesday and I was enjoying my food super quietly. I took the dish recommended by the staff: il Fungo (mushroom, nuts and tofu on arancini), it was super flavourful and well-balanced! It might sound funky and exotic but the taste was wow, and the price very fair. I love the place and the service, would definitely recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=KrptDrkT8sh-hSBMqXciJA,Stephanie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm living close of this new Verdun gem and I'm very happy about that. So far I've tried three of their dishes and they've been very filling and excellent. The breakfast poutine was a discovery. The 'fond de veau' sauce was very tasty and melded all the ingredients together ; braised ham, an egg (usually sunny side up but you can ask to cook it however you want), perfectly cooked bacon and of course, potatoes and cheese under all that goodness. It's a big portion, but that's ok, you can bring back the rest home (I encourage you too, if you got a toaster oven, it heats very well).The cassoulet also is the same way. Immensely tasty with braised ham and an egg on top. Accompanied with two pieces of toast. It may look small but it's oh so filling. That time I eat the entire thing.  (So good, almost no remorse!)Last thing I ate was the bacon pankake. I chose it to eat light but coudn't stop myself from finishing the whole thing. (Oups) The two thick but fluffy pancakes were the bread of a ricotta sandwich. With bacon and maple syrup. Had every for hours after eating that dish :) Gotta go back soon to try the rest of their menu... there's a toast edamame with my name on it...."

Two of us had the herb eggs, one friend got the breakfast poutine. I'll be trying to figure out how to make the herb and feta scrambled eggs when I get home next week...Chill relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=9khIcB539VbbcVD6yQAwIA,Al G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Pancakes in Verdun. The spices they have on the potatoes are incredible, I love bold flavour! Good coffee, friendly staff.Cute, cozy place, (not big enough for big groups)."
/user_details?userid=vJVWP-6RuLtmwatFzpbuBw,G S.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Foodwise, it was great. My friend and I shared the bacon pancake and the fruit pancake. Size of dishes is generous. As for the rest of the menu,  variety seems reasonable. Also had a latte bowl. Quality of the coffee is good. BUT, there is no filtre coffee, which is pretty odd for a brunch place but tolerable. The biggest issue here was the staff. Friendly, yes. Efficient, yes. Professional, not so much. As we were sitting at the bar, staff was eating behind the bar. At one point, this young girl was having her breakfast right in front of me. Come on guys... More over, some of them were on their phone in client's face.... a big no. If there was a manager on the floor, he or she wasn't sharp enough to see these obvious professionalism errors. Not unfixable, but needs some polish."
/user_details?userid=P6VsfBpFjRA9XcpOVE4r5w,Valérie V.,"Kirkland, Canada",4 star rating,THE WELL WAS AMAZING!!! I had the classic bacon and eggs breakfast- totally worth it! The bacon was thick and out of this world DELICIOUS!! Cannot wait to go back and try their more original dishes! Staff was great and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. I had an americano with my meal. The reason why I took off 1 star is because my husband and I like a good filter coffee with our breakfast. We were disapointed that only specialty coffees are available. Please add filter coffee to your menu!!! It would be amazing!! We will be back regardless though
