So much so to say about it that I don't even know where to start!!!We came on time for our reservation but our seats at the counter wasn't ready so they seated us on a small table next to the bar. The chef came not too long after to talk to us and he was such a pleasant chef! He took time to suggest us some drinks that we might like while we waited. Once seated, the magic begun. EVERYTHING was delicious! The menu consist of local ingredients so you will not find black pepper or citrus in any dishes, for example. The attention that the crew puts on every single dish that leaves the kitchen is amazing! The menu changes every month (or about). It follows the seasons and what local producers have. I believe this restaurant is a must on your list. I WILL COME BACK VERY SOON!"
/user_details?userid=nRr7V_o9YjXeCWd62mJn2A,anabela D.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,A must visit if you are in Montreal!!If they upped service and ambiance it would be close to a five star option Entrance is a bit hard to find but look for the corrugated tin roof open porch  One of the best and original  tasting menus I have had in sometime Very vegetable forward with a dab of animal protein and meats  And yet I left full and satisfied Expert purveyors of umami  Ambience is homey country$58 IMO is a bargain for  4 courses at this level Did not do the wine pairing but might try my   next visit Service was adequate Wine list good amount of options although veering towards pricey  Favorite dish of the night was the grilled brussels  with apples puffed rice bee pollen -amazing Highly recommend!

I had heard mumbles that Candide was amazing and those mumbles were right!Finding the place was a little tough for a navigation-challenged person like me, but with perseverance we discovered the restaurant was actually the back part of the looming church.The fifty-five dollar four-course meal was an absolute steal.We started off with a quarter-dozen oysters ($3.5 extra per oyster) flavoured with horseradish which were delicious. Not so much heat that your sinuses rebel but enough to wake up your senses.These were followed by juicy little grape tomatoes that had been delicately brined and served with a sort of Spätzle and jus. Again, yum.More veg was brought over, this time Endives and Oyster mushrooms garlicked to perfection. Fabulous!And then this is where we separated. The men had the lamb - served with borlotti (noodles) and a type of home-made buttermilk cheese. The slow roasted lamb fell off the fork, the sauce rich and glistening, and the cheese helped keep all the flavours in harmony.The ladies on the other hand had the trout with squash and bayleaf oil. Sadly they both reported the fish as being overcooked and dry. Desert, for the men, was a squishy serving of runny brebichon cheese that was paired with a quince and onion chutney. We both reveled in the unctuous delight of this amazing Quebec cheese. The ladies both had the strawberries with malted wheat and raspberries. There was glee in their eyes as the plates were placed before them.All in all it was a perfect meal for the lads, but a bit of a miss for the lasses."

The chef's table is the only way to go in my opinion.the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely welcoming. This downtown eatery is literally a hidden gem. The chef was very attentive and willing to answer my many questions while I interrogated him about the unique and innovated dishes. This place takes on the vibe of other tasting menu restaurants like Catbird Seat, Bastion and Cho Lon, in the U.S., but at a very reasonable price. This is a must visit in Montreal...right up there with Bouillon Bilk and Au Pied Cochon."

My boyfriend and I saved this for our last night in Montreal. We walked in for our 8:30 reservation and you can immediately feel the warm and inviting atmosphere. It's a gorgeous room with an open kitchen. All the staff, from the hostess, to the servers, to the sommelier, and of course the chef, were absolutely amazing. Now let's get to the food. Every dish we had was better than the last. This review will be too long if I review every single one but I will say we were fortunate to try their greasy beans dish which was fantastic, and their hen of the woods dish which was our favorite. The meal was finished off with the chef coming to our table with fresh honey comb and letting us have a small taste with our aperitifs. Just incredible from start to finish. I'd also love to point out that we did the food and wine pairing and so happy we did because the drink pairings were amazing. The sommelier was so knowledgeable and did such a great job describing the origin of the wines and the tasting notes it just made the meal that much better. I can't say enough great things. We can't wait to be back in the summer to try their summer tasting!"
/user_details?userid=P6S7G1dex1QIhWntV_f0IQ,Cecilia D.,"West Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"We had a wonderful dinner here our first night in Montreal. And you can see the pride and love they have for Canadian cuisine and local produce. Yes, it's hard to find but they were kind enough to call us a few hours before our rezzie to let us know exactly where to go (behind the big church in what seems like a very residential neighborhood). The tasting menu was superb but what brought it over the top for us were the thoughtful wine pairings. Their young enthusiastic sommelier will go over each of her choices and why she chose it. For example, the sturgeon with the ""orange"" wine was genius. No, this is not a place for picky, everything-must-be-on-the-side eaters. You must be prepared to eat things like muscles with yogurt (delish by the way) or sea snails with pickles. If you are a true foodie, you will appreciate the truly innovative combinations. And the space is lovely, all industrial with an open kitchen. We're thrilled we came here and the cheese stuffed squash blossom is why I exist. Have it in place of the (delicious) dessert and it will change your mind about how to conclude a fine dinner."

Show up and put yourself in the hands of the ever capable staff of Candide and let them wow you course after course. The tasting menu changes monthly depending on what is in season. We had a group of 6 and everyone was blown away by the knowledgeable staff and the absolutely fantastic food! This is fresh, forward thinking cooking at its best. This is a memorable dining experience for all the right reasons. Can't wait to return!"

We felt welcomed from the moment we walked in and were greeted by the team. Cliche-ic but the place gave us a welcome-back-home type of feeling. Explanation of each wine pairing was clear and enthusiastic. The courses came all at once for all members of the party, with the kitchen staff coming out and rotating on each course to explain the ingredients. They all knew their stuff well. Very professional."

A trio of foodie New Yorkers embarking on good Montreal food can be in occasion, difficult to please. Genuinely well thought out meal that was cooked to perfection. I have no complaints and was pleasantly full after the meal. The honey tasting at the end made me feel like I was walking through a farm. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=y52KhfFDFThNe2olZ976zg,Jane K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"What an experience.  Felt very lucky to have found and booked this restaurant.  They do a tasting menu and when I was there(July)we sat out on their lovely terrace.  The food was delicious and well proportioned.  The service was great and it was nice to see the chef owner there as well.  I can imagine this place is super cozy in the winter.  The trek to find the restaurant was half the fun.  My BF thought I was definitely leading him in the wrong direction but when we found the restaurant, we both were delightfully surprised.  Wish we did the wine pairing but we were hungover from our first night in Montreal.  They have a great selection of natural wines.  I mean there are so many great places to eat and drink, four nights did not do the city justice.   Candide was definitely one of the best meals we've had in a long time.  Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=PJEMuHRRfpLe1Vbc6biCjg,Robert C.,"Spring, TX",5 star rating,"Incredible dining experience!  The chef's ""farm to table"" approach really showcases the unique flavors that are found within the region.Our party of 4 went for the tasting menu with wine pairing, HIGHLY recommended.  The sommelier was extremely knowledgeable about all the wines that she picked to pair with the dishes.For the fall tasting menu, go for the mushrooms!  Chicken of the wood...I've never had a mushroom that had such a texture and taste as this one.  The fragrances from the dish were mesmerizing, and the Italian wine to pair with it was consumed with each bite...such a harmonious pairing.Bleu d'Elizabeth as a mousse for dessert with lignonberries, sweet potato two ways, and paired with a Pedro Ximenez sherry, quite memorable indeed!I'm already planning a trip back for next Spring, excited to see what will be on the menu!  Also, the price point for the entire experience...there's extreme value here, if you look at tastebud satisfaction and having your senses ensnared as a function of money spent, make your reservations immediately!"
/user_details?userid=xAa8tI6Afx11hm4prMDKtQ,Ben Q.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We went to Candide for our anniversary because we didn't want to be disappointed by a pretentious fine dining restaurant. At first, the ambiance was promising with dim lighting and acres of wooden accents. We joked that perhaps we should come every year since it was so cosy. Unfortunately, the food served was incredibly disappointing and we left almost incredulous. Firstly, the server seemed to struggle to remember what the dishes on the fixed menu were, but was clearly cocky about using ""alternative seasonings"" due to their locavore mission. The first appetizer combined potato purée, peas and ham with a strongly meaty sauce. The peas were crunchy, but not in an ""al dente"" way, just undercooked. The second appetizer was the only dish we enjoyed, the parsnip pieces popping under a buttery sauce of bottarga and capers with fresh, floral basil on top. Both appetizers leant themselves well to the soft fresh bread, though it was too salty to eat much of and no butter was served. For mains, the lamb cooked over coals was supple but there was only one mouthful with a hint of charred flavour. Moreover, the hard rehydrated corn pieces and very sour blueberries floated in a seemingly solid sauce with some sections unbearably salty and others shockingly sweet, to the point of being highly unpleasant to eat. The other main, mussels with tomatillo and cheese, echoed the unpalatability of the lamb with a sauce that overpowered its other flavours. The mussels themselves were tasteless, and the leek and cheese offered no respite from the sheer saltiness. For dessert, the pear was delicately poached and seemed destined for a fantastic marriage with the silky sorbet - until we crunched into the unhappy surprise of countless tiny fragments in the sorbet. Colourless, flavourless and hard to the point that we worried about our teeth, these gritty pieces ruined the dish. From our first taste of the mains, we knew our anniversary dinner was a write-off, so we tried to ignore the food and take it in good humour. It was a very disappointing experience that we never want to replicate."

It was one of the first summery nights in Montreal so we were sat on their cute terrace overlooking a lane (the restaurant is in an old church in a park, which is charming as anything). The service was outstanding, with everyone indulging my jokey/curious/sometimes ridiculous stepfather. We started with a bottle of local sparkling wine- I didn't know they made this in Qbc! The tasting menu is fixed except for a choice of main, and it changes monthly. The started I remember most was a delicious mussel dish served in a delectable broth. I had the guinea fowl for my main and was not disappointed- perfectly cooked and so flavourful. All of the sauces are made to lick to the last drop! And the homemade bread which accompanied our meal, wow. We asked for more twice, and considered a third time but restrained ourselves. A fantastic venue for a special meal in Montreal, and reasonably priced for the experience and quality."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Over the past few years, the Locavore movement has become very strong in Montreal. The desire to showcase local produce throughout the seasons has been the calling card for more and more restaurants in the city. Amongst the chefs who are best know for this approach is John Winter Russell - now working out at Restaurant Candide in Little Burgundy. Located in a old church Rectory - behind the Salon 1861 - Candide is hidden off the beaten path a little bit. I have had it on my 'infamous' to-visit list for a while now. My wife decided to plan a secret date night for the two of us and so we headed out of our apartment and walked down Notre Dame Street until we arrived At Candide ready for a intimate dinner on their patio on a beautiful weeknight. Great surprise my love!The menu at Candide changes on a monthly basis - according to what is available locally - and is a fixed menu. They will adjust according to allergies however. It is a 4 course dinner for 51$ which frankly is a pretty good deal when you compare it to other fine eating establishments in the city. So the next question I am sure you are asking is but what about the portions themselves? Are they plentiful enough? And the answer is yes - we were both rather full at the end of the meal. Candide is a pretty good deal in that regard.... now what about the food itself?On top of the fixed menu, we were offered an extra dish to add at the start of our meal  - and of course I said yes. Marinated Whelk with cucumber, pickles and a herring mousse. This was our least enjoyed dish of the evening. I liked the flavour of the mousse but the rest felt honestly a little fad.Our next dish was more of a hit. Sliced kohlrabi coated in a yogourt sauce topped with beans, popcorn, marinated red onion and herbs. The presentation of the dish was beautiful - pretty much a constant element throughout the dinner -  and the flavours were wonderful. The yogourt sauce added a richness to the dish that didn't overwhelm. The popcorn was a cool crunch component that played well off the rest.Our next dish of fresh cherry tomatoes served on top of eggplant and clams was also a big hit. Hits of sweetness and acidity with the saltiness of the clams. I'm not a huge fan of raw tomatoes but this dish worked for me.For our main courses, we had a choice of 2 and so we decided to share them together. I went with the Guinea Hen served with corn and lobster mushroom. I loved this dish from A to Z - it was my big hit of the evening. The Hen was cooked perfectly - juicy and tender with the crisp skin on top. The mixture of the fresh corn and the lobster mushrooms was a great complement to the protein and felt very fresh - a perfect example of local seasonality.My wife went with the Arctic Char served over a pepper puree with carrots and onions. Beautiful piece of fish cooked as desired with a nice sweet pepper puree to pair with it. I didn't love the way the carrots mixed to the dish but my wife enjoyed pretty well.For dessert, you have the choice of a sweet one or a savoury once. On the sweet side, we had a maple biscuit served with fresh raspberry, a blueberry coulis and cantaloupe sorbet. Outside of the sorbet (not a melon fan), the rest of this dessert was amazing. Great fresh flavours all around - the maple notes tying it all together.On the savoury side, there was a piece of Pont Blanc cheese topped with fresh zucchini and zucchini flowers and served over a basil emulsion. I don't love savoury desserts but pulling away from that, as a dish, this was a very creative idea. The mix of basil and cheese paired nicely - as any pesto fan will tell you. Not the way I would finish a meal but still enjoyable.Candide was a wonderful experience of what our local produce can provide in the hands of a great kitchen. Beautiful dish presentation, great service throughout the night in a relaxed and intimate setting. My wife definitely nailed her date night surprise.... now to return the favour ;)Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=6ZSpch2_fmM8XySwKaqgog,Ben B.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"The night before going to Montreal, I had this dream.  I imagined I was in some frou-frou restaurant with all sharp angles, low lights and distressed wood, being given a rundown of the current local pre-fixe menu in what my unconscious mind conceived of as a Quebecois accent (i.e. French with an occasional ""aboot"" mixed in).  The food was meticulously assembled and delicious in a new and unconventional way.Little did I know that the next day all my dreams would come true.  Except the accent.  It's basically just French.Candide is set in the basement of an old church, which immediately puts it in legendary status for hipsterism.  Add to that some unfinished wood patios, and simple, vaguely rustic decor and you have the perfect setting for what comes next.  And that is a 2.5 hour pre fixe meal where you watch the chef himself make each one of your dishes not a couple feet from your table and then bring each one to you, along with an explanation peppered with weird ingredients.Each dish was a collection of interesting flavors from local ingredients.  Mussels with some kind of peppery crisp on top, curls of rutabaga with fried parsnip and probably the best piece of pork I've ever met.  My impression of French cuisine is that they do fairly simple preparations with an attention to detail bordering on obsessive.  That's the impression I got here.  I'm not usually one for flowery arrangements of vegetation on my dishes, but the design and the taste was really in sync here.Don't miss it!"
/user_details?userid=T8ImanqlT3KYn9G4oCYwrQ,Michelle P.,"Hudson County, NJ",4 star rating,"To start, I loved my amaretto cocktail. It was very smooth paired with my dinner. I personally am not the biggest fan of french food given my palette but I appreciated all the flavors and effort that went into each of my dishes. The fiddlehead appetizer was unique but a tad salty. the only thing I can compare the vegetable to is a combination between green bean and asparagus. My second course, the clams were light, on the sweet side with the cream, and sat in a beautiful sauce. The main course, a fish was sitting on an mushroom invoking such a strong umami flavor. I appreciated the crunch added by the puffed rice and the radishes was a nice refresh from the overall flavors in the dish. Finally, the dessert. I have never had dehydrated blueberries or rhubarb. But they really worked in my cake. I am converted to loving rhubarb with the aid of the strawberries now. The Jersey cheese was not a table favorite but I appreciate the enthusiasm from the kitchen!Overall, pretty good for a pre-fix dinner! I loved the location, the way the restaurant was open kitchen made the food being prepared all the more memorable. The chef coming out to explain each course served to the table and the silverware and new plating that came out for each course was attentive and so personal, I wish my usual dinners had that touch."

It is at the back of a former church circa 1891 between Notre Dame and Lionelle Grue of a dirt path. John the Owner-Chef uses only local and Canadian ingredients and put together a unique and special menu which is top drawer.  If you have any dietary restrictions vegan vegetarian celiac or allergies he will alter the menu of the evening for you with ease.

/user_details?userid=l4lxRlwfrYSESxtTMFHhLA,Olympia L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The dinner was lovely, the service was good, and the ambiance was really nice. When we received our dessert from the set menu, my friend was really not a fan, so I asked the waitress if they would change it for her - their response was: No problem at all, don't worry. At the price point of the restaurant, we expected for them to exchange the dessert, especially when the response was ""No problem at all"". Instead they charged us $13. In my experience, they should have mentioned that they would have to charge extra, or make a note of it when we received our bill.That (amongst other surprisingly high charges) made our dinner quite overpriced.What they should have said was: ""Sorry we don't have espresso, but we can charge you $7 for a pour-over coffee"" or""you didn't like our dessert? Too bad, here's another one for $13"". Who pays $13 for a dessert? They could have at least warned us. Money doesn't grow on trees.TLDR: They are sneaky, and will charge extra while putting on a smile."

/user_details?userid=-7HhYgohgiYWMhyjhD7LEw,Cheryl T.,"Tucson, AZ",5 star rating,"Wow this was a find. First, it's in the basement of an old church which makes it cozy and the decor is of natural wood and other material which makes it feel comfortable and authentic. We sat at the bar which I suggest because you can watch the staff slice bread, and prep and plate the food. The whole team , but John in particular, are extremely knowledgeable about the menu items and origins. Each course was fantastic and creative. The chanterelles and cauliflower were particularly amazing. And my dessert was a buttermilk yogurt in a squash blossom over a berry jam. Something innit had chive flour so it was this amazing combo of sweet and savory. Speaking of sweet- the menu is so local they don't make anything w refined sugar, as it is outside their sourcing area. Very cool. These guys are committed to local and innovative cuisine. I got the wine pairing but thought only two were good pairings. One from Nathan K, Finger Lakes region and another from north of Barcelona. But what lacked in pairing was more than made up for with highly unusual varietals and blends. If you are looking for a unique food experience, put this one on your list. They accommodate vegetarians easily. Oh and the bread is spectacular."

It's location is beautiful but difficult to find. I've eaten here a few times. I love the ambiance and service. The dishes use local and seasonal ingredients. The prix fix is$48 with the option of a wine pairing $40 (highly recommend doing the pairing). The majority of the dishes are tasty but beware  the ingredients can sometimes be odd. I am an adventurous eater so I'm fine w it, but my husband has balked at the dishes on occasion. It's hard to give details on the dishes since (to be honest) the ingredients were varied and strange & I'm not sure what I ate last time I visited except that  it was a type of fish and it was good :) If you prefer ordinary fare, this place is not for you."

The course menu is very straightforward and allows for some decision making with the entree and dessert. Every item was unique and showcased local fresh ingredients. It was probably the tastiest dinner I've had from beginning to end. I also appreciated that they did not try to rush us afterwards and we were able to relax and finish our wine.
/user_details?userid=gyzwVbfmJ9Az_USw13OjNQ,Sara G.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Do not recommend. We tried everything on the menu as we were a group of 5. The fixed price includes 4 courses, 2 of which you can choose from 2 options. The entree Crab, yogurt and carrots and the Hen of the woods are the same for everyone. You then have the choice of Halibut OR Guinea hen for main, and the Cheese plate OR the Blackberry ice cream cake for dessert.The hen of the woods was VERY salty. We spent a lot of debating whether the chef actually tastes the plates before sending them out because it was so salty that it was difficult to eat without the bread. Overall, the combination of flavors was very odd for 2 courses out of the 4 courses: Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes, and the Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet.Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes was covered with an orange sauce that tasted very odd: it had this sour tasting undertone that is similar to expired seafoods/meats. Not to mention that the sauce completely overpowers the taste of the Halibut: no way of telling how fresh the fish was.Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet was underwhelming: we had our share of dry and pickled eggplants so it's nothing new to us and the cheese (by itself) was actually pretty good, but the combination of flavor was not just working for us.The guinea hen, the blackberry ice cream dessert, and the Crab entree was pretty good. The presentation of the mains can also use some improvement: the entire plate was covered by green leaves and juste don't look like appetitive.We eat out fairly often and tried most of the hip and fine dinning places in Montreal. This is one of our least favorite ones."

I have to say Candide is a truly unique and memorable experience that should be indulged in if your a local or visitor in Montreal.Plenty of Montreal restaurants, and the cuisine in general, wants to celebrate its local ingredients and traditions in decadence.  Here, the team at Candide doubles down on the local ingredients with a hyper seasonal menu, and is able to amp up flavors with unique combinations while having a level of restraint, something rare in my short time in Montreal.In just about every city, these restaurants focused on hyper-seasonal menus, vegetable-heavy dishes served in bone and neutral colored plates with an emphasis on organic natural wines are popping up. John-Winter Russell's was as good if not better than all of my previous experiences. If you can sit at the chef counter and do the wine pairing, do it. Great explanation's of the dishes from the chef, and the server or sommelier will discuss the wines paired with each dish in length. Amazing food, amazing wine, cool atmosphere in an old church, Candide is more than worth the splurge.Oh and one more thing - if the cheese, sweet potato and buckwheat dish is available, get like 10 of them. All dishes were incredible but that's the dish I find myself craving daily."

/user_details?userid=OvkB2G-ZLhwocrIprjaYDw,Sara B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I was hesitant to try it out with a group from out of town after a recent Gazette review called the food ""bleak"". I am so pleased we decided to check it out for ourselves!This restaurant is tucked away on a little lane inside the basement of an old church. The menu is set at $45 for 4 courses with 2 options available for the main and dessert courses. Its ingredients are hyper-local and totally innovative. We ventured out in a -41 degree-feeling night and stepped into a venue with an energy and ambiance that warmed us up almost immediately. We were greeted by cheerful and helpful staff who waited on us with the utmost professionalism and consistency throughout the whole meal. They were so warm, so passionate, and so accommodating. When a few of our party weren't feeling adventurous enough to try venison hearts, they offered to bring out venison shoulder or a vegetarian alternative instead without missing a beat!  The food was plated and brought to us in a spectacular fashion. The timing between each course was perfect and the plates were reasonably sized for a 4-course meal. The food was generally delicious (the venison shoulder was a ~tad~ on the chewy side but still perfectly seasoned) and clearly put together with so much thought and love. The wine list is privately imported and excellent, the cocktail I ordered was to die for.This place is about so much more than food. It is an exercise in thought and a performance! Very highly recommended :)"
/user_details?userid=8IiPX3tSK9-bv4Ucr433Zw,Liquid R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about Candide, yet am still going to give it four stars driven more by my brain than my belly.The fact I am first to review this several months after it opened kind of confirms who I think it will appeal to the most - not the demographic using Yelp with regularity, but rather intellectual food purists who have a high appreciation of what Candide and its head chef, John Winter Russell, are striving for on a philosophical level.  Indeed, critics in both Le Devoir and Le Journal de Montreal have already heaped effusive praise upon the spot, which is what drew my attention to it in the first place.Set in the converted basement of a church, the space is aglow in dim, yellow light that accentuates the warm exposed wood. The restaurant serves what I would describe as ""elevated esoteric local,"" in that everything you will be served - with wine and coffee the lone exceptions - comes sourced from Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces.  So that means no olive oil, no lemons, and no pepper will be used in any capacity.  In contrast, you will find intriguing things like mushrooms foraged in the woods, leaves of grasses plucked from Atlantic coast beaches, and herbs found growing in the wild.  Russell works closely with foraging company Gaspesie Sauvage - if you're interested, go to their Web site and check out their photo gallery to see some the things that will likely end up on your plate in some capacity.The menu changes every month or so, but is inspired by the season.  For a very reasonable $45 you will get a four-course prix-fixe dinner that includes two appetizers, a choice of two mains, and a choice of a sweet dessert or a cheese plate.  You can also match each course with individualized wine pairings for an additional $40/pp, but in my view you're just as well off buying a decent bottle (and they have a nice little list) for around the same amount and going from there.But what of the food?  Well, that's the thing.  Throughout the four courses of dinner, I realized I was consistently tasting things or looking at the presentation and thinking, ""Now that's interesting!"" or ""I've never had this combination of flavors before!"" but never, ""wow, this is absolutely AMAZING!""  My palate truly felt more like it was going through an academic exercise rather than simply delighting in what it was tasting. On the whole, the food was innovative as could be, yet still, undeniably, just a bit odd.My recommendation: if you're willing to eat things that really can't be categorized, check out Candide's site and take a look at their menu to first validate that their limited options of the moment appeal to you (even if you don't recognize some of the ingredients).  Then, enter your dining experience with an open mind; even if you remain unconvinced by what you ate at meal's end, at the very least you will have been served by a passionate staff and chef dedicated to what I can appreciate is a more sustainable way of cooking and eating, and in a cozy and relatively unpretentious venue, to boot."
/user_details?userid=gOHJswZrdJUiPjjWubTk3w,Lainy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Great experience! We came here last minute on the suggestion of a friend/local who joined us in the afternoon, prompting some last minute reservation switching. Every dish was beautifully composed and included unique local ingredients. We were even able to try local wines on the suggestion of the sommelier. The atmosphere is unique - the basement of an old church. We ate inside so we were able to peek into the open kitchen as well. The service was fantastic and very friendly. They even gave us a list of staff favorites recommended other places to check out in Montreal and beyond. The one minor complaint is that they ran out of squash blossoms for our party (we saw them plating it for an earlier table) and it took quite a long time for some of our courses even though by the time we were dining it was pretty late so we were one of the last parties to leave. However since they had the reservation glitch, these were understandable. Really one of the best dining experiences I've had this year. While not cheap, it's pretty reasonably priced for the quality and number of courses, which is a huge plus."

Wine pairing was terrific, unpretentious but extremely knowledgeable sommelier. Flavor combinations that are unexpected and delicious. Best preparation of lamb I've ever had.

/user_details?userid=lLx7sVxTr_i7Z4oxKN0b4g,Greg H.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Candide is definitely worth a visit. They were able to get our party of two in right away at the chef's table (a converted church pew, like much of the rest of the restaurant furniture).The food was local, fresh, with many items from their garden just outside. The staff was extremely attentive and walked us through the menu and our selected dishes. The kitchen staff were methodical in an almost Zen way - no rushing, cursing, everything was done to set (and maintain) a peaceful relaxing tone.Great way to end a busy and stressful week, really enjoyed, will go again next time I'm in town."

/user_details?userid=45a80P9nVpMtS7bZQ1kRmw,Catherine P.,"Morris Plains, NJ",4 star rating,"Four of us came here for dinner last night and it was absolutely excellent. Great atmosphere and great food. I had read some reviews that complained the food was bland. None of us had anything that could be considered bland. All of the food had excellent flavor and a great blending of flavors. The wine pairings were interesting and just right. Well done. Service was attentive and excellent. Candide's philosophy is to use locally sourced food from Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. This seems to be working well for them and I would like to return when they have more local produce. We were able to have a fun time and talk and the people around us seemed to be able to do the same. In other words, you could hear your table company ions speaking and you did not hear others. Great sound control. The only down side is that it's very hard to find. The restaurant is at the rear of a former church and there is no signage at the front of the church indicating where the restaurant is located. The taxi took us around the block a few times and then our friend phoned the restaurant and they gave us the information we needed to get there. The four of us left very happy with everything and sincerely hoping that this new restaurant (opened in January) makes a go of it ... In terms of food, service and atmosphere, it deserves to."

The kind that makes you stop and savour every bite. The wines to match are totally on point - and the explanation from the Somm - Emily - is really impressive. The chef makes the food in front of the 'chefs table' so make sure you reserve to sit there. Lots of interaction with the chef and all staff which makes you feel at home. Great spot - totally recommend!"
/user_details?userid=X3nRtVpJ855MCRM9pcpnmg,Andy G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had an absolutely lovely time at this under-the-radar restaurant. My partner and I got the $45 four course set menu sans wine. Each dish was evidently well-prepared and executed, using ingredients sourced from the surrounding region. The pork main was, in particular, a highlight, being seasoned and cooked to perfection. Big props for doing proper tableside V60 pour-overs of locally roasted beans from Dispatch; it's always refreshing to see a restaurant defying the trend of nicer places resorting to crappy, industrial-sized pots of filter. Service was also impeccable. Hoping to see this place continue to thrive!"
/user_details?userid=qrrUJ1GfZ9Lh1ni5v6yARA,Joe S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A little hard to find on a rainy night, but that was part of the fun. I liked the decor; rustic, great tables that I expect were purpose built, lovely overhead lamps casting 'just right' light. A simple seasonal four course menu, on the two courses that offered a choice, we made sure we didn't duplicate. Sustainable and local were paramount. Service was outstanding: friendly, warm, knowledgable. Good bread was always at the ready. The dishes were very good and well though out.  All poutine heads ought to be introduced to the puree of smoked potatoes that coddled one of the mains. Special kudos to the sommelier. Her pairings were all a bit unusual and interesting."
/user_details?userid=ddXmh2KPUGLdwpSDixuPgg,Nathan L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1 star rating,"I don't typically give Yelp reviews, but this was special: it was the WORST restaurant experience of my life. Let me count the ways:1) We sat out on the porch which is essentially in the backyard of a public housing development. Not exactly the most romantic atmosphere.2) They serve you a four-course meal. It took them AT LEAST 30 minutes to bring out each serving. We got there at 7:30pm and we were there until 10:30pm - that's how long it took them to bring out all the plates. 3) Each plate was very small in that pretentious haute-cuisine style and after waiting 30 minutes for each plate, I left starving.4) The food was a sad attempt at being creative, locally-sourced, etc. etc.  In the end it was mis-matched flavors with no seasoning and I even cringed a few times while eating it. The grated venison jerky was like sawdust. The radish butter tasted like freshly mown grass. The rice puffs were almost as interesting as Rice Krispies but with less flavor. 5) They served under-cooked scallops and I got some light food poisoning. Also these scallops were served on giant, tasteless, supermarket-grade asparagus stalks on top of yogurt. Yes, that's right: scallops on top of yogurt. 6) I dropped $48 per person for me and my wife plus $10 each for a cocktail, so let's just review what I got for almost $130: I sat in the backyard of a public housing development for three hours, I left hungry, the food was bad, the concept was pretentious, they held us hostage for three hours while they took 30 minutes to bring out each serving, and it was over-priced.They should think about re-consecrating the church this restaurant is in, so they can pray for forgiveness for the culinary abomination that they are unleashing on the world. In the meantime I will be praying in vain to get my $130 back."

Very charming location and the experience only got better after walking in. Perfectly sized set menu was interesting, amazing flavors/textures. Sommelier and wine pairing were well thought out, and a little different, but definitely good different. This is a unique dining experience but not at all strange, very warm, welcoming, delicious and above all done with love."

Food is closest to the esthetic that you would find in San Francisco ( where I am from) than in anyplace I have been to in Montreal. Great room and location though hard to find. I will definitely go back and look forward to seeing the change in the seasons through the chefs eyes.

/user_details?userid=0zF6wVl0hoXDX0qVHupi9Q,Brandon M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"We enjoyed many delicious meals during our week in Montreal, but I dare say Candide was indeed the best. We were seated at the chef's counter and were overwhelmed by his attention to detail and his overall charm as he served us and described each dish in great detail. As we dined on the autumn menu, we awaited each course with excitement as we knew something special was on the horizon. Most beautiful of all was the setting. On a brisk autumn evening, the environment added a picturesque backdrop for a damn near perfect meal."
/user_details?userid=DHyE3mQ7QtulRGrFNDvpDg,Jean-Francois L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I completely agree with that first review from Liquid R.The plates are apealing from an intelectual perspective albeit not very palatable. The Maillard reaction is omnipresent. Everything is slightly burth, slightly fumé and then deglazed in an Umami broth. From the grilled mushrooms, to the roasted oat and the deer brazed heart, every presentation is brownish in a brownish sauce and the four courses were surprisingly similar in taste, smell and looks. The meat, deer heart, was cooked to perfection, grilled but pink. But the texture was horrible, chewy like a sticky rice cake and completely in disharmony with the berries in the sauce and the acridity of the Kale sprouts. Too bad, I normally love those places off the street, with an undergroud feel as if you were priviledged just to have been informed it exists. But Candide pushes the monochromy of flavours, colours and gloom way too far for my taste. I wish them luck but will not go back."

/user_details?userid=Sp42UYEuooAF8xTesa86Dg,Justin A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"It was really hard to find, and the whole experience was underwhelming. The service was strange and borderline bad - the server sat us at a table where the lights were not working even though there were open tables that were properly lit, the server took my drink order and then forgot to take my friend's, and the server didn't ask how any of the food was during the entire meal. Speaking of the food, it was boring and just totally bland. The meat was overcooked, everything was under seasoned, and more of less every dish had an uninspired mushy quality. I would have given this place one star, but the wine selection was good and the interior was really lovely. Overall though - avoid."
