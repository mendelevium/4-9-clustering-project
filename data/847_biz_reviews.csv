The pasta is handmade and cooked to perfection. The sauce is absolutely wonderful and full of flavor. Everyone working was so nice and made us feel right at home. This place just makes you want to take your time and enjoy a wonderful meal. Definitely save room for coffee and biscotti at the end!

All their desserts are as fresh as they come. The biscotti are so soft and delicious, one bite and it instantly takes you to a better place and older time. And I have never tasted such a beautiful and scrumptious cream filled sfogliatelle until now. Oh my God, it's fantastic! The cafe has a nice patio too! Other tables were having Pasta and Osso Bucco and different entrees of such, those items looked great too. We thought this place was so charming! Service is phenomenal. Actually became our favourite cafe in Montreal, no comparison!!"
