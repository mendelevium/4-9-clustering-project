/user_details?userid=4cRQ8Ys-UQ3mcUKJ4cqGXA,Tiffany L.,"Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Their bun bo hue is delicious! Whenever I have a craving but don't feel like making it myself, this is my go to. I would have given them a 5 star but unfortunately if you order the sweet vietnamese coffee by uber eats, the cup size is less than half a glass cup, but it also tastes really good."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm not a huge fan of pho, I think it's good but I wouldn't eat it all the time. I'm also not good at determining what is authentic and what isn't. That being said, I did enjoy eating here. Portions are big for the price and it is tasty.Cash only and this is a very popular place so it will get busy."

/user_details?userid=WVzff6WDqhqksu8pkVZvFQ,Madita A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I decided to eat out for the first time since the start of the pandemic, so I was full of anticipation and expectations when I went to Pho Lien to get my first Pho fix of 2020.Sadly the patio and dining room were closed, so take out was the only option.  I ordered the smallest No 1 Pho Dac Biet.The service was quick and friendly, but the soup was just ok. The broth was a little bland and oily. Instead of Thai basil, the garnish had cilantro. That's not a good substitution IMO. Overall the garnish was a bit skimpy - very little onions and a teeny tiny lime wedge. Noodles and meat were fine. The portion was huge, and I got very stuffed and wasn't even able to finish.Overall, I prefer Sen Vang, where the broth has a more distinct taste of star aniseed and cloves, and I get my basil."

I love Vienamese food and my go to dish is pork vermicelli salad platter. Lots of people, that's a good sign.The service was quick, but holy cow is the staff dour and surely... you get the feeling like they don't want you there. Worst table side manner that'd experienved in a long time.The dish was just average, most Vietnamese places make a better version of this dish.Normally that would make it 3 star, but I have to dock a star for staff demeanor."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I consider Pho Lien my favourite pho joint in Montreal, although there are quite a few good ones. I think the Pho I've had here beats many other highly rated Vietnamese restaurants in bigger cities. There are only so many places that get their pho right in the city, and this is one of em. You know it's legit when other Vietnamese people come eat here too. Service: as per usual in Asian restaurants, the service was fast and efficient. Food: I come here to satisfy my pho craving and I go out satisfied every time. And I always get the three colour drink as dessert cuz I just can't stop eating. Warning: they only take cash here."

/user_details?userid=eY6TPklHTeOaQt9F8a_SGQ,Tracy T.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Not bad, Montreal. Not bad.Surely not the best bowl of pho I've ever had but since I'm from Toronto, the pho here definitely hit the spot. A hot savoury bowl of broth filled with soft rice noodles and sliced beef, topped with scallions and bean sprouts. Mmm, what else would you want on a cold day?"
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",4 star rating,"My first pho ever! Ordered the number 1, which comes with well done flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and rare beef. It comes in small, large, and XL. Chose the large and was amazed by the size - the picture really doesn't do it justice. You'll be full for sure! And honestly the price difference is pretty moot between the different sizes so you'll definitely be tempted to get the bigger size for your money's worth. The broth was pretty salty but had sweet undertones with anise, onion, and other aromatics. The noodles were just noodles, nothing spectacular. The beef was very good and I really enjoyed the variety of textures. Unfortunately by the time we got our soup the rare beef was pretty much cooked through. The soups come with a side of raw bean sprouts, lime wedges, and basil(? - I could be mistaken) and there is hoisin and sriracha on the table, though I preferred the soup without any condiments. The menu is very affordable and has lots of options in addition to pho, including grill plates, spring rolls, and rice. Note that it's cash only, but there is an ATM in the restaurant. It can get crowded fast - it's a popular place! Service is rather gruff, so don't expect smiling faces or greetings, but you come here for the food, not for the vibe."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Such good pho. Reliably great taste! I usually get the raw beef and tendon one! You can choose between big or small bowls. Only downside is that it's slightly pricier.
/user_details?userid=_JFLxu16xDGsoGOQjjoWhw,Ngan Ha H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Well, this is probably the best pho in Montreal (until now), beef is delicious, I would say all kind of beef here.I've been here twice or three times and it's always crowded, most of people chose Pho as their main dish. The service is okay, it's a bit loud.Price per person is reasonable, it's even better if you go there with 3, 4 people and share your dishes (not pho but the other ones). Unfortunately, I heard that Pho Lien's employees can't receive their tips and the owners don't treat them in a good way. That's why sometimes I hesitate having dinner there if I don't really crave for some Pho"
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is in a good location, right on the corner of two main streets. I do find it a bit pricey for what it is. The service is good. Their pho's are tasty (I'm picky about good broth), but spring rolls barely have any shrimp. Also the soups we got were not hot enough."
/user_details?userid=nGvLkjB8QxFuhDMP1-IIDA,Dash H.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,"Nothing special here. Move it along.Even though it had 1139 great reviews of 4.5 stars... i was expecting too much. I feel like ppl see a few leaves of basil and mint here and there they wet their panties thinking its the best food-gasm they've ever had. Amateurs. Ive had WAY better. Sorry NOT sorry guys. Ive gone out of my way today to go and try this Pho Lien because of the reviews, and this also was disappointing just like my last thai restaurant with 4.5 stars.Me and my gf ordered the papaya salad with beef jerky for $7 ... 2 chopsticks full and you're done with the entire plate. And the worst thing was, it wasn't even great. It was average. The ponzu sauce tht disguised as fish sauce, was like sour and sweet. Ehhhhh.. no spice... no good. Its not worth $7, they need to either plate more or lower that price down. Next we ordered the Pho with rare beef and tendons. He broth had too much of one ingredient and not enough of another. I tasted a lot of fish sauce, theres no sweetness in the soup, there might be less ginger and also less star spices in there too. Overall the pho was not good. Adding a little bit of lime and sriracha along with hoisin might help the flavor a little bit . But honestly pho should be already perfect as it is, and only should be using the other outside condiments as options to add on, not requirements... next up, the Bun thit bo nuong. They used the rare beef from the pho to grill this baby up. The meat was good , on the contrary, the noodles was very dry (even with the whole sauce cup dumped on it) it tasted stale, and almost like they just took it out of the plastic wrap bag. Dipped it in boiling hot water for like 5 seconds and served it.The veggies were fresh, thank goodness for that. As for the fish sauce, it was not sweet like it should be for this type of dish. I took 2 bites and could not finish this. 3 out of 5Not being an ass, ppl def need to know what theyre getting themselves into."
/user_details?userid=km3lnJeuDtQrtKxyU1Dwfg,Trevor T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Alright! I eat a lot of pho, and so I came here with *expectations*, as I heard that this was the best Pho in Montreal. I have been to other pho restaurants in Toronto and Montreal, and I feel that although this is certainly not the best pho I've ever had, it was decent and will definitely satisfy your pho-cravings! We came around 8pm on a Saturday night, and the place was packed! The service was fast, but our server looked overworked and uncomfortable. I ordered their Pho #12, with rare beef, beef tendons and tripe. The flavor was there, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The noodle to topping ingredients ratio seemed a little off--there weren't quite enough toppings. However, my biggest grip with the meal was that the pho was so hot that the rare beef was already VERY, VERY well-done by the time it came to the table. If I had wanted well-done beef, I would have ordered it instead! I also ordered a three colored dessert, which was delicious as expected. Coconut milk, green grass jelly, mung beans and red bean in a delicious layered drink. There was just a little too much ice in my drink, which detracted from it just a little bit, but the flavors were incredible! I would recommend Pho Lien if you need your pho fix, but it was not amazing, despite the rave reviews. Not sure if it's worth the wait if they have a long line. Worth a try!"
/user_details?userid=n48dY8HJAYd1j1sjDF-pFQ,Rachel L.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Tasty, fast and polite. Did I mention tasty? Best pho lunch this side of North America. Cash reigns and be prepared to be accommodating in seating."

/user_details?userid=cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,David Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"Many locals say this place has the best pho in Montréal. Parking was easy because I was lucky. I was able to find a parking spot right out front of the restaurant, but be warned you might have to drive around a bit to find a parking space.  The place was busy, but luckily I was able to get the last available table.  They try to seat as much people as possible in this small restaurant. Hence the tables are real close together.  The menu was only written in French and English. I ordered their extra large pho dac biet (special beef noodle) and was not disappointed.  Their pho soup base was very tasty and you get quite a large assortment of meats on top.  The rare beef, though, was mostly well done when I received my bowl.  You also get a good portion of noodles in the pho. Would I come back?  Of course!"

Although Alex really liked it, I wasn't a huge fan of the broth. I prefer a sweeter broth. So to me, the pho was good, but there was a little something missing in their pho broth.

/user_details?userid=VMfwMYh8iJapW807Pu1Diw,Jenviev A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",5 star rating,"What can I say other than: the best Pho in town. Yep, their broth is on fleek (haha inside joke). But yeah, the Pho is incredible and definitely worth traveling for. They also have deliciously fresh spring rolls, that melt in your mouth and seem to be the perfect pairing with Pho imo. As opposed to the other Pho places, I have to admit, I've never tried anything else on their menu - not sure if it's because it didn't seem appealing or if it's because the Pho is so damn good I didn't notice anything else. Either way, come and have the Pho!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was told this place had THE best pho in town, but I was skeptical. My favorite spot so far had been Pho Bang New York in Chinatown, so I was excited to see how Pho Lien would fare. We went there around 7h30 Friday night. It was cold, windy and raining, and the walk from metro Côte-Sainte-Catherine to Côte-des-Neiges seemed like an eternity. The place looked terribly busy, with its cramped tables, noisy patrons, and steamy windows. Thanksfully, out friends had saved us a table, so we sat down right away. We all ordered #1, which is the usual bowl of pho with beef and tripes, along with chè ba màu (three color... pudding? dessert? drink?). My boyfriend grabbed bun ga nuong (rice vermicelli + grilled chicken), emperial rolls and cafe sua dan (vietnamese coffee) instead. The drinks came first, followed by the emperial rolls and the main dishes. The food was delicious - so much that there's not much to say about it. The broth was rich, flavorful and not too oily or salty. The beef was tender and slightly fatty, and melted in mouth. It is the best pho in town? From what I've seen so far, it might just be! The chè ba màu is a must try if you like coconut. It's not very sweet, and all flavors tasted natural. I can't wait to have it again this summer! The cafe sua dan was also very well balanced. The coffee was quite strong, and perfectly diluted by the condensed millk and ice. The emperial rolls were the only things that were kind of meh. They were a bit too dry and not very interesting overall.Prices are not the cheapest in the pho category, but are still very reasonable. Especially given how satisfying the meal was. I might just sneak onto bus 165 for a lunchtime visit one of these days!Note: Internet stopped working on my cellphone inside the restaurant?"
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a classic Vietnamese family restaurant. They definitely know how to make great pho because their broth is pretty damn good! The restaurant itself is ok, nothing special but the service is good and quick. I find the prices a little more expensive than most pho places though and it's cash only."
/user_details?userid=r6PhNkr4EVaaqjfwywn7aQ,思颖,"Trois-Rivières, Canada",3 star rating,"The place was as crowded as usual. After having waited for 15minutes we were lead to a table which was very near to the toilettes, like 2meters away, and there was water on the floor, that made me really uncomfortable. We waited for an another 10minutes to change a table.The pho was tasty though, but it wasn't the best one I tried in montreal. Soupe of the noodle was a little bit sweet, but I was amazed by the abundant amount of beef in the bowl. Liked the drink with red beans, coconut milk and other ingredients.And don't forget to bring enough cash because they don't accept any card. To withdraw cash, you gotta get them at the mini ATM which will charge additionally $1.5...Even though it isn't flawless, but it is still a very popular and comparatively worth going restaurant in the cote des neiges area."

It's actually embarrassing to admit since I consider myself quite the foodie. Because I have nothing to compare it to, it's possible that I just don't like Pho very much. We came here on a Sunday night around 9 and the place was pretty full...usually a good sign. We each ordered a different small bowl of Pho and spring rolls to share. The sauce the spring rolls came with was delicious and we enjoyed them. The pho came in a pretty big bowl with bean sprouts on the side. Put simply, I just didn't like it. The meat seemed low quality and the broth had a weird after taste. I was pretty disappointed. Service was fine. They only accept cash. I found the price a bit high for the quality."

Tried it the first I went there a few years ago and never thought of ordering something else! Also do be aware that this restaurant is more for a quick eat.

I believe that the first time i came here i was about 10 years old. I am way older now lol! The food is still delicious and i must say the service has improved tremendously! I live the owner! We all call her auntie. The pho is obviously the main attraction but as the bot chien and the bun bo hue. Let's not forget about the three colour dessert here. It's so well balanced. Not too sweet. The only problem that i see here is the parking. If you don't come early enough, it is kind of hard to park. In the summer time, they open up a terrace and you can enjoy your food under the sun which is quite pleasant."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I admit that I have been eating their food far too much lately, it's so convenient when I'm in the area at least a couple times a week. I've had their rare beef pho a few times and their grilled chicken combo meal a few times as well. Their pho is hearty and the flavor of the both is well developed, without it being too salty. Their combo meals are a pretty good value and I'm always satisfied afterward. I really don't have a negative thing to say, they are fast - even for take out. The only reason I'm not rating this 5 stars is because they are cash only - this is a digital world and it's time to offer more options to clients."

/user_details?userid=mLEf9N7KTAtAVns5YKFOTw,Nathalie N.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"My favourite Pho restaurant in Montreal. It tastes just like home. First of all, the broth is prefect. It is rich and flavourful. I tend to taste the broth before adding any extra sauces in. That is how you can taste the "" beefy"" in Pho .^.^. Then you can modify the broth as you like. I tend to  go extra spicy.  It helps for common cold by adding extra pepper. Second and sadly, the restaurant is too small and not clean at all. Avoid  using their washroom. And sometime you have to sit on the special table that only few feet away from the washroom. And that is not really what you want. And, if you going during the lunch or dinner time, it will be a long waiting line. But it worth it .^.^."

However, I find the meat here a bit cold, maybe it was because I ordered the soft tendons. Either way, I think the Pho here could be better if they paid a bit more attention to food preparation and details. The Pho comes in multiple sizes, I recommend the Medium size because that's what will most likely fill you up! Small one would be good for a snack.Overall, nice Pho restaurant because I can't find a better one in Montreal but I think there is room for improvement on food quality.Friendly reminder that it is cash only."

It was served with a nice plate of lime, bean sprouts and Thai basil. Broth was delicious even before doctoring it to taste with limes and sriracha.  Generous portions of meat and noodles.

My friend liked it much more than I did. I prefer Pho Bang NY by a large margin. This place is far quieter though (if you prefer that). Very different geographic location so optimizing between one place or the other probably isn't worth it. Just go w convenience.
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pho here is really good, I rarely drink the broth when eating pho at a restaurant, but the broth is so good at Pho Lien that I always gulp it down. I always go for the pho dac biet, I really think it is the best since there is plenty of meat (it is possible to ask for extra meat for some extra dollars). The Che Ba Mau is also really good, not frozen at all like some places where I have been before. Only problem with this place is that it is always crowded, especially during lunch (expect at least 10-15 minutes of wait), but the wait is worth it, especially during cold winter days."

When I am traveling I never go to the same place twice no matter how good the place is. However since this place was SO GOOD my husband and his friend literally protested to go here again before our departure. Their spring rolls and Pho were really nice! :D Definitely going back for more soup & noodle!!"

I ordered the rare beef pho and some minced pork spring rolls. Both were delicate and flavored just right. downsides:It's small and cramped- you may get seated at a table in very close proximity to others and it is kind of a slog from the metro (uphill). Parking can be found on one of the side streets if you're driving and willing to walk a block or two. I think it is cash only so be prepared for that.

We had read about it on Yelp and decided to give it a try.We came right before the lunch rush around 11:45 and got a table beside the window. We really didn't know what to order but our server was nice enough to help us out. We ordered the imperial rolls to start. They came in less then 5 minutes and they were amazing! We couldn't quote figure out what was in them but it didn't matter! Then I got the chicken pho soup (can't remember the actual name) and my hubby got the beef soup. Again...we waited less then 10 minutes total. The soup was piping hot and the portions were HUGE! The flavours were so unique that at first I wasn't sure if I really liked it. I added some of their teriyaki sauce into it and the flavours just came of life! The more I ate...the more I wanted to eat! It was sooooo good!!! A totally new flavor profile then we've ever had!The service and food were outstanding. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stats is because of the ambiance and hustle/bustle of the restaurant. Had I not read all the reviews on yelp, I would have never eaten there after walking into it. It's a bit of a dive restaurant...no decor and just a bunch of tables jammed in there. Plus as the restaurant started filling up...we felt a bit rushed. Our whole lunch was about 45 minutes long. So if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and lounge...I wouldn't go here. But overall...outstanding food for our first time! Thank you ""Yelpers"" for helping us find this little gem!"

My friend and I came here after work since we heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. We ended up ordering a large beef tripe pho and shared it because it was an awkward time to eat dinner for us (5pm). The food was really good - best I've tried in Montreal. Taste was authentic, they give you so much sprouts, basil, etc which is great because I've been to places where they have been...stingy on that. A large was definitely the perfect size - I was extremely full by the time we were finished. My friend also seemed to really like the place too. We're probably going back soon haha.The service was okay. What I didn't really enjoy here was probably the floors. It was very sticky and humid where we were sitting. I'm not sure if there was probably a spill or we were just in a bad corner, but I would be a bit weary on picking my choice of sitting space next time."

(probably indicating that the food was all prepared at the back, which is fine for a cheap restaurant on a busy lunch hour) . The Pho broth was way to salty and there was a hair in the vermicelli bowl... Not my best experience at a Vietnamese place.  I would not go back there.Not recommended."

/user_details?userid=-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw,Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",4 star rating,"This very diverse neighborhood on the western slope of Mont Royal is loaded with a United Nations of  shops and restaurants. Feeling homesick for any home cooking on the planet?  You can probably find a reasonably good facsimile of your desired taste somewhere along Cote des Neiges or its side streets.  We came for Pho, and that was what we devoured in noisy slurps at Pho Lien. This fairly small joint has a front outside dining area which always seems full in good weather, while it is easier to find a table within.  The staff is super efficient and friendly in French, English and Vietnamese.  The Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) comes in three sizes, the smallest of which is likely to be enough for all but the biggest eaters, especially if you start with the Spring Rolls or other delectable apps.  The broth is the clear variety with a full bodied flavor.  The noodles are rectangular linguini-like, firm and tasty.  The side plate of accessories-sprout, basil leaves and lime wedges (no jalapeno slices), was full and fresh.  The sliced white meat chicken was plentiful.  A squirt of Stiraccha and the slurping commenced.  I know it is considered gauche to slurp when using the Asian flat bottomed spoon, but even when I try to be quiet, I can't do it. The overall taste is so compelling and succulent, that I just don't care.  The Spring Rolls were pretty good, with nice size shrimp and a slice of grilled pork inside.  Perhaps, a half step down from the Pho-ntastic soup. The VN coffee with condensed milk was great, and a nice way to extend the afternoon as we took in the life on the street, and plotted our next move."

The variety of beef tendons, shanks, stripes mixed with the perfect broth with chili oil. It's the ultimate comfort food with a hint of spiciness to stimulate the taste. The essence of the dish is all in the broth, the heavenly broth. Simply the best food anyone could ask for on a cold winter day.I discovered their Bún Thit Bò Xào during a conference week in Montreal and came back 3 times for it. The stir fried beef is marinated perfectly, cooked to tenderness but still maintains its chewy texture and strength. The vermicelli, fresh and light, topped with fresh vegetables. Delicious, flavorful and nutritious.I love love love this place, it's no wonder it's always packed, no matter what time of the day.

The flavor was rich and complex for such a humble dish. I ordered a large and my portion was enormous. It came with a plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts to add as I saw fit. In addition to the veg, there are also some sauces at the table you can add to the soup. My wife and I had the same soup, but after we had each added our desired sauces and vegetables, our dishes were unique and different! At that point all that was left to do was to slurp to our troubles awayPho Lien is a true gem that is worth visiting again and again and again"

It was around 7:30 on a Saturday night when I went and there was already a line. The restaurant isn't big so the tables are quite close together. I ordered the classic beef pho.

The pork chop with vermicelli was sub-par and veggies with it looked a bit raged.Hopefully there are better Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal.  Probably one of the more forgettable dining experiences on our trip.Yelp and Google are getting so frustrating to determine if you are getting the straight goods or not on the ratings.  This is definitely not a 4 starfor when we attended."

The first time I had their bun bo hue, I liked it; not so much the 2nd and 3rd time so I gave up on it.  As for their pho, there were days it was alright to good and there were days it was off.  There have been occasions where I just love the smell of pho as I stepped in, but am disappointed by the body of the broth itself. I feel they water it down and by how much depends on how busy they were expecting to be and how prepared they were for the rush.  The last time I was there was for a weekday lunch with my cousin. The place was packed throughout the whole place and including their patio.  It was this time where I had experienced the blandest pho broth I have ever had. On top of it, my cousin ordered and 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef pho and the chicken was not fresh at all. You can taste that ""old refrigerated"" taste. This makes me question the freshness of their food.  On top of that, the chicken was shredded into fine pieces.  It will be a long while before I consider coming back here again."

Oh well, It just means I have to keep going back to Montreal, and that is definitely fine by me."

/user_details?userid=NNoMPBgkH57LTGd5h1zMgA,Binh D.,"Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace, Canada",4 star rating,Probably the best pho in town. Been around for ages and still going strong. Perfect for a fast lunch during a cold winter day. A must try if youre in the area. Be prepared to wait in line a bit.
/user_details?userid=oIuKHLEU1AIBUM6g2AQy-Q,Elliot Hon Yuan N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Arguably one of the best pho restaurant in Montreal. Portion slightly smaller than other competitors for x-large size. Very quick service.
/user_details?userid=4v8K9nbIiASxt2B1y3IyXA,Babak M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Perhaps they have the best Pho in Montreal. The broth is absolutely delicious.The spring rolls are very tasty and fresh as well. Don't forget to have cash on you.
/user_details?userid=wfJ0a0cgMIm3JR6QjNn9pw,Emma C.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,I was at pho lien last night after reading the reviews from yelp. It's a little disappointed. I have the grilled pork chop over rice and my husband has the beef noodle. The food was average and portion was small compare to pho Tay ho which has a much flavorful broth. Will I return? Probably not.
/user_details?userid=WW8xQsb9dcZYs4kHOalppw,Ivan Jo G.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"Good service but the food is not so good. we order 2 rice menu and 1 pho. All of us agreed that the food is not as good as the one we tried in vancouver, bc."
/user_details?userid=mAxjf8tc1ZvZ_rVciXkLQw,Ethan H.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,"We r visiting Montreal and craving for pho, we went to Pho Lien ordered pho, com, bun, coffee. The pho broth is good but all the orders we ordered is under portion, iced coffee is a slap in the face (2 sips), service is terrible (feel like they don't need customers) wait staffs don't know their menu!!!"
/user_details?userid=MieuIn24iFp_fD3E5biDxg,I L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"PROS:1. DELICIOUS food. I especially enjoyed their Pho and Condensed milk/Iced Coffee- So gooood! Other items I tried were all really good too and the vegetables used are all fresh. 2. Servers mean business! They're quick, efficient, and accurate.3. Haven't been able to find a place with better pho than here. CONS:1. Perhaps not the swankiest place in town, but the food makes up for it. I would rather go here than The Keg... just sayin'!OVERALL:-Worth every penny!!"
/user_details?userid=WCHArapR0ZhduJElR9axjA,Farin I.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"The place was packed when we got there...Portions came quite nifty so dont order a large if youre not too too hungry. We had Pho and the spring rolls. The rolls had basal in them but they were quite yummy, and I also enjoyed the pho. Overall great experience and will definitely come back soon!"
/user_details?userid=i41jEKLHs8eLkcZEdH7Kiw,Kenji W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went there as a recommendation from a friend who said this was the best pho in town. Lets say that my expectations were not met. The broth was thin, the pieces of meat were ok at best, even with the hoisin sauce. But hey, it's pretty above average so you won't be completely disappointed."
/user_details?userid=Iqhno-7X64kQ7nij7Tnw7g,Ames M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Been going here forever and is still my favorite pho restaurant. Always order the pho and number 45 for a drink and have never been disappointed!
/user_details?userid=-nAaqwNizyYCZ5cun1MU6w,Janice C.,"Cape Coral, FL",3 star rating,"This place is pretty average.  Their pho is a good size and tastes alright.  Not the best, but not bad.  The vermicelli with grilled pork, which costs more than the extra large pho, was pretty small and did not fill me up at all. Although the grilled pork was quite good.  The Imperial rolls were a real disappointment. Mostly wrapper, with hardly any filling. Service was efficient, if not particularly friendly."
/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This steamy bowl of Vietnamese comfort food hits the spot and I'm convinced it tastes better in the winter when the temperature outside if a bone chilling minus ridiculous degrees and just a word of warning... Like with Korean BBQ, the smell of pho will permeate your clothes and people on the bus will know exactly what it was you had for lunch. Don't get discouraged by the phoddicts lining up out the door, people move through the place like milking cattle, you won't wait more than 10 mins at the most."
/user_details?userid=IM6ss5QP852np0C4Ponv2g,Concertina F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So the consensus is that Pho Lien is one of the best, if not THE best pho place in Montreal. It's my personal favourite and I frequently make the pilgimmage from downtown to Cote des Neiges to get my fix.Here are three things to keep in mind about Pho Lien:a) Always remember that it's closed on Tuesdays. There really is nothing worse than getting shut down when trying to satisfy a craving (or appease your addiction).b) Cash only! Although they have one of those money-grubbing private ATM machines in-house if you're really in a bind.c) Keep in mind that unless you eat outside on the terrasse, you are going to stink to high heaven when you leave this place. I'm not saying the place stinks, cause oddly enough, it doesn't. Just don't wear your good clothes here, and certainly don't expect to go on a blind date or an important meeting immediately after eating here and still expect to make a good impression. I had to have my winter jacket dry cleaned after coming here because my coworkers kept sniffing the air and wondering ""what's that smell?"". Real talk.Oh, and try the rice pancake with egg!"
/user_details?userid=3j9JpQ6dNM5k8C6hsocqBg,Achina S.,"Barrington, RI",5 star rating,We passed this place while walking by several times over the last couple days. We knew we should eat there because there was always a line out the door and we were not disappointed. We spent $60 for 4 adults. Everything we ate was fantastic although I would never remember the long Vietnamese names of them. The service was amazingly fast.
/user_details?userid=ecKErQELcFy4x-6wbgh8eA,Bill C.,"Albany, CA",4 star rating,After seeing the reviews on Yelp I decided to try this place one evening and was not disappointed.  Since then I order take out at least once per week.  Even though it is  common to see a line at the door (and sometime outside) it never takes more than 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. I usually get lemon grass chicken or beef (creature of habit) that is as good as any that I have had anywhere else.  The gentlemen at the counter is always pleasant and appears happy to see me once again.

/user_details?userid=wFNy6-gTb6_lj7qwGUPhPA,Grass R.,"Beverly, MA",1 star rating,One waiter who served us probably was an owner and was absolutely not customer service oriented and was almost rude to us. Not sure about foods either.
/user_details?userid=AaNVt0_Y8q5h6O5Kmk5nMQ,Mari S.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"I$10 for bun is a bit steep for the area and the spring rolls were very strange. However last time we came the chicken was very old, the pho came out lukewarm and the owner obviously did not care about his food quality or customers."
/user_details?userid=powyaZiYVSVpk6wPZ5k43A,Kevin S.,"Newton, MA",5 star rating,"One of if not the best pho in Montreal (was highly recommended by a friend who lived there for 7 years). Did not disappoint - service was prompt, atmosphere was lively during lunchtime, food was authentic, and prices were reasonable."
/user_details?userid=hbtyK6igokmXUq1aFqOV2A,Emily J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent pho, green papaya salad, and fried banana."
/user_details?userid=LG_Ck8wMURmrZmh9_oa2qA,Dan L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Clean wise borderline acceptable; the washroom could be cleaner and they could replace the old tables and chairs. The place is simply too small to go eat in groups but if you're looking to go in, (wait in line), eat and go out than the place is fine. I would say a group of maximum 4 people is OK since they only have 1 table for 8 people or so and the rest is for 4 or 2. The Pho is not the best Pho in town but the place sure is one of the most popular."
/user_details?userid=tZJrGa3bgOtqdrmnURamDA,Rebecca A.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"If you are looking for fast, delicious, well priced pho - this is the place to go! No bells no whistles, just great food. I call ahead for pick up because lines can be lengthy during peak dinner hours. But fun to sit and stay in too!"
