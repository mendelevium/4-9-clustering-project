/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Served in more than 5,000 shops in Tokyo alone, and 24,000 across Japan, ramen, is revered for its complex depth of flavours of the broth to the perfect chewy and characteristic yellow colour of the noodles.This traditional Japanese dish made with noodles, broth and slices of meat, actually originated in China before making it's way to Japan. One theory states is it was first introduced to Japan by a neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui when he brought the recipe when he escaped th√© Manchurian rule in China to serve feudal lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni as an advisor. Unfortunately no historical record of Shunsui actually cooking ramen for Mitsukuni exists.Hence most historians reject this theory in favour of the more plausible story that Ramen was introduced by Chinese immigrants in late 19th-20th century at Yokahama's Chinatown.Back in Montreal, after being deeply influenced by an unexpected encounter with the ""Mama"" who operates the original named Tokyo based Izakaya on Nakamichi Street (Japanese gastropub), Chef Jumpei Iwakiri recently opened Nakamichi, which operates as a Ramen bar by day and a full service Izakaya in the evening. Here we had the chance to try a bowl of the spicy Hakata ramen made with tonkotsu pork broth with its milky complexion, deep savoury taste and full, silky texture. Behind the kitchen was Xavier and Ben, respectively from Melbourne and Sydney, who explains that the reason why the broth milky white, unctuous in texture, is thanks to pork marrow bones and fat cooked for hours, simmered to smithereens. This said there are many variations of ramen and the collagen-rich mouth feeling does not always agree with everyone's taste buds.Cher Jumpei's passion for good cooking, high-quality ingredients, and welcoming ambiance is definitely well felt and supported by a wonderful staff. If you come early, you'll also catch his wife, Yuri Ishikawa, who keeps an eye on the operations. Hope to come back to try some of the evening options!"
