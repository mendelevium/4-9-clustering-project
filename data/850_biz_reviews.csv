/user_details?userid=fpotsL9JJJUzFb8A4_ewZQ,Nancy G.,"CA, CA",5 star rating,Upscale place with reasonable prices and great ambiance.I was walking by on my way to more expensive Italian restaurant and saw that the chef was Italian and knew the food would be good and it definitely delivered.
/user_details?userid=NZMcnwHhSNqDjUdABIeUcg,Nicole L.,"Gatineau, Canada",3 star rating,The restaurant is very cool as was our waitress' haircut but the clam linguine I had wasn't the best I've tasted but it was good.
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So... I was not sure if I was feeling some pasta on that day. I went in being flexible on the food I wanted to get. The waiter told me about the soups available and I was immediately sold on the clam chowder soup and the virgin caesar drink. The service was impeccable and the waiters were nice and courteous. The soup does not have a milky appearance like I thought and it was still good. I like that they cut out small pieces of clams and everything is well proportioned out on the soup. The virgin caesar was sweet and a bit bitter just as I like it. I asked to remove the tabasco sauce so it does not have that spicy taste. Overall, good experience and I will certainly come back to try their desserts."

As I approached on a Tuesday around 9pm they were preparing to close but the owner Camilo and his lady partner were outside and greeted me very warmly, ushered me in to have some dessert. My server, Cara, was very sweet and perfectly attentive. I was encouraged to try the panna cotta and I'm glad I did, it was delicious. Followed by a decaf latte I was perfectly set for the night. Will return"

I asked for linguini and peso off the menu and it was very good. Service was amazing, and the caprese salad was so good. Highly recommend to try it out."
/user_details?userid=vCJdknkyuqaqN_r6mXqI4Q,Kevin O.,"Stoneham, MA",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing! Family of 6, we loved every bite. Me and 16 year old son got the Salmon with sautéed vegetables, wife got the Veal, and my three girls split a couple of pizzas. Deserts were perfect; with 6 of us we got one of everything and we all fought over each. Beignets with nutella were great for safe choice. Panna Cotta was light and delicious. Creme brûlée was very good. Beignets, Sorbet, and Gelato were big hits with the kids. Price was on par with Old Montreal but great fit with the kids and food was worth every bit."
/user_details?userid=3iyLeuOiy-ZU88duX1aPIA,Angelina D.,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"To be honest, I have no idea why this place has only three reviews! Good for lunch and dinners! We've ordered some starters, pasta and risotto for the mains. Everything tasted great! Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Prices are good as well, especially if you would compare to the restaurants near by"
