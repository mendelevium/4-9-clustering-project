/user_details?userid=C8eZBwelq3pGYACAcDWzgQ,Tracy W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing local spot that was close to our airbnb. We came at 3 pm, an off hour, so it was pretty empty inside. Having just gotten off our flight and feeling super hungry, this was a great first meal in Montreal. I ordered the carbonara pasta, and the sauce on it was so creamy and delicious. Ordered a latte as well, which was yummy and came in a cute little teacup. The service here is amazing. Our waitress was SO sweet and accommodating. Had a lovely conversation with her, where she gave us recommendations of what to do in Montreal. Even took the time to look up directions and details to those places. Maybe it's because I'm from NYC and not used to this kind of service, but I appreciated it so much! Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5Value: 4/5"
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Recently went back to this café with a friend. I forgot how much a love it. We went during a decent 5 à 7 the wine and pints of beer were priced at 5$...not bad at all. Plus for a Thursday 5 à 7 it was calm and chill. A really good place to chat with good friends. The waitress was smiley and attentive which I appreciated. I am only taking a star off because the food isn't the best. We ordered nachos and they were over cooked. A good portion of the cheese was encrusted on the plate it was served. That made me sad haha. Check the photos out otherwise. The place is gorgeous!

The lady behind the bar said I could only order a drink if I also ordered food. I browsed the room and saw there were people there who only ordered drinks without food. Figured they were trying to milk me so I ordered the cheapest food I could get. Lady hunted me down about adding a tip, guess she did not realize I spent the tip on the food I never wanted in the first place."

However, I'm glad I didn't review this place the first time I went in, because it was in the evening and it wasn't working for me as a dinner restaurant *at all*. But, BREAKFAST MENU FTW! New fave. I can tell this place will beckon me every Sunday AM.Truly yummy and perfectly cooked brekkies. Also, not too, too much food on your plate, so you're only feeling half guilty after pigging out on bacon (nicely balanced with that fresh side of fruit). Believe me, you'll be satisfied while escaping the so-full-it-hurts breakfast out syndrome. Great espresso-based coffees, super friendly wait staff, LIVE PIANO by an accomplished pianist who sways like Stevie Wonder, and a cozy-like-grandmother's-kitchen vibe. If you're feeling homesick for the family, come bask in the vintage wallpaper and warm energies here. It's church for the eggs and bacon congregation. Glad it's so close by!"

If you want to impress someone in how cool you are and you know your local Cafe, bring him here, the place doesnt only looks cool the Coffee here is GREAT and the Croissant was extremely tasty as well. I found my new ""need coffee in the area- to go place"""
/user_details?userid=yE_1xqFxNkhQN8X-nL3cBA,Alice C.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Mediocre coffee, nice waitstaff, but due to understaffing, we couldn't even hunt ours down for a coffee refill on a weekday brunch.Food was less than exciting. Not bad, but I can definitely make better myself at home. Two poorly scrambled eggs (yellow and white distinctly separate), a few pieces of cheddar cut from a block, two slices of deli ham, a hard baguette piece =$12. Huh?Too many great brunch places to bother with this one."

/user_details?userid=5l4PETuuSGccqwM_uf_3YA,Jordan S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Oh boy when your still drunk and awake from nuit Blanche 2016, does this place come in handy. It was nice of the manager to let us in 30 min early to escape the Sunday snow. It's a cool café that beyond my expectations, the crepe I ordered resembled a pancake. That's how thick the crepe was, perfect for brunch and deliciously goes well with fruit and yes le maple syrup, which makes any type of crepe super."
/user_details?userid=O004e8vRsmmFsZi5_RVuJA,David P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"The world needs more places like Cafe Les Entretiens. Simply delicious food in a laid-back, neighborhood-style place. Entretiens has a very nice retro space that looks like it wouldn't be at all out of place in Paris, without being at all kitschy or pretentious. When people wax nostalgic about their favorite old urban neighborhoods in the style of Jane Jacobs, they have places like this in mind. Halfway through our dinner, one of the other patrons sat down at their piano and serenaded the restaurant with sweet sweet music! Tres romantiqueThe food is delicious overall. I started out with the warm vegetable soup, which was simple yet satisfying, while my partner had the cold cucumber soup. I didn't care for the cold cucumber, but then again I can't help but compare all cold soups to gazpacho. Their osso bucco was rich and juicy on a bed of orzo pasta, practically melting right off the bone. Entretiens' carrot cake was one of the best I've ever tasted. This cafe is very reasonably priced, with all of the entrees below $20 and most wines at $30 or below.Entretiens is one of the best values in the Plateau neighborhood, and with a wonderful relaxed Montrealais atmosphere that is to die for. It won't be winning any Michelin stars, but it is well worth a visit if you're in the area."

/user_details?userid=VnKj044Tt5doqaVDIJbWsw,Ian P.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Definitely a nice place for breakfast/brunch.  They have a fairly standard breakfast selection with everything from omelettes to a couple choices of eggs benedict.The FOOD was generally fairly good.  The eggs in my eggs benedict were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was rich and well-made.  The sides suffered a bit...the potatoes were bland and overcooked like you'd expect in a cheap diner.  It was lovely to get fruit on the side, but there were some weird omissions, like they didn't bother to peel the kiwi before slicing it.  My friend pronounced his omelette (which was huge) decent but not exceptional.  Coffee was pretty bad.The SERVICE was again a bit ""meh"".  There was only one other table occupied when we sat down, but we were pretty thoroughly ignored for most of our meal.  We thought that once they figured out that we were Anglophone, they were a bit cold to us.   Our server essentially vanished after bringing the meal, and we had to pay at the counter before leaving.  If there were free coffee refills, we definitely didn't get any.The AMBIANCE though is lovely with very high ceilings, a well-decorated classic space, and lots of light and open windows.  Not a bad breakfast, but definitely wouldn't rush to come back."

Music can be really a nice ambiance, excellent staff.The menu is not very exciting and the food was pretty below-par.Ingredients were nice but it was amateur in delivery. Despite the not-amazing food, the restaurant made a very nice place for a party because of the spacious ambiance and laid-back vibe.Avoid the food but go for nibbles and drinks."

/user_details?userid=W7rNiyDjfTPL60vRTlA4nw,Californian I.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Since this cafe doesn't have a menu, I wanted to help in that department:They offer a few different types of salads (I remember one was a smoked salmon salad, another a hot chevre), three types of burgers (none of which were vegetarian, to my friend's disappointment), several types of sandwiches (my friend had the apple cheddar sandwich with pesto mayo; she gave it high marks!), and two croques: a monsieur and a veggie one. The menu has maybe 4-5 desserts, of which I remember reading about a chocolate souffle cake, a carrot cake, a pudding chomeur d'erable, and I believe it was either a panna cotta or a creme brulee.With the sandwiches, you get a choice of salad or fries or half of each. The salad was very fresh and perfectly dressed. I had the croque monsieur, which was fine, nothing special but at $10 (which included a big salad of lettuce, shredded carrots and shredded beets) it was totally fine.  The service was great---really attentive, and she let us linger without pressuring us to order anything more.I might not rush back for the food, as it wasn't something incredibly memorable, but it was a pleasant place to hang out, has a good vibe. I appreciate the friendly, neighborhood feel that the staff cultivate."

/user_details?userid=blk34cyfbRjKHjPgWS5mAQ,Tracy S.,"Williamsburg, VA",4 star rating,"We specifically sought out this cafe last night for our last night in Montreal.  It lived up to everything the previous reviewers said -- great, casual food, good wine and beer, wonderful service and a real fabulous atmosphere.  We lived in Amsterdam for years and this cafe could have been transplanted from there.  In a fun neighborhood and just a great place to spend 2 or 3 hours."
