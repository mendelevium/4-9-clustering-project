/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We got a single chicken burrito from Ke Paso through Uber Eats. It came fairly quickly, wrapped in a foil paper. The flavor was good, the meat, rice and beans were tender and not dry. The total was around 11$, which is a bit pricey for a small burrito, but it is for the convenience of food delivery after all!Would order again ~"
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Delivery order through Uber Eats that I am disputing with the delivery company. Ordered 2 quesadilla meals (quesadillas with meat - unlisted protein - chips and salsa, drink and churros) + 2 orders of chips and salsa. Menu price $20. Received two barely-there quesadillas, no cheese let alone other filling, and one-to-two serving of chips (instead of 4) split into two bags. The sauces were absolutely terrible - even the sour cream was watered down. No drinks were included either. STAY AWAY!!!"
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great tacos. Various meat choices. Tasty and juicy. They actually have an amazing deal on Friday and Saturday night where all tacos are $2. Awesome!
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had wondered if this place was going to be on the cookie cutter or authentic side when I saw they were about to open.Since I only tried a few $2 tacos, I will mainly comment on them, but did find out they make everything in-house and with no microwaves or even freezers (if I heard correctly). They offer 6 fillings at least and I tried the pulled pork, pulled beef and al pastor. They were all above average and went well with the toppings (corn nibble too) and sour cream. Guacamole is extra, but you can get cilantro, lime and spicy mayo on them if you ask.The two dollar deal is usually after midnight, but for International Taco Day was on offer all day. A Mexican friend tried three and I two. We both had the same comment about the meat being so portioned out; it was glaringly obvious. I know it's $2, and they can't pile it on, but perhaps there's a happy balance between. My friend actually dumped the meat from one into the other and left the Tortilla on the side (which I ate).Apart from the quantity thing, the quality of the ingredients and tastes were quite nice --- plus the homemade aspect, service with smile and one of the hard-working owners on-site kept the rating up."
/user_details?userid=tYgDilwjBzWt7djhdZNL9A,Anna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"Food is okay. The people working are very kind every time I go. Real problem is coming here and paying $10 for a bowl with maybe half the portion size of a Chipotle bowl that tastes half as good-- maybe company policy, but still disappointing. What really made me go crazy was watching someone order a bowl with no protein and extra beans instead, and they received less than a spoon of beans. They're stingy with everything from the beans to the lettuce here (will give you three pieces and have an attitude if you want more)-- make the same mediocrity at home and save your money. Or go next door to Frite Alors and have a real meal."

/user_details?userid=fMZPwGINttohQgeA85TaKA,Maureen A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I ordered a shredded beef rice bowl via DoorDash and the result was a tasteless, dry, sad-looking meal. They skimped on the cheese and sour cream (maybe a teaspoon of each) and the price on DoorDash ended up being a ridiculous $23."
/user_details?userid=StHrYkufWcuDpYrENGS8sA,Jacqueline R.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Ordered three burritos over a delivery app. Rice was brittle, the pork was dry. On the positive side, the vegetables were crisp and delicious. Still, for the potions given and quality of the food, this is not worth it."
/user_details?userid=tx98UkEBADRi4gy6sSrklA,Sannah R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I ordered a taco and it was very disappointing. Barely anything in the tacos and they were very small. Would not order again. Also their spicy salsa is just regular salsa with way too many chilli flakes on top. Ridiculous.
