The restaurant is spacious. Even though we we're many, there was plenty of space and we didn't feel crammed. Compared to other places they dont have as much variety of meat to choose from. However, i was satisfied by what they had. The marinade tastes good. They could add some more vegetables to their menu!One thing that annoyed me is the gas. During the course of dinner, we had to ask the waiter to change the gas 3 times. Also, be ready to smell, there is very little ventilation inside."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very decent BBQ on wellington, near metro de l'eglise. It's all you can eat for around 28$. The meat's quality is pretty good and the snacks and other dishes are tasty as well. I love their fried chicken so much. It's bite sized, crispy and not too oily. There aren't as many choices on the menu as other places, but there are enough to be satisfied. The service is good. The waiters are friendly and came to change our water frequently. You can ask to clean up grill once in a while, but they don't change it completely. They just wipe the burnt stuff on it. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Disappointing first impression. Tried to make a reservation for about half an hour, though nobody was answering. Decided to show up instead and the young waitress seemed incredibly disinterested in helping us. She told us all available tables (roughly 4) were all reserved for 45 minutes later (we arrived at 7:15 and reservations were for 8) so we couldnt be seated. And then she just stared at us, as if ""why are you still here?"" Felt strongly like our business was unwanted. Which was a shame because we were really excited to try this place!What would have been great would have been some willingness to help; an offer to come back in half an hour, if we were willing to wait (we were); to add our names to waitlist, etc. This disinterest in customer service now leaves me less inclined to come back here again."

/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of the best Korean BBQ in town. The meats cuts and the way they are marinating them is just perfect! But what really makes this place stands out is their appetizers!
/user_details?userid=urvMX2_55JzYIIZXXLoOgg,Michael B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,My girlfriend and I are here at least twice a month. I've been to multiple all you can eats and this one takes the cake. Quality of food Friendly staff and bring your own wine. My biggest tip is to put in a big order first so you have food coming for a while in waves. This prevents getting frustrated because the place gets very busy! This was my first stop when I came in from Boston recently. Literally from airport to here. Truly our favorite resto in verdun. -Michael and Geena
